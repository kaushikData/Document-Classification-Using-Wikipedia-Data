{"id": "53105209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53105209", "title": "A Decent Ride", "text": "A Decent Ride\n\nA Decent Ride is a 2015 novel by Irvine Welsh. Welsh returns to his character Terry Lawson, first introduced in \"Glue\", this book taking place a further 10 years after the events of \"Porno\" during the 2011 Scottish Hurricane Bawbag. The book's title is a double-entendre on Lawson's sexual prowess, and his job in this novel as a taxi driver.\n\nTerry Lawson, having met writers through giving them lifts during the Edinburgh Festival, decides that a literary education will aid him in his relentless sexual escapades and help him overcome his own loss of virility. He also meets Wee Jonty—a well-endowed, nice-but-dim character, similar to \"Porno\"'s Curtis—whose girlfriend Jinty Magdalen has gone missing. Lawson agrees to help track her down, his \"investigations\" making him question the motivations of a prominent American businessman and TV star Ronald Checker (a pastiche of Donald Trump) and his role in Jinty's disappearance. The book's narration alternates between Lawson, Jonty and Checker.\n\n\"The Financial Times\" identified the Checker character as \"a Donald Trump-esque tycoon, with a grand, possibly devious, business plan.\". Welsh himself told the \"Washington Post\" that Checker was “ a youthful, punkish version of Donald Trump”, though the paper reflected that \"as obnoxious as this character [Checker] is, he doesn’t come close to his real-world model [Trump]\" Trump was prominent in Scotland at the time the novel was set, developing an environmentally controversial golf course and publicly supporting Scottish Government policies (a theme within the book) while it suited his business needs, before falling out with Alex Salmond over his support for wind turbines—the novel plays on this and imagines and infers his sexual proclivities. Trump's subsequent rise to the presidency make the novel more relevant in its satire and its conceit of being 'taken for a ride' than it seemed at time of release. When challenged later on his opinions of Trump, Welsh stated that Checker was \"a generic kind of demagogue\" but that subsequent to the novel's release that \"Trump...since he lost Iowa, has become more interesting. He's like some kind of game show participant.\"\n\nThe novel was reviewed in many newspapers. It received mixed reviews.\n\nWelsh's own website chose to cite Claire Inman of Curious Animal Magazine, who felt that “Whether your interest is piqued by the ridiculously expensive bottles of whiskey and the extraordinary lengths an American will go to own them or your heart strings are pulled by Wee Jonty’s anguished love story, there’s a multitude of ideas and human emotions that Welsh brings out among the laughter.”, and a review for \"The Spectator\", in which James Walton suggested that “Irvine Welsh is not a writer who’s mellowing with age... Welsh’s [language is an] astonishingly supple invention: one that can combine scabrousness and lyricism, comedy and ruefulness in the same paragraph... [if] you fancy an authentic and often thrilling blast of full-strength Irvine Welsh, then you’re in for a treat.”\n\nHowever, in a review titled \"Poor Writing and Penis Jokes\" Stuart Kelly felt that he \"could have spent this entire review analysing Welsh’s sexual politics – but what would be the point? The tired old rebuttal is 'it’s a satire and you don’t have a sense of humour'. But listen. What’s that? It’s the sound of no one laughing. There is a faint and distant sniggering, though. If anyone parts with £12.99 for this, they’re being taken for a ride.\"\n"}

Contrary to its title, the book is a work of fiction and not an actual account of history.\n\nPeter Mayer, the publisher of Overlook Press, doubted the veracity of the book and the history that it was said to contain; nevertheless, he agreed to publish it. Violin dealers and stringed instrument publications quickly refuted the existence of a musical genre called \"funerary violin,\" as reported by \"The New York Times\".\n\nDefending his decision to publish the book, Mayer said:\n\nBook stores that have agreed to stock the book are unsure how to categorize it. The book does not really belong in fiction because it is not a typical narrative, but the art history section would also be incorrect because much \"historical\" fact has been invented.\n\nKriwaczek argues that his book is neither a hoax nor an attempt to mislead. He issued a statement on October 5, 2006 saying that he wanted to \"expand the notion of musical composition to encompass the creation of an entire artistic genre, with its necessary accompanying history, mythology, philosophy, social function, etc.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5875567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5875567", "title": "Boombal", "text": "Boombal\n\nBoombal (pl. Boombals) is a relatively recent phenomenon of folk dance parties in Belgium, originating in the French bal folk. The partygoers indulge in pair, ring, line, and string dances such as the waltz, polka, An Dro, etc. adapted from the French bal folk scene. The events are seen as a more social and enjoyable alternative to the individualistic dancing that is often seen in modern clubs. There is a very low barrier of entrance due to the emphasis on having fun rather than meticulously performed and complicated dances.\n\nBoombal originated in Ghent, Belgium when accordion instructor Wim Claeys wanted his students to play to a real dance audience. The first Boombal was organised in September 2000 in an old furniture shop, with about 5 couples participating. This shop was located in the Boomstraat (lit. tree-street), which is how the event got its name. A year later, the Boombal concept had grown immensely and with over 100 participants the event was relocated to the Volkshuis van de Dampoort in Ghent. Soon, another move was necessary to the even bigger intercultural centre 'De Centrale'.\n\nIn 2006, Boombal is an established and popular concept in Belgium, organised mostly in and around various student cities. In the Netherlands, similar events are popping up, under the name Folkbal. The idea is slowly gaining popularity in other neighbouring countries as well.\n\nA Boombal typically consists of two parts:\n\n1. Initiation\n\nIn about an hour, an instructor will demonstrate and teach various dances. Popular ones include Schottische, Gigues and Bourrées. The emphasis is on dances that can be performed with two or more people at the time.\n\n2. Party\n\nProfessional folk musicians play live music to which the various learned dances are performed en masse. There is a lot of interplay between the audience and the musicians. A typical session lasts about two hours.\n\n"}

{"id": "52847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52847", "title": "Children's literature", "text": "Children's literature\n\nChildren's literature or juvenile literature includes stories, books, magazines, and poems that are enjoyed by children. Modern children's literature is classified in two different ways: genre or the intended age of the reader.\n\nChildren's literature can be traced to stories and songs, part of a wider oral tradition, that adults shared with children before publishing existed. The development of early children's literature, before printing was invented, is difficult to trace. Even after printing became widespread, many classic \"children's\" tales were originally created for adults and later adapted for a younger audience. Since the fifteenth century much literature has been aimed specifically at children, often with a moral or religious message. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is known as the \"Golden Age of Children's Literature\", because many classic children's books were published then.\n\nThere is no single or widely used definition of children's literature. It can be broadly defined as anything that children read or more specifically defined as fiction, non-fiction, poetry, or drama intended for and used by children and young people. One writer on children's literature defines it as \"all books written for children, excluding works such as comic books, joke books, cartoon books, and non-fiction works that are not intended to be read from front to back, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference materials\". However, others would argue that comics should also be included: \"Children's Literature studies has traditionally treated comics fitfully and superficially despite the importance of comics as a global phenomenon associated with children\".\n\nThe \"International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature\" notes that \"the boundaries of genre ... are not fixed but blurred\". Sometimes, no agreement can be reached about whether a given work is best categorized as literature for adults or children. Some works defy easy categorization. J.K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" series was written and marketed for young adults, but it is also popular among adults. The series' extreme popularity led \"The New York Times\" to create a separate best-seller list for children's books.\n\nDespite the widespread association of children's literature with picture books, spoken narratives existed before printing, and the root of many children's tales go back to ancient storytellers. Seth Lerer, in the opening of \"Children's Literature: A Reader's History from Aesop to Harry Potter\", says, \"This book presents a history of what children have heard and read ... The history I write of is a history of \"reception\".\"\n\nEarly children's literature consisted of spoken stories, songs, and poems that were used to educate, instruct, and entertain children.\nIt was only in the eighteenth century, with the development of the concept of childhood, that a separate genre of children's literature began to emerge, with its own divisions, expectations, and canon. The earliest of these books were educational books, books on conduct, and simple ABCs--often decorated with animals, plants, and anthropomorphic letters. \n\nIn 1962, French historian Philippe Ariès argues in his book \"Centuries of Childhood\" that the modern concept of childhood only emerged in recent times. He explains that children were in the past not considered as greatly different from adults and were not given significantly different treatment. As evidence for this position, he notes that, apart from instructional and didactic texts for children written by clerics like the Venerable Bede and Ælfric of Eynsham, there was a lack of any genuine literature aimed specifically at children before the 18th century.\n\nOther scholars have qualified this viewpoint by noting that there was a literature designed to convey the values, attitudes, and information necessary for children within their cultures, such as the \"Play of Daniel\" from the 12th century. Pre-modern children's literature, therefore, tended to be of a didactic and moralistic nature, with the purpose of conveying conduct-related, educational and religious lessons.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the concept of childhood began to emerge in Europe. Adults saw children as separate beings, innocent and in need of protection and training by the adults around them. The English philosopher John Locke developed his theory of the tabula rasa in his 1690 \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\". In Locke's philosophy, \"tabula rasa\" was the theory that the (human) mind is at birth a \"blank slate\" without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's sensory experiences. A corollary of this doctrine was that the mind of the child was born blank and that it was the duty of the parents to imbue the child with correct notions. Locke himself emphasized the importance of providing children with \"easy pleasant books\" to develop their minds rather than using force to compel them; \"children may be cozen'd into a knowledge of the letters; be taught to read, without perceiving it to be anything but a sport, and play themselves into that which others are whipp'd for.\" He also suggested that picture books be created for children.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, a few children's titles became famous as classroom reading texts. Among these were the fables of Aesop and Jean de la Fontaine and Charles Perraults's 1697 \"Tales of Mother Goose\". The popularity of these texts led to the creation of a number of nineteenth century fantasy and fairy tales for children which featured magic objects and talking animals. \n\nAnother influence on this shift in attitudes came from Puritanism, which stressed the importance of individual salvation. Puritans were concerned with the spiritual welfare of their children, and there was a large growth in the publication of \"good godly books\" aimed squarely at children. Some of the most popular works were by James Janeway, but the most enduring book from this movement, still read today, especially In modernised versions, is \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" (1678) by John Bunyan.\n\nChapbooks, pocket-sized pamphlets that were often folded instead of being stitched, were published in Britain; illustrated by woodblock printing, these inexpensive booklets reprinted popular ballads, historical re-tellings, and folk tales. Though not specifically published for children at this time, young people enjoyed the booklets as well. Johanna Bradley says, in \"From Chapbooks to Plum Cake\", that chapbooks kept imaginative stories from being lost to readers under the strict Puritan influence of the time.\n\nHornbooks also appeared in England during this time, teaching children basic information such as the alphabet and the Lord's Prayer. These were brought from England to the American colonies in the mid-17th century. The first such book was a catechism for children written in verse by the Puritan John Cotton. Known as \"Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes\", it was published in 1646, appearing both in England and Boston. Another early book, \"The New England Primer\", was in print by 1691 and used in schools for 100 years. The primer begins, \"In Adam's fall We sinned all ...\", and continues through the alphabet. It also contained religious maxims, acronyms, spelling help and other educational items, all decorated by woodcuts.\n\nIn 1634, the \"Pentamerone\" from Italy became the first major published collection of European folk tales. Charles Perrault began recording fairy tales in France, publishing his first collection in 1697. They were not well received among the French literary society, who saw them as only fit for old people and children. In 1658, Jan Ámos Comenius in Bohemia published the informative illustrated \"Orbis Pictus\", for children under six learning to read. It is considered to be the first picture book produced specifically for children.\n\nThe first Danish children's book was \"The Child's Mirror\" by Niels Bredal in 1568, an adaptation of a Courtesy book by the Dutch priest Erasmus. \"A Pretty and Splendid Maiden's Mirror\", an adaptation of a German book for young women, became the first Swedish children's book upon its 1591 publication. Sweden published fables and a children's magazine by 1766.\n\nIn Italy, Giovanni Francesco Straparola released \"The Facetious Nights of Straparola\" in the 1550s. Called the first European storybook to contain fairy-tales, it eventually had 75 separate stories and written for an adult audience. Giulio Cesare Croce also borrowed from stories children enjoyed for his books.\n\nRussia's earliest children's books, primers, appeared in the late 16th century. An early example is \"ABC-Book\", an alphabet book published by Ivan Fyodorov in 1571. The first picture book published in Russia, Karion Istomin's \"The Illustrated Primer\", appeared in 1694. Peter the Great's interest in modernizing his country through Westernization helped Western children's literature dominate the field through the 18th century. Catherine the Great wrote allegories for children, and during her reign, Nikolai Novikov started the first juvenile magazine in Russia.\n\nThe modern children's book emerged in mid-18th-century England. A growing polite middle-class and the influence of Lockean theories of childhood innocence combined to create the beginnings of childhood as a concept. \"A Little Pretty Pocket-Book\", written and published by John Newbery, is widely considered the first modern children's book, published in 1744. It was a landmark as the first children's publication aimed at giving enjoyment to children, containing a mixture of rhymes, picture stories and games for pleasure. Newbery believed that play was a better enticement to children's good behavior than physical discipline, and the child was to record his or her behavior daily.\n\nThe book was child–sized with a brightly colored cover that appealed to children—something new in the publishing industry. Known as gift books, these early books became the precursors to the toy books popular in the 19th century. Newbery was also adept at marketing this new genre. According to the journal \"The Lion and the Unicorn\", \"Newbery's genius was in developing the fairly new product category, children's books, through his frequent advertisements ... and his clever ploy of introducing additional titles and products into the body of his children's books.\"\n\nThe improvement in the quality of books for children, as well as the diversity of topics he published, helped make Newbery the leading producer of children's books in his time. He published his own books as well as those by authors such as Samuel Johnson and Oliver Goldsmith; the latter may have written \"The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes\", Newbery's most popular book.\n\nAnother philosopher who influenced the development of children's literature was Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who argued that children should be allowed to develop naturally and joyously. His idea of appealing to a children's natural interests took hold among writers for children. Popular examples included Thomas Day's \"The History of Sandford and Merton\", four volumes that embody Rousseau's theories. Furthermore, Maria and Richard Lovell Edgeworth's \"Practical Education: The History of Harry and Lucy\" (1780) urged children to teach themselves.\n\nRousseau's ideas also had great influence in Germany, especially on German Philanthropism, a movement concerned with reforming both education and literature for children. Its founder, Johann Bernhard Basedow, authored \"Elementarwerk\" as a popular textbook for children that included many illustrations by Daniel Chodowiecki. Another follower, Joachim Heinrich Campe, created an adaptation of \"Robinson Crusoe\" that went into over 100 printings. He became Germany's \"outstanding and most modern\" writer for children. According to Hans-Heino Ewers in \"The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature\", \"It can be argued that from this time, the history of European children's literature was largely written in Germany.\"\n\nThe Brothers Grimm preserved and published the traditional tales told in Germany. They were so popular in their home country that modern, realistic children's literature began to be looked down on there. This dislike of non-traditional stories continued there until the beginning of the next century. The Grimms's contribution to children's literature goes beyond their collection of stories, as great as that is. As professors, they had a scholarly interest in the stories, striving to preserve them and their variations accurately, recording their sources. \n\nA similar project was carried out by the Norwegian scholars Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, who collected Norwegian fairy tales and published them as \"Norwegian Folktales\", often referred to as \"Asbjørnsen and Moe\". By compiling these stories, they preserved Norway's literary heritage and helped create the Norwegian written language.\n\nDanish author and poet Hans Christian Andersen traveled through Europe and gathered many well-known fairy tales and created new stories in the fairy tale genre. \n\nIn Switzerland, Johann David Wyss published \"The Swiss Family Robinson\" in 1812, with the aim of teaching children about family values, good husbandry, the uses of the natural world and self-reliance. The book became popular across Europe after it was translated into French by Isabelle de Montolieu.\n\nE. T. A. Hoffmann's tale \"The Nutcracker and the Mouse King\" was published in 1816 in a German collection of stories for children, \"Kinder-Märchen\". It is the first modern short story to introduce bizarre, odd and grotesque elements in children's literature and thereby anticipates Lewis Carroll's tale, \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". There are not only parallels concerning the content (the weird adventures of a young girl in a fantasy land), but also the origin of the tales as both are dedicated and given to a daughter of the author's friends.\n\nThe shift to a modern genre of children's literature occurred in the mid-19th century; didacticism of a previous age began to make way for more humorous, child-oriented books, more attuned to the child's imagination. The availability of children's literature greatly increased as well, as paper and printing became widely available and affordable, the population grew and literacy rates improved.\n\n\"Tom Brown's School Days\" by Thomas Hughes appeared in 1857, and is considered to be the founding book in the school story tradition. However, it was Lewis Carroll's fantasy, \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", published in 1865 in England, that signaled the change in writing style for children to an imaginative and empathetic one. Regarded as the first \"English masterpiece written for children\" and as a founding book in the development of fantasy literature, its publication opened the \"First Golden Age\" of children's literature in Britain and Europe that continued until the early 1900s. Another important book of that decade was \"The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby\", by Reverend Charles Kingsley (1862), which became extremely popular in England, and remains a classic of British children's literature.\n\nIn 1883, Carlo Collodi wrote the first Italian fantasy novel, \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\", which was translated many times. In that same year, Emilio Salgari, the man who would become \"the adventure writer par excellence for the young in Italy\" first published his legendary character \"Sandokan\". In Britain, \"The Princess and the Goblin\" and its sequel \"The Princess and Curdie\", by George MacDonald, appeared in 1872 and 1883, and the adventure stories \"Treasure Island\" and \"Kidnapped\", both by Robert Louis Stevenson, were extremely popular in the 1880s. Rudyard Kipling's \"The Jungle Book\" was first published in 1894, and J. M. Barrie told the story of Peter Pan in the novel \"Peter and Wendy\" in 1911. Johanna Spyri's two-part novel \"Heidi\" was published in Switzerland in 1880 and 1881. In the US, children's publishing entered a period of growth after the American Civil War in 1865. Boys' book writer Oliver Optic published over 100 books. In 1868, the \"epoch-making book\" \"Little Women\", the fictionalized autobiography of Louisa May Alcott, was published. This \"coming of age\" story established the genre of realistic family books in the United States. Mark Twain released \"Tom Sawyer\" in 1876, and in 1880 another bestseller, \"\", a collection of African American folk tales adapted and compiled by Joel Chandler Harris, appeared.\n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a plethora of children's novels began featuring realistic, non-magical plotlines. Certain titles received international success such as Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\" (1883), L.M. Montgomery's \"Anne of Green Gables\" (1908), and Louisa May Alcott's \"Little Women\" (1869) \n\nThe Chinese Revolution of 1911 and World War II brought political and social change that revolutionized children's literature in China. Western science, technology, and literature became fashionable. China's first modern publishing firm, Commercial Press, established several children's magazines, which included \"Youth Magazine\", and \"Educational Pictures for Children\". The first Chinese children's writer was Sun Yuxiu, an editor of Commercial Press, whose story \"The Kingdom Without a Cat\" was written in the language of the time instead of the classical style used previously. Yuxiu encouraged novelist Shen Dehong to write for children as well. Dehong went on to rewrite 28 stories based on classical Chinese literature specifically for children. In 1932, Zhang Tianyi published \"Big Lin and Little Lin\", the first full-length Chinese novel for children.\n\nThe Chinese Revolution of 1949 changed children's literature again. Many children's writers were denounced, but Tianyi and Ye Shengtao continued to write for children and created works that aligned with Maoist ideology. The 1976 death of Mao Zedong provoked more changes that swept China. Many writers from the early part of the century were brought back, and their work became available again. In 1990, \"General Anthology of Modern Children's Literature of China\", a fifteen-volume anthology of children's literature since the 1920s, was released.\n\nLiterature for children developed as a separate category of literature especially in the Victorian era. Some works became internationally known, such as those of Lewis Carroll, \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (1865) and its sequel \"Through the Looking-Glass\". At the end of the Victorian era and leading into the Edwardian era, Beatrix Potter was an author and illustrator, best known for her children's books, which featured animal characters. In her thirties, Potter published \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\" in 1902. Potter eventually went on to publish 23 children's books and become a wealthy woman. Michael O. Tunnell and James S. Jacobs, professors of children’s literature at Brigham Young University, write, \"Potter was the first to use pictures as well as words to tell the story, incorporating coloured illustration with text, page for page.\" Another classic of the period is Anna Sewell's animal novel \"Black Beauty\" (1877).\n\nIn the latter years of the 19th century, precursors of the modern picture book were illustrated books of poems and short stories produced by English illustrators Randolph Caldecott, Walter Crane, and Kate Greenaway. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in colour. Some British artists made their living illustrating novels and children's books; among them were Arthur Rackham, Cicely Mary Barker, W. Heath Robinson, Henry J. Ford, John Leech, and George Cruikshank.\n\nThe Kailyard school of Scottish writers, notably J. M. Barrie, creator of \"Peter Pan\" (1904), presented an idealised version of society and brought fantasy and folklore back into fashion. In 1908, Kenneth Grahame wrote the children's classic \"The Wind in the Willows\" and the Scouts founder Robert Baden-Powell's first book \"Scouting for Boys\" was published. Inspiration for Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel \"The Secret Garden\" (1910) was the Great Maytham Hall Garden in Kent. In 1920 Hugh Lofting created the character Doctor Dolittle who appears in a series of twelve books.\n\nThe Golden Age of Children's Literature ended with World War I in Great Britain and Europe, and the period before World War II was much slower in children's publishing. The main exceptions in England were the publications of \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" by A. A. Milne in 1926, the first \"Mary Poppins\" book by P. L. Travers in 1934, \"The Hobbit\" by J. R. R. Tolkien in 1937, and the Arthurian novel \"The Sword in the Stone\" by T. H. White in 1938.\n\nChildren's paperback books were first released in England in 1940 under the Puffin Books imprint, and their lower prices helped make book buying possible for children during World War II.\n\nEnid Blyton's books have been among the world's best-sellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies. Blyton's books are still enormously popular, and have been translated into almost 90 languages. She wrote on a wide range of topics including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her Noddy, The Famous Five, The Secret Seven, and The Adventure Series. The first of these children's stories, \"Five on a Treasure Island\", was published in 1942.\n\nIn the 1950s, the book market in Europe began recovering from the effects of two world wars. An informal literary discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the \"Inklings\". Its leading members were the major fantasy novelists; C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. C. S. Lewis published the first installment of \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" series in 1950 while Tolkien is best known in addition to \"The Hobbit\" as the author of \"The Lord of the Rings\". (1954) Another significant writer of fantasy stories is Alan Garner author of \"Elidor\" (1965), and \"The Owl Service\" (1967). The latter work is an adaptation of the myth of Blodeuwedd from the \"Mabinogion\", set in modern Wales, and for it Garner won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British author.\n\nMary Norton wrote \"The Borrowers\" (1952), featuring tiny people who borrow from humans. Dodie Smith's \"The Hundred and One Dalmatians\" was published in 1956. Philippa Pearce's \"Tom's Midnight Garden\" (1958) has him opening the garden door at night and entering into a different age. The heroine of \"Charlotte Sometimes\" by Penelope Farmer (1969) is already shaken by her arrival in a girls' boarding school when she finds herself waking as another girl in the same bed, but decades earlier. Closer to reality, Jenny in \"No One Must Know\" (1962) by Barbara Sleigh is a newcomer in the street who faces a landlord's pet ban. She needs urgent help from nearby children to hide her cat and kittens.\n\nRoald Dahl rose to prominence with his children's fantasy novels, often inspired from experiences from his childhood, with often unexpected endings, and unsentimental, dark humour. Dahl was inspired to write \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (1964), featuring the eccentric candymaker Willy Wonka, having grown up near two chocolate makers in England who often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies into the other's factory. His other works include \"James and the Giant Peach\" (1961), \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" (1971), \"The Witches\" (1983), and \"Matilda\" (1988). Starting in 1958, Michael Bond published humorous stories about Paddington Bear.\n\nBoarding schools in literature are centred on older pre-adolescent and adolescent school life, and are most commonly set in English boarding schools. Popular school stories from this period include Ronald Searle's \"St Trinian's\" (1949–53) and his illustrations for Geoffrey Willans's \"Molesworth\" series, Jill Murphy's \"The Worst Witch\" and the \"Jennings\" series by Anthony Buckeridge.\n\nRuth Manning-Sanders collected and retold fairy tales, and her first work \"A Book of Giants\" contains a number of famous giants, notably \"Jack and the Beanstalk\". Susan Cooper's \"The Dark Is Rising\" is a five-volume fantasy saga set in England and Wales. Raymond Briggs' children's picture book \"The Snowman\" (1978) has been adapted as an animation, shown every Christmas on British television, and for the stage as a musical. The Reverend. W. Awdry and son Christopher's \"The Railway Series\" features \"Thomas the Tank Engine\". Margery Sharp's series \"The Rescuers\" is based on a heroic mouse organisation. The third Children's Laureate Michael Morpurgo published \"War Horse\" in 1982. The prolific children's author Dick King-Smith's novels include \"The Sheep-Pig\" (1984), and \"The Water Horse\". Diana Wynne Jones wrote the young adult fantasy novel \"Howl's Moving Castle\" in 1986. Anthony Horowitz's \"Alex Rider\" series begins with \"Stormbreaker\" (2000). Cressida Cowell's \"How to Train Your Dragon\" series were published between 2003 and 2015.\n\nJ. K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" fantasy series is a sequence of seven novels that chronicle the adventures of the adolescent wizard Harry Potter. The series began with \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" in 1997 and ended with the seventh and final book \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" in 2007; becoming the best selling book-series in history. The series has been translated into 67 languages, placing Rowling among the most translated authors in history.\n\nAdventure stories written specifically for children began in the 19th century. Early examples include Johann David Wyss' \"The Swiss Family Robinson\" (1812), Frederick Marryat's \"The Children of the New Forest\" (1847) and Harriet Martineau's \"The Peasant and the Prince\" (1856).\n\nThe Victorian era saw the development of the genre, with W.H.G. Kingston, R. M. Ballantyne and G. A. Henty specializing in the production of adventure fiction for boys. This inspired writers who normally catered to adult audiences to write for children, and an example is Robert Louis Stevenson's (1850–94) classic pirate story \"Treasure Island\" (1883).\n\nIn the years after the First World War, writers such as Arthur Ransome (1884–1967) developed the adventure genre by setting the adventure in Britain rather than distant countries. Ransome began publishing in 1930 his Swallows and Amazons series of children's books about the school-holiday adventures of children, mostly in the English Lake District and the Norfolk Broads. Many of the books involve sailing; fishing and camping are other common subjects. Biggles was a popular series of adventure books for young boys, about James Bigglesworth, a fictional pilot and adventurer, by W. E. Johns. Biggles made his first appearance in the story \"The White Fokker\", published in the first issue of \"Popular Flying\" magazine and again as part of the first collection of Biggles stories, \"The Camels Are Coming\" (both 1932). Johns continued to write Biggles books until his death in 1968, the series eventually spanning nearly a hundred volumes – including novels and short story collections – most of the latter with a common setting and time. These included novels about a woman pilot in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), Flight Officer Joan Worralson, better known as \"Worrals\".\n\nGeoffrey Trease and Rosemary Sutcliff brought a new sophistication to the historical adventure novel. Philip Pullman in the Sally Lockhart novels and Julia Golding in the Cat Royal series have continued the tradition of the historical adventure.\n\nAn important aspect of British children's literature has been comic books and magazines. Amongst the most popular comics have been \"The Dandy\" and \"The Beano\". Important early magazines or story papers for older children were the \"Boys Own Paper\", which was published from 1879 to 1967 and \"The Girl's Own Paper\" published from 1880 until 1956. Other story papers for older boys were \"The Hotspur\" (1933 to 1959) and \"The Rover\"–which started in 1922 and was absorbed into \"Adventure\" in 1961 and \"The Wizard\" in 1963, and eventually folded in 1973.\n\nMany prominent authors contributed to the \"Boys Own Paper\": cricketer W.G. Grace wrote for several issues, along with authors Arthur Conan Doyle, Jules Verne and R.M. Ballantyne, as well as Robert Baden-Powell, the inspiration for the Scout Movement, Between 1941–61 there was 60 issues with stories about Biggles by W. E. Johns, and in the 1960s occasional contributors included Isaac Asimov and the respected astronomer Patrick Moore.\n\nMany contributors to \"The Girls Own Paper\" were not known outside the paper's pages but they also included Noel Streatfeild, Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd, Rosa Nouchette Carey, Sarah Doudney (1841–1926), Angela Brazil, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Richmal Crompton, Fanny Fern, and Baroness Orczy. Between 1940–47 Captain W. E. Johns contributed sixty stories featuring the female pilot Worrals.\n\nThe \"Eagle\" was a popular British comic for boys, launched in 1950 by Marcus Morris, an Anglican vicar from Lancashire. Revolutionary in its presentation and content, it was enormously successful; the first issue sold about 900,000 copies. Featured in colour on the front cover was its most recognisable story, \"Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future\", created with meticulous attention to detail. Other popular stories included \"Riders of the Range\" and \"P.C. 49\". \"Eagle\" also contained news and sport sections, and educational cutaway diagrams of sophisticated machinery. A members club was created, and a range of related merchandise was licensed for sale. It was first published from 1950 to 1969, and relaunched from 1982 to 1994.\n\nChildren's literature has been a part of American culture since Europeans first settled in America. The earliest books were used as tools to instill self-control in children and preach a life of morality in Puritan society. 18th-century American youth began to shift away from the social upbringing of its European counterpart, bringing about a change in children's literature. It was in this time that \"A Little Book for Little Children\" was written by T.W. in 1712. It includes what is thought to be the earliest nursery rhyme and one of the earliest examples of a text book approaching education from the child's point of view, rather than the adult's.\n\nOne of the most famous books of American children's literature is L. Frank Baum's fantasy novel \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", published in 1900. \"By combining the English fondness for word play with the American appetite for outdoor adventure\", Connie Epstein in \"International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature\" says Baum \"developed an original style and form that stands alone\". Baum wrote fourteen more Oz novels, and other writers continued the Oz series into the twenty-first century.\n\nDemand continued to grow in North America between World War I and World War II, helped by the growth of libraries in both Canada and the United States. Children's reading rooms in libraries, staffed by specially trained librarians, helped create demand for classic juvenile books. Reviews of children's releases began appearing regularly in \"Publishers Weekly\" and in \"The Bookman\" magazine began to regularly publish reviews of children's releases, and the first Children's Book Week was launched in 1919. In that same year, Louise Seaman Bechtel became the first person to head a juvenile book publishing department in the country. She was followed by May Massee in 1922, and Alice Dalgliesh in 1934.\n\nThe American Library Association began awarding the Newbery Medal, the first children's book award, in 1922. The Caldecott Medal for illustration followed in 1938. The first book by Laura Ingalls Wilder about her life on the American frontier, \"Little House in the Big Woods\" appeared in 1932. In 1937 Dr. Seuss published his first book, entitled, \"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street\". The young adult book market developed during this period, thanks to sports books by popular writer John R. Tunis', the novel \"Seventeenth Summer\" by Maureen Daly, and the \"Sue Barton\" nurse book series by Helen Dore Boylston.\n\nThe already vigorous growth in children's books became a boom in the 1950s, and children's publishing became big business. In 1952, American journalist E. B. White published \"Charlotte's Web\", which was described as \"one of the very few books for young children that face, squarely, the subject of death\". Maurice Sendak illustrated more than two dozen books during the decade, which established him as an innovator in book illustration. The Sputnik crisis that began in 1957, provided increased interest and government money for schools and libraries to buy science and math books and the non-fiction book market \"seemed to materialize overnight\".\n\nThe 1960s saw an age of new realism in children's books emerge. Given the atmosphere of social revolution in 1960s America, authors and illustrators began to break previously established taboos in children's literature. Controversial subjects dealing with alcoholism, death, divorce, and child abuse were now being published in stories for children. Maurice Sendak's \"Where the Wild Things Are\" in 1963 and Louise Fitzhugh's \"Harriet the Spy\" in 1964 are often considered the first stories published in this new age of realism.\n\nEsther Forbes in \"Johnny Tremain\" (1943) and Mildred D. Taylor in \"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\" (1976) continued the tradition of the historical adventure in an American setting. The modern children's adventure novel sometimes deals with controversial issues like terrorism, as in Robert Cormier's \"After the First Death\" in 1979, and warfare in the Third World, as in Peter Dickinson's \"AK\" in 1990.\n\nIn books for a younger age group, Bill Martin and John Archambault's \"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\" (1979) presented a new spin on the alphabet book. Laura Numeroff published \"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\" in 1985 and went on to create a series of similarly named books that is still popular for children and adults to read together.\n\nLloyd Alexander's The Chronicles of Prydain (1964-1968) was set in a fictionalized version of medieval Britain.\n\nThe period from 1890 until World War I is considered the Golden Age of Children's Literature in Scandinavia. Erik Werenskiold, Theodor Kittelsen, and Dikken Zwilgmeyer were especially popular, writing folk and fairy tales as well as realistic fiction. The 1859 translation into English by George Webbe Dasent helped increase the stories' influence. One of the most influential and internationally most successful Scandinavian children's books from this period is Selma Lagerlöfs \"The Wonderful Adventures of Nils\". Astrid Lindgren (\"Pippi Longstocking\") and Jostein Gaarder (\"Sophie's World\") are two of the best-known Scandinavian writers internationally.\n\nThe interwar period saw a slow-down in output similar to Britain, although \"one of the first mysteries written specifically for children,\" \"Emil and the Detectives\" by Erich Kästner, was published in Germany in 1930. German writers Michael Ende (\"The Neverending Story\") and Cornelia Funke (\"Inkheart\") achieved international success with their fantasy books.\n\nThe period during and following World War II became the Classical Age of the picture book in Switzerland, with works by Alois Carigiet, Felix Hoffmann, and Hans Fischer. 1963 was the first year of the Bologna Children's Book Fair in Italy, which was described as \"the most important international event dedicated to the children's publishing\". For four days it brings together writers, illustrators, publishers, and book buyers from around the world.\n\nSwiss author Marcus Pfister's \"Rainbow Fish\" series has received international acclaim since 1992.\n\nRussian folktales were collected by Aleksandr Afanasyev in his three volume \"Narodnye russkie skazki\", and a selection of these were published in \"Русские детские сказки\" (Russian Children's Fairy Tales) in 1871. By the 1860s, literary realism and non-fiction dominated children's literature. More schools were started, using books by writers like Konstantin Ushinsky and Leo Tolstoy, whose \"Russian Reader\" included an assortment of stories, fairy tales, and fables. Books written specifically for girls developed in the 1870s and 1880s. Publisher and journalist Evgenia Tur wrote about the daughters of well-to-do landowners, while Alexandra Nikitichna Annenskaya's stories told of middle-class girls working to support themselves. Vera Zhelikhovsky, Elizaveta Kondrashova, and Nadezhda Lukhmanova also wrote for girls during this period.\n\nChildren's non-fiction gained great importance in Russia at the beginning of the century. A ten-volume children's encyclopedia was published between 1913 and 1914. Vasily Avenarius wrote fictionalized biographies of important people like Nikolai Gogol and Alexander Pushkin around the same time, and scientists wrote for books and magazines for children. Children's magazines flourished, and by the end of the century there were 61. Lidia Charskaya and continued the popularity of girls' fiction. Realism took a gloomy turn by frequently showing the maltreatment of children from lower classes. The most popular boys' material was Sherlock Holmes, and similar stories from detective magazines.\n\nThe state took control of children's literature during the October Revolution. Maksim Gorky edited the first children's, \"Northern Lights\", under Soviet rule. People often label the 1920s as the Golden Age of Children's Literature in Russia. Samuil Marshak led that literary decade as the \"founder of (Soviet) children's literature\". As head of the children's section of the State Publishing House and editor of several children's magazines, Marshak exercised enormous influence by recruiting Boris Pasternak and Osip Mandelstam to write for children.\n\nIn 1932, professional writers in the Soviet Union formed the USSR Union of Writers, which served as the writer's organization of the Communist Party. With a children's branch, the official oversight of the professional organization brought children's writers under the control of the state and the police. Communist principles like collectivism and solidarity became important themes in children's literature. Authors wrote biographies about revolutionaries like Lenin and Pavlik Morozov. Alexander Belyayev, who wrote in the 1920s and 1930s, became Russia's first science fiction writer. According to Ben Hellman in the \"International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature\", \"war was to occupy a prominent place in juvenile reading, partly compensating for the lack of adventure stories\", during the Soviet Period. More political changes in Russia after World War II brought further change in children's literature. Today, the field is in a state of flux because some older authors are being rediscovered and others are being abandoned.\n\nIn Brazil, Monteiro Lobato wrote a series of 23 books for children known as Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (The Yellow Woodpecker Ranch), between 1920 and 1940. The series is considered representative of Brazilian children's literature and the Brazilian equivalent to children's classics such as C. S. Lewis, The Chronicles of Narnia and L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz series. The concept was introduced in Monteiro Lobato's 1920 short story \"A Menina do Narizinho Arrebitado\", and was later republished as the first chapter of \"Reinações de Narizinho\", which is the first novel of the series. The main setting is the \"Sítio do Picapau Amarelo\", where a boy (Pedrinho), a girl (Narizinho) and their living and thinking anthropomorphic toys enjoy exploring adventures in fantasy, discovery and learning. On several occasions, they leave the ranch to explore other worlds such as Neverland, the mythological Ancient Greece, an underwater world known as \"Reino das Águas Claras\" (Clear Waters Kingdom), and even the outer space. The \"Sítio\" is often symbolized by the character of Emília, Lobato's most famous creation.\n\nChristian missionaries first established the Calcutta School-Book Society in the 19th century, creating a separate genre for children's literature in that country. Magazines and books for children in native languages soon appeared. In the latter half of the century, Raja Shivprasad wrote several well-known books in Hindustani. A number of respected Bengali writers began producing Bengali literature for children including Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, who translated some stories and wrote others himself. Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore wrote plays, stories, and poems for children, including one work illustrated by painter Nandalal Bose. They worked from the end of the 19th century into the beginning of the 20th century. Tagore's work was later translated into English, with Bose's pictures. Behari Lal Puri was the earliest writer for children in Punjabi. His stories were didactic in nature.\n\nThe first full-length children's book was \"Khar Khar Mahadev\" by Narain Dixit, which was serialized in one of the popular children's magazines in 1957. Other writers include Premchand, and poet Sohan Lal Dwivedi. In 1919, Sukumar Ray wrote and illustrated nonsense rhymes in the Bengali language, and children's writer and artist Abanindranath Tagore finished \"Barngtarbratn\". Bengali children's literature flourished in the later part of the twentieth century. Educator Gijubhai Badheka published over 200 books in the Children's literature in Gujarati language, and many of them are still popular. Other popular Gujarati children's authors were Ramanlal Soni and Jivram Joshi. In 1957, political cartoonist K. Shankar Pillai founded the Children's Book Trust publishing company. The firm became known for high quality children's books, and many of them were released in several languages. One of the most distinguished writers is Pandit Krushna Chandra Kar in Oriya literature, who wrote many good books for children, including \"Pari Raija\", \"Kuhuka Raija\", \"Panchatantra\", and \"Adi Jugara Galpa Mala\". He wrote biographies of many historical personalities, such as \"Kapila Deva\". In 1978, the firm organized a writers' competition to encourage quality children's writing. The following year, the Children's Book Trust began a writing workshop and organized the First International Children's Book Fair in New Delhi. Children's magazines, available in many languages, were widespread throughout India during this century.\n\nOne of the pioneering children's writer in Persian was Mehdi Azar-Yazdi. His award-winning work, \"Good Stories for Good Children\", is a collection of stories derived from the stories in Classical Persian literature re-written for children.\n\nOriginally, for centuries, stories were told by Africans in their native languages, many being told during social gatherings. Stories varied between mythic narratives dealing with creation and basic proverbs showcasing human wisdom. These narratives were passed down from generation to generation orally. Since its Independence in 1960, Nigeria has witnessed a rise in the production of children's literature by its people, the past three decades contributing the most to the genre. Most children's books depict the African culture and lifestyle, and trace their roots to traditional folktales, riddles, and proverbs. Authors who have produced such works include Chinua Achebe, Cyprian Ekwensi, Amos Tutuola, Flora Nwapa, and Buchi Emecheta. Publishing companies also aided in the development of children's literature.\n\nChildren's literature can be divided into categories, either according to genre or the intended age of the reader.\nA literary genre is a category of literary compositions. Genres may be determined by technique, tone, content, or length. According to Anderson, there are six categories of children's literature (with some significant subgenres):\n\nThe criteria for these divisions are vague, and books near a borderline may be classified either way. Books for younger children tend to be written in simple language, use large print, and have many illustrations. Books for older children use increasingly complex language, normal print, and fewer (if any) illustrations. The categories with an age range are listed below:\n\nPictures have always accompanied children's stories. A papyrus from Byzantine Egypt, shows illustrations accompanied by the story of Hercules' labors. Modern children's books are illustrated in a way that is rarely seen in adult literature, except in graphic novels. Generally, artwork plays a greater role in books intended for younger readers (especially pre-literate children). Children's picture books often serve as an accessible source of high quality art for young children. Even after children learn to read well enough to enjoy a story without illustrations, they continue to appreciate the occasional drawings found in chapter books.\n\nAccording to Joyce Whalley in \"The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature\", \"an illustrated book differs from a book with illustrations in that a good illustrated book is one where the pictures enhance or add depth to the text.\" Using this definition, the first illustrated children's book is considered to be \"Orbis Pictus\" which was published in 1658 by the Moravian author Comenius. Acting as a kind of encyclopedia,\"Orbis Pictus\" had a picture on every page, followed by the name of the object in Latin and German. It was translated into English in 1659 and was used in homes and schools around Europe and Great Britain for years.\n\nEarly children's books, such as \"Orbis Pictus\", were illustrated by woodcut, and many times the same image was repeated in a number of books regardless of how appropriate the illustration was for the story. Newer processes, including copper and steel engraving were first used in the 1830s. One of the first uses of Chromolithography (a way of making multi-colored prints) in a children's book was demonstrated in \"Struwwelpeter\", published in Germany in 1845. English illustrator Walter Crane refined its use in children's books in the late 19th century. \n\nAnother method of creating illustrations for children's books was etching, used by George Cruikshank in the 1850s. By the 1860s, top artists were illustrating for children, including Crane, Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway, and John Tenniel. Most pictures were still black-and-white, and many color pictures were hand colored, often by children. \"The Essential Guide to Children's Books and Their Creators\" credits Caldecott with \"The concept of extending the meaning of text beyond literal visualization\".\n\nTwentieth-century artists such as Kay Nielson, Edmund Dulac, and Arthur Rackham produced illustrations that are still reprinted today. Developments in printing capabilities were reflected in children's books. After World War II, offset lithography became more refined, and painter-style illustrations, such as Brian Wildsmith's were common by the 1950s.\n\nProfessional organizations, dedicated publications, individual researchers and university courses conduct scholarship on children's literature. Scholarship in children's literature is primarily conducted in three different disciplinary fields: literary studies/cultural studies (literature and language departments and humanities), library and information science, and education. (Wolf, et al., 2011).\n\nTypically, children's literature scholars from literature departments in universities (English, German, Spanish, etc. departments), cultural studies, or in the humanities conduct literary analysis of books. This literary criticism may focus on an author, a thematic or topical concern, genre, period, or literary device and may address issues from a variety of critical stances (poststructural, postcolonial, New Criticism, psychoanalytic, new historicism, etc.). Results of this type of research are typically published as books or as articles in scholarly journals.\n\nThe field of Library and Information Science has a long history of conducting research related to children's literature.\n\nMost educational researchers studying children's literature explore issues related to the use of children's literature in classroom settings. They may also study topics such as home use, children's out-of-school reading, or parents' use of children's books. Teachers typically use children's literature to augment classroom instruction.\n\nControversies often emerge around the content and characters of prominent children’s books. Well-known classics that remain popular throughout decades commonly become criticized by critics and readers as the values of contemporary culture change. Critical analysis of children’s literature is common through children's literary journals as well as published collections of essays contributed to by psychoanalysts, scholars and various literary critics such as Peter Hunt.\n\nPopular classics such as \"The Secret Garden\", \"Pippi Longstocking\", \"Peter Pan\", \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" and \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" have been criticized for their racial stereotyping.\n\nThe academic journal \"Children’s Literature Review\" provides critical analysis of many well known children’s books. In its 114th volume, the journal discuses the cultural stereotypes in Belgian cartoonist Herge’s \"Tintin\" series in reference to its depiction of people from the Congo.\n\nAfter the scramble for Africa which occurred between the years of 1881 and 1914 there was a large production of children's literature which attempted to create an illusion of what life was like for those who lived on the African continent. This was a simple technique in deceiving those who only relied on stories and secondary resources. Resulting in a new age of books which put a “gloss” on imperialism and its teachings at the time. Thus encouraging the idea that the colonies who were part of the African continent were perceived as animals, savages and un human like. Therefor needing cultured higher class Europeans to share their knowledge and resources with the locals. Also promoting the idea that the people within these places were as exotic as the locations themselves.  Examples of these books include:\n\n\n\"The Five Chinese Brothers\", written by Claire Huchet Bishop and illustrated by Kurt Wiese has been criticized for its stereotypical caricatures of Chinese people. Helen Bannerman’s \"The Story of Little Black Sambo\" and Florence Kate Upton’s \"The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg\" have also been noted for their racist and controversial depictions. The term \"sambo\", a racial slur from the American South caused a widespread banning of Bannerman's book. Author Julius Lester and illustrator Jerry Pinkney revised the story as \"Sam and the Tigers: A New Telling of Little Black Sambo\", making its content more appropriate and empowering for ethnic minority children. Feminist theologian Dr. Eske Wollrad claimed Astrid Lindgren's \"Pippi Longstocking\" novels \"have colonial racist stereotypes\", urging parents to skip specific offensive passages when reading to their children. Criticisms of the 1911 novel \"The Secret Garden\" by author Frances Hodgson Burnett claim endorsement of racist attitudes toward black people through the dialogue of main character Mary Lennox. Hugh Lofting's The Story of Doctor Dolittle has been accused of \"white racial superiority\", by implying through its underlying message that an ethnic minority person is less than human.\n\nThe picture book \"The Snowy Day\", written and illustrated by Ezra Jack Keats was published in 1962 and is known as the first picture book to portray an African-American child as a protagonist. Middle Eastern and Central American protagonists still remain underrepresented in North American picture books. According to the Cooperative Children's Books Center (CCBC) at University of Wisconsin Madison, which has been keeping statistics on children's books since the 1980s, in 2016, out of 3,400 children's books received by the CCBC that year, only 278 were about Africans or African Americans. Additionally, only 92 of the books were written by Africans or African Americans. In his interview in the book \"Ways of Telling: Conversations on the Art of the Picture Book\", Jerry Pinkney mentioned how difficult it was to find children's books with black children as characters. In the literary journal \"The Black Scholar\", Bettye I. Latimer has criticized popular children’s books for their renditions of people as almost exclusively white, and notes that \"Dr. Seuss\" books contain few ethnic minority people. The popular school readers \"Fun with Dick and Jane\" which ran from the 1930s until the 1970s, are known for their whitewashed renditions of the North American nuclear family as well as their highly gendered stereotypes. The first black family didn't appear in the series until the 1960s, thirty years into its run.\n\nWriter Mary Renck Jalongo In \"Young Children and Picture Books\" discusses damaging stereotypes of Native Americans in children's literature, stating repeated depictions of indigenous people as living in the 1800s with feathers and face paint cause children to mistake them as fictional and not as people that still exist today. The depictions of Native American people in Laura Ingalls Wilder’s \"Little House on the Prairie\" and J.M. Barrie’s \"Peter Pan\" are widely discussed among critics. Wilder’s novel, based on her childhood in America’s midwest in the late 1800s, portrays Native Americans as racialized stereotypes and has been banned in some classrooms. In her essay, \"Somewhere Outside the Forest: Ecological Ambivalence in Neverland from The Little White Bird to Hook\", writer M. Lynn Byrd describes how the natives of Neverland in \"Peter Pan\" are depicted as \"uncivilized,\" valiant fighters unafraid of death and are referred to as \"redskins\", which is now considered a racial slur.\n\nThe presence of empire as well as pro-colonialist and imperialist themes in children’s literature have been identified in some of the most well known children’s classics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nIn the French illustrator Jean de Brunhoff’s 1931 picture book \"Histoire de Babar, le petit elephant (The Story of Babar, The Little Elephant)\", prominent themes of imperialism and colonialism have been noted and identified as propaganda. An allegory for French colonialism, Babar easily assimilates himself into the bourgeois lifestyle. It is a world where the elephants who have adapted themselves dominate the animals who have not yet been assimilated into the new and powerful civilization. H. A. Rey and Margret Rey’s \"Curious George\" first published in 1941 has been criticized for its blatant slave and colonialist narratives. Critics claim the man with the yellow hat represents a colonialist poacher of European descent who kidnaps George, a monkey from Africa, and sends him on a ship to America. Details such as the man in colonialist uniform and Curious George's lack of tail are points in this argument. In an article, \"The Wall Street Journal\" interprets it as a \"barely disguised slave narrative.\" Rudyard Kipling, the author of \"Just So Stories\" and \"The Jungle Book\" has also been accused of colonial prejudice attitudes. Literary critic Jean Webb, among others, has pointed out the presence of British imperialist ideas in \"The Secret Garden\". Colonialist ideology has been identified as a prominent element in Peter Pan by critics.\n\nSome of the earliest children’s stories that contain feminist themes are Louisa May Alcott’s \"Little Women\" and Frank L. Baum’s \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". With many women of this period being represented in children’s books as doing housework, these two books deviated from this pattern. Drawing attention to the perception of housework as oppressive is one of the earliest forms of the feminist movement. \"Little Women\", a story about four sisters, is said to show power of women in the home and is seen as both conservative and radical in nature. The character of Jo is observed as having a rather contemporary personality and has even been seen as a representation of the feminist movement. It has been suggested that the feminist themes in \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" result from influence of Baum's mother-in law, Matilda Gage, an important figure in the suffragist movement. Baum's significant political commentary on capitalism, and racial oppression are also said to be part of Gage's influence. Examples made of these themes is the main protagonist, Dorothy who is punished by being made to do housework. Another example made of positive representations of women is in Finnish author Tove Jansson's Moomin series which features strong and individualized female characters. In recent years, there has been a surge in the production and availability of feminist children's literature as well as a rise in gender neutrality in children's literature.\n\nIn addition to perpetuating stereotypes about appropriate behavior and occupations for women and girls, children's books frequently lack female characters entirely, or include them only as minor or unimportant characters. In the book \"Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics\", scholar Alison Lurie says most adventure novels of the 20th century, with few exceptions, contain boy protagonists while female characters in books such as those by Dr. Seuss, would typically be assigned the gender-specific roles of receptionists and nurses. The \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" characters written by A. A. Milne, are primarily male, with the exception of the character Kanga, who is a mother to Roo. Even animals and inanimate objects are usually identified as being male in children's books. The near-absence of significant female characters is paradoxical because of the role of women in creating children's literature.\n\nOn the one hand \"Growing up with Dick and Jane\" highlights the heterosexual, nuclear family and also points out the gender-specific duties of the mother, father, brother and sister, while \"Young Children and Picture Books\", on the other hand, encourages readers to avoid books with women who are portrayed as inactive and unsuccessful as well as intellectually inferior and subservient to their fellow male characters to avoid children’s books that have repressive and sexist stereotypes for women.\n\nIn her book \"Children’s Literature: From the fin de siècle to the new millennium\", professor Kimberley Reynolds claims gender division stayed in children's books prominently until the 1990s. She also says that capitalism encourages gender-specific marketing of books and toys. For example, adventure stories have been identified as being for boys and domestic fiction intended for girls. Publishers often believe that boys will not read stories about girls, but that girls will read stories about both boys and girls; therefore, a story that features male characters is expected to sell better. The interest in appealing to boys is also seen in the Caldecott awards, which tend to be presented to books that are believed to appeal to boys. Reynolds also says that both boys and girls have been presented by limited representations of appropriate behaviour, identities and careers through the illustrations and text of children’s literature. She argues girls have traditionally been marketed books that prepare them for domestic jobs and motherhood. Conversely, boys are prepared for leadership roles and war. During the 20th century, more than 5,000 children's picture books were published in the U.S; during that time, male characters outnumbered female characters by more than 3 to 2, and male animals outnumbered female animals by 3 to 1. No children's picture book that featured a protagonist with an identifiable gender contained only female characters.\n\n\"I’m Glad I’m a Boy! I’m Glad I’m a Girl!\" (1970) by Whitney Darrow Jr. was criticized for its narrow depictions of careers for both boys and girls. The book informs the reader that boys are doctors, policemen, pilots, and Presidents while girls are nurses, meter maids, stewardesses and First Ladies.\n\nIn his article, entitled “Gender Equality: A Case Study of Janaki Sooriyarachichi’s Picture Book \"The Flying Train\",” Dr. Mehdi Ghasemi draws attention to the ways Janaki Sooriyarachchi – the writer and illustrator of \"The Flying Train\" – validates feminine and masculine voices and visions and balances gender issues both in the story book's narratives and illustrations.\n\nA widely discussed and debated topic by critics and publishers in the children’s book industry is whether outdated and offensive content, specifically racial stereotypes, should be changed upon the printing of new editions. Some question if certain books should be banned while others believe original content should remain but publishers should make additions that guide parents in conversations with their children about the problematic elements of the particular story. Some see racist stereotypes as cultural artifacts that should be preserved. In \"The Children’s Culture Reader\", scholar Henry Jenkins references Herbert Kohl’s essay \"Should We Burn Babar?\" which raises the debate whether children should be educated on how to think critically towards oppressive ideologies rather than ignore historical mistakes. Jenkins suggests that parents and educators should trust children to make responsible judgments.\n\nSome books have been altered in newer editions and significant changes can be seen, such as illustrator Richard Scarry’s book \"Best Word Book Ever\". and Roald Dahl’s book \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\". In other cases classics have been rewritten into updated versions by new authors and illustrators. Several versions of \"Little Black Sambo\" have been remade as more appropriate and without prejudice.\n\nBruno Bettelheim in \"The Uses of Enchantment\", uses psychoanalysis to examine the impact that fairy tales have on the developing child. Bettelheim states the unconscious mind of a child is affected by the ideas behind a story, which shape their perception and guides their development. Likewise, author and illustrator Anthony Browne contends the early viewing of an image in a picture book leaves an important and lasting impression on a child. According to research, a child’s most crucial individual characteristics are developed in their first five years. Their environment and interaction with images in picture books have a profound impact on this development and are intended to inform a child about the world.\n\nChildren’s literature critic Peter Hunt argues that no book is innocent of harbouring an ideology of the culture it comes from. Critics discuss how an author’s ethnicity, gender and social class inform their work. Scholar Kimberley Reynolds suggests books can never be neutral as their nature is intended as instructional and by using its language, children are imbedded with the values of that society. Claiming childhood as a culturally constructed concept, Reynolds states that it is through children’s literature that a child learns how to behave and to act as a child should, according to the expectations of their culture. She also attributes capitalism, in certain societies, as a prominent means of instructing especially middle class children in how to behave. The \"image of childhood\" is said to be created and perpetuated by adults to affect children \"at their most susceptible age\". Kate Greenaway’s illustrations are used as an example of imagery intended to instruct a child in the proper way to look and behave. In Roberta Seelinger Trites's book \"Disturbing the Universe: Power and Repression in Adolescent Literature\", she also argues adolescence is a social construct established by ideologies present in literature. In the study \"The First R: How Children Learn About Race and Racism\", researcher Debra Ausdale studies children in multi-ethnic daycare centres. Ausdale claims children as young as three have already entered into and begun experimenting with the race ideologies of the adult world. She asserts racist attitudes are assimilated using interactions children have with books as an example of how children internalize what they encounter in real life.\n\nMany noted awards for children's literature exist in various countries:\n\nInternational awards also exist as forms of global recognition. These include the Hans Christian Andersen Award, the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award, Ilustrarte Bienale for illustration, and the BolognaRagazzi Award for art work and design. Additionally, bloggers with expertise on children's and young adult books give a major series of online book awards called The Cybils Awards, or, Children's and Young Adult Bloggers' Literary Awards.\n\n\n"}

It covers a variety of topics in English literature, and also includes some pioneering studies of popular culture. It was acclaimed by critics, and Orwell himself thought it one of his most important books.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn late 1944 Orwell, worrying about the ephemerality of magazine publication, began to collect a volume of his best essays. The resulting collection appeared under the imprint of Secker & Warburg on 14 February 1946, with a print-run of 3028 copies. The following May a second impression of 5632 copies was issued, with some small corrections. The US edition of 5000 copies was published in April 1946 by Reynal & Hitchcock, and retitled \"Dickens, Dali & Others: Studies in Popular Culture\". A reprint in paperback dropped the subtitle.\n\nThe blurb to the first edition described some of the essays as being \"among the very few attempts that have been made in England to study popular art seriously\". Orwell thought seemingly frivolous popular culture, such as crime fiction, comic postcards, and the Billy Bunter stories, to be worth studying for the light it throws on contemporary attitudes. Applying this approach to the subjects considered in \"Critical Essays\" he tended to find that they showed the innovations of his own time to be harsh and unfeeling compared to the old-fashioned humanity of traditional popular forms.\nAnother theme is that of literary style, which Orwell thought to be the inevitable result of its writer's world-view and the message he wanted to get across. He considered the English language of the 1940s to be in a degenerate state, and held that political discourse was inevitably corrupted as a result.\n\nOrwell himself, writing before he had completed \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", said that he thought \"Critical Essays\" one of his three most important books, along with \"Animal Farm\" and \"Homage to Catalonia\". His contemporaries in the world of criticism also largely saw the book's merits. The journalist Tosco Fyvel, writing in \"Tribune\", acclaimed Orwell as \"a national figure as a critic, satirist and political journalist\", while disagreeing with Orwell's view that the Attlee government was uncommitted to the introduction a fully socialist society. In the Catholic paper \"The Tablet\" Evelyn Waugh predictably deplored Orwell's lack of religious feeling, but also wrote that the essays \"represent at its best the new humanism of the common man\", and that Orwell was \"outstandingly the wisest\" of the new critics. Middleton Murry, who likewise criticised Orwell's secularism, nevertheless called Orwell and Cyril Connolly the two most gifted critics of their generation. V. S. Pritchett considered the essays \"brilliant examples of political anthropology applied to literature by a non-conforming mind\". Eric Bentley saw the book as \"a dirge for nineteenth-century liberalism\", and, like Irving Howe, thought it represented Orwell at his best. Edmund Wilson, a critic to whom most others compared Orwell, called him \"the only contemporary master\" of sociological criticism, praising him for his courage in rejecting the reigning orthodoxies, and for \"a prose style that is both downright and disciplined\". A recent survey of Orwell's work endorses his own high opinion of its importance, calling it \"Orwell at his best\", a book which \"showed Orwell's talent for finding deep meaning in otherwise trivial matters\", while Bernard Crick said that Orwell's essays \"may well constitute his lasting claim to greatness as a writer\".\n\n"}
{"id": "27001744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27001744", "title": "Digimon Fusion", "text": "Digimon Fusion\n\nDigimon Fusion, known in Japan as , is the sixth anime television series of the \"Digimon\" franchise, produced by Toei Animation. It follows the adventures of Michael \"Mikey\" Kudo, who utilizes the power of fusing any Digimon partners. The series was broadcast on TV Asahi and Asahi Broadcasting Corporation between July 6, 2010 and March 21, 2012. It is divided into three arcs with the latter two given the subtitles of , and respectively. The series was licensed outside of Asia by Saban Brands for an English dub produced by Studiopolis. The first arc was dubbed as the first season of \"Digimon Fusion\". The second arc premiered on March 8, 2015. The series was adapted into a manga series and for multiple video games. The use of deeper themes and striking fight scenes have earned a positive response from critics, despite the series intended for young viewers.\n\nMichael \"Mikey\" Kudo is a 7th grade boy with a need to help others. Mikey hears a mysterious voice and finds a dying Digimon named Shoutmon in a nearby alley. Mikey's desire to save Shoutmon causes a mysterious legendary Digivice called the Fusion Loader to appear in front of him and drags him and his friends Angie Hinomoto and Jeremy Tsurgi into the Digital World. Mikey, Angie, and Jeremy find there is a growing evil empire ruled by Bagramon. Bagramon is systematically taking over the 108 Zones of the Digital World by collecting the Code Crown fragments, which are parts of a special artifact that, when completely collected, allow the holder to rule the Digital World. Mikey decides to save the Digital World. Mikey forms his own team known as the Fusion Fighters. The Fusion Fighters befriend various Digimon. Mikey uses his Fusion Loader to DigiFuse the Digimon from the Fusion Fighter team to battle Bagramon's Bagra Army legions and collect all the Code Crown fragments. On his journey, the Fusion Fighter team encounters two other generals. The two other generals are Christopher Aonuma and his Blue Flare team and Nene Amano with her Midnight team. Nene is later revealed as a figurehead for Midnight's true leader: SkullKnightmon who blackmailed her in aiding him in creating the Darkness Loader. After SkullKnightmon attempts to dispose of her once she outlived her usefulness, Nene joins the Fusion Fighters.\n\nThe Fusion Fighters continued to collect the Code Crown fragments, slowly restoring peace and order to the Digital World. But when a final confrontation for a fully formed Code Crown begins, Bagramon takes it while sending Mikey, Angie, and Jeremy back to the human world along with Shoutmon and Bagra Army general Tactimon. With the Fusion Fighters' core members out of the way, Bagramon begins his reign alongside SkullKnightmon, who is revealed as his younger brother. Ending up in their hometown of Koto, the Fusion Fighters meet Omnimon who is an ancient warrior sealed in a DigiCard. Omnimon is the one who gave Mikey his Fusion Loader. An enlarged Tactimon fully bioemerges and causes havoc until the feelings of Angie and Jeremy enable Shoutmon to Digivolve into OmniShoutmon to destroy Tactimon for good. Omnimon used his remaining energy to send Mikey and Shoutmon back to the Digital World, while Angie and Jeremy remain in the human world.\n\nUpon returning to the Digital World, Mikey and Shoutmon find that Bagramon has reconstructed the Digital World into an empire divided into seven kingdoms. Each kingdom is ruled by a denominated Dark General with their own Darkness Loaders that have the ability to forcibly DigiFuse Digimon gained from the Bagra Army's new second in command SkullKnightmon. Reunited with their allies, Mikey and Nene convince Christopher to join forces with them. Mikey, Christopher, and Nene travel together through the seven kingdoms to defeat the seven Dark Generals, learning that Nene's kid brother Ewan Amano is helping the Bagra Army after SkullKnightmon had tricked the boy into thinking the Digital World is a game for his pleasure. In time, the Fusion Fighters learn that Bagramon uses the seven Dark Generals to gather negative energy from the suffering they caused to transform the Code Crown into the \"Dark Stone\" for his upcoming day for ultimate destruction, which he calls \"D5.\" During the journey, Christopher, Nene and Ewan's pasts and motivations are revealed. Some Digimon are killed in battle, allies are made, and stronger DigiFusions are created to better combat the seven Dark Generals. After defeating the seven Dark Generals while opening Ewan's eyes to the truth, the Fusion Fighters finally confront Bagramon. Bagramon reveals his intentions to combine the human and digital worlds with himself as the supreme ruler.\n\nBagramon's plans are temporarily disrupted when AxeKnightmon (SkullKnightmon's fusion with the Digimon named Axemon) forcibly absorbs him to gain more power in the form of Darkest AxeKnightmon. But Bagramon overpowers his brother while converting the DigiFusion into DarknessBagramon. In the process, Shoutmon dies while DarknessBagramon sends Mikey, Christopher, and Nene to a void. But Mikey, Christopher, and Nene are saved by Angie and Jeremy using the last two DigiMemory Cards. In the final battle, Ewan's Darkness Loader turned into a yellow Fusion Loader for his use. Mikey, Angie, and Cutemon decide to go inside the Dark Stone to find Shoutmon. Mikey, Angie, and Cutemon are attacked by the metaphysical incarnation of Bagramon. When the completed Code Crown chose Mikey as its true owner, Shoutmon is revived alongside all the dead Digimon: Including fallen allies (Beelzemon & Deckerdramon) and former enemies (Grademon, Apollomon and Olegmon). The Digimon trapped in the DigiMemory Cards also regain their original forms. The Digimon are all DigiFused into Shoutmon X7 Superior Mode, who destroys MegaDarknessBagramon (a gigantic version of DarknessBagramon after he absorbed parts of his surroundings to increase his size). The Fusion Fighters and Shoutmon X7 Superior Mode save both the human and digital worlds, the human members remaining in the human world as they say farewell to all their Digimon friends as they return to their world to rebuild it under their new Digimon King Shoutmon.\n\nA year has passed since the battle against MegaDarknessBagramon. Mikey established the Xros Heart basketball team consisting of himself, Ewan, and his classmate named Tagiru Akashi. One day, Tagiru discovers a strange and unstable realm in-between the human and digital worlds called the DigiQuartz. The DigiQuartz is where Fusion Loader wielding children known as Digimon Hunters hunt down and capture Digimon that escape from the Digital World to feed off the negative emotions of humans. Given a Fusion Loader by a strange old man and accompanied by a Digimon named Gumdramon, Tagiru, along with Mikey, Ewan and their Digimon, join the Digimon Hunt to investigate and protect their world from rampant Digimon while clashing against rival hunters. In the end, the Clock Store Owner reveals to everyone the truth that the Digimon Hunt was to select one among the Digimon Hunters to battle Quartzmon. Quartzmon is a deadly Digimon born from the residual power that lingered after MegaDarknessBagramon's defeat with the combined Digital Power in the human world that intends to change the entire human world into the DigiQuartz while absorbing all converted data.\n\nTo fight the threat, the Clock Store Owner traveled through time and space to summon the eight original Digidestined, the four new Digidestined, the Digimon Tamers, the Legendary Digimon Warriors, and the operatives of DATS from their different universes to fend off Quartzmon alongside the reunited Fusion Fighter Army. Taigiru and the other Digimon Hunters battle each other to unlock the \"Brave Snatcher,\" which is a weapon created from Bagramon's right arm that can defeat Quartzmon. Though a Hunter named Ryouma wins the Brave Snatcher, he is revealed as a tool by Quartzmon in the form of his partner Astamon. With the blessing of Mikey and the other group leaders, Tagiru is chosen as Ryouma's replacement. In a decisive battle, Tagiru uses the power of the Brave Snatcher to defeat Quartzmon and capture his DigiEgg. With Quartzmon defeated, the balance between the Human and Digital Worlds is restored, with the Digimon returning to the Digital World while the heroes are sent back to their universes. A month after Quartzmon's defeat, Tagiru and Gumdramon are reunited. The Clock Store Owner reappears, who reveals that there are still some Digimon running astray in the Human World. In the occasion, Mikey confirms his suspicion that the Clock Store Owner is actually the reincarnation of Bagramon, who has now dedicated himself to protect the human and Digital Worlds.\n\n\"Digimon Xros Wars\" was first publicly revealed in the June 2010 issue of Shueisha's \"V Jump\" magazine, including the name of the series and brief descriptions of the series and several main characters. It was directed by Tetsuya Endo and written by Riku Sanjo. \"Digimon Fusion\" received positive ratings in Japan. However, the third season was rushed, with Yukio Kaizawa as the main writer. In order to retain the series' popularity, Mikey Kudo remained as a returning character, while Christopher and Nene were removed from the main cast. Instead, Ewan remained as a protagonist due to his character still needing growth. The series was the first to be broadcast in widescreen and in HD 1080i and aired on TV Asahi between July 6, 2010, and March 25, 2012. Crunchyroll began streaming the original Japanese version of the series outside of Japan, with English subtitles, in November 2011. Disney XD in Malaysia aired a William Winckler-produced English version along with original Chinese and Malay dubs based on the original Japanese version from December 8, 2012, titled \"Digimon Fusion Battles\".\n\nThe series was licensed by Saban Brands for an English language release to air in North America, contracting Studiopolis to dub the series into English and hiring Noam Kaniel (who worked on \"X-Men\", & \"Power Rangers\",) to compose the music for the series. The series began airing on Nickelodeon on September 7, 2013, was moved to Nicktoons after three episodes, and later began airing on The CW's Vortexx programming block from January 25, 2014 to September 27, 2014. The first season became available for streaming on Netflix starting September 13, 2014, while the second season became available on March 8, 2016. In Latin America, the series began being broadcast on Cartoon Network in May 1, 2014. Beginning on February 24, 2014, \"Fusion\" began airing in the United Kingdom on CITV, the same channel that aired the first three seasons. In Canada, YTV, which aired previous installments of the franchise (barring \"Digimon Data Squad\"), began airing the series on February 28, 2014, with thirty episodes.\n\nThe series was released on DVD with nineteen volumes by Bandai Visual in Japan from April 22, 2011 to August 24, 2012. A DVD box was released on November 22, 2016. \"Part I\" was released in the US on February 10, 2015 via Cinedigm, in Germany on June 15, 2015, and in the UK in via ITV Studios Home Entertainment. In Australia, \"Part I\" was released in several volumes from June 11, 2014.\"Part II\" was released in the US on March 1, 2016 via Cinedigm.\n\nKousuke Yamashita composed the music for the series. A total of three CD soundtracks under the label of \"Music Code\" were released in Japan on September 29, 2010, March 23, 2011 and January 18, 2012.\n\n\n\n\nA manga adaptation of the series by Yuki Nakashima began serialisation in Shueisha's \"V-Jump\" magazine from June 21, 2010, featuring several major plot differences from the anime. The manga consists of twenty-one chapters in four volumes. The last one was released on March 21, 2012.\n\nTwo arcade machines, and , have been released, which utilise special cards. A video game based on the series, , was released in Red and Blue versions for the Nintendo DS on March 3, 2011. Together, \"Super Xros Wars\" serves as the fourth game in the \"Digimon Story\" series. Bandai released a series of card games in North America.\n\nOn its Japanese premiere, \"Digimon Fusion\" had a rating of 4.1 viewers. \"Digimon Xros Wars: The Boy Hunters Who Leapt Through Time\" was nominated for the 2012 International Emmy Kids Awards for \"Best Animation\". \"Famicom Tsūshin\" scored \"Digimon Story: Super Xros Wars\" 32 out of 40. Early responses by Anime News Network praised the pilot, stating nostalgic \"Digimon\" fans would enjoy it based on its new approach to power-ups within the main cast and compared it to the highly acclaimed mecha series \"Gurren Lagann\" despite suffering from cliches often seen in other anime. Voice actor Kyle Hebert said he enjoyed working in the English dub of the series as his two characters, Dorulumon and Balistamon, offered diverse characterization. Fellow actor Ben Diskin shared similar feelings, commenting he had been a fan of \"Fusion\" ever since its Japanese premiere and thus was glad to be voicing both Shoutmon and Cutemon, another pair of characters whose personalities differ greatly. \n\nGeneral critical reception has also been positive. Mediaverum enjoyed the early episodes from \"Fusion\" and recommended it to fans of both the first two \"Digimon Adventure\" series. While noting the series was aimed at a young audience, DVDCorner wrote that the series still had deep themes which might attract older viewers despite its flaws. ICv2 recommended the series for a young audience when checking the English DVDs. CulturedVultures left it up to the viewers to watch it or not, also recommending it to an audience that has knowldege of the franchise, while Metro stated it retained the appeal of its predecessors which overshadowed the famous \"Pokémon\" back in the 1990s. DVDTalk found mixed feelings when reviewing \"Fusion\". While he lamented the series' focus on Digimons rather than humans, he still praised the show for its animation and recommended it to fans of the series. Capsule Monster commented that despite the apparent attempts of the series to expand marketing, \"Fusion\" offers an appealing story, as rather than focusing on friendship, it also contains dark themes rarely seen in children's shows which might attract other audiences.\n\n\n\n"}

It governs how citizens should dress in public and how they should behave in formal settings. It also regulates a number of cultural assets such as art and architecture. In English, \"driglam\" means \"order, discipline, custom, rules, regimen\" and \"namzha\" means \"system\", though the term may be styled \"The Rules for Disciplined Behaviour\".\n\nThe Driglam Namzha traces its roots directly back to the 17th-century pronouncements of Ngawang Namgyal, the first Zhabdrung Rinpoche, a Tibetan lama and military leader who sought to unify Bhutan not only politically but also culturally. He established guidelines for dzong architecture, the characteristic monastery-fortresses of Bhutan. He also established many of the traditions of the tshechu \"district festival\" such as the Cham dance. The guidelines were intentionally codified to encourage the emergence of a distinctively-Bhutanese identity.\n\nIn 1989, the government elevated the status of the dress code from recommended to mandatory. All citizens were then required to observe the dress code in public during business hours. The decree was resented by Lhotshampas in the southern lowlands, who complained about being forced to wear the clothing of the Ngalop people.\n\nUnder the Driglam Namzha, men wear a heavy knee-length robe tied with a belt, called a gho, which is folded in such a way to form a pocket in front of the stomach. Women wear colourful blouses called wonju over which they fold and clasp a large rectangular cloth called a kira, thereby creating an ankle-length dress. A short silk jacket or toego may be worn over the kira. Everyday gho and kira are cotton or wool according to the season, patterned in simple checks and stripes in earth tones. For special occasions and festivals, colourfully-patterned silk kira and, more rarely, gho, may be worn.\n\nAdditional rules apply when visiting a dzong or a temple, and when appearing before a high-level official. A white, raw silk sash with fringes called a kabney is worn by commoner men from left shoulder to opposite hip, with other colours reserved for officials and monks. Women wear a \"rachu\", a narrow embroidered cloth draped over the left shoulder.\n\nThe Driglam Namzha codifies the traditional rules for the construction of the sacred fortresses known as dzongs. No plans are drawn up nor are nails allowed in their construction. Under the direction of an inspired lama, citizens build dzongs as part of their tax obligation to the state. As recently as 1998, by decree, all buildings must be constructed with multi-coloured wood frontages, small arched windows and sloping roofs.\n\n"}

It is the successor to the 2012 video game \"Far Cry 3\", and the fourth main installment in the \"Far Cry\" series. The game was released on November 18, 2014.\n\nThe game takes place in Kyrat, a fictional Himalayan country. The main story follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American, as he is caught in a civil war involving Kyrat's Royal Army, controlled by tyrannical king Pagan Min, and a rebel movement called the Golden Path. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players battle enemy soldiers and dangerous wildlife using a wide array of weapons. The game features many elements found in role-playing games, such as a branching storyline, and side quests. The game also features a map editor, a co-operative multiplayer mode, and an asymmetrical competitive multiplayer mode.\n\nAnnounced in May 2014, development on \"Far Cry 4\" began immediately after the shipment of \"Assassin's Creed III\" in late 2012. The team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to \"Far Cry 3\" that continues \"3\"'s story, but the idea was later scrapped and the team decided to develop a new setting and new story for the game. Certain aspects of \"Far Cry 4\" were inspired by the Nepalese Civil War, and the costume of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films \"Ichi the Killer\" and \"Brother\". The game's competitive multiplayer was created by Red Storm Entertainment while the Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by Ubisoft Toronto.\n\n\"Far Cry 4\" was met with a mostly positive critical reception upon release. Critics praised the open world design, visuals, soundtrack, and characters, particularly antagonist Pagan Min, as well as new gameplay additions and the wealth of content. However, some critics disliked the story and found the game too similar to its predecessor. The game was a commercial success, selling seven million copies by the end of 2014, and was the biggest launch in the franchise's history. Several releases of downloadable content were subsequently published. A successor, \"Far Cry 5\", was released on March 27, 2018.\n\n\"Far Cry 4\" is a first-person action-adventure game. Players assume control of Ajay Ghale, a Kyrati-American who is on a quest to spread his deceased mother's ashes in the fictional country of Kyrat. Throughout the game, players can run, leap, and crouch, and have the ability to use weapons including shotguns, crossbows, sniper rifles, mines, throwing knives, bows, flamethrowers, and rocket launchers. The game allows players to take cover to avoid gunfights and to perform melee takedowns from above or up-close. Unlike previous installments in the series, \"Far Cry 4\" gives players the ability to kick objects and the ability to hide the corpses of enemies. \n\nPlayers can use a variety of methods to approach missions. For instance, players can utilize stealth to evade enemies and complete objectives without being noticed, or they also have the option to assault enemies with firearms and vehicles. The player-character is equipped with a digital camera, which allows him to mark and highlight all visible enemies, animals, and loots. Players are also able to ride on elephants, which serve as tank-like offensive weapons. Players can throw bait towards enemies, which attracts nearby wildlife that is hostile to both the player and enemies. Players can also hunt and skin animals.\n\nThe game features an open world environment that is free for players to explore. It features several environments, including forests, rivers, and mountains. To allow players to travel between places faster, the game features various vehicles, including buggies, trucks, and water vehicles like speedboats. Players can drive and shoot at the same time, and can enable auto-drive, in which the game's artificial intelligence takes over the role of controlling the vehicle and guides players to their objectives. Players can also hijack other vehicles while driving. The Buzzer, an aerial, helicopter-like vehicle, is introduced in the game, allowing players to gain a tactical advantage from the air. Parachutes, wingsuits, and grappling hooks are also featured in the game; these items help players swing across cliffs and quickly navigate the environment. Parts of the game take place in Shangri-La, a mystical dreamland where players battle demons as the Kyrati warrior Kalinag. While in Shangri-La, players are accompanied by an injured tiger which serves as their companion. Players can issue commands to the tiger, which assists them in battle.\n\nThe game world is divided into two halves: North and South Kyrat. Players start in South Kyrat and are free to explore it almost immediately, but can only unlock North Kyrat over the course of the story. The map is progressively opened by liberating bell towers, freeing them from Pagan Min's influence and allowing the Golden Path to expand. These towers help players reveal new areas and mark new locations of interest on the map. The world is scattered with outposts controlled by Pagan Min, which can be infiltrated by players. Four larger outposts, or fortresses, can also be found, and feature stronger defenses and more difficult combinations of enemies. If players successfully liberate these outposts, they will serve as fast-travel points, allowing quick navigation through the game's world. Additional missions and quests also become available. There are many side-missions that can be completed, including hostage rescues, bomb disposal quests, and hunting missions. The collected animals' parts can then be used for crafting new pouches and belts.\n\nLike its predecessors, the game features some role-playing elements. Players can earn experience points by completing missions and defeating enemies, and these experience points can then be spent on performance boosts and upgrades. There are two sets of abilities for players to choose from, called The Tiger and The Elephant. The Tiger upgrades mainly improve players' offensive abilities, while The Elephant upgrades improve players' defensive skills. A variety of random events and hostile encounters take place throughout the game; for example, the player may unexpectedly be attacked by an eagle, be hit by a car, or witness an animal attack. Players can accumulate karma by performing kind actions towards the rebels, such as by assisting them in battles when they are attacked by wildlife or enemies. Doing so will give players discounts when purchasing new items at trading posts, and will allow players to call in support and back-up from members of the Golden Path. Players can also gain experience by collecting items like masks, propaganda posters, and prayer wheels. There is also an Arena mode, in which players battle human enemies and animals for additional experience points and rewards.\n\n\"Far Cry 4\" features a co-operative multiplayer mode known as \"Guns for Hire\", which supports up to two players. The mode is separated from the game's campaign, and players are free to explore the game's world, defeat enemies, and infiltrate outposts with their companion. In addition to the co-operative mode, players can gain access to several competitive multiplayer modes which have an asymmetrical structure. Players play as either a Rakshasa or a Golden Path member. The Rakshasa are equipped with bows and arrows, and have the ability to teleport and to summon wildlife to assist them, while Golden Path members are equipped with guns and explosives, and have access to armored vehicles. Known as \"Battles of Kyrat\", players fight against each other in three modes, called Outpost, Propaganda, and Demon Mask. \"Far Cry 4\" also contains a Map Editor that allows users to create and share custom content. Similar to that of \"Far Cry 3\", players can create their maps by customizing landscapes, and by placing buildings, trees, wildlife, and vehicles. However, the Map Editor did not support competitive multiplayer levels at launch. Multiplayer support was added to the game on February 3, 2015.\n\nThe story was inspired by the ten-year-long Maoist insurgency in Nepal. The game follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American who returns to his native country of Kyrat (a fictional Himalayan country derived from the Kirat ethnicities of Nepal and northern India) to spread his deceased mother's ashes. Kyrat was once an autonomous state in the Himalayas ruled by a royal family before being engulfed in a series of civil wars. Ajay finds the country in a state of conflict between Kyrat's Royal Army, led by the country's eccentric and tyrannical King Pagan Min, and the Golden Path, a rebel movement fighting to free Kyrat from Min's oppressive rule. The choices Ajay makes will determine the fate of Kyrat.\n\nAfter the death of his mother Ishwari, Ajay Ghale (James A. Woods) returns to his home country of Kyrat to carry out Ishwari's final wish by returning her ashes to Lakshmana. However, his mission is interrupted when the bus he is traveling on is attacked by the Royal Army and he is taken prisoner by Pagan Min (Troy Baker), the country's eccentric and violent king, who claims to have been romantically involved with Ishwari. After finding his way through Pagan's mansion, Ajay escapes with the aid of Sabal (Naveen Andrews), a commander in the Golden Path, a rebel movement established by Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale. Ajay is not able to leave the country as the Royal Army has taken control of Kyrat's only airport and sealed the borders.\nIn the twenty-odd years since Ishwari and Ajay fled Kyrat, the rebellion has stagnated, with the Golden Path now fighting for their very existence. As the son of Mohan Ghale, Ajay becomes a symbol for the Golden Path to rally around. After freeing a group of hostages and liberating territory held by Pagan, the Golden Path plan on breaking Pagan's stranglehold on power by targeting his three regional governors: Paul \"De Pleur\" Harmon (Travis Willingham), who oversees opium production and runs Pagan's torture chambers; Noore Najjar (Mylène Dinh-Robic), who runs poaching and prostitution rings and who became a victim of Pagan's cruelty herself after he kidnapped her family; and Yuma Lau (Gwendoline Yeo), Min's adopted sister and trusted general who is obsessed with uncovering the secrets of the mystical realm of Shangri-La.\n\nHowever the Golden Path's newfound momentum is threatened by deep divisions between its commanders, Sabal, who favors traditional values, and Amita (Janina Gavankar), who argues for progress, which includes relying heavily on drug trade. Ajay is forced to intervene on several occasions, with his decisions influencing the direction the Golden Path takes. The first governor to fall is De Pleur after Noore helps Ajay find a way to infiltrate De Pleur's stronghold, allowing the rebellion to capture him. Amita and Sabal later task Ajay with confronting and killing Noore. She dies in her fighting arena, either with Ajay killing her, or with Noore committing suicide upon learning Pagan had her family executed years beforehand.\n\nAs the Golden Path secures Kyrat's southern provinces, Ajay is contacted by Willis Huntley (Alain Goulem), a CIA agent who offers intelligence for the rebels and pages from his father's diary in exchange for killing Yuma's lieutenants. After Ajay kills several of them, Huntley admits they were in fact CIA assets, and that he was sent to clean up after the CIA as the agency did not see Pagan as a threat anymore. Huntley betrays Ajay to Pagan just as the Golden Path prepare to push into Northern Kyrat.\n\nAjay ends up in Yuma's mountain prison, from which he manages to escape. In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because of his affections toward Ajay's late mother. The Golden Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the Golden Path. Whichever leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other to prevent them from starting another civil war, and Ajay can choose to either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the Golden Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.\n\nAjay encounters Pagan, who chastises him for fleeing at the start of the game, claiming that he only ever intended to help Ajay. Pagan offers Ajay a final decision: shoot him now, or listen to him. If Ajay shoots Pagan, the game ends immediately and the credits roll. If Ajay instead chooses to listen, Pagan reveals that Mohan sent Ishwari to spy on Pagan in the early days of the Golden Path, but they fell in love and had a daughter together: Lakshmana, Ajay's half-sister. Mohan killed Lakshmana for Ishwari's betrayal, and Ishwari killed him in turn before leaving the country with the infant Ajay. Pagan shows Ajay to a shrine containing Lakshmana's ashes, and Ajay places Ishwari's ashes inside. Pagan then boards a helicopter and departs peacefully, leaving the country in Ajay's hands. The player can choose to shoot down Pagan's helicopter as it flies away, killing Pagan in the process.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Golden Path seizes control of Kyrat. The final ending depends on which leader Ajay ultimately sided with. If Amita is placed in charge, she turns Kyrat into an authoritarian drug state, forcing villagers into work in factories and drug fields, and conscripting children into the group as soldiers to bolster their ranks against the remnants of the Royal Army; Ajay also learns that she has had her sister, Bhadra, taken away, \"never to come again\". If Sabal is placed in charge, Kyrat becomes a religious fundamentalist theocracy where all of Amita's supporters are executed, with Bhadra anointed as a religious symbol for the country to rally around. The player has the choice to kill the Golden Path's leader or leave them alive.\n\nAn Easter egg ending can be found at the beginning of the game. To trigger it, Ajay must simply wait at the dinner table in Pagan's mansion; when Pagan returns, he thanks Ajay during the ensuing conversation for being a \"gentleman\", and leads him to Lakshmana's shrine, telling Ajay of his family history before he plants his mother's ashes at the shrine. After Ajay exits the shrine, Pagan invites Ajay to join him to \"finally shoot some goddamn guns\".\n\n\"Escape from Durgesh Prison\" is an additional chapter of the story available as downloadable content. It expands upon Ajay's escape from the Durgesh prison and return to the Golden Path, and on Yuma's planned insurrection against Pagan Min.\n\nFollowing Ajay's escape, he is left stranded in the snow at high altitude where he is rescued by Pagan Min. After tending to Ajay's wounds, Min leaves him in a tower in Northern Kyrat, as he is unable to return Ajay to the Golden Path directly. He then leaks news of Ajay's escape to Sabal and Amita, and allows them to secure a Royal Army helicopter so that they can extract him. However, word of this has spread to Yuma, who marshals the forces loyal to her and plans to attack the landing site once Ajay tries to escape. Because of this, Ajay only has a limited window of opportunity to escape, but can buy more time by attacking Yuma's forces. In exchange for disrupting Yuma's plans for a coup, Min promises Ajay support and resources at the landing site. During his missions, Ajay overhears one of the guards of Yuma saying that she was sent to a valley in the northern mountains of Kyrat on an expedition after something of great power called \"The Relic\". After killing Yuma's lieutenants, disrupting her supply lines, and thwarting her plans to sabotage Min's communications, Ajay ventures to the landing site where he is forced to fight off Yuma's attack long enough for the helicopter to power up. With the landing site secured and Yuma's forces in disarray, Ajay is successfully airlifted out contacts Sabal and Amita saying that he was heading to the valley to learn what is behind the expedition and the Relic.\n\n\"Valley of the Yetis\" is a downloadable additional chapter of content which takes place directly after \"Escape from Durgesh Prison\".\n\nIn his way to the Lost Valley to learn more about the expedition Yuma sent after the Relic, Ajay's helicopter is shot down by an unknown assailant. Ajay survives the crash, but awakens to discover that the pilot has been abducted and taken deeper into the valley. Ajay follows him intent on rescue, only to discover that the valley is occupied by an aggressive army. Liberating a relay station in a bid to re-establish contact with the Golden Path, he is forced to fight off wave after wave of attackers whilst being taunted by a voice over the radio. Investigating further, Ajay discovers the army is calling themselves the Disciples of Yalung, and is a cult worshiping a demon from Kyrati mythology. The Disciples have harnessed an evil that permeates the valley to transform their followers into \"Awakened\", or yetis, and are amassing their forces to attack Kyrat. Realizing that he cannot return to Kyrat without dealing with the cult, Ajay gradually destroys their ranks before scaling a glacier to find the source of Yalung's influence. After successfully destroying a tree that provides the Disciples with their power, Ajay sees himself as an Awakened, although this is supposedly just a hallucination.\n\nThe game's development was led by Ubisoft Montreal, which took over the development of the \"Far Cry\" franchise after the release of \"\" in 2005. Additional development was handled by four other in-house Ubisoft studios, Ubisoft Toronto, Red Storm Entertainment, Ubisoft Shanghai, and Ubisoft Kiev. The Montreal studio worked on the game's campaign, the Toronto studio worked on the Shangri-La segments of the campaign, Red Storm handled the development of the competitive multiplayer, the Shanghai studio worked on the hunting missions, and the Kiev studio developed the game's PC version. Development of the game began in late 2012, after the shipment of \"Assassin's Creed III\". The game's creative director is Alex Hutchinson, who had previously worked on Maxis's \"Spore\" as well as \"Assassin's Creed III\".\n\nWhen brainstorming ideas for the new \"Far Cry\" game, the development team originally planned on developing a direct sequel to \"Far Cry 3.\" The sequel would be set on the same tropical island, would expand upon the protagonist's story, and would bring back characters, such as \"Far Cry 3\"'s secondary antagonist, Vaas. However, after four days, the team found that a sequel was not what they wanted to achieve. As a result, they decided to scrap the idea and build a brand new game with a new setting and a new set of characters. The team adapted a \"we want it all\" approach, in which they hoped to experiment with all kinds of ideas. Some team members hoped that the game would allow players to fly, which led to the game's verticality. The game's director also hoped that players would be able to ride a rampaging elephant, in a place with \"exotic mountainsides\" and \"unique culture\". This led to the concept of a mountainous setting and the introduction of elephants in the game. The developers aimed for players to consider \"Far Cry 4\" a standalone experience, and therefore they avoided bringing back any characters from \"Far Cry 3\" except for Willis and Hurk The decision to bring the two back was made because the team thought that they should provide some references to previous games in the series, as all of the games are set in the same universe even though they are not directly related.\n\nSome of the gameplay elements were directly taken from \"Far Cry 3\". Exotic locations, hunting, and the freedom for players to complete missions through different approaches were maintained in \"Far Cry 4\". The team hoped that by incorporating and expanding upon on these ideas, while introducing new features, they could make \"Far Cry 4\" an evolution for the series. As a result, the size of the game's outposts became larger and players were given more options to customize their weapons. The team also realized that players spent a lot of time interacting with the open world of \"Far Cry 3\", and decided to put more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.\n\nThe game's setting, Kyrat, is a fictional country in the Himalayas region. When building Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including Nepal and Tibet, but exaggerated those elements. The map's size is similar to that of \"Far Cry 3\", but is more dense, diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains. The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identity for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also designed to accommodate new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In an effort to make the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead of simply being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world. In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the local culture, so that they could bring those ideas back to the studio. According to the developer, the trip changed the game's design; the focus shifted from the game's civil war, which is inspired by the real-world Nepalese Civil War, to developing unique and interesting characters.\n\nOne of the game's most critically acclaimed characters is Pagan Min, the game's major antagonist. The team hoped that players would be \"shocked, amazed and intrigued\" by him in every encounter. Min has a complex relationship with the playable character, Ghale, as the team wanted players to guess Min's intentions and add a layer of mystery to him. The team originally hoped to have a villain that had a \"punk-rock mentality\", but the idea was abandoned as the team thought that the concept was not original. The pink costume Min wears throughout the game was inspired by Beat Takeshi, a character from \"Brothers\", and Ichi, a character from \"Ichi the Killer\". Min is designed to be sadistic yet confident, and the team hired Troy Baker to provide the voice for Min, as they thought that Baker's voice is charismatic enough to suit Min. According to Baker, Ubisoft gave him a script for the audition but he chose not to follow it, and instead decided to threaten to cut off the face of an assistant using Min's tone. The interviewer was very pleased with Baker's performance and decided to sign him for the job. As for Ghale, he was designed to be \"thin\", and his backstory was designed to be revealed as players progressed through the game's story. According to the game's narrative director, Mark Thompson, Ghale learns the history and culture of Kyrat along with players. The developers also hoped that Ghale could be an accessible character for players.\n\nIn hindsight, the team considered the story of \"Far Cry 3\" \"great\", even though they thought that it was separated from the game's world. In order to increase players' agency and make the story to feel more connected to the world for players, the team introduced a branching storyline which required players to make choices that would lead to different results and alter the game's ending. The team hoped that by adding choices, they could add additional depth and meaning to the game's campaign. Thompson added that they twisted the story of \"Far Cry 3\" for \"Far Cry 4\", and made outsiders the villains instead of the heroes. The team considered it a \"risk\", but they wanted to try something different.\nFor the Shangri-La mission, the team wanted to have a structure similar to \"3\"'s mushroom missions; a game within a game. The Shangri-La missions are not related to Kyrat, but play an important role in the game's narrative. When creating these segments, the team put a lot of emphasis on the use of colors. They hoped that the artistic vision for \"Far Cry 4\" would not feature any resemblance to other typical shooter games. It was originally designed to be a small open world, but was later converted into a linear experience due to time constraints and huge creative differences between developers. The team later decided to simplify it, and re-imagined it into an \"ancient, natural world\". It is made up of five different colors. The main color of Shangri-La is gold; the developers thought that using gold as the foundation added \"warmth\" to the dreamland. Meanwhile, red was used heavily to add a sense of strangeness, as well as for establishing a tie to the game's narrative and story. Orange was used as a color of interaction, while white was used to add purity to the world. Blue is the last of Shangri-La's main colors, and represents dangers and honor.\n\nUbisoft promised that \"Far Cry 4\" would have much more of a multiplayer element than \"Far Cry 3\". Some elements that were scrapped for \"Far Cry 3\" due to time constraints were featured in \"Far Cry 4\", such as the \"Guns for Hire\" co-operative multiplayer mode. Building a co-operative experience was the team's goal starting from the beginning of the game's development. Originally intended to be a separate mode, it was later made to be seamlessly integrated into the main campaign. The game's competitive multiplayer was designed to give players freedom, allowing players to progress and defeat enemies through a variety of different ways. Red Storm Entertainment also considered players' feedback from the multiplayer aspect of \"Far Cry 3\", and decided to include vehicles to the game. The company chose an asymmetrical structure for the match, so that players could have different experiences in different matches, as well as to make matches feel more chaotic. The developers originally planned to feature female playable characters, but the plan was scrapped due to animation problems. Ubisoft announced a 'Keys to Kyrat' offer for players that owned a copy of the game for the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4. It allows those owners to send out game keys to up to ten other people who do not own a copy of the game. Players who are offered a key can join the person that sent them the key and play the co-operative mode for two hours.\n\nCliff Martinez was hired to work on the game's soundtrack. A two disc edition was released that contained 30 tracks heard in the game, and a deluxe edition was released that contained 15 extra tracks. The album was released just before the release of the game, and received positive reviews. Particular praise was directed towards the usage of traditional Nepalese instruments which, combined with electronic samples, suggested high octane action and mystical wondering.\n\nWith \"Far Cry 3\" being a commercial success, Ubisoft considered the \"Far Cry\" series one of their most important brands, and they hinted that a sequel was in development in June 2013. On October 3, 2013, Martinez mentioned that he was working on the soundtrack for the game. In March 2014 the game's setting and features were leaked. The game was officially announced on May 15, 2014, and the first gameplay footage was revealed during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014. The game's cover art, which shows the light-skinned Pagan Min resting his hand on a dark-skinned person, caused controversy and accusation of racism. Hutchinson later responded and clarified by saying that Pagan Min is not a white person, and that the other person depicted is not the game's protagonist. Hutchinson added that the reaction of the community regarding the cover art was \"uncomfortable\".\n\nIn addition to the standard version, a \"Limited Edition\" of the game could be purchased. This edition features additional in-game missions and an Impaler Harpoon Gun. The Limited Edition was a free upgrade for players who pre-ordered the game. A \"Kyrat Edition\" was also announced and it contains a collector's box, a poster, a journal, a map of Kyrat, a figurine of Pagan Min, and the missions from the Limited Edition. Players can also purchase a season pass for the game, which grants them access to additional content, including a new competitive multiplayer mode, a mission called \"the Syringe\", the missions from the \"Limited Edition\", and the two other pieces of downloadable content. \"Far Cry 4: Arena Master\", developed by Ludomade, was released alongside the game itself, as a companion app for the iOS and Android.\n\n\"Far Cry 4\" was released worldwide on November 18, 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. The PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC versions feature higher visual fidelity, such as having a higher texture resolution and more animal fur. The game was supported by downloadable content upon launch. The first DLC, \"Escape From Durgesh Prison\", featuring a new mission set during the main campaign, was released on January 13, 2015. It can be played solo or with another player. The \"Overrun\" DLC, which added new maps, a new vehicle, and a new mode to the game's competitive multiplayer, was released on February 10, 2015 for the consoles, and February 12, 2015 for PC. The \"Hurk Deluxe Pack\" was released on January 28, 2015 and added several story missions and weapons. The last downloadable content, \"Valley of the Yetis\", features a new region and new story missions which can be played solo or co-cooperatively with another player. \"Valley of the Yetis\" was released on March 10, 2015 in North America and March 11, 2015 in Europe.\n\n\"Far Cry 4\" received a positive reception upon release. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Xbox One version 85.92% based on 12 reviews and 82/100 based on 14 reviews, respectively. The PlayStation 4 version received 83.76% based on 57 reviews on GameRankings and 85/100 based on 83 reviews on Metacritic, and the Microsoft Windows version received 81.00% based on 9 reviews and 80/100 based on 17 reviews, respectively.\n\nThe game's story received mixed responses. Chris Carter from Destructoid praised the personality of Ajay Ghale, which is \"less in-your-face\" than that of \"Far Cry 3\"'s protagonist Jason Brody. He also praised the villain, Pagan Min, who he considered took the spotlight every time he appeared in the game. Josh Harmon from \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" thought that the characters in this game had more depth, and that the choices made by players throughout the game were meaningful. Aoife Wilson from Eurogamer thought that the game's characters were memorable, but was disappointed by the story. Nick Tan, from Game Revolution, also praised Min's personality, but he complained that the character appeared too seldom in the game. Edwin Evans-Thirlwell, writing for GamesRadar, thought that the story grew tiresome as players progressed, even though some of its characters were interesting. He further criticized the game's writing, which he thought was lackluster. Mike Splechta from \"GameZone\" praised the game's voice acting and applauded its storyline, calling it satisfying.\n\nThe game's setting received positive responses. Carter thought that the verticality nature of the game's map created obstacles for players when they were traveling between places. However, he praised the interesting lore and wildlife found within the world, as well as the game's long draw distance. Harmon had similar comments, praising the game's graphics and Kyrat's culture. Harmon thought that the hilly landscape of the game's world gave players a sense of exploration, and hence made traversal enjoyable. Wilson thought, however, that the game's setting was not as compelling as the tropical setting of \"Far Cry 3\". Nevertheless, she praised the Shangri-la section, which she thought had changed the game's landscape drastically. Matt Bertz from \"Game Informer\" praised the game's setting, which he thought was vibrant, varied and rich. Ludwig Kietzmann from Joystiq praised the content found within the world, and thought that the world itself was absorbing and interesting.\n\nThe game's design also received acclaim. Carter from Destructoid thought that the fortress and the outpost system provided players with a sense of accomplishment and success, and he considered having the freedom to use different ways to approach and complete missions one of the greatest parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series. However he criticized the upgrade system, which he thought was directly converted from \"Far Cry 3\" and was uninspiring. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"'s Harmon thought that the introduction of the helicopter was dull. Mitch Dyer, from IGN, praised the game's economy system, which he thought was satisfying. He added that it gives players motivations to complete side-quests. Justin McElroy of \"Polygon\" praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.\n\nThe game's multiplayer mode received mixed response. Carter compared the competitive multiplayer to that of \"Tomb Raider\", and called it \"skippable\". He considered the co-operative multiplayer a fun addition to the game, but was disappointed by its limitations. He also added that the game would still be a strong title without these multiplayer elements. Bertz from \"Game Informer\" also found the multiplayer shallow and poorly-executed. He also criticized the lack of a large player pool and dedicated servers. Evans-Thirlwell of GamesRadar thought that the game's co-operative multiplayer were fun to play, but the asymmetrical competitive multiplayer was easy to forget. In contrast, \"GameZone\" Splechta thought that the competitive multiplayer mode was \"a surprise\" for him. Dyer echoed similar statement, and he thought that it had successfully captured the scale and freedom offered by both the game's co-op and campaign.\n\nHarmon thought that \"Far Cry 4\" was an improvement over \"Far Cry 3\", but he thought that the game felt and played too similarly to \"Far Cry 3\", and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for \"Far Cry 4\" is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by \"Far Cry 4\" did not stray far away from \"Far Cry 3\". Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to \"Far Cry 3\", but also other Ubisoft franchises like \"Assassin's Creed\" and \"Watch Dogs\". Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by \"Far Cry 4\" was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.\n\nUbisoft expected the game to sell at least six million copies in its first year of release. \"Far Cry 4\" became the fastest-selling game and the most successful launch in the series in the first week of release. \"Far Cry 4\" was the second best selling game in the United Kingdom for all-formats during the week of its release, only behind \"Grand Theft Auto V\". It was also the sixth best selling game in the US according to The NPD Group. As of December 31, 2014, the game has shipped seven million copies.\n\nThe game received the Best Shooter Award from IGN. The game was nominated for Best Artistic Achievement, Best Game Design, Best Music, Best Performer (Troy Baker), and Best Story at the 11th British Academy Games Awards. At the DICE Awards, it was nominated for Game of the Year, Action Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design, Outstanding Technical Achievement and Outstanding Achievement in Game Design, and won the award for Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition. At the BAFTA Game Awards, Far Cry 4 received five nominations including best game design and best story eventually winning for best music. The game won \"Game of the Year\" and \"Art Direction, Contemporary\" (Jean-Alexis Doyon) in 2014 by National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) and received six nominations: \"Use of Sound, Franchise\" (Yassine Abouelfalah), \"Sound Editing in a Game Cinema\" (Ding Jun Mei), \"Graphics, Technical\" (Danny Deslongchamps), \"Game, Franchise Action\" (Cedric Decelle), \"Game Design, Franchise\" (Gauthier Malou) and \"Direction in a Game Cinema\" (Sébastien Bergeron).\n"}
{"id": "13269942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13269942", "title": "First-year composition", "text": "First-year composition\n\nFirst-year composition (sometimes known as freshman composition or freshman writing) is an introductory core curriculum writing course in American colleges. This course focuses on improving students' abilities to write in a university setting and introduces students to writing practices in the disciplines and professions. These courses are traditionally required of incoming students, thus the previous name, \"Freshman Composition\". Scholars working within the field of Composition-Rhetoric often have teaching First-year composition (FYC) courses as the practical focus of their scholarly work. \n\nFYC courses are structured in a variety of ways. Some institutions of higher education require only one term of FYC, while others require two or three courses. There are a number of identifiable pedagogies associated with FYC, including: current-traditional, expressivist, social-epistemic, process, post-process and Writing about Writing (WAW). Each of these pedagogies can generate a multitude of curricula. \n\nComposition professionals, including those with degrees in Writing Studies and Rhetoric and Composition, often focus on a rhetorical approach to help students learn how to apply an understanding of audience, purpose, context, invention, and style to their writing processes. This rhetorical approach has shown that real writing, rather than existing as isolated modes, has more to do with a writer choosing from among many approaches to perform rhetorical tasks. In addition to a focus on rhetoric, many first year composition courses also emphasize writing process, where students are encouraged to interact with classmates and receive feedback to be used for revision. These practices can take the form of essay peer review or workshopping. Portfolios are a common way of assessing revised student work.\n\nSince the late nineteenth century, college courses on composition have become increasingly common in American higher education. Although a longstanding course offering at many colleges, first-year composition remains controversial and marginalized.\n\nThe requirement for a first-year composition course has been debated in composition studies. This debate centers around how effective the first-year composition course is and the changes that need to be made to develop the field of composition. While most schools do require some form of the first-year composition course, there are some schools that have decided to abolish the first-year composition requirement. Some scholars, such as Sharon Crowley in \"Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays,\" argue that this requirement should be abolished. Crowley does not suggest the course itself be removed, only the requirement that all freshmen take the course. She states that students would still be interested in the course if the requirement was abolished and that removing the requirement would strengthen the field of composition. She implies that composition studies is marginalized within the university because of the view of the first-year composition course as a skill course. Removing the requirement, she states, would remove the association of composition studies with introductory courses, giving more acknowledgement to the field. Crowley's opinion initiated a debate in the composition field, but she is not the only critic who advocates for the removal of this requirement. Scholars Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle also dislike the requirement and instead argue for a writing studies curriculum. However, there are scholars who do not agree with this stance, argue that the first-year composition course is needed in the university, and believe that the requirement should remain. Scholar David Smit is one critic who favors keeping the requirement. He suggests that the requirement can be kept and the curriculum and structure of the first-year composition course altered for improvement. Smit explains that many of the developmental goals of those who favor abolishing the requirement can still be achieved by offering more writing experiences. He proposes more genre writing in composition courses with a \"scaffolding\" progression of discipline writing. If this was done, he suggests, the concerns over the status of composition studies in the university would still be solved, as the course would no longer be seen as skills based. There has been no consensus reached in composition studies regarding the status of the first-year composition course requirement. The benefits of the course, as well as the drawbacks, continue to be debated and the scholars noted above are only a few of the voices and perspectives involved in this discussion. Despite the debate about the requirement, it remains in effect at a majority of universities.\n\nFirst-year composition is designed to meet the goals for successful completion set forth by the Council of Writing Program Administrators. To reach these goals, students must learn rhetorical conventions, critical thinking skills, information literacy, and the process of writing an academic paper. While there is no American standard curriculum for first-year composition, curriculum is developed at several levels, including the state, institution, department, and writing program.\n\nWith the publication of James Kinneavy's \"Theory of Discourse\" in 1971, English departments began incorporating rhetoric into their composition classrooms. In doing this, composition instructors have placed more emphasis on teaching audience analysis, Aristotle's three appeals (ethos, pathos, and logos), and teaching Kinneavy's modes of discourse.\nAccording to Brian Sutton in \"Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper,\" since 1980, there has been an increasing debate in academic circles as to whether the \"generic\" approach to writing in first year composition is useful for students whose future writing will be discipline specific (46).\n\nFirst described by Mina Shaughnessy in the 1970s, Basic writing is a division of composition studies that strives to bring disadvantaged students entering college to a more complete understanding of the rhetorical aspects of the writing process.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19637950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19637950", "title": "Housefly", "text": "Housefly\n\nThe housefly (\"Musca domestica\") is a fly of the suborder Cyclorrhapha. It is believed to have evolved in the Cenozoic era, possibly in the Middle East, and has spread all over the world as a commensal of humans. It is the most common fly species found in houses. Adults are grey to black, with four dark, longitudinal lines on the thorax, slightly hairy bodies, and a single pair of membranous wings. They have red eyes, set farther apart in the slightly larger female.\n\nThe female housefly usually mates only once and stores the sperm for later use. She lays batches of about 100 eggs on decaying organic matter such as food waste, carrion, or faeces. These soon hatch into legless white larvae, known as maggots. After 2 to 5 days of development, these metamorphose into reddish-brown pupae, about long. Adult flies normally live for 2 to 4 weeks, but can hibernate during the winter. The adults feed on a variety of liquid or semiliquid substances, as well as solid materials which have been softened by their saliva. They can carry pathogens on their bodies and in their faeces, contaminate food, and contribute to the transfer of food-borne illnesses, while, in numbers, they can be physically annoying. For these reasons, they are considered pests.\n\nHouseflies have been used in the laboratory in research into ageing and sex determination. Flies appear in literature from Ancient Greek myth and Aesop's \"The Impertinent Insect\" onwards. Authors sometimes choose the fly to speak of the brevity of life, as in William Blake's 1794 poem \"The Fly\", which deals with mortality subject to uncontrollable circumstances.\n\nAdult houseflies are usually long with a wingspan of . The females tend to be larger winged than males, while males have relatively longer legs. Females tend to vary more in size and there is geographic variation with larger individuals in higher latitudes. The head is strongly convex in front and flat and slightly conical behind. The pair of large compound eyes almost touch in the male, but are more widely separated in the female. They have three simple eyes (ocelli) and a pair of short antennae. Flies process visual information around seven times more quickly than humans, enabling them to identify and avoid attempts to catch or swat them, since they effectively see the human's movements in slow motion with their higher flicker fusion rate.\n\nThe mouthparts are specially adapted for a liquid diet; the mandibles and maxillae are reduced and not functional, and the other mouthparts form a retractable, flexible proboscis with an enlarged, fleshy tip, the labellum. This is a sponge-like structure that is characterised by many grooves, called pseudotracheae, which suck up fluids by capillary action. It is also used to distribute saliva to soften solid foods or collect loose particles. Houseflies have chemoreceptors, organs of taste, on the tarsi of their legs, so they can identify foods such as sugars by walking over them. Flies are often seen cleaning their legs by rubbing them together, enabling the chemoreceptors to taste afresh whatever they walk on next. At the end of each leg is a pair of claws, and below them are two adhesive pads, pulvilli, enabling the fly to walk up smooth walls and ceilings using Van der Waals forces. The claws help the fly to unstick the foot for the next step. Flies walk with a common gait on horizontal and vertical surfaces with three legs in contact with the surface and three in movement. On inverted surfaces, they alter the gait to keep four feet stuck to the surface. Flies land on a ceiling by flying straight towards it; just before landing, they make a half roll and point all six legs at the surface, absorbing the shock with the front legs and sticking a moment later with the other four, also.\n\nThe thorax is a shade of gray, sometimes even black, with four dark, longitudinal bands of even width on the dorsal surface. The whole body is covered with short hairs. Like other Diptera, houseflies have only one pair of wings; what would be the hind pair is reduced to small halteres that aid in flight stability. The wings are translucent with a yellowish tinge at their base. Characteristically, the medial vein (M1+2 or fourth long vein) shows a sharp upward bend. Each wing has a lobe at the back, the calypter, covering the haltere. The abdomen is gray or yellowish with a dark stripe and irregular dark markings at the side. It has 10 segments which bear spiracles for respiration. In males, the ninth segment bears a pair of claspers for copulation, and the 10th bears anal cerci in both sexes. \n\nA variety of species around the world appear similar to the housefly, such as the lesser house fly, \"Fannia canicularis\"; the stable fly, \"Stomoxys calcitrans\"; and other members of the genus \"Musca\" such as \"M. vetustissima\", the Australian bush fly and several closely related taxa that include \"M. primitiva\", \"M. shanghaiensis\", \"M. violacea\", and \"M. varensis\". The systematic identification of species may require the use of region-specific taxonomic keys and can require dissections of the male reproductive parts for confirmation.\n\nThe housefly is probably the insect with the widest distribution in the world; it is largely associated with humans and has accompanied them around the globe. It is present in the Arctic Circle, as well as in the tropics, where it is abundant. It is present in all populated parts of Europe, Asia, Australasia, and the Americas.\n\nThough the order of flies (Diptera) is much older, true houseflies are believed to have evolved in the beginning of the Cenozoic era. The housefly's superfamily, Muscoidea, is most closely related to the Oestroidea (blow flies and allies), and more distantly to the Hippoboscoidea (louse flies and allies). They are thought to have originated in the southern Palearctic region, particularly the Middle East. Because of their close, commensal relationship with humans, they probably owe their worldwide dispersal to co-migration with humans.\n\nThe housefly was first described as \"Musca domestica\" in 1758 based on the common European specimens by the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his \"Systema naturae\", and continues to be classified under that name. A more detailed description was given in 1776 by the Danish entomologist Johan Christian Fabricius in his \"Genera Insectorum\".\n\nEach female housefly can lay up to 500 eggs in a lifetime, in several batches of about 75 to 150. The eggs are white and are about in length, and they are deposited by the fly in a suitable place, usually dead and decaying organic matter, such as food waste, carrion, or faeces. Within a day, larvae (maggots) hatch from the eggs; they live and feed where they were laid. They are pale-whitish, long, thinner at the mouth end, and legless. Larval development takes from two weeks, under optimal conditions, to 30 days or more in cooler conditions. The larvae avoid light; the interiors of heaps of animal manure provide nutrient-rich sites and ideal growing conditions, warm, moist, and dark.\n\nAt the end of their fourth instar, the larvae crawl to a dry, cool place and transform into pupae. The pupal case is cylindrical with rounded ends, about long, and formed from the last shed larval skin. It is yellowish at first, darkening through red and brown to nearly black as it ages. Pupae complete their development in from two to six days at , but may take 20 days or more at .\n\nWhen metamorphosis is complete, the adult fly emerges from the pupa. To do this, it uses the ptilinum, an eversible pouch on its head, to tear open the end of the pupal case. The adult housefly lives from two weeks to a month in the wild, or longer in benign laboratory conditions. Having emerged from the pupa, it ceases to grow; a small fly is not necessarily a young fly, but is instead the result of getting insufficient food during the larval stage.\n\nMale houseflies are sexually mature after 16 hours and females after 24. Females produce a pheromone, (Z)-9-tricosene (muscalure). This cuticular hydrocarbon is not released into the air and males sense it only on contact with females; it has found use as in pest control, for luring males to fly traps. The male initiates the mating by bumping into the female, in the air or on the ground, known as a \"strike\". He climbs on to her thorax, and if she is receptive, a courtship period follows, in which the female vibrates her wings and the male strokes her head. The male then reverses onto her abdomen and the female pushes her ovipositor into his genital opening; copulation, with sperm transfer, lasts for several minutes. Females normally mate only once and then reject further advances from males, while males mate multiple times. A volatile semiochemical that is deposited by females on their eggs attracts other gravid females and leads to clustered egg deposition.\n\nThe larvae depend on warmth and sufficient moisture to develop; generally, the warmer the temperature, the faster they grow. In general, fresh swine and chicken manures present the best conditions for the developing larvae, reducing the larval period and increasing the size of the pupae. Cattle, goat, and horse manures produce fewer, smaller pupae, while fully composted swine manure, with a water content under 40%, produces none at all. Pupae can range from about under different conditions.\n\nThe lifecycle can be completed in seven to 10 days under optimal conditions, but may take up to two months in adverse circumstances. In temperate regions, 12 generations may occur per year, and in the tropics and subtropics, more than 20.\n\nHouseflies play an important ecological role in breaking down and recycling organic matter. Adults are mainly carnivorous; their primary food is animal matter, carrion, and faeces, but they also consume milk, sugary substances, and rotting fruit and vegetables. Solid foods are softened with saliva before being sucked up. They can be opportunistic blood feeders. Houseflies have a mutualistic relationship with the bacterium \"Klebsiella oxytoca\", which can live on the surface of housefly eggs and deter fungi which compete with the fly larvae for nutrients.\n\nAdult houseflies are diurnal and rest at night. If inside a building after dark, they tend to congregate on ceilings, beams, and overhead wires, while out of doors, they crawl into foliage or long grass, or rest in shrubs and trees or on wires. In cooler climates, some houseflies hibernate in winter, choosing to do so in cracks and crevices, gaps in woodwork, and the folds of curtains. They arouse in the spring when the weather warms up, and search out a place to lay their eggs.\n\nHouseflies have many predators, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, various insects, and spiders. The eggs, larvae, and pupae have many species of stage-specific parasites and parasitoids. Some of the more important are the parasitic wasps \"Muscidifurax uniraptor\" and \"Spalangia cameroni\"; these lay their eggs in the fly larvae tissue and their offspring complete their development before the adult flies can emerge from the pupae. Hister beetles feed on housefly larvae in manure heaps and the predatory mite \"Macrocheles muscae domesticae\" consumes housefly eggs, each mite eating 20 eggs per day.\n\nHouseflies sometimes carry phoretic (nonparasitic) passengers including mites such as \"Macrocheles muscaedomesticae\", and the pseudoscorpion \"Lamprochernes chyzeri\".\n\nThe pathogenic fungus \"Entomophthora muscae\" causes a fatal disease in houseflies. After infection, the fungal hyphae grow throughout the body, killing the fly in about 5 days. Infected flies have been known to seek high temperatures that could suppress the growth of the fungus. Affected females tend to be more attractive to males, but the fungus-host interactions have not been fully understood. The housefly also acts as the alternative host to the parasitic nematode \"Habronema muscae\" that attacks horses.\n\nFlies are a nuisance, disturbing people at leisure and at work, but they are disliked principally because of their habits of contaminating foodstuffs. They alternate between breeding and feeding in dirty places with feeding on human foods, during which process they soften the food with saliva and deposit their faeces, creating a health hazard. However, fly larvae are as nutritious as fish meal, and could be used to convert waste to feed for fish and livestock.\n\nFlies have been used in art and artefacts in many cultures. In 16th- and 17th-century European vanitas paintings, flies sometimes occur as \"memento mori\". They may also be used for other effects as in the Flemish painting, the \"Master of Frankfurt\" (1496). Fly amulets were popular in ancient Egypt.\n\nHouseflies can fly for several miles from their breeding places, carrying a wide variety of organisms on their hairs, mouthparts, vomitus, and faeces. Parasites carried include cysts of protozoa, e.g. \"Entamoeba histolytica\" and \"Giardia lamblia\" and eggs of helminths, e.g., \"Ascaris lumbricoides\", \"Trichuris trichiura\", \"Hymenolepis nana\", and \"Enterobius vermicularis\". Houseflies do not serve as a secondary host or act as a reservoir of any bacteria of medical or veterinary importance, but they do serve as mechanical vectors to over 100 pathogens, such as those causing typhoid, cholera, salmonellosis, bacillary dysentery, tuberculosis, anthrax, ophthalmia, and pyogenic cocci, making them especially problematic in hospitals and during outbreaks of certain diseases. Disease-causing organisms on the outer surface of the fly may survive for a few hours, but those in the crop or gut can be viable for several days. Usually, too few bacteria are on the external surface of the flies (except perhaps for \"Shigella\") to cause infection, so the main routes to human infection are through the fly's regurgitation and defecation.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Canadian public health workers believed that the control of flies was important in controlling the spread of tuberculosis. A \"swat that fly\" contest was held for children in Montreal in 1912. Flies were targeted in 1916, when a polio epidemic broke out in the eastern United States. The belief that fly control was key to disease control continued, with extensive use of insecticidal spraying, well until the mid 1950s, declining only after the introduction of Salk's vaccine. In China, Mao Zedong's Four Pests Campaign between 1958 and 1962 exhorted the people to catch and kill flies, along with rats, mosquitoes, and sparrows.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Japanese worked on entomological warfare techniques under Shirō Ishii. Japanese Yagi bombs developed at Pingfan consisted of two compartments, one with houseflies and another with a bacterial slurry that coated the flies prior to release. \"Vibrio cholerae\", which causes cholera, was the bacterium of choice, and was used in China in Baoshan in 1942, and in northern Shandong in 1943. Baoshan had been used by the Allies and bombing produced epidemics that killed 60,000 people in the initial stages reaching a radius of 200 km, which finally took a toll of 200,000 victims. The Shandong attack killed 210,000; the occupying Japanese troops had been vaccinated in advance.\n\nThe ability of housefly larvae to feed and develop in a wide range of decaying organic matter is important for recycling of nutrients in nature. This could be exploited to combat ever-increasing amounts of waste. Housefly larvae can be mass-reared in a controlled manner in animal manure, reducing the bulk of waste and minimizing environmental risks of its disposal. Harvested maggots may be used as feed for animal nutrition.\n\nFlies can be controlled, at least to some extent, by physical, chemical, or biological means. Physical controls include screening with small mesh or the use of vertical strips of plastic or strings of beads in doorways to prevent entry of flies into buildings. Fans to create air movement or air barriers in doorways can deter flies from entering, and food premises often use ultraviolet light traps that electrocute insects. Sticky fly papers hanging from the ceiling can also be effective. Another approach is the elimination as far as possible of potential breeding sites. Keeping garbage in lidded containers and collecting it regularly and frequently, prevents any eggs laid from developing into adults. Unhygienic rubbish tips are a prime fly-breeding site, but if garbage is covered by a layer of soil, preferably daily, this can be avoided.\n\nInsecticides can be used. Larvicides kill the developing larvae, but large quantities may need to be used to reach areas below the surface. Aerosols can be used in buildings to \"zap\" flies, but outside applications are only temporarily effective. Residual sprays on walls or resting sites have a longer-lasting effect. Many strains of housefly have become immune to the most commonly used insecticides.\n\nSeveral means of biological pest control have been investigated. These include the introduction of another species, the black soldier fly (\"Hermetia illucens\"), whose larvae compete with those of the housefly for resources. The introduction of dung beetles to churn up the surface of a manure heap and render it unsuitable for breeding is another approach. Augmentative biological control by releasing parasitoids can be used, but flies breed so fast that the natural enemies are unable to keep up.\n\nThe ease of culturing houseflies, and the relative ease of handling them when compared to the fruit fly \"Drosophila\", have made them useful as model organism for use in laboratories. The American entomologist Vincent Dethier, in his humorous \"To Know A Fly\" (1962), pointed out that as a laboratory animal, houseflies did not trouble anyone sensitive to animal cruelty. Houseflies have a small number of chromosomes, haploid six or diploid 12. Because the somatic tissue of the housefly consists of long-lived postmitotic cells, it can be used as an informative model system for understanding cumulative age-related cellular alterations. Oxidative DNA damage 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine in houseflies was found in one study to increase with age and reduce life expectancy supporting the hypothesis that oxidative molecular damage is a causal factor in senescence (aging).\n\nThe housefly is an object of biological research, partly for its variable sex-determination mechanism. Although a wide variety of sex-determination mechanisms exists in nature (e.g. male and female heterogamy, haplodiploidy, environmental factors), the way sex is determined is usually fixed within a species. The housefly is, however, thought to exhibit multiple mechanisms for sex determination, such as male heterogamy (like most insects and mammals), female heterogamy (like birds), and maternal control over offspring sex. The exact mechanism of sex determination involved is unresolved, but sexual differentiation is controlled as in other insects by an ancient developmental switch, doublesex, which is regulated by the transformer protein in many different insects. The antimicrobial peptides produced by housefly maggots are of pharmacological interest.\n\nIn the 1970s, the aircraft modeller Frank Ehling constructed miniature balsa-wood aircraft powered by live houseflies. Studies of tethered flies have helped in the understanding of insect vision, sensory perception, and flight control.\n\n\"The Impertinent Insect\" is a group of five fables, sometimes ascribed to Aesop, concerning an insect, in one version a fly, which puffs itself up to seem important. In the Biblical fourth plague of Egypt, flies represent death and decay, while the Philistine god Beelzebub's name may mean \"lord of the flies\". In Greek mythology, Myiagros was a god who chased away flies during the sacrifices to Zeus and Athena; Zeus sent a fly to bite Pegasus, causing Bellerophon to fall back to Earth when he attempted to ride the winged steed to Mount Olympus. In the traditional Navajo religion, Big Fly is an important spirit being.\n\nWilliam Blake's 1794 poem \"The Fly\", part of his collection \"Songs of Experience\", deals with the insect's mortality, subject to uncontrollable circumstances, just like humans. Emily Dickinson's 1855 poem \"I Heard a Fly Buzz When I Died\" speaks of flies in the context of death. In William Golding's 1954 novel \"Lord of the Flies\", the fly is however a symbol of the children involved.\n\nOgden Nash's humorous two-line 1942 poem \"God in His wisdom made the fly/And then forgot to tell us why.\" indicates the debate about the value of biodiversity, given that even those considered by humans as pests have their place in the world's ecosystems.\n\n"}
{"id": "4200203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4200203", "title": "Incredible India", "text": "Incredible India\n\nIncredible India (styled as Incredıble!ndıa) is the name of an international tourism campaign maintained by the Government of India since 2002, to promote tourism in India to an audience of global appeal.\n\nThe \"Incredible India\" title was officially branded and promoted by Amitabh Kant, the then Joint Secretary under the Union Ministry of Tourism, in 2002.\n\nIn 2002, India's Ministry of Tourism launched a campaign to promote India as a popular tourist destination. The phrase \"Incredible India\" was adopted as a slogan by the ministry. Before 2002, the Indian government had regularly formulated policies and prepared pamphlets and brochures for the promotion of tourism, however, it had not supported tourism in a concerted fashion. In 2002, the tourism ministry made a conscious effort to bring in more professionalism in its attempts to promote tourism. It formulated an integrated communication strategy with the aim of promoting India as a destination of choice for the discerning traveller. The tourism ministry engaged the services of advertising and marketing firm Ogilvy & Mather (O&M) India to create a new campaign to increase tourist inflows into the country.\n\nThe campaign portrayed India as an attractive tourist destination by showcasing different aspects of Indian culture and history like yoga, spirituality, etc. The campaign was conducted globally and received appreciation from tourism industry observers and travellers alike. However, the campaign also attracted criticism from some quarters. Some observers felt that it had failed to cover several aspects of India which would have been attractive to the average tourist.\n\nIn 2008, the Ministry of Tourism launched a campaign targeted at the local population to educate them regarding good behaviour and etiquette when dealing with foreign tourists. Indian actor Aamir Khan was commissioned to endorse the campaign which was titled \"Atithidevo Bhava\", Sanskrit for \"Guests are like God\". Atithidevo Bhava was aimed at creating awareness about the effects of tourism and sensitising the local population about preservation of India's heritage, culture, cleanliness and hospitality. It also attempted to instil a sense of responsibility towards tourists and reinforce the confidence of foreign tourists towards India as a preferred holiday destination. The concept was designed to complement the Incredible India campaign.\n\nIn 2009, Minister of tourism, Kumari Selja unveiled plans to extend the Incredible India campaign to the domestic tourism sector as well. US$12 million out of a total budget of US$200 million was allocated in 2009 for the purpose of promoting domestic tourism.\n\nIn 2015, Aamir Khan, whose comments on perceived intolerance in the country had created a controversy, ceased to be the mascot for the Incredible India campaign when the contract for it expired. The new brand ambassador of Incredible India was Narendra Modi himself.\n\nIn 2017, veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan & actress Priyanka Chopra were chosen as the new brand ambassadors for the Incredible India campaign.\n\nAccording to spending data released by Visa Asia Pacific in March 2006, India has emerged as the fastest growing market in the Asia-Pacific region in terms of international tourist spending. The data revealed that international tourists spent US$372 million in India in the fourth quarter (October–December) of 2005, 25% more than in the fourth quarter of 2004. China, which came second in the region, managed to raise US$784 million from international tourism in Q4 2005, a growth of 23% over its Q4 2004 figures. The tourist spending figures for India would have satisfied the Indian tourism ministry, which had been targeting the high-end market through its long running Incredible India communication campaign..\n\nIndian travel industry analysts and tour operators were appreciative of the high standards of the Incredible India campaign. \"The promo campaign is making a powerful visual impact and creating a perception of India being a magical place to visit,\" said Anne Morgaon Scully, President, McCabe Bremer Travel, Virginia, U.S. Average travelers too appeared to find the campaign interesting and informative, going by favourable comments on blogs on travel websites. Although Incredible India was generally well received, industry observers differed in their opinions on the positioning of India in the campaign. G.S.Murari, Director, Fidelis Advertising and Marketing Private Ltd. stated that he was uncomfortable with the tagline \"Incredible India\" and was of the opinion that since India was not a uni-dimensional country like Singapore or the Maldives, using a word like 'incredible' to describe India as a whole was not appropriate. In 2011, Arjun Sharma, Managing Director, Le Passage to India, stated that the campaign had lived its life and needed to be reinvented.\nThe Ministry of Tourism again engaged Ogilvy & Mather for a period of three years, starting in 2012, to redefine the brand and provide a strategic vision for the campaign.\n\nIn 2013, Incredible India, Ministry of Tourism partnered with WoNoBo.com to launch Walking Tours, an online experience where users navigate and route their way through cities based on a choice of themes.\n\nParvez Dewan Secretary, Ministry of Tourism launched a personalised itinerary planner called Tripigator, a website aimed at providing all travel itineraries in one tab to reduce travellers' efforts.\n\n\n"}

Raymond in his essay and book \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\" (1999). The law states that \"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\"; or more formally: \"Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.\" Presenting the code to multiple developers with the purpose of reaching consensus about its acceptance is a simple form of software reviewing. Researchers and practitioners have repeatedly shown the effectiveness of various types of reviewing process in finding bugs and security issues, and also that .\n\nIn \"Facts and Fallacies about Software Engineering,\" Robert Glass refers to the law as a \"mantra\" of the open source movement, but calls it a fallacy due to the lack of supporting evidence and because research has indicated that the rate at which additional bugs are uncovered does not scale linearly with the number of reviewers; rather, there is a small maximum number of useful reviewers, between two and four, and additional reviewers above this number uncover bugs at a much lower rate. While closed-source practitioners also promote stringent, independent code analysis during a software project's development, they focus on in-depth review by a few and not primarily the number of \"eyeballs\".\n\nAlthough detection of even deliberately inserted flaws can be attributed to Raymond's claim, the persistence of the Heartbleed security bug in a critical piece of code for two years has been considered as a refutation of Raymond's dictum. Larry Seltzer suspects that the availability of source code may cause some developers and researchers to perform less extensive tests than they would with closed source software, making it easier for bugs to remain.\nIn 2015, the Linux Foundation's executive director Jim Zemlin argued that the complexity of modern software has increased to such levels that specific resource allocation is desirable to improve its security. Regarding some of 2014's largest global open source software vulnerabilities, he says, \"In these cases, the eyeballs weren't really looking\". Large scale experiments or peer-reviewed surveys to test how well the mantra holds in practice have not been performed.\n"}

{"id": "30367482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30367482", "title": "Melanau calendar", "text": "Melanau calendar\n\nThe Melanau calendar () is a calendar used by the Melanau people of Borneo. Its year consists of 12 months. The first month, \"Pengejin\", signifies the celebration of the Kaul festival (a giving of thanks for the preceding year, with prayers for the year ahead). Each month in the Melanau calendar consists of 30 days. It is guided by the constellations, natural phenomena and guardian spirits. Each month is named for occurrences during the month or events which are supposed to have occurred during that particular month, according to legend. The rise and fall of the Sun, the Moon and the stars determine the time for planting, harvesting, fishing, building, travel and marriage.\n\nThe Melanau concept of the universe is a multilayered one, in which the territories of all should be respected and a balance maintained. Hence, it is important to be aware of one's surroundings: changes in the weather, the wind, the tides and the position of the constellations. The Melanau calendar is a guide for daily activities such as fishing, planting, harvesting, homebuilding and marriage, because the calendar is guided by the constellations and the ways of nature, spirits and God.\n\nThis month coincides with the Gregorian month of March. During this month it is windy; light rain showers fall during the early part of the month. The wind gradually strengthens, the sun moves north and the moon replaces the original position of the sun. Fish are plentiful in forest ponds, as they search for food; afterwards, they again go into hiding. \"Bulan Pengejin\" marks the beginning of the year. Since it is difficult for the Melanau to work outdoors because of the strong wind, they spend their time indoors cleaning the tools of their trades. At the end of the month, the Melanau purify themselves and call the fish from the beaches and river mouths in a ceremony known as \"Kaul\". The Melanau build a large swing (known as a \"Tibow\"); during its construction they sing the \"tibow\" song, seeking the blessings of their guardian gods for plentiful flowers, bountiful harvests of fruits and fish and the removal of illness and evil. They send offerings (known as \"Seraheng\") out to sea to appease the gods and invite them to the feast. After the feast, leftover food and drink is left by the shore for the guardians spirits to take with them; nothing is kept.\n\nThis second month coincides with the month of April. During \"Pengelawah Umik\", it is said that all the fish will come down to the sea; the sea turns a greenish color, a call to the fish that it is time to surface. For the Melanau, this month begins the fishing season. Melanau fishermen were formerly known for their \"barong panau\", a fishing sailboat which could go out to sea for weeks on end and doubled as a travel and trade boat. The \"barong panau\" is no longer used, since the skills to build them have been lost. A picture of the boat may be found a Brooke-era postage stamp.\n\nThe third month coincides with the month of May, when the emerald-greenish sea color first observed in \"Pengelawah Umik\" reaches the shore and the fishing season reaches its peak. Towards the end of this month, the sea loses its opaque green color and the sea floor will be visible from the surface; fishing becomes more challenging at the end of the first fishing season, which concludes at the beginning of \"Paka Umik\", when winds and rain make fishing impossible.\n\nThe fourth month coincides with the month of June, when the Seven Sisters appear in the skies. According to legend the west wind blows hard, to arrange the stars in the sky. During this month the Melanau go into the forest and begin the planting season, cutting large trees and vines and planting their crops. The farmers will continue their jungle-clearing work until the beginning of the next month, \"Paka Ayeng\".\n\nThe fifth month coincides with July. The Seven Sisters are high in the sky, and the Three Stars appear lower in the sky. The wind blows with gale force; all farming and fishing activities cease for the month (due to the strong winds) until the next month, \"Pelepa\".\n\nThe sixth month coincides with August. The Three Stars replace the Seven Sisters, rising high in the sky. The wind drops; the sea is calm and the second fishing season begins before the long monsoon (\"suloh\"), when no work can be done due to wind and heavy rain. This fishing season lasts until the beginning of the next month, \"Pegalan\".\n\nThe seventh month coincides with September. The sea remains calm, but little fishing is done since the fish are spawning. \"Pegalan\" is named for the \"Pegalan\" (North) Star, which is high in the sky in the evening. Legend has it that this is the month when the Melanau find it difficult to \"swallow their saliva\" (look for food). Marriage is taboo during this month, since it is believed it would lead to difficulty making a living.\n\nThe eighth month coincides with October. During \"Suwah\", the ground seems to rise like waves; according to Melanau belief this is caused by fish swimming back to the ocean, their fins resembling waves. \"Suwah\" marks the third (and final) fishing season for the year; it is also the time to start planting rice, sago palm and other crops. In Melanau tradition, as the earth grows so will the crops that are planted.\n\nThe ninth month, coinciding with November, is the beginning of the monsoon season (\"suloh\"). Strong winds begin to blow, shifting the location (it is believed) of the sun and moon (called \"bulan tenggara\", the southeast moon). It is the end of the fishing season; in the morning the sea is calm, but by afternoon the waves will be high.\n\nThe tenth month coincides with December. It is the time when rains come, allowing flowers to blossom and fruits to bear in the forest.\n\nThe eleventh month coincides with January. Legend has it that long a shaman was beheaded by his wife. His head disappeared from the house (becoming the Taboo Star) and the month is named for the killing of the shaman. During this month all activity (marriage, fishing, planting and homebuilding) is taboo, and \"Pemalei\" is regarded as a month of misfortune.\n\n\"Pengesiseng\" coincides with the month of February. Strong winds bring heavy rain, blowing flowers off trees and uprooting them; floodwaters then bring them to the sea, where they are pushed ashore by huge waves. The wind blows branches and fronds of the coconut, sago palms and other trees, opening them to resemble the gills of a fish (hence its name). \"Pengesiseng\" marks the end of the Melanau year.\n\n"}

The main difference between a mental space and a possible world is that a mental space does not contain a faithful representation of reality, but an idealized cognitive model. Building of mental spaces and establishment of mappings between those mental spaces are the two main processes involved in construction of meaning.\nIt is one of the basic components in Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner's blending theory, a theory within Cognitive semantics.\n\nBase space, also known as reality space, presents the interlocutors' shared knowledge of the real world. Space builders are elements within a sentence that establish spaces distinct from, yet related to the base space constructed. Space builders can be expressions like prepositional phrases, adverbs, connectives, and subject-verb combinations that are followed by an embedded sentence. They require hearers to establish scenarios beyond the present point of time. A built space depicts a situation that only holds true for that space itself, but may or may not be true in reality. The base space and built spaces are occupied by elements that map onto each other. These elements include categories that may refer to specific entities in those categories. According to Fauconnier's Access Principle, specific entities of a category in a space can be described by its counterpart category in another space even if it differs from the specific entity in the other space. An example of a built space can be seen in the example \" Mary wants to buy a book\". In this case, the built space is not that of reality, but Mary's desire space. Though the book in reality space refers to any book in general, it can still be used to describe the book in Mary's desire space, which may or may not be a specific book.\n\n‘if A then B’ sentences create another two spaces called foundation space and expansion space in addition to the base space. The foundation space is a hypothetical space relative to the base space set up by the space builder \"if\". The expansion space is set up by the space builder \"then\". If the conditions in the foundation space hold, the expansion space follows.\n\n"}

According to Davidson, those of us in higher education are paradoxically obsessed with the implications of living in the \"digital age,\" even though we have “yet to rethink how we need to be organizing our institutions—our schools, our offices—to maximize the opportunities of our digital era” (12). We tend to uphold models of teaching and assessments that no longer serve a generation of students who face a myriad of new challenges, as they attempt to learn to think critically in an era of information overload. Technology in all its forms is playing an increasingly important role in the lives of students. Colleges and universities, therefore, need to pay attention to the impact that the appropriate uses of digital tools can have on extending, enhancing, and enriching the student learning experience, both on and off campus. Moreover, and more importantly, Davidson argues that sustained exposure to such a range of digital media demands a different kind of attention than we previously required.\n\nIn \"Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn\" Cathy Davidson examines the phenomenon of attention blindness: humans perceive only a fraction of everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the multi-task oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of \"Now You See It,\" Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax as she watched the tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.\n\nDavidson argues that as a culture, our attention blindness represents a significant challenge that we must examine and meet head on; particularly since the Internet has revolutionized virtually every aspect of how our lives function now. The Internet, Davidson suggests, has catapulted us into an immediate, collaborative, and interconnected existence that is characterized by the sudden breakdown of barriers between private and public, work and play, domestic and foreign, office and home, etc. Davidson notes that although our lives have been irrevocably altered in these fundamental ways, our most important educational, corporate, and social institutions have not substantially changed in correlation with these upheavals. She claims that those in educational and corporate spheres continue to operate in 20th century modes (founded to meet the challenges of industrialization) as though we were currently not living through momentous, epochal changes.\n\n“With the Internet, we have seen dramatic rearrangements, in a little over a decade, in the most basic aspects of how we communicate, interact, gather knowledge of the world, develop and recognize our social networks and our communities, do business and exchange goods, understand what is true, and know what counts and is worthy of attention” (11).\n\n“This book starts from certain core questions: \n\nTechnology, Davidson argues, re-shapes the way we learn and process new information in some fundamental ways. We surf hundreds of news feeds, immediately discriminating between the ones we need to read and the ones we don't. In our work environments, we are forced to focus, divide, and re-focus our attention as we are dealing with multiple tasks at the same time. Within this multitasking that the new workplace requires, Davidson urges her readers to re-imagine the concept of distraction. We are cultured to imagine that shopping online while finishing a report or answering personal emails and simultaneously working on a project are distractions which are detrimental to our productivity and efficiency. Every time we switch tasks, we are hurting our work. Davidson argues, however, that these small distractions afforded by technology should be thought of as innovations. \"When we feel distracted, something’s up. Distraction is really another word for saying that something is new, strange or different. We should pay attention to that feeling… Distraction is one of the best tools for innovation we have at our disposal—for changing patterns of attention and beginning the process of learning new patterns\"\n\nIn addition to transforming our workplace and everyday life, Davidson argues that technology allows us a great opportunity to rethink the way we teach and organize our education system. In addition to the famous iPod experiment described earlier, Davidson suggests that gaming, blogging, self-grading, and collaborative learning are among the effective and innovative teaching tools and strategies, whose benefits outweigh those offered by the \"one-size-fits-all model of standards that evolved over the course of the twentieth century.\" In the chapter, \"Project Classroom Makeover,\" Davidson argues that the current education system is blind to the ways in which children learn and solve complex problems today, such as: creating and memorizing names and avatars of online game players, creating and writing simple codes to advance in games, searching internet for new information, and engaging with it in new creative ways. If the education system harnesses these natural curiosities through restructured curricula, it can promote creative and critical thinking and allow students to develop in their own, unique ways, rather than forcing them to fit into the standardized system of skills.\n\nAs an example of a Made-Over Classroom, Davidson discusses an experimental school Quest 2 Learn. Q2L is a school whose curriculum is based on the principles of gaming. There students don't just go from class to class, completing regular assignments, they participate in quests, aimed at solving complex problems, advancing from one level to another, culminating in a final project. This model, according to Davidson, has the potential to address the needs of children who are diagnosed with learning disabilities, such as ADHD or autism, allowing them to learn in ways that focus on their individual strengths without forcing them into a standardized learning structure, which could be detrimental to their engagement and future achievements.\n\nDavidson's \"Now You See It\" has received largely positive reviews. Publishers Weekly called \"Now You See It\" \"critically important\" and \"likely to shape discussions for years to come,\" while Howard Gardner of Harvard University celebrates Davidson for having \"a mind that ranges comfortably over literary arts, literacy, psychology, and brain science\" and predicts that her \"timely book is certain to attract a lot of attention and to catalyze many discussions.\"\n\nAs of February 2015, Amazon.com rated the book 4 out of 5 stars, based on 45 separate reviews.\n\nAlthough mainly positive, a few critical reactions question Davidson's \"youth worship\" and her \"enthusiasm for anything new and digital and by an almost allergic aversion to any practices or artifacts from the pre-Internet era.\"\n\nIn a generally positive review of \"Now You See It,\" in the journal \"portal: Libraries and the Academy,\" Andrew Battista wrote \"As inspiring as \"Now You See\" It can be, I would say that Davidson uncritically seeks to apply the doctrines of capitalist efficiency into contemporary learning. In fact, at times her vision of education seems to verge on a kind of fluency that will prepare people to compete in a new globalized economy rather than an altruistic experience that sees learning as the preparation of any fit participant in a democracy.\"\n\nCathy Davidson herself revealed in a comment to an online article titled \"Open Access, Public Intellectualism, and Academic Reform\" that despite not being a neuroscientist herself, she has received only one and a half bad reviews from neuroscientists, while frequently receiving fan notes from other neuroscientists agreeing with her stance on the brain.\n\nDavidson was appointed by President Barack Obama to a six-year term on the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired in North America on January 20, 2006. It was based on the short story by David Schow.\n\nOn a two-lane highway, two serial killers clash in a turf war: one is named Wheeler (Michael Moriarty) who kills hitchhikers he picks up in his truck, and the other is named Walker (Warren Kole) who is a hitchhiker who murders whoever gives him a ride. Stacia (Fairuza Balk), a recently divorced woman, falls in between the battle of wits.\nAfter a transport bus breaks down, Wheeler and Walker kill the driver and passengers — save for Stacia, who left previously. Fascinated, Wheeler and Walker examine each other's victims. Wheeler murders a woman (Laurene Landon) and hangs her body in the truck, and pistol whips and decapitates a man with the sliding door of the luggage compartment. Walker garrotes the bus driver with a dead snake, shoots a passenger, leaves another passenger to die tied by her wrists to a tree and wrapped in barbed wire (whom Wheeler finds alive and taunts), slaughters a punk, and partially skins his girlfriend before killing her.\n\nLater, at a roadside motel, the two psychopaths play head games with each other and Stacia, clashing over who will get to kill her. As she is leaving the motel, Wheeler offers her a ride then assaults her while driving, handcuffing her to the car. He finds Walker on the highway, standing in the lane, and brakes to a stop just before hitting him. Walker accepts a ride, and the two bicker and draw their pistols, ready to kill Stacia and each other. Stacia, sitting in the middle, slams on the brakes and sends the two murderers through the windshield onto the road and causes the truck's cab to fall on its side. Stacia unsuccessfully struggles to get Wheeler's gun, while the wounded Wheeler and Walker fight to determine who will kill her as an ambulance siren sounds.\n\nIn the end, Wheeler and Walker are side by side in the ambulance, still fighting and cursing at one another. Finally, they cease and declare a truce. Walker attempts to strike a deal with Wheeler as he points out how much fun the two of them could have with an ambulance, revealing that he still has his craft knife he used to torture the stoner's girlfriend. However, one of the EMTs rams syringes full of air into their chests, apparently killing them both. The new killer tells the driver that he plans to save Stacia (bound and gagged in an upper bunk of the ambulance) for later.\n"}

Cato included a recipe in his \"De Agri Cultura\" (160 BC). Cato writes: It derives from the Greek term \"plakous\" ( – \"plakountos\", from πλακόεις - \"plakoeis\", \"flat\") for thin or layered flat breads, and Andrew Dalby considers it, and surrounding dessert recipes in Cato, to be in the \"Greek tradition,\" possibly copied from a Greek cookbook. A flowery description of plakous was left by the Greek poet Antiphanes (fl. 3rd century BC).\n\nA number of scholars suggest that the Roman dessert's Eastern Roman (Byzantine) descendants, \"plakountas tetyromenous\" (\"cheesy placenta\") and \"koptoplakous\" (Byzantine Greek: κοπτοπλακοῦς), are the ancestors of modern tiropita (börek or banitsa) and baklava respectively. The name \"placenta\" () is used today on the island of Lesbos in Greece to describe a baklava-type dessert of layered pastry leaves containing crushed nuts that is baked and then covered in honey. Another variant of the Roman dish survived into the modern era as the Romanian plăcintă cake.\n\nThrough its Greek name \"plakountos,\" it was adopted into Armenian cuisine as \"plagindi,\" \"plagunda,\" and \"pghagund,\" all \"cakes of bread and honey.\" From the latter term came the later Arabic name \"iflaghun,\" which is mentioned in the medieval Arab cookbook \"Wusla ila al-habib\" as a speciality of the Cilician Armenians settled in southern Asia Minor and settled in the neighboring Crusader kingdoms of northern Syria. Thus, the dish may have traveled to the Levant in the Middle Ages via the Armenians, many of whom migrated there following the first appearance of the Turkish tribes in medieval Anatolia.\n"}
{"id": "11972619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11972619", "title": "Promoter (entertainment)", "text": "Promoter (entertainment)\n\nAn entertainment promoter works in entertainment industries, including music and sports, as an individual or organization in the business of marketing and promoting live, or pay-per-view and similar, events, such as concerts/gigs, sports events, festivals, raves, and nightclub performances.\n\nPromoters are typically engaged as independent contractors or representative companies by entertainment venues, earning a pre-arranged fee, or a share of revenues (colloquially known as a \"cut\" and \"share of the house\"), or both. A share of revenues is often a simple percentage of admission fees (called \"the door\") and/or food and drink sales, with many variations possible, such as minimums or maximums, allowances for various expenses, or limitations (such as only alcohol sales after midnight). Other promoters operate independently, renting venues for a fixed fee, or under a revenue sharing arrangement with the venue holder, thus keeping larger profits from successful events. One common arrangement for small venues is for the promoter to earn all of the admissions fees, while the venue retains all food and drink revenue.\n\nSome venues have exclusive arrangements with a single promotion company, others work with multiple promoters on a rotating schedule (one night per week, for example), or on an event-by-event basis. Promoters often work together — either as equal partners, or as subcontractors to each other's events. Several promoters may work together for a special event, such as a large New Year's Eve party in a hotel ballroom. They may also engage freelance hosts for their social influence; these amateur promoters market the events to their circle of friends and/or social media followers, in exchange for special treatment and/or free admission to the event and at times, and may form or be included in street teams that promote events at other live venues.\n\nMinimally, an event promoter manages publicity and advertising. Depending on the arrangement, they may also handle security, ticket sales, event admission (door policies), decorations, and booking of other entertainers. Many promoters are DJs or musicians themselves, and may perform at their own events. Some bloggers and individuals with a large following on social media may consider themselves as promoters and charge fees promotional service via their social media platform(s), or through their efforts. \n\nMany musicians and artists act as de facto promoters for their own concerts, either directly or through their manager or booking company. Historically, promotion has been a cottage industry, with companies operated by one or several well-connected charismatic individuals, often working part-time. However, with the rise of corporate ownership of live entertainment assets, several large companies have emerged in the field.\n\nThere are often disputes over money in the promotions industry because it is largely cash business with a history of corruption and uneven recordkeeping. In addition there are many accounting complexities to manage, particularly for large events: revenue, expenses, and oversight of parking, coat checks, concession vendor sales (e.g., CDs and t-shirts), box office so-called \"convenience fees\", in kind trades, promotional give-away items used to lure guests (e.g., free drinks), costs for insurance, cleaning staff, and so on. One area of frequent contention are quid pro quo cross-promotions, where the promoter or some other party connected with the venue will obtain a favor (for example, a price discount) in exchange for giving a future favor to the vendor. If the existence of the scheme, or the relationship between the parties, is undisclosed this may become a form of bribery. Another opportunity for misunderstanding are the various \"lists\" of guests who will be admitted for free or with VIP treatment, and the \"door policy\" used by bouncers to decide who will be admitted and at what price. To deal with these complexities event contracts can become quite long and detailed. Whether written or not, these arrangements tend to favor the party with the greater sophistication or the more control over the production of the event. Even the most detailed, professionally written and negotiated contracts can become the subject of lawsuits over interpretation.\n\nBecause nightclubs are often associated with drug and alcohol consumption, rowdiness, and other late-night behavior, promoters may become entangled in various criminal disputes as well.\n\nPromoters bring crowds through a variety of methods. The most direct are guerrilla marketing techniques such as plastering posters on outdoor walls, flyposting, and distributing handbills on windows of cars parked in entertainment districts. Promoters also keep mailing lists, usually email lists, of their preferred guests and their wider list of potential customers. Recently, many promoters have taken advantage of online technology such as online social networks and event listing sites to handle publicity, invitations, mailing lists, and so on. Clubs and promoters are among leaders in SMS text message advertising to their own lists as well as sponsored snippets on third-party lists for daily content to subscribers. Many fans promote events,products through their Facebook/Twitter/Myspace on their own free will.\n\nPromoters often build a brand out of their own personalities and the parties they host, marketing the events under a consistent name, style, type of program, and social experience that downplays the branding of the venue or artist. They may develop a loyal clientele that will follow them from one location to another.\n\nIn cosmopolitan cities with large affluent populations, there are upscale venues that employ the services of a special kind of promoter called an image promoter. The role of the image promoter is to bring celebrities or fashion models to high end venues and host them at a VIP table. In order to entice models and celebrities to come to the venue, the image promoter is provided with a VIP table and complementary alcohol. High end venues use the presence of models and celebrities to market their venue to an affluent clientele which may often only obtain admittance to the venue through agreeing to spend a certain amount of money on alcohol at the establishment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14660345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14660345", "title": "Realistic conflict theory", "text": "Realistic conflict theory\n\nRealistic conflict theory (initialized RCT), also known as realistic group conflict theory (initialized RGCT), is a social psychological model of intergroup conflict. The theory explains how intergroup hostility can arise as a result of conflicting goals and competition over limited resources, and it also offers an explanation for the feelings of prejudice and discrimination toward the outgroup that accompany the intergroup hostility. Groups may be in competition for a real or perceived scarcity of resources such as money, political power, military protection, or social status. \n\nFeelings of resentment can arise in the situation that the groups see the competition over resources as having a zero-sums fate, in which only one group is the winner (obtained the needed or wanted resources) and the other loses (unable to obtain the limited resource due to the \"winning\" group achieving the limited resource first). The length and severity of the conflict is based upon the perceived value and shortage of the given resource. According to RCT, positive relations can only be restored if superordinate goals are in place.\n\nThe theory was officially named by Donald Campbell, but has been articulated by others since the middle of the 20th century. In the 1960s, this theory developed from Campbell's recognition of social psychologists' tendency to reduce all human behavior to hedonistic goals. He criticized psychologists like John Thibaut, Harold Kelley, and George Homans, who emphasized theories that place food, sex, and pain avoidance as central to all human processes. According to Campbell, hedonistic assumptions do not adequately explain intergroup relations. Campbell believed that these social exchange theorists oversimplified human behavior by likening interpersonal interaction to animal behavior. Similar to the ideas of Campbell, other researchers also began recognizing a problem in the psychological understanding of intergroup behavior. These researchers noted that prior to Campbell, social exchange theorists ignored the essence of social psychology and the importance of interchanges between groups. To the contrary of prior theories, RCT takes into account the sources of conflict between groups, which include, incompatible goals and competition over limited resources.\n\nThe 1954 Robbers Cave Experiment by Muzafer Sherif and Carolyn Wood Sherif represents one of the most widely known demonstrations of RCT. The Sherifs' study was conducted over three weeks in a 200-acre summer camp in Robbers Cave State Park, Oklahoma, focusing on intergroup behavior. In this study, researchers posed as camp personnel, observing 22 eleven- and twelve-year-old boys who had never previously met and had comparable backgrounds.\n\nThe experiment was divided into three stages. The first stage being \"ingroup formation\", in which upon arrival the boys were split into two approximately equal groups based on similarities. Each group was unaware of the other group's presence. The second stage was the \"friction phase\", wherein the groups were entered in competition with one another in various camp games. Valued prizes were awarded to the winners. This caused both groups to develop negative attitudes and behaviors towards the outgroup. The third and final stage was the \"integration stage\". During this stage, tensions between the groups were reduced through teamwork-driven tasks that required intergroup cooperation.\n\nThe Sherifs made several conclusions based on the three-stage Robbers Cave Experiment. From the study, he determined that because the groups were created to be approximately equal, individual differences are not necessary or responsible for intergroup conflict to occur. As seen in the study when the boys were competing in camp games for valued prizes, Sherif noted that hostile and aggressive attitudes toward an outgroup arise when groups compete for resources that only one group can attain. Sherif also establishes that contact with an outgroup is insufficient, by itself, to reduce negative attitudes. Finally, he concludes that friction between groups can be reduced along with positive intergroup relations maintained, only in the presence of superordinate goals that promote united, cooperative action.\n\nHowever a further review of the Robber's Cave Experiments, which were in fact a series of three separate experiments carried out by the Sherifs and colleagues reveals additional deliberations. In two earlier studies the boys ganged up on a common enemy, and in fact on occasion ganged up on the experimenters themselves showing an awareness of being manipulated. In addition, Michael Billig argues that in addition to the two groups of boys, the experimenters themselves form a third group, and one that is arguably the most powerful of the three and that they in fact become the outgroup themselves in the aforementioned experiment. \n\nLutfy Diab repeated the experiment with 18 boys from Beirut. The 'Blue Ghost' and 'Red Genies' groups each contained 5 Christians and 4 Muslims. Fighting soon broke out, not Christian vs Muslim but Blue vs Red. \n\nRCT offers an explanation for negative attitudes toward racial integration and efforts to promote diversity. This is illustrated in the data collected from the Michigan National Election Studies survey. According to the survey, most whites held negative attitudes toward school districts' attempts to integrate schools via school busing in the 1970s. In these surveys, there was a general perceived threat that whites had of African Americans. It can be concluded that, contempt towards racial integration was due to a perception of blacks as a danger to valued lifestyles, goals, and resources, rather than symbolic racism or prejudice attitudes formulated during childhood.\n\nRCT can also provide an explanation for why competition over limited resources in communities can present potentially harmful consequences in establishing successful organizational diversity. In the workplace, this is depicted by the concept that increased racial heterogeneity among employees is associated with job dissatisfaction among majority members. Since organizations are affixed in the communities to which their employees belong, the racial makeup of employees' communities affect attitudes toward diversity in the workplace. As racial heterogeneity increases in a white community, white employees are less accepting of workplace diversity. RCT provides an explanation of this pattern because in communities of mixed races, members of minority groups are seen as competing for economic security, power, and prestige with the majority group.\n\nRCT can help explain discrimination against different ethnic and racial groups. An example of this is shown in cross-cultural studies that determined that violence between different groups escalates in relationship to shortages in resources. When a group have a notion that resources are limited and only available for possession by one group, this leads to attempts to remove the source of competition. Groups can attempt to remove their competition by increasing their groups capabilities (e.g. skill training), decreasing the abilities of the outgroups competition (e.g. expressing negative attitudes or applying punitive tariffs), or by decreasing proximity to the outgroup (e.g. denying immigrant access).\n\nRealistic conflict theory originally only described the results of competition between two groups of equal status. John Duckitt suggests that the theory be expanded to include competition between groups of unequal status. To demonstrate this, Duckitt created a scheme of types of realistic conflict with groups of unequal status and their resulting correlation with prejudice.\n\nDuckitt concluded that there are at least two types of conflict based on ingroups competition with an outgroup. The first is 'competition with an equal group' and is explained by realistic conflict theory. Thus being, group-based threat that leads ingroup members to feel hostile towards the outgroup which can lead to conflict as the ingroup focuses on acquiring the threatened resource. The second type of conflict is 'domination of the outgroup by the ingroup'. This occurs when the ingroup and outgroup do not have equal status. If domination occurs, there are two responses the subordinate group may have. One is stable oppression, in which the subordinate group accepts the dominating group's attitudes on some focal issue and sometimes, the dominant group's deeper values to avoid further conflict. The second response that may occur is unstable oppression. This occurs when the subordinate group rejects the lower status forced upon them, and sees the dominating group as oppressive. The dominant group then may view the subordinates' challenge as either justified or unjustified. If it is seen as unjustified, the dominant group will likely respond to the subordinates' rebellion with hostility. If the subordinates' rebellion is viewed as justified, the subordinates are given the power to demand change. An example of this would be the eventual recognition of the civil rights movement in the 1960s in the United States.\n\nWhen group conflict extends to nations or tribes, regality theory argues that the collective danger leads citizens to start having strong feelings of national or tribal identity, preferring strong, hierarchical political system, adopting strict discipline and punishment of deviants, and expressing xenophobia and strict religious and sexual morality.\n\n\n"}

Some coins, such as United States quarters and dimes, 1 euro, Australian 5, 10, 20 cents, 1 and 2 dollars, as well many other current coins, have reeded edges. One reason for having reeded edges was to prevent counterfeiting. Some gold and silver coins were reeded to discourage clipping, i.e. scraping off the precious metals from the edge of the coin, to maintain its stated value in precious metal. Another benefit of certain coins having reeded edges is that it helps enable different coin denominations to be easily identified and distinguished from each other by sense of touch alone.\n\nIn furniture, reeding is sometimes used around bedposts, and the legs of tables and chairs. Its use in this fashion was inspired by Greek and Roman architectural styles, and is the opposite of fluting.\n\nIn architecture, reeding is a form of molding usually found on columns, and is sometimes considered to be synonymous with gadrooning.\n\n"}

Frameworks with connections of intermediate stiffness will be intermediate between these two extremes. Frameworks with connections of intermediate stiffness are commonly called semirigid frames. The AISC specifications recognize three basic frame types: Rigid Frame, Simple Frame, and Partially Restrained Frame.\n\nThe AISC Steel Specification Commentary on Section B3 provides guidance for the classification of a connection in terms of its rigidity.

{"id": "5022223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5022223", "title": "Silent Hill: Homecoming", "text": "Silent Hill: Homecoming\n\nSilent Hill: Homecoming is a survival horror video game, the sixth installment in the \"Silent Hill\" series, developed by Double Helix Games. \"Homecoming\" follows the journey of Alex Shepherd, a soldier returning from war, to his hometown of Shepherd's Glen, where he finds the town in disarray, and his younger brother missing. As he continues on his search to find his younger brother, he discovers more about the Order, a cult, as well as the town's history, and his own past.\n\nThe game was released on September 30, 2008, in North America for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and the Microsoft Windows version was released in North America on November 6, 2008, exclusively through Valve Corporation's Steam digital content delivery service. All versions were simultaneously released in Europe, including a retail Microsoft Windows version, on February 27, 2009. The Japanese version was cancelled.\n\nThe player assumes the role of Alex Shepherd, a Special Forces soldier who returns home from an overseas tour of duty to find that his father and younger brother are missing, and that his mother has gone into catatonia. Alex begins to search for his brother, leading him to Silent Hill after searching his hometown of Shepherd's Glen.\n\nOverall gameplay is similar to past entries in the series. The player, as Alex, explores the various environments and locales, searching for clues to advance the plot, such as photographs, drawings and other items which are placed inside Alex's journal, which the player may read at any time. To assist the player, Alex will turn his head towards items and clues to inform the player that the object may be picked up; other recurring items include weapons and ammunition, which give off a glow as a visual cue to the player, and health drinks. Puzzle elements also play a part in the game, and Alex's journal may be used to refer to photographs and other items that can help the player decipher such puzzles as keypad entries. For the first time in the series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.\n\nIn addition to exploration, combat is another major element to the gameplay, and the player must fight the various monsters that appear. In contrast to the more naïve everyman protagonists of previous games, combat in \"Homecoming\" takes into account Alex's experience as a soldier. The player is able to perform light and heavy attacks, or mix them to perform combinations, and may also perform a variety of finishing moves to ensure that the monsters are dead, a gameplay mechanic first featured in a rudimentary form in \"\". Attacking enemies also leaves wounds in them that match the motion carried out by Alex in inflicting the attack. In terms of controlling Alex, the player may also perform new maneuvers such as targeting the enemy before attacking them, dodging enemy attacks, and performing counter-attacks. As well as melee weapons, pistols, rifles and shotguns are available as firearms, which can be upgraded to stronger versions later in the game: firearm handling is also rendered in a more realistic manner, with Alex having to shoulder long guns and suffering aim effects like recoil. In addition to the changes in combat, and unlike previous entries in the series, the player is also able to fully control and rotate the camera as they choose; one analog stick controls player movement, and the other controls the camera.\n\nAt the start of the game, the player controls Alex through a nightmare concerning his younger brother, Josh, before Alex wakes up in the cab of a truck driven by Travis Grady, the protagonist from \"\", who gives him a ride to his hometown of Shepherd's Glen. The town, named for a distant ancestor who helped found it, is covered in fog and deserted. At home, he finds his mother in a catatonic state, murmuring about his father leaving to find Josh; promising to find Josh, Alex leaves.\n\nAlex soon discovers that many more people have gone missing in Shepherd's Glen since he left when he finds his childhood friend Elle Holloway pinning \"missing\" signs to a board outside the police department. As Alex explores the town, he witnesses the separate deaths of Mayor Bartlett and Dr. Fitch by monsters in the Otherworld, both of whom have a child who is missing. Back in Shepherd's Glen, Alex allies himself with Deputy Wheeler in the police department. Alex eventually learns that his father was involved in the secrets of the town and had left to attempt to resolve the town's problems, but before he is able to get answers from his mother at home, he is knocked unconscious when The Order—a religious cult from Silent Hill which has been taking people from the town— kidnaps his mother.\n\nAlex, Elle, and Wheeler take a boat across Toluca Lake to find Alex's father in Silent Hill but are intercepted by the Order. Elle and Wheeler are taken to Silent Hill's penitentiary, where Alex attempts to rescue them. He finds his mother bound; the player must make a decision regarding whether to kill her out of mercy or not, which will affect the outcome of the game. After rescuing Elle's mother, Judge Holloway, and separating from Wheeler once more, Alex finds the Order's church, where he listens to his father in the confessional; the player may choose to forgive him, again affecting the outcome of the game. Alex later runs into his father, who reveals that Alex was never a soldier and has been in a mental hospital since \"the accident\" occurred. He begs forgiveness before he is killed by a monster called the Bogeyman (resembling Pyramid Head from \"Silent Hill 2\").\n\nContinuing to the Order's underground facility, Alex is captured by Judge Holloway, who reveals that everything that has happened is due to a broken pact. One hundred and fifty years ago, the four founding families broke away from Silent Hill's Order to move to Shepherd's Glen. They were allowed to do so on the condition that once every 50 years they would sacrifice one of their children in a preordained fashion. On this occasion, while Joey Bartlett, Scarlett Fitch and Nora Holloway were successfully sacrificed by their parents, the Shepherd sacrifice failed, and as a result, the Order had been reformed to try to appease their god. Judge Holloway tries to kill Alex, who kills her in self-defense. Alex rescues Elle from the facility and, after finding Wheeler injured and allowing the player to choose whether to save him—once more affecting the game's ending—continues on alone to find Josh.\n\nRealizing he was the intended sacrifice, Alex experiences a flashback showing Josh's true fate. When Alex was younger, he had taken Josh rowing out on the lake, where Josh showed Alex a ring, which his father had chosen to give to him instead of Alex. Out of jealousy, Alex struggled with Josh to try to take the ring, and as they fought Josh accidentally fell into the lake and drowned. His father retrieved the body and explained that Alex had \"ruined it for all of us\", since he had chosen Alex, and not Josh; unable to accept Josh's death, Alex was then sent to the mental hospital, and with Josh instead of Alex sacrificed, the Order's pact was broken. After fighting the final boss, the manifestation of Josh's spirit, Alex finally has the chance to apologize and states that he never wanted Josh's death. Alex leaves the family ring and their father's angle-head army flashlight on Josh's body and exits the chamber.\n\nThere are five endings available, which depend on the player's actions during the game, including whether the player kills Alex's mother, forgives Alex's father, and saves Deputy Wheeler. These range from the single positive ending to the game—where Alex comes to terms with his past actions and reunites with Elle to leave Shepherd's Glen—to three other endings: Alex getting drowned by his father, waking up in the hospital and receiving a shock treatment, or being turned into a Bogeyman. There is also a joke ending, where both Alex and Elle are abducted by a UFO while Wheeler witnesses. In addition to these endings, if the player collects all of Josh's pictures or clears the game on the \"hard\" difficulty, a first-person post-credits scene is played where Alex finds Josh sitting on the bottom bunk of his bed and Josh takes a picture of Alex with a camera.\n\nChief designer of \"Silent Hill: Homecoming\", Masashi Tsuboyama, announced the game's development in a 2004 interview with Eurogamer, in which he also debunked previous internet rumors that it was to be called \"Shadows of the Past\". No information was initially imparted about the platform the game would appear on, other than it would be appearing on the next generation of consoles, which had yet to be released. Around two years later, an interview with composer Akira Yamaoka revealed more information; he hinted that they had hoped to carry on \"plans of the earlier Silent Hill platforms\", and that the team were creating a title with the idea of \"fear in daylight\", with similar psychological roots to \"Silent Hill 2\". The suggestion that the story and gameplay would be more like that of the second entry in the series in the way the player is directed, and in the character's behavior, was reaffirmed in a later interview, along with the idea of creating the game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms.\n\nHowever, most of the ideas previously hinted at were not found in subsequent information releases. At E3 2007, a new teaser trailer was displayed by Konami that revealed the title of the game to be \"Silent Hill V\", and that the game would be released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Further to this trailer, Konami executives also revealed that the developer would not in fact be Team Silent as in previous iterations, but that, like \"Silent Hill: Origins\", it would be developed by a Western developer, The Collective. The Collective had merged with Backbone Entertainment in 2005 to form Foundation 9 Entertainment, and Foundation 9 then merged The Collective with Shiny Entertainment to create Double Helix Games. The team had been working on the production of \"Harker\", another survival horror title, but this was placed on indefinite hiatus during \"Homecoming\"'s production.\n\nDouble Helix drew inspiration not only from past installments in the game series but also from the first \"Silent Hill\" movie adaptation; this is most evident in the transition from the normal world to the Otherworld, whose \"ripping\" effect almost matches that found in the movie. Other similarities from the same source includes the reaction of nurses to light, the bug-like creatures seen in the movie, and the Pyramid Head rendition, known as the \"Bogeyman\" in this game. Homages to previous games in the series include a reference to the long-running joke of the lead character placing their hand in a toilet bowl to retrieve items. Lead designer Jason Allen described the intentions of the development team to be to maintain the depth of storytelling and atmosphere of the series whilst making combat more intuitive and less frustrating. The script, in-game journal entries, and instruction manual were written by Patrick J. Doody and Chris Valenziano, based on the story and the summary of events provided by lead designer Jason Allen, lead artist Brian Horton, and lead level designer Daniel Jacobs.\n\nDespite the change in development team, Akira Yamaoka returned from past installments in the series to create both music and sound effects for the game. It was the first game in the series to use surround sound. Yamaoka wrote 70 minutes of music for the game, and insisted on working with Mary Elizabeth McGlynn to provide vocals, as fan reaction to her voice on previous Silent Hill titles has been favorable. \"Homecoming\"s soundtrack was released on November 24, 2008. McGlynn provided vocals for four tracks.\n\n\"Homecoming\" had difficulties in passing censors in some countries before it could go on sale. The Australian classification board, the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC), refused to classify the game, due to \"impact violence and excessive blood effects\". The objectionable scenes included various body parts being drilled into, as well as the bisection of a character by an enemy. This had the effect of banning the game for sale in the country, and representatives for publisher Atari mentioned that they would be asking Konami to tone down the violence to allow the game to receive the needed MA15+ rating for its sale to be permitted in early 2009.\n\nThe German version of the game was also postponed to 2009 for cuts to be made to pass the German censors after the uncensored version was rejected by the Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle. The game was re-submitted after being altered in the same way as the Australian version and received the highest rating possible as a result (\"Freigegeben ab 18 Jahren gemäß § 14 JuSchG\", meaning 18+).\n\nOn November 19, 2010, the Amtsgericht Frankfurt am Main confiscated all Xbox 360 versions imported from the UK (thus being uncensored) for violation of (representation of violence), effectively banning it from sale within Germany.\n\n\"Homecoming\" was released in North America on September 30, 2008, for both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. The PC version, which in North America, Central America and South America is only available via the Steam content delivery network, because it was intended to launch on the same date as the console versions, but was delayed, finally becoming available on Steam on November 6, 2008. A European release on all platforms was intended for the same month, but the title was delayed in the region to February 2009. In contrast to the American regions, a PC retail release on DVD was made available in Europe.\n\n\"Homecoming\"s average at Metacritic is 71 out of 100 for the PS3 version, 70 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version and 64 out of 100 for the PC version. As the second external developer working on a Silent Hill entry, and the first for a home console iteration, Double Helix were under scrutiny from reviewers and \"Silent Hill\" fans to see how a Western developer would handle the franchise; many reviewers found the change in developer to be a positive move overall, while some, acknowledging faults in the final product, expressed interest in seeing further \"Silent Hill\" games from the same developer. In contrast, Zero Punctuation commented that the game was as an example of Japanese franchises being downgraded by Westernization, particularly in the different approaches taken to induce fear in the player.\n\nPraise was given to the graphics and environments, described as \"fantastic\", with Shepherd's Glen in particular being \"rendered brilliantly\", and \"the upgraded visuals bestow a filmic quality to everything and the world's eerie transformations look better than ever.\" Surprise was expressed at the darkness of the game, with the flashlight seemingly having less effect than in previous games, and making some markers, such as doors, hard to spot.\n\nThe music, written by series regular Akira Yamaoka, and the ambient audio, were received well, being \"atmospheric, moody and beautifully presented\"; combined with \"an amazing score\", the audio goes \"a long way toward establishing the expected Silent Hill mood\", though some concern was expressed that the music was \"somewhat misplaced\" and did not fit in so well. Voice acting, which has traditionally been seen as one of the series' weaker points, was evaluated as better than the series' usual attempts, but occasionally \"flat\" when more emotion was needed.\n\nThe game's plot received a largely mixed reception. While some reviewers graded it positively, describing it as \"intriguing and disturbing\", it was also noted that it \"isn't particularly original, and there are no great surprises\", even though it \"still makes for a very involving journey into the macabre.\" Several reviewers likened the story to a subplot of the main \"Silent Hill\" mythos which, while able to \"stand on its own\", \"barely mentions certain characters which fairly dominate the backstory of previous SH games.\" Some critics expressed disappointment at the predictability of the main twist in the story regarding Alex's predicament, while others found it \"genuinely shocking\". Croshaw's Zero Punctuation review was generally negative, stating that while the level design, story and combat were all competent, the game had little to do with what he liked about the \"Silent Hill\" series and would have been better served as a completely different franchise.\n"}
{"id": "9527179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9527179", "title": "Singkil", "text": "Singkil\n\nSingkíl (or Sayaw sa Kasingkil) is a folk dance of the Maranao people of Lake Lanao based on the epic legend \"Darangen\". which was popularised by the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company.\n\n\"Singkil\" originated from the Maranao people who inhabit the shores of Lake Lanao. It is a re-telling of an episode from the Maranao epic legend \"Darangen\" involving the rescue of Princess Gandingan (abducted by the \"diwatas\") by the legendary Prince Bantugan. It is a popular dance performed during celebrations and other festive entertainment. Originally only women, particularly royalty, danced the \"Singkil\", which serves as either a conscious or unconscious advertisement to potential suitors. The dance takes its name from the heavy rings worn on the ankles of the Muslim princess. A \"kulintang\" and \"agung\" ensemble always accompanies the dance.\n\nThe female lead dancer plays the role of Princess Gandingan of the \"Darangen\" epic, wearing the heavy rings around her ankles to keep time while she dances. In an episode of the Maranao epic, the princess is caught in the middle of the forest during an earthquake caused by the \"diwatas\" (or the guardian spirits) of the Kingdom of Bumbaran. The \"diwatas\" abducted the princess and entrapped her into a forest to teach the philandering Prince Bantugan a lesson. The falling trees during the earthquake (which the princess gracefully avoids) are represented by the bamboo poles arranged in a criss-crossed fashion and clacked together in a unique, syncopated rhythm. During the performance, the female lead dancer graciously steps in and out of the bamboo poles as she manipulates two elaborately designed fans called \"apir\". Another female dancer represents the loyal slave of the princess who accompanies her throughout the ordeal. After a while, a male dancer, representing the legendary Prince Bantugan of the \"Darangen\" epic, performs his dance round and through the bamboo poles clacked together bearing a shield and a sword. The entrance of the male dancer symbolizes the arrival of Prince Bantugan who is determined to rescue the princess from the \"diwatas\". Other dancers skillfully manipulate the \"apir\" fans, which represent the winds which prove to be auspicious. The dance steps require agile movement so that the dancer's feet won't be crushed by the moving bamboos. Meanwhile, the clacking bamboo poles represent the forces which the two characters had to overcome. The dance ends with the princess going home with the prince.\n\nWhen the Bayanihan Dance Company began performing the \"Singkíl\", the traditional dance was adapted to convey Western aesthetics. The Bayanihan portrayal, branded as the \"Princess Dance\" or the \"Royal Maranao Fan Dance\", became so popular that it is often mistaken for the authentic version of the dance.\n\nA notable variation from the original is its inclusion of male dancers, as pole clappers and in the role of the Prince, Rajah Bantugan. Additional sets of criss-crossing bamboo poles were also added.\n\nFurther adaptation divided the dance into four movements: \n\nPCN (Pilipino Cultural Night) festivities held by foreign-based student groups and other theatrical dance companies have modernised interpretations of the dance, resulting in unorthodox portrayals of the \"Singkíl\" by even the most esteemed of Philippine folk dance choreographers.\n\nThe Philippine Barangay Folkdance Troupe portrays the prince dancing scarves rather than with a sword and a shield.\n\nSome dance companies have even fused the \"Singkíl\" with ballet, or make use of multiple layers of overlapping bamboos.\n\nThe \"Singkíl\" was performed in the 2001 American independent film \"The Debut\". The movie was directed by Filipino American filmmaker Gene Cajayon and starred Dante Basco. The film captured the essence of Filipino traditions and the blending of these with modern American culture.\n\n"}
{"id": "2297237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297237", "title": "Small schools movement", "text": "Small schools movement\n\nThe small schools movement, also known as the Small Schools Initiative, in the United States of America holds that many high schools are too large and should be reorganized into smaller, autonomous schools of no more than 400 students, and optimally under 200. Many private schools of under 200 share design features which draw upon the benefits of organizations of less than 200 people. In the public school version of the Small Schools Movement, students may be given a choice of which small school they want to join. Each of the smaller schools would offer students a feeling of connectedness between students who share the same or similar interests with them. In many ways, the small schools in high schools would resemble the team system of many middle schools across the United States. Small schools allow students to have more individual attention from teachers than most average high schools. Many small schools are created by reforming a failed large school into several small ones in the same building, as is the case with the former Theodore Roosevelt High School in the Bronx in New York City.\n\nSupporters of small schools claim that \"in small schools, student achievement increases... Student attendance improves, graduation rates rise, and college going rates increase. Students are more engaged in their studies and are more likely to participate in extracurricular activities.\" This is due to the fact that students are more likely to be known by all of the adults and children in the school and are much less likely to \"fall through the cracks.\"\n\nDeborah Meier has argued that a small school allows all of the teachers to sit around a single table and to create a culture of shared decision-making. This should be a central component of a school that intends to teach children to become powerful members of a democracy--they should see their teachers acting democratically. Face-to-face democracy is much more likely and practical in a small school.\n\nPositive gains for student achievement within small schools can be seen in Oakland California. According to a study by the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University \"small schools in Oakland are outperforming the large schools from which they emerged. In particular, students are completing more rigorous coursework and dropping out at lower rates, compared to the large schools.\" \n\nAccording to \"The American Dream and the Public Schools\" by Jennifer L. Hochschild and Nathan Scovronick, smaller classes sizes contribute to students in \"early grades, and consistently challenging academic courses have been demonstrated to help disadvantaged\nchildren achieve, just as they enable middle-class children to achieve.\" \n\n\"Smaller, more intimate learning communities consistently deliver better results in academics and discipline when compared to their larger counterparts. Big schools offer few opportunities to participate.\" \"Students at large schools are more prone to be alienated from their peers or engage in risky behavior.\" \n\nOther benefits of small schools are noted in a study conducted by UCLA stating that \"at their best, small schools are seen as enhancing strong personal bonds, home and community involvement, improved instructional quality and accountability, and improved teacher working conditions and job satisfaction.\"\n\nLeading small schools proponent and founder of the Small Schools Coalition and the Grauer School Dr. Stuart Grauer notes, \"Research shows overwhelmingly that small schools lead to greater student academic gains and personal adjustment. In fact, data justifying this has been available for decades; it's just that policy makers have largely ignored it, no doubt due to the costs of such programs (and, of course, the politics). Right now, armed guards, metal detectors, and expulsions fail to get to the heart of the problem. (To a serious extent, they can actually create repressive conditions which make the problem worse.) Consequently, many people are looking for another way, and small schools can't be ignored much longer.\" Why do we keep building gigantic schools when we have such promising data? Dr. Grauer attributes this not only to economics, but to prevailing myths about American education: \"Our collective memory of high school includes nostalgia such as proms, football games, exciting social lives, romance, and first cars. No matter that such memories do not apply to most students. The average high school student does not attend sporting events; indeed the larger the school, the smaller the percentage of student participation in these activities. For most students, the social scene in large high schools is tough and unforgiving, with sharp distinctions made between the small group of social haves and the far larger masses of have-nots. And high school memories seldom include a significant academic component, let alone an intellectual one ( 2001). In other words, many high schools have activities that everyone speaks of with pride—sacred cows like the marching band, the lacrosse team, the boosters. These untouchable activities represent the school's image, and they can't be changed, even though they serve a very small percentage of students and rarely have any connection to the most basic thing of all: the focus on student learning.\"\n\nSmall schools are gaining popularity in the United States not only with students, but with donors as well. According to the Neal Peirce Column of the Washington Post Writers Group, \"far and away the biggest catalyst is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It has poured over $1 billion in five years into promoting smaller schools in Boston, Chicago, Milwaukee and other cities. Just this month New York City announced it was coming on board the small schools movement. It will open 60 schools with 500 students or less -- 41 high schools, four traditional middle schools and 15 based on an innovative sixth- or seventh-through-12th grade model.\" \n\nResearch and the growing data on small schools have provided some evidence regarding their better academic quality in comparison to their larger counterparts.\n\nAccording to Dr. Sharif Shakrani, the co-director of the Education Policy Center at Michigan State University, \"Recent studies suggest students in small public high schools perform better academically, have higher attendance rates, feel safer, experience fewer behavior problems and participate more frequently in extracurricular activities.\" \n\nShakrani also states that \"a number of empirical articles document that students in small public and private high schools have higher achievement levels than those in large schools. Studies found higher student gains in reading, mathematics, science and social studies at small high schools than at large schools. Moreover, small schools are more likely to have fewer incidents of violence and misbehavior and that, in turn, has been found to contribute to higher attendance and lower drop-out and truancy rates.\" \n\nSmall schools tend to emerge, particularly in urban areas, where there is a need for education reform due to failing school systems. High quality small public schools act as a remedy to large public schools that are falling behind in their ability to graduate students, achieve higher test scores and provide students with individual attention. The small school movement has modeled its efforts after small private schools which provide a similar learning environment which is based upon providing for the needs of their students.\n\nMany criticisms stem from the fact that the term \"small school\" is not uniform. For instance, schools of between 400 and 1200 students are often researched as small schools despite having few of the attributes of small schools (e.g., a community of 200 or less, class size of less than 15, and similar criteria often applied).\nHence, they point out that large schools tend to have a wider diversity of course offerings, as well as more clubs, arts programs, higher performing sports teams, and other extracurricular activities such as school newspapers and social events. Small schools advocates point out that in schools of less than 400 and especially less than 230, students have more access to enrichment and leadership programs. Some schools have abandoned the small school approach after failures to overcome these difficulties, even after being offered grants to continue these experiments. Other districts have expanded this movement by shutting down large schools and opening more smaller ones. The Gates Foundation, which supports and funds small schools, is beginning to change its focus to working directly on improving instruction, giving grants to improve math and science instruction, for example.\n\n\n"}

Sport tourism is a fast-growing sector of the global travel industry and equates to $7.68 billion.\n\nThere are several classifications of sport tourism. Gammon and Robinson suggested that sports tourism can be categorized as \"Hard Sports Tourism\" or \"Soft Sports Tourism\", while Gibson suggested that there are three types of sports tourism: \"Sports Event Tourism\", \"Celebrity and Nostalgia Sport Tourism\" and \"Active Sport Tourism\".\n\nThe \"hard\" definition of sport tourism refers to the quantity of people participating at a competitive sport events. Normally these kinds of events are the motivation that attract visitors to the events. Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup, F1 Grand Prix and regional events such as NASCAR Sprint Cup Series could be described as hard sports tourism.\n\nThe \"soft\" definition of sport tourism is when the tourist travels to participate in recreational sporting, or signing up for leisure interests. Hiking, skiing, running and canoeing can be described as soft sports tourism. Perhaps the most common form of soft sports tourism involves golf in regards to destinations in Europe and the United States. A large number of people are interested in playing some of the world's greatest and highest ranked courses, and take great pride in checking those destinations off of their list of places to visit.\n\n\"Sports event tourism\" refers to the visitors who visit a city to watch events. The two events that attract the most tourists worldwide are the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup. These events hold once every four years, in a different city in the world. Sport tourism in the United States is more focused on events that happen annually. The major event for the National Football League is the Super Bowl, held at the end of the year in different city every year. Even though the National Hockey League started the annual NHL Winter Classic game in 2008, the 2014 New Year's outdoor hockey game rivaled the Stanley Cup Tournament in popularity and \"revitalized the NHL\". As of 2015, the newest trend in college basketball was to start the season off with annual tournaments such as the Maui Invitational held in Hawaii, and the Battle for Atlantis which is played in the Bahamas. This idea of pairing quality sports events with the Bahamas attractions raised the island's profile and brought in more visitors and dollars to the country. The Battle for Atlantis brought more than 5,000 fans in during Thanksgiving week for the three-day tournament. The event helped increase hotel capacity from what is typically around 60 percent this time of year to 90 percent. Sport tourism \"is a growing market and many different cities and countries want to be involved,”\n\n\"Celebrity and nostalgia sport tourism\" involves \"visits to the sports halls of fame and venue\" and \"meeting sports personalities in a vacation basis\".\n\n\"Active sport tourism\" refers to those who participate in the sports or sport events. Rugby football, football, basketball, etc are considered active sports and many sport events (which we call tournaments or festivals) are organized each year in most of the countries in the world.\n\n"}

{"id": "24311613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24311613", "title": "Telephone phobia", "text": "Telephone phobia\n\nTelephone phobia (telephonophobia, telephobia, phone phobia) is reluctance or fear of making or taking phone calls, literally, \"fear of telephones\". It is considered to be a type of social phobia or social anxiety. It may be compared to glossophobia, in that both arise from having to engage with an audience, and the associated fear of being criticized, judged or made a fool of.\n\nAs is common with other fears and phobias, there is a wide spectrum of severity of the fear of phone conversations and corresponding difficulties. In 1993 it was reported that about 2.5 million people in Great Britain have telephone phobia.\n\nThe term \"telephone apprehension\" refers to a lower degree of telephone phobia, in which sufferers experience anxiety about the use of telephones, but to a less severe degree than that of an actual phobia.\n\nSufferers may have no problem communicating face to face, but have difficulty doing so over the telephone.\n\nA fear of receiving calls may range from fear of the action or thought of answering the phone to fear of its actual ringing. The ringing can generate a string of anxieties, characterized by thoughts associated with having to speak, perform and converse. Sufferers may perceive the other end as threatening or intimidating. Anxiety may be triggered by concerns that the caller may bear bad or upsetting news, or be a prank caller.\n\nFear of making calls may be associated with concerns about finding an appropriate time to call, in fear of being a nuisance. A sufferer calling a household or office in which they know several people may be concerned at the prospect of failing to recognize the voice of the person who answers, with resultant embarrassment. Some sufferers may be anxious about having to \"perform\" in front of a real or perceived audience at their end of the line: this is a particular problem for those required to use a phone in the workplace.\n\nFear of using the phone in any context (for either making or receiving calls) may be associated with anxiety about poor sound quality, and concerns that one or other party will not understand what has been said, resulting either in misunderstandings, or in the need for repetition, further explanation, or other potentially awkward forms of negotiation. These fears are often linked to the absence of body language over a phone line, and the individual fearing a loss of their sense of control. Sufferers typically report fear that they might fail to respond appropriately in the conversation, or find themselves with nothing to say, leading to embarrassing silence, stammering, or stuttering. Past experiences, such as receiving traumatic news, or enduring an unpleasant and angry call, may also play a part in creating fear.\n\nA variety of symptoms can be seen in someone suffering from telephone phobia, many of which are shared with anxiety. These symptoms may include nervous stomach, sweaty palms, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, nausea, dry mouth and trembling. The sufferer may experience feelings of panic, terror and dread. Resulting panic attacks can include hyperventilation and stress. These negative and agitating symptoms can be produced by both the thought of making and receiving calls and the action of doing so.\n\nThe telephone is important for both contacting others and accessing important and useful services. As a result, this phobia causes a great deal of stress and impacts people's personal lives, work lives and social lives. Sufferers avoid many activities, such as scheduling events or clarifying information. Strain is created in the workplace because use of phones may play a crucial role within a career.\n\nCoping strategies may consist of planning the conversation ahead of time and rehearsing, writing or noting down what needs to be said. Anxiety may be lessened by having privacy in which to make a call, so that the sufferer need not be concerned about the conversation being overheard.\n\nAssociated avoidance behavior may include asking others (e.g. relatives at home) to take phone calls and exclusively using answering machines. The rise in the use of electronic text-based communication (the Internet, email and text messaging) has given many sufferers alternative means of communication that they may find considerably less stressful than the phone. However, some individuals experience \"textphobia\", a fear or anxiety of texting or messaging, and also avoid those forms of communication.\n\nSufferers may find it helpful to explain the nature of the phobia to friends, so that a failure to respond to messages is not misinterpreted as rudeness or an unwillingness to communicate.\n\nPhobias of this sort can usually be treated by different types of therapies, including: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychotherapy, behavior therapy and exposure therapy.\n\nPractice may play an important part in overcoming fear. It may be helpful to sufferers to increase phone usage at a slow pace, starting with simple calls and gradually working their way up. For example, they may find it easier to start with automated calls, move on to conversations with family and friends, and then further extend both the length of conversations and the range of people with whom conversations are held.\n\n"}
{"id": "155023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155023", "title": "Textual criticism", "text": "Textual criticism\n\nTextual criticism is a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism that is concerned with the identification of textual variants in either manuscripts or printed books. Scribes can make alterations when copying manuscripts by hand. Given a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document, the textual critic might seek to reconstruct the original text (urtext, archetype or autograph) as closely as possible. The same processes can be used to attempt to reconstruct intermediate versions, or recensions, of a document's transcription history. The objective of the textual critic's work is a better understanding of the creation and historical transmission of texts. This understanding may lead to the production of a \"critical edition\" containing a scholarly curated text.\n\nThere are many approaches to textual criticism, notably eclecticism, stemmatics, and copy-text editing. Quantitative techniques are also used to determine the relationships between witnesses to a text, with methods from evolutionary biology (phylogenetics) appearing effective on a range of traditions.\n\nIn some domains (religious and classical text editing) the phrase \"lower criticism\" is used to describe the contrast between textual criticism and \"higher criticism\", which is the endeavor to establish the authorship, date, and place of composition of the original text.\n\nTextual criticism has been practiced for over two thousand years. Early textual critics, especially the librarians of Hellenistic Alexandria in the last two centuries BC, were concerned with preserving the works of antiquity, and this continued through the medieval period into early modern times and the invention of the printing press. Textual criticism was an important aspect of the work of many Renaissance Humanists, such as Desiderius Erasmus, who edited the Greek New Testament, creating the \"Textus Receptus\". In Italy, scholars such as Petrarch and Poggio Bracciolini collected and edited many Latin manuscripts, while a new spirit of critical enquiry was boosted by the attention to textual states, for example in the work of Lorenzo Valla on the purported Donation of Constantine.\n\nMany ancient works, such as the Bible and the Greek tragedies, survive in hundreds of copies, and the relationship of each copy to the original may be unclear. Textual scholars have debated for centuries which sources are most closely derived from the original, hence which readings in those sources are correct. Although biblical books that are letters, like Greek plays, presumably had one original, the question of whether some biblical books, like the Gospels, ever had just one original has been discussed. Interest in applying textual criticism to the Quran has also developed after the discovery of the Sana'a manuscripts in 1972, which possibly date back to the 7–8th centuries.\n\nIn the English language, the works of Shakespeare have been a particularly fertile ground for textual criticism—both because the texts, as transmitted, contain a considerable amount of variation, and because the effort and expense of producing superior editions of his works have always been widely viewed as worthwhile.\nThe principles of textual criticism, although originally developed and refined for works of antiquity and the Bible, and, for Anglo-American Copy-Text editing, Shakespeare,\nhave been applied to many works, from (near-)contemporary texts to the earliest known written documents. Ranging from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt to the twentieth century, textual criticism covers a period of about five millennia.\n\nThe basic problem, as described by Paul Maas, is as follows:\nMaas comments further that \"A dictation revised by the author must be regarded as equivalent to an autograph manuscript\". The lack of autograph manuscripts applies to many cultures other than Greek and Roman. In such a situation, a key objective becomes the identification of the first \"exemplar\" before any split in the tradition. That exemplar is known as the \"archetype\". \"If we succeed in establishing the text of [the archetype], the \"constitutio\" (reconstruction of the original) is considerably advanced.\n\nThe textual critic's ultimate objective is the production of a \"critical edition\". This contains the text that the author has determined most closely approximates the original, and is accompanied by an \"apparatus criticus\" or critical apparatus. The critical apparatus presents the author's work in three parts: first, a list or description of the evidence that the editor used (names of manuscripts, or abbreviations called sigla); second, the editor's analysis of that evidence (sometimes a simple likelihood rating),; and third, a record of rejected variants of the text (often in order of preference).\n\nBefore mechanical printing, literature was copied by hand, and many variations were introduced by copyists. The age of printing made the scribal profession effectively redundant. Printed editions, while less susceptible to the proliferation of variations likely to arise during manual transmission, are nonetheless not immune to introducing variations from an author's autograph. Instead of a scribe miscopying his source, a compositor or a printing shop may read or typeset a work in a way that differs from the autograph. Since each scribe or printer commits different errors, reconstruction of the lost original is often aided by a selection of readings taken from many sources. An edited text that draws from multiple sources is said to be \"eclectic\". In contrast to this approach, some textual critics prefer to identify the single best surviving text, and not to combine readings from multiple sources.\n\nWhen comparing different documents, or \"witnesses\", of a single, original text, the observed differences are called \"variant readings\", or simply \"variants\" or \"readings\". It is not always apparent which single variant represents the author's original work. The process of textual criticism seeks to explain how each variant may have entered the text, either by accident (duplication or omission) or intention (harmonization or censorship), as scribes or supervisors transmitted the original author's text by copying it. The textual critic's task, therefore, is to sort through the variants, eliminating those most likely to be \"un\"-original, hence establishing a \"critical text\", or critical edition, that is intended to best approximate the original. At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition. In establishing the critical text, the textual critic considers both \"external\" evidence (the age, provenance, and affiliation of each witness) and \"internal\" or \"physical\" considerations (what the author and scribes, or printers, were likely to have done).\n\nThe collation of all known variants of a text is referred to as a variorum, namely a work of textual criticism whereby all variations and emendations are set side by side so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication. The Bible and the works of William Shakespeare have often been the subjects of variorum editions, although the same techniques have been applied with less frequency to many other works, such as Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass,\nand the prose writings of Edward Fitzgerald.\n\nEclecticism refers to the practice of consulting a wide diversity of witnesses to a particular original. The practice is based on the principle that the more independent transmission histories there are, the less likely they will be to reproduce the same errors. What one omits, the others may retain; what one adds, the others are unlikely to add. Eclecticism allows inferences to be drawn regarding the original text, based on the evidence of contrasts between witnesses.\n\nEclectic readings also normally give an impression of the number of witnesses to each available reading. Although a reading supported by the majority of witnesses is frequently preferred, this does not follow automatically. For example, a second edition of a Shakespeare play may include an addition alluding to an event known to have happened between the two editions. Although nearly all subsequent manuscripts may have included the addition, textual critics may reconstruct the original without the addition.\n\nThe result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. It is not a copy of any particular manuscript, and may deviate from the majority of existing manuscripts. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence.\n\nSince the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no \"a priori\" bias to a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament (currently, the United Bible Society, 5th ed. and Nestle-Aland, 28th ed.). Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the Alexandrian text-type, are the most favored, and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition.\n\nExternal evidence is evidence of each physical witness, its date, source, and relationship to other known witnesses. Critics will often prefer the readings supported by the oldest witnesses. Since errors tend to accumulate, older manuscripts should have fewer errors. Readings supported by a majority of witnesses are also usually preferred, since these are less likely to reflect accidents or individual biases. For the same reasons, the most geographically diverse witnesses are preferred. Some manuscripts show evidence that particular care was taken in their composition, for example, by including alternative readings in their margins, demonstrating that more than one prior copy (exemplar) was consulted in producing the current one. Other factors being equal, these are the \"best\" witnesses. The role of the textual critic is necessary when these basic criteria are in conflict. For instance, there will typically be fewer early copies, and a larger number of later copies. The textual critic will attempt to balance these criteria, to determine the original text.\n\nThere are many other more sophisticated considerations. For example, readings that depart from the known practice of a scribe or a given period may be deemed more reliable, since a scribe is unlikely on his own initiative to have departed from the usual practice.\n\nInternal evidence is evidence that comes from the text itself, independent of the physical characteristics of the document. Various considerations can be used to decide which reading is the most likely to be original. Sometimes these considerations can be in conflict.\n\nTwo common considerations have the Latin names \"lectio brevior\" (shorter reading) and \"lectio difficilior\" (more difficult reading). The first is the general observation that scribes tended to add words, for clarification or out of habit, more often than they removed them. The second, \"lectio difficilior potior\" (the harder reading is stronger), recognizes the tendency for harmonization—resolving apparent inconsistencies in the text. Applying this principle leads to taking the more difficult (unharmonized) reading as being more likely to be the original. Such cases also include scribes simplifying and smoothing texts they did not fully understand.\n\nAnother scribal tendency is called homoioteleuton, meaning \"same endings\". Homoioteleuton occurs when two words/phrases/lines end with the same sequence of letters. The scribe, having finished copying the first, skips to the second, omitting all intervening words. \"Homeoarchy\" refers to eye-skip when the \"beginnings\" of two lines are similar.\n\nThe critic may also examine the other writings of the author to decide what words and grammatical constructions match his style. The evaluation of internal evidence also provides the critic with information that helps him evaluate the reliability of individual manuscripts. Thus, the consideration of internal and external evidence is related.\n\nAfter considering all relevant factors, the textual critic seeks the reading that best explains how the other readings would arise. That reading is then the most likely candidate to have been original.\n\nVarious scholars have developed guidelines, or \"canons\" of textual criticism, to guide the exercise of the critic's judgment in determining the best readings of a text. One of the earliest was Johann Albrecht Bengel (1687–1752), who in 1734 produced an edition of the Greek New Testament. In his commentary, he established the rule \"Proclivi scriptioni praestat ardua\", (\"the harder reading is to be preferred\").\n\nJohann Jakob Griesbach (1745–1812) published several editions of the New Testament. In his 1796 edition, he established fifteen critical rules. Among them was a variant of Bengel's rule, \"Lectio difficilior potior\", \"the harder reading is better.\" Another was \"Lectio brevior praeferenda\", \"the shorter reading is better\", based on the idea that scribes were more likely to add than to delete. This rule cannot be applied uncritically, as scribes may omit material inadvertently.\n\nBrooke Foss Westcott (1825–1901) and Fenton Hort (1828–1892) published an edition of the New Testament in Greek in 1881. They proposed nine critical rules, including a version of Bengel's rule, \"The reading is less likely to be original that shows a disposition to smooth away difficulties.\" They also argued that \"Readings are approved or rejected by reason of the quality, and not the number, of their supporting witnesses\", and that \"The reading is to be preferred that most fitly explains the existence of the others.\"\n\nMany of these rules, although originally developed for biblical textual criticism, have wide applicability to any text susceptible to errors of transmission.\n\nSince the canons of criticism are highly susceptible to interpretation, and at times even contradict each other, they may be employed to justify a result that fits the textual critic's aesthetic or theological agenda. Starting in the 19th century, scholars sought more rigorous methods to guide editorial judgment. Stemmatics and copy-text editing – while both eclectic, in that they permit the editor to select readings from multiple sources – sought to reduce subjectivity by establishing one or a few witnesses presumably as being favored by \"objective\" criteria. The citing of sources used, and alternate readings, and the use of original text and images helps readers and other critics determine to an extent the depth of research of the critic, and to independently verify their work.\n\nStemmatics or stemmatology is a rigorous approach to textual criticism. Karl Lachmann (1793–1851) greatly contributed to making this method famous, even though he did not invent it. The method takes its name from the word \"stemma\". The Ancient Greek word στέμματα and its loanword in classical Latin \"stemmata\" may refer to \"family trees\". This specific meaning shows the relationships of the surviving witnesses (the first known example of such a stemma, albeit with the name, dates from 1827).<ref>Collín, H. S. and C. J.

{"id": "593807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=593807", "title": "The Cyberiad", "text": "The Cyberiad\n\nThe Cyberiad () is a series of humorous science fiction short stories by Polish writer Stanisław Lem, originally published in 1965, with an English translation appearing in 1974. The main protagonists of the series are Trurl and Klapaucius, the \"constructors\".\n\nThe vast majority of characters are either robots or intelligent machines. The stories focus on problems of the individual and society, as well as on the vain search for human happiness through technological means. Two of these stories were included in the book \"The Mind's I.\"\n\nThe word \"Cyberiad\" is used in the series only once as a name of a pretty woman in a poem by Elektrybałt, an electronic poet invented by Trurl. There is a steel statue of Elektrybalt in the Copernicus Science Centre, Warsaw. \n\nThe whole series was published in the 1965 Polish collection \"Cyberiada\" by Wydawnictwo Literackie and also included stories published previously elsewhere.\n\n\nPolish title: \"Siedem wypraw Trurla i Klapaucjusza\"\nAll these stories were first published in the 1965 Polish collection \"Cyberiada\" by Wydawnictwo Literackie.\n\nTrurl and Klapaucius are brilliant (robotic) engineers, called \"constructors\" (because they can construct practically anything at will), capable of almost God-like exploits. For instance, on one occasion Trurl creates an entity capable of extracting accurate information from the random motion of gas particles, which he calls a \"Demon of the Second Kind\". He describes the \"Demon of the First Kind\" as a Maxwell's demon. On another, the two constructors re-arrange stars near their home planet in order to advertise.\n\nThe duo are best friends and rivals. When they are not busy constructing revolutionary mechanisms at home, they travel the universe, aiding those in need. As the characters are firmly established as good and righteous, they take no shame in accepting handsome rewards for their services. If rewards were promised and not delivered, the constructors may even severely punish those who deceived them.\n\nThe universe of \"The Cyberiad\" is pseudo-medieval. There are kingdoms, knights, princesses, and even dragons in abundance. Robots are usually anthropomorphic, to the point of being divided into sexes. Love and marriage are possible. Physical and mental disabilities, old age and death, particularly in case of accidents or murder, are also common, though mechanical language is used to describe them. Death is theoretically avoidable (by means of repair), and sometimes even reversible.\n\nIn fact, the teacher of Trurl and Klapaucius, Master Cerebron, is deceased, but can still be reanimated at his tomb. The level of technology of the vast majority of inhabitants is pseudo-Medieval also, with swords, robotic steeds, and gallows widespread. With this co-exist space travel, extremely advanced technology made by the Constructors and futuristic weapons and devices used or mentioned on occasion. There even exists a civilization that has achieved the \"HPLD\" – Highest Possible Level of Development.\n\nSome stories are basically self-conscious parodies of romantic novels about knights, with more profound issues of psychology and social dynamics under a cartoonish and swashbuckling facade. Three of them were published in an earlier collection, \"Fables for Robots\".\n\nA typical example is the fairy tale \"O królewiczu Ferrycym i królewnie Krystalii\" (\"Prince Ferrix and the Princess Crystal\"). A princely (robotic) knight falls in love with a beautiful (robotic) princess. Unfortunately, the princess is somewhat eccentric, and is captivated by stories of an alien non-robotic, \"paleface\" civilization (the humans). She declares that she will only marry a \"paleface\". Therefore, the knight decides to masquerade as a paleface. He covers himself with mud, starting to resemble one, and then comes to woo her.\n\nMeanwhile, a real \"paleface\" captive arrives, given as a gift to the king. It immediately becomes obvious to the princess who is the \"muddier\" one, but the \"paleface\" turns out to be too squishy and overall disgusting. Not wanting to back down at the last minute, however, the princess declares a joust between the two suitors to select the worthier one. When the \"paleface\" charges at the robot, he splatters himself on the latter's metal chest, revealing the metallic body to all. The princess, beholding the beauty of the exposed robot (compared with the ugliness of the \"paleface\"), changes her mind. The knight and the princess live happily ever after.\n\nMost of the stories involve Trurl and Klapaucius using their extraordinary technological abilities to help the inhabitants of the medieval planets, usually involving neutralizing tyrants.\n\nTrurl and Klapaucius come to a planet ruled by a king who loves hunting. He has already \"conquered\" all the most dangerous of predators, and now hires constructors (engineers) to make new, mighty robotic beasts for him to hunt. He has already executed all of the previous constructors who visited because they could not build beasts that would be challenging enough to hunt. When the two famous Constructors arrive, they are arrested and ordered to construct a worthy foe for the king within twelve days.\n\nThe two face a dilemma: if they make something that the king will kill, they will be executed by the mad king. But if the king himself is killed, then they will be executed, for the next king will be pressured to show his respect for the previous. They solve the problem by building an animal that survives the hunt (involving both cyber-hounds and nuclear tipped missiles unleashed upon it, in the characteristic cartoonish manner) and takes the king hostage by, nothing less, turning into several police officers and presenting an order for his arrest. All the king's men fail to find and free the king (partially because in searching for the fake policemen one half of the real police force arrests the other half), and he is released only after the Constructors' numerous demands are met.\n\nOn another occasion, Trurl and Klapaucius are captured by an interstellar \"PHT\" pirate. Trurl offers to build a machine capable of turning hydrogen into gold (something he can do manually, which he demonstrates by hand, mixing up protons and putting electrons around). However, the pirate turns out to have a PhD and cares not for the riches, but for knowledge (and in fact points out that gold becomes cheap if it is abundant). Trurl therefore makes a modified Maxwell's demon for him, an entity that looks at moving particles of gas and reads information that is, coincidentally, encoded in their random perturbations. This way, all the information in the universe becomes easily available. The demon prints out this information on a long paper tape, but before the pirate realizes most of the information is completely useless (although strictly factual) he is buried under the endless rolls of tape, ceasing to bother anyone.\n\nLem was very interested in the issue of the nature of an ideal society: compare his \"Peace on Earth\", \"The Futurological Congress\" and \"Observation on the Spot\".\n\nThe Highest Possible Level of Development civilization. A gravely injured hermit comes to Trurl's house and tells Trurl of Klapaucius's adventure: Klapaucius wanders across an old robot, who tells him that he has logically deduced the existence of a civilization that reached the highest possible level of development (hence \"HPLD\"). He has inferred the existence of such a civilization by figuring that if there are different stages of development, there will be one that is the highest. He was then faced with a problem of identifying that one; as he noted, everyone claimed that theirs was the HPLD.\n\nUpon much research and thought, he decided that the only way to find it is by looking for a \"wonder\", i.e. something that has no rational explanation. Eventually Klapaucius discovers one such wonder: a star in the shape of a cube, orbited by a planet also shaped like a cube with the huge letters HPLD written on it. He lands and meets its inhabitants: a group of about 100 individuals lying around doing nothing. When the HPLDs grow tired with Klapaucius's efforts to extract answers from them, they teleport him and his ship far into outer space, albeit after filling the ship with gifts.\n\nSeeing how he will not get anywhere this way, Klapaucius constructs a massive machine capable of simulating the entire universe, including a member of the HPLD civilization. Upon questioning the simulation, he is informed that over six million such interrogations took place in the past. The simulation also reveals that the civilization in question has long since achieved the HPLD, and thus has nothing else to strive for.\n\nWhen Klapaucius asks why the HPLD civilization does not continuously engage in helping other, less advanced civilizations, the simulation explains that their attempts to do so in the past have proven extremely counter-productive. For instance, having dropped some millions of wish-fulfilling devices on a planet, they saw it blow up in a matter of hours. Eventually, the HPLD representative provides Klapaucius with the formula for \"Altruizine\" – a substance that allows individuals within a limited area to completely share all feelings and emotions, including both pain and joy. The idea behind Altruizine is that people who feel each other's pain as their own should treat each other as they would themselves.\n\nAltruizine. Klapaucius produces a large quantity of the substance and sends the above-mentioned hermit (who is eager to help others) in human guise to experiment on the population of a single planet. Some of the results include villagers feeling the birth pains of a cow, depressed people being violently attacked and driven off and a crowd storming the house of the newlyweds to vicariously participate in their unaccustomed sensations.\n\nEventually, the hermit is identified for a robot (because he does not feel the humans' pain), is thoroughly beaten and tortured, then shot into outer space via a cannon. He then lands near Trurl's house, where the story began. Concluding his tale, the hermit assures Trurl that his thirst for altruism has vanished.\n\nTrurl and the construction of happy worlds. Trurl is not deterred by the cautionary tale of altruizine and decides to build a race of robots happy by design. His first attempt are a culture of robots who are not capable of being unhappy (e.g. they are happy if seriously beaten up). Klapaucius ridicules this. Next step is a collectivistic culture dedicated to common happiness. When Trurl and Klapaucius visit them, they are drafted by the Ministry of Felicity and made to smile, sing, and otherwise be happy, in fixed ranks (with other inhabitants).\n\nTrurl annihilates both failed cultures and tries to build a perfect society in a small box. The inhabitants of the box develop a religion saying that their box is the most perfect part of the universe and prepare to make a hole in it in order to bring everyone outside the Box into its perfection, by force if needed. Trurl disposes of them and decides that he needs more variety in his experiments and smaller scale for safety.\n\nHe creates hundreds of miniature worlds on microscope slides (i.e. he has to observe them through a microscope). These microworlds progress rapidly, some dying out in revolutions and wars, and some developing as regular civilizations without any of them showing any intrinsic perfection or happiness. They do achieve inter-slide travel though, and many of these worlds are later destroyed by rats.\n\nEventually, Trurl gets tired of all the work and builds a computer that will contain a programmatic clone of his mind that would do the research for him. Instead of building new worlds, the computer sets about expanding itself. When Trurl eventually forces it to stop building itself and start working, the clone-Trurl tells him that he has already created lots of sub-Trurl programs to do the work and tells him stories about their research (which Trurl later finds out is bogus). Trurl destroys the computer and temporarily stops looking for universal happiness.\n\nNote that the last section of the story, does not appear in Michael Kandel's English translation of \"The Cyberiad\", and neither does in Italian translation.\n\nIn 1970, Krzysztof Meyer composed \"Cyberiada\" – an opera to his own libretto based on selected stories.\n\n\"The Seventh Sally or How Trurl's Own Perfection Led to No Good\" (Polish title: \"Wyprawa siódma, czyli o tym jak własna doskonałość Trurla do złego przywiodła\") was adapted as part of the plot for the film \"Victim of the Brain\", there called \"The Perfect Imitation\".\n\n\"The Seventh Sally\" was also an inspiration of the game \"SimCity\".\n\n\n"}

Written by biographer Tom Santopietro, the book demonstrates how \"The Godfather\" was a turning point in American cultural consciousness. With its emphasis on proud ethnicity, \"The Godfather\" changed not just the way Italian-Americans saw themselves, but how Americans of all backgrounds viewed their individual and national self-identities, their possibilities, and attendant disappointments.\n\nThe \"Godfather Effect\" had a broader philosophical dimension, as well. As noted by Santopietro, \"what Puzo delivered - brilliantly - was nothing less than a disquisition on the madness, glory, and failure of the American dream.\" Early in the novel, Amerigo Bonasera declares “I believe in America.” The novel then depicts a nation where Mafia and big business are two sides of the same coin: both are corrupt, tell the truth selectively, and do exactly as they wish.\n\n\"The Godfather Effect\" was widely reviewed, and well received by the press. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called it \"a beautiful narrative of the way pop culture shapes our self-image.\"\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" declared that \"part memoir, part devotional film essay and part reflection on the meaning of ethnicity in American life, \"The Godfather Effect\" defines how the \"Godfather\" movies, along with the 1969 Mario Puzo novel from which they were adapted, reflected the madness, glory and failure of the American dream. By exploring that dream in distinctly Italian-American terms, the movies succeeded in delivering nothing less than the Italianization of American culture. In other words, they were so cool that everyone wanted to seem a little Italian.\"\n\n\"Newsday\" appreciated the personal dimension in Santopietro's book, noting, \"In the end, it's the personal moments, such as Santopietro taking his aging dad to revisit the field where he played baseball as a child, that are most rewarding. The films make up the shell of \"The Godfather Effect\", but it's the connections with family that give it a center as sweet as cannoli cream.\"\n\nThe \"New York Journal of Books\" found that Santopietro “capably weaves together the memoirist elements, the history, and the analyses of the formal and thematic aspects of the films.”\n\nThe book was recognized for its historical value by \"Smithsonian Magazine\", the official publication of the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nAn acclaimed biographer,\nTom Santopietro wrote in-depth studies of several Hollywood icons, each of whom reflected and defined the American cultural landscape. These included Doris Day (\"Considering Doris Day\"), Barbra Streisand (\"The Importance of Being Barbra\"), and the definitive account of Frank Sinatra's Hollywood film career (\"Sinatra in Hollywood\").\n\n"}

Eventually, she becomes a celebrity of sorts, appearing on \"The Mike Douglas Show\", and captures the hearts of the American people. Soon, she is less than a foot tall, making her like a doll and forcing her to move into a dollhouse.\n\nPat is kidnapped by a group of mad scientists, who make it seem that she perished in the kitchen garbage disposal.

Vanishing from sight, she is again presumed dead, but in fact she falls into a puddle of spilled household chemicals - which return her to her original size.

Overjoyed at the news, Stephen shows Andy the nanobots and explains what a remarkable breakthrough they are.\n\nLater that day Andy discovers that he has pelvic cancer, and has approximately one year to live if the hip and leg are not removed. In desperation he sneaks into Stephen's lab and injects himself with the nanobots. They quickly eliminate his cancer.\n\nWhen Andy tells Stephen about the success of his nanobots, Stephen becomes concerned about the impact they may have on Andy's health—and about the possibility that he may go to prison for using an untested drug on another person. Andy tells Stephen not to worry because he injected himself without Stephen's knowledge. Stephen still wants to deactivate the nanobots, but Andy refuses.\n\nThe nanobots not only cure Andy's cancer, they improve his health in other ways, including: removing a scar, improving his eyesight, and making him more energetic and sexually active with his fiancée. In Stephen's lab, Andy puts his hand over a bunsen burner causing a severe burn, but the nanobots repair the damaged skin in seconds.\n\nStephen embarks on a series of tests to find out exactly what the nanobots are capable of. Andy is submerged in water and unable to breathe, but the nanobots keep him alive. Things begin to go wrong when he wakes up the following day to find that the nanobots have responded to the tests by giving him gills, allowing him to breathe underwater in the future. After telling Stephen of this, they both agree that the nanobots must be deactivated immediately. Stephen is unsuccessful—he takes measure after measure to stop them, but he is never able to eradicate all of them.\n\nThe nanobots continue making \"improvements\" to Andy, including giving him eyes in the back of his head, bones above his stomach, \nextra keen hearing, and jellyfish-like stinging tentacles on his skin.\n\nStephen is ultimately unable to deactivate or remove the nanobots, and Andy wants to die to keep his fiancée from seeing the monster he has become. Stephen kills Andy with electrocution and burns his laboratory, destroying any remaining nanobots and his research. The episode ends with Andy's grieving fiancée having cut her finger on a shattered photograph of him. The wound heals immediately, implying that the nanobots have spread to her as well.\n\nThe outdoor scenes were filmed at Capilano University, in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. \n\n"}

{"id": "286347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286347", "title": "Turkology", "text": "Turkology\n\nTurkology (or Turcology) is a complex of humanities sciences studying languages, history, literature, folklore, culture, and ethnology of people speaking Turkic languages and Turkic peoples in chronological and comparative context. This includes ethnic groups from the Sakha in East Siberia to the Balkan Turks and Gagauz in Moldova.\n\nEthnological information on Turkic tribes for the first time was systemized by the 11th-century Turkic philologist Mahmud al-Kashgari in the \"Dīwān ul-Lughat it-Turk\" (Dictionary of Turkic language). Multi-lingual dictionaries were compiled from the late 13th century for the practical application of participants in international trade and political life: Kipchak (Cuman)-Persian-Latin-German \"Codex Cumanicus\", \"Armenian-Kipchak\", and \"Russian-Kipchak\" dictionaries. By the Middle Ages the Turkology was centred around Byzantine/Greek historians, ambassadors and travelers, and geographers. In the 15th-17th centuries the main subject of Turkology was the study of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish language, and the Turkic languages of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. In 1533 a first hand-written primer appeared, and by 1612 a printed grammar by Jerome Megizer was published, followed by F. Mesgnien-Meninski's 4-volume \"Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalium\" published in 1680.\n\nP. S. Pallas initiated a more scientific approach to Turkology with his \"Comparative dictionaries of all languages and dialects\" (1787) which included lexical materials from Tatar, Mishar, Nogai, Bashkir, and other Türkic languages. In the 19th century, Turkology was further developed by M. A. Kazembek's \"Grammar of the Turkish-Tatar language\" (1839), O. N. Betlingk \"Grammar of the Yakut language\" (1851). A major achievement was the deciphering at the end of the 19th century of the Early Middle Age Orkhon inscriptions by V. Thomsen and W. W. Radloff (1895). By the end of the 19th century, Turkology developed into a complex discipline that included linguistics, history, ethnology, archeology, arts and literature. In the 20th century the Turkology complex included physical anthropology, numismatics, genetics, ancient Turkic alphabetic scripts, typology, genesis, and etymology, onomastics and toponymy. The appearance of \"Türkische Bibliothek\" (1905–27) inaugurated specialised periodicals, followed by \"Mitteilungen zur Osmanischen Geschichte\" (1921–26). Scientific developments allowed calibrated dating, dendrochronology, metallurgy, chemistry, textile, and other specialized disciplines which contributed to the development of the Turkological studies. Deeper study of the ancient sources allowed better understanding of economical, social, mythological and cultural forces of the sedentary and nomadic societies. Linguistic studies uncovered pre-literate symbioses and mutual influences between different peoples.\n\nOn 9 August 1944 the Central Committee VKP(b), the ruling party of the USSR, published an edict prohibiting \"ancientization\" of Turkic history. The edict was followed by a consecutive wave of mass arrests, imprisoning and killing of the intelligentsia, massive creation of replacement \"scientists\", and re-writing of history pages on an industrial scale. Combined with the concurrent wholesale deportation of indigenous populations to remote areas in Middle Asia and Siberia, the wipe-out of the science was nearly complete, and the impact of the action subsided only partially in the newly independent countries after the collapse of the USSR. In the two decades after the Bolshevik's assuming power, the tradition of Turkological studies in Russia and dependent countries was practically wiped out.\n\nOn the other hand, this edict brought unintended benefits to Turkology. One was the nearly immediate linguistic development of an alternate lexicon which replaced the nouns and adjectives containing the word \"Türk\" by a wealth of euphemisms: \"nomads, Siberians, Paleosiberians, Middle Asians, Scythians, Altaians, Tuvians\", etc. that filled scientific publications. The other was \"writing into a drawer\", when results of the years of fruitful work were written down for future publication. When the bonds relaxed, the publications exploded. Another was a flight of scientists from European Russia into remote areas, which brought first class scientists to many intellectually starved outlying areas of Middle Asia. Another one was connected with the statewide efforts to re-invent the history, when a wealth of Turkological facts were found in the process of search for \"correct\" history. And another one was a built-up of the public interest for the forbidden subjects, that resulted that no print size could satisfy the demand. L.N.Gumilev and O.Suleimenov inflamed a surge in the new generation of Turkology scholars.\n\nWith the physical culling of the scholars from the society, concurrently was also organized a total extermination of all their published and unpublished works, their books were removed from the libraries and destroyed from private collections by intimidated population, articles and publications were culled, published photographs were retouched, private photographs were destroyed, published scientific references were erased, or publications with undesired references were destroyed. Very few of the early 20th century expedition diaries, ethnographical notes, reports and drafts for publications were ever recovered.\n\n\n\nA selection of English-language periodicals studying Turkology\n\n\n"}
