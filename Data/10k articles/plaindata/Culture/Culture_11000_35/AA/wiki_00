{"id": "393363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=393363", "title": "Augustan History", "text": "Augustan History\n\nThe Augustan History (Latin: \"Historia Augusta\") is a late Roman collection of biographies, written in Latin, of the Roman Emperors, their junior colleagues, designated heirs and usurpers of the period 117 to 284. Supposedly modeled on the similar work of Suetonius, \"The Twelve Caesars\", it presents itself as a compilation of works by six different authors (collectively known as the \"Scriptores Historiae Augustae\"), written during the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine I and addressed to those emperors or other important personages in Rome. The collection, as extant, comprises thirty biographies, most of which contain the life of a single emperor, while some include a group of two or more, grouped together merely because these emperors were either similar or contemporaneous.\n\nHowever, the true authorship of the work, its actual date, and its purpose, have long been matters for controversy amongst historians and scholars, ever since Hermann Dessau in 1889 rejected both the date and the authorship as stated within the manuscript. Major problems include the nature of the sources it used, and how much of the content is pure fiction. For instance, the collection contains in all about 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations. Virtually all of these are now considered to be fraudulent.\n\nBy the second decade of the 21st century, the overall consensus supported the position that there was only a single author who was writing either at the end of the 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. There is further consensus that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.\n\nThe name \"Historia Augusta\" originated with Isaac Casaubon, who produced a critical edition in 1603, working from a complex manuscript tradition with a number of variant versions. The title as recorded on the \"Codex Palatinus\" manuscript (written in the 9th century) is \"Vitae Diversorum Principum et Tyrannorum a Divo Hadriano usque ad Numerianum Diversis compositae\" (\"The Lives of various Emperors and Tyrants from the Divine Hadrian to Numerian by Various Authors\"), and it is assumed that the work may have been originally called \"de Vita Caesarum\" or \"Vitae Caesarum\".\n\nHow widely the work was circulated in late antiquity is unknown, but its earliest use was in a \"Roman History\" composed by Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus in 485. Lengthy citations from it are found in authors of the 6th and 9th centuries, including Sedulius Scottus who quoted parts of the \"Marcus Aurelius\", the \"Maximini\" and the \"Aurelian\" within his \"Liber de Rectoribus Christianis\", and the chief manuscripts also date from the 9th or 10th centuries. The six \"Scriptores\" – \"Aelius Spartianus\", \"Julius Capitolinus\", \"Vulcacius Gallicanus\", \"Aelius Lampridius\", \"Trebellius Pollio\", and \"Flavius Vopiscus (of Syracuse)\" – dedicate their biographies to Diocletian, Constantine and various private persons, and so ostensibly were all writing around the late 3rd and early 4th century. The first four \"scriptores\" are attached to the lives from Hadrian to Gordian III, while the final two are attached to the lives from Valerian to Numerian.\n\nThe biographies cover the emperors from Hadrian to Carinus and Numerian. A section covering the reigns of Philip the Arab, Decius, Trebonianus Gallus, Aemilian and all but the end of the reign of Valerian is missing in all the manuscripts, and it has been argued that biographies of Nerva and Trajan have also been lost at the beginning of the work, which may suggest the compilation might have been a direct continuation of Suetonius' \"The Twelve Caesars\". It has been theorized that the mid-3rd-century lacuna might actually be a deliberate literary device of the author or authors, saving the labour of covering Emperors for whom little source material may have been available.\n\nDespite devoting whole books to ephemeral or in some cases non-existent usurpers, there are no independent biographies of the Emperors Quintillus and Florian, whose reigns are merely briefly noted towards the end of the biographies of their respective predecessors, Claudius Gothicus and Tacitus. For nearly 300 years after Casaubon's edition, though much of the \"Augustan History\" was treated with some scepticism, it was used by historians as an authentic source – Edward Gibbon used it extensively in the first volume of the \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\". However, \"in modern times most scholars read the work as a piece of deliberate mystification written much later than its purported date, however the fundamentalist view still has distinguished support. (...) The \"Historia Augusta\" is also, unfortunately, the principal Latin source for a century of Roman history. The historian must make use of it, but only with extreme circumspection and caution.\"\n\nExisting manuscripts and witnesses of the \"Augustan History\" fall into three groups:\n\n\nIn Marshall's opinion, the best scholarly editions are those by H. Peter (Teubner, 2nd ed. 1884), & E. Hohl (Teubner, 1971, reissue of 1965 revised by Ch. Samberger & W. Seyfarth).\n\nA later version of the Codex Palatinus (possibly a version that was made for Petrarch in 1356) was the basis of the \"editio princeps\" of the \"History\", published in Milan in 1475. A subsequent printed version (the Aldine edition) was published at Venice in 1516, and this was followed closely by an edition edited by Desiderius Erasmus, and published by Johann Froben in Basel in 1518.\n\nIn 1776, Gibbon had observed that there was something wrong with the numbers and names of the imperial biographers, and that this had already been recognised by older historians who had written on that subject. A clear example was the referencing of the biographer 'Lampridius' (who was apparently writing his biographies after 324) by 'Vopiscus', who was meant to be writing his biographies in 305-6. Then in 1889, Hermann Dessau, who had become increasingly concerned by the large number of anachronistic terms, Vulgar Latin vocabulary, and especially the host of obviously false proper names in the work, proposed that the six authors were all fictitious personae, and that the work was in fact composed by a single author in the late 4th century, probably in the reign of Theodosius I. Among his supporting evidence was that the life of Septimius Severus appeared to have made use of a passage from the mid-4th-century historian Aurelius Victor, and that the life of Marcus Aurelius likewise uses material from Eutropius. In the decades following Dessau, many scholars argued to preserve at least some of the six \"Scriptores\" as distinct persons and in favour of the first-hand authenticity for the content. As early as 1890, Theodor Mommsen postulated a Theodosian 'editor' of the \"Scriptores\"' work, an idea that has resurfaced many times since. Hermann Peter (editor of the \"Augustan History\" and of the \"Historicorum Romanorum reliquiae\") proposed a date of 330 for when the work was written, based upon an analysis of style and language. Others, such as Norman H. Baynes, abandoned the early 4th century date but only advanced it as far as the reign of Julian the Apostate (useful for arguing the work was intended as pagan propaganda).\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s however Dessau's original arguments received powerful restatement and expansion from Sir Ronald Syme, who devoted three books to the subject and was prepared to date the writing of the work closely in the region of AD 395. Other recent studies also show much consistency of style, and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395. Although it was believed that the \"History Augusta\" did not reference any material from Ammianus Marcellinus' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period, this has now been shown not to be the case, and that the \"Historia Augusta\" does in fact make reference to Ammianus' history.\n\nNot all scholars have accepted the theory of a forger working around the last decades of the 4th century or the beginning of the 5th. Arnaldo Momigliano and A. H. M. Jones were the most prominent 20th century critics of the Dessau-Syme theory amongst English-speaking scholars. Momigliano, summarizing the literature from Dessau down to 1954, defined the question as \"res iudicanda\" (i.e. \"a matter to be decided\") and not as \"res iudicata\" (\"a matter that has been decided\"). Momigliano reviewed every book published on the topic by Sir Ronald Syme, and provided counter arguments to most if not all of Syme's arguments. For instance, the reference in the \"Life of Probus\" about the emperor's descendants which has been taken to refer to Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) and his family may, in the opinion of Momigliano, equally refer to the earlier members of the family, which was prominent throughout the 4th century, such as Petronius Probinus (consul in 341) and Petronius Probianus (consul in 322). Momigliano's opinion was that there was insufficient evidence to dismiss a composition date of the early 4th century, and that any post-Constantinian anachronisms could be explained by an editor working on the material at a later date, perhaps during the reigns of Constantius II or Julian.\n\nOther opinions included Dr H Stern's, who postulated that the \"History\" was composed by a team of writers during the reign of Constantius II after the defeat of Magnentius on behalf of the Senatorial aristocracy who had supported the usurper. In the 21st century, Alan Cameron rebutted a number of Syme's and Barnes' arguments for a composition date c.395–400, suggesting a composition date between 361 and the 380s.\n\nLinked to the problem of dating the composition of the \"History\" is the question about the authorship of the work. Taking the \"History\" at face value, there is clearly a division between the authors named prior and after the presence of the interrupting lacuna. For the first half of the \"History\", four \"scriptores\" are present, and the biographies are divided in a remarkably erratic fashion:\n\nOf these four, Spartianus and Gallicanus claim to be undertaking a complete set of imperial biographies from Julius Caesar onwards, while Lampridius' stated intention was to write a collection of biographies that would deal with the Gordians, Claudius II, Aurelian, Diocletian, Maximian and the four rivals of Constantine. Capitolinus also implied that he was writing more biographies than are present in the \"History\".\n\nThe second half of the \"History\" is divided between two \"scriptores\". Unlike the first half, the emperors tackled in this section are grouped logically, and are divided roughly in half between the two \"scriptores\" in chronological sequence:\n\nIn terms of any acknowledgement of the mutual existence between the \"scriptores\", only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306) refers to any of the other authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius). None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of any of their 'colleagues'. However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the \"Albinus\", \"Maximini\" and \"Gordiani\" he addresses Constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306.\n\nThe theory that there was a single author, as initially postulated by Hermann Dessau, is based on the difficulties inherent in having a single work comprising a number of individuals but without any textual evidence of an editor who brought the material together. This is especially evident in that the text has examples of stated intentions by an author to write a life of one of the emperors, only for that life to be completed by another of the \"scriptores\". If those statements are true, and those additional lives were completed, then an editor must have been involved in the project in order to select one \"scriptor\"'s life over another's.\n\nHowever, the presence of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by Theodore Mommsen, still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of the second half of the \"History\", operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was also responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series. He takes the view that the vast stylistic differences between the two halves of the \"History\" means they cannot have been written by the same author.\n\nNevertheless, if the validity of six independent authors is accepted, there are still issues, as the way they approached their work does show similar themes and details. All six not only provide biographies for the emperors, but also for the \"Caesars\" and usurpers. They describe their work and approach in very similar language, and quote otherwise unknown historians and biographers, such as Junius Cordus. They collectively share many errors, such as calling Diadumenianus \"Diadumenus\". They also share much idiosyncratic content and similar language, with particular focus on women, wine and military discipline, and were fixated on poor plays on words ascribing personality traits to certain emperors, for instance Verus was truthful, while Severus was a severe individual. Additionally, the authors shared certain stylistic characteristics that has been suggested would not naturally occur between individuals writing separately. For instance, the authors all happen to use the word \"occido\" with respect to killing (a total of 42 occurrences), but only once do any of them use the alternative word of \"interficio\". This ratio is not found with any other writers in this time period and for this genre. Finally, each of the six \"scriptores\" authored fictional lives for some of their biographies, all of them using fake sources, documents and acclamations.\n\nIt has been postulated that the names of the \"scriptores\" themselves are also a form of literary playfulness, not only mocking both legitimate authors and historians, but also the narrative itself. The names Trebellius Pollio and Flavius Vopiscus are sourced in various ways from Cicero's writings, as is the name Capitolinus. Further, the word \"vopiscus\" is a rare Latin term, referring to a twin who survives, while its sibling died \"in utero\"; this has been interpreted to refer to \"Flavius Vopiscus\" as being the final one to survive from the six authors of the \"History\". Vulcacius is believed to be a mockery of Volcatius Sedigitus, who was a historical literary critic with some association with humor. The meanings behind the other two \"scriptores\" (Spartianus and Lampridius) have eluded interpretation.\n\nFinally, it should also be noted that the results of recent computer-assisted stylistic analysis concerning the single vs multiple authorship have proven to be inconclusive:\n\"Computer-aided stylistic analysis of the work has, however, returned ambiguous results; some elements of style are quite uniform throughout the work, while others vary in a way that suggests multiple authorship. To what extent this is due to the fact that portions of the work are obviously compiled from multiple sources is unclear. Several computer analyses of the text have been done to determine whether there were multiple authors. Many of them conclude that there was but a single author, but disagree on methodology. However, several studies done by the same team concluded there were several authors, though they were not sure how many.\"\n\nA unique feature of the \"Augustan History\" is that it purports to supply the biographies not only of reigning Emperors (called \"primary lives\" by modern scholars), but also \"secondary lives\" of their designated heirs, junior colleagues, and usurpers who unsuccessfully claimed the supreme power. Thus among the biographies of 2nd-century and early 3rd-century figures are included Hadrian's heir Aelius Caesar, and the usurpers Avidius Cassius, Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus, Caracalla's brother Geta and Macrinus' son Diadumenianus. None of these pieces contain much in the way of solid information: all are marked by rhetorical padding and obvious fiction. The biography of Marcus Aurelius' colleague Lucius Verus, which Mommsen thought 'secondary', is however rich in apparently reliable information and has been vindicated by Syme as belonging to the 'primary' series.\n\nThe 'secondary' lives allowed the author to exercise freedom in the invention of events, places and people without the need to conform to authentic historical facts. As the work proceeds the author's inventiveness undergoes an increasing degree of elaboration as legitimate historical sources begin to run out, eventually composing largely fictional accounts such as the \"biographies\" of the \"Thirty Tyrants\", whom the author claimed had risen as usurpers under Gallienus. Moreover, after the biography of Caracalla the 'primary' biographies, of the emperors themselves, begin to assume the rhetorical and fictive qualities previously confined to the 'secondary' ones, probably because the secondary lives were written after the \"Life of Caracalla\".\n\nThe biography of Macrinus is notoriously unreliable, and after a partial reversion to reliability in the \"Life of Elagabalus\", the \"Alexander Severus\", one of the longest biographies in the entire work, develops into a kind of exemplary and rhetorical fable on the theme of the wise philosopher king. Clearly the author's previous sources had given out, but also his inventive talents were developing. He still makes use of some recognized sources – Herodian up to 238, and probably Dexippus in the later books, for the entire imperial period the \"Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte\" as well as Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, Ammianus Marcellinus and Jerome – but the biographies are increasingly tracts of invention in which occasional nuggets of fact are embedded.\n\nHowever, even where recognisable facts are present, their use in the \"History\" cannot be taken at face value. In the \"Life of Alexander Severus\", the \"History\" makes the claim at 24.4 that Alexander had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal, although the author added that the emperor Philip did later ban the practice. Although the claim about Alexander is false, the note about Philip is true – the source of this is Aurelius Victor (28.6–7, and who in turn sourced it from the \"Kaisergeschichte\"), and the \"History\" even copies Victor's style of moralising asides, which were not in the \"Kaisergeschichte\". Normally, this anecdote would have been included in a Life of Philip, but its absence saw the author include it in another life. This is taken as evidence that the mid-work lacuna is deliberate, as the author was apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from the \"Kaisergeschichte\".\n\nInterpretations of the purpose of the \"History\" also vary considerably, some considering it a work of fiction or satire intended to entertain (perhaps in the vein of \"1066 and All That\"), others viewing it as a pagan attack on Christianity, the writer having concealed his identity for personal safety. Under this anti-Christianity theory, the lacuna covering the period from Philip the Arab through to the end of Valerian's reign is seen as deliberate, as it freed the author from addressing Philip's reign, as by the late 4th century, Philip was being claimed as a Christian emperor, as well as not discussing Decius and Valerian's reigns, as they were well known persecutors of the Church. It also avoided dealing with their fates, as Christians saw their ends as divine retribution for their persecutions. In fact, where mentioned, both Decius and Valerian are viewed very positively by the author of the \"History\". Further, it is noted that the \"History\" also parodies Christian scripture. For instance, in the \"Life of Alexander Severus\" there is: \"It is said that on the day after his birth a star of the first magnitude was visible for the entire day at Arca Caesarea\", while \"where, save at Rome, is there an imperial power that rules an empire?\" is considered to be a response to 2 Thessalonians 2:6–7.\n\nSyme argued that it was a mistake to regard it as a historical work at all and that no clear propaganda purpose could be determined. He theorized that the \"History\" is primarily a literary product – an exercise in satire produced by a 'rogue scholiast' catering to (and making fun of or parodying) the antiquarian tendencies of the Theodosian age, in which Suetonius and Marius Maximus were fashionable reading and Ammianus Marcellinus was producing sober history in the manner of Tacitus. (The \"History\" implausibly makes the Emperor Tacitus (275–276) a descendant and connoisseur of the historian). In fact in a passage on the \"Quadriga tyrannorum\" — the 'four-horse chariot of usurpers' said to have aspired to the purple in the reign of Probus — the \"History\" itself accuses Marius Maximus of being a producer of 'mythical history': \"homo omnium verbosissimus, qui et mythistoricis se voluminibis implicavit\" ('the most long-winded of men, who furthermore wrapped himself up in volumes of historical fiction'). The term \"mythistoricis\" occurs nowhere else in Latin. Of considerable significance in this regard is the opening section of the life of Aurelian, in which 'Flavius Vopiscus' records a supposed conversation he had with the City Prefect of Rome during the festival of Hilaria in which the Prefect urges him to write as he chooses and invent what he does not know.\nOther examples of the work as a parody can be taken from the names of the \"Scriptores\" themselves. It has been suggested that \"Trebellius Pollio\" and \"Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius\" were invented, with one theory arguing that their origins are based on passages in Cicero's letters and speeches in the 1st century BC. With respect to \"Trebellius Pollio\", this is a reference to Lucius Trebellius, a supporter of Mark Antony who was mentioned in the Philippics (\"Phil\", 11.14), and another reference to him in \"Epistulae ad Familiares\" along with the term \"Pollentiam\" reminded the \"History's\" author of Asinius Pollio, who was a fellow Plebeian Tribune alongside Lucius Trebellius and a historian as well. This is reinforced by noted similarities between the fictitious criticism of \"Trebellius Pollio\" by \"Flavius Vopiscus\" at the start of the \"Life of Aurelian\", with similar comments made by Asinius Pollio about Julius Caesar's published \"Commentaries\". Significantly, Lucius Trebellius adopted the Cognomen \"Fides\" for his actions as Plebeian Tribune in 47 BC to resist laws that would abolish debts; later when he fell into debt himself and began supporting debt abolishment, Cicero used his cognomen as a method of abuse and ridicule. According to this theory it is no coincidence that, in selecting the name \"Trebellius Pollio\", the author is playing with the concepts of \"fides\" and \"fidelitas historica\" at the precise point in the lives that are assigned to \"Trebellius Pollio\" and \"Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius\".\n\nIn the case of \"Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius\", it was argued that it too was inspired by the Philippics' reference to \"Caesar Vopiscus\" (\"Phil\", 11.11), with Cicero's reference to Vopiscus immediately preceding his reference to Lucius Trebellius. The cognomen \"Syracusius\" was selected because Cicero's \"In Verrem\" is filled with references to \"Syracusae\" and \"Syracusani\". Further, in Cicero's \"De Oratore\", Cicero refers to Strabo Vopiscus as an authority on humour, during which he refers to the reputation of Sicilians when it came to humour, and Syracuse was one of the principal cities of Sicily. Such references were intended as a \"knowing wink\" to the readers of the \"History\", who would recognise the mockery of the historical material by the author. This corresponds with David Rohrbacher's view of the \"History\", who maintains that the author has no political or theological agenda; rather that the \"History\" is the equivalent of a literary puzzle or game, with the reader's understanding and enjoyment of the numerous elaborate and complicated allusions contained within it being the only purpose behind its existence.\n\nIn support of this theory, Rohrbacher provides an example with respect to Ammianus Marcellinus' work. In one passage (Amm. 19.12.14), Ammianus describes the Christian emperor Constantius II's attempts to prosecute cases of magic under treason laws, in particular the death penalty applied to those men who were condemned simply for wearing an amulet to ward off diseases: \"si qui remedia quartanae vel doloris alterius collo gestaret\" (\"For if anyone wore on his neck an amulet against the quartan ague or any other complaint\"). There is a very similar imperial ruling described in the \"Life of Caracalla\" (5.7), which makes no sense in Caracalla's time, and is worded in almost exactly the same way: \"qui remedia quartanis tertianisque collo adnexas gestarent\" (\"wearing them around their necks as preventives of quartan or tertian fever\").\n\nOther theories include André Chastagnol's minimalist opinion that the author was a pagan who supported the Senate and the Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races, while François Paschoud proposed that the last books of the \"History\" are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, with events and the personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven into the fabric of a series of 3rd century emperors. According to Paschoud, the representation of the emperor Probus is in fact a version of Julian, with Carus substituting for Valentinian I and Carinus for Gratian.\n\nFrom the sixth century to the end of the 19th century, historians had recognized that the \"Historia Augusta\" was a flawed and not a particularly reliable source, and since the 20th century modern scholars have tended to treat it with extreme caution. Older historians, such as Edward Gibbon, not fully aware of its problems with respect to the fictitious elements contained within it, generally treated the information preserved within it as authentic. For instance, in Gibbon's account of the reign of Gallienus, he uncritically reproduces the \"Historia Augusta's\" biased and largely fictional account of that reign. So when Gibbon states \"The repeated intelligence of invasions, defeats, and rebellions, he received with a careless smile; and singling out, with affected contempt, some particular production of the lost province, he carelessly asked, whether Rome must be ruined, unless it was supplied with linen from Egypt, and arras cloth from Gaul\", he is reworking the passage in \"The Two Gallieni\":\n\nI am ashamed to relate what Gallienus used often to say at this time, when such things were happening, as though jesting amid the ills of mankind. For when he was told of the revolt of Egypt, he is said to have exclaimed \"What! We cannot do without Egyptian linen!\" and when informed that Asia had been devastated both by the violence of nature and by the inroads of the Scythians, he said, \"What! We cannot do without saltpetre!\" and when Gaul was lost, he is reported to have laughed and remarked, \"Can the commonwealth be safe without Atrebatic cloaks?\" Thus, in short, with regard to all parts of the world, as he lost them, he would jest, as though seeming to have suffered the loss of some article of trifling service.\n\nGibbon then noted after this passage: \"This singular character has, I believe, been fairly transmitted to us. The reign of his immediate successor was short and busy; and the historians who wrote before the elevation of the family of Constantine could not have the most remote interest to misrepresent the character of Gallienus.\" Modern scholars now believe that Gallienus' reputation was posthumously maligned, that he was one of the main architects of the later Roman imperial structure, and that his reforms were built upon by succeeding emperors.\n\nNevertheless, it is unwise to dismiss it altogether as it is also the principal Latin source regarding a century of Roman history. For example, scholars had assumed that Veturius Macrinus mentioned in the Life of Didius Julianus was an invention of the author, like so many other names. However, an inscription was uncovered which confirmed his existence and his post as Praetorian Prefect in 193. Likewise, the information that Hadrian's Wall was constructed during Hadrian's reign and that the Antonine Wall was built during the reign of Antoninus Pius are recorded by no other extant ancient writer apart from the \"Historia Augusta\", the veracity of which has been confirmed by inscriptions.\n\nA peculiarity of the work is its inclusion of a large number of purportedly authentic documents such as extracts from Senate proceedings and letters written by imperial personages. In all it contains around 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations. Records like these are quite distinct from the rhetorical speeches often inserted by ancient historians – it was accepted practice for the writer to invent these himself – and on the few occasions when historians (such as Sallust in his work on Catiline or Suetonius in his \"Twelve Caesars\") include such documents, they have generally been regarded as genuine; but almost all those found in the Historia Augusta have been rejected as fabrications, partly on stylistic grounds, partly because they refer to military titles or points of administrative organisation which are otherwise unrecorded until long after the purported date, or for other suspicious content.\n\nThe \"History\" moreover cites dozens of otherwise unrecorded historians, biographers, letter-writers, knowledgeable friends of the writers, and so on, most of whom must be regarded as expressions of the author's creative imagination. For example, the biographer \"Cordus\" is cited twenty-seven times in the \"History\". Long considered to be a real, but lost, biographer until midway into the 20th century, with a couple of minor exceptions where material claimed to be sourced from Cordus is in reality from Suetonius or Cicero, every other citation is fake, providing details which have been invented and ascribed to Cordus. Cordus is mentioned almost exclusively in those Vitae where the \"History\" used Herodian as the primary source, and his appearances vanish once Herodian's history comes to an end.\n\nThe author would also misattribute material taken from a legitimate historian and ascribe it to a fictitious author. For instance, Herodian is used more often than he is explicitly referenced in the \"History\"; in addition to the ten times he is correctly cited, three times his material is cited as \"Arrianus\", probably to multiply the author's sources. Further, not only does the author copy from Herodian without citation (either direct lifts, abbreviations or supplementations), he often distorts Herodian, to suit his literary objective.\n\nThen there is the deliberate citation of false information which is then ascribed legitimate authors. For instance, at a minimum, five of the \"History's\" sixteen citations of Dexippus are considered to be fake, and Dexippus appears to be mentioned, not as a principal source of information, but rather as a contradictory author to be contrasted against information sourced from Herodian or the \"Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte\". In addition Quintus Gargilius Martialis, who produced works on horticulture and medicine, is cited twice as a biographer, which is considered to be another false attribution.\n\nThe untrustworthiness of the \"History\" stems from the multifarious kinds of fraudulent (as opposed to simply inaccurate) information that run through the work, becoming ever more dominant as it proceeds. The various biographies are ascribed to different invented 'authors', and continue with the dedicatory epistles to Diocletian and Constantine, the quotation of fabricated documents, the citation of non-existent authorities, the invention of persons (extending even to the subjects of some of the minor biographies), presentation of contradictory information to confuse an issue while making a show of objectivity, deliberately false statements, and the inclusion of material which can be shown to relate to events or personages of the late 4th century rather than the period supposedly being written about. For example:\n\n\nCertain scholars have always defended the value of specific parts of the work. Anthony Birley, for instance, has argued that the lives up to Septimius Severus are based on the now-lost biographies of Marius Maximus, which were written as a sequel to Suetonius' \"Lives of the Twelve Caesars\". As a result, his translation of the \"History\" for Penguin Books covers only the first half, and was published as \"Lives of the Later Caesars\", Birley himself supplying biographies of Nerva and Trajan (these are not part of the original texts, which begin with Hadrian).\n\nHis view (part of a tradition that goes back to J. J. Müller, who advanced Marius' claims as early as 1870, and supported by modern scholars such as André Chastagnol) was vigorously contested by Ronald Syme, who theorized that virtually all the identifiable citations from Marius Maximus are essentially frivolous interpolations into the main narrative source, which he postulated was a different Latin author whom he styled 'Ignotus (\"the unknown one\"), the good biographer'. His theory argued, firstly, that as Marius wrote a sequel to the \"Lives of the Twelve Caesars\", his work covered the reigns from Nerva to Elagabalus; consequently, this would not have included a biography of Lucius Verus, even though the biography of that \"Princeps\" in the History is mainly of good quality. Secondly, that 'Ignotus' only went up to Caracalla, as is revealed by the inferior and mostly fictitious biography of Macrinus. Finally, that the composer of the \"Historia Augusta\" wrote the lives of the emperors through to the \"Life of Caracalla\" (including Lucius Verus) using Ignotus as his main source, and supplementing with Marius Maximus on occasion. It was only when the source failed that he turned to other less reliable sources (such as Herodian and Maximus), as well as his own fertile imagination, and it was at this juncture that he composed the first five minor lives, through to the \"Life of Geta\".\n\nA similar theory to Syme's has been put forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was probably a satirical poet, in the same vein as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the \"History\", the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the \"History's\" description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.\n\nThe \"Historia Augusta\" has been described by Ronald Syme as \"the most enigmatic work that Antiquity has transmitted\". Although much of the focus of study throughout the centuries has been on the historical content, since the 20th century there has also been an assessment of the literary value of the work. For much of that time the assessment has been critical, as demonstrated by the analysis put forward by David Magie:\n\nThe literary, as well as the historical, value of the Historia Augusta has suffered greatly as a result of the method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.\n\nM. L. W. Laistner was of the opinion that \"even if the \"Historia Augusta\" was propaganda disguised as biography, it is still a wretched piece of literature\", while Ronald Syme noted that with respect to the author's Latin prose:\n\nHe was not an elegant exponent. His normal language is flat and monotonous. But uneven, and significantly so. For this author is erudite, a fancier of words, and a collector. Hence many rarities, or even inventions ... first, when depicting the measures of a military disciplinarian, he brings in technical terms redolent of the camp. Second, archaism, preciosity, and flowery words.\n\nFurther, the work shows evidence of its having been put together in a very haphazard and hasty fashion, with little to no subsequent editing of the material to form a cohesive narrative. Birley sees an example of the carelessness with which the author approached the work in the construction of Marcus Aurelius' biography, where midway through the \"Life of Marcus Aurelius\" the author found himself in a muddle, probably because he had historical material in excess of what he required, and also because he had already used up much of his source to write separate biographies of Lucius Verus and Avidius Cassius, whose lives intersected with Marcus'. The answer he came up with was to use Eutropius as his source for a brief overview of Marcus' principate following the death of Lucius Verus. However, he found that in doing so, the narrative's ending was too abrupt and so, after including some gossip about Commodus not being his son, he once again began an account of Marcus' reign after the death of Verus.\n\nAlthough these criticisms still form the prevailing view on the \"History's\" literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion as a vehicle for parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, making it one of the most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.\n\n\n</div>\n\n"}
{"id": "27957492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27957492", "title": "Aventine Triad", "text": "Aventine Triad\n\nThe Aventine Triad (also referred to as the plebeian Triad or the agricultural Triad) is a modern term for the joint cult of the Roman deities Ceres, Liber and Libera. The cult was established ca. 493 BC within a sacred district \"(templum)\" on or near the Aventine Hill, traditionally associated with the Roman \"plebs\". Later accounts describe the temple building and rites as \"Greek\" in style. Some modern historians describe the Aventine Triad as a plebeian parallel and self-conscious antithesis to the archaic Capitoline Triad of Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus and the later Capitoline Triad of Jupiter, Minerva and Juno. The Aventine Triad, temple and associated \"ludi\" (games and theatrical performances) served as a focus of plebeian identity, sometimes in opposition to Rome's original ruling elite, the patricians.\n\nThe Aventine relationship between Ceres, Liber and Libera was probably based first on their functions as agricultural and fertility deities of the \"plebs\" as a distinct social group. Liber had been companion to both Ceres and to Libera in separate and disparate fertility cults that were widespread throughout the Hellenised Italian peninsula, long before their official adoption by Rome – or rather, their partial assimilation, as Ceres' own cult appears to have been considered more tractable and obedient than Liber's. Their Aventine cults, reported in later Roman sources as distinctively Greek in character, may have been further reinforced and influenced by their perceived similarities to particular Greek deities: Ceres to Demeter, Liber to Dionysus (Roman Bacchus) and Libera to Persephone (Roman Proserpina). In keeping with Roman theology, the internal and external equivalence of the Aventine Triad remained speculative, broad and flexible. Long after its establishment, Cicero rejects the equivalence of Liber and Dionysus and asserts that Ceres is mother to Liber and Libera.\n\nThe Aventine Triad was established soon after the overthrow of the Roman monarchy and establishment of the Republic. Rome's majority of citizen commoners (plebs) were ruled by the patricians, a small number of powerful, landed aristocrats who asserted a traditional, exclusive right to Rome's highest religious, political and military offices. The \"plebs\" not only served in Rome's legions: they were the backbone of its economy – smallholders, labourers, skilled specialists, managers of landed estates, vintners, importers and exporters of grain and wine. Against a background of famine in Rome, an imminent war against the Latins and a threatened plebeian secession, the dictator A. Postumius vowed a temple to the patron deities of the \"plebs\", Ceres, Liber and Libera on or near the Aventine Hill. The famine ended and Rome's plebeian citizen-soldiery co-operated in the conquest of the Latins. In 493 BC, a new built temple on or near the Aventine hill was dedicated to the Triad and Rome's first recorded \"ludi scaenici\" (religious dramas) were held in honour of Liber, for the benefit of the Roman people. Liber's festival, the Liberalia, may date from this time.\n\nPatrician dominance was manifest in the Capitoline Triad of Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus on the Capitoline Hill, at the heart of the city. The Capitoline temple lay within Rome's sacred boundary (pomerium). The Aventine lay outside it. In most versions of the Roman founding myth, this was the hill on which the unfortunate Remus lost to his brother Romulus in a contest of augury to decide Rome's foundation, name and leadership. Postumius' vow has been interpreted as a pragmatic, timely recognition of the plebeian citizenry as a distinct social and political grouping with its own values, interests and traditions; the vow may have intended confirmation of the plebs and their deities as fully Roman, but its fulfillment focused plebeian culture and identity on a Triad of deities only part-assimilated into official Roman religion. Some aspects of their cults were still considered morally \"un-Roman\" by Rome's authorities. Thus the Aventine Triad gave the \"plebs\" what has been variously described by modern historians as a parallel to the official Capitoline Triad, and its \"copy and antithesis\". Among other religious innovations based on his antiquarian interests, the emperor Claudius redrew the \"pomerium\" to encompass the Aventine.\n\nThe \"plebs\" continued to establish and administer their own laws (\"plebiscita\") and held formal assemblies from which patricians were excluded. They elected their own magistrates and sought religious confirmation of their decisions through their own augury, which in plebeian religious tradition had been introduced by Marsyas, a satyr or silen in the entourage of Liber. Meanwhile, the plebeian tribunes, an emergent plebeian nobility and a small but growing number of popularist politicians of patrician ancestry gained increasing influence over Rome's religious life and government. Any person who offended against the sacred rights and person of a plebeian tribune was liable to declaration as \"homo sacer\", who could be killed with impunity and whose property was, almost certainly, forfeit to Ceres. Even so, official \"Ludi Cereales\" were not established until as late as 202 BC. Liber's festival and the Bacchic or Dionysian aspects of his cult were suppressed under the ferocious \"Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus\" of 186 BC. The Liberalia rites were transferred to Cerealia; after a few years they were restored to Liber.\n\nVarro's complex, investigative Late Republican theology groups Ceres with Tellus and Venus, therefore (in Varronian reasoning) with Victoria; and Ceres with Libera, when the latter is understood as the female aspect of Liber.\n\nEvidence is lacking for the earliest priesthoods of the Aventine Triad, whether in joint or individual cult to its deities. The plebeian aediles, named after their service of aedes (shrine or temple) may have acted as cult priests for their community and may have served Liber and Libera in this capacity. Ceres was served by a flamen Cerealis, usually a plebeian. His duties included the invocation of her assistant deities and cult service to the earth-goddess Tellus. From ca. 205 BC, a joint mystery cult to Ceres and Proserpina was held at the Aventine Triad's temple, in addition to its older rites. This \"ritus graecus cereris\" recognised Libera as equivalent to Proserpina. Liber's involvement, if any, is unknown. Initiation was reserved to women, and the cult was served by priestesses of high social caste. According to Cicero, men were forbidden to look on Ceres' cult image; this could imply the use of separate cult images, or the use of the same images in different, gender-segregated rites.\n\nThe Aventine Triad's temple was known by the name of its leading deity – thus, Roman sources describe it as the Temple of Ceres, though within it, each deity had a separate internal sanctuary (\"cella\"). The temple served as a cult centre for the patron deities of the plebs, a sacred depository for plebeian records and the headquarters for the plebeian aediles; the minutes or conclusions of senatorial decrees were also placed there, under the protection of Ceres as the guardian of laws on behalf of the Roman people. While the original temple fabric and furnishings may have been funded in whole or part by its patrician sponsors, its cult images and perhaps its maintenance were supported partly through voluntary offerings and partly through the fines collected by the plebeian aediles from those who infringed plebeian civil and religious laws. By the late Republic, it may have fallen into disrepair: Augustus undertook its restoration, which was completed by his successor Tiberius. Pliny the Elder's later description of its style and designers as \"Greek\" are taken as further evidence of continued plebeian cultural connections with Magna Graecia, officially funded well into the Imperial era. No trace remains of the temple building, and the historical and epigraphical record offers only sparse details to suggest its exact location.\n"}
{"id": "9385789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9385789", "title": "B movies (exploitation boom)", "text": "B movies (exploitation boom)\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s mark the golden age of the independent B movie, made outside of Hollywood's major film studios. As censorship pressures lifted in the early 1960s, the low-budget end of the American motion picture industry increasingly incorporated the sort of sexual and violent elements long associated with so-called exploitation films. The death of the Production Code in 1968 and the major success of the exploitation-style \"Easy Rider\" the following year fueled the trend through the subsequent decade. The success of the B-studio exploitation movement had a significant effect on the strategies of the major studios during the 1970s.\n\nDespite the many transformations in the industry, the average production cost of an American feature film was effectively stable over the course of the 1950s. In 1950, the figure had been $1 million; in 1961, it reached $2 million—after adjusting for inflation, the increase in real terms was less than 10 percent. The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a subsequent-run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters. The dual genre-movie package, popularized by American International Pictures (AIP) the previous decade, was the new face of the double feature. In July 1960, the latest Joseph E. Levine sword-and-sandals import, \"Hercules Unchained\", opened at neighborhood theaters in New York. An 82-minute-long suspense film, \"Terror Is a Man\", produced by a Manila-based, American-Philippine company, ran as a \"co-feature.\" It had a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: \"The dénouement helpfully includes a 'warning bell' so the sensitive can 'close their eyes.'\" That year, Roger Corman took American International down a new road: \"When they asked me to make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color.\" A period piece in the vein of Britain's Hammer Films, \"House of Usher\" was a success, launching a series of Poe-based movies Corman would direct for AIP. It also typifies the continuing ambiguities of B-picture classification. \"House of Usher\" was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio, with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed. But from a latter-day perspective, it is regarded as a B movie—that schedule was a mere fifteen days, the budget just $200,000, one-tenth the industry average. Low-budget-movie aficionado John Reid reports once asking a neighborhood theater manager to define \"B picture.\" The response: \"Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes.\" \"House of Usher\"'s running time is close, 85 minutes. And despite its high status in studio terms, it was not sent out into the world on its own, but screened in tandem with a crime melodrama asking the eternal question \"Why Must I Die?\"\n\nWith the loosening of industry censorship constraints, the 1960s and 1970s saw a major expansion in the production and commercial viability of a variety of B-movie subgenres that have come to be known collectively as \"exploitation films\". The term gained broader application as well: Exploitation-style promotional practices had become standard practice at the lower-budget end of the industry; with the majors having exited traditional B production, \"exploitation\" became a way to refer to the entire field of low-budget genre films. The combination of intensive and gimmick-laden publicity with movies featuring vulgar subject matter (as judged by mainstream standards) along with often outrageous imagery dated back decades—before such milestones as \"The Tingler\" (1959), before \"Women in Bondage\" (1943), before even \"The Terror of Tiny Town\" (1938). \"Exploitation\" had originally defined truly fringe productions with a dose of shocking content, made at the lowest depths of Poverty Row or entirely outside the Hollywood system. Many graphically depicted the wages of sin in the context of promoting prudent lifestyle choices, particularly \"sexual hygiene.\" Audiences might see explicit footage of anything from a live birth to a ritual circumcision in such films. They were not generally booked as part of movie theaters' regular schedules but rather presented as special events by traveling roadshow promoters (they might also appear as fodder for \"grindhouses,\" which typically had no regular schedule at all). The most famous of those promoters, Kroger Babb, was in the vanguard of marketing low-budget, sensationalistic films with a \"100% saturation campaign,\" inundating the target audience with ads in almost any imaginable medium. In the era of the traditional double feature, no one would have characterized these exploitation films as \"B movies.\" As production and exhibition practices changed, so did the terms of definition.\n\nIn the early 1960s, exploitation movies in the original sense continued to appear: 1961's \"Damaged Goods\", a cautionary tale about a young lady whose boyfriend’s promiscuity leads to venereal disease, comes complete with enormous, grotesque closeups of VD's physical manifestations. At the same time, the concept of fringe exploitation was merging with a closely related and similarly venerable tradition: “nudie\" films featuring nudist-camp footage or striptease artists like Bettie Page had simply been the softcore pornography of previous decades. As far back as 1933, \"This Nude World\", which promised an \"Authentic Trip Through an American Nudist Colony!\", was \"Guaranteed the Most Educational Film Ever Produced!\" In the late 1950s, as more of the old grindhouse theaters specifically devoted themselves to \"adult\" product, a few filmmakers began making nudies with some greater semblance of plots. Best known was Russ Meyer, who released his first successful narrative nudie, \"The Immoral Mr. Teas\", in 1959. Five years later, on a sub-$100,000 budget, Meyer came out with \"Lorna\", \"a harder-edged film that combined sex with gritty realism and violence.\" Meyer would build an underground reputation as a talented director with movies such as \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" (1965) and \"Vixen!\" (1968), the sort of films, virtually ignored by the mainstream press, that had become known as sexploitation pictures. Another leading director in the genre was Joseph Sarno, who had his first commercial success in 1963 with \"Sin in the Suburbs\". Many of his subsequent films, including the artistically crafted \"Red Roses of Passion\" (1966) and \"Odd Triangle\" (1968), examined the hesitant transformation of sexual mores among the American middle class. Films such as Meyer's and Sarno's—though not sexually explicit during this period—were largely relegated to the fringe circuit of \"adult\" theaters, while AIP teen movies with wink-wink titles like \"Beach Blanket Bingo\" (1965) and \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini\" (1966), starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, played drive-ins and other relatively reputable venues. Roger Corman's \"The Trip\" (1967) for American International, written by veteran AIP/Corman actor Jack Nicholson, never shows a fully bared, unpainted breast, but flirts with nudity throughout. The Meyer and Corman lines were drawing closer.\n\nOne of the most influential films of the era, on B's and beyond, was Paramount's \"Psycho\". Its $8.5 million in earnings against a production cost of $800,000 made it the most profitable movie of 1960. Its mainstream distribution without the Production Code seal of approval helped weaken U.S. film censorship. And, as William Paul notes, this move into the horror genre by respected director Alfred Hitchcock was made, \"significantly, with the lowest-budgeted film of his American career and the least glamorous stars. [Its] greatest initial impact... was on schlock horror movies (notably those from second-tier director William Castle), each of which tried to bill itself as scarier than \"Psycho\".\" Castle's first film in the \"Psycho\" vein was \"Homicidal\" (1961), an early step in the development of the slasher subgenre that would flourish in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It seemed the less money available for a horror film, the better the chances of being grossed out by it: \"Blood Feast\" (1963), a movie about human dismemberment and culinary preparation made for approximately $24,000 by experienced nudie-maker Herschell Gordon Lewis, established a new, more immediately successful subgenre, the gore or splatter film. Lewis's business partner David F. Friedman drummed up publicity by distributing vomit bags to theatergoers (\"You May Need This When You See \"Blood Feast\"\")—the sort of gimmick Castle had become renowned for in the 1950s—and arranging for an injunction against the film in Sarasota, Florida—the sort of problem exploitation films had long run up against, except Friedman had planned it. Lewis and Friedman's efforts typify the emerging sense of \"exploitation\": the progressive adoption of traditional exploitation and nudie elements into horror, into other classic B genres, and into the low-budget film industry as a whole.\n\nDespite \"Psycho\"'s impact and the growing popularity of horror, major Hollywood studios largely continued to disdain the genre, at least for their own production lines. Along with the output of \"off-Hollywood\" U.S. concerns like Lewis and Friedman's, distributors brought in more foreign movies to fill the demands of rural drive-ins, lower-end urban theaters, and outright grindhouses. Hammer Films' success with \"The Curse of Frankenstein\" (1957) and its remake of \"Dracula\" (1958) had established the studio as an important supplier of horror movies to the American B market, a positioned it maintained throughout the 1960s. In 1961, American International released a movie clearly influenced by Hammer's characteristically bold visual style and moody pace—\"Black Sunday\" was a dubbed horror import from Italy, where it had premiered the previous year as \"La maschera del demonio\". It became the highest grossing film in AIP history. The movie's director was Mario Bava, who would launch the horror subgenre known as giallo with \"La ragazza che sapeva troppo\" (\"The Girl Who Knew Too Much\"; 1963) and \"Sei Donne per l’assassino\" (\"Blood and Black Lace\"; 1964). Many gialli, highly stylized films mixing sexploitation and ultraviolence, were picked up for U.S. B-market distribution and would prove influential on American horror films in turn, especially of the slasher type. While in the past, the term \"B movie\" had been applied, both in the United States and abroad, almost exclusively to low- and modest-budget American films, the growing Italian exploitation film industry now also became associated with the label (usually styled in Italy as \"B-movie\").\n\nThe Production Code was officially scrapped in 1968, to be replaced by the first version of the present-day rating system. That year, two horror films came out that heralded directions American filmmaking would take in the next decade, with major long-range consequences for the B film. One was a high-budget Paramount production, directed by the celebrated Roman Polanski and based on a bestselling novel by Ira Levin. Produced by B-horror veteran William Castle, \"Rosemary's Baby\" \"took the genre up-market for the first time since the 1930s.\" It was a critical success and the seventh-biggest box office hit of the year. The other was George A. Romero's now classic \"Night of the Living Dead\", produced on weekends in and around Pittsburgh for $114,000. Essentially a war movie pitting a small group of humans against a zombie corps, it built on the achievement of B-genre predecessors like \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" in its subtextual exploration of social and political issues. The movie doubled as both a highly effective thriller and an incisive allegory for America's treatment of the descendants of its former slaves at home and its conduct of a distant war against Vietnamese nationalists. Its greatest influence, though, derived not from its ideological implications but rather its clever subversion of genre clichés and the connection made between its exploitation-style imagery, its low-cost, truly independent means of production, and its high rate of return: $3 million in earnings in 1968, with much more to come as it was revived in various fashions.\n\nWith the Production Code gone and the X rating established, major studio A films like \"Midnight Cowboy\" could now show \"adult\" imagery, while the market for increasingly hardcore pornography exploded. In this transformed commercial context, work like Russ Meyer's gained a new legitimacy. In 1969, for the first time a Meyer film, \"Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers!\", was reviewed in \"The New York Times\". Soon, Corman would be putting out nudity-filled sexploitation pictures such as \"The Student Nurses\" (1970) and \"Women in Cages\" (1971). With \"The Vampire Lovers\" (1970), Hammer similarly launched \"a cycle of lesbian vampire movies that bordered on soft porn.\"\n\nIn May 1969, the most important of all exploitation movies premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. Much of \"Easy Rider\"'s significance owes to the fact that it was produced for a respectable, if still modest, budget and released by a major studio. The project was first taken by one of its cocreators, Peter Fonda, to American International. Fonda had become AIP's top star in the Corman–directed \"The Wild Angels\" (1966), a biker movie, and \"The Trip\", as in LSD. The idea Fonda pitched would combine those two proven themes. AIP was intrigued but balked at giving his collaborator, Dennis Hopper—who had appeared in \"The Trip\" and several other AIP opuses—free directorial rein. The duo then took their concept, for which they had projected a $60,000 budget, to producer Bert Schneider. Suggesting that they would have an easier time raising $600,000, Schneider helped arrange a financing and distribution deal with Columbia Pictures, where his brother was president. Two more graduates of the Corman/AIP exploitation mill joined the project: Jack Nicholson and cinematographer László Kovács. The film (which managed to incorporate another favorite exploitation theme, the redneck menace, as well as a fair amount of nudity) was brought in at a cost of $501,000. \"Easy Rider\" would earn $19.1 million in rentals, becoming, as one history puts it, \"the seminal film that provided the bridge between all the repressed tendencies represented by schlock/kitsch/hack since the dawn of Hollywood and the mainstream cinema of the seventies.\"\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new generation of low-budget film companies emerged that drew from all the different lines of exploitation as well as the sci-fi and teen themes that had been a mainstay since the 1950s. Operations such as Roger Corman's New World Pictures, Cannon Films, New Line Cinema, Film Ventures International, Fanfare Films, and Independent-International Pictures brought exploitation films to mainstream theaters around the country. The major studios' top product was continuing to inflate in running time—in 1970, the ten biggest earners averaged 140.1 minutes. The B's were keeping pace: In 1955, Corman had a producorial hand in five movies averaging 74.8 minutes, with a range between 69 and 79. He played a similar part in five films originally released in 1970, two for AIP and three for his own New World, including an Italian horror film that he purchased for around $25,000: the average length was 89.8 minutes, with a range between 86 and 94. These films could turn a tidy profit. The first New World release, the biker movie \"Angels Die Hard\", cost $117,000 to produce. It was no \"Easy Rider\", but its box-office take of $2 million–plus meant a 46 percent return for New World's investors.\n\nIn addition to the startups, the growth of exploitation in the 1970s also involved the leading studio in the low-budget field. In 1973, American International gave a shot to director Brian De Palma, whose previous movie, a Warner Bros. comedy, had flopped badly. Reviewing \"Sisters\", De Palma's first horror film, \"New Yorker\" critic Pauline Kael observed that its \"limp technique doesn't seem to matter to the people who want their gratuitous gore. The movie supplies it, but why is there so much gratuitous dumbness too?... [H]e can't get two people talking in order to make a simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938.\" Many examples of the so-called blaxploitation genre of the early and middle part of the decade, featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP. One of blaxploitation's biggest stars was Pam Grier, who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer's \"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\" (1970) and who had appeared in several New World pictures, including \"The Big Doll House\" (1971) and \"The Big Bird Cage\" (1972), both directed by Jack Hill. Hill also directed her best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: \"Coffy\" (1973) and \"Foxy Brown\" (1974). Grier has the distinction of starring in the first widely distributed movie to climax with a castration scene.\n\nBlaxploitation was the first exploitation genre to picked up by the major studios in a substantial way. Indeed, the United Artists release \"Cotton Comes to Harlem\" (1970), directed by Ossie Davis, is seen as the first significant film of the type. Crossing over before the genre had even gotten established, Laurence Merrick's micro-budget independent \"The Black Angels\" (aka \"Black Bikers from Hell\"; 1970) followed by a few months. But the movie regarded as truly igniting the blaxploitation phenomenon, again completely independent, came the following year: \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\" is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form—wildly experimental in style, borderline pornographic (\"Rated X by an All White Jury,\" declared the ads), and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution. Melvin Van Peebles wrote, co-produced, directed, starred in, edited, and composed the music for the film, which was completed with the last-minute help of a $50,000 loan from Bill Cosby. It premiered in April 1971, distributed by Cinemation Industries, a small company then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian \"Mondo Cane\" \"shockumentaries\" and the Swedish skin flick \"Fanny Hill\", as well as for its one in-house production, \"The Man from O.R.G.Y.\" (1970). These were the sort of films that played in the \"grindhouses\" of the day—many of them not outright porno theaters, but rather specializing in all manner of exploitation cinema. As director Quentin Tarantino describes in a 2007 interview, \"Grindhouses were usually in the ghetto. Or they were the big old downtown movie theaters that sometimes stayed open all night long, for all the bums. At the grindhouse that I went to, every week there was the new kung fu movie, or new car-chase movie, or new sexploitation movie, or blaxploitation movie.\" The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone, but a continuity of spirit was evident.\n\nIn 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in 16 mm by a first-time American director won the international critics' prize at the Venice Film Festival. \"Wanda\", written and directed by Barbara Loden, is both a seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture. The plot—involving a disaffected divorcée who drifts away from her coal-town life and aimlessly falls in with a small-time, would-be hardboiled crook—and the often seedy settings would have been suitable to a straightforward exploitation film or (with a little shifting of sex roles) an old-school B noir. Loden, who spent six years raising money for the sub-$200,000 production, created a film that Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" praised for \"the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and the kind of purity of technique that can only be the result of conscious discipline.\" While \"Wanda\" would be the only movie Loden ever made, she \"left us with a film that anticipated the independent spirit that would reinvigorate the industry.\"\n\nLike Romero and Van Peebles, other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut-level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary. The first three features directed by Larry Cohen, \"Bone\" (aka \"Beverly Hills Nightmare\"; 1972), \"Black Caesar\" (1973), and \"Hell Up in Harlem\" (1973), were all nominally blaxploitation movies, but Cohen—also the screenwriter on each film—used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog-eat-dog capitalism. Cohen's \"The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover\" (1977), for AIP, might have \"the look of tabloid sleaze,\" but one leading critic found it \"perhaps the most intelligent film about American politics ever to come out of Hollywood.\" The gory horror film \"Deathdream\" (aka \"Dead of Night\"; 1974), directed by Bob Clark and written by Alan Orsmby, is also an agonized protest of the war in Vietnam. Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg made serious-minded low-budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential: \"Shivers\" (1975), \"Rabid\" (1977), and \"The Brood\" (1979) all involve a degree of self-reflexiveness that, as William Paul points out, \"makes Cronenberg's status as a genre director somewhat odd... His works foreground their meaningfulness in a way that is unusual for the horror film.\" An \"Easy Rider\" with conceptual rigor, the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was the biker-themed \"Electra Glide in Blue\" (1973), a United Artists release directed by James William Guercio. Critical admiration was hardly universal at the time: Roger Greenspun of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Under different intentions, it might have made a decent grade-C Roger Corman bike movie—though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio.\"\n\nThe horror field continued to attract young, independent American directors whose work would prove especially influential. As critic Roger Ebert explained in one 1974 movie review, \"Horror and exploitation films almost always turn a profit if they're brought in at the right price. So they provide a good starting place for ambitious would-be filmmakers who can't get more conventional projects off the ground.\" The particular movie under consideration was \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\". Written and directed by Tobe Hooper, it was made on a budget of somewhere between $93,000 and $250,000. It would earn $14.4 million in domestic rentals and become one of the most influential horror films of the decade. John Carpenter, whose debut feature, the $60,000 sci-fi comedy \"Dark Star\" (1974), had become a cult classic, made his lasting mark four years later. \"Halloween\" (1978), produced for $320,000, grossed over $80 million at the box-office worldwide, making it \"the most successful 'indie' movie ever released.\" The film effectively established the slasher mode as the primary expression of the horror genre for the next decade. Just as Hooper had learned from Romero's landmark \"Night of the Living Dead\", \"Halloween\", in turn, largely followed the model of \"Black Christmas\", directed by \"Deathdream\"'s Bob Clark.\n\nThe impact of these films still echoes through such movies as the \"Saw\" series, including 2006's \"Saw III\", a mainstream, $10 million production—far below the current Hollywood average, but more than a hundred times Hooper's budget and well out of any true independent's league.\nIn various ways, the B movies of the era have inspired later filmmakers blessed with much better financial backing. Almost all the works of Quentin Tarantino—in particular, \"Jackie Brown\" (1997), the \"Kill Bill\" movies (2003–4), and his \"Death Proof\" segment of \"Grindhouse\" (2007)—pay explicit tribute to classic exploitation cinema. Blaxploitation is directly homaged by the former, while the \"Kill Bill\" pictures reference a wide variety of Asian martial arts films, which appeared as imports in U.S. theaters regularly during the 1970s. These \"kung fu\" films as they were often called, whatever specific martial art was featured, were popularized in the United States by the Hong Kong–produced movies of Bruce Lee. His films and later ones with such stars as Hong Kong's Jackie Chan and Japan's Sonny Chiba were marketed to the same genre/exploitation audience targeted by AIP and New World. \"Death Proof\" is inspired by a range of exploitation styles, particularly giallo/slasher pictures and car-chase movies like 20th Century-Fox's \"Vanishing Point\" (1971) and \"Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry\" (1974) and New World's \"Cannonball\" (1976) and \"Grand Theft Auto\" (1977).\n\nIn the early 1970s, the growing practice of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, with the goal of building a cult film audience, made the midnight movie a significant new mode of cinematic exhibition, with transgressive connotations. Socializing in a countercultural milieu was part of the original attraction of the midnight filmgoing experience, something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new midnight movie circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old \"Night of the Living Dead\". The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside of the studio system, like John Waters' \"Pink Flamingos\" (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century-Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B-picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as \"Rocky Horror\" generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.\n\nOn television, the parallels between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear. In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. While there had been dramatic feature presentations made especially for TV since the beginning of the medium's mass commercialization in the late 1940s, they had by and large not crossed over with the realm of the B movie. In the 1950s, the live television drama—a unique amalgam of cinematic and theatrical elements exemplified by \"Playhouse 90\" (1956–1961)—had predominated. Over the course of the 1960s, there was a transition to prerecorded features; most of those produced by the major networks either aspired to the prestige of major motion pictures (e.g., CBS's 1965 \"Cinderella\") or were intended as pilots for projected series. During this period, AIP produced a number of low-grade genre pictures such as \"Zontar, the Thing from Venus\" (1966) intended for the first-run TV syndication market.\n\nAs production of TV movies expanded with the introduction of the \"ABC Movie of the Week\" in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original feature presentations, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B-picture territory. In a 1974 \"Time\" article, \"The New B Movies,\" Richard Schickel begins by discussing a few recent high-priced TV features, only to argue that\n\nas with the old films, so with TV movies: the quick, deft westerns, mysteries and action melodramas that depend on well-established conventions may in the end exert a larger claim on our attention than their more pretentiously publicized rivals... Convenient to turn on, easy to flick off, movies made for TV approximate the conditions under which all movies used to be chanced by audiences years ago...when at least half the pleasure of moviegoing derived precisely from the fact that no sense of cultural occasion was attached to that simple, inexpensive act.\n\nWhile many TV films of the 1970s were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production, the small screen also saw a revival of the B melodrama. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as ABC's \"The Ordeal of Patty Hearst\", which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened all the way back to the 1920s and such movies as \"Human Wreckage\" and \"When Love Grows Cold\", pictures from low-budget studio FBO made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Some TV movies, such as \"Nightmare in Badham County\" (ABC; 1976), headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.\n\nThe reverberations of \"Easy Rider\" could be felt in \"Nightmare in Badham County\", as well as in a host of big-screen exploitation films of the era. But perhaps its greatest influence on the fate of the B movie was less direct. By 1973, the major studios were clearly catching on to the commercial potential of genres that had once been consigned to the bargain basement. \"Rosemary's Baby\" had shown that a well-packaged horror \"special\" could be a box-office hit, but it had little in common with the exploitation style. Warner Bros.' \"The Exorcist\", directed by William Friedkin, was a different story. It showed that a heavily promoted and distributed film in the genre could be an absolute blockbuster. And more: In William Paul's description, \"it is the film that really established gross-out as a mode of expression for mainstream cinema... [P]ast exploitation films managed to exploit their cruelties by virtue of their marginality. \"The Exorcist\" made cruelty respectable. By the end of the decade, the exploitation booking strategy of opening films simultaneously in hundreds to thousands of theaters became standard industry practice.\" It was the biggest movie of the year and by far the highest-earning horror movie yet made. On behalf of its genre, Universal's \"American Graffiti\" did something similar. Released when writer-director George Lucas was twenty-nine years old, it is described by Paul as \"essentially an American-International teenybopper pic with a lot more spit and polish\"—a combination that made it the third biggest movie of 1973 and, likewise, by far the highest-earning teen-themed movie yet made. A-budgeted B-themed movies of even greater historical import would follow in their wake.\n\n"}

{"id": "497025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=497025", "title": "Buddy system", "text": "Buddy system\n\nThe buddy system is a procedure in which two people, the \"buddies\", operate together as a single unit so that they are able to monitor and help each other.\nAs per Merriam-Webster, the first known use of the phrase “buddy system” goes as far back as 1942. Webster goes on to define the buddy system as “an arrangement in which two individuals are paired (as for mutual safety in a hazardous situation).” \nThe buddy system is basically working together in pairs in a large group or alone. Both the individuals have to do the job. The job could be to ensure that the work is finished safely or the skill/learning is transferred effectively from one individual to the other.\n\nIn adventurous or dangerous activities, where buddies are often required, the main benefit of the system is improved safety; each may be able to prevent the other becoming a casualty or rescue the other in a crisis.\n\nWhen this system is used as part of training or the induction of newcomers to an organization, the less experienced buddy learns more quickly from close and frequent contact with the experienced buddy than when operating alone.\n\nThe buddy system is used in the United States Armed Forces, and referred to by various names in each branch (\"Wingmen\" in the Air Force, \"Battle Buddies\" in the Army, \"Shipmates\" in the Navy), as well as the Boy Scouts of America and the Girl Scouts of the USA\n\nIt is also used by religious organisations like the LDS Church. Members on mission form a companionship constituted by two or sometimes more missionaries, which are not allowed to be alone for a two-year time period: \"Stay Together. Never be alone. It is extremely important that you stay with your companion at all times.\"\n\nThe buddy system is used in new employee induction for assisting with the formalities in an organization. The period could be from a month to two months. The buddy helps in acclimatizing the new employee to the culture and day to day aspects of working, in a shorter period of time. The buddy helps the new employee to become knowledgeable about department practices and organizational culture in a shorter period. The purpose of assigning new employees with a buddy is to help welcome employees and reaffirms their decision to join the organization. It provides new employees with a reliable, motivated, single point-of-contact for their basic questions regarding their work experience. The buddy system is an effective method to provide support, monitor stress, and reinforce safety procedures.\n\nThe buddy system is also informally used by school-aged children, especially on field trips. Assigning each student a buddy provides an extra measure of safety and removes some of the burden of keeping an eye on a large number of children in an unfamiliar environment from the supervising adults.\n\nThe buddy system encourages open and effective dialogue among peers and tends to break down social barriers with their classmates. It helps create a collaborative learning environment in which peers feel less hesitant to raise questions. This enables students to develop social networks, cross-cultural experiences. It provides effective support for the students who are ‘at risk’ and to lower the attrition rate at the higher education level.\n\nA buddy system in a school is where a child gets paired with another child, usually one that is older and of higher abilities. A buddy system helps to promote friendship, better support of coursework, behavioral and social needs, and can foster a greater sense of belonging and a more inclusive school community. Students create friendships that enable both older and younger \"buddies\" to bond more closely with their school, increasing the likelihood of more positive school behavior and positive response towards learning for all students. The buddy system helps students starting at a new school have a welcoming experience from the very beginning. The older children learn to take on responsibility, while the younger children know that they have a fellow student they can confidently turn to for support.\nBuddy systems in schools can have numerous benefits such as promoting an inclusive environment for all, better acceptance of differences, promoting better self-control, expansion of communicative interaction with peers, decrease in behavioral problems, and even personal maturation or growth in career aspirations.\nThe buddy system positively affects the culture of the school and it greatly affects the troubled student as well as the older buddy.\nThe students learn and share from their peers and learn collaboratively. The students actively participate with each other and enjoy the informal setting and feel comfortable discussing with peers rather than a teacher. The opportunity for active participation, clearing doubts and discussions help students to continue with studies or activities with joy and creates a depth in the subject matter. The buddy system helps to increase self-confidence for all involved in the system and in the process helps build trust and co-operation within individuals. It benefits the buddies, buddy learner, school/university and the parents as well. The buddies involved also learn leadership skills and in turn can take up the role of buddy leader. \nThe buddy system helps in reducing the stress level of the learner. It reduces the levels of anxiety experienced by the students who struggle to engage with course material or with the school/university in general. \"When there's a companion available, the physiological measure of stress—cortisol levels in the blood—can be alleviated somewhat\", explains Jim Winslow, PhD, a specialist in behavioral neuroscience and pharmacology and head of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Intramural Research Program, Non-Human Primate Core.\nTeachers at progressive schools collaborate to improve their students' learning—and their own. It gives independence to all students, and increases self-esteem and peer acceptance. Children become protectors of each other.\nChristine Hogan states that the buddy system approach is highly appropriate for organizational behavior studies adding to the students' range of learning strategies. The technique not only works with peers of the same nation but has also proved to be of particular importance to foreign students.\n\nThere are numerous pairings styles: newly admitted students paired with older students, low achieving elementary school students paired with high achieving elementary school students; behaviorally challenged teenagers paired with adults; autistic children paired with neurotypical children; severely disabled children paired with neurotypical children; and even college students paired with post-bachelor students.\n\nAn example of a successful peer buddy system was in Nashville, Tennessee's McGavock High School. Teachers were concerned with having a more inclusive environment for special education students. Not only were the specialized students excluded academically but there was social exclusion as well. This adversely affects specialized students when there is a need for them to later assimilate when out of high school. Students with disabilities were eating with their buddies and their friends, which resulted in the expansion of their circle of friendship and thus allowed for the special needs students to feel more normal and included. The program was so successful it was later adopted in the other 11 high schools of that district.\n\nThere are more examples of buddy systems for developmentally challenged students than there are of students with normal development but with behavioral or academic needs. If a system can be implemented that can help autistic or behaviorally challenged children or children with intellectual disabilities, than similar buddy systems can be incorporated into mainstream classrooms to help aid students that have a hard time learning but who may not qualify for the special needs programs. Students with disabilities report feeling more included, able to start friendships and conversations, and these same benefits can be transferred over to students that have social problems but are not able to be in special needs programs. Similarly, a student who is struggling academically can be paired with someone more adept with certain subjects.\n\nPeer buddy groups can benefit many people. More research is needed to understand the possible impact of buddy systems for the general student population. Students that qualify for special services receive a lot of attention but students struggling behaviorally and socially would highly benefit from such an inclusive service.\n\nStudents that qualify for special needs services receive a lot of attention. For the students that do not qualify but might be struggling behaviorally and socially, then programs like these could potentially have similar benefits for them as well. Carolyn Hughes and Erik Carter promote a more ubiquitous peer buddy system in their book by laying out different strategies and benefits if schools were to include these systems in their curriculum. Examples they provide are: administrators assisting in the publication of the program, school counselors signing up students for a credit based buddy system course, general education teachers providing support for special needs students who might be in there classroom and having parents providing impetus and support for a program to begin. Carolyn Hughes and Erik Carter suggest starting on a smaller scale, perhaps a classroom or two and then growing a base of support.\n\nA key element of education is to build empathy and understand other people in the society. This approach sees a small group of students in a class being made \"buddies\" for an autistic student. The students are made aware of particular challenge a student has and are asked to take special care to include them, to be on the lookout for any bullying or exclusion and to be supportive to the student if they get stressed out or upset at break time or in class. The students who are selected would be chosen for their maturity and kindness. Parental consent would be sought from the parents of the students involved. While not every autistic student will instantly begin to socialise or make friends, this approach will at the very least ensure inclusion and also that there will be a friendly pair of eyes when teachers are not present or are out of ear-shot. Everyone needs a buddy sometimes – maybe a student is having a bad day, is upset about something or just is not very good at starting conversations or making friends alone. Under this system, a class would explore difference as a whole and recognize that everyone in a class is different and so have different needs, strengths, abilities and oddities. They would then either be paired up or each student would draw a name and become \"buddy\" to that person, perhaps without them even being made aware of it. Before the draw or pairing it could be discussed with the teacher, to ensure an autistic student gets an especially strong buddy.\nThe advantage of this system is that it does not single out the autistic student, especially if they are not comfortable with that, and instead includes everyone. Additionally, it gives the autistic person a role in being a buddy too, which can be used to teach social skills, expectations and etiquette.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8408318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8408318", "title": "Cretan School", "text": "Cretan School\n\nCretan School describes an important school of icon painting, under the umbrella of post-Byzantine art, which flourished while Crete was under Venetian rule during the late Middle Ages, reaching its climax after the Fall of Constantinople, becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The Cretan artists developed a particular style of painting under the influence of both Eastern and Western artistic traditions and movements; the most famous product of the school, El Greco, was the most successful of the many artists who tried to build a career in Western Europe, and also the one who left the Byzantine style farthest behind him in his later career.\n\nThere was a substantial demand for Byzantine icons in Europe throughout the Middle Ages and, as a Venetian possession since 1204, Crete had a natural advantage and soon came to dominate the supply. A probable early example is the famous icon of the Virgin in Rome known as Our Mother of Perpetual Help, which was certainly well known in Rome by 1499. At this date there is little to distinguish Cretan work from other Byzantine icons stylistically, and the quality of work is lower than that associated with Constantinople.\n\nThis period also saw considerable numbers of wall-paintings in local churches and monasteries - altogether some 850 from the 14th and 15th centuries survive in Crete, far more than from earlier or later periods.\n\nBy the late 15th century, Cretan artists had established a distinct icon-painting style, distinguished by \"the precise outlines, the modelling of the flesh with dark brown underpaint and dense tiny highlights on the cheeks of the faces, the bright colours in the garments, the geometrical treatment of the drapery, and, finally the balanced articulation of the composition\", or \"sharp contours, slim silhouettes, linear draperies and restrained movements\". The most famous artist of the period was Andreas Ritzos\n(c. 1421–1492), whose son Nicholas was also well known. Angelos Akotantos, until recently thought to be a conservative painter of the 17th century, is now, after the discovery of a will dated 1436, seen to have been an innovative artist in fusing Byzantine and Western styles, who survived until about 1457, when the will was actually registered. The will was made in anticipation of a voyage to Constantinople; several icons were bequeathed to church institutions, some Catholic but mainly Orthodox, and the disposition of his stock of pattern drawings was carefully specified. Andreas Pavias (d. after 1504) and his pupil Angelos Bizamanos, and Nicholas Tzafuris (d. before 1501) were other leading artists.\n\nEven before the fall of Constantinople there is evidence that leading Byzantine artists were leaving the capital in order to settle in Crete. The migration of Byzantine artists to Crete continued increasingly the next years and reached its peak after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, when Crete became \"the most important centre of art in the Greek world\", influencing artistic developments in the rest of the Greek world. Cretan icons were commissioned for monasteries on Mount Athos and elsewhere. The Cretan school had a smaller rival; until it fell to the Turks in 1522, Rhodes also had a community of artists, but not so large or significant. \nThe Venetian archives preserve considerable documentation on the trade of artistic icons between Venice and Crete, which by the end of the 15th century had become one of mass production. There is documentation of a specific order in 1499, of 700 icons of the Virgin, 500 in a Western style, and 200 in Byzantine style. The order was placed with three artists by two dealers, one Venetian and one from mainland Greece, and the time between contract date and delivery was set at only forty-five days. Probably the quality of many such commissioned icons was fairly low, and the dismissive term Madonneri was devised to describe such bulk painters, who later practised in Italy also, often using a quasi-Byzantine style, and apparently often Greek or Dalmatian individuals. Production of icons at these levels seems to have led to a glut in the market, and in the following two decades there is much evidence that the Cretan trade declined significantly, as the European demand had been reduced. But at the top end of the market Cretan icons were now the finest in the Byzantine world.\n\nAbout 120 artists can be documented working in Candia (the Venetian name of Chandax, present day Herakleion), in the period 1453–1526, and they had organized a \"Schuola di San Luca\" painter's guild, based on the Italian model. The blending of the Eastern and the Western traditions, and a relaxed interchange between Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic rites led to the \"Cretan Renaissance\", a golden period for the arts on the island, where both literature and painting flourished. Some of these painters chose to continue the Byzantine tradition of Constantinople, while others were influenced by the masters of the Venetian Renaissance, such as Giovanni Bellini and Titian. Later Veronese was to be a particular influence. Works by these masters or copies were in monasteries and churches of the island, while examples of Early Netherlandish painting decorated the Catholic churches of Candia or were to be found in the private collections of rich Venetians and Greeks. In particular, Candia contained a large Franciscan church and a large Orthodox monastery, a daughter-house of Saint Catherine's Monastery, both of which had strong collections from their respective traditions.\n\nContemporary documents refer to two styles in painting: the \"maniera greca\" (\"alla greca\", in line with the Byzantine idiom) and the \"maniera Latina\" (\"alla Latina\", in accordance with Western techniques), which artists knew and utilized according to the circumstances; as a result some kind of \"eclecticism\" appeared. Indeed, sometimes both styles could be found in the same icon, the one right next to the other. The fame of the most prominent Cretan painters spread throughout Greece, the Mediterranean and Europe. After the beginning of the 16th century, the Cretan artists once again had more commissions and their works were avidly sought, since they had started to use new motives and to adjust their iconography to the new trends of their era. To an extent quantity was probably replaced by quality compared with the previous century.\n\nApart from El Greco, the most famous Cretan artists during the century were Theophanis Strelitzas (Θεοφάνης Στρελίτζας), known as Theophanes the Cretan, Michael Damaskenos (Μιχαήλ Δαμασκηνός), and Georgios Klontzas (Γεώργιος Κλόντζας). Various members of the Lambardos family were also significant artists. Fortunately for art historians, many Cretan painters adopted the practice, perhaps as early as Western painters, of signing their work, which was not a traditional Byzantine practice.\n\nTheophanes the Cretan was a relatively conservative Cretan artist, whose first dated work is from 1527, and all of whose known works were done on the mainland or smaller islands. He was the most important Greek wall painter of his day, incorporating some Western iconographic and stylistic elements, but remaining essentially Byzantine in spirit.\n\nThe intellectual and artistic personality of the young El Greco was formed in this artistic environment. In 1563, at the age of twenty-two, El Greco was described in a document as a \"master\" (\"maestro Domenigo\"), meaning he was already an enrolled master of the local guild, presumably in charge of his own workshop. He left for Venice a few years later, and never returned to Crete. His \"Dormition of the Virgin\", of before 1567 in tempera and gold on panel (61,4 x 45 cm, Holy Cathedral of the Dormition of the Virgin, Hermoupolis, Syros) was probably created near the end of El Greco's Cretan period. The painting combines post-Byzantine and Italian Mannerist stylistic and iconographic elements, and incorporates stylistic elements of the Cretan School.\n\nDuring the second half of the 16th century, many Cretan artists went to Venice, in the hope of gaining commissions and recognition. Unlike El Greco, the other Cretan painters who moved there did not substantially alter their styles or working methods. They simply incorporated more Italian motifs into a consistent Byzantine framework. Jonathan Brown provides a perceptive analysis of the ways that El Greco distinguished himself from other Cretan artists active in Venice, while Richard Mann argues that \"none of these painters accepted Renaissance ideas about the relevance of change to the creation of art works\". Michael Damaskenos returned to Crete after three years, and remained there for the rest of his life.\n\nProminent representatives of the Cretan School during the 17th century were Father Emmanuel Tzanes (Εμμανουήλ Τζάνες, 1610–1690), Emmanuel Lambardos and Theodoros Poulakis (Θεόδωρος Πουλάκης, 1622–1692). The Cretan icon painters continued to flourish, until the mid-century, when the Ottoman Turks occupied all the island except for Candia, which finally fell after twenty years of siege in 1669. After the Ottoman occupation of Crete, the centre of Greek painting moved to the Ionian Islands, which remained under Venetian rule until the Napoleonic Wars. A new artistic movement was created called the Heptanese School which was mostly influenced by Western European artistic trends. Many Cretan artists migrated to the Heptanese or Western Europe to enjoy the artistic freedom. A successive occupation of the Ionian islands by the French and the British allowed the Heptanese to remain the centre of Greek Art until the independence of Greece in 1830.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In an early 1980s interview, Only claimed that the devilock was based on a \"tidal wave\" hairstyle seen among the 1970s skateboarding communities. In the same interview, former Misfits vocalist Glenn Danzig explains that his version of the hairstyle developed from an imitation of Eddie Munster's hairstyle. A style similar to the Devilock was sported earlier - for instance the Surfari's cover picture of 'Gum-dipped Slicks' (1964) shows a member of the band with a devilock-like quiff .\n\nIn a devilock, the sides and back of the hair are kept short, while the front is kept long and combed forward. In the late 1990s, the devilock experienced a resurgence of popularity in Asian markets that saw the hairstyle spread from punk rock to mainstream culture. Following popularization in Japanese and Chinese rock groups, the hairstyle's name was appropriated by Noriaki Endo in his chain of retail clothing stores.

{"id": "11091078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11091078", "title": "Dragon Ball", "text": "Dragon Ball\n\n, sometimes styled as \"Dragonball\", is a Japanese media franchise created by Akira Toriyama in 1984. The initial manga, written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 \"tankōbon\" volumes by its publisher Shueisha. \"Dragon Ball\" was initially inspired by the classical Chinese novel \"Journey to the West\". The series follows the adventures of the protagonist, Son Goku, from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several friends and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls.\n\nToriyama's manga was adapted and divided into two anime series produced by Toei Animation: \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Dragon Ball Z\", which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed 19 animated feature films and three television specials, as well as two anime sequel series titled \"Dragon Ball GT\" (1996–1997) and \"Dragon Ball Super\" (2015–2018). From 2009 to 2015, a revised version of \"Dragon Ball Z\" aired in Japan under the title \"Dragon Ball Kai\", as a recut that follows the manga's story more faithfully by removing most of the material featured exclusively in the anime. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films, both animated and live-action, collectible trading card games, numerous action figures, along with several collections of soundtracks and a large number of video games. , the franchise has generated over in merchandise sales. \"Dragon Ball\" is one of the top ten highest-grossing media franchises of all time, as of 2018.\n\nSince its release, \"Dragon Ball\" has become one of the most successful manga and anime series of all time. The manga's 42 volumes have sold over 159million copies in Japan and over 350million copies worldwide, making it the second best-selling manga series in history. Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humour of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest manga series ever made, with many manga artists citing \"Dragon Ball\" as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works. The anime, particularly \"Dragon Ball Z\", is also highly popular in various countries and was arguably one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture.\n\nAkira Toriyama loosely modeled \"Dragon Ball\" on the classic Chinese novel \"Journey to the West\"; but also redeveloped it from his 1983 one-shot manga \"Dragon Boy\". He has said that the fighting was influenced from movies by famous martial arts actor Jackie Chan, as he wanted to create a story with the basic theme of \"Journey to the West\", but with \"a little kung fu.\" Toriyama was a fan of Hong Kong martial arts films such as \"Enter the Dragon\" and \"Drunken Master\" in particular.\n\nSince it was serialized in a shōnen magazine, he added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give it a game-like activity of gathering something, without thinking of what the characters would wish for. With Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Tang Sanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, he originally thought it would last about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected. Toriyama stated that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed \"Dragon Ball\" at readers older than those of his previous serial \"Dr. Slump\". He also wanted to break from the Western influences common in \"Dr. Slump\", deliberately going for Chinese scenery, referencing Chinese buildings and photographs of China his wife had bought. The island where the is held is modeled after Bali, which he, his wife and assistant visited in mid-1985, and for the area around Bobbidi's spaceship he consulted photos of Africa.\nDuring the early chapters of the manga Toriyama's editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, commented that Goku looked rather plain, so to combat this he added several characters like Kame-Sen'nin and Kuririn, and created the Tenkaichi Budōkai martial arts tournament to focus the storyline on fighting. It was when the first Tenkaichi Budōkai began that \"Dragon Ball\" truly became popular, having recalled the races and tournaments in \"Dr. Slump\". Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the video game \"Spartan X\", in which enemies tended to appear very fast. He then created Piccolo Daimao as a truly evil villain, and as a result called that arc the most interesting to draw.\n\nOnce Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the ; and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby. Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\" Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger. He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo. After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.\n\nGoing against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of \"Dragon Ball\" most powerful characters with small statures, including the protagonist, Goku. Toriyama later explained that he had Goku grow up as a means to make drawing fight scenes easier, even though his first editor Kazuhiko Torishima was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically. When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings. Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story, resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series, including changing the colors of the characters mid-story and few characters having screentone because he found it difficult to use. Since the completion of \"Dragon Ball\", Toriyama has continued to add to its story, mostly background information on its universe, through guidebooks published by Shueisha.\n\nDuring the second half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more interested in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines. In 2013, he stated that because \"Dragon Ball\" is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art. He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an \"unconventional and contradictory\" story. In 2013, commenting on \"Dragon Ball\"s global success, Toriyama said, \"Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.\", \"The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I dare say I don't care even if [my works] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers.\"\n\nWritten and illustrated by Akira Toriyama, \"Dragon Ball\" was serialized in the manga anthology \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" from December 3, 1984 to June 5, 1995, when Toriyama grew exhausted and felt he needed a break from drawing. The 519 individual chapters were published into 42 \"tankōbon\" volumes by Shueisha from September 10, 1985 through August 4, 1995. Between December 4, 2002 and April 2, 2004, the chapters were re-released in a collection of 34 \"kanzenban\" volumes, which included a slightly rewritten ending, new covers, and color artwork from its \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" run. The February 2013 issue of \"V Jump\", which was released in December 2012, announced that parts of the manga will be fully colored and re-released in 2013. Twenty volumes, beginning from chapter 195 and grouped by story arcs, were released between February 4, 2013 and July 4, 2014. Twelve volumes covering the first 194 chapters were published between January 4 and March 4, 2016. A \"sōshūhen\" edition that aims to recreate the manga as it was originally serialized in \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" with color pages, promotional text, and next chapter previews, was published in eighteen volumes between May 13, 2016 and January 13, 2017.\n\nAnother manga penned by Ōishi, the three-chapter \"\" that revolves around Bardock, Goku's father, was published in the monthly magazine \"V Jump\" from August and October 2011.\n\nThe final chapter of Toriyama's 2013 manga series \"Jaco the Galactic Patrolman\" revealed that it is set before \"Dragon Ball\", with several characters making appearances. \"Jaco\" collected volumes contain a bonus \"Dragon Ball\" chapter depicting Goku's mother.\n\nIn December 2016, a spin-off manga titled \"Dragon Ball Side Story: The Case of Being Reincarnated as Yamcha\" began in Shueisha's \"Shōnen Jump+\" digital magazine. Written and illustrated by Dragon Garow Lee, it is about a high school boy who after an accident wakes up in the body of Yamcha in the \"Dragon Ball\" manga.\n\nToriyama also created a short series, \"Neko Majin\" (1999–2005), that became a self-parody of \"Dragon Ball\". In 2006, a crossover between \"Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo\" (or \"Kochikame\") and \"Dragon Ball\" by Toriyama and \"Kochikame\" author Osamu Akimoto appeared in the manga. That same year, Toriyama teamed up with Eiichiro Oda to create a crossover chapter of \"Dragon Ball\" and \"One Piece\" titled \"Cross Epoch\".\n\n\"Dragon Ball\", \"Dragon Ball Z\", and \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\" are all adaptations of the manga, with various new material added in to make extra episodes so that Toriyama would have more time to write original chapters for them to adapt. \"Dragon Ball GT\" and \"Dragon Ball Heroes\" are not originated from any direct source material from Toriyama, being fully created by their respective animation studios. \"Dragon Ball Super\" was released parallel to (and many times ahead of) the manga of the same name, due to the fact that they were both based on the same outline by Toriyama for the story of \"Super\".\n\nToei Animation produced an anime television series based on the first 194 manga chapters, also titled \"Dragon Ball\". The series premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on February 26, 1986 and ran until April 19, 1989, lasting 153 episodes.\n\nInstead of continuing the anime as \"Dragon Ball\", Toei Animation decided to carry on with their adaptation under a new name and asked Akira Toriyama to come up with the title. picks up five years after the first series left off and adapts the final 325 chapters of the manga. It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996. Two television specials based on the \"Z\" series were aired on Fuji TV in Japan. The first, \"The One True Final Battle ~The Z Warrior Who Challenged Freeza -- Son Goku's Father~\", renamed \"\" by Funimation, was shown on October 17, 1990. The second special, \"Defiance in the Face of Despair!! The Remaining Super-Warriors: Gohan and Trunks\", renamed \"\" by Funimation, is based on a special chapter of the original manga and aired on February 24, 1993.\n\n\nIn February 2009, \"Dragon Ball Z\" celebrated its 20th anniversary, with Toei Animation announcing that it would broadcast a re-edited and remastered version under the name . The footage would be re-edited to follow the manga more closely, eliminating scenes and episodes which were not featured in the original manga, resulting in a more faithful adaptation, as well as in a faster-moving, and more focused story. The episodes were remastered for HDTV, with rerecording of the vocal tracks by most of the original cast, and featuring updated opening and ending sequences. On April 5, 2009, the series premiered in Japan airing in Fuji TV. \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\" reduced the episode count to 159 episodes (167 episodes internationally), from the original footage of 291 episodes. Damaged frames were removed, resulting in some minor shots being remade from scratch in order to fix cropping, and others to address continuity issues. The majority of the international versions, including Funimation Entertainment's English dub, are titled \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\".\n\n premiered on Fuji TV on February 7, 1996 and ran until November 19, 1997 for 64 episodes. Unlike the first two anime series, it is not based on Akira Toriyama's original \"Dragon Ball\" manga, being created by Toei Animation as a sequel to the series or as Toriyama called it, a \"grand side story of the original \"Dragon Ball.\"\" Toriyama designed the main cast, the spaceship used in the show, the design of three planets, and came up with the title and logo. In addition to this, Toriyama also oversaw production of the series, just as he had for the \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Dragon Ball Z\" anime. The television special episode, \"Goku's Side Story! The Proof of his Courage is the Four-Star Ball\", or \"\" as Funimation titled it for their dub, aired on March 26, 1997, between episodes 41 and 42, serving as a kind of precursor to the epilogue to the series shown at the end of episode 64.\n\nOn April 28, 2015, Toei Animation announced , the first all-new \"Dragon Ball\" television series to be released in 18 years. It debuted on July 5 and ran as a weekly series at 9:00 am on Fuji TV on Sundays until its series finale on March 25, 2018 after 131 episodes. Masako Nozawa reprises her roles as Goku, Gohan, and Goten. Most of the original cast reprise their roles as well. Kouichi Yamadera and Masakazu Morita also reprise their roles, as Beerus and Whis, respectively.\n\nThe story of the anime is set four years after the defeat of Majin Boo, when the Earth has become peaceful once again. Akira Toriyama is credited as the original creator, as well for \"original story & character design concepts.\" It is also being adapted into a parallel manga.\n\nIn 2018, an anime to promote the \"Dragon Ball Heroes\" card and video game series was announced with a July 1 premiere. The series' announcement included a brief synopsis:Trunks returns from the future to train with Goku and Vegeta. However, he abruptly vanishes. The mysterious man \"Fu\" suddenly appears, telling them that Trunks has been locked up on the \"Prison Planet\", a mysterious facility in an unknown location between universes. The group searches for the Dragon Balls to free Trunks, but an unending super battle awaits them! Will Goku and the others manage to rescue Trunks and escape the Prison Planet?\n\nThe short film \"\" was created for the Jump Super Anime Tour, which celebrated \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" 40th anniversary, and debuted on September 21, 2008. A short animated adaptation of Naho Ōishi's Bardock spinoff manga, \"\", was shown on December 17–18, 2011 at the Jump Festa 2012 event.\n\nA two-episode original video animation (OVA) titled \"\" was created in 1993 as strategy guides for the Famicom video game of the same name. A remake titled \"\" was created as a bonus feature for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game \"\", which was released on November 11, 2010.\n\nA two-part hour-long crossover special between \"Dragon Ball Z\", \"One Piece\" and \"Toriko\", referred to as \"Dream 9 Toriko & One Piece & Dragon Ball Z Super Collaboration Special!!\" aired on April 7, 2013.\n\nNineteen animated theatrical films based on the \"Dragon Ball\" series have been released in Japan. The two most recent films, \"\" (2013) and \"\" (2015), were produced as full-length feature films and were given stand-alone theatrical releases in Japan (as well as limited theatrical releases in the U.S.); these two have a greater sense of continuity with the series than the older films, especially since their storylines were directly adapted into the first-two story arcs of the \"Dragon Ball Super\" anime. They're also the first movies to have original creator Akira Toriyama deeply involved in their production. The 1996 feature film, \"\", with a running time of 80 minutes was produced to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the anime and is a re-imagining of the first arc of the series.\n\nAll films preceding these three were usually below feature length (around 45–60 minutes each), making them only slightly longer than an episode of the TV series, this is due to them being originally shown as back-to-back presentations alongside other Toei film productions. These films are also mostly alternate re-tellings of certain story arcs (like \"The Path to Power\") or extra side-stories that do not correlate with the continuity of the series. The first three films, along with \"The Path to Power\", are based on the original \"Dragon Ball\" anime series. The remaining fifteen films are based on \"Dragon Ball Z\". The first five films were shown at the , while the sixth through seventeenth films were shown at the .\n\nAn American live-action film titled \"Dragonball Evolution\" was produced by 20th Century Fox, after it acquired the feature film rights to the \"Dragon Ball\" franchise in March 2002, previous to the film, two unofficial live-action films have been produced decades prior. The film was directed by James Wong and produced by Stephen Chow, it was released in the United States on April 10, 2009. The film was meant to lead into sequels,\nwhich were cancelled, after the film released and became universally heralded as one of the worst adaptations of all time, being considered by the fans as being unfaithful to the source material. Franchise creator Akira Toriyama also criticized the film adding he was completely left out of the creative process, despite having himself offered to help, going as far as saying: \"the result was a movie, I couldn't even call \"Dragon Ball\"\". Years after its release, the writer of the film, Ben Ramsey, released a public apology in which he admitted to have written the film \"chasing for a payday\" instead of \"as a fan of the franchise\".\n\nWith the news of 20th Century Fox selling itself, it's assets; which include the film rights to the \"Dragonball\" franchise, will now be owned by it's purchaser, Walt Disney Pictures.\n\n\"Dragon Ball Z: The Real 4D\" debuted at Universal Studios Japan in the summer of 2016. It features a battle between Goku and Freeza. Unlike most \"Dragon Ball\" animation, the attraction is animated with CGI. A second attraction titled \"Dragon Ball Z: Super Tenkaichi Budokai\" debuted at Universal Studios Japan in the summer of 2017, which featured a battle between the heroes and Broly.\n\nThe \"Dragon Ball\" franchise has spawned multiple video games across various genres and platforms. Earlier games of the series included a system of card battling and were released for the Famicom following the storyline of the series. Starting with the Super Famicom and Mega Drive, most of the games were from the fighting genre or RPG (Role Playing Game), such as the \"Super Butoden\" series. The first \"Dragon Ball\" game to be released in the United States was \"\" for the PlayStation in 1997. For the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable games the characters were redone in 3D cel-shaded graphics. These games included the \"\" series and the \"\" series. \"\" was the first game of the franchise developed for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. \"Dragon Ball Xenoverse\" was the first game of the franchise developed for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A massively multiplayer online role-playing game called \"Dragon Ball Online\" was available in Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan until the servers were shut down in 2013. A few years later fans started recreating the game. Today, \"Dragon Ball Online Global\" is a new, European version of \"Dragon Ball Online\" and it is being developed, while open beta server is running.\n\nMyriad soundtracks were released in the anime, movies and the games. The music for the first two anime \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Z\" and its films was composed by Shunsuke Kikuchi, while the music from \"GT\" was composed by Akihito Tokunaga and the music from \"Kai\" was composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Norihito Sumitomo. For the first anime, the soundtracks released were \"\" in 1985 and \"\" in 1991, although they were reissued in 2007 and 2003, respectively. For the second anime, the soundtrack series released were \"Dragon Ball Z Hit Song Collection Series\". It was produced and released by Columbia Records of Japan from July 21, 1989 to March 20, 1996 the show's entire lifespan. On September 20, 2006 Columbia re-released the Hit Song Collection on their Animex 1300 series. Other CDs released are compilations, video games and films soundtracks as well as music from the English versions.\n\nThere have been numerous companion books to the \"Dragon Ball\" franchise. Chief among these are the series, comprising seven hardback main volumes and three supplemental softcover volumes, covering the manga and the first two anime series and their theatrical films. The first of these, \"Dragon Ball: The Complete Illustrations\" (\"Daizenshuu\" volume 1), first published in Japan in 1995, is the only one that was released in English, being printed in 2008 by Viz Media. It contains all 264 colored illustrations Akira Toriyama drew for the \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" magazines' covers, bonus giveaways and specials, and all the covers for the 42 \"tankōbon\". It also includes an interview with Toriyama on his work process. The remainder have never been released in English, and all are now out of print in Japan. From February 4 to May 9, 2013, condensed versions of the \"Daizenshuu\" with some updated information were released as the four-volume series. For \"Dragon Ball GT\", the \"Dragon Ball GT Perfect Files\" were released in May and December 1997 by Shueisha's \"Jump Comics Selection\" imprint. They include series information, illustration galleries, behind-the-scenes information, and more. They were out of print for many years, but were re-released in April 2006 (accompanying the Japanese DVD release of \"Dragon Ball GT\") and this edition is still in print.\n\nCoinciding with the 34-volume \"kanzenban\" re-release of the manga, and the release of the entire series on DVD for the first time in Japan, four new guidebooks were released in 2003 and 2004. \"Dragon Ball Landmark\" and \"Dragon Ball Forever\" cover the manga, using volume numbers for story points that reference the \"kanzenban\" release, while and cover the \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Dragon Ball Z\" anime, respectively. Much of the material in these books is reused from the earlier \"Daizenshuu\" volumes, but they include new textual material including substantial interviews with the creator, cast and production staff of the series. \"Son Goku Densetsu\" in particular showcases previously-unpublished design sketches of Goku's father Bardock, drawn by character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru prior to creator Akira Toriyama's revisions that resulted in the final version.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Dragon Ball Kai\" in Japan, four new guidebooks were released: the two-volume in 2009, covering the manga, and two-volume in 2010, covering the anime series. Despite the TV series airing during this time being \"Kai\", the \"Extreme Battle Collection\" books reference the earlier \"Z\" series in content and episode numbers. These books also include new question-and-answer sessions with Akira Toriyama, revealing a few new details about the world and characters of the series. 2010 also saw the release of a new artbook, ; a sort of anime-counterpart to the manga-oriented \"Complete Illustrations\", it showcases anime-original illustrations and includes interviews with the three principal character designers for the anime. Each of the Japanese \"Dragon Box\" DVD releases of the series and movies, which were released from 2003 to 2006, as well as the Blu-ray boxed sets of \"Dragon Ball Kai\", released 2009 to 2011, come with a \"Dragon Book\" guide that contains details about the content therein. Each also contains a new interview with a member of the cast or staff of the series. These books have been reproduced textually for Funimation's release of the \"Dragon Ball Z\" Dragon Box sets from 2009 to 2011.\n\nCollectible cards based on the \"Dragon Ball\", \"Dragon Ball Z\", and \"Dragon Ball GT\" series have been released by Bandai. These cards feature various scenes from the manga and anime stills, plus exclusive artwork from all three series. Bandai released the first set in the United States in July 2008.\n\n\n\"Dragon Ball\" is one of the most popular manga series of all time, and it continues to enjoy high readership today. By 2000, more than 126million copies of its \"tankōbon\" volumes had been sold in Japan alone. It sold over 350million copies worldwide by 2007, and 150million copies in Japan by 2008, making it the best-selling manga ever at the time. By 2012, its sales in Japan had grown to pass 156million, making it the second best-selling \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" manga of all time, behind \"One Piece\". As of February 2014, \"Dragon Ball\" has sold 159.5million copies in Japan.\n\n\"Dragon Ball\" is credited as one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. For the 10th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006, Japanese fans voted \"Dragon Ball\" the third greatest manga of all time. In a survey conducted by Oricon in 2007 among 1,000 people, Son Goku, the main character of the franchise, ranked first place as the \"Strongest Manga Character of All Time.\" Goku's journey and his ever-growing strength resulted in the character winning \"the admiration of young boys everywhere\". Manga artists, such as \"One Piece\" creator Eiichiro Oda and \"Naruto\" creator Masashi Kishimoto, have stated that Goku inspired their series' main protagonists as well as series structure.\n\nManga critic Jason Thompson stated in 2011 that \"\"Dragon Ball\" is by far the most influential shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every \"Shonen Jump\" artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways.\" He says the series \"turns from a gag/adventure manga to an nearly-pure fighting manga\", and its basic formula of \"lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, a few jokes\" became the model for other shōnen series, such as \"Naruto\". Thompson also called Toriyama's art influential and cited it as a reason for the series' popularity. James S. Yadao, author of \"The Rough Guide to Manga\", claims that the first several chapters of \"Dragon Ball \"\"play out much like \"Saiyuki\" with \"Dr. Slump\"-like humour built in\" and that \"Dr. Slump\", Toriyama's previous manga, has a clear early influence on the series. He feels the series \"established its unique identity\" after the first occasion when Goku's group disbands and he trains under Kame-sen'nin, when the story develops \"a far more action-packed, sinister tone\" with \"wilder\" battles with aerial and spiritual elements and an increased death count, while humor still makes an occasional appearance. Yadao claims that an art shift occurs when the characters \"lose the rounded, innocent look that he established in \"Dr. Slump\" and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity.\"\n\n\"Animerica\" felt the series had \"worldwide appeal\", using dramatic pacing and over-the-top martial arts action to \"maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience's attention spans\". In \"Little Boy: The Art of Japan's Exploding Subculture\", Takashi Murakami commented that \"Dragon Ball\" \"never-ending cyclical narrative moves forward plausibly, seamlessly, and with great finesse.\" Ridwan Khan from Animefringe.com commented that the manga had a \"chubby\" art style, but as the series continued the characters got more refined, leaner, and more muscular. Khan prefers the manga over the slow pacing of the anime counterparts. Allen Divers of Anime News Network praised the story and humor of the manga as being very good at conveying all of the characters' personalities. Divers also called Viz's translation one of the best of all the English editions of the series due to its faithfulness to the original Japanese. D. Aviva Rothschild of Rationalmagic.com remarked the first manga volume as \"a superior humor title\". They praised Goku's innocence and Bulma's insistence as one of the funniest parts of the series.\n\nThe content of the manga has been controversial in the United States. In November 1999, Toys \"R\" Us removed Viz's \"Dragon Ball\" from their stores nationwide when a Dallas parent complained the series had \"borderline soft porn\" after he bought them for his four-year-old son. Commenting on the issue, Susan J. Napier explained it as a difference in culture. After the ban, Viz reluctantly began to censor the series to keep wide distribution. However, in 2001, after releasing three volumes censored, Viz announced \"Dragon Ball\" would be uncensored and reprinted due to fan reactions. In October 2009, Wicomico County Public Schools in Maryland banned the \"Dragon Ball\" manga from their school district because it \"depicts nudity, sexual contact between children and sexual innuendo among adults and children.\"\n\nThe anime adaptations have also been very well-received and are better known in the Western world than the manga, with Anime News Network saying, \"Few anime series have mainstreamed it the way \"Dragon Ball Z\" has. To a certain generation of television consumers its characters are as well known as any in the animated realm, and for many it was the first step into the wilderness of anime fandom.\" In 2000, satellite TV channel Animax together with \"Brutus\", a men's lifestyle magazine, and Tsutaya, Japan's largest video rental chain, conducted a poll among 200,000 fans on the top anime series, with \"Dragon Ball\" coming in fourth. TV Asahi conducted two polls in 2005 on the Top 100 Anime, \"Dragon Ball\" came in second in the nationwide survey conducted with multiple age-groups and in third in the online poll. On several occasions, the \"Dragon Ball\" anime has topped Japan's DVD sales. In the United States, the anime series has also sold over 25million DVD units by January 2012, and more than 30million DVD and Blu-ray units as of 2017. The anime films also drew a box office audience of 49million viewers by 2002.\n\nCarl Kimlinger of Anime News Network summed up \"Dragon Ball\" as \"an action-packed tale told with rare humor and something even rarer—a genuine sense of adventure.\" Both Kimlinger and colleague Theron Martin noted Funimation's reputation for drastic alterations of the script, but praised the dub. However, some critics and most fans of the Japanese version have been more critical with Funimation's English dub and script of \"Dragon Ball Z\" over the years. Jeffrey Harris IGN criticized the voices including how Freeza's appearance combined with the feminine English voice left fans confused about Freeza's gender. Carlos Ross of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews considered the series' characters to be different from stereotypical stock characters and noted that they undergo much more development. Despite praising \"Dragon Ball Z\" for its cast of characters, they criticized it for having long and repetitive fights.\n\n\"Dragon Ball Z\" is well-known, and often criticized, for its long, repetitive, dragged-out fights that span several episodes, with Martin commenting \"DBZ practically turned drawing out fights into an art form.\" However, Jason Thompson of io9 explained that this comes from the fact that the anime was being created alongside the manga. \"Dragon Ball Z\" was listed as the 78th best animated show in IGN's Top 100 Animated Series, and was also listed as the 50th greatest cartoon in \"Wizard\" magazine's Top 100 Greatest Cartoons list.\n\nHarris commented that \"Dragon Ball GT\" \"is downright repellent\", mentioning that the material and characters had lost their novelty and fun. He also criticized the \"GT\" character designs of Trunks and Vegeta as being goofy. Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network also gave negative comments about \"GT\", mentioning that the fights from the series were \"a very simple childish exercise\" and that many other anime were superior. The plot of \"Dragon Ball GT\" has also been criticized for giving a formula that was already used in its predecessors.\n\nThe first episode of \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\" earned a viewer ratings percentage of 11.3, ahead of \"One Piece\" and behind \"Crayon Shin-chan\". Although following episodes had lower ratings, \"Kai\" was among the top 10 anime in viewer ratings every week in Japan for most of its run.\n\nIn 2015, the Japan Anniversary Association officially declared May 9 as . In Japanese the numbers five and nine can be pronounced as \"Go\" and \"Ku\".\n\nThe producer of the \"Tekken\" video game series, Katsuhiro Harada, said that \"Dragon Ball\" was one of the first works to visually depict chi and thereby influenced \"Tekken\" and other Japanese games such as \"Street Fighter\". Masaaki Ishikawa, art director of the video game \"Arms\", said that its art style was largely influenced by \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Akira\".\n\nIan Jones-Quartey, a producer of the American animated series \"Steven Universe\", is a fan of \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Dr. Slump\", and uses Toriyama's vehicle designs as a reference for his own. He also stated that \"We're all big Toriyama fans on [\"Steven Universe\"], which kind of shows a bit.\" Additionally, Canadian mixed martial artist Carlos Newton dubbed his fighting style \"Dragonball Jiu-Jitsu\" in tribute to the series.\n\nAn unofficial Roblox spin-off of the series, \"Dragon Ball Bloxy\" and \"Dragon Ball Bloxy: World Tournament,\" was uploaded on Youtube in 2018.\n\nAn unofficial live-action Mandarin Chinese film adaptation of the series, \"\", was released in Taiwan in 1989. In December 1990, the unofficial live-action Korean film \"\" was released.\n\n"}

{"id": "10562587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10562587", "title": "Full breakfast", "text": "Full breakfast\n\nA full breakfast is a breakfast meal that typically includes bacon, sausages, eggs and a beverage such as coffee or tea. It comes in different regional variants and is referred to by different names depending on the area. While it is colloquially known as a “fry up” in most areas of Britain and Ireland, it is usually referred to as a \"full English breakfast\" in England (often shortened to \"full English\"), and therefore, as a \"full Irish\", \"full Scottish\", \"full Welsh\", “full Cornish”, and the \"Ulster fry\" in the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, and Northern Ireland, respectively. It is especially popular in Britain and Ireland to such an extent that many cafes and pubs offer the meal at any time of day as an \"all-day breakfast\". It is also popular in other English-speaking countries, particularly countries that were a part of the British Empire. On its origin, \"Country Life\" magazine states, \"The idea of the English breakfast as a national dish goes right back to the 13th century and the country houses of the gentry. In the old Anglo-Saxon tradition of hospitality, households would provide hearty breakfasts for visiting friends, relatives and neighbours.\"\n\nThe full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised British dishes along with such staples as bangers and mash, shepherd's pie, cottage pie, fish and chips, roast beef, Sunday roast and the Christmas dinner. The fried breakfast became popular in Britain and Ireland during the Victorian era, and appears as one among many suggested breakfasts in home economist Isabella Beeton's \"Book of Household Management\" (1861). A full breakfast is often contrasted (e.g. on hotel menus) with the lighter alternative of a continental breakfast, consisting of tea or coffee, milk and fruit juices with bread, croissants, bagels, or pastries.\n\nThe traditional full English breakfast includes bacon (traditionally back bacon), fried, poached or scrambled eggs, fried or grilled tomatoes, fried mushrooms, fried bread or buttered toast, and sausages (also called \"bangers\"). Black pudding, baked beans and bubble and squeak are also often included. In the North Midlands, fried or grilled oatcakes sometimes replace fried bread. The food is traditionally served with a mug of tea; more recently coffee is an alternative.\n\nAs nearly everything is fried in this meal, it is commonly called a \"fry-up\". As some of the items are optional, the phrase \"full English breakfast\", or \"full English\" (or \"Full Monty\") often specifically denotes a breakfast including everything on offer. The latter name became popular after World War II after British Army general Bernard Montgomery (nicknamed Monty) was said to have started every day with a full English breakfast when in the campaign in North Africa.\n\nThe traditional Cornish breakfast includes hog's pudding and Cornish potato cakes (made with mashed potatoes mixed with flour and butter and then fried), or fried potatoes alongside the usual bacon, sausage, tomato, mushrooms, egg and toast. In the past traditional Cornish breakfasts have included pilchards and herring, or gurty pudding, a Cornish dish similar to haggis, not to be confused with gurty milk, another Cornish breakfast dish made with bread and milk.\n\nIn Ireland, as elsewhere, the exact constituents of a full breakfast vary, depending on geographical area, personal taste and cultural affiliation. Traditionally, the most common ingredients in Ireland are bacon rashers, pork sausages, fried eggs (or scrambled), white pudding, black pudding, toast and fried tomato. Sauteed field mushrooms are also sometimes included, as well as baked beans, hash browns, liver, and brown soda bread. Fried potato farl, boxty or toast is sometimes served as an alternative to brown soda bread. Limerick in particular has a long-standing traditional association with pork-based meat products.\n\nThe \"breakfast roll\", consisting of elements of the full breakfast served in a French roll, has become popular due to the fact it can be easily eaten on the way to school or work, similar to the breakfast burrito in the United States. The breakfast roll is available from many petrol stations and corner shops throughout Ireland.\n\nAn Ulster fry is a dish similar to the Irish breakfast, and is popular throughout Ulster, where it is eaten not only at breakfast time but throughout the day. Typically it will include soda farl and potato bread.\n\nSimilarly to the breakfast roll seen in the south of Ireland, in Northern Ireland they serve \"filled sodas\", which usually consist of a soda farl shallow-fried on one side and filled with fried sausages, bacon or eggs. Fried onions or mushrooms are usually added upon request. Filled sodas are a popular choice for breakfast from roadside fast-food vendors.\n\nIn Scotland, the full breakfast, as with others, contains eggs, back bacon, link sausage, buttered toast, baked beans, and tea or coffee. Distinctively Scottish elements include Scottish style or Stornoway black pudding, Lorne sausage, Ayrshire middle bacon and tattie scones. It commonly also includes fried or grilled tomato or mushrooms and occasionally haggis, white pudding, fruit pudding or oatcakes. As with other breakfasts it has become more common, especially within the home, to grill the meats, puddings and tomatoes and to only fry the eggs and tattie scones. Another more historical Scottish breakfast is porridge.\n\nEarly editions of \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" referred to a \"Scotch breakfast\" as \"a substantial breakfast of sundry sorts of good things to eat and drink\".\n\nAs in the rest of Britain and Ireland, the composition of a Full Welsh Breakfast () can vary. However, with the new-found appreciation of Welsh food and recipes in the early 21st century, there have been attempts to establish a broad definition.\n\nThe traditional Welsh breakfast reflects the coastal aspect of Welsh cuisine. As such it will typically include Welsh cockles and laverbread (a seaweed purée often mixed with oatmeal and fried). Both delicacies are traditionally served with thick bacon, but a Welsh breakfast may also include Welsh sausages, mushrooms and eggs. Full Welsh breakfasts are accompanied by traditional breakfast drinks, with Welsh tea a ubiquitous choice. Today, as they are often served throughout the day in public houses or inns, a traditional beer or ale is not uncommon.\nModern alternatives to the traditional full breakfast will often develop the traditional seafood theme. Smoked fish such as sea trout or sewin may be served accompanied with poached eggs.\n\nThis style of breakfast was brought over to the United States and Canada, where it has endured. A full breakfast in these countries often consists of eggs, various meats, and commonly one type of fried potatoes – hash browns, home fries, Potatoes O'Brien, or potato pancakes – and some form of bread or toast. Most of the time the big breakfast is served for special occasions and on weekends owing to the time needed to prepare them and calories involved.\nIn the Southern US, grits are typically included. \n\nTypical breakfast meats in all of America are bacon, Canadian bacon, breakfast sausage, and ham. In Canada, peameal bacon or cretons are often served. Canada and the USA don't follow the trend of the rest of the Anglosphere where tea is the usual hot beverage for breakfast, but rather both strongly prefer coffee, drunk with milk, cream, or sugar. Maple syrup is common to both, with both nations having sugar shacks in their Eastern forests, Quebec producing the most. Both nations have diners, and there the most common components are eggs, bacon and/or breakfast sausage served with one or two of either toast, English muffins, hash browns, home fries, pancakes, French toast or waffles. Omelettes are a delicacy where anything goes, and several kinds of cheese are added to the mix depending on the desire of the cook, like cheddar, Colby, Monterey Jack, and feta. Eggs Benedict originated in New York and bagels wherever Eastern European Jews settled, but both are now a staple in both countries.\n\nThere is also great regional variety as well. Oatmeal made with rolled oats is common to much of Canada and New England at breakfast, but is replaced by grits in the Southeast, where eating oatmeal for breakfast is a newer convention of the past 50 years as it is traditionally too warm to grow oats there. Biscuits leavened with baking powder or baking soda are a staple of the South and a component of biscuits and gravy. Country ham is very popular in every Southeastern state but Florida and replaces Canadian bacon in recipes. Scrapple and taylor ham are breakfast meats common to Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey and sausages in Texas and Florida are usually a type of chorizo. Country fried steak is a dish that originated in Texas and steak and eggs are popular in much of the Midwest.\n\nThe West is usually the home of dishes like migas, huevos rancheros, and the breakfast burrito, with all three spicy because they contain sizable amounts of chili peppers. Both coasts of Canada and the USA serve smoked salmon for breakfast and it is a staple in particular of First Nations of British Columbia. Eggs Sardou and Eggs Neptune are local variations on Eggs Benedict from Louisiana and Maryland, with each changing out the Canadian bacon with artichoke and crabmeat, respectively. Midwesterners will eat calf brains with their eggs and New Englanders will eat the johnnycake, and Spam is a staple of every Hawaiian plate. Californians invented the fruit smoothie. Juices vary with orange juice being the most popular, but also can be apple, cranberry, or pineapple.\n\nThe full breakfast common in Australia and New Zealand is similar to British/Irish and North American variants, with some differences, having spread to Australasia when it was a part of the British Empire.\n\nBacon, eggs, hash browns, and sausages are the most common aspects of the Australasian full breakfast. Tomato, barbecue and Worcestershire sauces are used frequently, as is cheese. Bread is used as the base for most breakfast dishes, however it is common to use bread (or toast) to make a bacon and egg sandwich. Breakfast muffins are an increasingly popular alternative to bread in the Australasian full breakfast. \n\nRegional variants are prevalent, with German influences particularly commonplace in South Australia.\n\nA few establishments in Hong Kong offer all day breakfast or brunch options (hybrid of English and North American items) from formal restaurants to low frills establishments.\n\nThe ingredients of a full breakfast vary according to region and taste. They are often served with condiments such as brown sauce or ketchup.\n\nSome of the foods that may be included in a full breakfast are:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23668992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23668992", "title": "Geocriticism", "text": "Geocriticism\n\nGeocriticism is a method of literary analysis and literary theory that incorporates the study of geographic space. The term designates a number of different critical practices. In France, Bertrand Westphal has elaborated the concept of \"géocritique\" in several works. In the United States, Robert Tally has argued for a geocriticism as a critical practice suited to the analysis of what he has termed \"literary cartography\".\n\nSome of the first expressly \"geocritical\" writings emerged from symposia organized by Westphal at the University of Limoges. Westphal's foundational essay, \"Pour une approche géocritique des textes\" constitutes a manifesto for geocriticism. Westphal's theory is elaborated in greater detail in his \"Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces\", translated by Tally, who also provides a brief introduction. But there are also many works addressing similar themes and using similar methods that might be considered geocritical, even if the term \"geocriticism\" is not used.\n\nIn Westphal's theory, geocriticism is based on three theoretical concepts: spatio-temporality, transgressivity, and referentiality. \n\nThe idea that space and time form a continuum (space-time) is a tenet of modern physics. In the field of literary theory, geocriticism is an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses not only on such temporal data as relations between the life and times of the author (as in biographical criticism), the history of the text (as in textual criticism), or the story (as studied by narratology), but also on spatial data. Geocriticism therefore has affinities with geography, architecture, urban studies, and so on; it also correlates to philosophical concepts such as deterritorialization.\nFollowing the work of Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Henri Lefebvre and Mikhail Bakhtin, among others, a geocritical approach to literature recognizes that representations of space are often transgressive, crossing the boundaries of established norms while also reestablishing new relations among people, places, and things. Cartography is no longer seen as the exclusive province of the state or the government; rather, various agents or groups may be responsible for representing the geographic spaces at the same time and with different effects. In practice, therefore, geocriticism is multifocal, examining a variety of topics at once, thus differentiating itself from practices that focus on the singular point of view of the traveler or protagonist. \n\nGeocriticism also assumes a literary referentiality between world and text, or, in other words, between the referent and its representation. By questioning the relations between a given space's nature and its actually existing condition, the geocritical approach allows for a study of fiction that points also to the theory of possible worlds, such as may be seen in the work on third space by the American geographer Edward Soja (\"Thirdspace\"). Tally's book \"Spatiality\", an introduction to spatiality studies in literature and critical theory, includes a chapter on geocriticism.\n\nGeocriticism frequently involves the study of places described in the literature by various authors, but it can also study the effects of literary representations of a given space. An example of the range of geocritical practices can be found in Tally's collection \"Geocritical Explorations: Space, Place, and Mapping in Literary and Cultural Studies\".\n\nGeocriticism derives some of its practices from precursors whose theoretical work helped establish space as a valid topic for literary analysis. For example, in \"The Poetics of Space\" and elsewhere, Gaston Bachelard studied literary works to develop a typology of places according to their connotations. Maurice Blanchot's writings have legitimized the idea of literary space, an imaginary place for the creation of the work of literature. One might also look at the developments of cultural studies and especially postcolonial studies, such as Raymond Williams's \"The Country and the City\" or Edward Said's \"Culture and Imperialism\", which employ what Said has called a \"geographical inquiry into historical experience.\" Fredric Jameson's concept of cognitive mapping and his theoretical engagement with the postmodern condition also highlight the importance of spatial representation and aesthetic productions, including literature, film, architecture, and design. In \"The Atlas of European Novel, 1800-1900\", Franco Moretti has examined the diffusion of literary spaces in Europe, focusing on the complex relationship between the text and space. Moretti has also promulgated a theory of literary history, or literary geography, that would use maps to bring to light new connections between the texts studied and their social spaces. And, in his study of Herman Melville's literary cartography, Robert Tally has offered a geocritical approach to certain texts. \n\nGeocriticism has intellectual and methodological affiliations with such fields as Literature and the Environment or ecocriticism, regional literature, urban studies, sociological and philosophical approaches to literature, and utopian studies.\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n"}

They are very active in Russia, Georgia, and in NV Copenhagen\n\nGeorgian mafia is known as best organized and most ruthless criminal group, being very \"structured\" and \"hierarchical\". At the head of such a group is a leader who rarely appears in public and, in turn, reports to a \"Godfather\", who operates on an international level. The power of the leader is largely dependent on his ability to subordinate independent groups of thieves under his authority. His underlings oversee the activities of smaller Georgian criminal gangs. The pyramid is cemented by the payment of tributes to the leader of each group acting in the region. This is the so-called \"common fund\".\n\nIt has two major criminal clans:\n\nGeorgia always had a disproportionately high number of crime bosses and still has a majority of the 700 or so still operating in the post-Soviet space and western Georgia (Kutaisi clan) is particularly well represented.\n\nIn some of its rules or \"laws\", the Georgian mafia parallels the Sicilian Mafia. There are differences but many things are similar.\n\nThe Russian criminal subculture of the thieves-in-law (, \"kanonieri kurdi\") disproportionately included ethnic Georgians. During the 1970s Brezhnev stagnation, corrupt officials increasingly turned to the criminal underworld to source black market supplies. However, the Thieves Code explicitly forbade cooperation of any kind with the authorities, and at a 1982 summit of thieves in Tbilisi, the secret society was split in two, with Georgian thieves favouring closer collaboration with officials while this motion was opposed by Slavic 'purists'.\n\nGeorgia quickly gained a reputation as one of the most corrupt but also relatively prosperous. Georgian farmers ignored the planned economy and grew much-prized citrus fruits and were protected by Georgian officials, who also ran networks of underground factories and distribution chains.\n\nDuring the period leading up to Georgian independence in 1991, as tension grew between Georgians and ethnic Abkhaz several nationalist militias were formed, the two most prominent being the National Guard of Georgia led by ex-convict Tengiz Kitovani and the Mkhedrioni led by former thief-in-law Jaba Ioseliani. Due to an absence of any other means of funding, the militias engaged in protection rackets and smuggling and the weak Georgian government had no choice but to embrace them.\n\nThe paramilitaries were first deployed against the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, but attempts by President Zviad Gamsakhurdia to rein them in resulted in a violent coup where he was replaced by Eduard Shevardnadze, who had the backing of the militias, which continued to operate with impunity. The Mkhedrioni took advantage of their position of power to take over the gasoline business. Shevardnadze finally got the excuse he needed to disband the militias in 1995 after an assassination attempt. Ioseliani was imprisoned, although released in 2000 as part of a general amnesty, dying three years later. But other, less idealistic thieves-in-law still continued to dominate day-to-day life in Georgia.\n\nIn November 2003 a popular uprising known as the Rose Revolution toppled the Shevardnadze regime and put Mikheil Saakashvili in power. Saakashvili soon implemented a series of reforms aimed at tackling crime and corruption, firing and imprisoning a number of officials as well as making membership of the thieves-in-law a crime in 2005. In response to this as well as harsher prison regimes, several prison riots broke out before being heavy-handedly put down. In order to avoid prosecution, Georgian gangsters fled the country, typically to Russia, Israel and Western Europe.\n\nGeorgian organized crime has been present in Russia since the Soviet era. During the 1990s, as rival criminal gangs, corrupt law enforcement and oligarchs fought one another for supremacy over the lucrative protection rackets of the emerging private business sector in the chaotic transition to capitalism, the Georgian mafia made its presence known in Moscow. One of the most famous bosses of this period was Otari Kvantrishvili, a former sportsman turned racketeer after a conviction for rape. He would often act as a go-between for various underworld factions and something of a public face for the mafia. Prior to his assassination in 1993, Kvantrishvili spoke of his ambitions to start his own political party. His funeral was attended by many celebrities and politicians, including the singer Joseph Kobzon.\n\nIn more recent years, the Georgian underworld in Russia, Georgia and elsewhere has been characterised by a violent feud between the Kutaisi and Tbilisi clans, led by Tariel Oniani and Aslan Usoyan, respectively. The conflict claimed the life of notorious Russian thief-in-law Vyacheslav Ivankov, who was assassinated while attempting to mediate in 2009, while Usoyan was himself killed by a sniper in January 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

This hieroglyphic spelling includes the symbol for the word \"ka\" (\"kꜣ\"), the ancient Egyptian concept of the vital force.\n\nThe Old Kingdom Pyramid Texts depict \"ḥk3w\" as a supernatural energy that the gods possess. The \"cannibal pharaoh\" must devour other gods to gain this magical power. Eventually, Heka was elevated to a deity in his own right and a cult devoted to him developed. By the Coffin Texts, Heka is said to be created at the beginning of time by the creator Atum. Later Heka is depicted as part of the tableau of the divine solar barge as a protector of Osiris capable of blinding crocodiles. Then, during the Ptolemaic dynasty, Heka's role was to proclaim the pharaoh's enthronement as a son of Isis, holding him in his arms.\n\nHeka also appears as part of a divine triad in Esna, capital of the Third Nome, where he is the son of ram-headed Khnum and a succession of goddesses.

It was already rapidly declining by the seventh century because the invaders quickly adopted the Latin vernacular spoken by the local Gallo-Roman population. Lombardic may have been in scattered use until as late as c. AD 1000. A number of Italian place names and items of Italian vocabulary derive from Lombardic. Some linguists have argued that the modern Cimbrian and Mocheno varieties in Northeast Italy, usually classified as Austro-Bavarian, are in fact surviving Lombard remnants. This could, in turn, indicate that Lombardic was itself an Austro-Bavarian dialect.\n\nLombardic is preserved only fragmentarily, the main evidence being individual words used in Latin texts. For example, the Edict of Rothari of 643, the earliest Lombard legal code, is written in Latin, with only individual legal terms given in Lombardic. The many Lombard personal names preserved in Latin deeds from the Kingdom of the Lombards also provide evidence of the language.\n\nIn the absence of Lombardic texts, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about its morphology and syntax. The genetic classification is necessarily based entirely on phonology. Because there is evidence that Lombardic participated in, and indeed shows some of the earliest evidence for, the High German consonant shift, it is classified as an Elbe Germanic or Upper German dialect. The Historia Langobardorum of Paulus Diaconus mentions a duke Zaban of 574, showing shifted to . The term \"stolesazo\" (ablative) (the second element is cognate with English \"seat\") in the Edictum Rothari shows the same shift. Many names in the Lombard royal families show shifted consonants, particularly < in the following name components:\n\nThis sound change left two different sets of names in the Italian language: palco (longobard palk, \"beam\")/balcone (longobard balk, \"wood platform\"); panca (longobard panka)/banca (longobard banka, \"bench\").\n\nFormerly, Lombardic was classified as Ingaevonian (North Sea Germanic) or as Eastern Germanic, but these classifications are considered obsolete. The classification of Lombardic within the Germanic languages may be complicated by issues of orthography. According to Hutterer (1999) it is close to Old Saxon. Tacitus counts them among the Suebi. Paulus Diaconus (8th century) and the \"Codex Gothanus\" (9th century) wrote that the Lombards were ultimately of Scandinavian origin, having settled at the Elbe before entering Italy.\n\nLombardic fragments are preserved in runic inscriptions, in Latinized forms, and in transcriptions influenced by Old High German orthography. This \"Lombardic alphabet\", as commonly transcribed, consists of the following graphemes:\n\nThe \"qu\" represents a sound. The \"ʒ\" is , e.g. \"skauʒ\" \"womb\".\nThe \"z\" is . \"h\" is word-initially, and elsewhere.\n\nAmong the primary source texts are short inscriptions in the Elder Futhark, among them the \"bronze capsule of Schretzheim\" (c. 600):\n\nAnd also the two fibulae of Bezenye, Hungary (mid 6th century):\n\nThere are a number of Latin texts that include Lombardic names, and Lombardic legal texts contain terms taken from the legal vocabulary of the vernacular, including:\n\nIn 2006, Emilia Denčeva argued that the inscription of the Pernik sword may be Lombardic.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3771276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3771276", "title": "My Bloody Valentine (film)", "text": "My Bloody Valentine (film)\n\nMy Bloody Valentine is a 1981 Canadian slasher film directed by George Mihalka and written by John Beaird, starring Paul Kelman, Lori Hallier, and Neil Affleck. The film tells the story of a group of young adults who decide to throw a Valentine's Day party only to incur the vengeful wrath of an assailant in mining gear who begins a killing spree.\n\nConceived and produced entirely over the course of around a year, the film was shot on location in Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia, Canada, in the fall of 1980. It was released theatrically in North America beginning in February 1981, coinciding with the Valentine's holiday.\n\n\"My Bloody Valentine\" faced notable censorship, having a total of nine minutes cut by the Motion Picture Association of America due to the amount of violence and gore. Though co-producer Dunning confirmed that the excised footage still existed, attempts to release it proved difficult as Paramount Pictures refused to offer an uncut version. In 2009, Lionsgate subsequently acquired DVD rights to the film and released a DVD with three minutes of additional footage restored. The same year, Lionsgate released a remake of the film.\n\nInside a mine shaft, a female miner takes off her gear in front of another miner. When the woman performs a striptease, the miner pushes her onto a mining pickaxe, killing her.\n\nMayor Hanniger of mining town Valentine Bluffs reinstates the traditional Valentine's Day dance, which has been suspended for twenty years. The dances stopped after an accident in which two supervisors left several miners in the mines to attend the dance. Because they forgot to check methane gas levels, there was an explosion that trapped the miners. Harry Warden, the only survivor, resorted to cannibalism to survive and became insane. He murdered the two supervisors who left them there, and vowed further attacks if the Valentine's Day Dance ever occurred again. Warden was placed into an asylum and the accident was forgotten, so the dance resumed. A group of young residents are excited about the dance: Gretchen, Dave, Hollis, Patty, Sylvia, Howard, Mike, John, Tommy, and Harriet. Sarah, Axel, and the mayor's son T.J. are involved in a tense love triangle.\n\nMayor Hanniger and the town's police chief Jake Newby receive an anonymous box of Valentine chocolates containing a human heart, and a note warning that murders will begin if the dance proceeds. That evening, resident Mabel is murdered by a mining-geared killer, and her heart removed. Newby publicly reports that she died of a heart attack to prevent a panic. He contacts the mental institution where Harry Warden was incarcerated, but they have no record of him. Hanniger and Newby cancel the dance but the town's youngsters decide to hold their own party at the mine. A bartender warns them against it but is killed by the miner.\n\nAt the party, the miner brutally kills Dave and Sylvia. Newby rushes into the mines with police to rescue the remaining teenagers. The miner impales a large drill into Mike and Harriet, and shoots a nail gun into Hollis's head. Horrified, Howard flees. The remaining four try to climb to the top with a ladder, but discover a dead beheaded Howard. \n\nWhile finding their way out, Axel and Patty are killed by the miner. The miner chases T.J. and Sarah and a fight ensues. The miner is revealed to be Axel, who faked his demise. A flashback shows that Axel's father was one of the supervisors. As a child, Axel witnessed Harry Warden murdering his father, which traumatized him. The tunnel begins to collapse from the fight, and traps Axel while Newby and the police arrive to rescue T.J. and Sarah. It is revealed that Harry Warden had died five years earlier. T.J. and Sarah hear a rescuer shout that Axel is alive and rush back to the scene. Sarah sees an insane Axel freeing himself from the debris by amputating his trapped arm. He runs deeper into the mine shouting threats to murder everyone in town, and mumbling about Sarah being his “bloody valentine.” The film ends with a maniacal laugh being heard.\n\nDirector George Mihalka, on the strength of his earlier movie \"Pick-Up Summer\", was approached by Cinepix Productions, headed by André Link and John Dunning with a two-movie contract. Mihalka was asked to direct a horror-slasher story, presented to Dunning by Stephen Miller in mid-1980, and, after Mihalka agreed to direct, John Beaird was bought in to write the screenplay. \n\nThe film was originally entitled \"The Secret\"; however, the producers decided to change it to \"My Bloody Valentine\", so to overtly reference the holiday serial killer trend with which the slasher genre was becoming increasingly popular, through films such as \"Black Christmas\" (1974), \"Halloween\" (1978) and \"Friday the 13th\" (1980). At the time, the slasher sub-genre had seen further commercial success with the releases of \"Prom Night\" and \"Terror Train\" (both 1980).\n\nShooting on \"My Bloody Valentine\" began in September 1980, taking place around the Princess Colliery Mine in Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia, which had closed in 1975. Filming completed in November 1980. The budget was approximately $2.3 million. Two mines were considered for the setting, the other in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. The production company decided on the Sydney Mines location due to \"the exterior [being] a dreary, cold and dusty area [with] no other buildings around it so it looked like it was totally in the middle of nowhere.\"\n\nUpon arrival at the town for principal photography, the crew found that the townspeople, unbeknownst to them, had redecorated the mine so to make it more presentable, thus destroying the dark atmosphere that had convinced the production company to base the film there. The cast therefore spent a few days staying in Sydney Mines, encouraged by the director to get a feel for the small-town location.\n\nMihalka has said since making the movie that the most difficult element of \"My Bloody Valentine\" was filming in the mines. Located underground, filming in the mine was a lengthy process, as, due to limited space in the elevators, it would take an hour to assemble the cast and crew underground. Also, due to the methane levels, lighting had to be carefully planned as the number of bulbs that could be safely utilised was limited. Prior to the production's arrival to the mine, the owners cleaned up the location significantly, leaving it described as a \"clean and colourful Disneyland-like set.\" This resulted in the production team spending an estimated $30,000 to paint portions of the mine to achieve a darker atmosphere, akin to how it had appeared in its original state. Producer Dunning referred to the shoot as \"horrendous.\" \n\n\"My Bloody Valentine\" grossed US$5,672,031 at the United States box office upon its February 11, 1981 release. Though the U.S. gross exceeded the film's $2.3 million budget, it was considered a box-office disappointment by Paramount Pictures, returning a \"derisory sum of $2.6 million.\" This profit amounted to less than one-third of Paramount's \"Friday the 13th\", released the year before.\n\nUpon its release, \"My Bloody Valentine\" received numerous reviews criticizing it for its depiction of violence and gore. Bruce Bailey of the \"Montreal Gazette\" noted the film as having an \"awkward script,\" adding: \"All that's really notable about \"My Bloody Valentine\" is that it gives you more than the usual m.p.g.p.murders per gallon of popcorn.\" Tom Buckley of \"The New York Times\" echoed a similar sentiment, writing: \"\"My Bloody Valentine\" probably won't make you shiver with fright, but it's almost certain to make you squirm, first with irritation and then with revulsion.\" The \"Detroit Free Press\"s Jack Mathews conversely complimented the film on delivering \"on its title promise by bucketfuls,\" adding: \"There's nothing subtle about \"My Bloody Valentine\". A pickax to the belly, a 10-penny nail through the forehead, a granite drill through the back. There are some passing attempts at comic relief, but most of the yuks are inadvertent.\" Ernest Leogrande of the \"New York Daily News\" noted the film as bearing similarity to other slasher films of the time, but conceded: \"Movies like this are designed to make you jump, scream, hide your eyes, hug your date and talk with glee about what bad taste the movie makers are capable of. \"My Bloody Valentine\" does all that.\"\n\nSeveral reviewers were highly critical of the film's partial financing by the Canadian Film Development Corporation, which used taxed income from Canadian provinces to help fund its production: Among them were John Dodd of the \"Edmonton Journal\", who lambasted the film as a \"rip off\" of \"Halloween\" (1978), adding: \"All this perverted gore is brought to you thanks to the financial help of the Canadian Film Development Corp. which uses your own tax money to help greedy, talentless producers make a killing, you should pardon the expression.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" also noted the corporation's financing in his review, in which he awarded the film one out of four stars, deeming it a \"dismal and depressing horror film,\" and \"another entry in that most depressing of film genres, the mad-slasher-with-a-knife.\"\n\nEd Blank of the \"Pittsburgh Press\" faulted the film's cinematography and mine setting, writing that its \"novelty, for the worse as it happens, is that the principal setting is a coal mine where most of the male characters work. Shooting scenes in the mine, brightened only by the miners' hats, permits Mihalka to play without a full deck. You can't tell what's going on.\" Dan Scapperotti of \"Cinefantastique\", alternately praised the film's cinematography, writing: \"[it] is beautifully photographed, and the utilization of the mine creates powerful imagery.\"\n\nWriting for \"The Atlanta Constitution\", Richard Zoglin noted that the film \"floats along effortlessly in the current flood of schlock-horror films unleashed by John Carpenter's \"Halloween\". But it is more restrained — even tasteful — than most. The camera averts its eyes from much of the blood and gore, and women are treated somewhat better than usual (that is, they are generally allowed to keep their clothes on before being dispatched).\" While praising the film for constraining the amount of violence shown, Zoglin criticized the characters and the plot for being \"uninteresting\" and \"predictable.\" Linda Gross of the \"Los Angeles Times\" panned the film for being \"too convoluted, too derivative and, oddly, too ambitious to properly coagulate into the kind of exploitation movie that it tries to be.\" However, she conceded that the film's cinematography is \"sharp\" and the musical score \"portentous.\"\n\nContemporary review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes shows the film has a 47% approval rating, with an average rating of 4.8/10.\n\nIn a March 30, 2007 issue of \"Entertainment Weekly\", the film was ranked 17 in a list of guilty pleasures, listed among such films as \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"Escape from New York\", and called \"the most criminally underappreciated of the slasher genre.\" Popular filmmaker Quentin Tarantino called it his all-time favorite slasher film. In a retrospective assessment, film historian Adam Rockoff wrote that the film was \"easily one of the best and most polished slasher films.\"\n\nIn another retrospective assessment by scholar Jim Harper in his book \"Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies\", he notes that the film distinguishes itself from other slashers by moving outside the \"typical teen based scenario,\" instead focusing on a group of twenty-something adults in a working class community, and relying on a notable \"atmosphere dread.\"\n\n\"My Bloody Valentine\" was significantly censored in North America upon its theatrical release. For the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) to award the movie with an R-rating, cuts were requested to every death sequence in the film; producer Dunning said the film was essentially \"cut to ribbons\" in order to achieve an R-rating. Even after cutting the film to match the requirements made by the MPAA, it was again returned with an X-rating and further cuts were demanded. Stills of the trimmed footage were published in \"Fangoria\" magazine whilst the film was still in production, though the sequences were excised from the theatrical version; even today the complete uncut version has not been released (though a 2009 DVD and Blu-ray release by Lionsgate reinstated three minutes of excised footage). The standard North American theatrical cut of the film ran approximately 90 minutes. In the United Kingdom, the film was passed for theatrical release by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) on March 30, 1981; according to the BBFC catalogue, this version ran at 90 minutes and 55 seconds.\n\nThere are two reasons that are frequently attributed to the extreme cutting of the film. It has been suggested that Paramount Pictures was keen to remove the offending footage due to the backlash they had received from releasing \"Friday the 13th\" the previous year. The second reason, that Mihalka attributes, is that the movie was cut due to the murder of John Lennon in December 1980, stating that there was a major backlash against movie violence in the wake of his death.\n\nAn uncensored cut of \"My Bloody Valentine\" remained unavailable to the public for nearly thirty years after its original theatrical release. When Paramount released the film on DVD in North America for the first time in 2002, the studio claimed that the purported \"missing\" footage did not exist. \n\nIn 2008, Lionsgate acquired the rights to the film after producing a feature film remake, and in the process, acquired excised footage never-before seen in the standard theatrical cut of the film. In January 2009, Lionsgate and Paramount co-released an unrated Region 1 \"Special Edition\" DVD featuring this footage. This DVD allows viewers the option to watch the standard R-rated version of the film, as well as an uncensored version in which excised violent footage is reinstated. Despite this, three scenes play in their unrated form regardless of which version is being viewed: the flashbacks of Axel's father's death, and Harry Warden with the arm. Commenting on the release, director Mihalka said: \"[with this DVD] we have it back to 80% of the image back and 95% of the impact back.\"\n\nThe 2009 \"Special Edition\" DVD reinstates approximately two-and-a-half minutes of previously-unreleased footage back into the film, which contradicts an earlier claim by director Mihalka that it had been trimmed by 8–9 minutes. It has been argued that the so-called uncut DVD still has some sequences missing, particularly the double-impalement of Mike and Harriet which the director recalls filming. It is thought that the remaining footage appears to be composed of expository scenes, such as dialogue and other non-violence related material. This is given credence by the fact that Mihalka gave his seal of approval to this release, and a written introduction by him precedes the beginning of the special edition DVD, stating that this version was the way that the film was meant to be seen.\n\n\"My Bloody Valentine\" was released to both videotape and LaserDisc in the 1980s. \n\nThe film made its DVD debut on September 3, 2002 from Paramount Home Video; this was a standard widescreen release of the theatrical cut, and it contained no bonus materials. The same disc was re-issued as a DVD double feature with \"April Fool's Day\" (1986; also a Paramount title) in March 2008.\n\nOn January 13, 2009, a \"Special Edition\" DVD version of the film was released in North America, coinciding with the theatrical release of the remake. This version integrates the cut footage back into the film and features two featurettes and optional introductory sequences to the previously missing murder sequences. Two featurettes are also included. Director Mihalka, cast members Lori Hallier, Neil Affleck, Helene Udy, and Carl Marotte, composer Paul Zaza and make-up artists Thomas Burman and Ken Diaz are all involved.\n\nA Blu-ray was released on November 24, 2009 from Lionsgate, on loan from Paramount. The disc contained the same bonus materials as the \"Special Edition\" DVD released in January 2009. The Blu-ray is now out of print.\n\nOn January 16, 2009, shortly after the uncut version of the film was released in Canada, a remake titled \"My Bloody Valentine 3D\" was released in theaters.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1545981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1545981", "title": "National Curriculum for England", "text": "National Curriculum for England\n\nThe National Curriculum for England was first introduced by the Education Reform Act of 1988. At the time of its introduction the legislation applied to both England and Wales. However, education later became a devolved matter for the Welsh government. The current statutory National Curriculum dates from 2014 at which point it was introduced to most year groups across primary and secondary education. Some elements were introduced in September 2015. The National Curriculum sets out the content matter which must be taught in a number of subjects in \"local authority–maintained schools\".\n\nThere are two main aims presented in the statutory documentation for the National Curriculum, stating:\n\nThese aims set out to support the statutory duties of schools to offer a curriculum which is balanced and broadly based and which promotes the spiritual, moral, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society, while preparing pupils at the school for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life, as set out in the Education Act 2002.\n\nThe National Curriculum, as released most recently in 2014, is set out for all year groups for pupils aged between 5 and 16. Within these ages, the curriculum is structured into four Key Stages, for each of which a prescribed list of subjects must be taught. The table below sets out the statutory list of subjects to be taught at each Key Stage:\n\nFor each of the statutory curriculum subjects, the Secretary of State for Education is required to set out a Programme of Study which outlines the content and matters which must be taught in those subjects at the relevant Key Stages. The most recently-published National Curriculum was introduced into schools in September 2014.\n\nIn addition, children in all Key Stages must be provided with a curriculum of Religious Education, and for pupils in Key Stages 3 and 4 a curriculum of Sex and Relationships Education must also be provided.\nAt Key Stage 4, although some subjects are not compulsory for all students, provision must be made to allow all students to access the arts (comprising art and design, music, dance, drama and media arts), design and technology, the humanities (comprising geography and history) and a modern foreign language.\n\nIn a 1976 speech at Ruskin College, Prime Minister James Callaghan launched what became known as the \"Great Debate\". The speech has been called \"revolutionary\" in the context of its time, and that it \"lit a flare that has illuminated education reform ever since\". The speech intended to stimulate wide debate on the purpose of education in the UK:\nThese are proper subjects for discussion and debate. And it should be a rational debate based on the facts... It is not my intention to become enmeshed in such problems as whether there should be a basic curriculum with universal standards - although I am inclined to think there should be... The goals of our education, from nursery school through to adult education, are clear enough. They are to equip children to the best of their ability for a lively, constructive, place in society, and also to fit them to do a job of work. Not one or the other but both... Both of the basic purposes of education require the same essential tools. These are basic literacy, basic numaracy, the understanding of how to live and work together, respect for others, respect for the individual. This means requiring certain basic knowledge, and skills and reasoning ability. It means developing lively inquiring minds and an appetite for further knowledge that will last a lifetime. It means mitigating as far as possible the disadvantages that may be suffered through poor home conditions or physical or mental handicap. Are we aiming in the right direction in these matters?\n\nThe first statutory National Curriculum was introduced by the Education Reform Act 1988 by Kenneth Baker. The Programmes of Study were drafted and published in 1988 and 1989, with the first teaching of some elements of the new curriculum beginning in September 1989.\n\nUnder Gillian Shephard's tenure as Education Secretary, a review of the National Curriculum was launched in 1994, led by Ron Dearing. Its objective was to find ways to 'slim down' the over-detailed curriculum. The final report set out the need to reduce the volume of statutory content, particularly at lower key stages, as well as recommending changes to methods of assessment. Consequently, an updated National Curriculum was published in 1995 which saw a considerable reduction in the content of the curriculum and a simplification in line with Dearing's recommendations.\n\nWhen a new Labour government took office in 1997, its focus on English and Maths led to a decision to disapply the statutory Programmes of Study for the foundation subjects from September 1998, to allow schools to spend more time teaching literacy and numeracy. The Secretary of State, David Blunkett later announced another overhaul of the National Curriculum, particularly at primary level, to reduce the content in foundation subjects allowing more time to be spent on the core subjects of English, Maths and Science. A new National Curriculum was published in 1999, for first teaching in September 2000.\n\nFurther changes were announced by Ed Balls in 2007 for the statutory curriculum for Key Stages 3 and 4, which again focussed on removing some content from the documentation, while also adding some additional element, with the intended aim of additional flexibility for schools. These changes were introduced in September 2008, and were swiftly followed by proposed changes to the primary curriculum, based on a review to be led by Jim Rose. The review proposed replacing the 10 statutory subjects in Key Stages 1 and 2 with 6 broader 'areas of learning', such as \"understanding English, communication and languages\" and \"human, social and environmental understanding\". However, following the change of government in 2010, the plans for this change - proposed to begin in September 2011 - were abandoned, with schools advised to continue to follow the 2000 curriculum pending review. \n\nFollowing his appointment as Education Secretary in 2010, Michael Gove commissioned an expert review panel to report on a framework for a new National Curriculum. The review was led by Tim Oates of Cambridge Assessment, and reported in December 2011. It suggested significant changes to the structure of the National Curriculum, including dividing Key Stage 2 into two shorter (two-year) phases.\nIn 2013, the government produced a draft National Curriculum, followed by a final version in September 2013, for first teaching in September 2014. Due to the short timescales for introduction, the curriculum was introduced only for certain subjects and year groups in 2014, with the core subjects in Years 2 and 6 (the final years of Key Stages 1 and 2) only becoming statutory in September 2015, to allow time for the introduction of new testing arrangements at the end of the Key Stages. Similarly, core subjects at Key Stage 4 are to be introduced on a year-by-year basis starting in September 2015 for English and Maths, and September 2016 for Science.\n\n"}

{"id": "2871407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2871407", "title": "Positivism", "text": "Positivism\n\nPositivism is a philosophical theory stating that certain (\"positive\") knowledge is based on natural phenomena and their properties and relations. Thus, information derived from sensory experience, interpreted through reason and logic, forms the exclusive source of all certain knowledge. Positivism holds that valid knowledge (certitude or truth) is found only in this \"a posteriori\" knowledge.\n\nVerified data (positive facts) received from the senses are known as empirical evidence; thus positivism is based on empiricism.\n\nPositivism also holds that society, like the physical world, operates according to general laws. Introspective and intuitive knowledge is rejected, as are metaphysics and theology because metaphysical and theological claims cannot be verified by sense experience. Although the positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of western thought, the modern sense of the approach was formulated by the philosopher Auguste Comte in the early 19th century. Comte argued that, much as the physical world operates according to gravity and other absolute laws, so does society, and further developed positivism into a \"Religion of Humanity\".\n\nThe English noun \"positivism\" was re-imported in the 19th century from the French word \"positivisme\", derived from \"positif\" in its philosophical sense of 'imposed on the mind by experience'. The corresponding adjective (lat. \"positīvus\") has been used in a similar sense to discuss law (positive law compared to natural law) since the time of Chaucer.\"\n\nPositivism is part of a more general ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry, notably laid out by Plato and later reformulated as a quarrel between the sciences and the humanities, Plato elaborates a critique of poetry from the point of view of philosophy in his dialogues \"Phaedrus\" 245a, \"Symposium\" 209a, \"Republic\" 398a, \"Laws\" 817 b-d and \"Ion\". Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911) popularized the distinction between Geisteswissenschaft (humanities) and Naturwissenschaften (natural sciences).\n\nThe consideration that laws in physics may not be absolute but relative, and, if so, this might be more true of social sciences, was stated, in different terms, by G. B. Vico in 1725. Vico, in contrast to the positivist movement, asserted the superiority of the science of the human mind (the humanities, in other words), on the grounds that natural sciences tell us nothing about the inward aspects of things.\n\nPositivism asserts that all authentic knowledge allows verification and that all authentic knowledge assumes that the only valid knowledge is scientific. Thinkers such as Henri de Saint-Simon (1760–1825), Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827) and Auguste Comte (1798–1857) believed the scientific method, the circular dependence of theory and observation, must replace metaphysics in the history of thought. Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) reformulated sociological positivism as a foundation of social research.\n\nWilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911), in contrast, fought strenuously against the assumption that only explanations derived from science are valid. He reprised the argument, already found in Vico, that scientific explanations do not reach the inner nature of phenomena and it is humanistic knowledge that gives us insight into thoughts, feelings and desires. Dilthey was in part influenced by the historicism of Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886).\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century the first wave of German sociologists, including Max Weber and Georg Simmel, rejected the doctrine, thus founding the antipositivist tradition in sociology. Later antipositivists and critical theorists have associated positivism with \"scientism\"; science \"as ideology\". Later in his career (1969), German theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg, Nobel laureate for pioneering work in quantum mechanics, distanced himself from positivism by saying: The positivists have a simple solution: the world must be divided into that which we can say clearly and the rest, which we had better pass over in silence. But can any one conceive of a more pointless philosophy, seeing that what we can say clearly amounts to next to nothing? If we omitted all that is unclear we would probably be left with completely uninteresting and trivial tautologies.\n\nIn the early 20th century, logical positivism—a descendant of Comte's basic thesis but an independent movement—sprang up in Vienna and grew to become one of the dominant schools in Anglo-American philosophy and the analytic tradition. Logical positivists (or 'neopositivists') rejected metaphysical speculation and attempted to reduce statements and propositions to pure logic. Strong critiques of this approach by philosophers such as Karl Popper, Willard Van Orman Quine and Thomas Kuhn have been highly influential, and led to the development of postpositivism.\n\nIn historiography the debate on positivism has been characterized by the quarrel between positivism and historicism. (Historicism is also sometimes termed \"historism\" in the German tradition.)\n\nArguments against positivist approaches in historiography include that history differs from sciences like physics and ethology in subject matter and method. That much of what history studies is nonquantifiable, and therefore to quantify is to lose in precision. Experimental methods and mathematical models do not generally apply to history, and it is not possible to formulate general (quasi-absolute) laws in history.\n\nPositivism in the social sciences is usually characterized by quantitative approaches and the proposition of quasi-absolute laws. A significant exception to this trend is represented by cultural anthropology, which tends naturally toward qualitative approaches.\n\nIn psychology the positivist movement was influential in the development of operationalism. The 1927 philosophy of science book \"The Logic of Modern Physics\" in particular, which was originally intended for physicists, coined the term operational definition, which went on to dominate psychological method for the whole century.\n\nIn economics, practising researchers tend to emulate the methodological assumptions of classical positivism, but only in a \"de facto\" fashion: the majority of economists do not explicitly concern themselves with matters of epistemology. Economic thinker Friedrich Hayek (see \"Law, Legislation and Liberty\") rejected positivism in the social sciences as hopelessly limited in comparison to evolved and divided knowledge. For example, much (positivist) legislation falls short in contrast to pre-literate or incompletely defined common or evolved law. In jurisprudence, \"legal positivism\" essentially refers to the rejection of natural law; thus its common meaning with philosophical positivism is somewhat attenuated and in recent generations generally emphasizes the authority of human political structures as opposed to a \"scientific\" view of law.\n\nIn the early 1970s, urbanists of the positivist-quantitative school like David Harvey started to question the positivist approach itself, saying that the arsenal of scientific theories and methods developed so far in their camp were \"incapable of saying anything of depth and profundity\" on the real problems of contemporary cities.\n\nIn contemporary social science, strong accounts of positivism have long since fallen out of favour. Practitioners of positivism today acknowledge in far greater detail observer bias and structural limitations. Modern positivists generally eschew metaphysical concerns in favour of methodological debates concerning clarity, replicability, reliability and validity. This positivism is generally equated with \"quantitative research\" and thus carries no explicit theoretical or philosophical commitments. The institutionalization of this kind of sociology is often credited to Paul Lazarsfeld, who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analyzing them. This approach lends itself to what Robert K. Merton called middle-range theory: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.\n\nOther new movements, such as critical realism, have emerged to reconcile the overarching aims of social science with postmodern critiques. There are now at least twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.\n\nAuguste Comte (1798–1857) first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in \"The Course in Positive Philosophy\", a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1844 work, \"A General View of Positivism\" (published in French 1848, English in 1865). The first three volumes of the \"Course\" dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence (mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology), whereas the latter two emphasized the inevitable coming of social science. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term. For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex \"Queen science\" of human society itself. His \"View of Positivism\" therefore set out to define the empirical goals of sociological method.\n\nComte offered an account of social evolution, proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general \"law of three stages\". The idea bears some similarity to Marx's belief that human society would progress toward a communist peak (see dialectical materialism). This is perhaps unsurprising as both were profoundly influenced by the early Utopian socialist, Henri de Saint-Simon, who was at one time Comte's mentor. Comte intended to develop a secular-scientific ideology in the wake of European secularisation.\n\nComte's stages were (1) the \"theological\", (2) the \"metaphysical\", and (3) the \"positive\". The theological phase of man was based on whole-hearted belief in all things with reference to God. God, Comte says, had reigned supreme over human existence pre-Enlightenment. Humanity's place in society was governed by its association with the divine presences and with the church. The theological phase deals with humankind's accepting the doctrines of the church (or place of worship) rather than relying on its rational powers to explore basic questions about existence. It dealt with the restrictions put in place by the religious organization at the time and the total acceptance of any \"fact\" adduced for society to believe. Comte describes the metaphysical phase of humanity as the time since the Enlightenment, a time steeped in logical rationalism, to the time right after the French Revolution. This second phase states that the universal rights of humanity are most important. The central idea is that humanity is invested with certain rights that must be respected. In this phase, democracies and dictators rose and fell in attempts to maintain the innate rights of humanity.\n\nThe final stage of the trilogy of Comte's universal law is the scientific, or positive, stage. The central idea of this phase is that individual rights are more important than the rule of any one person. Comte stated that the idea of humanity's ability to govern itself makes this stage inherently different from the rest. There is no higher power governing the masses and the intrigue of any one person can achieve anything based on that individual's free will. The third principle is most important in the positive stage. Comte calls these three phases the universal rule in relation to society and its development. Neither the second nor the third phase can be reached without the completion and understanding of the preceding stage. All stages must be completed in progress.\n\nComte believed that the appreciation of the past and the ability to build on it towards the future was key in transitioning from the theological and metaphysical phases. The idea of progress was central to Comte's new science, sociology. Sociology would \"lead to the historical consideration of every science\" because \"the history of one science, including pure political history, would make no sense unless it was attached to the study of the general progress of all of humanity\". As Comte would say: \"from science comes prediction; from prediction comes action.\" It is a philosophy of human intellectual development that culminated in science. The irony of this series of phases is that though Comte attempted to prove that human development has to go through these three stages, it seems that the positivist stage is far from becoming a realization. This is due to two truths: The positivist phase requires having a complete understanding of the universe and world around us and requires that society should never know if it is in this positivist phase. Anthony Giddens argues that since humanity constantly uses science to discover and research new things, humanity never progresses beyond the second metaphysical phase.\n\nComte's fame today owes in part to Emile Littré, who founded \"The Positivist Review\" in 1867. As an approach to the philosophy of history, positivism was appropriated by historians such as Hippolyte Taine. Many of Comte's writings were translated into English by the Whig writer, Harriet Martineau, regarded by some as the first female sociologist. Debates continue to rage as to how much Comte appropriated from the work of his mentor, Saint-Simon. He was nevertheless influential: Brazilian thinkers turned to Comte's ideas about training a scientific elite in order to flourish in the industrialization process. Brazil's national motto, \"Ordem e Progresso\" (\"Order and Progress\") was taken from the positivism motto, \"Love as principle, order as the basis, progress as the goal\", which was also influential in Poland.\n\nIn later life, Comte developed a 'religion of humanity' for positivist societies in order to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849, he proposed a calendar reform called the 'positivist calendar'. For close associate John Stuart Mill, it was possible to distinguish between a \"good Comte\" (the author of the \"Course in Positive Philosophy\") and a \"bad Comte\" (the author of the secular-religious \"system\"). The \"system\" was unsuccessful but met with the publication of Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" to influence the proliferation of various Secular Humanist organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as George Holyoake and Richard Congreve. Although Comte's English followers, including George Eliot and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to \"vivre pour autrui\" (\"live for others\", from which comes the word \"altruism\").\n\nThe early sociology of Herbert Spencer came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as socially Darwinistic terms.\n\nFabien Magnin was the first working class adherent to Comte's ideas. Comte appointed him as his successor as president of the Positive Society in the event of Comte's death. Magnin filled this role from 1857 to 1880, when he resigned. Magnin was in touch with the English positivists Richard Congreve and Edward Spencer Beesly. He established the Cercle des prolétaires positivistes in 1863 which was affiliated to the First International. Eugène Sémérie was a psychiatrist who was also involved in the Positivist movement, setting up a positivist club in Paris after the foundation of the French Third Republic in 1870. \"Positivism is not only a philosophical doctrine, it is also a political party which claims to reconcile order – the necessary basis for all social activity – with Progress, which is its goal.\" he wrote.\n\nThe modern academic discipline of sociology began with the work of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917). While Durkheim rejected much of the details of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895, publishing his \"Rules of the Sociological Method\" (1895). In this text he argued: \"[o]ur main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism.\"\n\nDurkheim's seminal monograph, \"Suicide\" (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst Catholic and Protestant populations, distinguished sociological analysis from psychology or philosophy. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or psychological) causes. He developed the notion of objective \"sui generis\" \"social facts\" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study. Through such studies, he posited, sociology would be able to determine whether a given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or \"social anomie\". Durkheim described sociology as the \"science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning\".\n\nAshley Ornstein has alleged, in a consumer textbook published by Pearson Education, that accounts of Durkheim's positivism are possibly exaggerated and oversimplified; Comte was the only major sociological thinker to postulate that the social realm may be subject to scientific analysis in exactly the same way as natural science, whereas Durkheim saw a far greater need for a distinctly sociological scientific methodology. His lifework was fundamental in the establishment of practical social research as we know it today—techniques which continue beyond sociology and form the methodological basis of other social sciences, such as political science, as well of market research and other fields.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists formally introduced methodological antipositivism, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural norms, values, symbols, and social processes viewed from a subjective perspective. Max Weber argued that sociology may be loosely described as a 'science' as it is able to identify causal relationships—especially among ideal types, or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena. As a nonpositivist, however, one seeks relationships that are not as \"ahistorical, invariant, or generalizable\" as those pursued by natural scientists. Weber regarded sociology as the study of social action, using critical analysis and verstehen techniques. The sociologists Georg Simmel, Ferdinand Tönnies, George Herbert Mead, and Charles Cooley were also influential in the development of sociological antipositivism, whilst neo-Kantian philosophy, hermeneutics, and phenomenology facilitated the movement in general.\n\nKarl Marx's theory of historical materialism and critical analysis drew upon positivism, a tradition which would continue in the development of critical theory. However, following in the tradition of both Weber and Marx, the critical theorist Jürgen Habermas has critiqued pure instrumental rationality (in its relation to the cultural \"rationalisation\" of the modern West) as meaning that scientific thinking becomes something akin to ideology itself. Positivism may be espoused by \"technocrats\" who believe in the inevitability of social progress through science and technology. New movements, such as critical realism, have emerged in order to reconcile postpositivist aims with various so-called 'postmodern' perspectives on the social acquisition of knowledge.\n\nIn the original Comtean usage, the term \"positivism\" roughly meant the use of scientific methods to uncover the laws according to which both physical and human events occur, while \"sociology\" was the overarching science that would synthesize all such knowledge for the betterment of society. \"Positivism is a way of understanding based on science\"; people don't rely on the faith of God but instead of the science behind humanity. \"Antipositivism\" formally dates back to the start of the twentieth century, and is based on the belief that natural and human sciences are ontologically and epistemologically distinct. Neither of these terms is used any longer in this sense. There are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism. Many of these approaches do not self-identify as \"positivist\", some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism, and some because the label has over time become a term of abuse by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical empiricism. The extent of antipositivist criticism has also become broad, with many philosophies broadly rejecting the scientifically based social epistemology and other ones only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th century developments in the philosophy of science. However, positivism (understood as the use of scientific methods for studying society) remains the dominant approach to both the research and the theory construction in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States.\n\nThe majority of articles published in leading American sociology and political science journals today are positivist (at least to the extent of being quantitative rather than qualitative). This popularity may be because research utilizing positivist quantitative methodologies holds a greater prestige in the social sciences than qualitative work; quantitative work is easier to justify, as data can be manipulated to answer any question. Such research is generally perceived as being more scientific and more trustworthy, and thus has a greater impact on policy and public opinion (though such judgments are frequently contested by scholars doing non-positivist work).\n\nThe contestation over positivism is reflected in older (see the Positivism dispute) and current debates over the proper role of science in the public sphere. Public sociology—especially as described by Michael Burawoy—argues that sociologists should use empirical evidence to display the problems of society so they might be changed. Conversely, Thibodeaux argued that critical theory—public sociology in particular—relies on a dialectical, unilineal evolutionary view of social change. If a public sociologists assumes a multi-lineal interpretation of social change, public sociology will fail to affect social change for three reasons: (1) there's no objective criteria for the assessment of different goals (2) the rejection of one goal does not necessarily lead to an adherence to some other particular goal and (3) criticizing a goal maintains its relevance at the expense of possible alternatives.\n\nLogical positivism (later and more accurately called logical empiricism) is a school of philosophy that combines empiricism, the idea that observational evidence is indispensable for knowledge of the world, with a version of rationalism, the idea that our knowledge includes a component that is not derived from observation.\n\nLogical positivism grew from the discussions of a group called the \"First Vienna Circle\" which gathered at the Café Central before World War I. After the war Hans Hahn, a member of that early group, helped bring Moritz Schlick to Vienna. Schlick's Vienna Circle, along with Hans Reichenbach's Berlin Circle, propagated the new doctrines more widely in the 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nIt was Otto Neurath's advocacy that made the movement self-conscious and more widely known. A 1929 pamphlet written by Neurath, Hahn, and Rudolf Carnap summarized the doctrines of the Vienna Circle at that time. These included: the opposition to all metaphysics, especially ontology and synthetic \"a priori\" propositions; the rejection of metaphysics not as wrong but as meaningless (i.e., not empirically verifiable); a criterion of meaning based on Ludwig Wittgenstein's early work (which he himself later set out to refute); the idea that all knowledge should be codifiable in a single standard language of science; and above all the project of \"rational reconstruction,\" in which ordinary-language concepts were gradually to be replaced by more precise equivalents in that standard language. However, the project is widely considered to have failed.\n\nAfter moving to the United States, Carnap proposed a replacement for the earlier doctrines in his \"Logical Syntax of Language\". This change of direction, and the somewhat differing beliefs of Reichenbach and others, led to a consensus that the English name for the shared doctrinal platform, in its American exile from the late 1930s, should be \"logical empiricism.\" While the logical positivism movement is now considered dead, it has continued to influence philosophy development.\n\nHistorical positivism is the historiographical view that historical evidence requires no interpretation, the work of the historian being to compile the primary sources, “letting them speak for themselves”. Many of its tenets were later contradicted by Postmodernism.\n\nWithin years of the publication of Comte's book \"A General View of Positivism\" (1848), other scientific and philosophical thinkers began creating their own definitions for positivism. They included Émile Zola, Emile Hennequin, Wilhelm Scherer, and Dimitri Pisarev. Émile Zola was an influential French novelist, the most important example of the literary school of naturalism, and a major figure in the political liberalization of France.\n\nEmile Hennequin was a Parisian publisher and writer who wrote theoretical and critical pieces. He \"exemplified the tension between the positivist drive to systematize literary criticism and the unfettered imagination inherent in literature.\" He was one of the few thinkers who disagreed with the notion that subjectivity invalidates observation, judgment and prediction. Unlike many positivist thinkers before him, he believed that subjectivity does play a role in science and society. His contribution to positivism pertains not to science and its objectivity, but rather to the subjectivity of art and the way artists, their work, and audiences interrelate. Hennequin tried to analyse positivism strictly on the predictions, and the mechanical processes, but was perplexed due to the contradictions of the reactions of patrons to artwork that showed no scientific inclinations.\n\nWilhelm Scherer was a German philologist, a university professor, and a popular literary historian. He was known as a positivist because he based much of his work on \"hypotheses on detailed historical research, and rooted every literary phenomenon in 'objective' historical or philological facts\". His positivism is different due to his involvement with his nationalist goals. His major contribution to the movement was his speculation that culture cycled in a six-hundred-year period.\n\nDimitri Pisarev was a Russian critic who showed the greatest contradictions with his belief in positivism. His ideas incorporated imagination and style though he did not believe in romantic ideas because they reminded him of the oppressive tsarist government under which he lived. His basic beliefs were \"an extreme anti-aesthetic scientistic position.\" He focused his efforts on defining the relation between literature and the environment.\nStephen Hawking was a recent high-profile advocate of positivism, at least in the physical sciences. In \"The Universe in a Nutshell\" (p. 31) he wrote:\n\nAny sound scientific theory, whether of time or of any other concept, should in my opinion be based on the most workable philosophy of science: the positivist approach put forward by Karl Popper and others. According to this way of thinking, a scientific theory is a mathematical model that describes and codifies the observations we make. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple postulates and will make definite predictions that can be tested. ... If one takes the positivist position, as I do, one cannot say what time actually is. All one can do is describe what has been found to be a very good mathematical model for time and say what predictions it makes.\n\nHowever, the claim that Popper was a positivist is a common misunderstanding that Popper himself termed the \"Popper legend.\" In fact, he developed his beliefs in stark opposition to and as a criticism of positivism and held that scientific theories talk about how the world really is, not, as positivists claim, about phenomena or observations experienced by scientists. In the same vein, continental philosophers like Theodor Adorno and Jürgen Habermas regarded Popper as a positivist because of his alleged devotion to a unified science. However, this was also part of the \"Popper legend\"; Popper had in fact been the foremost critic of this doctrine of the Vienna Circle, critiquing it, for instance, in his \"Conjectures and Refutations\".\n\nThe key features of positivism as of the 1950s, as defined in the \"received view\", are:\n\nPositivism is elsewhere defined as the belief that all true knowledge is scientific, and that all things are ultimately measurable. Positivism is closely related to reductionism, in that both involve the belief that \"entities of one kind... are reducible to entities of another,\" such as societies to configurations of individuals, or mental events to neural phenomena. It also involves the contention that \"processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events,\" and even that \"social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals,\" or that \"biological organisms are reducible to physical systems.\"\n\nWhile most social scientists today are not explicit about their epistemological commitments, articles in top American sociology and political science journals generally follow a positivist logic of argument. It can be thus argued that \"natural science and social science [research articles] can therefore be regarded with a good deal of confidence as members of the same genre\".\n\nHistorically, positivism has been criticized for its reductionism, i.e., for contending that all \"processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events,\" \"social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals,\" and that \"biological organisms are reducible to physical systems.\"\n\nMax Horkheimer criticized the classic formulation of positivism on two grounds. First, he claimed that it falsely represented human social action. The first criticism argued that positivism systematically failed to appreciate the extent to which the so-called social facts it yielded did not exist 'out there', in the objective world, but were themselves a product of socially and historically mediated human consciousness. Positivism ignored the role of the 'observer' in the constitution of social reality and thereby failed to consider the historical and social conditions affecting the representation of social ideas. Positivism falsely represented the object of study by reifying social reality as existing objectively and independently and labour actually produced those conditions. Secondly, he argued, representation of social reality produced by positivism was inherently and artificially conservative, helping to support the status quo, rather than challenging it. This character may also explain the popularity of positivism in certain political circles. Horkheimer argued, in contrast, that critical theory possessed a reflexive element lacking in the positivistic traditional theory.\n\nSome scholars today hold the beliefs critiqued in Horkheimer's work, but since the time of his writing critiques of positivism, especially from philosophy of science, have led to the development of postpositivism. This philosophy greatly relaxes the epistemological commitments of logical positivism and no longer claims a separation between the knower and the known. Rather than dismissing the scientific project outright, postpositivists seek to transform and amend it, though the exact extent of their affinity for science varies vastly. For example, some postpositivists accept the critique that observation is always value-laden, but argue that the best values to adopt for sociological observation are those of science: skepticism, rigor, and modesty. Just as some critical theorists see their position as a moral commitment to egalitarian values, these postpositivists see their methods as driven by a moral commitment to these scientific values. Such scholars may see themselves as either positivists or antipositivists.\n\nPositivism has also come under fire on religious and philosophical grounds, whose proponents state that truth begins in sense experience, but does not end there. Positivism fails to prove that there are not abstract ideas, laws, and principles, beyond particular observable facts and relationships and necessary principles, or that we cannot know them. Nor does it prove that material and corporeal things constitute the whole order of existing beings, and that our knowledge is limited to them. According to positivism, our abstract concepts or general ideas are mere collective representations of the experimental order—for example; the idea of \"man\" is a kind of blended image of all the men observed in our experience. This runs contrary to a Platonic or Christian ideal, where an idea can be abstracted from any concrete determination, and may be applied identically to an indefinite number of objects of the same class From the idea's perspective, Platonism is more precise. Defining an idea as a sum of collective images is imprecise and more or less confused, and becomes more so as the collection represented increases. An idea defined explicitly always remains clear.\n\nExperientialism, which arose with second generation cognitive science, asserts that knowledge begins and ends with experience itself.\n\nEchoes of the \"positivist\" and \"antipositivist\" debate persist today, though this conflict is hard to define. Authors writing in different epistemological perspectives do not phrase their disagreements in the same terms and rarely actually speak directly to each other. To complicate the issues further, few practicing scholars explicitly state their epistemological commitments, and their epistemological position thus has to be guessed from other sources such as choice of methodology or theory. However, no perfect correspondence between these categories exists, and many scholars critiqued as \"positivists\" are actually postpositivists. One scholar has described this debate in terms of the social construction of the \"other\", with each side defining the other by what it is \"not\" rather than what it \"is\", and then proceeding to attribute far greater homogeneity to their opponents than actually exists. Thus, it is better to understand this not as a debate but as two different arguments: the \"antipositivist\" articulation of a social meta-theory which includes a philosophical critique of scientism, and \"positivist\" development of a scientific research methodology for sociology with accompanying critiques of the reliability and validity of work that they see as violating such standards.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18006792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18006792", "title": "Redneck", "text": "Redneck\n\nRedneck is a derogatory term chiefly but not exclusively applied to white Americans perceived to be crass and unsophisticated, closely associated with rural whites of the Southern United States. Its usage is similar in meaning to \"cracker\" (especially regarding Georgia, Texas, and Florida), \"hillbilly\" (especially regarding Appalachia and the Ozarks), and \"white trash\" (but without the last term's suggestions of immorality).\n\nBy the 1970s, the term had become offensive slang, its meaning expanded to include racism, loutishness, and opposition to modern ways.\n\nPatrick Huber, in his monograph \"A Short History of Redneck: The Fashioning of a Southern White Masculine Identity\", emphasized the theme of masculinity in the 20th-century expansion of the term, noting, \"The redneck has been stereotyped in the media and popular culture as a poor, dirty, uneducated, and racist Southern white man.\"\n\nThe term characterized farmers having a red neck caused by sunburn from hours working in the fields. A citation from <time>1893</time> provides a definition as \"poorer inhabitants of the rural districts...men who work in the field, as a matter of course, generally have their skin stained red and burnt by the sun, and especially is this true of the back of their necks\".\n\nBy 1900, \"rednecks\" was in common use to designate the political factions inside the Democratic Party comprising poor white farmers in the South. The same group was also often called the \"wool hat boys\" (for they opposed the rich men, who wore expensive silk hats). A newspaper notice in Mississippi in August 1891 called on rednecks to rally at the polls at the upcoming primary election:\n\nBy <time>1910</time>, the political supporters of the Mississippi Democratic Party politician James K. Vardaman—chiefly poor white farmers—began to describe themselves proudly as \"rednecks,\" even to the point of wearing red neckerchiefs to political rallies and picnics.\n\nLinguist Sterling Eisiminger, based on the testimony of informants from the Southern United States, speculated that the prevalence of pellagra in the region during the great depression may have contributed to the rise in popularity of the term; red, inflamed skin is one of the first symptoms of that disorder to appear.\n\nThe term \"redneck\" in the early 20th century was occasionally used in reference to American coal miner union members who wore red bandanas for solidarity. The sense of \"a union man\" dates at least to the 1910s and was especially popular during the 1920s and 1930s in the coal-producing regions of West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania. It was also used by union strikers to describe poor white strikebreakers.\n\nWriters Edward Abbey and Dave Foreman also use \"redneck\" as a political call to mobilize poor rural white Southerners. \"In Defense of the Redneck\" was a popular essay by Ed Abbey. One popular early Earth First! bumper sticker was \"Rednecks for Wilderness\". Murray Bookchin, an urban leftist and social ecologist, objected strongly to Earth First!'s use of the term as \"at the very least, insensitive\". However, many Southerners have proudly embraced the term as a self-identifier. Similarly to Earth First!'s use, the self-described \"anti-racist, pro-gun, pro-labor\" group Redneck Revolt have used the term to signal its roots in the rural white working-class and celebration of what member Max Neely described as \"redneck culture\".\n\nAccording to Chapman and Kipfer in their \"Dictionary of American Slang\", By 1975 the term had expanded in meaning beyond the poor Southerner to refer to \"a bigoted and conventional person, a loutish ultra-conservative.\" For example, in 1960 John Barlow Martin expressed Senator John F. Kennedy should not enter the Indiana Democratic presidential primary because the state was \"redneck conservative country.\" Indiana, he told Kennedy, was a state \"suspicious of foreign entanglements, conservative in fiscal policy, and with a strong overlay of Southern segregationist sentiment.\" Writer William Safire observes it is often used to attack white Southern conservatives, and more broadly to degrade working class and rural whites that are perceived by urban progressives to be insufficiently liberal. At the same time, some white Southerners have reclaimed the word, using it with pride and defiance as a self-identifier.\n\n\nIn Scotland in the 1640s, the Covenanters rejected rule by bishops, often signing manifestos using their own blood. Some wore red cloth around their neck to signify their position, and were called rednecks by the Scottish ruling class to denote that they were the rebels in what came to be known as The Bishop's War that preceded the rise of Cromwell. Eventually, the term began to mean simply \"Presbyterian\", especially in communities along the Scottish border. Because of the large number of Scottish immigrants in the pre-revolutionary American South, some historians have suggested that this may be the origin of the term in the United States.\n\nDictionaries document the earliest American citation of the term's use for Presbyterians in <time>1830</time>, as \"a name bestowed upon the Presbyterians of Fayetteville [North Carolina]\".\n\nIn Northern England during the 19th and 20th centuries, Roman Catholics were known as rednecks.\n\nThe exact Afrikaans equivalent, \"\", is used as a disparaging term for English people and South Africans of English descent, in reference to their supposed naïveté as later arrivals in the region in failing to protect themselves from the sun.\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

Most universities in the world are organised into teaching and research divisions. Professors and lecturers will normally be contracted to do both and, in theory at least, course syllabi are structured around the teacher's research interests. Since the 1980s, there has been a growing movement to further integrate the two activities. This has led to a new interest in undergraduate research, where students enrolled on bachelor's degrees are given the opportunity to participate in research projects or undertake their own research.\n\nThis concept is also coined as Teaching-as-Research or Research-based Practices in Teaching in higher education. There are growing number of activities supported and sponsored by inter-university organizations such as the National Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) Network. \n\nThis practice was pioneered in America, where there is now a nationwide Council for Undergraduate Research, and in Australia. Recently, the UK Government funded several 'centres of excellence' which focus in different ways on undergraduate research. One of the most important is the Reinvention Centre for Undergraduate Research, which was set up in the Sociology department at Warwick University in partnership with the School of the Built Environment at Oxford Brookes University under the directorship of Mike Neary. The Centre's journal, Reinvention, launched in September 2007. In 2006, the UK Government also invested c.£25m into universities across the country to strengthen research-informed teaching. Key publications by Alan Jenkins, Roger Zetter, Mick Healey and Angela Brew have further developed the research base for research-informed teaching. In April 2007 the University of Central Lancashire appointed the first ever Chair in Research-informed Teaching, Stuart Hampton-Reeves, and in September 2007 launched a Centre for Research-informed Teaching.\n\nWhile university instruction is optimal when grounded in empirical findings, some concerns have arisen regarding the efficacy of university instruction at research focused institutions. A growing number of these higher education research institutions focus on the researching prowess of the potential professor (and, in many cases, the grant-writing ability of prospective employee) while often paying substantially less attention to one's ability to disseminate the information. Of course, those talented instructors who are both strong in research and instruction have the potential to really impact their students.\n\n"}
{"id": "57987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57987", "title": "Rudolf Carnap", "text": "Rudolf Carnap\n\nRudolf Carnap (; ; May 18, 1891 – September 14, 1970) was a German-born philosopher who was active in Europe before 1935 and in the United States thereafter. He was a major member of the Vienna Circle and an advocate of logical positivism. He is considered \"one of the giants among twentieth-century philosophers.\"\n\nCarnap's father had risen from the status of a poor ribbon-weaver to become the owner of a ribbon-making factory. His mother came from academic stock; her father was an educational reformer and her oldest brother was the archaeologist Wilhelm Dörpfeld. As a ten-year-old, Carnap accompanied his uncle on an expedition to Greece. Carnap was raised in a religious family, but later became an atheist.\n\nHe began his formal education at the Barmen Gymnasium. From 1910 to 1914, he attended the University of Jena, intending to write a thesis in physics. But he also studied carefully Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\" during a course taught by Bruno Bauch, and was one of very few students to attend Gottlob Frege's courses in mathematical logic. While Carnap held moral and political opposition to World War I, he felt obligated to serve in the German army. After three years of service, he was given permission to study physics at the University of Berlin, 1917–18, where Albert Einstein was a newly appointed professor. Carnap then attended the University of Jena, where he wrote a thesis defining an axiomatic theory of space and time. The physics department said it was too philosophical, and Bruno Bauch of the philosophy department said it was pure physics. Carnap then wrote another thesis in 1921, with Bauch's supervision, on the theory of space in a more orthodox Kantian style, and published as \"Der Raum\" (\"Space\") in a supplemental issue of \"Kant-Studien\" (1922). \n\nFrege's course exposed him to Bertrand Russell's work on logic and philosophy, which put a sense of the aims to his studies. He accepted the effort to surpass traditional philosophy with logical innovations that inform the sciences. He wrote a letter to Russell, who responded by copying by hand long passages from his \"Principia Mathematica\" for Carnap's benefit, as neither Carnap nor his university could afford a copy of this epochal work. In 1924 and 1925, he attended seminars led by Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology, and continued to write on physics from a logical positivist perspective.\n\nCarnap discovered a kindred spirit when he met Hans Reichenbach at a 1923 conference. Reichenbach introduced Carnap to Moritz Schlick, a professor at the University of Vienna who offered Carnap a position in his department, which Carnap accepted in 1926. Carnap thereupon joined an informal group of Viennese intellectuals that came to be known as the Vienna Circle, directed largely by Moritz Schlick and including Hans Hahn, Friedrich Waismann, Otto Neurath, and Herbert Feigl, with occasional visits by Hahn's student Kurt Gödel. When Wittgenstein visited Vienna, Carnap would meet with him. He (with Hahn and Neurath) wrote the 1929 manifesto of the Circle, and (with Hans Reichenbach) initiated the philosophy journal \"Erkenntnis\".\n\nIn February 1930 Tarski lectured in Vienna, and during November 1930 Carnap visited Warsaw. On these occasions he learned much about Tarski's model theoretic method of semantics. Rose Rand, another philosopher in the Vienna Circle, noted, \"Carnap's conception of semantics starts from the basis given in Tarski's work but a distinction is made between logical and non-logical constants and between logical and factual truth... At the same time he worked with the concepts of intension and extension and took these two concepts as a basis of a new method of semantics.\"\n\nIn 1931, Carnap was appointed Professor at the German University of Prague. In 1933, W. V. Quine met Carnap in Prague and discussed the latter's work at some length. Thus began the lifelong mutual respect these two men shared, one that survived Quine's eventual forceful disagreements with a number of Carnap's philosophical conclusions.\n\nCarnap, whose socialist and pacifist beliefs put him at risk in Nazi Germany, emigrated to the United States in 1935 and became a naturalized citizen in 1941. Meanwhile, back in Vienna, Moritz Schlick was murdered in 1936. From 1936 to 1952, Carnap was a professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago. During the late 1930s, Carnap offered an assistant position in philosophy to Carl Gustav Hempel, who accepted and became one of his most significant intellectual collaborator. Thanks partly to Quine's help, Carnap spent the years 1939–41 at Harvard, where he was reunited with Tarski. Carnap (1963) later expressed some irritation about his time at Chicago, where he and Charles W. Morris were the only members of the department committed to the primacy of science and logic. (Their Chicago colleagues included Richard McKeon, Mortimer Adler, Charles Hartshorne, and Manley Thompson.) Carnap's years at Chicago were nonetheless very productive ones. He wrote books on semantics (Carnap 1942, 1943, 1956), modal logic, and on the philosophical foundations of probability and induction (Carnap 1950, 1952).\n\nAfter a stint at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, he joined the philosophy department at UCLA in 1954, Hans Reichenbach having died the previous year. He had earlier refused an offer of a similar job at the University of California, because accepting that position required that he sign a loyalty oath, a practice to which he was opposed on principle. While at UCLA, he wrote on scientific knowledge, the analytic – synthetic dichotomy, and the verification principle. His writings on thermodynamics and on the foundations of probability and induction, were published posthumously as Carnap (1971, 1977, 1980).\n\nCarnap taught himself Esperanto when he was 14 years of age, and remained sympathetic to it (Carnap 1963). He later attended the World Congress of Esperanto in 1908 and 1922, and employed the language while traveling.\n\nCarnap had four children by his first marriage to Elizabeth Schöndube, which ended in divorce in 1929. He married his second wife, Elizabeth Ina Stöger, in 1933. Ina committed suicide in 1964.\n\nBelow is an examination of the main topics in the evolution of the philosophy of Rudolf Carnap. It is not exhaustive, but it outlines Carnap’s main works and contributions to modern epistemology and philosophy of logic. \n\nFrom 1919 to 1921, Carnap worked on a doctoral thesis called “Der Raum. Ein Beitrag zur Wissenschaftslehre” (1922). In this dissertation on the philosophical foundations of geometry, Carnap tried to provide a logical basis for a theory of space and time in physics. Considering that Carnap was interested in pure mathematics, natural sciences and philosophy, his dissertation can be seen as an attempt to build a bridge between the different disciplines that are geometry, physics and philosophy. For Carnap thought that in many instances those disciplines use the same concepts, but with totally different meanings. The main objective of Carnap’s dissertation was to show that the inconsistencies between theories concerning space only existed because philosophers, as well as mathematicians and scientists, were talking about different things while using the same “space” word. Hence, Carnap characteristically argued that there had to be three separate notions of space. “Formal” space is space in the sense of mathematics: it is an abstract system of relations. “Intuitive” space is made of certain contents of intuition independent of single experiences. “Physical” space is made of actual spatial facts given in experience. The upshot is that those three kinds of “space” imply three different kinds of knowledge and thus three different kinds of investigations. It is interesting to note that it is in this dissertation that the main themes of Carnap’s philosophy appear, most importantly the idea that many philosophical contradictions appear because of a misuse of language, and a stress on the importance of distinguishing formal and material modes of speech.  \n\nFrom 1922 to 1925, Carnap worked on a book which became one of his major works, namely \"Der logische Aufbau der Welt\" (1928) (translated as “The logical structure of the world”, 1967). That achievement has become a landmark in modern epistemology and can be read as a forceful statement of the philosophical thesis of logical positivism. Indeed, the Aufbau suggests that epistemology, based on modern symbolic logic, is concerned with the logical analysis of scientific propositions, while science itself, based on experience, is the only source of knowledge of the external world, i.e. the world outside the realm of human perception. According to Carnap, philosophical propositions are statements about the language of science; they aren’t true or false, but merely consist of definitions and conventions about the use of certain concepts. In contrast, scientific propositions are factual statements about the external reality. They are meaningful because they are based on the perceptions of the senses. In other words, the truth or falsity of those propositions can be verified by testing their content with further observations.  \n\nIn the Aufbau, Carnap wants to display the logical and conceptual structure with which all scientific (factual) statements can be organized. Carnap gives the label “constitutional” to this epistemic-logical project. It is a constructive undertaking that systematizes scientific knowledge according to the notions of symbolic logic. Accordingly, the purpose of this constitutional system is to identify and discern different classes of scientific concepts and to specify the logical relations that link them. In the Aufbau, concepts are taken to denote objects, relations, properties, classes and states. Carnap argues that all concepts must be ranked over a hierarchy. In that hierarchy, all concepts are organized according to a fundamental arrangement where concepts can be reduced and converted to other basic ones. Carnap explains that a concept can be reduced to another when all sentences containing the first concept can be transformed into sentences containing the other. In other words, every scientific sentence should be translatable into another sentence such that the original terms have the same reference as the translated terms. Most significantly, Carnap argues that the basis of this system is psychological. Its content is the “immediately given”, which is made of basic elements, namely perceptual experiences. These basic elements consist of conscious psychological states of a single human subject. In the end, Carnap argues that his constitutional project demonstrates the possibility of defining and uniting all scientific concepts in a single conceptual system on the basis of a few fundamental concepts.    \n\nFrom 1928 to 1934, Carnap published papers (\"Scheinprobleme in der Philosophie,\" 1928 – translated as “Pseudoproblems in Philosophy”, 1967) in which he appears overtly skeptical of the aims and methods of metaphysics, i.e. the traditional philosophy that finds its roots in mythical and religious thought. Indeed, he discusses how, in many cases, metaphysics is made of meaningless discussions of pseudo-problems. For Carnap, a pseudo-problem is a philosophical question which, on the surface, handles concepts that refer to our world while, in fact, these concepts do not actually denote real and attested objects. In other words, these pseudo-problems concern statements that do not, in any way, have empirical implications. They do not refer to states of affairs and the things they denote cannot be perceived. Consequently, one of Carnap’s main aim has been to redefine the purpose and method of philosophy. According to him, philosophy should not aim at producing any knowledge transcending the knowledge of science. In contrast, by analyzing the language and propositions of science, philosophers should define the logical foundations of scientific knowledge. Using symbolic logic, they should explicate the concepts, methods and justificatory processes that exist in science. \n\nCarnap believed that the difficulty with traditional philosophy lied in the use of concepts that are not useful for science. For Carnap, the scientific legitimacy of these concepts was doubtful, because the sentences containing them do not express facts. Indeed, a logical analysis of those sentences proves that they do not convey the meaning of states of affairs. In other words, theses sentences are meaningless. Carnap explains that to be meaningful, a sentence should be factual. It can be so, for one thing, by being based on experience, i.e. by being formulated with words relating to direct observations. For another, a sentence is factual if one can clearly state what are the observations that could confirm or disconfirm that sentence. After all, Carnap presupposes a specific criterion of meaning, namely the wittgensteinian principle of verifiability. Indeed, he requires, as a precondition of meaningfulness, that all sentences be verifiable, what implies that a sentence is meaningful only if there is a way to verify if it is true or false. To verify a sentence, one needs to expound the empirical conditions and circumstances that would establish the truth of the sentence. As a result, it is clear for Carnap that metaphysical sentences are meaningless. They include concepts like “god”, “soul” and “the absolute” that transcend experience and cannot be traced back or connected to direct observations. Because those sentences cannot be verified in any way, Carnap suggests that science, as well as philosophy, should neither consider nor contain them. \n\nAt that point in his career, Carnap attempted to develop a full theory of the logical structure of scientific language. This theory, exposed in \"Logische Syntax der Sprache\" (1934) (translated as “The logical syntax of language”, 1937) gives the foundations to his idea that scientific language has a specific formal structure and that its signs are governed by the rules of deductive logic. Moreover, the theory of logical syntax expounds a method with which one can talk about a language: it is a formal meta-theory about the pure forms of language. In the end, because Carnap argues that philosophy aims at the logical analysis of the language of science and thus is the logic of science, the theory of the logical syntax can be considered as a definite language and a conceptual framework for philosophy. \n\nThe logical syntax of language is a formal theory. It is not concerned with the contextualized meaning or the truth-value of sentences. In contrast, it considers the general structure of a given language and explores the different structural relations that connect the elements of that language. Hence, by explaining the different operations that allow specific transformations within the language, the theory is a systematic exposition of the rules that operate within that language. In fact, the basic function of these rules is to provide the principles to safeguard coherence, to avoid contradictions and to deduce justified conclusions. It is to be noted that Carnap sees language as a calculus. This calculus is a systematic arrangement of symbols and relations. The symbols of the language are organized according to the class they belong to and it is through their combination that we can form sentences. The relations are different conditions under which a sentence can be said to follow, or to be the consequence, of another sentence. The definitions included in the calculus state the conditions under which a sentence can be considered of a certain type and how those sentences can be transformed. We can see the logical syntax as a method of formal transformation, i.e. a method for calculating and reasoning with symbols. \n\nIt is in the \"logical syntax\" that Carnap introduces his notable principle of tolerance. This principle suggests that there is no moral in logic. When it comes to using a language, there is no good or bad, fundamentally true or false. In this perspective, the philosopher’s task is not to bring authoritative interdicts prohibiting the use of certain concepts. In contrast, philosophers should seek general agreements over the relevance of certain logical devices. According to Carnap, those agreements are possible only through the detailed presentation of the meaning and use of the expressions of a language. In other words, Carnap believes that every logical language is correct only if this language is supported by exact definitions and not by philosophical presumptions. It is to be noted that Carnap embraces a formal conventionalism. That implies that formal languages are constructed and that everyone is free to choose the language it finds more suited to his purpose. There should not be any controversy over which language is the correct language; what matters is agreeing over which language best suits a particular purpose. Carnap explains that the choice of a language should be guided according to the security it provides against logical inconsistency. Furthermore, practical elements like simplicity and fruitfulness in certain tasks influence the choice of a language. Clearly enough, the principle of tolerance was a sophisticated device introduced by Carnap to dismiss any form of dogmatism in philosophy.    \n\nAfter having considered problems in semantics, i.e. the theory of the concepts of meaning and truth (\"Foundations of Logic and Mathematics,\" 1939; \"Introduction to Semantics,\" 1942; \"Formalization of Logic\", 1943), Carnap turned his attention to the subject of probability and inductive logic. His views on that subject are for the most part exposed in \"Logical foundations of probability\" (1950) where Carnap aims to give a sound logical interpretation of probability. Carnap thought that according to certain conditions, the concept of probability had to be interpreted as a purely logical concept. In this view, probability is a basic concept anchored in all inductive inferences, whereby the conclusion of every inference that holds without deductive necessity is said be more or less likely to be the case. In fact, Carnap claims that the problem of induction is a matter of finding a precise explanation of the logical relation that holds between a hypothesis and the evidence that supports it. An inductive logic is thus based on the idea that probability is a logical relation between two types of statements: the hypothesis (conclusion) and the premises (evidence). Accordingly, a theory of induction should explain how, by pure logical analysis, we can ascertain that certain evidence establishes a degree of confirmation strong enough to confirm a given hypothesis. \n\nCarnap was convinced that there was a logical as well as an empirical dimension in science. He believed that one had to isolate the experiential elements from the logical elements of a given body of knowledge. Hence, the empirical concept of frequency used in statistics to describe the general features of certain phenomena can be distinguished from the analytical concepts of probability logic that merely describe logical relations between sentences. For Carnap, the statistical and the logical concepts must be investigated separately. Having insisted on this distinction, Carnap defines two concepts of probability. The first one is logical and deals with the degree to which a given hypothesis is confirmed by a piece of evidence. It is the \"degree of confirmation\". The second is empirical, and relates to the long run rate of one observable feature of nature relative to another. It is the \"relative frequency.\" Statements belonging to the second concepts are about reality and describe states of affairs. They are empirical and, therefore, must be based on experimental procedures and the observation of relevant facts. On the contrary, statements belonging to the first concept do not say anything about facts. Their meaning can be grasped solely with an analysis of the signs they contain. They are analytical sentences, i.e. true by virtue of their logical meaning. Even though these sentences could refer to states of affairs, their meaning is given by the symbols and relations they contain. In other words, the probability of a conclusion is given by the logical relation it has to the evidence. The evaluation of the degree of confirmation of a hypothesis is thus a problem of meaning analysis. \n\nClearly, the probability of a statement about relative frequency can be unknown; because it depends on the observation of certain phenomena, one may not possess the information needed to establish the value of that probability. Consequently, the value of that statement can be confirmed only if it is corroborated with facts. In contrast, the probability of a statement about the degree of confirmation could be unknown, in the sense that one may miss the correct logical method to evaluate its exact value. But, such a statement can always receive a certain logical value, given the fact that this value only depends on the meaning of its symbols.              \n\nThe Carnap Papers consist of approximately 10,000 personal letters of correspondence. The papers were donated by his daughter, Hanna Carnap-Thost in 1974. Documents that contain financial, medical, and personal information are restricted. These were written over his entire life and career. Carnap used the mail regularly to discuss philosophical problems with hundreds of others. The most notable were: Herbert Feigl, Carl Gustav Hempel, Felix Kaufmann, Otto Neurath, and Moritz Schlick. Photographs are also part of the collection and were taken throughout his life. Family pictures and photographs of his peers and colleagues are also stored in the collection. Some of the correspondence is considered notable and consist of his student notes, his seminars with Frege, (describing the \"Begriffsschrift\" and the logic in mathematics). Carnap's notes from Russell's seminar in Chicago, and notes he took from discussions with Tarski, Heisenberg, Quine, Hempel, Gödel, Jeffrey are part of the University of Pittsburgh's Archives and Collections. Digitized contents include:\n\n\nMore than 1,000 pages of lecture outlines are preserved that cover the courses that Carnap taught in the United States, Prague, and Vienna, Prague. Drafts of his published works and unpublished works are part of the collection. includes manuscript drafts and typescripts both for his published works and for many unpublished papers and books.

{"id": "671736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=671736", "title": "Tall poppy syndrome", "text": "Tall poppy syndrome\n\nThe tall poppy syndrome describes aspects of a culture where people of high status are resented, attacked, cut down, strung up or criticised because they have been classified as superior to their peers. The term has been used in cultures of the English-speaking world.\n\nThe concept originates from accounts in Herodotus' \"Histories\" (Book 5, 92f), Aristotle's \"Politics\" (1284a), and Livy's \"Ab Urbe Condita Libri\", Book I.\nAristotle uses Herodotus' story in his \"Politics\" (1284a) with reversed roles, referring to Periander's advice to Thrasybulus via a herald.\n\nThe specific reference to poppies occurs in Livy's account of the tyrannical Roman king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. He is said to have received a messenger from his son Sextus Tarquinius asking what he should do next in Gabii, since he had become all-powerful there. Rather than answering the messenger verbally, Tarquin went into his garden, took a stick, and symbolically swept it across his garden, thus cutting off the heads of the tallest poppies that were growing there. The messenger, tired of waiting for an answer, returned to Gabii and told Sextus what he had seen. Sextus realised that his father wished him to put to death all of the most eminent people of Gabii, which he then did.\n\nThe earliest English-language example of Tall Poppies being used as a metaphor for notables may be found in Roger L'Estrange's newspaper, \"The Observator\", in 1710. One party to a dialogue relates the tale of Tarquin, and later observes approvingly of his Royalist allies, \"If you'll have but a little Patience, you may see them make very noble Efforts towards striking off the Heads of the tall Poppies.\"\n\nBy 1835, the metaphor had crossed the Atlantic to the United States, where the \"Torch Light\" of Hagerstown, Maryland, observed of then-Congressman Francis Thomas, \"Politically, Mr. Thomas and his friends are imitating the example of Tarquin and Sextius – indeed it is said some of the tall poppies of our county are in danger of decapitation.\"\n\nThere is a similar legend about the king Ramiro II of Aragon, who asked for some advice to his old master to deal with some nobles who questioned his power. His master did not say anything but just cut the heads of the tallest roses in the garden. This legend is known as the \"Bell of Huesca\".\n\nThe phrase can be found as early as 1864 in a controversy over the awarding of a knighthood:\n\nAgain in 1904 in a report of a debate in the Federal Parliament:\n\nIn 1930 one may read:\n\nThe phrase has been in more common use since Jack Lang, Premier of New South Wales, described his egalitarian policies as \"cutting the heads off tall poppies\" in 1931. \"Mr. Lang made some of the tall poppies suffer who could be made to suffer.\" \"The tall poppies of the party had dragged Mr. Lang's name into the debate to cloud the issue.\"\n\nThe phrase experienced a revival with the publication of Susan Mitchell's best-selling book \"Tall Poppies\" in 1984 in which Mitchell interviewed nine successful Australian women.\n\nOf the Australian definition, Peter Hartcher of the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" writes, \"(Australian) citizens know that some among them will have more power and money than others... But according to the unspoken national ethos, no Australian is permitted to assume that he or she is better than any other Australian. How is this enforced? By the prompt corrective of levelling derision. It has a name—The \"Tall Poppy Syndrome\". The tallest flowers in the field will be cut down to the same size as all the others. This is sometimes misunderstood... It isn't success that offends Australians. It's the affront committed by anyone who starts to put on superior airs.\"\n\nPrior to becoming British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher explained her philosophy to an American audience as \"let your poppies grow tall.\" \n\nThe quote was made in the United States for political purposes and any assertion that the United Kingdom itself has a culture of tall poppy syndrome in the crab mentality sense like Australia and New Zealand has been disputed.\n\nBelief in the strength of this cultural phenomenon, and the degree to which it represents a negative trait, is to some extent influenced by politics. Tall poppy syndrome is related to what some call \"the politics of envy\".\n\nSome commentators have argued that tall poppy syndrome is a universal phenomenon, that is more common in some cultures. The concepts of \"janteloven\" or \"Law of Jante\", in Scandinavia, and \"A kent yer faither\" (English: \"I knew your father\") in Scotland, are very similar. Similar phenomena are said to exist in the Netherlands (where it is called \"maaiveldcultuur\"). In the United States, Benjamin Franklin Fairless, president of United States Steel Corporation (1950), criticised such behaviour when he stated: \"You cannot strengthen one by weakening another; and you cannot add to the stature of a dwarf by cutting off the leg of a giant\".\n\nSome sociologists, notably Max Weber, believe that in certain social groups, the acquisition of prestige and power is a zero-sum game, and this situation may provide a rationalisation for the dislike of \"tall poppies\". In such groups, there is only a limited amount of prestige for its members to share in and only a fixed quantity of attention, authority and material resources that its members can give to each other. Status is a relative value, so for someone to rise in status, another person must fall. A person who is more prestigious is an obstacle to another person's rise simply by being more prestigious, and a person who suddenly rises is an outright threat to the other's current status. Humiliating or sabotaging a popular member of the group will lower that person's status and thus make it possible for the aggressor to supplant him in the group hierarchy.\n\nThis zero-sum pattern can be found in small groups characterised by fixed hierarchies and where there is little movement in or out of the group. Examples include poor American communities and some street gangs. A related concept is that of a crab mentality in which successful members of a disadvantaged community are seen as undermining the standing of other community members. The image is drawn from the observation that a crab clawing its way out of a bucket (or barrel in other versions) is pulled back down by its fellows.\n\nRecent research performed at University of Waikato in New Zealand shows that a culture of tall poppy syndrome may result in a reduction in average performance of up to 20% for an organisation and explains how electronic cyberbullying can be considered a modern extension to the physical assassinations of King Tarquin's day.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8146278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8146278", "title": "Test anxiety", "text": "Test anxiety\n\nTest anxiety is a combination of physiological over-arousal, tension and somatic symptoms, along with worry, dread, fear of failure, and catastrophizing, that occur before or during test situations. It is a physiological condition in which people experience extreme stress, anxiety, and discomfort during and/or before taking a test. This anxiety creates significant barriers to learning and performance. Research suggests that high levels of emotional distress have a direct correlation to reduced academic performance and higher overall student drop-out rates. Test anxiety can have broader consequences, negatively affecting a student's social, emotional and behavioural development, as well as their feelings about themselves and school.\n\nHighly test-anxious students score about 12 percentile points below their low anxiety peers. Test anxiety is prevalent amongst the student populations of the world. It has been studied formally since the early 1950s beginning with researchers George Mandler and Seymour Sarason. Sarason's brother, Irwin G. Sarason, then contributed to early investigation of test anxiety, clarifying the relationship between the focused effects of test anxiety, other focused forms of anxiety, and generalized anxiety.\n\nTest anxiety can also be labeled as anticipatory anxiety, situational anxiety or evaluation anxiety. Some anxiety is normal and often helpful to stay mentally and physically alert. When one experiences too much anxiety, however, it can result in emotional or physical distress, difficulty concentrating, and emotional worry. Inferior performance arises not because of intellectual problems or poor academic preparation, but because testing situations create a sense of threat for those experiencing test anxiety; anxiety resulting from the sense of threat then disrupts attention and memory function. Researchers suggest that between 25 and 40 percent of students experience test anxiety. Students with disabilities and students in gifted educations classes tend to experience high rates of test anxiety. Students who experience test anxiety tend to be easily distracted during a test, experience difficulty with comprehending relatively simple instructions, and have trouble organizing or recalling relevant information.\n\nResearchers believe that feelings of anxiety arise to prepare a person for threats. In humans, anxiety symptoms are distributed along a continuum and different symptom levels of anxiety predict outcomes. Responses consist of increased heart rate, stress hormone secretion, restlessness, vigilance, and fear of a potentially dangerous environment. Anxiety prepares the body physically, cognitively, and behaviourally to detect and deal with threats to survival. As a result, a person’s body begins to hyperventilate to allow more oxygen to enter the bloodstream, divert blood to muscles, and sweat to cool the skin. In individuals, the degree to which an anxiety response is developed is based on the probability of bad things happening in the environment and the individual’s ability to cope with them. In the case of test taking, this might be a failing exam grade that prevents the student from being accepted to a post-secondary institution. A person's beliefs about their own competencies are a form of self-knowledge, which plays an important role in analyzing situations that might be threatening. When a person has feelings of low competence about their abilities they are likely to anticipate negative outcomes such as failure, under uncertain conditions. Thus, evaluative situations including tests and exams, are perceived as more threatening by students who have low competencies.\n\nThere is a difference between generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) and test anxiety. GAD is characterized by \"trait anxiety\" which results in a person experiencing high levels of stress across a wide range of situations. In contrast, people with test anxiety have a \"state anxiety\" which results in high levels of nervousness specific to testing.\n\nSymptoms of test anxiety can range from moderate to severe. \"Students who exhibit moderate symptoms are still able to perform relatively well on exams. Other students with severe anxiety will often experience panic attacks.\"\n\nCommon physical symptoms include: headache, upset stomach, feeling of fear, feeling of dread, shortness of breath, sweating, pacing or fidgeting, crying, racing thoughts and blanking out.\n\nDuring states of excitement or stress, the body releases adrenaline. Adrenaline is known to cause physical symptoms that accompany test anxiety, such as increased heart rate, sweating, and rapid breathing. In many cases having adrenaline is a good thing. It is helpful when dealing with stressful situations, ensuring alertness and preparation. But for some people the symptoms are difficult or impossible to handle, making it impossible to focus on tests.\n\nTest anxiety consists of:\n\n\nResearch shows that parental pressure is associated with greater worry, test irrelevant thoughts, and stronger bodily symptoms relating to anxiety during a test.\n\nOther causes of test anxiety may include fear of failure, procrastination, and previous poor test performance. As well, characteristics of the test environment such as: nature of the task, difficulty, atmosphere, time constraints, examiner characteristics, mode of administration and physical setting can affect the level of anxiousness felt by the student. Researchers Putwain & Best (2011), examined test performance among elementary children when the teacher put pressure on the students in an attempt to create a more high stress environment. Their findings showed that students performed worse in high threat situations and experienced more test anxiety and worrisome thoughts than when in a low threat environment.\n\nTest anxiety is known to develop into a vicious cycle. After experiencing test anxiety on one test, the student may become so fearful of it happening again they become more anxious and upset than they would normally, or even than they experienced on the previous test. If the cycle continues without acknowledgement, or the student seeking help, the student may begin to feel helpless in the situation.\n\nPeople who experience test anxiety often have parents or siblings who have test anxiety or other types of anxiety. Anxiety does seem to have some genetic components.\n\nBiological causes:\n\n      During times of stress the body releases a hormone called adrenaline that helps prepare for what is about to happen. Generally this adrenaline discharge is a good thing, but in some people the symptoms of nerves can be so strong that it does not allow them to concentrate on the tests.\n\nMental causes\n\n      In addition to the biological causes are the mental causes, one of the most influential is the students' expectations, if the student goes to the exam with the mentality that it will go wrong, is much more likely to feel anxiety before and during the exam which will lead to poor performance in the tests.\n\nTest anxiety can be diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV, under the classification of \"social phobia.\"\nSocial phobias are characterized by \"a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur\". In order to be diagnosed as suffering from a social phobia, the DSM-IV states that the individual must present four different factors.\n\n\nOther variables related to test anxiety are:\n\n\nAnxiety is defined as the \"psychological mechanism whereby the current intensification of a dangerous drive results in the elicitation of defenses.\" George Mandler and Seymour Sarason (1952), developed the theory that anxiety present in testing situations is an important determinate of test performance. Individuals that become highly anxious during tests typically perform more poorly on tests than low-test anxious persons, especially when tests are given under stressful evaluative conditions such as a post-secondary exam. The feelings of forgetfulness, or drawing a \"blank\" are developed because of anxiety-produced interference between relevant responses and irrelevant responses generated from the person’s anxious state. The difference in performance of a high-anxious test taker compared to a low-anxious test taker is largely due to the difference in their ability to focus on the tasks required. A low-anxious test taker is able to focus greater attention on the tasks required of them while taking the test, while a high-anxious test taker is focused on their internal self, and the anxiety they are feeling. Anxious test takers do not perform adequately on the test as their attention is divided between themselves and the test. Therefore, students with high test anxiety are unable to focus their full attention on the test. Furthermore, anxiousness is evoked when a student believes that the evaluative situation, such as an assessment, exceeds his or her intellectual, motivational, and social capabilities.\n\nPsychologists Liebert and Morris (1967) analyzed the structure of test anxiety given on two distinct factors: \"Cognitive Test Anxiety\" and \"Emotionality\". Emotionality means that the individual shows high levels of several different symptoms related to test anxiety that can be seen through physiological responses experienced during situations where they are being evaluated; such as an exam. Some of the physiological manifestations include: increased galvanic skin response and heart rate, dizziness, nausea, or feelings of panic. There is evidence that emotionality is a distinct part of test anxiety; however, it can be seen that when an individual displays high emotionality it means that it is mostly associated with declining performance, but only when the individual is also experiencing high levels of worry.\n\nThe other factor mentioned is Cognitive Test Anxiety, also known as worry. It is mostly composed of the individuals cognitive reactions to situations where they are being evaluated, in the times prior to, during, and after those tasks. Some of the thoughts that individuals with high cognitive test anxiety are constantly dealing with are comparing self performance to peers, considering the consequences of failure, low levels of confidence in performance, excessive worry about grades, feeling that they are unprepared for tests, and loss of self-worth.\n\nResearchers Putwain, Woods & Symes (2010), found that a low academic self-concept was associated with higher worry and tension about their abilities to do well on a test. A student's metacognitive beliefs play an important role in the maintenance of negative self-beliefs.\n\nAnxiety reactions can be generalized from previous experiences to testing situations. Feelings of inadequacy, helplessness, anticipations of punishment or loss of status and esteem manifest anxiety responses. As well, the presence of an audience can debilitate the performance of high anxious test takers and increase the performance of low anxious test takers. Persons who score high on anxiety scales tend to describe themselves in negative, self-devaluing terms. Highly anxious test takers also blame themselves for their failure significantly more than low anxious test takers.\n\nThe study of the relationship between anxiety and performance can be understood by using the Yerkes-Dodson Law, where one can see the facilitating and debilitating effects of arousal on performance as an inverted \"U\". \nAn example of this correlation can be seen in terms of a child taking a test where the degree of arousal or anxiety that the child portrays can be seen as beneficial to the performance. Though, if the child doesn't have a feeling or fear or failure or some sort of encouragement to perform well on the test, then the child is unlikely to put the necessary effort into preparing or being motivated when taking the test and so he or she will not perform to their fullest potential.\n\nHowever, if before or during a test a child's level of anxiety is above the optimum level, they may also fail to demonstrate their true abilities. Under these circumstances fear of the actual test may disrupt preparation and cause a great amount of distress during the test that it is more than likely to impair their performance.\n\nThere are two main groups of attentional theories that attempt to explain compromised performance in pressured situations.\n\nOne group of theories are the \"explicit monitoring theories\". They state that when a person is expected to perform a specific skill, the pressure may cause an increased self-consciousness and inward focus, which can disrupt their ability to successfully perform that task. Thinking about step-by-step procedures can inhibit one’s ability to execute a task. For example, a study by R. Gray found that baseball players put into the high-pressure condition had increased errors, and an increased ability to recall details like the direction their bat was moving. This indicates that the pressured players were monitoring themselves more, which impacted their ability to successfully hit the ball.\n\nA second group of theories are the \"distraction theories\". These theories states that high-pressure environments create a dual-task situation, in which the person’s attention is divided between the task at hand and unhelpful thoughts about the situation and possible negative consequences of poor performance. \nAttention is an important part of working memory, which is the system that actively holds several pieces of relevant information in the mind while inhibiting irrelevant information. Working memory has a limited capacity, and the addition of stress and anxiety reduces the resources available to focus on relevant information.\n\nIn situations in which individuals need to concentrate their attention on a specific task, emotional stimuli can divert their attention to a greater degree than non-emotional stimuli. Emotional stimuli will often dominate a person’s thoughts, and any attempt to suppress them will require additional working memory resources. When working memory divides resources between the aversive cognitions and the task-relevant material, then the person’s ability to use the relevant information on a test will suffer.People who suffer from test anxiety are more likely to experience negative cognitions while in evaluative situations. Furthermore, test anxious persons have been found to bias their attention towards threatening and anxiety related stimuli more than nonemotional stimuli.Research has accordingly found that tasks that rely heavily on working memory are the ones that suffer the most during pressure. Shortfalls in performance that are caused by test anxiety seem to be related to the extent to which the student has full access to their working memory.\n\nWhen comparing these two theories in the context of academic performance, a majority of work supports distraction theories. One reason for this is that many of the skills performed in the classroom require heavy demands on working memory. However, there are different kinds of pressure situations. There is \"monitoring pressure\", in which an individual’s performance is impacted due to the presence of an audience, and \"outcome pressure\", in which an individual’s performance is influenced by the consequences of the testing results. In a study, DeCaro \"et al.\" found that performance on a rule-based task, that relies heavily on working memory, was impaired by outcome pressure, but not monitoring pressure, whereas performance on an information-integration task, which does not require attentional control, was hurt by monitoring pressure, but not outcome pressure. These findings indicate that performance is compromised in different ways depending on the type of task, and the types of pressure, and that both theories can be correct.\n\nEysenck \"et al.\" elaborate upon the distraction theories and propose the attentional control theory. This theory uses Baddeley's model of working memory to explain the effects of anxiety on working memory and on performance. In Baddeley's theory, working memory (WM) consists of four components, one of them the central executive that has a number of tasks such as coordination of the temporary stores of phonological and visual information (phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad, respectively).\n\nThe attentional control theory assumes that anxiety primarily affects attentional control, which is a key function of the central executive. Attentional control is the balance between the two attentional systems, the \"goal-directed system\", influenced by the individual's goals, and the \"stimulus-driven system\", influenced by salient stimuli. According to the attentional control theory, anxiety disrupts the balance between these two systems. The stimulus-driven system becomes stronger at the expense of the goal-directed system, thereby impairing the efficiency of the inhibition and shifting functions of the central executive.\n\nIn support of this theory, there is strong evidence that anxiety largely impairs processing efficiency rather than performance effectiveness. Performance effectiveness refers to the quality of performance whereas processing efficiency refers to the amount of resources used to attain an effective performance. There is also evidence that anxiety impairs both the inhibition and the shifting function. Therefore, this theory suggests that students high in test anxiety will have to allocate more resources to the task at hand than non-test anxiety students in order to achieve the same results.\n\nIn general, people with higher working memory capacity do better on academic tasks, but this changes when people are under acute pressure. Sian Beilock \"et al.\" found that pressure led individuals with a high working memory capacity to perform worse on a complicated task, whereas individuals with a low WM capacity got the same low results with or without pressure. This was because people with high WM could use more better but more demanding problem solving strategies in the low pressure condition, which they had to abandon in the high pressure condition. The low WM people never used these demanding strategies in the first place. Evidence for similar working memory effects in children has also been found. Evidence that trait anxiety might have different effects on working memory than state or acute pressure situations comes from Johnson \"et al.\" who found individuals' performances on a task showed a decrease in accuracy due to trait anxiety for individuals with low or average WM capacity, but did not significantly decrease for individuals with high WM.\n\nEarly scales, by authors such as Charles Spielberger, tended to focus on physiological and somatic features and on worry, commonly referred to as \"emotionality\", while more recent offerings, such as that by Cassady & Johnson, emphasize cognitive processes. \"Test anxiety\" for these authors consists of physiological and mental processes, and impaired test performance is seen as the result.\n\nThe \"Children's Test Anxiety Questionnaire\" is specifically designed to measure test anxiety in children 8–12 years of age. It provides scores for three dimensions of test anxiety: \"worrisome thoughts concerning failure (i.e. 'when I take tests, I worry about failing'), automatic reactions concerning students' general and specific somatic indications of anxiety (i.e. 'when I take tests, my heart beats fast'), and off-task behaviours concerning nervous habits and distracting behaviours (i.e. 'when I take tests, I play with my pencil')\" \n\nThe \"Test Anxiety Inventory for Children and Adolescent\" (TAICA) is a way to measure and assess test anxiety in children and adolescents in Grades 4 through 12. Those individuals who are being assessed rate their responses on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (never true about me) to 5 (always true about me). The TAICA is a 45-item self-report measure which consists of four sub scales.\n\n\nMedication is not recommended to treat test anxiety; instead, standard suggestions include sleep, proper nutrition, exercise, meditation, studying without stress, and enacting habits to reduce stress during the test. \n\nTo gain an accurate assessment of student comprehension, instructors should be concerned with minimizing the effects of test anxiety. Instructors might offer \"second chances\" post test, familiarize students with test format and grading scheme, and lower the impact of any one test. If students have greater confidence in their test-taking skills, they are more likely to be comfortable and relaxed when the testing does occur. Having an intentional thinking strategy should help student performance improve.\n\nFor some individuals, poor academic performance is due to skill deficits, which could include problems in encoding (learning),rehearsal (study skills) or retrieval during a test (test-taking strategies). Skill deficits may lead to poor performance directly (failure to adequately learn the material) or indirectly (awareness of being ill-prepared causes anxiety that, in turn, leads to poor performance). Therefore, the most effective interventions are those that combine skill-focused strategies (i.e. study skills training, test-taking skills) with cognitive (i.e. cognitive restructuring) or behavioural approaches (i.e. relaxation training, systematic desensitization). \n\nStudents also need to stay healthy in order to be able to deal with stress and anxiety. They need to eat healthy, and get enough sleep. \n\n"}

{"id": "244752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244752", "title": "Waking Life", "text": "Waking Life\n\nWaking Life is a 2001 American adult animated docufiction film, directed by Richard Linklater. The film explores a wide range of philosophical issues including the nature of reality, dreams, consciousness, the meaning of life, free will, and existentialism. \"Waking Life\" is centered on a young man who wanders through a succession of dream-like realities wherein he encounters a series of individuals who engage in insightful philosophical discussions.\n\nThe film was entirely rotoscoped, although it was shot using digital video of live actors with a team of artists drawing stylized lines and colors over each frame with computers, rather than being filmed and traced onto cels on a lightbox. The film contains several parallels to Linklater's 1991 film \"Slacker\". Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy reprise their characters from \"Before Sunrise\" in one scene. \"Waking Life\" premiered at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nAn unnamed young man living an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and eventually progresses toward an existential crisis. He observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other characters—ranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant-goers and friends—about such issues as metaphysics, free will, social philosophy, and the meaning of life. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence, but rather, focus on a random isolated person, group of people, or couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film touches also upon existentialism, situationist politics, posthumanity, the film theory of André Bazin, and lucid dreaming, and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name.\n\nGradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional false awakenings. So far he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterwards, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream.\n\nThe protagonist's final talk is with a character whom he briefly encountered previously, earlier in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's understanding that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become one with the universe; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only to accept God's invitation.\n\nThe protagonist is last seen walking into a driveway when he suddenly begins to levitate, paralleling a scene at the start of the film of a floating child in the same driveway. The protagonist uncertainly reaches toward the car's handle, but is too swiftly lifted above the vehicle and over the trees. He rises into the endless blue expanse of the sky until he disappears from view.\n\n\nThe film features appearances from a wide range of actors and non-actors, including:\n\nIn a 2001 interview Linklater estimated that the idea for the film came \"before I was even interested in film, probably 20 years ago\". Despite the long gestation process in his head, Linklater noted that before he came up with the idea of rotoscoping, the film \"didn't quite work\" calling it \"too blunt, too realistic\" stating that \"I think to make a realistic film about an unreality the film had to be a realistic unreality\".\n\nAdding to the dream-like effect, the film used an animation technique based on rotoscoping. Animators overlaid live action footage (shot by Linklater) with animation that roughly approximates the images actually filmed. This technique is similar in some respects to the rotoscope style of 1970s filmmaker Ralph Bakshi. Rotoscoping itself, however, was not Bakshi's invention, but that of experimental silent film maker Max Fleischer, who patented the process in 1917. A variety of artists were employed, so the feel of the movie continually changes, and gets stranger as time goes on. The result is a surreal, shifting dreamscape.\n\nThe animators used expensive \"off-the-shelf\" Apple Macintosh computers. The film was mostly produced using Rotoshop, a custom-made rotoscoping program that creates blends between keyframe vector shapes, which also makes use of virtual \"layers\", and created specifically for the production by Bob Sabiston. Linklater used this animation method again for his 2006 film \"A Scanner Darkly\".\n\n\"Waking Life\" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2001, and was given a limited release in the United States on October 19, 2001.\n\nCritical reaction has been mostly positive. It holds a rating of 80% across 137 reviews on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes — with critical consensus that \"the talky, animated \"Waking Life\" is a unique, cerebral experience\" — and an average score of 82/100 (\"universal acclaim\") on Metacritic, based on 31 reviews. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film four stars out of four, describing it as \"a cold shower of bracing, clarifying ideas\". Ebert later included the film on his list of \"Great Movies\". Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" awarded the film an \"A\" rating, calling it \"a work of cinematic art in which form and structure pursues the logic-defying (parallel) subjects of dreaming and moviegoing,\" while Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" said it was \"so verbally dexterous and visually innovative that you can't absorb it unless you have all your wits about you\". Dave Kehr of \"The New York Times\" found the film to be \"lovely, fluid, funny\" and stated that it \"never feels heavy or over-ambitious\".\n\nConversely, J. Hoberman of \"The Village Voice\" felt that \"Waking Life\" \"doesn't leave you in a dream ... so much as it traps you in an endless bull session\". Frank Lovece felt the film was \"beautifully drawn\" but called its content \"pedantic navel-gazing\".\n\nNominated for numerous awards, mainly for its technical achievements, \"Waking Life\" won the National Society of Film Critics award for \"Best Experimental Film\", the New York Film Critics Circle award for \"Best Animated Film\", and the \"CinemAvvenire\" award at the Venice Film Festival for \"Best Film\". It was also nominated for the Golden Lion, the festival's main award.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nThe film was released on DVD in North America in May 2002. Special features included several commentaries, documentaries, interviews, trailers, and deleted scenes, as well as the short film \"Snack and Drink\". A bare-bones DVD with no special features was released in Region 2 in February 2003.\n\nThe \"Waking Life OST\" was performed and written by Glover Gill and the Tosca Tango Orchestra, except for Frédéric Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2. The soundtrack was relatively successful. Featuring the nuevo tango style, it bills itself \"the 21st Century Tango\". The tango contributions were influenced by the music of the Argentine \"father of new tango\" Ástor Piazzolla.\n\n\n\n"}

The term is synonymous with and . The term most often refers to the guild names of kabuki actors, but is also applicable to the names artists take from their masters or studios, names taken from one's business, and a few other similar circumstances.\n\nThe \"ya\" (屋) of \"yagō\", also often seen at the end of a \"yagō\" name, means \"house\", \"roof\", or \"shop\", and helps to illuminate the origins and meanings of the term. A number of \"yagō\" have associated mon emblems, some of which incorporate rebuses; see Japanese rebus monogram.\n\nOriginally, \"yagō\" were place names of homes or buildings taken on by the inhabitants. Even when the house changed hands entirely from one family to another, the new family would take on the name of the house. However, the previous owners would frequently keep the house name when they moved. Often, a family (or individual) would come to be better known by their \"yagō\" than by their actual family name.\n\nThough it is not clear when the custom first emerged, it first appears in print in the chronicles of the Muromachi period. For many centuries, commoners in Japan did not have family names, and so \"yagō\" would often come about to describe people by their location, occupation, or by a store or business they owned. There are similarities in the origins and evolution of family names in other cultures around the world.\n\n\"Yagō\" also came to be used to help differentiate the status of lineages with the same last name, or simply to differentiate between people with the same family name within a village. Houses might come to be known simply by their location, such as in a or at the , and families took on these place-names. \"Yagō\" could also be used to denote the main and branch lines of a family.\n\n\"Yagō\" came to be especially well-known and widely used in kabuki theater, where actors take on a name relating to their guild. The famous actor Ichikawa Danjūrō V, though he was from the Ichikawa family, was also known by the \"yagō\" of Naritaya (Narita house), which indicates his guild within the Kabuki world. This therefore connects him to others of the Naritaya, and reflects his apprenticeship and study alongside certain other actors who might be from other families. Actors' \"yagō\" were often chosen to recall earlier great actors, and it remains a common practice (called \"kakegoe\") for audience members to shout out an actor's \"yagō\" when he performed a line or pose particularly well-executed, especially a pose or line associated with the actor's namesake.\n\nArtists, writers and poets in Japan, like in other parts of the world, would often take on pen names or pseudonyms. These were sometimes derived from the names of their mentors (particularly in painting studios), in which case they could be considered \"yagō\". But more often these art-names or pen names are called in Japanese or simply \"gō\" (号).\n\nDuring the Edo period, merchant houses took \"yagō\", which functioned as surnames. Patterns include the name of a province + \"ya\" such as Kagaya and Echigoya, and an indicator of occupation such as Minatoya (\"minato\", meaning \"harbor\", indicating someone in shipping or trade). Some of these survive as surnames today.\n\n (1985). \"Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan\". Tokyo: Kodansha Ltd.\n"}

Zhiren Cave is an early Late Pleistocene site that has yielded the fossil remains of possibly anatomically modern humans with some mixed archaic human features.\n\nThe fossil remains were discovered by Chinese paleontologists in 2007. The fossils were covered by a continuous layer of flowstone, a layer that was initially dated to around 113,000 to 100,000 BP. A more thorough re-dating was later undertaken, and gives an estimated date of around 116,000 to 106,000 BP.\n\nSome of the large mammal remains discovered at Zhiren Cave include those from \"Pongo pygmaeus\", \"Elephas kiangnanensis\", \"Elephas maximus\", \"Megatapirus augustus\", \"Rhinoceros sinensis\", \"Megalovis guangxiensis\", Cervus unicolor, \"Ursus thibetanus\", \"Arctonyx collaris\" and \"Panthera pardus\". Around 25% of the large mammal species discovered at the site are now extinct.\n\nThree pieces of hominin remains were identified: two upper molars (\"Zhiren 1\" and \"Zhiren 2\") and an anterior mandible (\"Zhiren 3\"). The fossils are believed to have belonged to at least two different individuals, as \"Zhiren 1\" and \"Zhiren 3\" are unlikely to have come from the same individual.\n\nWhen compared to Late Pleistocene fossils from western Eurasia, \"Zhiren 1\" and \"Zhiren 2\" are smaller and would be classified as modern; however, the comparative context is lacking in East Asian Late Pleistocene fossils. Zhiren 2 shows evidence for dental winging in its lower incisors, a feature that has only been found in \"Homo sapiens\".\n\n\"Zhiren 3\" contains a mix of archaic and modern human features. The most significant aspect of \"Zhiren 3\" is that it has a distinctively modern human chin. Coupled with the dating, \"Zhiren 3\" could possibly represent the earliest modern human fossil in East Asian. However, many were skeptical of this conclusion, since this would significantly push back the general consensus on the dating of human migration out of Africa. Peter Bellwood also cites the lack of archaeological finds associated with the fossils.\n\n\n"}
