He lived in Utrecht and already in 1570 held an influential position under the employment of stadtholder Adolf van Nieuwenaar. He married Susanna Patersson, with whom he had three children in the 1580s. In 1595 he moved to Delft where he remained until his death on 11 October 1608 and where he was buried in the Oude Kerk.

It was established in 1997 in terms of the KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act of that year and is an agency of the Office of the Premier of the government of the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa. It is also a 'public entity' under the terms of the Public Finance Management Act. It is mandated to care for that part of South Africa's national estate that is of provincial and local significance in KwaZulu-Natal .\n\nAmafa is the oldest heritage resources authority in South Africa, all others being established in terms of the National Heritage Resources Act of 1999 or, in the Northern Cape, under provincial legislation that post dates the KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act of 1997.\n\nAmafa is best known as the custodian of approximately 300 Provincial Landmarks and Heritage Landmarks in the province, and several sites at which it manages interpretative centres.\n\nAmafa is the successor body to the National Monuments Council in the former Natal Province and KwaZulu Monuments Council in the former KwaZulu Bantustan or homeland, in South Africa. Under the 1996 Constitution of South Africa, cultural matters are a competency shared between national and provincial government. This necessitated the creation of a system whereby many of the responsibilities of former monuments authorities were devolved to provincial level via the National Heritage Resources Act.\n\nProvinces may pass their own heritage resources legislation and KwaZulu-Natal is one of only two that has chosen that route rather than to use provisions of the National Heritage Resources Act to establish a provincial heritage resources authority (PHRA). Part of the reason for this is that the first KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act (1997) predates the National Heritage Resources Act (1999) and that there was no national framework for heritage at the time that the province resolved to establish its PHRA. The 1997 Act was replaced in 2008 by a new act of the same name.\n\nThe Logo of the organisation is the one formerly used by the KwaZulu Monuments Council.\n\n\n\nAmafa is subject to a biennial assessment of competency by the South African Heritage Resources Agency, SAHRA in terms of the National Heritage Resources Act. This process determines which aspects of the national estate it is qualified to implement. It has been assessed as competent to deal with all areas over which a provincial heritage resources authority is permitted to act.\n\nIn terms of the KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act Amafa is responsible for a range of heritage resources.\n\nAmafa inherited responsibility for former national monuments and KwaZulu monuments in the province. These are now known as 'Specially Protected Heritage Resources' and are Provincial Landmarks, if state owned, or Heritage Landmarks, if privately owned. These terms equate with the term provincial heritage site used by the National Heritage Resources Act and hence all other provincial heritage resources authorities in South Africa. At present there are around 300 such sites in the province .\n\nMost specially protected sites must be declared by publication of a notice in the Provincial Gazette, but graves of members of the Zulu royal family, and battlefields and public monuments and memorials listed in the Schedule to the KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act are automatically protected in the same way as a Heritage Landmark.\n\nThe organisation continues to declare new sites on a regular basis.\n\nThe following are protected without the need to be specifically identified and declared in terms of the Act.\n\nAmafa may also protect moveable heritage as Heritage Objects by publication of a notice in the Provincial Gazette\n\nAmafa is unique amongst provincial heritage resources authorities in South Africa in that it also runs a museum and several interpretive centres at sites which it manages: .\n\n\nAmafa is governed by a Council appointed by the Member of the Executive Council of the Province responsible for its functions. Presently that is the provincial Premier. It is appointed for a three-year term of office. . \n\nThe Council has established a number of committees which meet regularly to implement the responsibilities of the organisation. These include the following: .\n\n\nAmafa employs a staff complement of around 100. They are under the authority of the Chief Executive Officer. .\n\nAmafa receives an annual transfer payment from the KwaZulu-Natal Premier's Department. This, together with earnings from application fees and income generated by the sites which it manages, covers its operational costs.\n\nAmafa has offices at the KwaZulu Cultural Museum, King Cetshwayo Highway, Ondini, Ulundi (28.19.11.33S 31.27.33.75E) and the Old YMCA Building, Cnr Langalibalele and Buchanan Streets, Pietermaritzburg (29.36.16.46S 30.22.39.42.E)\n\n\n\n\nProvincial Heritage Resources Authorities: \n"}

It is based in Washington, D.C., United States. CLIR is supported primarily by annual dues from its 183 sponsoring institutions and 156 DLF members, and by foundation grants and individual donations.\n\nCLIR is overseen by a 21-member board of directors.\n\nThrough its work, CLIR aims to cultivate cross-disciplinary intellectual leadership, create professional development opportunities, and promote best practices for the preservation, organization, and accessibility of information. The following are among CLIR's major programs.\n\nThe Digital Library Federation (DLF) is a community of practitioners who advance research, learning, social justice, and the public good through the creative design and wise application of digital library technologies. It is the place where CLIR's broader information-community strategies are informed and enriched by digital library practice. DLF is led by Bethany Nowviskie and is guided by the DLF Advisory Committee, which includes five members of CLIR's board of directors.\n\nDigitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives is a national competition for digitizing collections of rare and unique content in cultural memory institutions. Last year, CLIR awarded nearly $4 million to institutions holding collections of high scholarly value.The program is supported by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nCLIR Postdoctoral Fellows work on projects that forge and strengthen connections among library collections, educational technologies, and current research. The program offers recent PhD graduates the chance to help develop research tools, resources, and services while exploring new career opportunities. Host institutions benefit from fellows' field-specific expertise by gaining insights into their collections' potential uses and users, scholarly information behaviors, and current teaching and learning practices within particular disciplines.\n\nCLIR offers about 15 fellowships annually to support original-source doctoral dissertation research in the humanities or related social sciences.\n\nIn partnership with EDUCAUSE, CLIR organizes the annual Leading Change Institute (LCI). LCI aims to prepare and develop the next generation of leaders in libraries, information services, and higher education by engaging those who seek to further develop their skills for the benefit of higher education.\n\nThe Committee on Coherence at Scale for Higher Education was formed in 2012 to examine emerging national-scale digital projects and their potential to help transform higher education in terms of scholarly productivity, teaching, cost-efficiency, and sustainability. Committee members include college and university presidents and provosts, deans, university librarians, and association heads.\n\nCLIR produces a variety of print and web-based publications, most notably the Burgundy Reports, which are substantive reports on topics relating to digital libraries, economics of information, long-term access to information, and the future of the library and its leadership. CLIR publications also include \"CLIR Issues,\"https://www.clir.org/pubs/issues a bimonthly newsletter covering topics related to CLIR’s agenda; and the blog Re: Thinking. The full text of most CLIR publications is available on the CLIR website.\n\nCLIR resulted from the merger of the Commission on Preservation and Access (CPA) and the Council on Library Resources (CLR) in 1997. Planning for the merger began in 1995, with the appointment of Deanna B. Marcum as the president of both organizations by their respective boards. Following the merger, Marcum served as president of CLIR until 2003. She was succeeded by Richard Detweiler, who served as interim director until the appointment of Nancy Davenport in June 2004. Davenport left CLIR in 2006 and was succeeded by Charles Henry.\n\nEstablished in 1956 with a $5 million grant from the Ford Foundation, the Council on Library Resources (CLR) was an independent coordinating body that aimed to address common problems faced by libraries in an era of explosive library growth and the emergence of new technologies. Louis B. Wright, the director of the Folger Shakespeare Library, was a principal figure in the organization's founding. Verner Clapp, then the Deputy Librarian of Congress, was named the first president, and served until 1967.\n\nCLR subsequently received further grants from the Ford Foundation, amounting to $31.5 million by 1983; and, beginning in 1978, also received funding from a variety of other sources, including the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Pew Memorial Trust. CLR's own grant-making activities focused on increasing library cooperation, supporting the application of technological developments to library needs, and conducting research on library problems. It funded programs to improve nationwide bibliographic access and services, to support collection development, and to develop strategies for the preservation of library materials.\n\nThe Commission on Preservation and Access (CPA) was established as a permanent body in 1986. It had its beginnings in the work of a task force on preservation and access that was one of several task forces formed jointly by the Association of American Universities and the Council on Library Resources, under the leadership of CLR president Warren J. Haas, who took office in 1978. Haas, who had previously headed the Columbia University Libraries, was particularly attuned to the problem of the deteriorating condition of books and journals in library collections, and, in 1972, in response to failed efforts of the Association of Research Libraries to formulate a plan for collective action, had articulated recommendations for a national preservation program.\n\nHaas served as interim chair of the newly formed Commission, until the appointment of Patricia Battin as its first president in August 1987.\n\nA group of librarians working on projects to test the feasibility of using digital technology for preservation urged CPA to coordinate activities of a small but growing group of libraries that shared digital interests. The Digital Library Federation (DLF) grew out of informal discussions among eight librarians (the LaGuardia Eight, named after the meeting site at LaGuardia Airport). The group soon comprised 12 institutions that were committed to looking at the broader implications of digital technology. In 1994, the group called for a planning strategy for the development of digital libraries and began to organize themselves to continue local efforts while also sharing their findings.\n\nAt about the same time, LC announced its intention to create a national digital library. To ensure that their activities would be compatible with those of LC, the consortium asked LC and the National Archives to join in a new effort—the National Digital Library Federation. The CPA continued to serve as the administrative home for the group, whose name was soon shortened to Digital Library Federation.\n\n\n"}

Elsewhere, Heather, a stripper, is shown living with her girlfriend Victoria, a controlling and drug-addicted single mother, who she is cheating on with a co-worker named Bunny. Dreaming of running away to Greece together, Heather and Bunny agree to do a drug run for their abusive boss, intent on stealing the money they get for the delivery.\n\nAnton, the pimp who ordered the cocaine, lives on the top floor of an abandoned nightclub, which he brings two prostitutes to. Cross Bearer follows the three up to Anton's room, murders them with his hammer, and takes Anton's gun. Heather, Bunny, Victoria, another stripper named Cindy, and Cindy's boyfriend Mark, an amateur filmmaker and pornographer, arrive, and are let in by Cross Bearer. The quintet finds Anton's remains, and are confronted by Cross Bearer, who shoots and beats Mark, and kills Cindy by emptying a bag of cocaine on her face.\n\nVictoria goes to look for a way out on her own, and is chased to a dead end, where Cross Bearer bludgeons her, and rips her tongue out. Heather and Bunny become separated, and the latter is murdered. Cross Bearer goes after Heather, but is distracted by Mark, who shoots him with Anton's gun. After dealing with Mark, Cross Bearer pursues Heather, and the two fight, with Heather emerging victorious, pulling off Cross Bearer's mask, and pummeling him with a baseball bat. While looking for an exit, Heather finds the dying Mark, who gives her Anton's hidden stash of money.\n\nIn the morning, Heather goes to her workplace, gives a nihilistic speech, and shoots both her boss, and a man who had heckled her the previous day. Heather then goes to a train station with Victoria's baby, while back at the derelict nightclub, Cross Bearer recovers, and stumbles away while muttering, \"Oh, loving Lord, guide my hand, so I may purify this Earthly paradise for your great return\".\n\n\n\"1nflux Magazine's\" Rob Rector gave \"Cross Bearer\" a B, and opened his review with, \"There are many things you can overlook as a film reviewer if you know the people behind the camera have a clue. Such is the case for \"Cross Bearer\", a seedy little indie horror flick that may have several shortcomings, but all which can be overlooked by the fact that you can feel the appreciation of the horror and grindhouse genres the film so skillfully captures\". A 4/5 was awarded by Matt Boiselle of Dread Central, who praised the film's gore and killer, and wrote, \"Ahlbrandt delivers on all fronts when it comes to not only delivering a storyline that hooks the audience, but providing a varied assortment of characters that we cannot wait to watch act out their most destructive vices\". Horror News also responded well to the film, opining that, \"\"Cross Bearer\" has a lot of violence, sex, and nudity but still done under the microscope of a professional operation that knows how to make use of their budgets\" and \"At the end of the day, \"Cross Bearer\" is a dirty little film that is well shot and well presented. It looks good and keeps the action moving treating us to quite a few stripper moments to keep things lively\". Patrick Dolan of \"Rue Morgue\" gave the film a positive review, only criticizing the acting and \"scatterbrained\" structure. In a review for \"Film Threat\", Mike Watt stated, \"I wasn't in that much of a hurry to see yet another low-budget slasher film, but \"Cross Bearer\" contains enough pitch-black moments that it rises above the majority of the mediocre movies sharing the subgenre that we've all endured over the years. Apart from a few padded sections of gleeful debauchery, \"Cross Bearer's\" tone is very bleak and the performances very realistic\".\n"}

He describes the expression as the \"phenomenon of partial socialization in adults born from bi-cultural/national unions and whose childhood was characterized by nomadic displacement during key personality developmental stages\". \"Jet\" symbolically designates international travel as the cause, \"cultural lag\" the resulting disconnect observed in these patients.\n\nOriginally the author used the expressions \"social jet lag\" and \"cultural jet lag\" interchangeably, however the expression \"social jet lag\" has since more widely become associated with an unrelated delayed sleep phase syndrome and cultural jet lag has therefore become the conventional term. Cultural jet lag is sometimes just referred to by its initials: CJL. During some of the presentations of his research, Marc Perraud also coined the term \"cultural schizophrenia\" to explain the elements of confusion in children constantly exposed to changing cultural and moral environments. This expression is to be seen only as an attempt at vulgarization using popular imagery and does not refer to the actual accepted psychological definition, diagnosis or symptoms of clinical schizophrenia. \n\nIncidentally, the expression cultural jet lag was also used in the 1980s as a title for a comic strip , that focused on providing social commentary in the United States (featured in the \"Humor Times\"). This title reflects the notions of distance between the author and the subject of his cultural satire but does not reflect the literal and total connotations of the definition cited prior. (disambiguation)\n\nCultural jet lag refers to the feeling of disconnect that Third Culture Kids (TCKs), as they have now become known, experience in relation to any culture, including the ones from which they stem. This disconnect, also present in Adult Third Culture Kids (ATCKs), applies to all the cultures to which they are/were exposed, whether it be their parents' cultures or those to which they were exposed during their upbringing through international travel.\n\nThird Culture Kids, those that were brought between countries, and in a bi-cultural environment, also referred to as global nomads, typically experience varying degrees of cultural jet lag. While they exhibit high levels of cross-cultural competence (3C)—in that they are in tune with the different cultures between which they grew up, sometimes illustrating more astute understanding than mono-cultured counterparts because of their multiple referential points—they generally have the feeling that they remain outside the culture, looking in. They do not experience the same drives, desires and constraints as other non-TCK members of their cultures and feel like constant spectators to any visceral dynamic (patriotism, identification, national pride, duty, allegiance, sports fan, political involvement etc.)\n\nCultural jet lag drives a disconnect that can have varying levels of sociability impact on the TCK depending on their character and their support structures (friends and family in particular). Research done at scenyc , a company that regroups one of the largest concentration of TCKs (90% of employees), has shown that:\n\nCultural jet lag is sometimes confused with several apparently close but dissimilar cross-cultural phenomena:\n\nSome high level research has been done on the Third Culture Kids . However this research has primarily described attributes, anecdotes and summarized basic behavioral/sociological observations. While the serious study of the psychological mechanisms and impacts of cultural jet lag is still in its infancy, it has been brought to the forefront because of the impact globalization has had on the number of children and future adults that will experience CJL.\n\nResearch currently underway is testing the postulate that cultural jet lag stems from an atypical crystallization of the super-ego during the child developmental phases. While typical children inherit morals and values first from their parents and then from their environments in a second stage, culturally jet lagged children, devoid of a single moral and cultural referential in their environment, later develop an overstated role of id in their ego balance (referring to Freudian theory).\n\nStatistical research is also underway to identify the psychological impacts of CJL, in particular the:\n"}
{"id": "1543682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1543682", "title": "DC One Million", "text": "DC One Million\n\nDC One Million is a comic book crossover storyline that ran through a self-titled, weekly miniseries and through special issues of almost all of the \"DCU\" titles published by American company DC Comics in November 1998. It featured a vision of the DC Universe in the 853rd century (85,201–85,300 AD), chosen because that is the century in which DC Comics would have published issue #1,000,000 of their comics if they had maintained a regular publishing schedule. The miniseries was written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Val Semeiks.\n\nThe core of the event was a four-issue miniseries, in which the 20th-century Justice League of America and the 853rd-century Justice Legion Alpha cooperate to defeat a plot by the supervillain Vandal Savage (who, being practically immortal, exists in both centuries as well as all the ones in between) and future Superman nemesis Solaris the Living Sun. Thirty-four other series then being published by DC also put out a single issue numbered #1,000,000, which either showed its characters' involvement in the central plot or gave a glimpse of what its characters' descendants/successors would be doing in the 853rd century. \"Hitman\" #1,000,000 was essentially a parody of the entire storyline. A trade paperback collection was subsequently published, consisting of the four-issue mini-series, and tie-in issues necessary to follow the main plot. The series was then followed by a one-shot titled \"DC One Million 80-Page Giant\" #1,000,000 (1999), which was a collection of further adventures in the life of the future heroes.\n\nIn the 853rd century, the original Superman (\"Superman-Prime One Million\") still lives, but has spent over fifteen thousand years in a self-imposed exile in his Fortress of Solitude in the heart of the Sun in order to keep it alive, during which everyone he knew and loved died. One of his descendants is \"Kal Kent\", the Superman of the 853rd century.\n\nThe galaxy is protected by the Justice Legions, which were inspired by the 20th-century Justice League and the 31st-century Legion of Super-Heroes, among others. Justice Legion Alpha, which protects the solar system, includes Kal Kent and future analogues of Wonder Woman, Hourman, Starman, Aquaman, the Flash and Batman. Advanced terraforming processes have made all the Solar System's planets habitable, with the ones most distant from the Sun being warmed by Solaris, a \"star computer\" which was once a villain but was reprogrammed by one of Superman's descendants.\n\nSuperman-Prime announces that he will soon return to humanity and, to celebrate, Justice Legion Alpha travels back in time to the late 20th century to meet Superman's original teammates in the JLA, and bring them and Superman to the future to participate in games and displays of power as part of the celebration.\n\nMeanwhile, in Russia, Vandal Savage single-handedly defeats the Titans (Arsenal, Tempest, Jesse Quick and Supergirl) when they attempt to stop him purchasing nuclear-powered Rocket Red suits. He then launches four Rocket Red suits (with a Titan trapped inside each of the four) in a nuclear strike on Washington D.C., Metropolis, Brussels and Singapore.\n\nUnfortunately one member of the Justice Legion Alpha (the future Starman) has been bribed into betraying his teammates by Solaris, who has returned to its old habits. Before the original heroes can be returned to their own time the future Hourman, an android, collapses and releases a virus programmed by Solaris to attack machines and humans.\n\nThe virus affects the guidance systems of the Rocket Red suits and causes one of them to instead detonate over Montevideo, killing over one million people. Tempest (the Titan inside) had escaped long before the suit exploded by using the ice that formed on the suit at high altitude, although he subsequently blacked out and fell into the sea. The virus also drives humans insane, causing an increase in anger and paranoia worldwide. Believing that this was deliberately planned by the JLA to stop him, Savage launches an all-out war on superhumans using \"blitz engines\" he had created and hidden while allied with Hitler during World War II. The paranoia caused by the virus also leads the Justice Legion Alpha and the contemporary heroes to attack each other, although the Justice Legion Alpha manage to coordinate themselves enough to stop the other Rocket Red suits from hitting their targets.\n\nThe remnants of the JLA that stayed in the present and the Justice Legion Alpha overcome their paranoia when the future Superman and Steel realize the significance of the symbol they both wear; as Huntress had pointed out to Steel earlier, wearing the 'S' means that he has to make the hard choices. The two JLAs are eventually able to stop the virus when it is discovered that it is a complex computer program looking for appropriate hardware. To provide this hardware, the heroes are forced to build the body of Solaris (including in it a DNA sample of Superman's wife Lois Lane) and the virus flees from the Earth to this body, bringing Solaris to life. In a final act of repentance, the future Starman sacrifices himself to banish Solaris from the solar system. The future Superman forces himself through time using confiscated time travel technology he finds in the Watchtower, almost dying in the process due to the drain on his powers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the 853rd century, the original JLA are fighting an alliance between Solaris and Vandal Savage. Savage has found a sample of kryptonite on Mars (where it was left by the future Starman back in the 20th century), which he gives to Solaris. Savage has also hired Walker Gabriel to steal the time travel gauntlets of the 853rd century Flash (John Fox) to ensure the Justice Legion Alpha remains trapped in the past. However, he ultimately double-crosses Gabriel.\n\nSolaris, in a final attack, slaughters thousands of superhumans so that it can fire the kryptonite into the sun and kill Superman-Prime before he emerges. The JLA's Green Lantern — a hero who uses a power that Solaris has never encountered before — causes Solaris to go supernova and he and the 853rd century Superman contain the resulting blast — but not before the kryptonite is released.\n\nThe future Vandal Savage teleports from Mars to Earth using the stolen Time-Gauntlets. It turns out, however, that Walker Gabriel and Mitch Shelley, the Resurrection Man (an immortal who had become Savage's greatest foe through the millennia), had sabotaged the Gauntlets so that Savage, instead of travelling only in space, also travels through time, arriving in Montevideo moments before the nuclear blast he caused centuries earlier, finally bringing his life to an end.\n\nIt is then revealed that a secret conspiracy—forewarned by the trouble in the 20th century, mainly in that Huntress, inspired by the time capsules which students in her class were currently making, realized they had centuries to foil the plot—has spent the intervening centuries coming up with a foolproof plan for stopping Solaris.

{"id": "8886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8886", "title": "Deconstruction", "text": "Deconstruction\n\nDeconstruction is a critique of the relationship between text and meaning originated by the philosopher Jacques Derrida. Derrida's approach consisted in conducting readings of texts with an ear to what runs counter to the intended meaning or structural unity of a particular text. The purpose of deconstruction is to show that the usage of language in a given text, and language as a whole, are irreducibly complex, unstable, or impossible. Throughout his readings, Derrida hoped to show deconstruction at work.\n\nMany debates in continental philosophy surrounding ontology, epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, hermeneutics, and philosophy of language refer to Derrida's observations. Since the 1980s, these observations inspired a range of theoretical enterprises in the humanities, including the disciplines of law anthropology, historiography, linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychoanalysis, LGBT studies, and the feminist school of thought. Deconstruction also inspired deconstructivism in architecture and remains important within art, music, and literary criticism.\n\nWhile common in continental Europe (and wherever Continental philosophy is in the mainstream), deconstruction is not adopted or accepted by most philosophy departments in universities where analytic philosophy is predominant.\n\nJacques Derrida's 1967 book \"Of Grammatology\" introduced the majority of ideas influential within deconstruction. Derrida published a number of other works directly relevant to the concept of deconstruction. Books showing deconstruction in action or defining it more completely include \"Différance\", \"Speech and Phenomena\", and \"Writing and Difference\".\n\nAccording to Derrida and taking inspiration from the work of Ferdinand de Saussure, language as a system of signs and words only has meaning because of the contrast between these signs. As Rorty contends, \"words have meaning only because of contrast-effects with other words...no word can acquire meaning in the way in which philosophers from Aristotle to Bertrand Russell have hoped it might—by being the unmediated expression of something non-linguistic (e.g., an emotion, a sense-datum, a physical object, an idea, a Platonic Form)\". As a consequence, meaning is never present, but rather is deferred to other signs. Derrida refers to the—in this view, mistaken—belief that there is a self-sufficient, non-deferred meaning as metaphysics of presence. A concept, then, must be understood in the context of its opposite, such as being/nothingness, normal/abnormal, speech/writing, etc.\n\nFurther, Derrida contends that \"in a classical philosophical opposition we are not dealing with the peaceful coexistence of a vis-a-vis, but rather with a violent hierarchy. One of the two terms governs the other (axiologically, logically, etc.), or has the upper hand\": signified over signifier; intelligible over sensible; speech over writing; activity over passivity, etc. The first task of deconstruction would be to find and overturn these oppositions inside a text or a corpus of texts; but the final objective of deconstruction is not to surpass all oppositions, because it is assumed they are structurally necessary to produce sense. The oppositions simply cannot be suspended once and for all. The hierarchy of dual oppositions always reestablishes itself. Deconstruction only points to the necessity of an unending analysis that can make explicit the decisions and arbitrary violence intrinsic to all texts.\n\nFinally, Derrida argues that it is not enough to expose and deconstruct the way oppositions work and then stop there in a nihilistic or cynical position, \"thereby preventing any means of intervening in the field effectively\". To be effective, deconstruction needs to create new terms, not to synthesize the concepts in opposition, but to mark their difference and eternal interplay. This explains why Derrida always proposes new terms in his deconstruction, not as a free play but as a pure necessity of analysis, to better mark the intervals. Derrida called undecidables—that is, unities of simulacrum—\"false\" verbal properties (nominal or semantic) that can no longer be included within philosophical (binary) opposition, but which, however, inhabit philosophical oppositions—resisting and organizing it—without ever constituting a third term, without ever leaving room for a solution in the form of Hegelian dialectics (e.g., différance, archi-writing, pharmakon, supplement, hymen, gram, spacing).\n\nDerrida's theories on deconstruction were themselves influenced by the work of linguists such as Ferdinand de Saussure (whose writings on semiotics also became a cornerstone of structuralist theory in the mid-20th century) and literary theorists such as Roland Barthes (whose works were an investigation of the logical ends of structuralist thought). Derrida's views on deconstruction stood in opposition to the theories of structuralists such as psychoanalytic theorist Jacques Lacan, and linguist Claude Lévi-Strauss. However, Derrida resisted attempts to label his work as \"post-structuralist\".\n\nIn order to understand Derrida's motivation, one must refer to Nietzsche's philosophy.\n\nNietzsche's project began with Orpheus, the man underground. This foil to Platonic light was deliberately and self-consciously lauded in \"Daybreak\", when Nietzsche announces, albeit retrospectively, \"In this work you will discover a subterranean man at work\", and then goes on to map the project of unreason: \"All things that live long are gradually so saturated with reason that their origin in unreason thereby becomes improbable. Does not almost every precise history of an origination impress our feelings as paradoxical and wantonly offensive? Does the good historian not, at bottom, constantly contradict?\".\n\nNietzsche's point in \"Daybreak\" is that standing at the end of modern history, modern thinkers know too much to be deceived by the illusion of reason any more. Reason, logic, philosophy and science are no longer solely sufficient as the royal roads to truth. And so Nietzsche decides to throw it in our faces, and uncover the truth of Plato, that he—unlike Orpheus—just happened to discover his true love in the light instead of in the dark. This being merely one historical event amongst many, Nietzsche proposes that we revisualize the history of the West as the history of a series of political moves, that is, a manifestation of the will to power, that at bottom have no greater or lesser claim to truth in any noumenal (absolute) sense. By calling our attention to the fact that he has assumed the role of Orpheus, the man underground, in dialectical opposition to Plato, Nietzsche hopes to sensitize us to the political and cultural context, and the political influences that impact authorship. For example, the political influences that led one author to choose philosophy over poetry (or at least \"portray\" himself as having made such a choice), and another to make a different choice.\n\nThe problem with Nietzsche, as Derrida sees it, is that he did not go far enough. That he missed the fact that this will to power is itself but a manifestation of the operation of writing. And so Derrida wishes to help us step beyond Nietzsche's penultimate revaluation of all western values, to the ultimate, which is the final appreciation of \"the role of writing in the production of knowledge\".\n\nDerrida approaches all texts as constructed around elemental oppositions which all discourse has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This is so because identity is viewed in non-essentialist terms as a construct, and because constructs only produce meaning through the interplay of difference inside a \"system of distinct signs\". This approach to text is influenced by the semiology of Ferdinand de Saussure.\n\nSaussure is considered one of the fathers of structuralism when he explained that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language:\n\nIn language there are only differences. Even more important: a difference generally implies positive terms between which the difference is set up; but in language there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier, language has neither ideas nor sounds that existed before the linguistic system, but only conceptual and phonic differences that have issued from the system. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the other signs that surround it. [...] A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas; but the pairing of a certain number of acoustical signs with as many cuts made from the mass thought engenders a system of values.\n\nSaussure explicitly suggested that linguistics was only a branch of a more general semiology, a science of signs in general, human codes being only one part. Nevertheless, in the end, as Derrida pointed out, Saussure made linguistics \"the regulatory model\", and \"for essential, and essentially metaphysical, reasons had to privilege speech, and everything that links the sign to phone\". Derrida will prefer to follow the more \"fruitful paths (formalization)\" of a general semiotics without falling into what he considered \"a hierarchizing teleology\" privileging linguistics, and to speak of \"mark\" rather than of language, not as something restricted to mankind, but as prelinguistic, as the pure possibility of language, working everywhere there is a relation to something else.\n\nDerrida's original use of the word \"deconstruction\" was a translation of \"Destruktion\", a concept from the work of Martin Heidegger that Derrida sought to apply to textual reading. Heidegger's term referred to a process of exploring the categories and concepts that tradition has imposed on a word, and the history behind them.\n\nDerrida's concerns flow from a consideration of several issues:\n\n\nTo this end, Derrida follows a long line of modern philosophers, who look backwards to Plato and his influence on the Western metaphysical tradition. Like Nietzsche, Derrida suspects Plato of dissimulation in the service of a political project, namely the education, through critical reflections, of a class of citizens more strategically positioned to influence the polis. However, like Nietzsche, Derrida is not satisfied merely with such a political interpretation of Plato, because of the particular dilemma modern humans find themselves in. His Platonic reflections are inseparably part of his critique of modernity, hence the attempt to be something beyond the modern, because of this Nietzschian sense that the modern has lost its way and become mired in nihilism.\n\nDifférance is the observation that the meanings of words come from their synchrony with other words within the language and their diachrony between contemporary and historical definitions of a word. Understanding language, according to Derrida, requires an understanding of both viewpoints of linguistic analysis. The focus on diachrony has led to accusations against Derrida of engaging in the etymological fallacy.\n\nThere is one statement by Derrida—in an essay on Rousseau in \"Of Grammatology\"—which has been of great interest to his opponents. It is the assertion that \"there is no outside-text\" (\"il n'y a pas de hors-texte\"), which is often mistranslated as \"there is nothing outside of the text\". The mistranslation is often used to suggest Derrida believes that nothing exists but words. Michel Foucault, for instance, famously misattributed to Derrida the very different phrase \"Il n'y a rien en dehors du texte\" for this purpose. According to Derrida, his statement simply refers to the unavoidability of context that is at the heart of différance.\n\nFor example, the word \"house\" derives its meaning more as a function of how it differs from \"shed\", \"mansion\", \"hotel\", \"building\", etc. (Form of Content, that Louis Hjelmslev distinguished from Form of Expression) than how the word \"house\" may be tied to a certain image of a traditional house (i.e., the relationship between signified and signifier), with each term being established in reciprocal determination with the other terms than by an ostensive description or definition: when can we talk about a \"house\" or a \"mansion\" or a \"shed\"? The same can be said about verbs, in all the languages in the world: when should we stop saying \"walk\" and start saying \"run\"? The same happens, of course, with adjectives: when must we stop saying \"yellow\" and start saying \"orange\", or exchange \"past\" for \"present\"? Not only are the topological differences between the words relevant here, but the differentials between what is signified is also covered by différance.\n\nThus, complete meaning is always \"differential\" and \"postponed\" in language; there is never a moment when meaning is complete and total. A simple example would consist of looking up a given word in a dictionary, then proceeding to look up the words found in that word's definition, etc., also comparing with older dictionaries. Such a process would never end.\n\nDerrida describes the task of deconstruction as the identification of metaphysics of presence, or \"logocentrism\" in western philosophy. Metaphysics of presence is the desire for immediate access to meaning, the privileging of presence over absence. This means that there is an assumed bias in certain binary oppositions where one side is placed in a position over another, such as good over bad, speech over the written word, male over female. Derrida writes, \"Without a doubt, Aristotle thinks of time on the basis of ousia as parousia, on the basis of the now, the point, etc. And yet an entire reading could be organized that would repeat in Aristotle's text both this limitation and its opposite\". To Derrida, the central bias of logocentrism was the now being placed as more important than the future or past. This argument is largely based on the earlier work of Heidegger, who, in \"Being and Time\", claimed that the theoretical attitude of pure presence is parasitical upon a more originary involvement with the world in concepts such as ready-to-hand and being-with.\n\nIn the deconstruction procedure, one of the main concerns of Derrida is to not collapse into Hegel's dialectic, where these oppositions would be reduced to contradictions in a dialectic that has the purpose of resolving it into a synthesis. The presence of Hegelian dialectics was enormous in the intellectual life of France during the second half of the 20th century, with the influence of Kojève and Hyppolite, but also with the impact of dialectics based on contradiction developed by Marxists, and including the existentialism of Sartre, etc. This explains Derrida's concern to always distinguish his procedure from Hegel's, since Hegelianism believes binary oppositions would produce a synthesis, while Derrida saw binary oppositions as incapable of collapsing into a synthesis free from the original contradiction.\n\nThere have been problems defining deconstruction. Derrida claimed that all of his essays were attempts to define what deconstruction is, and that deconstruction is necessarily complicated and difficult to explain since it actively criticises the very language needed to explain it.\n\nDerrida has been more forthcoming with negative (apophatic) than with positive descriptions of deconstruction. When asked by Toshihiko Izutsu some preliminary considerations on how to translate \"deconstruction\" in Japanese, in order to at least prevent using a Japanese term contrary to deconstruction's actual meaning, Derrida began his response by saying that such a question amounts to \"what deconstruction is not, or rather \"ought\" not to be\".\n\nDerrida states that deconstruction is not an analysis, a critique, or a method in the traditional sense that philosophy understands these terms. In these negative descriptions of deconstruction, Derrida is seeking to \"multiply the cautionary indicators and put aside all the traditional philosophical concepts\". This does not mean that deconstruction has absolutely nothing in common with an analysis, a critique, or a method, because while Derrida distances deconstruction from these terms, he reaffirms \"the necessity of returning to them, at least under erasure\". Derrida's necessity of returning to a term under erasure means that even though these terms are problematic we must use them until they can be effectively reformulated or replaced. The relevance of the tradition of negative theology to Derrida's preference for negative descriptions of deconstruction is the notion that a positive description of deconstruction would over-determine the idea of deconstruction and would close off the openness that Derrida wishes to preserve for deconstruction. If Derrida were to positively define deconstruction—as, for example, a critique—then this would make the concept of critique immune to itself being deconstructed. Some new philosophy beyond deconstruction would then be required in order to encompass the notion of critique.\n\nDerrida states that \"Deconstruction is not a method, and cannot be transformed into one\". This is because deconstruction is not a mechanical operation. Derrida warns against considering deconstruction as a mechanical operation, when he states that \"It is true that in certain circles (university or cultural, especially in the United States) the technical and methodological \"metaphor\" that seems necessarily attached to the very word 'deconstruction' has been able to seduce or lead astray\". Commentator Richard Beardsworth explains that\n\nDerrida is careful to avoid this term [method] because it carries connotations of a procedural form of judgement. A thinker with a method has already decided \"how\" to proceed, is unable to give him or herself up to the matter of thought in hand, is a functionary of the criteria which structure his or her conceptual gestures. For Derrida [...] this is irresponsibility itself. Thus, to talk of a method in relation to deconstruction, especially regarding its ethico-political implications, would appear to go directly against the current of Derrida's philosophical adventure.\n\nBeardsworth here explains that it would be irresponsible to undertake a deconstruction with a complete set of rules that need only be applied as a method to the object of deconstruction, because this understanding would reduce deconstruction to a thesis of the reader that the text is then made to fit. This would be an irresponsible act of reading, because it becomes a prejudicial procedure that only finds what it sets out to find.\n\nDerrida states that deconstruction is not a critique in the Kantian sense. This is because Kant defines the term critique as the opposite of dogmatism. For Derrida, it is not possible to escape the dogmatic baggage of the language we use in order to perform a pure critique in the Kantian sense. Language is dogmatic because it is inescapably metaphysical. Derrida argues that language is inescapably metaphysical because it is made up of signifiers that only refer to that which transcends them—the signified. In addition, Derrida asks rhetorically \"Is not the idea of knowledge and of the acquisition of knowledge in itself metaphysical?\" By this, Derrida means that all claims to know something necessarily involve an assertion of the metaphysical type that something \"is\" the case somewhere. For Derrida the concept of neutrality is suspect and dogmatism is therefore involved in everything to a certain degree. Deconstruction can challenge a particular dogmatism and hence desediment dogmatism in general, but it cannot escape all dogmatism all at once.\n\nDerrida states that deconstruction is not an analysis in the traditional sense. This is because the possibility of analysis is predicated on the possibility of breaking up the text being analysed into elemental component parts. Derrida argues that there are no self-sufficient units of meaning in a text, because individual words or sentences in a text can only be properly understood in terms of how they fit into the larger structure of the text and language itself. For more on Derrida's theory of meaning see the article on différance.\n\nDerrida states that his use of the word deconstruction first took place in a context in which \"structuralism was dominant\" and deconstruction's meaning is within this context. Derrida states that deconstruction is an \"antistructuralist gesture\" because \"[s]tructures were to be undone, decomposed, desedimented\". At the same time, deconstruction is also a \"structuralist gesture\" because it is concerned with the structure of texts. So, deconstruction involves \"a certain attention to structures\" and tries to \"understand how an 'ensemble' was constituted\". As both a structuralist and an antistructuralist gesture, deconstruction is tied up with what Derrida calls the \"structural problematic\". The structural problematic for Derrida is the tension between genesis, that which is \"in the essential mode of creation or movement\", and structure: \"systems, or complexes, or static configurations\". An example of genesis would be the sensory ideas from which knowledge is then derived in the empirical epistemology. An example of structure would be a binary opposition such as good and evil where the meaning of each element is established, at least partly, through its relationship to the other element.\n\nIt is for this reason that Derrida distances his use of the term deconstruction from post-structuralism, a term that would suggest that philosophy could simply go beyond structuralism. Derrida states that \"the motif of deconstruction has been associated with 'post-structuralism, but that this term was \"a word unknown in France until its 'return' from the United States\". In his deconstruction of Husserl, Derrida actually argues the contamination of pure origins by the structures of language and temporality. Manfred Frank has even referred to Derrida's work as \"Neostructuralism\".\n\nThe popularity of the term deconstruction, combined with the technical difficulty of Derrida's primary material on deconstruction and his reluctance to elaborate his understanding of the term, has meant that many secondary sources have attempted to give a more straightforward explanation than Derrida himself ever attempted. Secondary definitions are therefore an interpretation of deconstruction by the person offering them rather than a summary of Derrida's actual position.\n\n\nA survey of the secondary literature reveals a wide range of heterogeneous arguments. Particularly problematic are the attempts to give neat introductions to deconstruction by people trained in literary criticism who sometimes have little or no expertise in the relevant areas of philosophy that Derrida is working in. These secondary works (e.g. \"Deconstruction for Beginners\" and \"Deconstructions: A User's Guide\") have attempted to explain deconstruction while being academically criticized as too far removed from the original texts and Derrida's actual position.\n\nDerrida's observations have greatly influenced literary criticism and post-structuralism.\n\nDerrida's method consisted of demonstrating all the forms and varieties of the originary complexity of semiotics, and their multiple consequences in many fields. His way of achieving this was by conducting thorough, careful, sensitive, and yet transformational readings of philosophical and literary texts, with an ear to what in those texts runs counter to their apparent systematicity (structural unity) or intended sense (authorial genesis). By demonstrating the aporias and ellipses of thought, Derrida hoped to show the infinitely subtle ways that this originary complexity, which by definition cannot ever be completely known, works its structuring and destructuring effects.\n\nDeconstruction denotes the pursuing of the meaning of a text to the point of exposing the supposed contradictions and internal oppositions upon which it is founded—supposedly showing that those foundations are irreducibly complex, unstable, or impossible. It is an approach that may be deployed in philosophy, in literary analysis, and even in the analysis of scientific writings. Deconstruction generally tries to demonstrate that any text is not a discrete whole but contains several irreconcilable and contradictory meanings; that any text therefore has more than one interpretation; that the text itself links these interpretations inextricably; that the incompatibility of these interpretations is irreducible; and thus that an interpretative reading cannot go beyond a certain point. Derrida refers to this point as an \"aporia\" in the text; thus, deconstructive reading is termed \"aporetic.\" He insists that meaning is made possible by the relations of a word to other words within the network of structures that language is.\n\nDerrida initially resisted granting to his approach the overarching name \"deconstruction\", on the grounds that it was a precise technical term that could not be used to characterize his work generally. Nevertheless, he eventually accepted that the term had come into common use to refer to his textual approach, and Derrida himself increasingly began to use the term in this more general way.\n\nDerrida's deconstruction strategy is also used by postmodernists to locate meaning in a text rather than discover meaning due to the position that it has multiple readings. There is a focus on the deconstruction that denotes the tearing apart of a text to find arbitrary hierarchies and presuppositions for the purpose of tracing contradictions that shadow a text's coherence. Here, the meaning of a text does not reside with the author or the author's intentions because it is dependent on the interaction between reader and text. Even the process of translation is also seen as transformative since it \"modifies the original even as it modifies the translating language.\"\n\nDerrida's lecture at Johns Hopkins University, \"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Human Sciences\", often appears in collections as a manifesto against structuralism. Derrida's essay was one of the earliest to propose some theoretical limitations to structuralism, and to attempt to theorize on terms that were clearly no longer structuralist. Structuralism viewed language as a number of signs, composed of a signified (the meaning) and a signifier (the word itself). Derrida proposed that signs always referred to other signs, existing only in relation to each other, and there was therefore no ultimate foundation or centre. This is the basis of différance.\n\nBetween the late 1960s and the early 1980s, many thinkers were influenced by deconstruction, including Paul de Man, Geoffrey Hartman, and J. Hillis Miller. This group came to be known as the Yale school and was especially influential in literary criticism. Derrida and Hillis Miller were subsequently affiliated with the University of California, Irvine.\n\nMiller has described deconstruction this way: \"Deconstruction is not a dismantling of the structure of a text, but a demonstration that it has already dismantled itself. Its apparently solid ground is no rock, but thin air.\"\n\nArguing that law and politics cannot be separated, the founders of the \"Critical Legal Studies Movement\" found it necessary to criticize the absence of the recognition of this inseparability at the level of theory. To demonstrate the indeterminacy of legal doctrine, these scholars often adopt a method, such as structuralism in linguistics, or deconstruction in Continental philosophy, to make explicit the deep structure of categories and tensions at work in legal texts and talk. The aim was to deconstruct the tensions and procedures by which they are constructed, expressed, and deployed.\n\nFor example, Duncan Kennedy, in explicit reference to semiotics and deconstruction procedures, maintains that various legal doctrines are constructed around the binary pairs of opposed concepts, each of which has a claim upon intuitive and formal forms of reasoning that must be made explicit in their meaning and relative value, and criticized. Self and other, private and public, subjective and objective, freedom and control are examples of such pairs demonstrating the influence of opposing concepts on the development of legal doctrines throughout history.\n\nDeconstructive readings of history and sources have changed the entire discipline of history. In \"Deconstructing History\", Alun Munslow examines history in what he argues is a postmodern age. He provides an introduction to the debates and issues of postmodernist history. He also surveys the latest research into the relationship between the past, history, and historical practice, as well as articulating his own theoretical challenges.\n\nJean-Luc Nancy argues, in his 1982 book \"The Inoperative Community\", for an understanding of community and society that is undeconstructable because it is prior to conceptualisation. Nancy's work is an important development of deconstruction because it takes the challenge of deconstruction seriously and attempts to develop an understanding of political terms that is undeconstructable and therefore suitable for a philosophy after Derrida.\n\nSimon Critchley, an English philosopher, argues, in his 1992 book \"The Ethics of Deconstruction\", that Derrida's deconstruction is an intrinsically ethical practice. Critchley argues that deconstruction involves an openness to the Other that makes it ethical in the Levinasian understanding of the term.\n\nJacques Derrida has had a great influence on contemporary political theory and political philosophy. Derrida's thinking has inspired Slavoj Zizek, Richard Rorty, Ernesto Laclau, Judith Butler and many more contemporary theorists who have developed a deconstructive approach to politics. Because deconstruction examines the internal logic of any given text or discourse it has helped many authors to analyse the contradictions inherent in all schools of thought; and, as such, it has proved revolutionary in political analysis, particularly ideology critiques.\n\nRichard Beardsworth, developing from Critchley's \"Ethics of Deconstruction\", argues, in his 1996 \"Derrida and the Political\", that deconstruction is an intrinsically political practice. He further argues that the future of deconstruction faces a perhaps undecidable choice between a theological approach and a technological approach, represented first of all by the work of Bernard Stiegler.\n\nDerrida was involved in a number of high-profile disagreements with prominent philosophers, including Michel Foucault, John Searle, Willard Van Orman Quine, Peter Kreeft, and Jürgen Habermas. Most of the criticism of deconstruction were first articulated by these philosophers and repeated elsewhere.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Searle had a brief exchange with Jacques Derrida regarding speech-act theory. The exchange was characterized by a degree of mutual hostility between the philosophers, each of whom accused the other of having misunderstood his basic points. Searle was particularly hostile to Derrida's deconstructionist framework and much later refused to let his response to Derrida be printed along with Derrida's papers in the 1988 collection \"Limited Inc\". Searle did not consider Derrida's approach to be legitimate philosophy, or even intelligible writing, and argued that he did not want to legitimize the deconstructionist point of view by paying any attention to it. Consequently, some critics have considered the exchange to be a series of elaborate misunderstandings rather than a debate, while others have seen either Derrida or Searle gaining the upper hand. The level of hostility can be seen from Searle's statement that \"It would be a mistake to regard Derrida's discussion of Austin as a confrontation between two prominent philosophical traditions\", to which Derrida replied that that sentence was \"the only sentence of the 'reply' to which I can subscribe\". Commentators have frequently interpreted the exchange as a prominent example of a confrontation between analytic and Continental philosophies.\n\nThe debate began in 1972, when, in his paper \"Signature Event Context\", Derrida analyzed J. L. Austin's theory of the illocutionary act. While sympathetic to Austin's departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes \"force\", Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin. Derrida argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a \"structure of absence\" (the words that are left unsaid due to contextual constraints) and by \"iterability\" (the constraints on what can be said, imposed by what has been said in the past). Derrida argued that the focus on intentionality in speech-act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention. He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction, non-serious, or \"parasitic\" speech, wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres as governed by different structures of meaning, or hadn't considered them due to a lack of interest. In his brief reply to Derrida, \"Reiterating the Differences: A Reply to Derrida\", Searle argued that Derrida's critique was unwarranted because it assumed that Austin's theory attempted to give a full account of language and meaning when its aim was much narrower. Searle considered the omission of parasitic discourse forms to be justified by the narrow scope of Austin's inquiry. Searle agreed with Derrida's proposal that intentionality presupposes iterability, but did not apply the same concept of intentionality used by Derrida, being unable or unwilling to engage with the continental conceptual apparatus. This, in turn, caused Derrida to criticize Searle for not being sufficiently familiar with phenomenological perspectives on intentionality. Searle also argued that Derrida's disagreement with Austin turned on Derrida's having misunderstood Austin's type–token distinction and having failed to understand Austin's concept of failure in relation to performativity. Some critics have suggested that Searle, by being so grounded in the analytical tradition that he was unable to engage with Derrida's continental phenomenological tradition, was at fault for the unsuccessful nature of the exchange.\n\nDerrida, in his response to Searle ( in \"Limited Inc\"), ridiculed Searle's positions. Claiming that a clear sender of Searle's message could not be established, Derrida suggested that Searle had formed with Austin a \"société à responsabilité limitée\" (a \"limited liability company\") due to the ways in which the ambiguities of authorship within Searle's reply circumvented the very speech act of his reply. Searle did not reply. Later in 1988, Derrida tried to review his position and his critiques of Austin and Searle, reiterating that he found the constant appeal to \"normality\" in the analytical tradition to be problematic.\n\nIn the debate, Derrida praised Austin's work, but argued that Austin is wrong to banish what Austin calls \"infelicities\" from the \"normal\" operation of language. One \"infelicity\", for instance, occurs when it cannot be known whether a given speech act is \"sincere\" or \"merely citational\" (and therefore possibly ironic). Derrida argues that every iteration is necessarily \"citational\", due to the graphematic nature of speech and writing, and that language could not work at all without the ever-present and ineradicable possibility of such alternate readings. Derrida takes Searle to task for attempting to get around this issue by grounding final authority in the speaker's inaccessible \"intention\". Derrida argues that intention cannot possibly govern how an iteration signifies, once it becomes hearable or readable. All speech acts borrow from a language whose significance is determined by historical-linguistic context, and by the alternate possibilities that this context makes possible. This significance, Derrida argues, cannot be altered or governed by the whims of intention.\n\nDerrida argued against the constant appeal to \"normality\" in the analytical tradition of which Austin and Searle were paradigmatic examples.\n\nDerrida argued that it was problematic to establish the relation between \"nonfiction or standard discourse\" and \"fiction,\" defined as its \"parasite, \"for part of the most originary essence of the latter is to allow fiction, the simulacrum, parasitism, to take place—and in so doing to \"de-essentialize\" itself as it were\".\nHe would finally argue that the indispensable question would then become:\nIn 1995, Searle gave a brief reply to Derrida in \"The Construction of Social Reality\". He called Derrida's conclusion \"preposterous\" and stated that \"Derrida, as far as I can tell, does not have an argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts...\" Searle's reference here is not to anything forwarded in the debate, but to a mistranslation of the phrase \"\"il n'y a pas dehors du texte\",\" (\"There is no outside-text\") which appears in Derrida's \"Of Grammatology\".\n\nIn \"The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity\", Jürgen Habermas criticized what he considered Derrida's opposition to rational discourse.\n\nFurther, in an essay on religion and religious language, Habermas criticized Derrida's insistence on etymology and philology (see \"Etymological fallacy\").\n\nThe American philosopher Walter A. Davis, in \"Inwardness and Existence: Subjectivity in/and Hegel, Heidegger, Marx and Freud\", argues that both deconstruction and structuralism are prematurely arrested moments of a dialectical movement that issues from Hegelian \"unhappy consciousness\".\n\nPopular criticism of deconstruction intensified following the Sokal affair, which many people took as an indicator of the quality of deconstruction as a whole, despite the absence of Derrida from Sokal's follow-up book \"Impostures Intellectuelles\".\n\nChip Morningstar holds a view critical of deconstruction, believing it to be \"epistemologically challenged\". He claims the humanities are subject to isolation and genetic drift due to their unaccountability to the world outside academia. During the Second International Conference on Cyberspace (Santa Cruz, California, 1991), he reportedly heckled deconstructionists off the stage. He subsequently presented his views in the article \"How to Deconstruct Almost Anything\", where he stated, \"Contrary to the report given in the 'Hype List' column of issue #1 of Wired ('Po-Mo Gets Tek-No', page 87), we did not shout down the postmodernists. We made fun of them.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It was coined in 1894 by psychical researcher Charles Richet. Although the term is widespread in popular culture, the physical existence of ectoplasm is not accepted by science and many purported examples were exposed as hoaxes fashioned from cheesecloth, gauze or other natural substances.\n\nIn spiritualism, ectoplasm is said to be formed by physical mediums when in a trance state. This material is excreted as a gauze-like substance from orifices on the medium's body and spiritual entities are said to drape this substance over their nonphysical body, enabling them to interact in the physical and real universe. Some accounts claim that ectoplasm begins clear and almost invisible, but darkens and becomes visible, as the psychic energy becomes stronger. Still other accounts state that in extreme cases ectoplasm will develop a strong odor. According to some mediums, the ectoplasm cannot occur in light conditions as the ectoplasmic substance would disintegrate.\n\nThe psychical researcher Gustav Geley defined ectoplasm as being “very variable in appearance, being sometimes vaporous, sometimes a plastic paste, sometimes a bundle of fine threads, or a membrane with swellings or fringes, or a fine fabric-like tissue”. Arthur Conan Doyle described ectoplasm as “a viscous, gelatinous substance which appeared to differ from every known form of matter in that it could solidify and be used for material purposes”.\n\nScience does not accept the physical existence of ectoplasm, and some tested samples purported to be ectoplasm have been found to be various non-paranormal substances. Other researchers have duplicated, with non-supernatural materials, the photographic effects sometimes said to prove the existence of ectoplasm.\n\nThe idea of ectoplasm was merged into the notion of an \"ectenic force\" by some early psychical researchers who were seeking a physical explanation for reports of psychokinesis in séances. Its existence was initially hypothesized by Count Agenor de Gasparin, to explain the phenomena of table turning and tapping during séances. Ectenic force was named by de Gasparin's colleague M. Thury, a professor of natural history at the Academy of Geneva. Between them, de Gasparin and Thury conducted a number of experiments in ectenic force, and claimed some success. Their work was not independently verified.\n\nOther psychical researchers who studied mediumship speculated that within the human body an unidentified fluid termed the \"psychode\", \"psychic force\" or \"ecteneic force\" existed and was capable of being released to influence matter. This view was held by Camille Flammarion and William Crookes, however a later psychical researcher Hereward Carrington pointed out that the fluid was hypothetical and has never been discovered.\n\nThe psychical investigator W. J. Crawford (1881–1920) had claimed that a fluid substance was responsible for levitation of objects after witnessing the medium Kathleen Goligher. Crawford, after witnessing a number of her séances, claimed to have obtained flashlight photographs of the substance; he later described the substance as \"plasma\". He claimed the substance is not visible to the naked eye but can be felt by the body.\n\nThe physicist and psychical researcher Edmund Edward Fournier d'Albe later investigated the medium Kathleen Goligher at many sittings and arrived at the opposite conclusions to Crawford; according to D'Albe, no paranormal phenomena such as levitation had occurred with Goligher and stated he had found evidence of fraud. D'Albe claimed the substance in the photographs of Crawford was ordinary muslin. During a séance D'Albe had observed white muslin between Goligher's feet.\n\nEctoplasm on many occasions has been proven to be fraudulent. Many mediums had used methods of swallowing and regurgitating cheesecloth, textile products smoothed with potato starch and in other cases the ectoplasm was made from paper, cloth and egg white or butter muslin.\n\nThe Society for Psychical Research investigations into mediumship exposed many fraudulent mediums which contributed to the decline of interest in physical mediumship. In 1907, Hereward Carrington exposed the tricks of fraudulent mediums such as those used in slate-writing, table-turning, trumpet mediumship, materializations, sealed-letter reading and spirit photography.\n\nIn the early 20th century the psychical researcher Albert von Schrenck-Notzing investigated the medium Eva Carrière and claimed her ectoplasm \"materializations\" were not from spirits but the result of \"ideoplasty\" in which the medium could form images onto ectoplasm from her mind. Schrenck-Notzing published the book \"Phenomena of Materialisation\" (1923) which included photographs of the ectoplasm. Critics pointed out the photographs of the ectoplasm revealed marks of magazine cut-outs, pins and a piece of string. Schrenck-Notzing admitted that on several occasions Carrière deceptively smuggled pins into the séance room. The magician Carlos María de Heredia replicated the ectoplasm of Carrière using a comb, gauze and a handkerchief.\n\nDonald West wrote that the ectoplasm of Carrière was fake and was made of cut-out paper faces from newspapers and magazines on which fold marks could sometimes be seen from the photographs. A photograph of Carrière taken from the back of the ectoplasm face revealed it to be made from a magazine cut out with the letters \"Le Miro\". The two-dimensional face had been clipped from the French magazine Le Miroir. Back issues of the magazine also matched some of Carrière's ectoplasm faces. Cut out faces that she used included Woodrow Wilson, King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, French president Raymond Poincaré and the actress Mona Delza.\nAfter Schrenck-Notzing discovered Carrière had taken her ectoplasm faces from the magazine he defended her by claiming she had read the magazine but her memory had recalled the images and they had materialized into the ectoplasm. Because of this Schrenck-Notzing was described as credulous. Joseph McCabe wrote \"In Germany and Austria, Baron von Schrenck-Notzing is the laughing-stock of his medical colleagues.\"\n\nThe Danish medium Einer Nielsen was investigated by a committee from the Kristiania University in Norway in 1922 and it was discovered in a séance that his ectoplasm was fake. Nielsen was also caught hiding his ectoplasm in his rectum. Mina Crandon was a famous medium known for producing ectoplasm during her séance sittings. She produced a small ectoplasmic hand from her stomach which waved about in the darkness. Her career ended however when biologists examined the hand and found it to be made of a piece of carved animal liver. Walter Franklin Prince described the Crandon case as \"the most ingenious, persistent, and fantastic complex of fraud in the history of psychic research.\"\n\nThe psychical researchers Eric Dingwall and Harry Price re-published an anonymous work written by a former medium entitled \"Revelations of a Spirit Medium\" (1922) which exposed the tricks of mediumship and the fraudulent methods of producing \"spirit hands\". Originally all the copies of the book were bought up by spiritualists and deliberately destroyed. On the subject of ectoplasm and fraud John Ryan Haule wrote:\n\nBecause ectoplasm was believed susceptible to destruction by light, the possibility that ectoplasm might appear became a reason for making sure that Victorian séances took place in near darkness. Poor lighting conditions also became an opportunity for fraud, particularly as faux ectoplasm was easy to make with a mixture of soap, gelatin and egg white, or perhaps merely well-placed muslin. \n\nPsychical researcher Harry Price exposed medium Helen Duncan's fraudulent techniques by proving, through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan, that it was cheesecloth that she had swallowed and regurgitated. Duncan had also used dolls' heads and masks as ectoplasm. Mediums would also cut pictures from magazines and stick them to the cheesecloth to pretend they were spirits of the dead. Another researcher, C. D. Broad, wrote that ectoplasm in many cases has proven to be composed of home material such as butter-muslin and that there is no solid evidence that it has anything to do with spirits.\n\nThe photographs taken by Thomas Glendenning Hamilton of ectoplasm reveal the substance to be made of tissue paper and magazine cut-outs of people. The famous photograph taken by Hamilton of the medium Mary Ann Marshall (1880–1963) depicts tissue paper with a cut out of Arthur Conan Doyle's head from a newspaper. Skeptics have suspected that Hamilton may have been behind the hoax. The mediums Rita Goold and Alec Harris dressed up in their séances as ectoplasm spirits and were exposed as frauds. The exposures of fraudulent ectoplasm in séances caused a rapid decline in physical mediumship.\n\n"}

The Jebbs were a well-off family and had a strong social conscience and commitment to public service. Her mother, Eglantyne Louisa Jebb, had founded the Home Arts and Industries Association, to promote Arts and Crafts among young people in rural areas; her sister Louisa would help found the Women's Land Army in World War I. Another sister, Dorothy Frances Jebb, who married the Labour MP Charles Roden Buxton, campaigned against the demonisation of the German people after the war.\nShe also served a faculty member at Wellesley College in 1929, teaching courses in English literature.\n\nShe was known as the \"White Flame\" because the flame of her dedicated love for children in distress burned to a white heat of passion all her life.\n\nHaving studied history at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, Jebb trained to become a school teacher, but a year's experience as a Primary School teacher, at St. Peter's Junior School in Marlborough, convinced her that this was not her vocation, though it increased her awareness of the difficulties and widespread nature of poverty faced by young children.\n\nShe moved to Cambridge to look after her sick mother. There she became involved in the Charity Organisation Society, which aimed to bring a modern scientific approach to charity work. This led her to carry out an extensive research project into conditions in the city, and in 1906 she published a book, \"Cambridge, a Study in Social Questions\" based on her research.\n\nThe Cambridge Independent Press, a weekly liberal-supporting newspaper published a number of articles covering Eglantyne's campaigning and political activities in Cambridge in the run up to the First World War. She was appointed to the Education Committee of Cambridge Borough Council in 1907, although in her first year only attended 13 of a possible 31 meetings. She was also on the committee of the newly formed League for Physical Education and Improvement, but resigned citing pressures from other workloads.\n\nUnder the watchful eye of Florence Ada Keynes Eglantyne and Florence's daughter Margaret set up and ran the Boy's employment registry, shortly followed by a similar one for girls. There is now a Blue Plaque above 82 Regent Street where the employment registry was sited.\n\nIn 1913 she was asked to undertake a journey to Macedonia on behalf of the Macedonian Relief Fund. She returned shortly before the First World War broke out, and soon was drawn into a project organised by Dorothy, who had begun importing European newspapers – including ones from Germany and Austria-Hungary for which a special licence had to be obtained from the government – and publishing extracts in English in the \"Cambridge Magazine\", which revealed that everyday life in the enemy countries was far worse than government propaganda suggested.\n\nAs the war was coming to an end, and the German and Austro-Hungarian economies came near to collapse, it was clear to Dorothy and Eglantyne that the children of these countries were suffering appallingly from the effects of the war and the Allied blockade, which continued even when an armistice was signed. A pressure group, the Fight the Famine Council, was set up in 1919 to persuade the British government to end the blockade.\n\nSoon, however, the focus shifted to organising relief. On 15 April 1919, the Council set up a fund to raise money for the German and Austrian children – the Save the Children Fund. Unexpectedly, this organisation, launched at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 19 May 1919, quickly raised a large sum of money from the British public, and officials were despatched to organise relief work.\n\nThe success of the Fund led Eglantyne and Dorothy to attempt to set up an international movement for children. The International Save the Children Union (\"Union International de Secours à l'Enfant\") was founded in Geneva in 1920, with the British Save the Children Fund and the Swedish Rädda Barnen as leading members.\n\nIn London, it was now Eglantyne who was in charge, and she ensured that the Fund adopted the professional approach she had learnt in the Charity Organisation Society. A manager, Lewis Golden, was recruited to put the organisation on a businesslike foundation. He adopted the innovative – and controversial – approach of taking full-page advertisements in national newspapers; it was highly effective, and raised very substantial amounts of income for the Fund's work.\n\nAs the problems in central Europe receded, there was a new focus of the Fund's attention – a refugee crisis in Greece and the surrounding areas, a consequence of the continuing conflict in the area. Then in 1921, just as this situation was coming under control, there was a new and bigger emergency. Partly as a consequence of the devastation of war, revolution and civil war, and partly due to the disastrous economic policies of the Bolshevik government, the people of Soviet Russia faced a famine as crops failed. A new fundraising effort brought a surge of donations, and a Save the Children team was dispatched to the city of Saratov, one of the main famine centres.\n\nIn all the work the Fund did, a major element in Eglantyne's thinking was the importance of a planned, research-based approach. In 1923, when the Russian relief effort was coming to an end, and the Fund's income was sharply reducing, she turned to another issue – that of children's rights. She headed to Geneva, to a meeting of the International Union, with a plan for a Children's Charter. The result was a short and clear document – drafted by Eglantyne – which asserted the rights of children and the duty of the international community to put children's rights in the forefront of planning. The Declaration of the Rights of the Child, or the Declaration of Geneva as it came to be known, was adopted a year later by the League of Nations.\n\nWith peace returning to Europe, and relief efforts in decline, the focus of the Save the Children movement shifted to promoting the Declaration. In 1925, the first International Child Welfare congress was held in Geneva. The Declaration was widely discussed and supported by organisations and governments. An expanded version would be adopted by the United Nations in 1959, and it was one of the main inspirations behind the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nAfter many years of ill health due to a thyroid problem, including three operations for goitre, Eglantyne Jebb died in a nursing home in Geneva in 1928, and is buried there in St George's cemetery. Save the Children, which she and her sister Dorothy (who converted to the Society of Friends with her husband) founded in England in 1919 and as an international organisation based in Geneva the following year, remains active today. Also, the Church of England remembers her life and service annually on its liturgical calendar on 17 December.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39104546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39104546", "title": "Evolutionary psychology of language", "text": "Evolutionary psychology of language\n\nEvolutionary psychology of language is the study of the evolutionary history of language as a psychological faculty within the discipline of evolutionary psychology. It makes the assumption that language is the result of a Darwinian adaptation.\n\nThere are many competing theories of how language might have evolved, if indeed it is an evolutionary adaptation. They stem from the belief that language development could result from an adaptation, an exaptation, or a by-product. Genetics also influence the study of the evolution of language. It has been speculated that the FOXP2 gene may be what gives humans the ability to develop grammar and syntax.\n\nIn the debate surrounding the evolutionary psychology of language, three sides emerge: those who believe in language as an adaptation, those who believe it is a by-product of another adaptation, and those who believe it is an exaptation.\n\nScientist and psychologists Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom argue that language as a mental faculty shares many likenesses with the complex organs of the body which suggests that, like these organs, language has evolved as an adaptation, since this is the only known mechanism by which such complex organs can develop. The complexity of the mechanisms, the faculty of language and the ability to learn language provides a comparative resource between the psychological evolved traits and the physical evolved traits.\n\nPinker, though he mostly agrees with Noam Chomsky, a linguist and cognitive scientist, in arguing that the fact that children can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction, but Pinker and Bloom argue that the organic nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin.\n\nNoam Chomsky spearheaded the debate on the faculty of language as a cognitive by-product, or spandrel. As a linguist, rather than an evolutionary biologist, his theoretical emphasis was on the infinite capacity of speech and speaking: there are a fixed number of words, but there is an infinite combination of the words. His analysis from this considers that the ability of our cognition to perceive infinite possibilities, or create infinite possibilities, helped give way to the extreme complexity found in our language. Both Chomsky and Gould argue that the complexity of the brain is in itself an adaptation, and language arises from such complexities.\nOn the issue of whether language is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a by product, evolutionary biologist W. Tecumseh Fitch, following Stephen J. Gould, argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation. He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptationist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether \"Language has evolved as an adaptation\" as being misleading.\nHe argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system. A similar argument is made by Terrence Deacon who in \"The Symbolic Species\" argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use symbolic communication is integrated in all other cognitive processes.\n\nExaptations, like adaptations, are fitness-enhancing characteristics, but, according to Stephen Jay Gould, their purposes were appropriated as the species evolved. This can be for one of two reasons: either the trait’s original function was no longer necessary so the trait took on a new purpose or a trait that does not arise for a certain purpose, but later becomes important. Typically exaptations have a specific shape and design which becomes the space for a new function. The foundation of this argument comes from the low-lying position of the larynx in humans. Other mammals have this same positioning of the larynx, but no other species has acquired language. This leads exaptationists to see an evolved modification away from its original purpose.\n\nResearch has shown that “genetic constraints” on language evolution could have caused a “specialized” and “species-specific language module. It is through this module that there are many specified “domain-specific linguistic properties,” such as syntax and agreement. Adaptationists believe that language genes “coevolved with human language itself for the purpose of communication.” This view suggests that the genes that are involved with language would only have coevolved in a very stable linguist environment. This shows that language could not have evolved in a rapidly changing environment because that type of environment would not have been stable enough for natural selection. Without natural selection, the genes would not have coevolved with the ability for language, and instead, would have come from “cultural conventions.” The adaptationist belief that genes coevolved with language also suggests that there are no “arbitrary properties of language.” This is because they would have coevolved with language through natural selection.\nThe Baldwin effect provides a possible explanation for how language characteristics that are learned over time could become encoded in genes. He suggested, like Darwin did, that organisms that can adapt a trait faster have a “selective advantage.” As generations pass, less environmental stimuli is needed for organisms of the species to develop that trait. Eventually no environmental stimuli are needed and it is at this point that the trait has become “genetically encoded.”\n\nThe genetic and cognitive components of language have long been under speculation, only recently have linguists been able to point out a gene that may possibly explain how language works. Evolutionary psychologists hold that the FOXP2 gene may well be associated with the evolution of human language. In the 1980s, psycholinguist Myrna Gopnik identified a dominant gene that causes language impairment in the KE family of Britain. The KE family has a mutation in the FOXP2, that makes them suffer from a speech and language disorder. It has been argued that the FOXP2 gene is the grammar gene, which is what allows humans the ability to form proper syntax and make our communication of higher quality. Children that grow up in a stable environment are able to develop highly proficient language without any instruction. Individuals with a mutation to their FOXP2 gene have trouble mastering complex sentences, and shows signs of developmental verbal dyspraxia.\n\nThis gene most likely evolved in the hominin line after the hominin and the chimpanzee lines split; this accounts for the fact that humans are the only ones able to learn and understand grammar. Humans have a unique allele of this gene, which has otherwise been closely conserved through most of mammalian evolutionary history. This unique allele seems to have first appeared between 100 and 200 thousand years ago, and it is now all but universal in humans. This suggests that speech evolved late in overall spectrum of human evolution.\n\nIn the world there are nearly 7000 languages, there is great amount of variation and this variation is thought to have come about through cultural differentiation. There are four factors that are thought to be the reason as to why there is language variation between cultures: founder effects, drift, hybridization and adaptation. With the vast amounts of lands available different tribes began to form and to claim their territory, in order to differentiate themselves many of these groups made changes to their language and this how the evolution of languages began. There also tended to be drifts in the population a certain group would get lost and be isolated from the rest of the group, this group would lose touch with the other groups and before they knew there had been mutations in their language and a whole new language had been formed.\n\nHybridization also played a big role in the language evolution, one group would come in contact with another tribe and they would pick up words and sounds from each other eventually leading to the formation of a new language. Adaptation would also play a role in the evolution of language differentiation, the environment and the circumstances were constantly changing therefore the groups had to adapt to the environment and their language had to adapt to it as well, it is all about maximizing fitness.\n\nAtkinson theorized that language may have originated in Africa since African languages have a greater variation of speech sounds than other languages. Those sounds are seen as the root for the other languages that exist across the world.\n\nResearch indicates that nonhuman animals (e.g., apes, dolphins, and songbirds) show evidence of language. Comparative studies of the sensory-motor system reveal that speech is not special to humans: nonhuman primates can discriminate between two different spoken languages. Anatomical aspects of humans, particularly the descended larynx, has been believed to be unique to humans' capacity to speak. However, further research revealed that several other mammals have a descended larynx beside humans, which indicates that a descended larynx must not be the only anatomical feature needed for speech production.\nVocal imitation is not uniquely human as well. Songbirds seem to acquire species-specific songs by imitating. Because nonhuman primates do not have a descended larynx, they lack vocal imitative capacity, which is why studies involving these primates have taught them nonverbal means of communication, e.g., sign language.\n\nKoko and Nim Chimpsky are two apes that have successfully learned to use sign language, but not to the extent that a human being can. Nim is a chimpanzee that was taken in by a family in the 1970s and was raised as if he were a human child. Nim was able to master 150 signs, which were limited but useful. Koko was a gorilla that was taken in by a Berkley student. She was able to master 600 signs for generative communication. Koko and Nim were not able to develop speech due to the fact that they lack the larynx which is what distinguishes humans from other animals and allows them to speak.\n\n"}

This long stretch of time is divided into Old Gan, late Old Gan, and Middle Gan periods.\n\nOld Gan (上古贛語, \"Song-gu Gon-ngi\") or Proto-Gan (原始贛語, \"Ngien-si Gon-ngi\") was spoken between the beginning of the Qin dynasty to the latter part of the Han dynasty.\n\nIn the year of 221 BC, General Tu Sui (屠睢) was sent on behalf of the Qin dynasty to the south of China in order to conquer the territory of Baiyue. 500,000 soldiers then settled down at Yugan, Nankang and three other places. This formed the initial Chinese population in Jiangxi. In 202 BC, Yuzhang Prefecture (豫章郡) was set up by the Han dynasty. Following this, the local population increased rapidly.\n\nLate Old Gan (中古贛語, \"Zung-gu Gon-ngi\") was spoken between the 3rd and 6th centuries. It was largely sinicized by new settlers from the Central Plain. Some scholars consider late Old Gan, together with Hakka Chinese and the Tongtai dialect of Jianghuai Mandarin to have been the lingua franca of the Southern Dynasties.\n\nHowever, late Old Gan was still distinctly different from the official language. \"History of Southern Dynasties\" records that \nMiddle Gan (中世贛語, \"Zung-si Gon-ngi\") is the variety of Gan spoken between the Tang and Song dynasties (from the 6th to the 13th century). The last time of large-scale settlement in Jiangxi by people from the Central Plain took place as a result of the An Lushan Rebellion. Gan also became stabilized following this period.\n\nResearch on the rhyming system of Jiangxi poets of this period has been made in order to reconstruct the linguistic form of Middle Gan. Scholars have found that modern Gan still keeps many linguistic characteristics of this historical layer.\nFor example,\n\n\nLate Middle Gan (近世贛語, \"Qin-si Gon-ngi\") was the form of Gan spoken between the Yuan and Ming dynasties (from the 13th to the 17th century).\nSome linguistic characteristics of late Middle Gan are:\n\nEarly Modern Gan (近代贛語, \"Qin-tai Gon-ngi\") was the form of Gan spoken from the Qing dynasty (17th century) up to the beginning of modern times.\n\nThe textbook \"Lei Zi Meng Qiu\" (類字蒙求) published in the middle of the 19th century has been used to understand the linguistic form of Nanchang dialect; scholars have found that Gan has stayed relatively stable from this time. For example, the nasal ending merged into , and 7 tones were used.\n\nWesterners also began to study Gan during this period. British diplomatic official Edward Harper Parker was the first westerner to recorded Gan speech. He noticed his friend Wen-yuan of Fuzhou merged muddy consonants with aspirate consonants.\n\nBibles in some Gan dialects were also published at this time.\n\n\n"}

The term 'Illyro-Roman' can also be used to describe the Roman settlers who colonized Illyricum. The remnants of the Illyro-Romans, called \"Vlachs\" in literature, were absorbed by the western South Slavs and Albanians.\n\nThe Illyrian tribes were considered barbarians by both the Romans and the Hellenic peoples in the southern Balkans. They considered them among the vast group of barbarian peoples such as the Gauls, Germans and Dacians. The conquest of Illyria in 168 BC, along with that of Epirus, consolidated the Roman domain over the Adriatic Sea. The mountainous geography of the region meant that the region was hard to subdue, but by 9 CE the Great Illyrian Revolt had been quelled and from then on the region would supply large numbers of non-citizen soldiers to the Roman Auxilia.\n\nThe Romanization of these barbarian peoples eventually transformed them into the most valuable soldiers of the Late Roman Army, with a substantial portion of the officials and generals coming from a northern balkanic background, such as Illyria, Dalmatia, Pannonia and Moesia. One emperor, Decius, several usurpers and during the reign of Gallienus, who started the professionalization of the high command of the army, large numbers of soldiers achieved high rank within the army. They took the place which the Senatorial order had had the privilege of holding since the time of Augustus, 250 years earlier, the command of the legions and armed provinces.\n\nIllyricum was heavily colonized by the Romans beginning in the third century BC. The Romans founded the cities of Acruvium, Cibalae, Mursa, Narona, Siscia, and established colonies at Salona, Sirmium, Epidaurum, Aequum, Iader, Rhizon, and in many other cities. These cities were colonized by Roman war veterans.\n\nIt was from this group that the most successful emperors of the time came from and it was they who brought the Crisis of the Third Century to an end. Examples include Claudius II Gothicus, Aurelian, and Probus. The creator of the Tetrarchy Diocletian and his fellow Tetrarchs Maximian, Constantius Chlorus (father of the first Christian emperor Constantine) and Severus II were also of Illyro-Roman background.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3355634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3355634", "title": "Kkangpae", "text": "Kkangpae\n\nKkangpae (Korean: 깡패) is a romanization of the Korean for a 'gangster', 'thug', or 'hoodlum', usually referring to members of unorganized street gangs. This is as opposed to mafiosos or members of organised crime gangs, which are known as geondal (Korean: 건달), or jopok (Korean: 조폭; Hanja: 組暴).\n\nCriminal gangs have featured in South Korean popular culture, including films and television, over the past decades.\n\nThe Korean mafia may have been established in the 19th century, towards the end of the Joseon dynasty, with the rise of commerce and the emergence of investment from European colonial powers. At this time, pre-existing street gangs, which were largely lower-class but operated by wealthy merchants, gained greater influence. The modern history of Korean criminal organizations can be divided into four periods: the Colonial era, the political mobs of the 1950s and early 1960s under president Syngman Rhee, the Civil War period under the military rule of Park Chung-hee and Chun Doo-hwan, and the present era.\n\nDuring the 35 years of when Korea under Imperial Japanese rule, some Koreans were subjected to forced labor and sex slavery. This intensified during World War II when the Empire of Japan spread its empire throughout Manchuria, and parts of China. During this period, Koreans fled to mainland Japan and formed mobs to overcome discrimination and crime. The most infamous \"mobster\" during this period was Kim Du-han, the son of a famous Korean independence fighter and insurgent leader Kim Chwa-chin, a freedom fighter against Colonial rule. After his mother and father were killed, Kim grew up as a beggar and became involved with a local gang named \"Jumok\" (\"fist\"). He rose through the ranks and became infamous for fighting groups against the Japanese mobs, or yakuza.\n\nThe colonial branch of the Imperial Japanese yakuza was then under the control of Hayashi, an ethnic Korean who defected to the Japanese and joined the yakuza. The rival mob to Hayashi's yakuza was controlled by Koo Majok, but the Korean mafia was always short of money and many local mob bosses were disloyal to Koo and formed separated mobs, notably Shin Majak and Shang Kal (\"twin knives\"). Koo Majok finally tried to solidify his control over the Korean mobs by knocking out Ssang Kal and taking over his territory, but it caused a backlash. Kim Du-han, originally a member of Ssang Kal, rebelled against Koo Majok. Kim killed both Shin Majok and Koo Majok, and unified all the Korean mobs under his command at the age of 18. After solidifying his rule by beating the revolting groups, Kim made his move against the yakuza, starting the famous trial war between \"Jumok\" and yakuza, which became symbolic of the resistance by Koreans against Japanese. Kim Du-han was a major figure of the movement against the colonial rule and later became a politician in Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party. To this date, many Korean mobs are still at war with yakuza.\n\nDuring the 1950s, two separate Seoul-based groups, the Myung-dong and the Chong-ro, operated to protect Korean merchants from Japanese criminals who were often protected by officials. The 1960s, however, saw a shutdown of nearly all gang activity as those groups were considered a problem by the regime.\n\nIt was not until the early 1970s that the modern Korean gangs began to emerge. Hierarchical structures began forming during this time, as well as the use of weapons such as knives and iron bars which culminated in more violent attacks. The 1980s was a flourishing period for gangsters, as they were able to infiltrate businesses and set up connections with in-house government and entertainment officials, as well as making ties with other global crime rings. \n\nThe early 1990s saw another periodic crackdown with Article 114 of Korean Criminal Law dictating that not only were organized gangs illegal, but those who joined or formed groups could also be charged. This new law forced many into hiding or fleeing, while many others were arrested, and even those who finished their time were often put under surveillance if they were deemed career criminals. However, Korea’s rapid globalization has it made it hard for law enforcement to completely stamp out organized crime, which continues to be a problem in the present day.\n\nGang members have been linked to crimes ranging from sex trafficking to drug smuggling and extortion. A survey in 2007 showed that 109 inmates jailed for organized criminal activities were all involved in extortion, mostly victimizing/running bars, nightclubs, and game rooms. Gangsters have also been used as hired muscle and strongmen for businesses, such as in the case of Kim Seung-youn, \"a conglomerate owner who hired gangsters to abduct and beat up employees of bar\". Assaults have become more common in recent years as seen in 2009, when out of 621 gang members, 35% were arrested for assault while extortion took second at 29%, and illegal gambling (11%) and loan sharking (7%) made up the rest. The number of gang members and affiliates jump in years of economic strain, as in the economic slump of 2009, when officials saw a 60% increase in new gang formations and activities. In 2011, police initiated a crackdown on gangs and affiliated members, rounding up 127 individuals within the first week of the \"war against organized crime\".\n\nSouth Korean mafiosi often have tattoos of the \"pa\" (English: \"mob\") they are in. When confronted by other mobs, they show their tattoos to help identify themselves. The tattoo can also be used as a warning to the general public. As a result, tattoos are often considered taboo in South Korean society.\n\nThe stereotypical image of the quintessential South Korean mafioso is one with a \"gakdoogi\" hairstyle, which consists of the sides of the head shaved, with hair remaining on top, a big build, dark, black clothing, tacky suits, black-painted luxury cars, prominent tattoos, and regional accents or dialects (Korean: \"Saturi\"). Contrary to popular belief, Seoul is not a known hotbed of South Korean mob presence. The most prominent organizations of the South Korean mafia operate in the Jeolla region, in cities such as Gwangju and Mokpo, with other South Korean mafiosi known to be operating in Busan and Incheon.\nFilms romanticizing \"kkangpae\" have featured in South Korean cinema since the 1970s, but gained a foothold in the market in the early 1990s (Jamier, 2015, p. 1)[1]. Such films emphasized traits like loyalty, decency, and morality against a backdrop of violence and corruption. The popularity of films like \"Friend\" (2001), \"A Bittersweet Life\" (2005), \"New World\" (2013) popularized the image of the identifiable and ‘honorable’ gangster (Jamier, 2015)[1].\n\nThe rise in gang-centered content in film and television has been linked to changes in the public perception of \"kkangpae\", particularly in teens and younger audiences. Some have linked this to the increase in school-yard gangs known as \"iljinhoe\", which may take cues from such movies in the form of intimidation and mental or physical abuse (2005, “School Gangs”)[2]. Youths may look up to \"kkangpae\" characters for their strength and intelligence outside of the restrictive classroom setting (2005, “School Gangs”)[2].\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39352523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39352523", "title": "La Sape", "text": "La Sape\n\nLa Sape, an abbreviation based on the phrase Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes Élégantes (French; literally \"Society of Ambiance-Makers and Elegant People\") and hinting to the French slang word \"sape\" which means \"attire\", is a subculture centered on the cities of Kinshasa and Brazzaville in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Republic of Congo respectively. An adherent of La Sape is known as a sapeur. The movement embodies the elegance in style and manners of colonial predecessor dandies.\n\n\"La sape\" can be traced back to the period of colonialism in Africa, and in particular Brazzaville and Kinshasa. The French mission was to civilize the \"uncouth\" and \"naked\" African people. They brought second hand clothing from Europe as a bargaining tool to gain the loyalty of the chiefs. Brazzaville soon became the \"most favored residential area for whites and the seat of colonial government.\" By the end of the 19th century their \"houseboys\" were the first to embrace European modernity because they would be given clothing instead of money as compensation for their work. The Congolese elite not only included the houseboys, but also those who held lower positions as clerks in colonial offices and other places.\n\nA major influence on the Congolese elite, present during the 1920s (the so-called Roaring Twenties), was West African colonial workers who came to the Congo. These Bapopo or Coastmen, as they were called, served as inspiration for the Congolese elite \"to combat ingrained charges of inferiority leveled at them\" by French and Belgian colonialism. Young Congolese men took the style of their masters’ and made it their own. In the historian Didier Gondola's essay titled \"La Sape Exposed!: High Fashion Among Lower-Class Congolese\", he says:\n\nThe houseboys used their connections in France to acquire their clothing. One colonist looked down on the habits her houseboys in Brazzaville because while they may have been half-starved, they would still don their expensive clothing once their monthly wages came in.\n\nAccording to Gondola, Camille Diata frontlined the sape movement in Brazzaville in the 1930s, but also had a deep influence in France. He was also part of L'Amicale, \"a loosely organized anti-colonial movement,\" formed in France in 1926 by the imaginative Congolese revolutionary André Matsoua. The organization mainly helped Africans new to Paris get settled in the city because they were not really welcomed by French, facing imprisonment and deportation. By the time of Matsoua death in 1942, his political developments gained prominence in the Congo and were \"hijacked\" by the Congolese intellectual elite. They not only adapted the fashion sense but also his anti-colonial views. This movement became a distinctly ethnic Bakongo and Balari one characterized by potent political symbolism and ideology that would manifest in postcolonial era.\n\nThe 1950s gave rise to the cosmopolitan, thus bringing prominence to the music scene. Nightclubs and beer halls made up the venues home to the music and young urbanites of the Congolese townships of Kinshasa and Brazzaville. La Sape was synonymous with the Congolese rumba scene that surfaced and which Papa Wemba, a Congolese musician, made music about the La Sape style. During the postcolonial years, the unique dynamics of La Sape coalesced in 1960 when both Congos were granted independence. Economic chaos ensued and many were left jobless. This caused numerous Congolese people to move abroad to western cities like London and Paris. Since they were also not very welcome, La Sape acted as refuge for them to cope with European life.\n\nCongolese dandies living in Paris and other European cities were only deemed sapeur once they returned to Brazzaville in the summer to showcase their style before the mid-1990s.\n\nAlthough war and strife had riddled the Congo over the years, there has been a revival of La Sape in Brazzaville. Whereas before in the early 1980s when campaigns were being prompted to bar La Sape from public spaces, they are now well respected and are \"darlings of the regime.\" They have been raised to a higher status of \"cultural heritage\" by Denis Sassou Nguesso by allowing them to participate in public cultural events like the African Exhibit of Fashion and Crafts (Salon africain de la mode et de l’artisanat).\n\nGondola argues that:\n\nIn an interview with David M. Ewalt, media theorist Henry Jenkins described the traditional cosmopolitan as someone who escapes the orbit of their own parochial culture through high culture and absorption of the values attached to that culture. This includes luxuries such as opera, ballet, paintings, etc. However, the pop cosmopolitan is the modern teenager. He used America to illustrate this point through teenagers today who learn, absorb, and interact with various facets of Asian cultures as a means of escaping the limitations of American culture. They use the Internet and technology to connect with other cultures. Social networks are a force toward globalization and it is this very connectivity that allows modern globalization to thrive.\n\nSapeurs are shown in a film \"35 Cows and a Kalashnikov\" (2014), directed by Oswald von Richthofen.\n\n\n"}

The term also refers to five Zen centers in China in Hangzhou and Ningpo that inspired zen in Japan, while the term \"mountain\" refers to Buddhist monastery. \n\nFive Mountains literature or \"gozan bungaku\" (五山文學) is used collectively to refer to the poetry and prose in Chinese produced by Japanese monks during the 14th and 15th centuries. Included are works by Chinese monks residing in Japan. The period witnessed a widespread importation of cultural influences from Song and Yuan period China that in many ways transformed Japan. \n\nThe literature of the Five Mountains highly prized a sense of humor and sympathy with life’s ordinariness. A Five Mountains poet might write about anything, in contrast to the proscribed themes of the aristocratic court poets. Kokan Shiren (d. 1346) for example would write about a mosquito.\nSnouts sharp as drill bits!<br>\nBuzz like thunder as they circle the room.<br>\nThey sneak through the folds of my robe,<br>\nBut they could bloody the back of an ox made of iron!\nThe image in the final line of \"Mosquitoes\" reminds the reader of one of the custom in Zen establishments of slapping on the head with a stick those practitioners of meditation who have momentarily dozed off. In contrast, a courtier might write about the cicada and celebrate seasonal associations connected to them. To write about the mosquito would violate the courtier’s strict sense of literary decorum.\n\nIn a poem entitled \"Sailing in the Moonlight\", Kokan focuses on the incongruous humor of life.\nWe monks boat in moonlight, circle through the reeds.<br>\nThe boatman shouts the tide recedes; we must return.<br>\nThe village folk mistake us for a fishing boat<br>\nAnd scramble to the beach to buy our catch.\n\nFive Mountains literature was not entirely concerned with the rustic cloistered world. Often the principal historical events of the day found their way into the works of the monks. Zen clerics themselves often served as advisers to the leading political figures. In a poem, \"Written Suddenly While Feeling Remorse Over the Passage of Time\" Chugan Engetsu (d. 1375) relates his feelings about the fall of the Kamakura shogunate a year earlier.\nA year ago today the Kamakura fell.<br>\nIn the monasteries now, nothing of the old mood remains.<br>\nThe peddler girl understands nothing of a monk's remorse-<br>\nShouting through the streets, selling firewood, selling vegetables.\n\n"}

Most rely on the notion that a worker's productivity declines significantly after age 70, and the mandatory retirement is the employer's way to avoid reduced productivity. However, since the age at which retirement is mandated is often somewhat arbitrary and not based upon an actual physical evaluation of an individual person, many view the practice as a form of age discrimination, or ageism.\n\nEconomist Edward Lazear has argued that mandatory retirement can be an important tool for employers to construct wage contracts that prevent worker shirking. Employers can tilt the wage profile of a worker so that it is below marginal productivity early on and above marginal productivity toward the end of the employment relationship. In this way, the employer retains extra profits from the worker early on, which he returns in the later period if the worker has not shirked his duties or responsibilities in the first period (assuming a competitive market).\n\nIn Australia, compulsory retirement is generally unlawful throughout the various State and Territory jurisdictions in Australia. However, there are some exemptions. For instance, permanent members of the Australian Defence Force must retire at the age of 60 and reservists at 65.\n\nSince the passage of a constitutional amendment in 1977, judges on federal courts are required to retire at the age of 70.\n\nThe Constitution of Brazil says in Article 40, Paragraph 1, Item II, that all public servants in the Union, States, Cities and the Federal District shall mandatorily retire at the age of 70. This regulation encompasses servants from the executive, legislative and judicial branches. It also applies to the Supreme Federal Court Justices, as per Article 93, Item VI, of the Constitution, and the Court of Accounts of the Union Judges, as stated in Article 73, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution (disposition added after the 20th Amendment).\n\nThe normal age for retirement in Canada is 65, but one cannot be forced to retire at that age. Labour laws in the country do not specify a retirement age. Age 65 is when federal Old Age Security pension benefits begin, and most private and public retirement plans have been designed to provide income to the person starting at 65 (an age is needed to select premium payments by contributors to be able to calculate how much money is available to retirees when they leave the program by retiring).\n\nAll judges in Canada are subject to mandatory retirement, at 70 or 75 depending on the court. Federal senators cease to hold their seats at 75.\n\nMandatory retirement of federally regulated employees is prohibited as of December 2012.\n\nIn October 2006 the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006, the UK Labour Government introduced a Default Retirement Age, whereby employers are able to terminate or deny employment to people over 65 without a reason. A legal challenge to this failed in September 2009, although a review of the legislation was expected in 2010 by the new Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government. This review has taken place and on 17 February 2011 BIS published the draft Regulations abolishing the Default Retirement Age. The draft Regulations were later revised and the final version was laid before Parliament on 1 March 2011. As of 6 April 2011, employers can no longer give employees notice of retirement under Default Retirement Age provisions and will need to objectively justify any compulsory retirement age still in place to avoid age discrimination claims.\n\nMandatory retirement is generally unlawful in the United States, except in certain industries and occupations that are regulated by law, and are often part of the government (such as military service and federal police agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation).\n\nFrom the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission website:\nFrom the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations discussing the Age Discrimination in Employment Act:\n\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Paul VI introduced a mandatory retirement age of 70 for priests and 75 for bishops and archbishops. There is no mandatory retirement age for cardinals nor for the pope, as they hold these positions for life, but cardinals age 80 or over are prohibited from participating in the papal conclave.\n\nFor the Anglican Communion clergy, they introduced the mandatory retirement age of 65 for priests and 70 for bishops and archbishops, five years younger than their Roman Catholic counterparts, as a result of changes imposed in the Protestant Reformation.\n\n"}

Its flagship initiative is the Millennium Villages Project, which highlights how integrated, community-led development, even in some of the poorest communities across rural sub-Saharan Africa, can lead to progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and can provide communities with the basic tools and necessities to break out of poverty, on the path toward self-sustainable development. Millennium Promise oversees the Millennium Villages Project in collaboration with the Earth Institute at Columbia University and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).\n\nThe project reflects Millennium Promise's focus on simultaneously addressing the inter-connected challenges of poverty - which include hunger and malnutrition, disease and lack of access to health care, poor education, and insufficient infrastructure, among others. The organization engages partners from the private and public sectors, national governments, and individuals in support of its work in the Millennium Villages and for a broader policy and advocacy agenda in support of the MDGs. As such, Millennium Promise recognizes the critical importance of partnerships in addressing the many dimensions of poverty. Among the Millennium Promise MDG Global Leaders are fashion icon Tommy Hilfiger, the founder of Diesel, Renzo Rosso, and Senegalese musician and UNICEF ambassador Youssou Ndour.\n\nA central goal of Millennium Promise, using the platform of the Millennium Villages Project, is to demonstrate the power of practical, low-cost and community-led approaches to poverty alleviation that can be replicated at scale by developing nations around the world. Through the Millennium Villages Project, Millennium Promise works in over 80 villages across ten different countries in sub-Saharan Africa — Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda. Each Millennium Village site is a cluster of a village or villages, of approximately 5,000 inhabitants per cluster.\n\nMillennium Promise was co-founded by the renowned international economist and Director of The Earth Institute at Columbia University, Professor Jeffrey Sachs, and philanthropist and Wall Street leader Ray Chambers in 2005. The organization is headquartered in New York, New York, with regional headquarters in Bamako, Mali and Nairobi, Kenya, and national affiliates in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Peter Neidecker is CEO of Millennium Promise. Prior to joining Millennium Promise, Mr. Neidecker served as the director of programs for the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation in London.\n\nIn September 2006, the financier and philanthropist George Soros pledged $50 million to Millennium Promise to fund 33 Millennium Villages. This donation has received added attention as a departure from Soros' characteristic sponsorship of democracy building and good governance-focused programs.\n\nResults published in May 2010 of three years of work from five of the Millennium Villages sites, in \"Harvests of Development in Rural Africa: The Millennium Villages after Three Years\", reported an average three-fold increase in maize yields, a seven-fold increase in access to basic sanitation, and an over 50% reduction in malaria prevalence, among other factors. On May 30, 2010, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon visited the Millennium Village of Mwandama, Malawi, and he stated: “I congratulate the leadership of the village and the whole community – especially the women of Mwandama – for their hard work and their commitment to a better life for their children and for generations to come... . Today, I call on every country to look closely at this success. It is a case study in what is possible, even in the poorest places in the world.”\n\nIn addition to the Millennium Villages Project, Millennium Promise also supports independent projects and initiatives to address extreme poverty. Millennium Promise is a founding partner of the organization Malaria No More. Launched in December 2006 at the White House Summit on Malaria, Malaria No More brings together corporations, foundations, faith-based groups, grassroots networks, and the public to support a comprehensive approach to control malaria. In 2010, Millennium Promise, in collaboration with the Earth Institute and Ericsson Mobile, founded a global education initiative called Connect To Learn, the focuses on bringing access to a 21st-century education - including secondary school - to all children, and in particular girls.\n\n"}

For each of these representations, there may exist different versions that correspond to the same musical work. The general goal of music alignment (sometimes also referred to as music synchronization) is to automatically link the various data streams, thus interrelating the multiple information sets related to a given musical work. More precisely, music alignment is taken to mean a procedure which, for a given position in one representation of a piece of music, determines the corresponding position within another representation. In the figure on the right, such an alignment is visualized by the red bidirectional arrows. Such synchronization results form the basis for novel interfaces that allow users to access, search, and browse musical content in a convenient way.\n\nGiven two different music representations, typical music alignment approaches proceed in two steps. In the first step, the two representations are transformed into sequences of suitable features. In general, such feature representations need to find a compromise between two conflicting goals. On the one hand, features should show a large degree of robustness to variations that are to be left unconsidered for the task at hand. On the other hand, features should capture enough characteristic information to accomplish the given task. For music alignment, one often uses chroma-based features (also called chromagrams or pitch class profiles), which capture harmonic and melodic characteristics of music, while being robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation, are being used.\n\nIn the second step, the derived feature sequences have to be brought into (temporal) correspondence. To this end, techniques related to dynamic time warping (DTW) or hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used to compute an optimal alignment between two given feature sequences.\n\nMusic alignment and related synchronization tasks have been studied extensively within the field of music information retrieval. In the following, we give some pointers to related tasks. Depending upon the respective types of music representations, one can distinguish between various synchronization scenarios. For example, audio alignment refers to the task of temporally aligning two different audio recordings of a piece of music. Similarly, the goal of score–audio alignment is to coordinate note events given in the score representation with audio data. In the offline scenario, the two data streams to be aligned are known prior to the actual alignment. In this case, one can use global optimization procedures such as dynamic time warping (DTW) to find an optimal alignment. In general, it is harder to deal with scenarios where the data streams are to be processed online. One prominent online scenario is known as score following, where a musician is performing a piece according to a given musical score. The goal is then to identify the currently played musical events depicted in the score with high accuracy and low latency. In this scenario, the score is known as a whole in advance, but the performance is known only up to the current point in time. In this context, alignment techniques such as hidden Markov models or particle filters have been employed, where the current score position and tempo are modeled in a statistical sense. As opposed to classical DTW, such an online synchronization procedure inherently has a running time that is linear in the duration of the performed version. However, as a main disadvantage, an online strategy is very sensitive to local tempo variations and deviations from the score - once the procedure is out of sync, it is very hard to recover and return to the right track. A further online synchronization problem is known as automatic accompaniment. Having a solo part played by a musician, the task of the computer is to accompany the musician according to a given score by adjusting the tempo and other parameters in real time. Such systems were already proposed some decades ago.\n"}

The main idea of MGT is that \"Language serves its creators better than those in other groups who have to learn to use the language as best they can.\" \n\nThe term “mutedness” refers to a group’s inability to express themselves due to this inequity. The theory describes the relationship between a dominant group and its subordinate group(s) as being as follows: 1) the dominant group contributes mostly to the formulation of the language system, including the social norms and vocabulary, and 2) members from the subordinate group have to learn and use the dominant language to express themselves. However, this translation process may result in the loss and distortion of information as the people from subordinate groups cannot articulate their ideas clearly. The dominant group may also ignore the voice of the marginalized group. All these may eventually lead to the mutedness of the subordinate group. Although this theory was initially developed to study the different situations faced by women and men, it can also be applied to any marginalized group that is muted by the inadequacies of their languages. \n\nMuted Group Theory was firstly developed in the field of cultural anthropology by the British anthropologist, Edwin Ardener. The first formulation of MGT emerges from one of Edwin Ardener's short essays, entitled \"Belief and the Problem of Women,\" in which Ardener explored the \"problem\" of women. In social anthropology, the problem of women is divided in two parts: technical and analytical. The technical problem is that although half of the population and society is technically made up of women, ethnographers have often ignored this half of the population. Ardener writes that \"those trained in ethnography evidently have a bias towards the kinds of model that men are ready to provide (or to concur in) rather than towards any that women might provide.\" He also suggests that the reason behind this is that men tend to give a \"bounded model of society\" akin to the ones that ethnographers are attracted to. Therefore, men are those who produce and control symbolic production in a society. This leads to the analytical part of the problem which attempts to answer the question: \"[…] if the models of society made by most ethnographers tend to be models derived from the male portion of that society, how does the symbolic weight of the other mass of persons express itself?\"\n\nAfter conducting an experiment with the information in his essay, the results indicated that the male point of view is the dominant point of view in society, which is why it is depicted with a standard solid line in this graph. On the other hand, the female point of view is considered as non-dominant and non-standard, so it falls into the muted category with the broken line. According to Ardener, because male-based understandings of society represent the dominant worldview, certain groups are silenced or muted. He writes: \"In these terms if the male perception yields a dominant structure, the female one is a muted structure.\" As part of the critical approach to the world, Ardener uses MGT to explore the power and societal structure in relation to the dynamism between dominant and subordinated groups. Moreover, Ardener's concept of muted groups does not only apply to women but can also be applied to other non-dominant groups within social structures.\n\nScholars Cheris Kramer, Barrie Thorne and Nancy Henley were interested in exploring ways language “defines, deprecrates, and ignores women”. What they discovered is that \"male dominance affects more than just the way sexes speak but the content and structure of the English language. Women are often defined by their relation to men (“Miss/Mrs.” or “Harold’s Widow”) while men have more autonomous varied linguistic status.\" \n\nMutedness does not equal silence. Mutedness occurs when people cannot articulate their ideas, regardless of time and space, without changing their language to meet the dominant group's vocabulary. Mutedness results from the lack of power and might lead to being overlooked, muffled, and invisible. As gender communication scholar Cheris Kramarae states, social interaction and communication create the current language structure. Because the latter was mainly built by men, men have an advantage over women. Consequently, women cannot express their thoughts through their own words because their language use is limited by the rules of a man's language. Kramarae states:\n\n\"The language of a particular culture does not serve all its speakers equally, for not all speakers contribute in an equal fashion to its formulation. Women (as well as members of other non-dominant groups) are not as free or as able as men are to say what they wish, because the words and the norms for their use have been formulated by the dominant group, men.\"\n\nAs Cowan points out, \" 'mutedness' does not refer to the absence of voice but to a kind of distortion where subordinate voices…are allowed to speak but only in the confines of the dominant communication system.\"\n\nMuted group or subordinated group is relative to the dominant group. According to Gerdrin, muting or silencing is a social phenomenon based on the tacit understanding that within a society there are dominant and non-dominant groups. Thus, the muting process is a socially shared phenomenon that presupposes a collective understanding of who is in power and who is not. The discrepancies in power result in the \"oppressor\" and \"the oppressed\". Kramarae points out that muted group as \"the oppressed\" are people who don't have a \"public recognized vocabulary\" to express their experience. Their failure in articulate their ideas lead to their doubt about \"the validity of their experience\" and \"the legitimacy of their feelings\". Kramarae also addresses that gender, race, and class hierarchies, where muted groups, are supported by our \"political, educational, religious, legal, and media systems\". Due to the lack of power, muted groups are usually at the margin of the society.\n\nSeveral scholars have researched and studied how the \"muting\" process occurs. Houston and Kramarae posit that women have been silenced in many ways by for example ridiculing women's related lexicon, reinforcing family hierarchies, constructing a male-controlled media, trivializing their opinions, ideas, and concerns, and censoring women's voices. A central factor that contributes to these silencing methods is the trivialization of the lexicon and speech patterns that is often used to describe female activities.\n\nAccording to West and Turner (2010), individuals can use the following strategies to avoid the \"muting\" process: \n\nAccording to Cheris Kramarae, MGT makes three assumptions :\n\n\"The different experiences caused by the division of labor result in the different perceptions that women and men hold towards the world\"\n\nUsing men's words is a disadvantage to women because Kramarae believes that men and women are vastly different and thus will view the world differently from each other. This stems from the distinction between the meanings of the words \"sex\" and \"gender\". Kramerae believes that communication between men and women is not on an even level. This is because language is man made. This makes it easier for men to communicate over women. Symbolic Interactionism Theory believes that \"the extent of knowing is the extent of naming.\" When applied to muted group, this means women have an extreme disadvantage over men because men are the namers.\n\n\"Women find it difficult to articulate their ideas as men's experience are dominant\"\n\nKramarae argues that English is a \"[hu]man-made language\" and that it \"embodies the perspectives of the masculine more than the feminine\", while supporting \"the perceptions of white middle-class males. Men are the standard.\" In other words, Kramerae argues that men use language to dominate women, so that women's voices become less present, or \"muted\". Kramarae also explains that men's control over language has produced an abundance of derogatory words for women and their speech patterns. Some of these include names such as \"slut\", \"whore\", and \"easy lay\", along with speech patterns such as \"gossiping\", \"whining\", and \"bitching\". When it comes to words connoting promiscuity, there are fewer male-specific terms and the ones that do exist are seen in a positive/sexual light. These include words such as \"stud\", \"player\", and \"pimp\" (p. 465). Kramarae suggests these harmful words shape our reality. She believes that \"words constantly ignored may eventually come to be unspoken and perhaps even unthought\". This can lead women to doubt themselves and the intentions of their feelings. Women are at a disadvantage once again.\n\n\"Women have to go through a translation process when speaking in order to participate in social life\"\n\nKramarae says that women need to choose their words carefully in public. According to Kramarae, this is because, \"what women want to say and can say best cannot be said easily because the language template is not of their own making.\" Another example of the male-dominated language Kramarae brings up is that in public speaking, women most often use sports and war analogies (things most women do not usually associate themselves with) in order to relate to their male audiences. This stems from the market being dominated by males for so long. Almost all prominent authors, theorists, and scientists have historically been male. This allows for them to give women the \"facts\" they should believe about society and life in general. Kramarae also believes that \"males have more difficulty than females in understanding what members of the other gender mean.\" Feminist scholar Dale Spender supports the idea that language, and society in general, is traditionally male-centric. \"Masculinity is the unmarked form: the assumption is that the world is male unless proven otherwise. Femininity is the marked form: it is the proof of otherwise.\" If masculinity, and subsequently language, are unmarked forms, than any marked form must go through a translation process in order to participate in social life.\n\nAccording to Kissack, traditionally communication has been constructed within the framework of a male dominated society. Women in corporate organizations are expected to use language associated with women, that is, \"female-preferential\" language. It has been considered as lower than the \"male-preferential\" language. The primary difference between the two is \"male-preferential\" language consists of details such as opinions and facts whereas \"female-preferential\" language consists mainly of personal details, emotions reflected in the conversations, also there is a great use of adjectives in it.\n\nMuted group theory has \"recognized that women's voices are muted in Western society so that their experiences are not fully represented in language and has argued that women's experiences merit linguistic recognition\". Kramarae states that in order to change muted group status we also need to change dictionaries. Traditional dictionaries rely on the majority of their information to come from male literary sources. These male sources have the power to exclude words important to or created by women. Furthering this idea, Kramarae and Paula Treichler created A Feminist Dictionary with words they believed Merriam-Webster defined on male ideas. For example, the word \"Cuckold\" is defined as \"the husband of an unfaithful wife\" in Merriam Webster. However, there is no term for a wife who has an unfaithful husband. She is simply called a wife. Another example Kramarae defined was the word \"doll\". She defined \"doll\" as \"a toy playmate given to, or made by children\". Some adult males continue their childhood by labeling adult female companions \"dolls\". The feminist dictionary includes up to 2,500 words to emphasize women's linguistic ability and to give women words of empowerment and change their muted status. Long argues that words can shape reality and feelings. She also believes that women can grab opportunities to take up physical and political space if they are given more verbal space.\n\nAccording to Kramarae, women have been locked out of the publishing business until 1970; thus they lacked influence on mass media and have often been misrepresented in history. The reason behind this lies in the predominance of male gatekeepers, who are defined as editors and other arbiters of a culture who determine which books, essays, poetry, plays, film scripts, etc. will appear in the mass media. Similarly, Pamela Creedon argues that in the mid-70s there is an increase of women in the male-dominated profession of journalism.\n\nIn The Status of Women in the U.S. Media 2014, The Women's Media Centre researchers explore the current status of women in the mass media industry. The report compiles 27,000 pieces of content among \"20 of the most widely circulated, read, and viewed, and listened TV networks, newspapers, news wires, and online news in the United States.\" The results show that women (36.1%) are significantly out-numbered by men (63.4%). Although the number of women on TV news broadcasts is generally growing, the misrepresentation of women does not only regard their presence as anchors but also the events that they cover. Several studies show that while men mainly report on \"hard\" news, women are often relegated to cover \"soft\" news. Thus, women are often muted in terms of the topics they tend to cover.\n\nAlthough the Women's Media Centre study is very U.S.-centric, non-dominant groups are often muted even in other country's media landscapes. For example, Aparna Hebbani and Charise-Rose Wills have explored how Muslim women have often been muted in the Australian mass media sphere. Their study shows that women that wear a hijab or burqa are often inaccurately and negatively connoted in Australian mass media. According to the authors, Muslim women represent a muted group and thus cannot entirely incorporate their experiences, views, and perspective in their representation in Australian media. Thus, there is a social hierarchy that is privileging certain groups via Australian mass media. It also shows that although currently muted, this group is attempting to gain a voice in this media landscape by engaging and interacting with members of the dominant culture in order to negotiate their silenced position.\n\nThere are some conventional stereotypes attached to men and women in society when an individual's behavior deviates from this norm they attain \"negative feedback\" for this opposition to the norm by their actions. In the case of women, this gets quite complicated as women are told to act in a certain manner, but when they do try and emulate their male counterparts, they are \"discriminated\" and \"discouraged\" for acting that way.\n\nSocial rituals are another example of a place in which the muting process takes place. Kramarae suggests that many elements within wedding ceremonies place women in a silenced position. For example, the fact that the father of the bride \"gives her away\" to the groom, that the position of the bride – at the left of the minister – is considered less privileged than the one of the groom, that the groom announces his vows first, and that the groom is asked to kiss the bride, are all factors that contribute to the position of a woman as subordinated to the one of the man.\n\nAs Catharine MacKinnon (one of the leading voices in the feminist legal movement ) suggests, the law sees women similarly as men see women. Like language, the legal system has thus been created, defined, and interpreted mostly by men. In the context of unequal power relations between men and women, MacKinnon proposes new standards to define and evaluate sexual harassment and sex-related issues considered as the consequence of unwanted impositions of sexual requirements. Finley argues that there has been a recent interest in feminist jurisprudence and legal scholarship inspired by the law's failure to see that despite the legal removal of barriers, sexes are not socially equal.\n\nIn 1940s America, women entered the workplace in great numbers while men were at war. However, after the war period, the society did not encourage the participation of women in the workplace, and in this way tried to assert male dominance in the society. Organizations still appear to be male dominated. Women's experiences are often not taken into account in the workplace the way male experiences are. The \"structure\" is maintained by men who primarily use communication from the male perspective.\n\nMost organization goals are met by the usage of \"male-preferential\" language, as they tend to focus on aspects such as \"economic gain\" and \"performance improved\". The main point of organizational communication is that it can help an employee fulfill their work duties. Women are not able to fulfill these duties using language more relevant to them, so in order to attain success in their workplace, they have to go beyond their natural realm and utilize \"male-preferential\" language.\n\nOne of the ways that women are differentiated can be observed when we take the \"performance appraisals\" into consideration. What they mainly consist of is reviews that are based on the standards that are more like \"masculine\" standards. Research points to muted groups having little to no sense of agency, dominant emotions, and can point to the employee’s role in the silencing.\n\nOne member of the subordinate group that is also silenced in the workplace are women who face sexual harassment by the dominant group. Many women have a hard time when faced with harassment in a male dominated workplace because they are \"the verbal minority\". Organizations rarely encourage issues of sexual harassment be discussed openly and call for confidentiality when dealing with complaints. Furthermore, women rarely go through formal channels of reporting sexual harassment for a number of reasons to include: \"expecting their compliant to be ignored or trivialized by the male dominant group, fear of not being protected from retaliation, worry that the male dominated hierarchy will 'team up' against them, or that their time will be wasted due to the organizations ineffective sexual harassment policy.\" Those from the subordinate groups are trusted less than white men in the workplace and in general. \n\nThe classroom can be a place where women are muted. Women's education in the United States has progressed over the years, but academia is still male-dominated. Kramarae has raised several suggestions for more inclusive educational environments, such as including \"women's humor\", \"speechlessness\", and ways to address the issue of \"abusive language\". Including more diverse language systems in academia can keep it from being dominated by one way of thinking.\n\nIn the classroom, men and women utilize language differently. The bond differently with other members of their gender. Women tend to bond with each other through the process of discussing their problems, while men bond with each other using \"playful insults\" and \"put downs\". In the event of classroom discussions, men tend to believe that they are supposed to dominate the class discussion while women avoid dominating the discussions.\n\nHouston believes in order to create a positive reform in education it might be useful to revise the curriculum and lay special stress on \"woman-centered communication\" education. Women's Studies (WS) has evolved and grown over the years. Today there is greater demand for faculty to be on initiatives such as WS programs, African American Programs, and other programs focused on marginalized groups.\n\nIndependent parties have emerged since World War II to offer people alternative choices for election. However, most of these parties operate only in \"circumscribed regions or with very narrow platforms\". Prentice studied the impact of the third party, i.e., candidates from non-major parties, in public debate. He finds out that there have been few studies around third party by 2003 and even though third party candidates are involved in public campaign debates, they remain inarticulate and ignored due to the judgment by \"standard of the political rhetoric and worldview of the major parties\".\n\nPrentice points out that major parties usually interfere with the free expression of third parties through three ways: \"ignoring their claims, appearing confused (verbally or nonverbally) by the claims, or actively attacking the claims made\". He also notices that the debate questions are structured in a way that reflects major parties' worldviews, which results in third party's mutedness. In order to participate and articulate their own worldview, third party candidates have to transform their ideas to match the major parties' models through emphasizing the agreements with the majority rather than the differences and sometimes may lead them to make statements that can be misinterpreted.\n\nLGBT groups are considered marginalized and muted in our society. The dominant groups who \"hold privileged positions within society\" have developed social norms that marginalize LGBT groups. Although LGBT individuals do not necessarily share the same identity, they share similar experiences of being marginalized by the dominant groups. As Gross notes, \"For many oppressed groups the experience of commonality is largely the commonality of their difference from, and oppression by, the dominant culture\". In order to function and achieve success within the dominant culture, LGBT groups must adopt certain communication strategies to match the social norms.\n\nGloria Ladson-Billings believes that \"stories provide the necessary context for understanding, feeling, and interpreting\" and argues that voices of dispossessed and marginalized groups such as people of color are muted within the dominant culture. Critical race theorists try to bring the marginalized group's viewpoint to the forefront through an encouragement of \"naming one's own reality\". Delgado addresses three reasons for \"naming one's own reality\" in legal discourse: \"1) much of 'reality' is socially constructed; 2) stories provide members of outgroups a vehicle for psychic self-preservation; and 3) the exchange of stories from teller to listener can help overcome ethnocentrism and the dysconscious drive or need to view the world in one way\".\n\nWhen it comes to education, critical race theorists argue that the official school curriculum is designed to maintain a \"White supremacist master script\". As Swartz contends, master scripting sets the standard knowledge for students, which legitimizes \"dominant, white, upper-class, male voices\" and mutes multiple perspectives. The voices from other non-dominant groups are under control, mastered and can only be heard through reshaping and translation to meet the dominant standard. Therefore, Lasdon-Billing argues that the curriculum should be race-neutral or colorblind, present people of color, and \"presume a homogenized 'we' in a celebration of diversity\".\n\nAgeism leads to certain age groups being muted in American society. In particular, the elderly are often ignored and marginalized.\n\nIn \"Muted lives: Older battered women\", Carol Seaver discusses how older abused women are silenced because of sexism and ageism. She focuses on issues specific to elderly abused women, not just abused women in general. She argues that this group of domestic abuse survivors faces a specific set of difficulties, \"They are silenced by ageist assumptions about them as too resistant and hopeless to change or made invisible by the notion that very frail elders are the only victims of elder abuse.\" Here, age intersects with gender to create a specific kind of muted group. In \"Muted groups in health communication policy and practice: The case of older adults in rural and frontier areas\", Deborah Ballard-Reisch examines how and why elderly populations in the rural areas of Nevada and Kansas are considered muted health communication groups. Ageism, as well as other factors, result in this community being muted.\n\nAging populations, as seen in Seaver and Ballard-Reisch's works, can be silenced by stereotypes, such as the idea that the elderly are resistant to change.\n\nIssues of ageism intersect with heterosexism when looking at how aging LGBT community members are silenced. Scholar Maria T. Brown writes, \"The exclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) elders from queer and gerontological theories has resulted in the silencing of LGBT older adults and their experiences.\" Brown claims that the silencing is a \"rhetorical move\" that excludes the elderly from queer theory and queerness from the field gerontology. This case study is an example of how identities intersect (in this case, being elderly and part of the LGBT community). MGT can apply to both of these identities and intersections.\n\nMarcel Calvez argues that, \"What makes a social group muted is that claims of its members to participate into social life are discounted and that they have internalised the idea that they are not entitled to raise their voice.\" By this logic, he says that those with intellectual disabilities are muted. Calvez's study examines the experiences of those with intellectual disabilities, with special attention to the fact these groups are often marginalized and silenced.\n\nMany disabled groups are silenced by the dominant abled group that knowingly or unknowingly exclude them. The means of muting, ridicule, ritual, control, and harassment can all apply to disabled groups. Ableist language, such as use of the pejorative term \"retard\", can be used to ridicule disabled groups. By bringing attention to the use of pejoratives and how they affect certain communities, disabled individuals and abled allies can raise awareness about their harm.\n\nTo get their concerns recognized by the dominant group, the subordinate groups take on language and communication styles of the dominant group. There are particularly stringent demands on the performances by members of \"inferior\" groups when they communicate with persons from the dominant group. Orbe (1994) identified six themes central to African American male communication: \"(1) the importance of other African Americans, (2) learning how to communicate with non-African Americans, (3) keeping a safe distance, (4) playing the part (snap!), (5) testing the sincerity of non-African Americans, and (6) an intense social responsibility.\" Respondents in Orbe’s research were observed changing immediately into two different people, in order to play the part, when communicating with non-African Americans.  \n\nIn addition to African American men feeling as though they need to communicate differently with White men, African American women also feel pressure to conform to the dominant language. A speaker’s dialect (e.g. Black English or Mainstream American English) is most heavily influenced by his or her place in the social hierarchy, for example, the speaker’s socio-economic status, educational status, provenance, and/or racial/ethnic origin. As a result, African American women find themselves needing to “code-switch” when communicating with the dominant group.\n\nMGT offers ways to change the muting status quo, i.e., naming the strategies of silencing, reclaiming, elevating and celebrating women's discourse, and creating new languages based on the experience of the marginalized group.\n\nWomen as a muted group recognize the ways in which women are silenced both interpersonally and societally, but also stress the ways that they resist being silenced such as labeling and talking about problems that are usually ignored in the dominant discourse (Vonnegut 1992). Specifically, with the creation of the Feminist Theory to understand the nature of gender inequality. Additionally, in the last year, the international movement against sexual harassment and assault with the Me Too Movement are other examples of strategies of resistance against the dominant group.\n\nAlthough the muted group theory has been mainly developed as a feminist theory, it can also be applied to other silenced groups in society. Mark Orbe, a communication theorist, has suggested that in the U.S. the dominant group consists of white, heterosexual, middle-class, males. Thus, groups that distinguish themselves from the dominant one in terms of race, age, gender, sexual orientation, and economic status can potentially be silenced or muted.\n\nIn \"African-American communication research: Toward a deeper understanding of interethnic communication\" (1995) and \"Constructing co-cultural theory: An explication of culture, power, and communication\" (1998), Orbe fleshed out two important extensions of muted group theory:\n\nTherefore, although Kramarae focuses on women's muted voices, she also opens the door to the application of muted group theory to issues beyond gender differences. Orbe not only applies this theoretical framework to a different muted group, i.e. African-Americans, but also contributes by assessing \"how individual and small collectives work together to negotiate their muted group status.\"\n\nOrbe regards \"interactions among underrepresented and dominant group members\" as co-cultural communication. He argues that there are three preferred outcomes in the co-cultural communication process: \"assimilation (e.g., becoming integrated into mainstream culture), accommodation (gaining acceptance and space in a society and achieving cultural pluralism without hierarchy), or separation (maintaining a culturally distinct identity in intercultural interactions.\" He also notes three communication approaches: \"nonassertive (when individuals are constrained and nonconfrontational, putting the needs of others first to avoid conflicts), assertive (when individuals express feelings, ideas, and rights in ways that consider the needs of themselves and others), or aggressive (when individuals express feelings, ideas, and rights in ways that ignore the needs of others).\" The different combinations of the three preferred outcomes and three communication approaches result in nine communication orientations.\n\nFurther, although various groups can be considered as muted within society, silenced and dominant groups can also exist within any group. For example, Anita Taylor and M. J. Hardman posit that feminist movements can also present dominant subgroups that mute other groups within the same movement. Thus, members within oppressed groups can have diverse opinions and one can become dominant and further mute the others.\n\nEdwin Ardener saw that MGT had pragmatic as well as analytical potentials. Edwin Ardener always maintained that MGT was not only, or even primarily, about women - although women comprised a conspicuous case in point. In fact, he also drew on his personal experience as a sensitive (intellectual) boy among hearty (sportive) boys in an all boys London secondary school. As a result of his early encounters with other boys, he identified with other groups in society for whom self-expression was constrained.\n\nMGT has often been challenged. Deborah Tannen, the theorist that created Genderlect Theory, criticizes feminist scholars like Kramarae for assuming that men are trying to control women. Tannen acknowledges that differences in male and female communication styles sometimes lead to imbalances of power, but unlike Kramarae, she is willing to assume that the problems are caused primarily by men and women's different styles. Tannen warns readers that \"bad feelings and imputation of bad motives or bad character can come about when there was no intention to dominate, to wield power\". Kramerae thinks Tannen's opinion is naïve. She believes men belittle and ignore women whenever they speak out against being muted. She also pointed out that \"our political, educational, religious, legal, and media systems support gender, race, and class hierarchies\". Both theorists believe muting is involved, but they see it from different standpoints.\n\nIs MGT outdated? In the 1970s and 1980s, MGT challenged the status quo, of academia, at least. While many women reading and discussing the theory thought it made sense in their own lives, many other academics thought it wasn't proper, both theoretically and politically. It certainly wasn't like any of the theories in introductory communication texts at the time. It was considered radical. If MGT isn't as exciting as it once seemed, this is due in part to its success and the success of theories and actions related to it.\n\nThere are many theories that appear to be related to Muted Group Theory. These include but are not limited to:\n\n"}

Bosnian organised crime figures operate mostly in Europe. Bosnian organised-crime groups are involved in a wide range of activities and extortion is (often under the cover of ostensible security and insurance companies) . Smuggling revenues are between €600 million and €900 million.\n\nThe Bosnian mafia can be broadly divided into four categories – the Bosniak mafia, the Bosnian Serb mafia, the Bosnian Croat mafia and many local organised-crime groups. The Bosnian mafia groups are involved in a wide range of activities; one of their more notorious activities occurred in 2003 when they smuggled and sold 250,000 Zastava M70 Yugoslav-made AK-47s to Iraq.\n\nThe federalist government of Bosnia and Herzegovina makes fighting organised-crime groups extremely difficult. Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of two largely independent entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska – both of which have their own capital, parliament, president and police force. Due to the poor cooperation between law-enforcement agencies in the two regions, criminals can often evade prosecution simply by moving from one to the other. Mafia groups from neighbouring countries (particularly Serbia and Croatia) often base their operations in Sarajevo, due to its proximity to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nHowever, there have been some efforts to increase collaboration between the two regions. In 2006 the European Union established the State Investigation and Protection Agency. SIPA is a Bosnian federal police agency with authority in both regions, and is under the direct administration of the Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH MIS).\n\n\n"}

The old Freemasons Lodge in Oslo was renovated in 1989, but housed similar events in Christiania throughout the 19th century attended by some of Norway's most famous composers and artists - such as Edvard Grieg, Halfdan Kjerulf, Johan Svendsen, etc. Participants have first attended an Opera performance at the national opera house, then walk in a costume or carnival procession with horse-drawn carts through the historical centre of Oslo to the historical former freemasons Lodge. Then follows parallel performances and dance in up to six different halls with several orchestras and groups of musicians. All participants are invited to two evenings of rehearsals in historical dances, such as the menuett, mazurka, francaise, lanciers, galopp and so forth. Lectures and information evenings inform about the period, culture and attires chosen as theme for the event.\n\nThe annual series have historical precedents since the 1850s in the same hall. There were annual masquerade balls in the Old Freemasons lodge, by the student association and later also by the artist association in the carnival season in Christiania. These traditions are closesly related to the present Operaball in Oslo. Several compositions have been written for these events, notably Johan Svendsens Festival Polonaise. Edvard Grieg has performed and held concerts in the freemasons lodge and one piano composition is called At the carnival. \n\nThe present series were initiated by Bjørn Einar Sakseid. His first full-scale ball required roccoco costumes with Mozart style wigs, powder, and white stockings.\nAfter the restoration and reopening of the old Freemasons Lodge, this ball series has been the largest event in this hall. The capacity is 600 people. After a gala performance a procession walks a historical route through the city streets Count to Wedel's Square and the freemasons Lodge. From 1988-2006 the performance was at the Norwegian Opera in Folketeaterbygningen, the new Opera House in Bjørvika opened in 2008. In 2007 and 2011 a mini-opera was held in the old freemasons Lodge.\n\nOperaballs have alternately been called Roccoco Ball, Mozart Ball, masquerade or Mask Balls, in 1992 it was a Leap Year Ball on 29 February. In 1998, there was an Operaball on Valentine's Day, with the Orchestra playing A midsummer Night's dream by Mendelssohn, and in 1993 there was also a Christiania Soirée, where the organizers held the first public ball at Akershus fortress since the Middle Ages.\nBjørn Einar \"Mozart\" Sakseid\nThe organizers of the Operaballs were first private initiatives by Bjørn Einar Sakseid with Christopher Brown (1988) and Tormod Carlsen (1989) among students at the University of Oslo. In 1990 the ball was part of the student week of the Norwegian student society led by Beatrice Johnson, from 1991 it was fronted by Jo Siri Ekgren and Signe Marie Hernes and in 1992 the Association Tårnseilerne (swift) was founded. In addition to the ball at the Old Freemasons lodge there have been balls in the Roccoco Halls at the Grand Hotel in Oslo in 1988, a Palace Ball at Akershus Castle in 1993 and a Fairytale Ball at Holmenkollen Park Hotel in 1995. The leader of the Operaballs (2004–2011), Gjørill Songvoll, received the City of Oslo's Culture Prize in 2010.\n\nThe Operaball in Oslo has inspired several similar balls, notably by the student society in Trondheim, the Jyske Opera in Denmark, the Opera house in Rostock, Germany and Copenhagen Opera House. These have visited, referred to and invited members of the Operaballs in Oslo to similar events. The Jutland Opera (den Jyske Opera) has organized several masquerade balls after visiting the Oslo Opera Ball and with participation from Oslo, with a masked Ball held on 5 February 2005. The first mask ball in Copenhagen modeled after the Operaball in Oslo was held on 18 February 2005 in the Royal Theatre and Molktes Palé.\n\nOpera balls have held annual courses in costume sewing, costume managers have been Bente Iben Sandvik (1989–90), munkedamene with Emmy Gram, Stine Aasheim and Anne Solli (1991–93), Olaug Berg (1994–1998), Elizabeth Driveklepp and Anita Landre.\n\n"}
{"id": "905119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=905119", "title": "Overlock", "text": "Overlock\n\nAn overlock is a kind of stitch that sews over the edge of one or two pieces of cloth for edging, hemming, or seaming. Usually an overlock sewing machine will cut the edges of the cloth as they are fed through (such machines being called \"sergers\" in North America), though some are made without cutters. The inclusion of automated cutters allows overlock machines to create finished seams easily and quickly. An overlock sewing machine differs from a lockstitch sewing machine in that it uses loopers fed by multiple thread cones rather than a bobbin. Loopers serve to create thread loops that pass from the needle thread to the edges of the fabric so that the edges of the fabric are contained within the seam.\n\nOverlock sewing machines usually run at high speeds, from 1000 to over 9000 rpm, and most are used in industry for edging, hemming and seaming a variety of fabrics and products. Overlock stitches are extremely versatile, as they can be used for decoration, reinforcement, or construction.\n\nOverlocking is also referred to as \"overedging\", \"merrowing\", or \"serging\". Though \"serging” technically refers to overlocking with cutters, in practice the four terms are used interchangeably.\n\nOverlock stitching was invented by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.\n\nJ. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements to be used in the mill’s operations. Merrow's first patent was a machine for crochet stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces crochet machines based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger.\n\nA landmark lawsuit between Willcox & Gibbs and the Merrow Machine Company in 1905 established the ownership and rights to the early mechanical development of overlocking to the Merrow Machine Company.\n\nThroughout the early 20th Century, the areas of Connecticut, USA and New York, USA were the centers of textile manufacturing and machine production. Consequently, many overlock machine companies established themselves in the Northeastern United States.\n\nIn 1964 several engineers and managers at one Japanese manufacturer redesigned the industrial serger they were currently manufacturing as a smaller, lighter model intended for home use. They presented their concept to their employer, and after it was rejected they quit and formed the Juki Corporation.\n\nNick Tacony, founder of Tacony Corporation, introduced machinery for producing the overlock stich (so called \"baby lock\") to the United States market. This allowed sewing enthusiasts to produce clothing with finishing seams like those made by industrial garment manufacturers.\n\nIn the United States, the term \"overlocker\" has largely been replaced by \"serger\". However, in other parts of the world such as Australia and the UK, the term \"overlocker\" is still in use.\n\nOverlock stitches are classified in a number of ways. The most basic classification is by the number of threads used in the stitch. Industrial overlock machines are generally made in 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 thread formations. Each of these formations has unique uses and benefits:\n\n\nTwo- and three-thread formations are also known as \"merrowing\" after the Merrow Machine Company.\n\nAdditional variables in the types of overlock stitches are the stitch eccentric, and the stitch width. The stitch eccentric indicates how many stitches per inch there are, which is adjustable and can vary widely within one machine. Different stitch eccentrics create more or less dense and solid-looking edges. The stitch width indicates how wide the stitch is from the edge of the fabric. Lightweight fabrics often require a wider stitch to prevent pulling.\n\nAdding extra variation in stitch types is the differential feed feature, which allows feed to be adjusted; extra-fast feed creates a ruffled or \"lettuce-leaf\" effect. Finally, some merrowing machines contain parts to roll the fabric edge into the stitch for added durability.\n\n\nOverlock stitches are traditionally used for edging and light seaming. Other applications include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11388020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11388020", "title": "Panzootic", "text": "Panzootic\n\nA panzootic (from Greek παν \"pan\" all + ζόιον \"zoion\" animal) is an epizootic (an outbreak of an infectious disease of animals) that spreads across a large region (for example a continent), or even worldwide. The equivalent in human populations is called a pandemic.\n\nA panzootic can start when three conditions have been met:\n\n\nA disease or condition is not a panzootic merely because it is widespread or kills a large number of animals; it must also be infectious. For example, cancer is responsible for a large number of deaths but is not considered a panzootic because the disease is, generally speaking, not infectious. Unlike an epizootic, a panzootic covers all or nearly all\nspecies over a large surface area (ex. rabies, anthrax). Typically an enzootic or an epizootic, or\ntheir cause, may act as a potential preparatory factor .\n\nContagion and infection by far play the biggest role in the\ndissemination and spread of epizootic and panzootic diseases. These include\nvirulent (ex. Cattle Plague), septic (can be caused in the change in food\nquality), parasitic (ex. Scabies), and miasmatic infections (ex. Typhoid Fever).\nMany claim that an accidental morbific cause, which infects a great number of\nanimals which ceases activity after a prolonged time period.\n\nCertain factors come into play in the spread of certain\npanzootic diseases, as can be seen with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This infection\nseems to be sensitive to external conditions, particularly the environments temperature\nand moisture. These factors leads to limitations on where the diseases can\nthrive, acting almost as its ‘climate niche’.\n\nH5N1, the highly pathogenic strain of influenza, was first detected in the goose population of Gaungdong, China in 1996.\n\nIn February 2004, avian influenza virus was detected in birds in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal.\n\nIn October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain H5N1) were identified in Turkey. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: \"We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus. There is a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia, Mongolia and China.\" Cases of bird flu were also identified shortly thereafter in Romania, and then Greece. Possible cases of the virus have also been found in Croatia, Bulgaria and in the United Kingdom. However, by the end of October only 67 people had died as a result of H5N1 which was atypical of previous influenza pandemics.\n\nThe enzooicity of H5N1 in birds, poultry in particular, has led to a major panzootic. As of 2012, there was an estimated 400 million birds killed from infection of the H5N1 strain of influenza. Studies have shown that H5N1 is very well adapted to domestic duck and geese, making them key in controlling the H5N1 strain and preventing future panzootic events.\n\nPresently, the highly pathogenic Asian strain of Avian Influenza is still continuing to kill poultry and wild birds alike on panzootic scales. The persistence of such a pathogen in the environment would only lead to a further continuation of panzootic scale eliminations of birds. To try to control this, scientists did research involving the shed feathers of domestic ducks to test the prevalence of H5N1. Although viral persistence was notably found within drinking water and feces, the feathers exhibited the most remaining H5N1 strain for up to 160 days. The persistence exhibited through the feathers indicates the potential for environmental contamination of not only H5N1, but also other untested viruses.\n\nWhite Nose Syndrome (WNS) is a rapidly spreading fungal infection responsible for killing millions of bats within the past 9 years.\"Geomyces-destructans\" is the causative fungal agent of the characteristic skin lesions seen on the exposed skin, particularly on wings and nose, and in the hair follicles of affected bats. WNS has only recently been discovered, in Howe's Cave, New York during the winter of 2006-2007, but affects 25% of the hibernating species. Six species of bats have been fatally effected by this panzootic; big brown bat, small-footed bat, little brown bat, northern long-eared bat, Indiana bat, and tricolored bat, and current bat population surveys suggest a 2-year population decline in excess of 75%. The geographical range of WNS has spread throughout 33 states, and 4 Canadian provinces.\n\nThe mechanism of how the infection on the skin kills bats is unclear. However, the outward cause of mortality of the infected bats depends on the stage and severity of the bat. Infected bats commonly die from starvation over winter, and can suffer from lasting damage to the wing membranes and impair summer foraging if survived the winter. One of the most abundant bat species in eastern North America, the little brown bat (\"Myotis lucifugus\"), could disappear from this region within 16 years.\n\nSeverely infected bats emerge prematurely from hibernation, and if they survive long enough and enter a different hibernaculum, the likelihood of transmission is probably high, because they presumably carry a large load of fungal spores. Transmission of the infection is either physically from bat-to-bat contact, or from and hibernaculum-to-bat, through the exposure to spores of \"Geomyces- destructans\" that were present on a roosting substrate.\n\nNewcastle disease is a contagious bird disease affecting many domestic and wild avian species. The disease is contagious through immediate contact between healthy birds and the bodily discharges of infected birds. This includes transmission through droppings, secretions from the nose, mouth and eyes. Newcastle disease spreads quickly among birds kept in captivity, such as commercially raised chickens. Symptoms include sneezing, gasping for air, nasal discharge, coughing, greenish and watery diarrhea, nervousness, depression, muscular tremors, drooping wings, twisting of head and neck, circling, complete paralysis, partial to complete drop in egg production and thin-shelled eggs, swelling of the tissues around the eyes and in the neck, and sudden death.\n\nNewcastle disease was first identified in Java, Indonesia, in 1926, and in 1927, in Newcastle upon Tyne, England (whence it got its name). However, it may have been prevalent as early as 1898, when a disease wiped out all the domestic fowl in northwest Scotland. Its effects are most notable in domestic poultry due to their high susceptibility and the potential for severe impacts of an epizootic on the poultry industries. It is endemic to many countries. The emergence and spread of new genotypes across the world represents a significant threat to poultry. This suggests that the disease is continuously evolving, leading to more diversity (Miller et al., 2009).\n\nUnfortunately, little has been done to comprehend the procedure and advancement of new genotypes (Alexander et al., 2012). Recent vNDV have been characterized as isolates and offer evidence which proposes an emergence of a fifth panzootic initiated by highly related vNDV isolates from Indonesia, Israel and Pakistan. These virus strains are related to older strains from wild birds. This suggests that unknown reservoirs harbor new vNDV isolates capable of additional panzootics.\n\nNo treatment for NDV exists, but the use of prophylactic vaccines and sanitary measures reduces the likelihood of outbreaks.\n\nChytridiomycosis caused by a chytrid fungus is a deadly fungal disease that has wiped out 30 amphibian species across the globe and has sent overall amphibian populations in decline. The fungus \"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis\" can be found on every continent with fertile soil and has contributed to the loss of some species of frogs and salamanders. In fact, it is estimated that 287 species of amphibians are infected with this disease in over 35 countries. These countries tend to have varied or tropical climates like those found in Central America, South America, and Africa with optimal climate conditions ranging from 17 degree Celsius to 23 degrees Celsius for the fungus to thrive.\n\nThe first reported instance of the chytrid fungus was in 1998 which was found on the skin of amphibians. Since amphibians absorb essential nutrients through their skin, the fungus attaches itself to the amphibian, suffocates the amphibian, and enters the blood stream of the organism. Some symptoms that are prevalent in affected species include lethargy and loss of equilibrium and begin to die 21 days after infection. Frogs that have died and are examined show high density of the fungal spores in keratinized areas of the body such as the pelvis, mouth, and underbelly.\n\nThe fungus is spread through the transportation of amphibious species by humans. Infected amphibians that have escaped or are released into the wild can carry the fungus and therefore invade the surrounding habitats of local species that are not immune to the disease. Species like the American Bullfrog and African Clawed Frog can carry this disease without experiencing symptoms or death; these kinds of species are usually to blame for the spread of the disease in undeveloped habitats.\n\nSome characteristics of amphibians that are more likely to be susceptible to the disease are the lack of various developed microbiota that live and breed on the dermis of the species as well the underdeveloped immune system in specific amphibians. Species that tend to breed in flowing water which washes away the microbiota from the skin of amphibians are more likely to become infected. Organizations across the world have tried to implement rules and regulations for the transportation of amphibians across borders to prevent the continued decline of amphibians however progress has been slow. To add to the slow progress, the only cure that exists for chytrid fungus is found within laboratories for amphibians in captivity. Because of this, there is no known way for eradicating the disease in the wild.\n\n"}

The book was initially published by David McKay Company in January 1975.\n\nHe makes three basic arguments. First, he examines the economic impact of slavery, in the United States, the West Indies, and elsewhere. He distinguishes rural slavery from urban slavery, and circumstances in which blacks so predominated that many economic tasks fell to them of necessity, from circumstances in which blacks were punished for initiative and the development of skills.\n\nNext, he compares the economic skills, circumstances, and successes of American blacks, other blacks, Puerto Ricans, Chicanos, Jews, Irish, Italians, Scots, and other ethnic groups. He notes statistical quirks; \"e.g.\", comparisons of per capita income need to be checked against the median age of the groups concerned. The median age of Russians in the U.S. at the time of the book's publishing (1975) was 47, of the Irish 36, of blacks 23, of Puerto Ricans, 18. Income tends to be higher in higher age cohorts; and unemployment tends to be higher in lower cohorts. If one matches age cohort to age cohort—those in their twenties, in their thirties, in their forties, etc., comparisons are considerably more just.\n\nHe also argues that the stark comparisons between \"whites\" and \"blacks\" are misleading.\n\nHis third argument criticizes past governmental and economic policies, and opens up questions for the future. He has criticisms to make of liberals, radicals, and conservatives, each of whom, he finds, protect their favorite illusions with respect to blacks.\n\n\"Race and Economics\" greatly influenced Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n"}

Having the bear cub \"Misha\" as the mascot of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games was evidently intended to counter the \"big and brutal Russian Bear\" image with a small, cuddly and smiling bear cub.\n\nIn Russia associations with the image of the bear have received relatively mixed reactions. On one hand, Russians themselves appreciate the bear for its raw power and cunning, and bears are very often used as mascots or as a part of a design on a logo. On the other hand, the overuse of the image of the bear by foreigners visiting Russia prior to 20th century led to the image of bear being a sort of insider joke, postulating that \"Russian streets are full of bears\" as an example of factually inaccurate information about Russia.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was some support in the Russian Parliament for having a bear as the new Russian coat of arms – with the proposers pointing out that \"Russia is anyway identified in the world with the Bear\" – though eventually it was the Tsarist-era coat of arms of the Double-headed eagle that was restored.\n\nLater, the bear was taken up as the symbol of the United Russia Party, which has dominated political life in Russia since the early 2000s. Coincidentally, the surname of Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian president elected in 2008, is the possessive adjective of \"медведь\": i.e. his surname means \"bear's\".\n\nIn his successful 1984 re-election campaign, Ronald Reagan used the bear motif in the famous \"Bear in the woods\" ad, which claimed that he recognized the existence of a Soviet threat, and that his opponent denied its existence.\n\nRussian amateur wrestler Aleksandr Karelin has also been nicknamed the \"Russian Bear\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2551242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2551242", "title": "Studio system", "text": "Studio system\n\nThe studio system (which was used during a period known as the Golden Age of Hollywood) is a method of film production and distribution dominated by a small number of \"major\" studios in Hollywood. Although the term is still used today as a reference to the systems and output of the major studios, historically the term refers to the practice of large motion picture studios between the 1920s and 1960s of (a) producing movies primarily on their own filmmaking lots with creative personnel under often long-term contract, and (b) dominating exhibition through vertical integration, i.e., the ownership or effective control of distributors and exhibition, guaranteeing additional sales of films through manipulative booking techniques such as block booking.\n\nThe studio system was challenged under the anti-trust laws in a 1948 Supreme Court ruling which sought to separate production from the distribution and exhibition and ended such practices, thereby hastening the end of the studio system. By 1954, with television competing for audience and the last of the operational links between a major production studio and theater chain broken, the historic era of the studio system was over.\n\nThe period stretching from the introduction of sound to the beginning of the demise of the studio system, 1927–1948, is referred to by some film historians as the Golden Age of Hollywood. The Golden Age is a purely technical distinction and not to be confused with the style in film criticism known as Classical Hollywood cinema, a style of American film which developed from 1917 to 1963 and characterizes it to this day.\nDuring the so-called Golden Age, eight companies constituted the major studios that promulgated the Hollywood studio system. Of these eight, five were fully integrated conglomerates, combining ownership of a production studio, distribution division, and substantial theater chain, and contracting with performers and filmmaking personnel: Fox Film Corporation (later 20th Century Fox), Loew’s Incorporated (owner of America's largest theater circuit and parent company to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer), Paramount Pictures, RKO Radio Pictures, and Warner Bros. Two majors—Universal Pictures and Columbia Pictures—were similarly organized, though they never owned more than small theater circuits. The eighth of the Golden Age majors, United Artists, owned a few theaters and had access to two production facilities owned by members of its controlling partnership group, but it functioned primarily as a backer-distributor, loaning money to independent producers and releasing their films.\n\nThe years 1927 and 1928 are generally seen as the beginning of Hollywood's Golden Age and the final major steps in establishing studio system control of the American film business. The success of 1927's \"The Jazz Singer\", the first feature-length \"talkie\" (in fact, the majority of its scenes did not have live-recorded sound) gave a big boost to the then midsized Warner Bros. studio. The following year saw both the general introduction of sound throughout the industry and two more smashes for Warners: \"The Singing Fool\", \"The Jazz Singer\"'s even more profitable follow-up, and Hollywood's first \"all-talking\" feature, \"Lights of New York\". Just as significant were a number of offscreen developments. Warner Bros., now flush with income, acquired the extensive Stanley theater chain in September 1928. One month later, it purchased a controlling interest in the First National production company, more prominent than Warners itself not long before. With the First National acquisition came not only a studio and backlot but another large string of movie theaters. Warners had hit the big time.\n\nThe last of the \"Big Five\" Hollywood conglomerates of the Golden Age emerged in 1928: RKO. The Radio Corporation of America (RCA), led by David Sarnoff, was looking for ways to exploit the cinema sound patents, newly trademarked RCA Photophone, owned by its parent company, General Electric. As the leading film production companies were all preparing to sign exclusive agreements with Western Electric for their technology, RCA got into the movie business itself. In January, General Electric acquired a sizable interest in Film Booking Offices of America (FBO), a distributor and small production company owned by Joseph P. Kennedy, father of future president John F. Kennedy. In October, through a set of stock transfers, RCA gained control of both FBO and the Keith-Albee-Orpheum theater chain; merging them into a single venture, it created the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corporation, Sarnoff chairing the board. With RKO and Warner Bros. (soon to become Warner Bros.–First National) joining Fox, Paramount, and Loew's/MGM as major players, the Big Five that would remain for thirty years were now in place.\n\nAlthough RKO was an exception, the heads of studios on the west coast, the 'movie moguls', had mostly been in place for some years: Louis B. Mayer at MGM, Jack L. Warner at Warner Bros., Adolph Zukor at Paramount, Darryl F. Zanuck (at 20th Century Fox from 1935), Carl Laemmle at Universal, and Harry Cohn at Columbia.\n\nThe ranking of the Big Five in terms of profitability (closely related to market share) was largely consistent during the Golden Age: MGM was number one eleven years running, 1931–41. Paramount, the most profitable studio of the early sound era (1928–30), faded for the better part of the subsequent decade, and Fox was number two for most of MGM's reign. Paramount began a steady climb in 1940, finally edging past MGM two years later; from then until its reorganization in 1949 it was again the most financially successful of the Big Five. With the exception of 1932—when all the companies but MGM lost money, and RKO lost somewhat less than its competitors—RKO was next to last or (usually) last every year of the Golden Age, with Warner generally hanging alongside at the back of the pack. Of the smaller majors, the Little Three, United Artists reliably held up the rear, with Columbia strongest in the 1930s and Universal ahead for most of the 1940s.\n\nHollywood's success grew during the Great Depression, possibly because films helped audiences escape their personal difficulties. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said of Shirley Temple, \"When the spirit of the people is lower than at any other time during this Depression, it is a splendid thing that for just fifteen cents an American can go to a movie and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles\". By 1939 there were 15,000 movie theaters in the United States, more than banks; the number of theaters per capita was twice that of the mid-1980s. The cinema industry was larger than that for office machines. While only the 14th largest by revenue, it was second in the percentage of profits that its executives received. Top stars such as Bing Crosby and Claudette Colbert were paid more than $400,000 a year ($ today).\n\nOne of the techniques used to support the studio system was block booking, a system of selling multiple films to a theater as a unit. Such a unit—five films was the standard practice for most of the 1940s—typically included only one particularly outstanding film, the rest a mix of A-budget pictures of lesser quality and B movies. As \"Life\" magazine wrote in 1957 in a retrospective on the studio system, \"It wasn't good entertainment and it wasn't art, and most of the movies produced had a uniform mediocrity, but they were also uniformly profitable ... The million-dollar mediocrity was the very backbone of Hollywood.\"\n\nOn May 4, 1948, in a federal antitrust suit known as the \"Paramount\" case brought against the entire Big Five, the U.S. Supreme Court specifically outlawed block booking. Holding that the conglomerates were indeed in violation of antitrust, the justices refrained from making a final decision as to how that fault should be remedied, but the case was sent back to the lower court from which it had come with language that suggested divorcement—the complete separation of exhibition interests from producer-distributor operations—was the answer. The Big Five, though, seemed united in their determination to fight on and drag out legal proceedings for years as they had already proven adept at—after all, the \"Paramount\" suit had originally been filed on July 20, 1938.\n\nHowever, behind the scenes at RKO, long the financially shakiest of the conglomerates, the court ruling came to be looked at as a development that could be used to the studio's advantage. The same month that the decision was handed down, multimillionaire Howard Hughes acquired a controlling interest in the company. As RKO controlled the fewest theaters of any of the Big Five, Hughes decided that starting a divorcement domino effect could actually help put his studio on a more equal footing with his competitors. Hughes signaled his willingness to the federal government to enter into a consent decree obliging the breakup of his movie business. Under the agreement, Hughes would split his studio into two entities, RKO Pictures Corporation and RKO Theatres Corporation, and commit to selling off his stake in one or the other by a certain date. Hughes's decision to concede to divorcement terminally undermined the argument by lawyers for the rest of the Big Five that such breakups were unfeasible.\n\nWhile many today point to the May court ruling, it is actually Hughes's agreement with the federal government - signed November 8, 1948 - that was truly the death knell for the Golden Age of Hollywood. Paramount soon capitulated, entering into a similar consent decree the following February. The studio, which had fought against divorcement for so long, became the first of the majors to break up, ahead of schedule, finalizing divestiture on December 31, 1949. By this time, there were 19,000 movie theaters in the United States.\n\nThrough Hughes's deal with the federal authorities, and those by the other studios that soon followed, the studio system lingered on for another half-decade. The major studio that adapted to the new circumstances with the most immediate success was the smallest, United Artists; under a new management team that took over in 1951, overhead was cut by terminating its lease arrangement with the Pickford-Fairbanks production facility and new relationships with independent producers, now often involving direct investment, were forged—a business model that Hollywood would increasingly emulate in coming years. The studio system around which the industry had been organized for three decades finally expired in 1954, when Loew's, the last holdout, severed all operational ties with MGM.\n\nHughes's gambit helped break the studio system, but it did little for RKO. His disruptive leadership—coupled with the draining away of audiences to television that was affecting the entire industry—took a toll on the studio that was evident to Hollywood observers. When Hughes sought to bail out of his RKO interest in 1952, he had to turn to a Chicago-based syndicate led by shady dealers without motion picture experience. The deal fell through, so Hughes was back in charge when the RKO theater chain was finally sold off as mandated in 1953. That year, General Tire and Rubber Company, which was expanding its small, decade-old broadcasting division, approached Hughes concerning the availability of RKO's film library for programming. Hughes acquired near-complete ownership of RKO Pictures in December 1954 and consummated a sale with General Tire for the entire studio the following summer.\n\nThe new owners quickly made some of their money back by selling the TV rights for the library they treasured to C&C Television Corp., a beverage company subsidiary. (RKO retained the rights for the few TV stations General Tire had brought along.) Under the deal, the films were stripped of their RKO identity before being sent by C&C to local stations; the famous opening logo, with its globe and radio tower, was removed, as were the studio's other trademarks.\n\nBack in Hollywood, RKO's new owners were encountering little success in the moviemaking business and by 1957 General Tire shut down production and sold the main RKO facilities to Desilu, the production company of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. Just like United Artists, the studio now no longer had a studio; unlike UA, it barely owned its old movies and saw no profit in the making of new ones. In 1959 it abandoned the movie business entirely.\n\nWhile the studio system is largely identified as an American phenomenon, film production companies in other countries did at times achieve and maintain full integration in a manner similar to Hollywood's Big Five. As historian James Chapman describes,\n\nIn Britain, only two companies ever achieved full vertical integration (the Rank Organization and the Associated British Picture Corporation). Other countries where some level of vertical integration occurred were Germany during the 1920s (Universum Film Aktiengesellschaft, or Ufa), France during the 1930s (Gaumont-Franco-Film-Aubert and Pathé-Natan) and Japan (Nikkatsu, Shochiku and Toho). In Hong Kong, Shaw Brothers adopted the studio system for its wuxia films throughout the 1950s-'60s. India, which represents perhaps the only serious rival to the U.S. film industry due to its dominance of both its own and the Asian diasporic markets, has, in contrast, never achieved any degree of vertical integration.\n\nFor instance, in 1929 nearly 75 percent of Japanese movie theaters were connected with either Nikkatsu or Shochiku, the two biggest studios at the time.\n\nIn the 1950s Hollywood faced three great challenges: The \"Paramount\" case ending the studio system, the new popularity of television, and post-World War II consumer spending providing its audience with many other leisure options. The scale of both box office successes and flops grew, with a \"dangerous middle\" consisting of films that in the previous era would have made money. A filmmaker stated in 1957 that \"[t]he one absolute disaster today is to make a million-dollar mediocrity. One of those you can lose not only your total investment but your total shirt.\" By that year Hollywood was only making about 300 feature films a year, compared to about 700 during the 1920s. Darryl F. Zanuck, head of 20th Century Fox, had no direct involvement with the studio from 1956 to 1962, and Louis B. Mayer, sacked in 1951 from MGM, died in 1957. Harry Cohn of Columbia, who died the following year, informed investors in the studio's annual report of 1957 that:\n\nFinancial backers increasingly demanded star actors, directors, and writers for projects to reduce risk of failure. The growing importance of the overseas market—40 to 50% of Hollywood's total revenue by 1957—also emphasized stars' names as box-office attractions. With their new power, \"working for nothing\"—receiving a percentage of profit instead of a salary—became a status symbol for stars. A top actor could expect 50% of profit, with a minimum guarantee, or 10% of gross revenue. Cary Grant, for example, received more than $700,000 from his 10% of the gross for \"To Catch a Thief\" (1955), while director and producer Alfred Hitchcock received less than $50,000. In one extreme case, Paramount promised Marlon Brando 75% of the profit of what became \"One-Eyed Jacks\" (1961). (Because of Hollywood accounting, studios still received much of the revenue before any profit sharing; thus, they preferred 50% of profit to 10% of gross.) The larger paychecks also increased the power of talent agents such as Lew Wasserman of MCA, whose office was now nicknamed \"Fort Knox\".\n\nBy 1957, independent producers made 50% of full-length American films. Beyond working for others, top actors such as Gregory Peck and Frank Sinatra created their own production companies and purchased scripts. Top independent directors George Stevens, Billy Wilder, and William Wyler also saw their paychecks increase, in part because their involvement attracted star actors. Studios increasingly provided funding and facilities to independent producers as opposed to making their own films, or just like United Artists, they focused on distribution. While television had damaged Hollywood, TV production companies such as Desilu and the film studios' own TV divisions helped save the industry by using otherwise-unused facilities.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1960s the major studios began to reissue older films for syndication and transformed into mainly producing telefilms and b-movies to supply TV's demand for programming. Between 1969 and 1971 the industry underwent a severe recession, due in part to big-budget flops, but soon recovered artistically with such films as \"The Godfather\" (1972) and \"Chinatown\" (1974).\n\nThe onset of George Lucas's \"Star Wars\" (1977) became the prototype for the modern blockbuster. The release of films at hundreds of venues became the norm with hits such as the sequels to Lucas's \"Star Wars\", \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\", Spielberg's back-to-back successes with \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\", and the development of home-video and cable television. Meanwhile, the uncontrolled budget of \"Heaven's Gate\" (1980), and its limited box-office revenue, led to the sale of United Artists.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1995, New Hollywood turned into more of a conglomerate Hollywood and quickly dominating the global entertainment industry.\nAs of 2007, five of the Golden Age majors continue to exist as major Hollywood studio entities, each as part of a larger media conglomerate: Columbia (owned by Sony), 20th Century Fox (owned by Disney), Warner Bros. (owned by AT&T), Paramount (owned by Viacom), and Universal (owned by Comcast). In addition, the Walt Disney Studios has emerged as a major, resulting in a \"Big Six\". With the exception of Disney, all of these so-called major studios are essentially based on the model not of the classic Big Five, but of the old United Artists: that is, they are primarily backer-distributors (and physical studio leasers) rather than actual production companies.\n\nSony, in addition to ownership of Columbia, also has effective control of the relatively small latter-day incarnation of MGM and its subsidiary UA; under the Sony umbrella, MGM/UA operates as a \"mini-major,\" nominally independent of but closely associated with Columbia. In 1996, Time Warner acquired the once-independent New Line Cinema via its purchase of Turner Broadcasting System. In 2008, New Line was merged into Warner Bros., where it continues to exist as a subsidiary. Each of today's Big Six controls quasi-independent \"arthouse\" divisions, such as Paramount Vantage. Miramax Films (which originally was an independent studio) was owned by Disney until 2010. Most also have divisions that focus on genre movies, B movies either literally by virtue of their low budgets, or spiritually—for instance, Sony's Screen Gems. One so-called indie division, Universal's Focus Features, releases arthouse films under that primary brand. Both Focus and Fox's arthouse division, Fox Searchlight, are large enough to qualify as mini-majors. Two large independent firms also qualify as mini-majors, Lionsgate and The Weinstein Company. They stand somewhere between latter-day versions of the old \"major-minor\" - just like Columbia and Universal was in the 1930s and 1940s, except Lionsgate and The W.C. have about half their market share—and leading Golden Age independent production outfits such as Samuel Goldwyn Inc. and the companies of David O. Selznick.\n\nIn the mid-2010s, major studios shifted towards producing mainstream films that appeal to the audience (genre films, sequels, 3-D, and superhero films). As these films risk losing money at the box-office (and some, in fact, have), an opportunity opened up for independent companies to produce films that in recent years have upset other major studio films for the Academy Award for Best Picture. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (which produces the annual Academy Awards) generally award Best Picture Oscars to films of substance and high quality rather than the popular mainstream film. Between 2014's \"Birdman\" and 2017's \"The Shape of Water\" (both produced by the same major studio, 20th Century Fox), the multiple award wins for independent films such as \"Spotlight\" (Open Road, 2015) and \"Moonlight\" (A24, 2016) had a major impact on box-office intake of other major studio films, and possibly the fate of major studios themselves, and even so today with the latest wave of independent films. This continuing dominance of the independent film is proof that its success is not dependent on any film format, whether it be 3-D, CinemaScope, or any large-format such as IMAX. The recent outcomes of the Cannes Film Festival and the lack of American films winning these awards may also have affected the dominance of independent film.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5191091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5191091", "title": "Terra Diver", "text": "Terra Diver\n\n, also known as Terra Diver, is a vertical-scrolling shooting game by Raizing originally released as an arcade game for the ST-V platform in 1996. The game was ported to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in 1997, with neither port being released outside of Japan.\n\n\"Soukyugurentai\" is a vertical-scrolling shooter. The player picks one of three different ships - red, green or blue - each with their own pilot, fire pattern and laser web. Each ship has a standard gun and a bomb, but the most distinctive of these aspects is the laser-web: holding down the button for the standard gun will release a lock-on laser-web traditionally shaped as a cone or semicircle, which will destroy the enemies it locks onto after releasing the buttons. Each ship has two different lock-on weapons that function as web-designed laser targets. Once an enemy enters the web's range, the player can destroy the enemy or multiple enemies can be destroyed via homing lasers or multiple fire-balls. The game is unusual in that, rather than using a 3:4 aspect ratio to better suit the vertically-oriented gameplay, it uses a horizontal monitor (4:3) in the style of Neo Geo vertical shooters as well as the later \"Radiant Silvergun\" and \"Giga Wing\".\n\nAfter exhausting the Earth’s resources, particularly fossil fuel, innumerable trade companies team up with NASA and begin initiating space programs dedicated to finding resources outside the planet Earth. Mining facilities are established in different areas outside of Earth, particularly on large asteroids near the Moon and most especially on Mars. Various resources are found from these areas and distributed to Earth which aid in the world economy. The largest company that is established from this is the Jin-Sei (Exhausting Star) Corporation set in Japan which is worth 1 trillion in New Yen investments, founded by the Miama family.\n\nHowever, after years of space resource distribution, the separate companies started initiating attacks that would dominate other company’s resources. The strongest of these attacks started on Martian colonies established by the second largest company on Earth, Eight Luck Interstellar Development Inc., which banded with smaller companies across Earth including ones in China, England, and America. Eight Luck planned on claiming Mars for its own so as to monopolize on the outsourcing of minerals as well as developing terraformed areas.\n\nIn response to these attacks, the Jin-Sei formed a union with the JDF (a future version of the JSDF) and began working on a space fighter program organized by Defensive Section 2 of the JDF known as the Soukyugurentai (SOQ for short), which utilized a unique laser technology fighting system known as NALS (Non-blind spot All range Laser System) in combat. The threat of eco-terrorism was on the rise as out-spoken ecosystem protectionism groups opposed the company's outsourcing of materials; these were used as subsequent cover-up stories to hide the company war waging between Jin-Sei and Eight Luck from public awareness. Made up of the best fighters adapted to this combat system as well as innumerable stamina strengthening tests for space travel, the SOQ are sent in to defend company territory from rival companies on Earth and space at all costs.\n\n\"Soukyugurentai\" was first distributed for the arcades in Japan in September 1996. The game was released as a cartridge kit for Sega's ST-V arcade system board. While the game was never widely distributed outside Japan, inserting the cartridge on a foreign ST-V board will set the in-game language to English and change the title to \"Terra Diver\" (both titles are printed on the cartridge's label).\n\nA Sega Saturn version was released by Electronic Arts on February 1997, five months after the arcade release. Because the original arcade hardware was directly based on the Sega Saturn architecture, this is a close conversion of the original game. Several options and features were also added, including a practice mode which allows the player to try out any of the game's stages without going through the entire campaign, as well as support for the Multi Controller and Mission Stick. A bargain-priced version was released on December 1997, titled , which includes a demo for the Saturn version of \"Battle Garegga\".\n\nA PlayStation version was also released by Data East on December 1997 titled . This version features a Special Mode which adds a fourth playable ship and a new final stage, as well as animated opening and ending videos and a voiced navigator. It supports the analog controls of the DualShock controller. The PlayStation was reissued on May 2003 by Hamster as part of their MajorWave budget label.\n\n\"Soukyugurentai\" was ported to Japanese feature phones in 2005 and was available for EZWeb, i-mode and Yahoo! Keitai devices.\n\n\"Sōkyū Gurentai\" was one of Raizing's most popular arcade games. \"Consoles +\" rated the Sega Saturn version at 92%.\n\n"}
{"id": "104619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=104619", "title": "The Super Dimension Fortress Macross", "text": "The Super Dimension Fortress Macross\n\n\"Macross\" () is a science fiction series that combines transformable mecha, apocalyptic battles, wartime romance, and music. It features mechanical designs by Kazutaka Miyatake and Shoji Kawamori (both of Studio Nue) and character designs by Haruhiko Mikimoto of Artland. \"Macross\" also created one of the first anime idols Lynn Minmay, turning her voice actress Mari Iijima into an instant celebrity, and launching her musical career. Most of its animation (with edited content and revised dialogue) was adapted in the USA for the first saga of \"Robotech\".\n\nIn 1999 a city-sized alien spacecraft crashes in South Ataria Island on Earth. Over the course of 10 years the military organization \"U.N. Spacy\" reverse-engineers its technology and rebuilds the spacecraft, naming it the SDF-1 Macross. In 2009 at the launch ceremony of the Macross, a young civilian pilot, Hikaru Ichijyo, comes to visit the \"Macross\" upon U.N. Spacy pilot Roy Focker's request. During the launch ceremony, a space war fleet from an alien race of humanoid giants arrives into the solar system and identifies the Macross as a former battleship used by their enemies, the Supervision Army. As the aliens, known as the Zentradi, approach the Macross, the original systems override the crew's commands and fire its main cannon, wiping out the advance alien scouts and starting a war. While Hikaru takes the new VF-1 Valkyrie on a test flight the aliens retaliate. He then encounters Lynn Minmay and rescues her from the aliens. The \"Macross\" crew attempts to use the experimental \"Fold System\" (Faster-than-light drives) to escape to the Moon's orbit, but instead it accidentally takes the \"Macross\" and South Ataria Island to the edge of the solar system. The people from the \"Macross\" salvage everything they can, including the city surrounding the ship and its civilians (who have survived in special safety shelters, which were transported along intact), and attach two aircraft carriers to the ship. Since the fold systems have vanished after the jump, the \"Macross\" is forced to make its way back to Earth by conventional power.\n\nThe Zentradi suspect the humans might be their creators, the Protoculture. Under the command of Britai Kridanik and Exsedol Folmo, they plot ways to understand them. Fearful of their old combat directives of not interfering with Protoculture, the Zentradi perform attacks to test their theories about the people on board the \"Macross\", and even have their Zentradi soldiers \"micloned\" (miniaturized) to learn more about their culture. The Zentradi capture several Macross personnel including Officer Misa Hayase and Hikaru to study. Boddole Zer, Supreme Commander of the Zentradi, is puzzled over things such as relationships amongst males and females. He confirms that the Miclones \"are\" protoculture during a demonstrated kiss between Hayase and Hikaru. After escaping, Hikaru and the others report their findings to their superiors, who have trouble accepting the reasons behind the Zentradi attacks as well as the huge forces the aliens possess.\n\nAfter much difficulty returning to Earth, the UN Spacy refuses to allow the \"Macross\" and the civilian passengers to return to land. Minmay's cousin, Lynn Kaifun, decides to join the \"Macross\" to see his parents and also look after Minmay. Because of Kaifun's relationship and constant contact with Minmay, the pair eventually enter a romantic relationship. After deliberation, the UN Spacy orders the Macross to leave Earth as a means to get the Zentradi away from them. During all these events, a female Zentradi ace fighter pilot, Milia Fallyna, is micloned and attempts to assassinate Maximilian Jenius, an ace UN Spacy pilot. Attempting to kill him during a knife duel, Milia is defeated and falls in love with Max, and the two are subsequently married. Their wedding aboard the \"Macross\" is broadcast to the Zentradi as a message that aliens and humans can co-exist. Since the Zentradi's exposure to culture and to Lynn Minmay's songs, some of them become eager to join the humans. Believing the \"miclone contamination\" is becoming a threat to all Zentradi forces, Boddole Zer orders his entire army to exterminate the human race and all those Zentradi previously exposed to human culture. Because Britai Kridanik was \"contaminated\" as well, he works with the humans to defeat the main Zentradi forces.\n\nThe resulting battle culminates in the large scale devastation of Earth, but the people of the SDF-1 survive. After Boddole Zer is killed and his armada defeated, the surviving humans and their Zentradi allies begin rebuilding Earth.\n\nTwo years after the end of the first Space War the transition into the Human ways becomes difficult to some Zentradi who can't stand the idea of a pacified life. Quamzin Kravshera constantly incites conflicts towards the civilians. He repairs a damaged Zentradi warship to return to his old ways and attacks the new Macross City built around the SDF-1. Moments before the final Zentradi attack, Misa Hayase tells Hikaru Ichijyo of her feelings for him and her decision to leave to space in a colonization mission to preserve human culture across the galaxy. Lynn Minmay, who was left by Kaifun and now loves Hikaru, doesn't want him to leave to join the fight. However, Hikaru still goes to defend the city anyway. Eventually Quamzin is killed. After a long emotional conflict Hikaru finally decides to be with Misa and join the colonization mission, but the two remain good friends with Minmay in the end.\n\n\nA number of sequels and one prequel to the series have been produced.\n\n\"For more information, see: Macross – Series Chronology\"\n\nThe series title uses the name of the main spacecraft (which is usually shortened to \"SDF-1 Macross\" as it is Earth's first \"Super Dimension Fortress\"). The original name for the \"Macross\" project was \"Battle City Megaload\" (or \"Battle City Megaroad\", as the Japanese transliteration to either or gives the title a double meaning in reference to the story line: \"Megaload\", referring to the spacecraft containing an entire city of people; and \"Megaroad\", referring to the long journey through space back to Earth). However, the director of Big West, one of the later sponsors of the project, was a fan of Shakespeare and wanted the series and the spacecraft to be named \"Macbeth\" (). A compromise was made with the title \"Macross\" () due to its similar pronunciation to \"Macbeth\" in Japanese and because it still contained connotations to the original title. The word \"Macross\" also comes from a wordplay combination of the prefix \"macro\" in reference to its massive size (though when compared with the alien ships in the series, it is only a relatively small capital ship) and the distance they must cross.\n\n\"Super Dimension Fortress\" prefix (\"Chō Jikū Yōsai\") is a wordplay on an intermediary working title for the series, which was originally \"Super Dreadnought Fortress Macross\" (\"Chō Dokyū Yōsai Makurosu\").\n\nOriginally proposed in 1980 and greatly inspired by Mobile Suit Gundam (1979-1980), the show created by Studio Nue (from an original concept by newcomer member Shoji Kawamori) was initially sponsored by a group called the \"Wiz\" (\"Uizu\") Corporation that was prepared to fund a 48-episode run. \"Wiz\" wanted to produce the Sci-Fi show as an outer space comedy, but this clashed with Studio Nue's original idea of a more serious and epic \"space opera\" storyline. The resulting animosity between both companies made the initial pre-production of the series very difficult and full of delays.\n\nHowever, by 1981 Wiz had gone out of business and the \"Megaload/Megaroad\" (\"Macross\") project seemed to be in permanent hiatus. Studio Nue bought the rights of the show from \"Wiz\" and searched for a sponsor with no avail. Big West, an advertising agency looking to branch out into animation sponsorship, approached Studio Nue about the project and agreed to sponsor it. Big West insisted on a leaner budget, not convinced that the show would pan out as profitable and pared the episode count to 27 episodes (meaning the show would have ended with the battle against Boddole Zer's fleet). Even then, Big West found that the show was going to run more expensive than it had bargained for, and to secure more money, entered into a partnership with animation studio Tatsunoko Production which included international distribution (what would culminate in the creation of the \"Robotech\" adaptation a few years later).\n\nAmong other production headaches, the master copy of one nearly-completed episode was reportedly accidentally left on a train by a courier, forcing the members of the production staff themselves to search for the footage – otherwise they would have to re-animate it all, at a considerable cost in time and money. Eventually they found the reel, and so disaster was averted.\n\nWhen Macross debuted on 3 October 1982 (with only three episodes made so far) its stunning success among Japanese television audiences convinced Big West to approve an extension to 36 episodes, allowing the staff to end with the \"two years after\" story arc.\n\nStudio Nue was unable to carry all of the animation work itself at the time (although the success of Macross meant that it was able to do so with nearly all of its other animation projects), and so work was contracted out to a number of satellite studios, including Artland (Haruhiko Mikimoto's employer), the nascent AIC and Gainax studios, as well as the Tatsunoko-supplied AnimeFriend and Star Pro. AnimeFriend and Star Pro are infamously notorious among fans of the show for having brought in very spotty, off-model and continuity error-laden animation work.\n\nThere were plans for a splashy ending to the series, one that would have shown major characters Misa Hayase and Hikaru Ichijo blasting off in the colonization ship \"SDF-2 Megaroad-01\", but the sequence was scrapped due to lack of time and budget. However, due to fan demand this sequence was later used in the \"Macross Flashback 2012\" OVA released in 1987.\n\n\"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross\" was produced as the first of the three \"Super Dimension\" mecha anime television series in Japan. It was followed by \"The Super Dimension Century Orguss\" (1983) and \"The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross\" (1984). These shows were related in name only.\n\nIn 1984, Harmony Gold licensed the first \"Macross\" series from Tatsunoko and planned to dub the series on home video. In 1985, Harmony Gold edited and rewrote the series with \"The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross\" and \"Genesis Climber Mospeada\" into \"Robotech\", to syndicate on weekday television and to promote a Revell model line. \"Robotech\"'s credits listed only the English adaptation's production crew and two Tatsunoko producers. In 1999, Harmony Gold asserted it had exclusive rights to the \"distribution of the Macross television series and the right to create and authorize the sale of merchandise based on such series\" outside Japan, and began sending cease-and-desist letters to import toy dealers, temporarily barring \"Macross\"-related merchandise from North America.\n\nThe merchandise has since been imported again by the same toy dealers in direct sales, and Harmony Gold has sublicensed additional material for North American retail distribution.\n\nIn 2000, Big West and Studio Nue took Tatsunoko Productions to the Tokyo District Court over who had the rights to the first \"Macross\" series, due to Harmony Gold's attempt to bar Japanese Macross merchandise in North America the previous year. During production, Big West entered into a partnership with Tatsunoko to assist in the production of the series in a deal where it acquired the license to distribute the show worldwide (i.e., outside Japan), as well as earning some royalties to the merchandise. Tatsunoko then sub-licensed \"Macross\" to Harmony Gold USA in 1984. In 2002, the Tokyo District Court ruled that Big West/Studio Nue is the sole owner of the original character and mecha designs for the first series,\nwhile that same court ruled in 2003 that Tatsunoko owned the production rights to the first series.\n\nIn the autumn of 1984, Harmony Gold released the first English-language version of \"Macross\": an English-dubbed VHS video release containing unedited video footage of the first three episodes with a new English theme song, adapted dialogue scripts, and several name changes (which were later used in \"Robotech\", aside from Rick Yamada/Hikaru Ichijyo, who became Rick Hunter). This release was canceled after one volume when production of the \"Robotech\" adaptation began. The first episode of this 1984 English dubbing was later released as an extra in the \"Robotech Legacy Collection 5\" and \"Robotech Protoculture Collection\" DVD releases, and is also included in the first volume of ADV Films' 2006 release of \"Macross\".\n\nStreamline Pictures then released \"Robotech Perfect Collection: Macross\" on VHS in the summer of 1994, combining two English subtitled episodes of \"Macross\" and the corresponding dubbed episodes of the \"Robotech\" adaptation in each volume. This was the first English subtitling for \"Macross\", but it contained unedited video footage with incomplete and mistranslated English subtitles and was cancelled after eight volumes and 16 episodes.\n\nThe series was originally licensed in North America by AnimEigo, who restored the series and released it unedited on DVD with Japanese audio and English subtitles. At first a limited edition pre-order boxset across nine discs was released on 21 December 2001. Preorders were available on AnimEigo's web store. Three smaller boxsets, each comprising three discs, were released from 10 September 2002. Finally, AnimEigo released nine individual volumes. In 2003 Madman Entertainment released a six-disc PAL format version of this edition entitled \"Macross Ultimate Collection\".\n\nIn the summer of 2005, ADV Films announced that it would be releasing an English dub of \"Macross\" on 10 January 2006. This is the first uncut, unedited English dub for \"Super Dimension Fortress Macross\", and featured Mari Iijima returning to reprise the role of Lynn Minmay. However, the voice actors used in the dub were not the same as those used in the 1985 Robotech adaptation. This version was released by Hulu for online streaming in the United States in February 2010 and was removed in February 2013.\n\nOn 25 July 2014, Lionsgate Home Entertainment announced that they would release a new \"Robotech\" DVD collection entitled \"Robotech: The Classic Collection\" exclusively through Amazon.com. Volume 1 contains the first 18 episodes of \"Robotech: The Macross Saga\" as it was originally broadcast, and the first 18 episodes of \"Macross\", completely uncut and presented in both Japanese with English subtitles and the ADV English dub.\n\nA new manga adaptation of the first TV series called was released in Japan during 2009. It is a comic format alternate telling of the events in \"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross\" (with modern character and mecha designs) that was being serialized in the \"Macross Ace\" manga magazine until its cancellation, being moved to \"Newtype Ace\" manga magazine, where it's being currently serialized. The artist for the new manga series is Haruhiko Mikimoto, who was the character designer for the original \"Macross\".\n\nA game based on the TV series called \"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross\" was released for the Japanese Nintendo Family Computer console in 1985 by video game company Namco.\n\nYears later Bandai released \"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross\" 3D shooting game in October 2003 in Japan for the Sony PlayStation 2 console. This game had levels based in both the TV series and its .\n\nMore recently, a new 3D shooting game called \"Macross Ace Frontier\" included several elements from the original series. It was developed by Artdink for the Sony PSP and was released in 2008.\n\nIn the \"Anime Encyclopedia\", authors Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy called the series \"One of the three unassailable pillars of anime sci-fi, pioneering the tripartite winning formula of songs, battling robot-planes and tense relationships\".\n\nFor the video game \"Devil May Cry 4\" motion and voice actor Reuben Langdon was told to make cockier than his younger persona albeit more mature. Despite the staff's concerns for the difficulties of such portrayal, Langdon had no issues after choosing Roy Focker from \"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross\" as his character model and noting he had almost the same age as Dante during production of the game.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "36042660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36042660", "title": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist", "text": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist\n\nTom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist is an action-adventure stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Toronto and published by Ubisoft. The sixth installment of the \"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell\" series, it is the sequel of \"\". The game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Xbox 360 in August 2013. In the game, players control Sam Fisher, a spymaster working for the Fourth Echelon, in a mission to stop the Engineers, a group of terrorists which is trying to coerce the United States into recalling all of its troops stationed abroad. \"Blacklist\" gameplay is similar to its predecessors, with players tasked with completing objectives and defeating enemies. \"Blacklist\" marks the return of the asymmetrical multiplayer mode Spies vs. Mercs, which was introduced in \"\".\n\nIt is the first title developed by Ubisoft Toronto, a studio founded by Ubisoft in 2009. The game was directed by Maxime Béland, who had worked on \"Conviction\", and produced by Jade Raymond. The game endeavors to combine elements of its predecessors, including the action focus of \"Conviction\" and the stealth focus of the older games. To prepare for this game, Béland studied reviews and feature lists of the latter. \"Blacklist\" is the first \"Splinter Cell\" game starring Eric Johnson as Sam Fisher, since series veteran Michael Ironside was unable to perform motion capture for the game. The Toronto studio focused on the game's Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, and its later-announced Wii U version was developed by Ubisoft Shanghai, which also developed the game's multiplayer.\n\n\"Blacklist\" pre-release reception was generally positive, despite criticism of its new voice actor. The game received generally positive reviews when it was released, with praise for its level design, story, gameplay, combat, soundtrack and multiplayer mode. However, criticism was directed at its dated graphics, lack of challenge and ending. It failed to meet Ubisoft's sales expectations, with sales of two million copies three months after its release.\n\nIn \"Blacklist\", players assume control of series protagonist Sam Fisher as he seeks to stop a terrorist group called the Engineers. The gameplay emphasizes stealth, and utilizes the third-person perspective. During the game, players can rotate its camera, run, crouch and leap over obstacles. Since \"Blacklist\" intended to continue the \"aggressive stealth\" of \"Conviction\" while retaining the traditional stealth features of the older games, it combines action and stealth, and allows players to use different approaches and methods to complete objectives and defeat enemies. Players can complete levels without being noticed by the non-playable characters' artificial intelligence by taking cover or using other traditional stealth methods. If the player chooses to kill enemies, other enemies are alerted when they see their companions' dead bodies. To avoid this, players can hide corpses. Fisher can also create a strategically advantageous dark environment by destroying nearby lights, and is equipped with customizable night-vision and sonar goggles to detect enemies in darkness and see through walls. He also has the Tri-Rotor, a compact surveillance drone which can spy on enemies, create distractions, give electric shocks, and self-destruct to kill enemies.\n\nPlayers can play a more aggressive run-and-gun game by using gadgets and weapons to eliminate enemies. They can interact with environmental objects, such as ledges and zip-lines, to navigate levels. \"Conviction\" mark-and-execute system returns in \"Blacklist\", with refinements and additions to allow players to mark several targets. When they attack, they can kill all marked targets instantly. Improvements made the system work more fluidly. A variety of enemies (including soldiers and dogs) are encountered in the game, following the protagonist and alerting their companions. Players have the option to kill them, leave them untouched, or incapacitate them, and the game classifies their choices in one of three categories: Ghost (stealthy play), Panther (stealthy, aggressive play), and Assault (aggressive play).\n\nWhen players kill (or avoid) targets and complete objectives, experience points and money are awarded to buy (or improve) weapons, and upgrade the \"Paladin\" airship and Sam's suit and equipment; the upgrades improve efficiency in completing missions. Experience gained depends on the difficulty level and how the game is played; the greater the stealth, the greater the reward. According to Ubisoft Toronto, the system, known as \"universal economy\", was intended to satisfy players; every action has a corresponding reward.\n\nThe \"Paladin\" is the game's hub. Between missions, players can interact with crew members on the ship and view the game's objectives. Crew members also offer the protagonist side missions to complete. Before a mission Fisher can deploy the strategic mission interface, allowing players to see enemy positions and plan attacks and routes. Players can also use the interface to access multiplayer modes and missions.\n\nAlthough the game has interrogation sequences involving questioning (or torturing) targets, it does not feature \"Conviction\" interactive torture scenes. Players can still decide whether to spare their targets or kill them after interrogation, and these decisions influence the relationship between Fisher and other crew members.\n\n\"Blacklist\" has platform-specific features, including voice integration with Xbox 360's Kinect peripheral which allows players to distract enemies before attacking them. A player can also use the Kinect sensor to control the protagonist with their body instead of the Xbox 360 controller. In the Wii U version, the Gamepad controller's touchscreen is an interface, accessing gadgets and other features from the protagonist's arm-mounted computer (OPSAT), and incorporating screen and motion controls to highlight enemies with thermal vision when using Killing in Motion. The Wii U version was not shipped with the game's cooperative mode.\n\nThe \"Spies vs. Mercs\" competitive mode introduced in \"\" again appears in \"Blacklist\". An asymmetrical multiplayer mode, it pits two teams (with different gadgets, playing as spies or mercenaries) against each other. Spies, in third-person perspective, are equipped with smoke grenades and flashbangs and are tasked with hacking computer stations heavily guarded by mercenaries. Mercenaries, in first person, can access lethal and longer-range weapons despite being unable to stealth-kill enemies. The mode has two varieties: Classic, supporting teams of 2v2, and Blacklist, supporting 4v4 action.\n\n\"Blacklist\" also has a co-operative multiplayer mode, where each mission can be accessed by talking with the crew of the \"Paladin\". Crew members offer a variety of missions and requirements for completing them, and players play as Fisher or his colleague Briggs; both have the same abilities. The game has a total of 14 missions, with split-screen play supported. In addition to co-op and Spies vs. Mercs, \"Blacklist\" has other multiplayer modes including Uplink control, Team Deathmatch, and Extraction.\n\n\"Blacklist\" again features Sam Fisher (Eric Johnson), a former Third Echelon Splinter Cell who is now the spymaster and commander of the newly installed Fourth Echelon. The game also sees the return of Fisher's old ally, Anna \"Grim\" Grímsdóttir (Kate Drummond), and new characters such as Isaac Briggs (Dwain Murphy) and Charlie Cole (David Reale). Several supporting characters from \"Conviction\" reappear, including Victor Coste (Howard Siegel), Patricia Caldwell (Mimi Kuzyk), and Andriy Kobin (Elias Toufexis), as well as interactive telephone conversations with Sarah Fisher (Victoria Sanchez).\n\nFollowing \"\", Third Echelon is dissolved and Sam Fisher works as a contractor for the private military corporation Paladin 9 Security, ran by his best friend Victor Coste. Terrorists assault the Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, executing its commander and killing many American soldiers. Sam and Coste were caught in the crossfire and Coste is heavily injured. Soon afterwards, a faction known as the Engineers takes responsibility, announcing a series of attacks on the United States, the titular Blacklist, which will continue until the U.S. recalls its troops deployed abroad.\n\nU.S. President Caldwell assigns Sam and his colleagues, tech expert Charlie Cole, CIA operative Isaac Briggs, and technical analyst Anna Grímsdóttir to Fourth Echelon, a new top secret special-ops and counter-terrorism unit. Charged with stopping the Engineers, the group uses the cargo plane \"Paladin\" as its command center. Fourth Echelon first aims to secure Andriy Kobin, an arms dealer (and Sam's past target) believed to possess information on the Engineers. Sam captures him at a militia headquarters in Benghazi, and learns that he sold arms to the Engineers before the Guam attack. Tracking down Kobin's buyers, Sam infiltrates an Engineer camp at Iraq. He finds an executed U.S. soldier and learns from a video recording that the executioner and the leader of the Engineers is Majid Sadiq (Carlo Rota); a former MI6 agent. The Engineers launch a strike on the site with a hacked military drone, and Sam narrowly escapes.\n\nBelieving that the next Blacklist attack is at Chicago, Sam infiltrates the site of the attack and prevents the release of a biological toxin into the water supply. Grim identifies Fourth Echelon's next target, Iran-affiliated mercenary broker Reza Nouri (Sam Kalilieh) who may have supplied the Engineers. Sam infiltrates Nouri's mansion in Paraguay, and extracts him as Iranian Qods Force commandos launch a simultaneous assault to kill Nouri. Nouri gives up intel on the Engineers in exchange for safety, leading to the discovery of an Engineer sleeper cell in London. Sam infiltrates an abandoned mill where the cell is operating and finds files suggesting that Iran is behind the Engineers, as well as chemical weapons and that Sadiq is on site. Sam is exposed to the chemical weapon when planting a tracker on a bomb, but continues to pursue Sadiq, leading to his incapacitation and capture by Sadiq. Briggs rescues Sam, but Sadiq escapes.\n\nDue to the files recovered by Sam being made public by the President, the United States and Iran are headed towards war. Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Sam infiltrates Qods Force headquarters in Tehran and steals files from their servers. The files prove that Iran did not back the Engineers, and that the files he recovered at London were planted by the Engineers in order to lure the United States into a war. The President announces the new information and deescalates the US-Iranian tension.\n\nThe chemical weapon tracker leads to the Philadelphia city train yard, in time for the next Blacklist attack. Sam and Briggs deploy to the site and disarms all bombs. With multiple Blacklist attacks foiled, the Engineers increase the rate of the Blacklist attacks from once per week to once per day.\n\nDuring this time, Nouri had given himself up to the CIA at the Guantanamo Bay detention camps, and is providing false intel convincing the CIA of Iran's culpability, trying to reignite tensions. Briggs uses his CIA credentials to help Sam infiltrate Guantanamo Bay, allowing him to interrogate Nouri. Nouri says he is planted by Sadiq to distract the US government while Sadiq hijacks a fuel tanker, and that Sadiq is fully aware of Fourth Echelon. Sam and Briggs escape from Guantanamo Bay and reach the \"Paladin\" at Yucatán. There, they fend off an attack from a drug cartel, tipped off by a bounty on Fourth Echelon from Sadiq.\n\nAs Fourth Echelon heads to defend the next Blacklist attack, Sadiq disables \"Paladin\" with a computer virus, intending to crash it. With Kobin's help, \"Paladin\" is restarted, but Sadiq successfully executes his attack during this time; he rams the fuel tanker into the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, and uses the same virus to disable all fuel facilities in the Gulf Coast, aiming to burn up all fuel in the area. Sam enters the burning facility and reactivates the fire control systems, stopping the fire's spread. Sam captures an Engineer leader and learns about Sadiq's final target: the government bunker \"Site F\" under the Denver International Airport.\n\nThe successful attack prompted the president to begin continuity-of-government procedures, transferring key government personnel into secure bunkers. Sadiq had sleeper agents in Site F and took officials in Site F hostage, including the Secretary of Defense. As COG procedures activate, all government files are backed up at Site F, which are Sadiq's true goal. Disregarding the president's order, Fourth Echelon infiltrates Site F. Sadiq tortures the secretary of defense to authorize the file transfer, while Briggs turns himself in to Sadiq. When the secretary yields, Briggs intervenes and kills the secretary, halting Sadiq's plan.\n\nSadiq tries to flee Site F by stealing the \"Paladin\", using Briggs and the hostages as human shields. Sam, disguised as a hostage, helps Delta Force snipers to take down Sadiq's men. Sadiq tries to escape on foot, and Sam incapacitates him after a fight. Sadiq boasts that he has already won; if he dies, twelve nations supporting the Engineers will declare war on the U.S., and if he is tried, he will leak U.S. secrets. Although Sam spares Sadiq, he detains him. President Caldwell publicly covers Sadiq's imprisonment by announcing his death, and the game ends as Fourth Echelon continues its operations; in a post-credits scene, a recovered Coste and Sam prepare to interrogate Sadiq.\n\nIntertwined with the main plot, the co-op missions begin with Fisher and Briggs infiltrating Kashmir. Finding a group of smugglers linked to the Engineers, Fisher and Briggs discover intelligence connecting them to the Russian intelligence organization Voron, before they escape during a drone attack.\n\nFollowing a lead to a friendly missile base in Bangalore, they find the Indian inhabitants dead and Voron agents stealing the warhead from a missile. Securing the missile and learning that the agents are led by a man named Cherski, Fisher and Briggs escape as the building is destroyed and Indian authorities arrive. Unaware of Cherski's identity, Fisher and Briggs track him to a Voron base in Chittagong and find him living in a nearby apartment. They breach Cherski's panic room and find two people; uncertain which one is Cherski, they begin interrogating both and learn about a secret base in Russia.\n\nFisher and Briggs reach an abandoned naukograd, surviving a drone attack, and find a secure medical facility said to contain an OpSat (satellite uplink device used by Fourth Echelon operatives) with vital Voron information. Instead, the base contains a comatose man. Rescuing the man, Fisher and Briggs narrowly escape as the base self-destructs and return the patient to the \"Paladin\". Grim identifies him as Mikhail \"Kestrel\" Loskov and Kobin confirms his identity, noting that they have a history (detailed in \"Conviction\"). When he questions Kobin (who asks if Kestrel's gunshot wound has put him into a coma), Fisher notes that no one had told Kobin how Kestrel had been incapacitated.\n\nUbisoft Montreal's success inspired the company to continue its Canadian expansion, and a new studio, Ubisoft Toronto, was announced on July 6, 2009. Headed by Jade Raymond, the studio focuses on the creation of triple-A video games and intellectual property. It worked on a new installment of the \"Splinter Cell\" series, which was in parallel development with an unnamed project, and the Toronto team was made up of Ubisoft Montreal's core \"Conviction\" team. Maxime Béland, who had worked on \"Conviction\", was the game's creative director, and in November 2010 Raymond confirmed that her studio was developing \"Splinter Cell 6\". Ubisoft Toronto was the game's lead developer, with assistance from Ubisoft Montreal. Ubisoft Shanghai developed the game's co-operative multiplayer mode. The Toronto studio focused on the game's Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, with the Wii U version developed by Ubisoft Shanghai.\n\nIn 2010, the series' fifth installment, \"\", was released. Although it received generally positive reviews, it was criticized by series fans for lacking some features. Béland considered \"Conviction\" a \"stepping stone\" for him when he prepared for the development of \"Blacklist\". The development team studied \"Conviction\" reviews and feature lists, deciding to discard its \"black-and-white\" stealth approach, and also deciding to bring back the Spies vs. Mercs mode introduced in \"Pandora Tomorrow\". Béland called the mode's return \"the easiest decision of [his] life\", since the team considered its absence \"Conviction\" greatest misstep. Ubisoft sent questionnaires through Uplay to thousands of players to collect feedback on \"Conviction\" new features. When players called \"Conviction\" campaign weak and short, the team added a stronger storyline and greater character depth by introducing the Fourth Echelon and Fisher as a leader (a series first). To encourage repeat play the team introduced the aircraft hub and the strategic mission interface, a player menu.\nAccording to Ubisoft Toronto founder Jade Raymond, the series had become too grueling and complicated for modern gamers, and its popularity had suffered relative to Ubisoft flagship franchises such as \"Assassin's Creed\" and \"Far Cry\". The Toronto studio hoped to introduce the franchise to a broader audience, while remaining tactical and hardcore for long-term series fans. It introduced a perfectionist mode, significantly increasing the game's difficulty by removing some of Fisher's abilities. The team also introduced accessible, action-oriented gameplay segments which would suit new players, crafting open-ended levels which could be reached with different approaches to broaden the variety of play. The developers re-worked the controls to increase gameplay fluidity, allowing players to automatically leap over objects and traverse a simplified environment.\n\nDuring \"Blacklist\" development, its team faced a variety of challenges. The first was to create stealth which was satisfying and fun for players. According to the team, players gain satisfaction from stealth with freedom and choices which allow them to develop a plan. Players must experiment, with each decision having consequences. Game director Patrick Redding compared it to the development of an ecosystem; the team designed a dynamic artificial intelligence which would react differently to players' actions, making levels feel alive and adding randomness. Encouraging the \"panther\" style of play (aggressive stealth), the team incorporated elements from the original \"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell\" (where one mistake would abort a mission) and \"Conviction\" (where stealth seamlessly becomes combat). This approach, the team thought, could help players to feel like elite, silent predators.\n\nSeries veteran Michael Ironside did not reprise his role as the voice of Sam Fisher. His part was played by Eric Johnson, who also performed the motion capture. In a \"Blacklist\" developer diary, Ironside said that he was passing the torch to another actor. According to Ubisoft executives the change was made to take advantage of new performance-capture technology to enrich the game experience, and Ironside assisted Johnson with the role. Elias Toufexis, voice and performance-capture actor for Andriy Kobin in \"\", said that he would return for the new game.\n\nUnlike \"Conviction\", the game would have no interactive torture sequences. Instead, players could choose whether to kill or incapacitate a target after interrogation. The system was not complex, and it was hoped that players would choose based on instinct. According to Béland, every player choice is gray and there are no right or wrong choices. However, the game demo has an interactive torture scene in which players can decide how deeply a knife penetrates a person's shoulder. After a mixed-to-negative response, Ubisoft removed the scene from its final product.\n\n\"Splinter Cell: Blacklist\" was introduced at E3 2012's Microsoft press conference on June 4, 2012, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. In February 2013, a Wii U version was rumored to be in development, and Ubisoft confirmed the report two months later. Originally scheduled for release in early 2013, the game was pushed back to August on January 16, 2013. On August 3, 2013, Ubisoft confirmed that the game had been declared gold, indicating that it was being prepared for duplication and release. \"Splinter Cell: Blacklist\" was released in North America on August 20 and in Europe three days later for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Xbox 360.\n\nThe Paladin Collector's Edition, a limited edition of the game, has a remote-controlled plane, the graphic novel \"Splinter Cell Echoes\", a Billionaire's Yacht co-op map, an Upper Echelon pack with a Dead Coast map, gold sonar goggles, and a limited-edition poster. \"Splinter Cell: Blacklist - Spider Bot\", a 2D puzzle game tie-in, was released for Android and iOS platforms on June 10, 2013 and is available on Google Play and the App Store respectively. \"Homeland\", downloadable content for the game, was released on September 26, 2013. It added a crossbow, several new costumes, and two new missions which can be completed alone or with another player.\n\nAlthough Joystiq's Mike Schramm praised \"Blacklist\" early screenshots and videos for removing \"Conviction\" monochromatic visuals, its new voice actor was not received well by some fans. Ubisoft responded with a statement that Ironside was not returning as Fisher because an actor \"physically capable\" of a motion-capture performance was needed, and Johnson was hired for the role.\n\n\"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist\" received positive reviews. The review aggregator website Metacritic rated the PlayStation 3 version 84 out of 100, the Xbox 360 version 82 out of 100, the PC version 82 out of 100, and the Wii U version 75 out of 100.\n\nThe game's design was praised by most reviewers. Ryan McCaffrey of IGN praised the gameplay's variety and player options, which he thought made \"Blacklist\" the best installment in the series since \"\". According to McCaffrey, the game was a satisfying stealth experience and an excellent, capable shooter (increasing its replay value). He noted that several segments forced players to use the Mark and Execute feature, frustrating players who favored stealth over action. Ben Reeves of \"Game Informer\" praised the return and refinement of Mark and Execute, which he found satisfying, and praised the game's intense, varied mission design. Tom Bramwell of \"Eurogamer\" disliked the game's direction, particularly its action elements (which he compared to 2012's \"\").\n\n\"Blacklist\" campaign was also generally praised. According to IGN's McCaffrey, the game's story is superior to those of its predecessors: well-balanced and believable. He criticized Sam Fisher's new voice actor, who he thought failed to replicate Ironside's charm. Ben Reeves praised the story's plot twists and sympathetic characters. On the Joystiq blog, Xav De Matos liked the game's narrative urgency and engaging plot twists but criticized its rushed ending. Simon Miller of VideoGamer.com called the game forgettable and boring, with Fisher's new voice actor failing to bring personality to the character. \"Eurogamer\" Bramwell also criticized the game's lack of character development.\n\nIts multiplayer features were praised; according to McCaffrey, the co-operative multiplayer mode had enough content for a separate game. Although he appreciated Spies vs. Mercs' faster pace, he found the mode less innovative than its predecessor. Reeves partially agreed, describing the revived Spies vs. Mercs mode as refreshing, intense, and bloody. De Matos wrote that it was one of the best multiplayer modes he had ever experienced, and the \"Blacklist\" version had evolved and modernized while remaining creative. Daniel Bloodworth of GameTrailers praised the game's satisfying co-op design, which tasks players to plan and coordinate strategy.\n\n\"Blacklist\" graphics and lack of difficulty were criticized (the former likely due to the game still using Unreal Engine 2.5 that Splinter Cell games since \"Chaos Theory\" have used). McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly; he also noted technical problems, such as screen-tearing and frame rate issues. Bloodworth criticized the game's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments, although he thought those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience. McCaffrey noted that even when the game is played in perfectionist mode, it is less challenging than its predecessors. He thought \"Blacklist\" gave players too many rewards, making its universal-economy system a useless feature. Bloodworth was puzzled by the game's unlock system, which he said hindered its credibility.\n\nUbisoft hoped that \"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist\" would sell at least five million copies. The game debuted at number two on the UK retail software sales chart in its first week of release, behind \"Saints Row IV\". It was August's fourth-bestselling game in the United States. On October 16, 2013 Ubisoft announced that \"Blacklist\" had failed to meet sales expectations, and on November 13 it was announced that the game had sold two million copies worldwide.\n"}
{"id": "174001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174001", "title": "Tom Ford", "text": "Tom Ford\n\nThomas Carlyle Ford (born August 27, 1961) is an American fashion designer, film director, screenwriter, and film producer. He launched his eponymous luxury brand in 2006, having previously served as the Creative Director at luxury fashion houses Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. Ford also directed the Academy Award-nominated films \"A Single Man\" (2009) and \"Nocturnal Animals\" (2016).\n\nTom Ford was born on August 27, 1961, in Austin, Texas, the son of realtors Shirley Burton (née Shirley Ann Thrasher) and Thomas David Ford. He spent his early life in the suburbs of Houston, Texas, and in San Marcos, outside Austin; his family moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, when he was 11. In Santa Fe, he entered St. Michael's High School and later moved to Santa Fe Preparatory School, from which he graduated in 1979.\n\nAt age 16, he enrolled at Bard College at Simon's Rock, but quickly dropped out. He moved to New York City to study art history at New York University (NYU). Ford dropped out of NYU after a year, focusing on acting in television commercials.\n\nFord began studying interior architecture at The New School's art and design college, Parsons The New School for Design in New York City. While in New York, he often visited Studio 54, where he realized he was gay. The club's disco-era glamor would be a major influence on his later designs. Before his last year at New School, Ford spent a year and a half in Paris, where he worked as an intern in Chloé's press office, inspiring his interest in fashion. He spent his final year at The New School studying fashion, but graduated with a degree in architecture.\n\nWhen interviewing for jobs after graduation, Ford said that he had attended The New School's Parsons division, but concealed that he graduated in architecture, and that his work at Chloé was a low-level public relations position. Despite his lack of experience in fashion, Ford called American designer Cathy Hardwick every day for a month in hopes of securing a job at her sportswear company. Hardwick eventually agreed to interview him. She later recalled the incident: \"I had every intention of giving him no hope. I asked him who his favorite European designers were. He said, 'Armani and Chanel.' Months later I asked him why he said that, and he said, 'Because you were wearing something Armani'. Is it any wonder he got the job?\" Ford worked as a design assistant for Hardwick for two years.\n\nIn 1988, Ford moved to Perry Ellis, where he knew both Robert McDonald, the company's president, and Marc Jacobs, its designer, socially. He worked at the company for two years, but grew tired of working in American fashion. In a later interview with \"The New York Times\", he commented, \"If I was ever going to become a good designer, I had to leave America. My own culture was inhibiting me. Too much style in America is tacky. It's looked down upon to be too stylish. Europeans, however, appreciate style.\"\n\nAt the time, Italian fashion house Gucci was struggling financially and was seeking to strengthen its women's ready-to-wear presence as a part of a brand overhaul. The company's creative director, Dawn Mello said, \"no one would dream of wearing Gucci\". In 1990, Mello hired Ford as the brand's chief women's ready-to-wear designer and Ford moved to Milan. \"I was talking to a lot of people, and most didn't want the job,\" Mello said. \"For an American designer to move to Italy to join a company that was far from being a brand would have been pretty risky.\" Ford and his longtime partner, fashion journalist Richard Buckley, relocated to Milan that September.\n\nFord's role at Gucci rapidly expanded; he was designing menswear within six months, and shoes soon after that. When Richard Lambertson left as design director in 1992, Ford took over his position, heading the brand's ready-to-wear, fragrances, image, advertising, and store design. In 1993, when he was in charge of designing eleven product lines, Ford worked eighteen-hour days. During these years, there were creative tensions between Ford and Maurizio Gucci, the company's chairman and 50% owner. According to Mello, \"Maurizio always wanted everything to be round and brown, and Tom wanted to make it square and black.\" Though Maurizio Gucci wanted to fire Ford, Domenico De Sole insisted that he remain. Nonetheless, Ford's work during the early 1990s was primarily behind the scenes; his contributions to Gucci were overshadowed by those of Mello, who was the company's public face.\n\nIn 1994, Ford was promoted to Creative Director of Gucci. In his first year at the helm, he introduced Halston-style velvet hipsters, skinny satin shirts and car-finish metallic patent boots. In 1995, he brought in French stylist Carine Roitfeld and photographer Mario Testino to create a series of new ad campaigns for the company. Between 1995 and 1996, sales at Gucci increased by 90%. At one point, Ford was the largest individual shareholder of Gucci stock and options. By 1999, the house, which had been almost bankrupt when Ford joined, was valued at more than $4 billion.\n\nWhen Gucci acquired the house of Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) in 1999, Ford was named Creative Director of that label as well. Saint Laurent did not hide his displeasure with Ford's designs, stating \"The poor man does what he can\". During his time as creative director for YSL, Ford nonetheless won numerous Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards. Like his work at Gucci, Ford was able to pull the classic fashion house back into the mainstream. His advertising campaigns for the YSL fragrances Opium (with a red-haired Sophie Dahl completely naked wearing only a necklace and stiletto heels in a sexually suggestive pose) and YSL M7 (with martial arts champion Samuel de Cubber in complete full-frontal nudity) were controversial and provocative.\n\nIn April 2004, Ford parted ways with the Gucci group after he and CEO Domenico de Sole, who is credited as Ford's partner in Gucci's success, failed to agree with Pinault Printemps Redoute boss over control of the Group. He has since referred to this experience as \"devastating\" and as a \"midlife crisis\" because he had \"put everything into that for fifteen years.\" When Ford left in 2004, Gucci Group was valued at $10 billion. Four people were hired to split the work Ford had done.\n\nAfter leaving Gucci, Ford launched a line of menswear, beauty, eyewear, and accessories in 2006, named after himself, \"Tom Ford\". Dominico De Sole became chairman of the Tom Ford label. Ford has described \"the Tom Ford customer\" as international, cultured, well traveled, and possessing disposable income. For women, he added \"strong women, … intelligent women who know their own style\".\n\nMichelle Obama wore an ivory floor-length evening gown designed by Ford to Buckingham Palace in 2011. Ford has also dressed Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Hathaway, Daniel Craig, Tom Hanks, Johnny Depp, Ryan Gosling, Will Smith, Julianne Moore, Hugh Jackman, Jon Hamm, and Henry Cavill. Ford designed Daniel Craig's suits for his last three James Bond films: \"Quantum of Solace\", \"Skyfall\", and \"Spectre\".\n\nIn 2013, Tom Ford was mentioned in Justin Timberlake's song \"Suit & Tie\", which was a collaboration with Jay Z. Ford created the suits, shirts, and accessories for the Grammy winning \"Suit & Tie\" music video. He went on to dress Timberlake's 20/20 Experience World Tour, designing over 600 pieces for the tour. The same year, Jay Z released a song titled \"Tom Ford\" with \"Tom Ford\" rapped numerous times within the song. Ford responded that he was flattered and \"it means that one has really penetrated and made an impact on popular culture.\" Following the song's release, Tom Ford received a huge spike in online search engine queries. The song would go on to sell over a million copies and become certified platinum.\n\nFord has been criticized for using naked women in various ad campaigns. Various journalists asserted that the ads were vulgar, sexist, or objectified women. One ad featured a nude woman holding a bottle of the perfume between her legs. Another featured a naked woman ironing a man's pants while he read a newspaper. A separate ad was banned in Italy.\n\nResponding to criticism that he objectified women, Ford stated he is an \"equal opportunity objectifier\" and is \"just as happy to objectify men\". He argued \"you can't show male nudity in our culture in the way you can show female nudity\" and pointed out that he did a male nude ad while at Yves Saint Laurent which got pulled.\n\nIn 2014, Ford released a new product, called the \"Penis Pendant Necklace\". The product caused some controversy, with Christians calling it offensive due to the pendant being shaped similar to a Christian cross or crucifix. Ford replied that \"it was not meant to be a cross, it was a phallus\" and \"people read into things what they want to\".\n\nIn March 2005, Ford announced the launch of his film production company, Fade to Black. In 2009 he made his directorial debut with \"A Single Man\", based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Isherwood. The drama stars Colin Firth as an LA-based, gay college professor, alongside Julianne Moore, Nicholas Hoult and Matthew Goode.

{"id": "501611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=501611", "title": "Twins in mythology", "text": "Twins in mythology\n\nTwins appear in the mythologies of many cultures around the world. In some they are seen as ominous and in others they are seen as auspicious. Twins in mythology are often cast as two halves of the same whole, sharing a bond deeper than that of ordinary siblings, or otherwise shown as fierce rivals. Twins can represents some \"other\" aspect of the Self, a doppelgänger or a shadow. The twin may be a brother soul-mate, such as the \"civilized\" Gilgamesh and the \"wild\" Enkidu. Or, sometimes one twin is the \"evil twin\" while the other side represents \"good\".\n\nMany cultures have mythic or folkloric explanations for how twins are conceived. In Greek mythology, some twins were conceived when a woman slept with both a mortal and a god on the same day. One of her offspring thereafter had godlike qualities, and the other was an ordinary mortal, such as Heracles and his twin brother Iphicles. In several Native American cultures women avoided eating twin fruits like double almonds and bananas because it was thought to increase the likelihood of twins. In other cultures, twins were attributed to superior virility of the father.\n\nTwins can represent the dualistic nature of the universe. In Greek mythology, Apollo and Artemis are twins, and Apollo was adopted as the sun god with Artemis as the moon goddess. In Hinduism, the Ashwini Twins or Ashvins are the Healers who are also offered sacrificial offerings or oblations as per the Rig Veda. Also, Yama and Yami, elder siblings of the Ashvins, are a brother-sister twin pair. In Xingu mythology of Brazil, the twin brothers Kuat and Iae forced the evil king Urubutsin to give light to the world, and Kuat became the sun with Iae as the moon. In one version of the Egyptian creation myth, the earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut were twins. In Zoroastrian mythology, the twins Ahriman and Ahura Mazda represent the spirits of evil and good respectively. Cultures with rival twin heroes often follow this pattern of split moral forces. In a myth of several northeastern Native American tribes, Gluskap, the creator god and cultural hero, has to defeat Malsum, his evil twin, who was the ruler of the demons.\n\nTwins can also be shown as having special powers and deep bonds. In Greek mythology, Castor and Pollux share a bond so strong that when Castor dies, Pollux gives up half of his immortality to be with his brother. This etiologically explains why their constellation, the Dioskouroi or Gemini, is only seen during one half of the year, as the twins split their time between the underworld and Mount Olympus. In an aboriginal tale, the same constellation represents the twin lizards who created the plants and animals and saved women from evil spirits. To the Dogon of Mali in West Africa, twinship represents completeness and perfection, symbolized by the deity Nummo. Nummo is actually a set of twins, male and female, and because the creation of the world required a sacrifice, humans can only be one half of the whole, male or female. In many Native American stories, twins are often partners on adventures such as quests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "996178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=996178", "title": "Veche", "text": "Veche\n\nVeche (, , , , ) was a popular assembly in medieval Slavic countries.\n\nIn Novgorod, where the veche acquired great prominence, the veche was broadly similar to the Norse thing or the Swiss Landsgemeinde.\n\nThe word is inherited from Proto-Slavonic *\"větje \", meaning 'council', 'counsel' or 'talk' (which is also represented in the word \"soviet\", both ultimately deriving from Proto-Slavic verbal stem of *větiti 'to talk, speak'). There exists misinformation claiming a relation to \"-vice\" in \"advice\", and somewhat more distantly to Sanskrit \"Veda\", Germanic words like \"wise\" (English), \"weten\" (Dutch, \"to know\"), \"witch\" (Slavonic: \"věšt-ica\") and many others, which however come from a different Indo-European root. Likewise, there exists misinformation claiming that the semantic derivation that yields the meaning of the word under consideration is parallel to that of \"congregation\". The contemporary words \"svedeniya\" () and \"svidchennya\" () both meaning \"information\" are cognates of this word.\n\nThe East Slavic veche is thought to have originated in tribal assemblies of Eastern Europe, thus predating the Rus' state.\nThe earliest mentions of \"veche\" in East European chronicles refer to examples in Belgorod Kievsky in 997, Novgorod the Great in 1016 and in Kiev in 1068. The assemblies discussed matters of war and peace, adopted laws, and called for and expelled rulers. In Kiev, the veche was summoned in front of the Cathedral of St Sophia.\n\nIn Ukraine, the town \"viche\" was simply a gathering of community members to inform everybody of important events (\"vich-na-vich\" - eye-to-eye) and come up with a collective planning for the near future.\n\nThe veche was the highest legislature and judicial authority in the Republic of Novgorod until 1478, after the conquest of Novgorod by Grand Prince Ivan III.\n\nThe traditional scholarship goes on to argue that a series of reforms in 1410 transformed the veche into something similar to the public assembly of Venice; it became the Commons or lower chamber of the parliament. An upper Senate-like Council of Lords (\"sovet gospod\") was also created, with title membership for all former city magistrates (\"posadniks\" and \"tysyatskys\"). Some sources indicate that veche membership may have become full-time, and parliament deputies were now called \"vechniks\". Some of the more recent scholars call this interpretation into question.\n\nThe Novgorod assembly could be presumably summoned by anyone who rang the veche bell, although it is more likely that the common procedure was more complex. The whole population of the city - boyars, merchants, and common citizens - then gathered at Yaroslav's Court or in front of the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom (the latter called a \"Vladychnoe veche\" - \"An Archbishop's Veche,\" since it was called in front of the cathedral). The veche bell was a symbol of republican sovereignty and independence and for this reason, Ivan III carted it off to Moscow when he took control of the city, to show that the old way of doing things was at an end.\n\nSeparate assemblies could be held in the boroughs or \"Ends\" of Novgorod.\n\nOf all other towns of Novgorod Land, the chronicles only mention a veche in Torzhok, however possibly they existed in all other towns as well.\n\nIn the Pskov Republic the veche continued until 1510, when that city was taken over by Grand Prince Vasilii III (1505–1533). In Pskov the veche assembled in the court of the Trinity cathedral.\n\nVeches, known in Poland as wiece, were convened even before the beginning of the Polish statehood in the Kingdom of Poland. Issues were first debated by the elders and leaders, and later presented to all the free men for a wider discussion.\n\nOne of the major types of wiec was the one convened to choose a new ruler. There are legends of a 9th-century election of the legendary founder of the Piast dynasty, Piast the Wheelwright, and a similar election of his son, Siemowit (this would place a Polish ruler's election a century before an Icelandic one's by the Althing), but sources for that time come from the later centuries and their validity is disputed by scholars. The election privilege was usually limited to the elites, which in the later times took the form of the most powerful nobles (magnates, princes) or officials, and was heavily influenced by local traditions and strength of the ruler. By the 12th or 13th centuries, the \"wiec\" institution likewise limited its participation to high ranking nobles and officials. The nationwide gatherings of \"wiec\" officials in 1306 and 1310 can be seen as precursors of the Polish parliament (the general sejm).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29005760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29005760", "title": "World Learning", "text": "World Learning\n\nWorld Learning is a 501(c)(3) international nonprofit organization that focuses on international development, education, and exchange programs. Based in Brattleboro, Vermont, World Learning \"unlocks the potential of people to address critical global issues\" through its five core program areas: The Experiment in International Living, SIT Study Abroad (including the International Honors Program), the SIT Graduate Institute (formerly the School for International Training), and International Development and Exchange Programs.\n\nThe Experiment in International Living (EIL) began in 1932. It had its origins in preparing outbound Peace Corps Volunteers for their assignments and was the first international exchange program to involve a family homestay. EIL was selected by the original architects of the Peace Corps, because the professionals at EIL were known to have a strong system for teaching the nuances of culture shock preparedness. Experiment assisted after World War II when they lead teaching voyages on a series of decommissioned warships with the members of the Student Council on Travel.\n\nThe School for International Training (SIT) was established in 1964. SIT filled a need of returned Peace Corps volunteers by offering a graduate degree in International Development. The Vermont campus originally consisted of a small collection of dorms around a Carriage House on a scenic farm on the north end of Brattleboro. These early Peace Corps volunteers took lessons in foreign languages with materials and teachers from the language training from their service, and The School for International Training began to expand its offerings. By 1968, the small but increasing number of returned Peace Corps volunteers were requesting a degree in Teaching English as a Second Language, a new speciality. In 1969, two graduate programs were developed, International Career Training (ICT), and Masters in Teaching Languages (MAT) (French, Spanish and ESL).\n\nIn the late 1970s, the 1980s, and 1990s there was an undergraduate program called the World Issues Program (WIP). It was a two-year program for transfer juniors and seniors. During the early years, a group of students published a book entitled \"Process: About Learning and Caring\" which speaks about the difficulties and rewards of transformational education.\n\nInspired by a speech by United Nations leader U Thant, the program provided classes in Peace and Conflict Studies, Alternative Energy Sources, Population Studies, International Economics and Environmental Studies. After the first year spent on campus, students had year-long internships in different sites around the world. The final semester consisted of research into one of these areas on a topic of the student's choice, and presentations of research results. The program was usually completed through submission of a Bachelor's Thesis or combination of projects. After 22 graduating classes, nearby Marlboro College adopted this program and offered it on their campus.\n\nThe International Visitor Leadership Project has brought community activists, legislators and regional leaders to campus to study the means of bringing peace to such war-torn places as Rwanda, Ireland, Bosnia or Israel/Palestine.\n\nThe Experiment in International Living is the longest functioning exchange program and has paved the way into a more peaceful and just world, by transforming students though international experiences and homestays.EIL\n\nSIT Graduate Institute is the accredited master's degree program of World Learning, offering Master of Arts degrees in Conflict Transformation; International Education; Sustainable Development; Intercultural Service, Leadership and Management; and Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL).\n\nSIT Study Abroad offers undergraduate programs overseas in more than 60 countries. The Study Abroad program has begun the journeys of many notable recipients of fellowships and prestigious education and platforms.SIT Study Abroad. The International Honors Program is a new member of the SIT Study Abroad portfolio, leading programs in studying and traveling with multiple destinations.IHP\n\nInternational Professional, Academic, and Cultural Exchanges works to bridge differences through citizen diplomacy.The program is actively engaged on a daily basis in promoting global understanding \"one handshake at a time,\" the World Learning Visitor Exchange Program (formerly Delphi International) facilitates citizen diplomacy through exchange programs for adults and young leaders.IPAE\n\nInternational Development Programs As a part of an extensive international NGO network, World Learning also has International Development Programs (IDEP) which focus on capacity building in International Development in 20 countries.World Learning - IDEP\n\nReporting of US Federal educational institution statistics continues under the name, School for International Training, but some data (though apparently not for enrollment) may pertain to both the SIT Graduate Institute and SIT Study Abroad.\n\nWorld Learning currently operates about 200 programs in 70 countries.\n\nWorld Learning's main campus is located in northern Brattleboro, on a country estate developed at the turn of the 20th century as a gentleman's farm. A core portion of the campus, including the original 20-room mansion house and early 1900s farm complex, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Dickinson Estate Historic District.\n\n"}
