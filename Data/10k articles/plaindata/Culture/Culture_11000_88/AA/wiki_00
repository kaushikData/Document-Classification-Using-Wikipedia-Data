{"id": "51843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51843", "title": "Acme Corporation", "text": "Acme Corporation\n\nThe Acme Corporation is a fictional corporation that features prominently in the \"Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote\" animated shorts as a running gag featuring outlandish products that fail or backfire catastrophically at the worst possible times. The name is also used as a generic title in many cartoons, especially those made by Warner Bros., and films, TV series, commercials and comic strips.\n\nThe company name in the \"Road Runner\" cartoons is ironic, since the word \"acme\" is derived from Greek (ακμή; English transliteration: \"akmē\") meaning \"the peak\", \"zenith\" or \"prime\", yet products from the fictional Acme Corporation are often generic, failure-prone, and/or explosive.\n\nAcme means \"pinnacle\", so the name was sometimes used to symbolize the best. An early global Acme brand name was the 'Acme City' whistle made from mid 1870s onwards by J Hudson & Co, followed by the 'Acme Thunderer', and Acme Siren in 1895. The name became particularly popular for businesses in the 1920s, when alphabetized business telephone directories such as the Yellow Pages began to be widespread: a name at the beginning of the alphabet would be listed first, and a name implying \"the best\" was even better. There was a flood of businesses named Acme; some survive to this day, including Acme Brick, Acme Markets, and Acme Boots. Early Sears catalogues contained a number of products with the \"Acme\" trademark, including anvils, which are frequently used in Warner Bros. cartoons. The ubiquitousness of the name became something of a joke.\n\nWarner Brothers animator Chuck Jones has said the name Acme was chosen because of its prevalence:\n\nThe name Acme also had other connotations for people in Los Angeles at the time. During the time the Warner Bros. cartoons were being produced, the traffic lights in Los Angeles were manufactured by the Acme Traffic Signal Company. The traffic lights paired \"Stop\" and \"Go\" semaphore arms with small red and green lights. Bells played the role of today's amber or yellow lights, ringing when the flags changed—a process that took five seconds. The Acme semaphore traffic lights were often used in Warner Bros.' \"Looney Tunes\" and \"Merrie Melodies\" cartoons for comedic effect due to their loud bell which was often followed by screeching tires and many sight gags.\n\nIt is a misconception that Acme is an acronym standing for such things as \"A Company Making Everything\", \"American Companies Make Everything\" or \"American Company that Manufactures Everything\".\n\nThe company is never clearly defined in \"Road Runner\" cartoons but appears to be a conglomerate which produces every product type imaginable, no matter how elaborate or extravagant—most of which never work as desired or expected (some products do work very well, but backfire against the coyote). In the \"Road Runner\" cartoon \"Beep, Beep\", it was referred to as \"Acme Rocket-Powered Products, Inc.\" based in Fairfield, New Jersey. Many of its products appear to be produced specifically for Wile E. Coyote; for example, the Acme Giant Rubber Band, subtitled \"(For Tripping Road Runners)\".\n\nWhile their products leave much to be desired, Acme delivery service is second to none; Wile E. can merely drop an order into a mailbox (or enter an order on a website, as in the \"\" movie), and have the product in his hands within seconds.\n\nThe name \"Acme\" is used as a generic corporate name in a huge number of cartoons, comics, television shows, such as an early episode of \"I Love Lucy\", and film, from the silent era onward in such titles as Buster Keaton's silent film \"Neighbors\" (1920) and Harold Lloyd's \"Grandma's Boy\" (1922).\n\nExamples which specifically reference the Wile E. Coyote cartoon character include:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Serbian minister Ilija Garašanin's \"Načertanije\" (1844) claimed lands that were inhabited by Bulgarians, Macedonians, Albanians, Montenegrins, Bosnians, Hungarians and Croats were part of Serbia. Garašanin's plan also includes methods of spreading Serbian influence in the claimed lands. He proposed ways to influence Croats, who Garašanin regarded as \"Serbs of Catholic faith\". This plan considered surrounding peoples to be devoid of national consciousness. Vuk Karadžić in the 1850s then denied the existence of Croatians and Croatian language, counting them as \"Catholic Serbs\". Croatia was at the time a kingdom in Habsburg Monarchy, with Dalmatia and Istria being separate Habsburg Crown lands. Ante Starčević, head of the Croatian Party of Rights, advocated for Croatia as a nation. After Austro-Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878 and Serbia gained its independence from Ottoman Empire, Croatian and Serbian relations deteriorated as both sides had pretensions on Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1902 there was a reprinted article written by Serb Nikola Stojanović that was published in the publication of the Serbian Independent Party from Zagreb titled \"Do istrage vaše ili naše\" (\"Till the Destruction, ours or yours\") in which denying of the existence of Croat nation as well as forecasting the result of the \"inevitable\" Serbian-Croatian conflict occurred.\nDuring the 19th century, some Italian radical nationalists tried to promote the idea that a Croatian nation has no sound reason to exist: therefore the Slavic population on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea (Croats and Slovenes) should be Italianized, and the territory included in Italy.\n\nIn World War I, 8,579 male \"aliens of enemy nationality\" were interned, including 5,954 Austro-Hungarians, including ethnic Croats. Many of these internees were used for forced labour in internment camps, such as the Castle Mountain Internment Camp and the Eaton Internment Camp.\n\nThis law was primarily aimed at further restricting immigration of Southern Europeans and Eastern Europeans, especially Italians, Slavs (including Croats) and Eastern European Jews.\n\nFascist-led Italianization, or the forced assimilation of Italian culture on the ethnic Croat communities inhabiting the former Austro-Hungarian territories of the Julian March and areas of Dalmatia, as well as ethnically-mixed cities in Italy proper, such as Trieste, had already been initiated prior to World War II. The Anti-Slavic sentiment, perpetuated by Italian Fascism, led to the persecution of Croats, alongside ethnic Slovenes on ethnic and cultural grounds. \n\nIn September 1920, Mussolini said: .\n\nThis period of Fascist Italianization included the banning of the Croatian Language in administration and courts between 1923 and 1925, the Italianization of Croat given and surnames in 1926 and the dissolution of Croatian societies, financial co-operatives and banks. \n\nThis period was therefore characterised as \"centralising, oppressive and dedicated to the forcible Italianisation of the minorities\" consequently leading to the emigration of around 105,000 Slovenes and Croats from the Julian March, mostly to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (around 70,000), but also to Argentina (some 30,000). On the other hand, several thousand Dalmatian Italians moved from Yugoslavia to Italy after 1918, many of them to Istria and Trieste.\n\nFollowing the Axis Invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Italy occupied almost all of Dalmatia, as well as Gorski Kotar and the Italian government made stringent efforts to further Italianize the region. Italian occupying forces were accused of committing war crimes in order to transform occupied territories into ethnic Italian territories.. An example of this was the 1942 massacre in Podhum and Testa, when Italian forces murdered at least 108 Croat civilians and deported the remaining population to concentration camps.\n\nThe Italian government operated concentration camps for Slavic citizens, such as Rab concentration camp and one on the island of Molat. Survivors received no compensation from Italy after the war.\n\nChetnik ideology during World War II foresaw the need for the ethnic cleansing of certain areas in order to consolidate an ethnically \"pure\" Serb territory as the basis of post-War Yugoslavia. This ethnic cleansing was supposed to be conducted \"at a convenient moment\", Croats alongside Bosniaks were to be targeted as part of this policy. One of the numerous documents that attest to this plan is Mihailović's written \"instruction\" to Pavle Đurišić from 20 December 1941:\n\nThe basic precondition for creating an ethnically clean area was the securing of a pure Serbian ethnic state and the ethnic cleansing of the area inhabited by Croats and Bosniaks. Ustase lead massacres of Serb civilians accelerated Chetnik cleansings in the Bosnia region leading to more volunteers in the Chetnik army. Similarly, Chetnik atrocities lead to larger Ustase volunteers.\n\nRegarding the realization of his Greater Serbian program Homogenous Serbia, Stevan Moljević wrote in his letter to Dragiša Vasić in February 1942:\n\nIt is clear from the documents of the Chetnik commanders that the real reason for the terror against the non-Serb population was the desire to establish an ethnically pure Greater Serbia in the historical territory of many peoples, most notably Croatian, Muslim, but also Bulgarian, Romanian, Hungarian, Macedonian, Montenegrin and others and not crimes over the Serbs in NDH as Chetniks officially claimed. Draža Mihailović went even further from Moljević and requested more than 90% of the NDH's territory where more than 2,500,000 Catholics and more than 800,000 Muslims lived, accounting for about 70% of the total population with Orthodox Serbs making up only about 30% of the population.\n\nIn the context of Chetnik genocide, one of the main Chetnik commanders Milan Šantić stated in Trebinje in July 1942: \"The Serb lands must be cleansed from Catholics and Muslims. They will be inhabited only by the Serbs. Cleansing will be carried out thoroughly, and we will suppress and destroy them all without exception and without pity, which will be the starting point for our liberation.\" \n\nIn the \"Elaborate\" of the \"Chetnik's Dinaric Battalion\" from March 1942, it's stated that Chetnik's main goal was to create a \"Serbian national state in the areas in which the Serbs live, and even those to which Serbs aspire (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lika and part of Dalmatia)\" where \"only Orthodox population would live\". It is also stated that Bosniaks should be convinced that Serbs are their allies, so they wouldn't join the Partisans, and then kill them.\"\n\nAccording to Bajo Stanišić, the final goal of the Chetniks was \"founding of a new Serbian state, not a geographical term but a purely Serbian, with four basic attributes: the Serbian state [Greater Serbia], the Serb King [of] the Karađorđević dynasty, Serbian nationality, and Serbian faith. The Balkan federation is also the next stage, but the main axis and leadership of this federation must be our Serbian state, that is, the Greater Serbia.\"\n\nChetnik ethnic cleansing targeted Croat civilians throughout areas of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which Croats were massacred and expelled, some examples of which include: Krnjeuša massacre, Trubar massacre, Bosansko Grahovo massacre and the Gata massacre. According to the Croatian historian, Vladimir Žerjavić, Chetnik forces killed between 18,000-32,000 Croats during World War II, predominantly civilians .\n\nAfter Serbian President Slobodan Milošević's assumption of power in 1989 various Chetnik groups made a \"comeback\" and his regime \"made a decisive contribution to launching the Chetnik insurrection in 1990–1992 and to funding it thereafter\". Chetnik ideology was influenced by the memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. On 28 June 1989, the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo, Serbs in north Dalmatia, Knin, Obrovac, and Benkovac where there were \"old Chetnik strongholds\" held the first anti-Croatian government demonstrations. On the same day, Chetnik commander from WWII Momčilo Đujić declared Vojislav Šešelj \"at once assumes the role of a vojvoda and a vladika [high-ranking religious order] unifier\" and ordered him \"to expel all Croats, Albanians, and other foreign elements from holy Serbian soil\", stating he would return only when Serbia was cleansed of \"the last Jew, Albanian, and Croat\".\n\nThe Hague Tribunal found that about 170,000 Croats were expelled from parts of Croatia, Serbian forces sought to control. Rebel Croatian Serbs' forces together with Serbian military and paramilitary forces committed numerous war crimes and massacres in Republic of Croatia. According to the Croatian Association of Prisoners in Serbian Concentration Camps, a total of 8,000 Croatian civilians and Prisoners of war (a large number after the fall of Vukovar) went through Serb prison camps such as Sremska Mitrovica camp, Stajićevo camp, Niš camp and many others where many were heavily abused and tortured. A total of 300 people never returned from them. A total of 4,570 camp inmates started legal action against former Serbia and Montenegro (now Serbia) for torture and abuse in the camps.\n\nFrom territories occupied by Serbs in 1991, around 700,000 people were expelled or fled. 16,000 Croats (including civilians) were killed during the war, largely through massacres and bombings. Croatia regained control over most of occupied territories in 1995.\n\nVojislav Seselj, a radical Serbian nationalist, is a major proponent of a Greater Serbia with no ethnic minorities, but “ethnic unity and harmony among Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Serbs, Muslim Serbs and atheist Serbs\".\nIn late 1991, during the Battle of Vukovar, Šešelj went to Borovo Selo to meet with a Serbian Orthodox Church bishop and publicly described Croats as a genocidal and perverted people. \nIn May and July 1992, Šešelj visited the Vojvodina village of Hrtkovci and publicly started the campaign of persecution of local ethnic Croats.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "525009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=525009", "title": "Aptitude", "text": "Aptitude\n\nAn aptitude is a component of a competence to do a certain kind of work at a certain level. Outstanding aptitude can be considered \"talent\". An aptitude may be physical or mental. Aptitude is inborn potential to do certain kinds of work whether developed or undeveloped. Ability is developed knowledge, understanding, learned or acquired abilities (skills) or attitude. The innate nature of aptitude is in contrast to skills and achievement, which represent knowledge or ability that is gained through learning.\n\nAccording to Gladwell (2008) and Colvin (2008), often it is difficult to set apart an outstanding performance due merely to talent or stemming from hard training. Talented people as a rule show high results immediately in few kinds of activity, but often only in a single direction or genre.\n\nAptitude and intelligence quotient are related, and in some ways differing views of human mental ability. Unlike the original idea of IQ, aptitude often refers to one of the many different characteristics which can be independent of each other, such as aptitude for military flight, air traffic control, or computer programming. This approach measures a variety of separate skills, similar to the theory of multiple intelligences and Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory and many other modern theories of intelligence. In general, aptitude tests are more likely to be designed and used for career and employment decisions, and intelligence tests are more likely to be used for educational and research purposes. However, there is a great deal of overlap between them, and they often measure the same kinds of abilities. For example, aptitude tests such as the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery measure enough aptitudes that they could also serve as a measure of general intelligence.\n\nA single construct such as mental ability is measured with multiple tests. Often, a person's group of test scores will be highly correlated with each other, which makes a single measure useful in many cases. For example, the U.S. Department of Labor's General Learning Ability is determined by combining Verbal, Numerical and Spatial aptitude scores. However, many individuals have skills that are a lot higher or lower than their overall mental ability level. Aptitude subtests are used intra-individually to determine which tasks that individual is more skilled at performing. This information can be useful for determining which job roles are the best fits for employees or applicants. Often, before more rigorous aptitude tests are used, individuals are screened for a basic level of aptitude through a previously-completed process, such as SAT scores, GRE scores, GATE scores, degrees, or other certifications.\n\nTests that assess learned skills or knowledge are frequently called achievement tests. However, certain tests can assess both types of constructs. An example that leans both ways is the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), which is given to recruits entering the armed forces of the United States. Another is the SAT, which is designed as a test of aptitude for college in the United States, but has achievement elements. For example, it tests mathematical reasoning, which depends both on innate mathematical ability and education received in mathematics.\n\nAptitude tests can typically be grouped according to the type of cognitive ability they measure: \n\n\n"}

The community traces its origins to the dynasty founded in 1654 by Sherkhanji Babi (ruled 1654–1690). The last Nawab of Junagadh left India after the Partition in 1947.\n\nThey entered India from Khorasan under the leadership of Usman Khan, a follower of Mughal emperor Humayun. Bahadur Khanji Babi, son of Usman Khan, migrated to India and entered service under the Mughals. The hereditary title (Tribe) of Babi was conferred to him in 1554 from Emperor Humayun, for \"services against the Rana of Chittor\". Sherkhanji Babi, founder of the Babi dynasty in 1654, arrived in Kathiawar in the train of Prince Murad Baksh, the Imperial Viceroy and son of Shah Jahan.\n\nBabi Tribe is a Pashtun tribe which originates from eastern Afghanistan and western regions of Pakistan. Babi or Babai (Pashtun tribe) is son of Ghorghasht or Gharghashti. Babi Pathans claim to have arrived in Gujarat during the rule of Shah Jahan. After the collapse of the Mughal Empire, the Babis were involved in a struggle with the Gaekwad dynasty of the Maratha Empire for control of Gujarat. While the Marathas were successful in establishing control over all of Gujarat, the Babis retained sovereignty of the princely states of Junagadh, Radhanpur, Balasinor and Manavadar.\n\nBabi descendants are found throughout north Gujarat and Saurashtra. Iconic Bollywood actress Parveen Babi was of Babi lineage, but most contemporary Babis, barring those belonging to princely lineages, are in modest circumstances. Many are petty landowners, but there is marked urbanization among the Babi as well. Though the Babis observe a tradition of endogamy, but there are cases of marriages with the Chauhan and Behlim communities, and they accept daughters from the Shaikhs and Sunni Bohras.\n\nMembers of this dynasty ruled over the princely states of Junagadh, Radhanpur and Balasinor, as well as the small states of Bantva Manavadar and Sardargarh.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47127", "title": "Baby boomers", "text": "Baby boomers\n\nBaby boomers (also known as boomers) are the demographic cohort following the Silent Generation and preceding Generation X. There are varying timelines defining the start and the end of this cohort; demographers and researchers typically use birth years starting from the early- to mid-1940s and ending anywhere from 1960 to 1964.\n\nThe term \"baby boomer\" is also used in a cultural context, so it is difficult to achieve broad consensus of a precise date definition. Different people, organizations, and scholars have varying opinions on who is a baby boomer, both chronologically and culturally. Some define \"baby boomers\" as those born between 1946 and 1964. \n\nBaby boomers are associated with a rejection or redefinition of traditional values. Many commentators, however, have disputed the extent of that rejection, noting the widespread continuity of values with older and younger generations. In Europe and North America, boomers are widely associated with privilege, as many grew up in a time of widespread government subsidies in post-war housing and education, and increasing affluence.\n\nAs a group, baby boomers were the wealthiest, most active, and most physically fit generation up to the era in which they arrived, and were amongst the first to grow up genuinely expecting the world to improve with time. They were also the generation that received peak levels of income; they could therefore reap the benefits of abundant levels of food, apparel, retirement programs, and sometimes even \"midlife crisis\" products. The increased consumerism for this generation has been regularly criticized as excessive.\n\nOne feature of the boomers was that they have tended to think of themselves as a special generation, very different from those that had come before or that has come afterward. In the 1960s, as the relatively large numbers of young people became teenagers and young adults, they, and those around them, created a very specific rhetoric around their cohort, and the changes they were bringing about. This rhetoric had an important impact in the self perceptions of the boomers, as well as their tendency to define the world in terms of generations, which was a relatively new phenomenon. The baby boom has been described variously as a \"shockwave\" and as \"the pig in the python\".\n\nThe term \"Generation Jones\" is sometimes used to describe those born roughly between 1954 and 1964. The term is typically used to refer to the later years of the Baby boomer cohort and the early years of Generation X.\n\nThe term baby boom refers to a noticeable increase in the birth rate. The post-war population increase was described as a \"boom\" by various newspaper reporters, including Sylvia F. Porter in a column for the May 4, 1951, edition of the \"New York Post\", based on the increase in the population of the U.S. of 2,357,000 in 1950. The first recorded use of \"baby boomer\" is in a January 1963 \"Daily Press\" article describing a massive surge of college enrollments approaching as the oldest boomers were coming of age.\n\nVarious authors have delimited the baby boom period differently. Landon Jones, in his book \"Great Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation\" (1980), defined the span of the baby-boom generation as extending from 1943 through 1960, when annual births increased over 4,000,000. Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, well known for their generational theory, define the social generation of Boomers as that cohort born from 1943 to 1960, who were too young to have any personal memory of World War II, but old enough to remember the postwar American High.\n\nPew Research Center defines baby boomers as being born between 1946 and 1964. In the U.S., the generation can be segmented into two broadly defined cohorts: The Leading-Edge Baby Boomers are individuals born between 1946 and 1955, those who came of age during the Vietnam War era. This group represents slightly more than half of the generation, or roughly 38,002,000 people of all races. The other half of the generation was born between 1956 and 1964. Called Late Boomers, or Trailing-Edge Boomers, this second cohort includes about 37,818,000 individuals, according to \"Live Births by Age and Mother and Race, 1933–98\", published by the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nAn ongoing battle for \"generational ownership\" has motivated a handful of marketing mavens and cultural commentators to coin and/or promote their own terms for sub‑segments of the baby-boomer generation. These monikers include, but are not limited to, \"golden boomers,\" \"generation Jones,\" \"alpha boomers,\" \"hippies,\" \"yippies,\" \"yuppies,\" \"zoomers,\" and \"cuspers.\"\n\nIn Ontario, Canada, one attempt to define the boom came from David Foot, author of \"Boom, Bust and Echo: Profiting from the Demographic Shift in the 21st century\" (1997). He defines a Canadian boomer as someone born from 1947 to 1966, the years that more than 400,000 babies were born. However, he acknowledges that is a demographic definition, and that culturally it may not be as clear-cut.\n\nDoug Owram argues that the Canadian boom took place from 1942 to 1960, but that culturally boomers everywhere were born between the late war years and about 1955 or 1956. He notes that those born in the years before the actual boom were often the most influential people among boomers; for example, musicians such as The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and The Rolling Stones, as well as writers like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, who were either slightly or vastly older than the boomer generation. Those born in the 1960s might feel disconnected from the cultural identifiers of the earlier boomers.\n\nBernard Salt places the Australian baby boom between 1943 and 1960, while the Australian Bureau of Statistics defines the boom as 1946 to 1964.\n\n76 million Americans were born between 1946 and 1964, representing a cohort that is significant in size alone. In 2004, the British baby boomers held 80% of the UK's wealth and bought 80% of all high-end cars, 80% of cruises and 50% of skincare products.\n\nIn addition to the size of the group, Steve Gillon has suggested that one thing that sets the baby boomers apart from other generational groups is the fact that \"almost from the time they were conceived, Boomers were dissected, analyzed, and pitched to by modern marketers, who reinforced a sense of generational distinctiveness.\" This is supported by the articles of the late 1940s identifying the increasing number of babies as an economic boom, such as a 1948 \"Newsweek\" article whose title proclaimed \"Babies Mean Business\", or a 1948 \"Time\" magazine article called \"Baby Boom.\"\n\nThe age wave theory suggests an economic slowdown when the boomers started retiring during 2007–2009. Projections for the aging U.S. workforce suggest that by 2020, 25% of employees will be at least 55 years old.\n\nThe Baby Boomers came into being the largest voting demographic in the early 1980s, a period which ushered in a long running trend of rapidly increasing income inequality. From 1979-2007, those receiving the highest 1 percentile of incomes saw their already large incomes increase by 278% while those in the middle at the 40th-60th percentiles saw a 35% increase. Since 1980, after the vast majority of Baby Boomer college goers graduated, the cost of college has been increased by over 600% (inflation adjusted).\n\nA survey found that nearly a third of baby boomer multimillionaires polled in the United States would prefer to pass on their inheritance to charities rather than pass it down to their children. Fifty-seven percent of these boomers believed it was important for each generation to earn their own money; fifty four percent believed it was more important to invest in their children while they were growing up.\n\nBoomers grew up at a time of dramatic social change. In the United States, that change marked the generation with a strong cultural cleavage, between the proponents of change and the more conservative individuals. Some analysts believe this cleavage played out politically since the time of the Vietnam War to the mid‑2000s, to some extent defining the political landscape and division in the country. Starting in the 1980s, the boomers became more conservative, many of them regretting the cultural changes they brought in their youth.\n\nIn 1993, \"Time\" magazine reported on the religious affiliations of baby boomers. Citing Wade Clark Roof, a sociologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, the articles stated that about 42% of baby boomers were dropouts from formal religion, 33% had never strayed from church, and 25% of boomers were returning to religious practice. The boomers returning to religion were \"usually less tied to tradition and less dependable as church members than the loyalists. They are also more liberal, which deepens rifts over issues like abortion and homosexuality.\"\n\nThe early and mid-boomers were coming of age at the same time across the world, so that they experienced events like Beatlemania and Woodstock, organizing against the Vietnam War, or fighting and dying in the same war. Boomers in Italy were dressing in mod clothes and \"buying the world a Coke.\" Boomers in India were seeking new philosophical discoveries. Some American boomers in Canada had found a new home after escaping the draft. Canadian Boomers were organizing support for Pierre Trudeau. It is precisely because of these experiences that many believe those born in the second half of the birth boom belong to another generation, as events that defined their coming of age have little in common with leading or core boomers.\nPolitically, early Boomers in the United States tend to be Democrats, while later boomers tend to be Republicans.\n\nThe baby boomers found that their music, most notably rock and roll, was another expression of their generational identity. Transistor radios were personal devices that allowed teenagers to listen to The Beatles, the Motown Sound, and other new musical directions and artists.\n\nIn the west, baby boomers comprised the first generation to grow up with the television; some popular Boomer-era shows included \"Howdy Doody\", \"The Mickey Mouse Club\", \"Captain Video\", \"The Soupy Sales Show\", \"The Brady Bunch\", \"Gilligan's Island\", \"The Twilight Zone\", \"Batman\", \"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In\", \"Star Trek\", \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", \"All in the Family\" and \"Happy Days\".\n\nIn the 1985 study of U.S. generational cohorts by Schuman and Scott, a broad sample of adults was asked, \"What world events over the past 50 years were especially important to them?\" For the baby boomers the results were:\n\nSome debate exists regarding the generational identity of those born from 1961 to 1964, as some demographers and researchers consider these individuals to be part of the younger demographic cohort, Generation X.\n\nThe density of Baby Boomers can put a strain on Medicare. According to the American Medical Student Association, the population of individuals over the age of 65 will increase by 73 percent between 2010 and 2030, meaning one in five Americans will be a senior citizen.\n\n, it was reported that, as a generation, boomers had tended to avoid discussions and long-term planning for their demise. However, beginning at least as early as that year, there has been a growing dialogue on how to manage aging and end-of-life issues as the generation ages. In particular, a number of commentators have argued that Baby Boomers are in a state of denial regarding their own aging and death and are leaving an undue economic burden on their children for their retirement and care. According to the 2011 Associated Press and LifeGoesStrong.com surveys:\nIn 2009, the earliest baby boomers (If someone uses Strauss and Howe's range of 1943-1960) reached a common retirement age in the United States: 66 years.\n\nAn indication of the importance put on the impact of the boomer was the selection by \"TIME\" magazine of the Baby Boom Generation as its 1966 \"Man of the Year.\" As Claire Raines points out in \"Beyond Generation X\", \"never before in history had youth been so idealized as they were at this moment.\" When Generation X came along it had much to live up to according to Raines.\n\nBoomers are often associated with the counterculture of the 1960s, the civil rights movement, and the \"second-wave\" feminist cause of the 1970s. Conversely, many trended in moderate to conservative directions opposite to the counterculture, especially those making professional careers in the military (officer and enlisted), law enforcement, business, blue collar trades, and Republican Party politics. They are also associated with the spending trends and narcissism of the \"Me\" generation.\n\nPeople often take it for granted that each succeeding generation will be \"better off\" than the one before it. When Generation X came along just after the boomers, they would be the first generation to enjoy a lesser quality of life than the generation preceding it.\n\nBaby boomers continue to have a significant effect on politics, as the United States presidential election, 2016 came down to two controversial candidates in Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, both boomers, with a majority of Trump's support coming from the Baby Boomer generation. Three American presidents were born in 1946: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Donald Trump.\n\nWithin the UK, numerous Baby Boomers have served as major party leaders, including four prime ministers (John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and Theresa May), and five leaders of the opposition (Neil Kinnock, Margaret Beckett, Tony Blair, Iain Duncan Smith and Jeremy Corbyn).\n\n\n\n"}

Bahá'í studies are currently conducted in a variety of venues, including institutes of the Bahá'í administration as well as non-affiliated universities. Some scholars study some aspect of the Bahá'í Faith as part of research on related matters while others engage in Bahá'í studies as a primary focus of their research. Scholars' comments on the religion and its predecessor Bábism date back to the at least 1845, the year after its founding. Initially they were often Orientalists or Christian missionaries but through time both Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'í researchers have addressed the religion especially in tune with the growth of the religion, which has been called significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of collections of Bahá'í related materials are preserved around the world. Some are maintained at universities; the Bahá'í World Center, especially at the Centre for the Study of the Sacred Texts, the International Archives, and International Bahá'í Library, most National Bahá'í Assemblies and many local Bahá'í assemblies or institutions maintain their own archives.\n\n\n\nA number of venues exist for publishing materials related to the Bahá'í Faith. Many national assemblies have their own publishing trust and there are a few publishing houses that run more or less independently. Among them are:\n\n\nStarting with the antecedent Bábísm religion, as viewed by Bahá'ís, scholarship on the religion began in its earliet days.\n\nWhile there were previous Iran or near-Iranian sources of scholarship of the religion in early periods, wide-ranging publications covering mostly western literature include Moojan Momens' 1981 The Babi and Baha'i Religions, 1844–1944: Some Contemporary Western Accounts, William Collins' 1992 Bibliography of English-language works on the Bábí and Bahá'í faiths, 1844–1985, and MacEoin's annotated bibliography borrowing heavily from Collins' work. There is also the Resource Guide for the Scholarly Study of the Bahá'í Faith by Robert Stockman and Jonah Winters published in 1997, focusing more on later works. Mostly these works explicitly ignored newspaper accounts.\n\nA wide variety of accounts, encounters and investigations began to circulate outside of Persia as events began to unfold from the Spring of 1844 with the Declaration of the Báb. Initially viewed as an Iranian development and often through Christian missionary perspectives, the growth of religion would soon far transcend that limited perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBahá'í scholars who are also members of the faith must submit their work for review by the Bahá'í administration and obtain prior approval. According to the administration of the religion, the purpose of the review is threefold:\n\n\nJuan Cole, a former Bahá'í who had disagreements with the Bahá'í administration on account of the review describes it as \"a system of in-house censorship\" which \"has provoked many conflicts between Bahá'í officials and writers over the years.\" There have been several conflicts originating from the practice of review, and a number of prominent academics, including Juan Cole, Denis MacEoin and Abbas Amanat, have either been excommunicated or forced to resign due to academic disagreements with the religious hierarchy. Denis MacEoin has said that the review has stifled research in Bahá'í studies. Moojan Momen, another academic in the field of Bahá'í Studies who has labeled Juan Cole and Denis MacEoin \"apostates,\" disagrees and states that \"there is no more 'censorship' involved in this process than with any other academic journal.\"\n"}

Put out by the Ledger Company and edited by Samuel H. Williams, the \"Ledger\" was a boilerplate literary magazine. Such periodicals were printed using engraved steel sheets. The plates, or casts of them, were then sent out to be printed and inserted into other newspapers. \"Ledger\" subscriptions originally sold for $1 for 52 issues and, by 1879, the paper had a circulation of 10,000. Although begun as a literary paper of \"a good class,\" the \"Ledger\" eventually became more melodramatic in tone. In his 1910 book, Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois, Franklin Scott, notes that \"[t]he sensational, although not immoral, character of the Ledger stories, and the use that the large mail-order houses have made of its advertising columns, have given this paper an unusually long life and extensive circulation.\"\n\nIn 1892, William D. Boyce, who helped to found the Boy Scouts of America and later the Lone Scouts of America, purchased the \"Ledger\" and turned it into a \"mail order\" paper. As such, the Ledger relied on advertising by direct mail retailers to support its publication. This kind of publication made money without a large initial outlay. The \"Ledger\" contained serialized fiction and short stories designed to appeal to the whole family. Later issues had a supplement called the \"Little Ledger\", which offered \"Useful Knowledge, Romance, and Amusement for Young People.\"\nThe W.D. Boyce Company operated from the \"second skyscraper in Chicago,\" at 30 North Dearborn Street until moving to the historic Boyce Building at 500-510 North Dearborn Street. Boyce sold the \"Chicago Ledger\" and \"The Saturday Blade\", known together as Boyce's Big Weeklies, through a network of news boys. They earned two cents per paper sold and were not charged for unsold issues. This system worked well for the company as it provided them with a sales force in rural areas and functioned in accordance with Boyce's philosophy of providing rural boys with advantages more easily accessed in cities. Their recruiting material bore the slogan, \"The best way to help a boy is to help him to help himself.\"\n\nContributors to the \"Chicago Ledger\" included Weldon J. Cobb, Harry Stephen Keeler, and Randall Parrish. Noted African-American author Charles W. Chesnutt wrote two short stories, \"The Doctor’s Wife\" and \"A Metropolitan Experience,\" published in June, 1887. Edward Stratemeyer, whose Stratemeyer Syndicate was responsible for such series as The Hardy Boys, The Bobbsey Twins, and Nancy Drew, contributed to The \"Chicago Ledger\" under the name Edna Winfield.\n\nIn 1925, Boyce's Big Weeklies merged to become the \"Blade and Ledger\". William D. Boyce died in 1929 in his penthouse apartment in the Boyce Building. The \"Blade & Ledger\" continued to be published monthly until 1937.\n\n"}

Their Chimila language is part of the Chibcha language family; there were estimated to be around 1000 speakers in 1998. At the time of the Spanish Conquest the Ariguaní River valley was the strategic centre of their territory. On the Serranía del Perijá mountains the Yukpas were also part of the Chimila confederation of tribes.\n\nAt the time of the Spanish colonization of the Americas they were established in most of the Cesar River basin and its valley (including Valledupar in the Cesar Department) between the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Serranía del Perijá mountain ranges and bordering the Magdalena River. A Chimila cacique at the time of the Conquest lent his name to the city of Chimichagua, Colombia, while another, \"Upar\", lent his name to Valledupar, via the Spanish (\"valley of Upar\"). The \"Cesar\" name of the Cesar River and Cesar Department is an adaptation from the Chimila indigenous word \"Chet-tzar\" or \"Zazare\" (\"calm water\") into Spanish, in reference to the Cesar River.\n\nThere were two major cities in the region; one was called \"Thamara\" (present-day Tamalameque) and the other was \"Upari\" named after their powerful chief. the cacique Upar. The Spanish scribes described Thamara as a very large city with more than a thousand huts. The Chimila society was structured in a pyramidal structure with a working class divided into fishers, hunters, artisans, miners, goldsmiths and merchants. The Chimilas used Arhuacos as their slaves. The Chimilas believed in an immortal figure called \"Masirguta\" and were monotheist believing in the god \"Narayajana\" (also referred to as \"Yao\"). Chimilas were practiced musical rites with drums of many sizes, flutes with a tip made out of wax varying in between two and five holes, imitated the singing of the rufous-vented chachalaca birds with an instrument called \"guacharaca\" and maracas.\n\nThe Chimilas cultivated the maize in a technical manner and to a lesser extent other local species of vegetables and fruits for consumption and certain trees near their huts to produces shadows and freshen their area. Chimilas also harvested the \"Gynerium sagittatum\", a cane used to produce bows and arrows.\n\nAround 1720 the Chimilas began a guerrilla war against the Spanish Empire. Violence continued well into the twentieth century. In 1990 a reservation called Issa Oristuna was created.\n\n"}

CETI) is a branch of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence that focuses on composing and deciphering interstellar messages that theoretically, could be understood by another technological civilization. This field of study once was known as \"exosemiotics\". The best-known CETI experiment of its kind was the 1974 Arecibo message composed by Frank Drake.\n\nThere are multiple independent organizations and individuals engaged in CETI research; the generic application of abbreviations CETI and SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) in this article should not be taken as referring to any particular organization (such as the SETI Institute).\n\nCETI research has focused on four broad areas: mathematical languages, pictorial systems such as the Arecibo message, algorithmic communication systems (ACETI), and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering \"natural\" language communication. There remain many undeciphered writing systems in human communication, such as Linear A, discovered by archeologists. Much of the research effort is directed at how to overcome similar problems of decipherment that arise in many scenarios of interplanetary communication.\n\nOn 13 February 2015, scientists (including Douglas Vakoch, David Grinspoon, Seth Shostak, and David Brin) at an annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, discussed Active SETI and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent extraterrestrials in the cosmos was a good idea. That same week, a statement was released, signed by many in the SETI community, that a \"worldwide scientific, political, and humanitarian discussion must occur before any message is sent\". On 28 March 2015, a related essay was written by Seth Shostak and published in \"The New York Times\".\n\nIn the 19th century there were many books and articles about the possible inhabitants of other planets. Many people believed that intelligent beings might live on the Moon, Mars, and Venus.\n\nSince travel to other planets was not possible at that time, some people suggested ways to signal the extraterrestrials even before radio was discovered. Carl Friedrich Gauss is often credited with an 1820 proposal suggested that a giant triangle and three squares, the Pythagoras, could be drawn on the Siberian tundra. The outlines of the shapes would have been ten-mile-wide strips of pine forest, the interiors could be rye or wheat. Joseph Johann Littrow proposed in 1819 to use the Sahara as a sort of blackboard. Giant trenches several hundred yards wide could delineate twenty-mile-wide shapes. Then the trenches would be filled with water, and then enough kerosene could be poured on top of the water to burn for six hours. Using this method, a different signal could be sent every night.\n\nMeanwhile, other astronomers were looking for signs of life on other planets. In 1822, Franz von Gruithuisen thought he saw a giant city and evidence of agriculture on the moon, but astronomers using more powerful instruments refuted his claims. Gruithuisen also believed he saw evidence of life on Venus. Ashen light had been observed on Venus, and he postulated that it was caused by a great fire festival put on by the inhabitants to celebrate their new emperor. Later he revised his position, stating that the Venusians could be burning their rainforest to make more farmland.\n\nBy the late 1800s, the possibility of life on the moon was put to rest. Astronomers at that time believed in the Kant-Laplace hypothesis, which stated that the farthest planets from the sun are the oldest—therefore Mars was more likely to have advanced civilizations than Venus. Subsequent investigations focused on contacting Martians. In 1877 Giovanni Schiaparelli announced he had discovered \"canali\" (\"channels\" in Italian, which occur naturally, and mistranslated as \"canals\", which are artificial) on Mars—this was followed by thirty years of Mars enthusiasm. Eventually the Martian canals proved illusory.\n\nThe inventor Charles Cros was convinced that pinpoints of light observed on Mars and Venus were the lights of large cities. He spent years of his life trying to get funding for a giant mirror with which to signal the Martians. The mirror would be focused on the Martian desert, where the intense reflected sunlight could be used to burn figures into the Martian sand.\n\nInventor Nikola Tesla mentioned many times during his career that he thought his inventions such as his Tesla coil, used in the role of a \"resonant receiver\", could communicate with other planets, and that he even had observed repetitive signals of what he believed were extraterrestrial radio communications coming from Venus or Mars in 1899. These \"signals\" turned out to be terrestrial radiation, however.\n\nAround 1900, the Guzman Prize was created; the first person to establish interplanetary communication would be awarded 100,000 francs under one stipulation: Mars was excluded because Madame Guzman thought communicating with Mars would be too easy to deserve a prize.\n\nPublished in 1960 by Hans Freudenthal, \"Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse\", expands upon Astraglossa to create a general-purpose language derived from basic mathematics and logic symbols. Several researchers have expanded further upon Freudenthal's work. A dictionary resembling Lincos was featured in the Carl Sagan novel \"Contact\" and film adaptation.\n\nPublished in 1963 by Lancelot Hogben, \"Astraglossa\" is an essay describing a system for combining numbers and operators in a series of short and long pulses. In Hogben's system, short pulses represent numbers, while trains of long pulses represent symbols for addition, subtraction, etc.\n\nIn the 1985 science fiction novel \"Contact\", Carl Sagan explored in some depth how a message might be constructed to allow communication with an alien civilization, using prime numbers as a starting point, followed by various universal principles and facts of mathematics and science.\n\nSagan also edited a nonfiction book on the subject. An updated collection of articles on the same topic was published in 2011.\n\nIn 2016, McGill University Linguistics Professor, Jessica Coon, spoke with Business Insider about how 2016 sci-fi blockbuster, \"Arrival\", properly portrayed how humans might actually communicate with aliens. To create this language, film producers consulted with Wolfram Research Founder and CEO, Stephen Wolfram - creator of the computer programming language known as the Wolfram Language - and his son, Christopher. Together, they helped analyze approximately 100 logograms that ultimately served as the basis for the alien language utilized throughout the film. This work, along with many other thoughts with regard to artificial intelligence communication has been documented in an interview published by Space.com. During production, Wolfram's personal copy of \"Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse\" was also on set.\n\nPublished in 1992 by Carl Devito and Richard Oehrle, \"A language based on the fundamental facts of science\" is a paper describing a language similar in syntax to Astraglossa and Lincos, but which builds its vocabulary around known physical properties.\n\nIn 2010, Michael W. Busch created a general-purpose binary language later used in the Lone Signal project to transmit crowdsourced messages to extraterrestrial intelligence (METI). This was followed by an attempt to extend the syntax used in the Lone Signal hailing message to communicate in a way that, while neither mathematical nor strictly logical, was nonetheless understandable given the prior definition of terms and concepts in the Lone Signal hailing message.\nPictorial communication systems seek to describe fundamental mathematical or physical concepts via simplified diagrams sent as bitmaps. These messages presume that the recipient has similar visual capabilities and can understand basic mathematics and geometry. A common critique of these systems is that they presume a shared understanding of special shapes, which may not be the case with a species with substantially different vision, and therefore a different way of interpreting visual information. For instance, an arrow representing the movement of some object could be interpreted as a weapon firing.\n\nThe two Pioneer plaques were launched on Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 in 1972 and 1973, depicting the location of the Earth in the galaxy and the solar system, and the form of the human body.\n\nLaunched in 1977, the Voyager probes carried two golden records that were inscribed with diagrams depicting the human form, our solar system, and its location. Also included were recordings of images and sounds from Earth.\n\nThe Arecibo message, transmitted in 1974, was a 1679 pixel image with 73 rows and 23 columns. It shows the numbers one through ten, the atomic numbers of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus, the formulas for the sugars and bases in the nucleotides of DNA, the number of nucleotides in DNA, the double helix structure of DNA, a figure of a human being and its height, the population of Earth, a diagram of our solar system, and an image of the Arecibo telescope with its diameter.\n\nThe \"Cosmic Call\" messages consisted of a few digital sections - \"Rosetta Stone\", copy of Arecibo Message, Bilingual Image Glossary, the Braastad message, as well as text, audio, video, and other image files submitted for transmission by everyday people around the world. The \"Rosetta Stone\" was composed by Stephane Dumas and Yvan Dutil and represents a multi-page bitmap that builds a vocabulary of symbols representing numbers and mathematical operations. The message proceeds from basic mathematics to progressively more complex concepts, including physical processes and objects (such as a hydrogen atom). The message is designed with a noise resistant format and characters that make it resistant to alteration by noise. These messages were transmitted in 1999 and 2003 from Evpatoria Planetary Radar under scientific guidance of Alexander L. Zaitsev. Richard Braastad coordinated the overall project.\n\nStar systems to which messages were sent, are the following:\n\nThe \"Teen-Age Message\", composed by Russian scientists (Zaitsev, Gindilis, Pshenichner, Filippova) and teens, was transmitted from the 70-m dish of Evpatoria Deep Space Center to six star systems resembling that of the Sun on August 29 and September 3 and 4, 2001. The message consists of three parts:\n\nSection 1 represents a coherent-sounding radio signal with slow Doppler wavelength tuning to imitate transmission from the Sun's center. This signal was transmitted in order to help extraterrestrials detect the TAM and diagnose the radio propagation effect of the interstellar medium.\n\nSection 2 is analog information representing musical melodies performed on the theremin. This electric musical instrument produces a quasi-monochromatic signal, which is easily detectable across interstellar distances. There were seven musical compositions in the First Theremin Concert for Aliens. The 14-minute analog transmission of the theremin concert would take almost 50 hours by digital means; see The First Musical Interstellar Radio Message.\n\nSection 3 represents a well-known Arecibo-like binary digital information: the logotype of the TAM, bilingual Russian and English greeting to aliens, and image glossary.\n\nStar systems to which the message was sent are the following:\n\nThe Cosmic Call-2 message contained text, images, video, music, the Dutil/Dumas message, a copy of the 1974 Arecibo message, BIG = Bilingual Image Glossary, the AI program \"Ella\", and the Braastad message.\n\nAlgorithmic communication systems are a relatively new field within CETI. In these systems, which build upon early work on mathematical languages, the sender describes a small set of mathematic and logic symbols that form the basis for a rudimentary programming language that the recipient can run on a virtual machine. Algorithmic communication has a number of advantages over static pictorial and mathematical messages, including: localized communication (the recipient can probe and interact with the programs within a message, without transmitting a reply to the sender and then waiting years for a response), forward error correction (the message might contain algorithms that process data elsewhere in the message), and the ability to embed proxy agents within the message. In principle, a sophisticated program when run on a fast enough computing substrate, may exhibit complex behavior and perhaps, intelligence.\n\n\"CosmicOS\", designed by Paul Fitzpatrick at MIT, describes a virtual machine that is derived from lambda calculus.\n\n\"Logic Gate Matrices\" (a.k.a. LGM), developed by Brian McConnell, describes a universal virtual machine that is constructed by connecting coordinates in an n-dimensional space via mathematics and logic operations, for example: (1,0,0) <-- (OR (0,0,1) (0,0,2)). Using this method, one may describe an arbitrarily complex computing substrate as well as the instructions to be executed on it.\n\nThis research focuses on the event that we receive a signal or message that is either not directed at us (eavesdropping) or one that is in its natural communicative form. To tackle this difficult, but probable scenario, methods are being developed that first, will detect if a signal has structure indicative of an intelligent source, categorize the type of structure detected, and then decipher its content: from its physical level encoding and patterns to the parts-of-speech that encode internal and external ontologies.\n\nPrimarily, this structure modeling focuses on the search for generic human and inter-species language universals to devise computational methods by which language may be discriminated from non-language and core structural syntactic elements of unknown languages may be detected. Aims of this research include: contributing to the understanding of language structure and the detection of intelligent language-like features in signals, to aid the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.\n\nThe problem goal is therefore to separate language from non-language without dialogue, and learn something about the structure of language in the passing. The language may not be human (animals, aliens, computers...), the perceptual space may be unknown, and we cannot presume human language structure, but must begin somewhere. We need to approach the language signal from a naive viewpoint, in effect, increasing our ignorance and assuming as little as possible.\n\nIf a sequence can be tokenized, that is, separated into \"words\", an unknown human language may be distinguished from many other data sequences by the frequency distribution of the tokens. Human languages conform to a Zipfian distribution, while many (but not all) other data sequences do not. It has been proposed that an alien language also might conform to such a distribution (). When displayed in a log-log graph of frequency vs. rank, this distribution would appear as a somewhat straight line with a slope of approximately -1. SETI scientist Laurance Doyle explains that the slope of a line that represents individual tokens in a stream of tokens may indicate whether the stream contains linguistic or other structured content. If the line angles at 45°, the stream contains such content. If the line is flat, it does not.\n\n\nSome researchers have concluded that in order to communicate with extraterrestrial species, humanity must first try to communicate with Earth's intelligent animal species. John C. Lilly worked on with interspecies communication by teaching dolphins English (successful with rhythms, not with understandability, given their different mouth/blowhole shapes). He practiced various disciplines of spirituality and also ingested psychedelic drugs such as LSD and (later) ketamine in the company of dolphins. He tried to determine whether he could communicate non-verbally with dolphins, and also tried to determine if some extraterrestrial radio signals are intelligent communications. Similarly, Laurance Doyle, Robert Freitas and Brenda McCowan compare the complexity of cetacean and human languages to help determine whether a specific signal from space is complex enough to represent a message that needs to be decoded.\n\n\n"}

Its (interactive) research reports and podcast are written to 'advocate for changes in consumer and corporate behaviours and policy changes that improve the living and working conditions of garment workers everywhere'.\n\nThe #Haulternative campaign, in conjunction with the \"Daily Telegraph\", features fashion vloggers filming themselves doing an alternative fashion haul. Haulers who participated included CutiePieMarzia Noodlerella, Bip Ling, Grav3yardgirl and Shameless Maya with combined views of 2 million on YouTube.\n\nIn 2014, Fashion Revolution published a quiz and an education pack for school, college and university teachers and students. These were freely available online.\n\nIn 2015, a new quiz and separate education worksheets were produced for primary schools (7–11 years), secondary schools (11–16 years), further education colleges (16–18 years) and universities (18+). These were published in English and translated into Spanish, Finnish and other languages by Country Coordination teams.\n\nTo encourage students to 'Be curious, Find Out, Do something' about #whomademyclothes, these worksheets continue to be developed and now include :\n\nIn July 2015, a collection of social media postings showing how teachers and students got involved the Fashion Revolution was published on Pinterest, along with a 'who made my clothes?' film library, and a collection of 'imaginative ways in which the work of artists, activists and others can be used to inspire and engage people in the Fashion Revolution'. These continue to be updated.\n\nIn August 2016, three sessions were organised at the Annual Conference of the Royal Geographical Society (with Institute of British Geographers) conference in London with academic and activist speakers talking to the theme of \"Scholar activism and the Fashion Revolution: ‘who made my clothes?’\" Session one focused on connecting producers and consumers, session two on slow sustainable fashion in practice and session three on engaging publics.\n\nIn June–July 2017, a free 3 week online course called 'Who Made My Clothes' was created in collaboration with the University of Exeter. Run by and featuring members of Fashion Revolution's Global Coordination Team - Ian Cook, Orsola de Castro, Sarah Ditty and Joss Whipple - it encouraged over 8,000 learners worldwide to Be Curious, Find Out and Do Something about the pay and conditions of people working in the global garment industry. The course will run again in June–July 2018.\n\n"}

{"id": "50981832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50981832", "title": "Generation Snowflake", "text": "Generation Snowflake\n\nGeneration Snowflake, or Snowflake Generation, is a neologistic term used to characterize the young adults of the 2010s as being more prone to taking offense and less resilient than previous generations, or as being too emotionally vulnerable to cope with views that challenge their own. The term is considered derogatory. It is one of several informal examples of usage of the word \"snowflake\" to refer to people.\n\nThe term \"snowflake\" has been used to refer to children raised by their parents in ways that give them an inflated sense of their own uniqueness. This usage of \"snowflake\" has been attributed to Chuck Palahniuk's 1996 novel \"Fight Club\", and its 1999 film adaptation. Both the novel and the film include the line \"You are not special. You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.\" In January 2017, Palahniuk claimed credit for coining \"snowflake\", adding that the young adults of the 2010s exhibit \"a kind of new Victorianism\". An article published by Merriam-Webster stated that Palahniuk was not the first person to use \"snowflake\" metaphorically, saying, \"It's the stuff of self-help books and inspirational posters and elementary school assurances. The imagery before negation is lovely; we are each unique snowflakes, each worth treasuring because each is uniquely beautiful.\"\n\nThe term \"Generation Snowflake\", or its variant \"Snowflake Generation\", probably originated in the United States and came into wider use in the United Kingdom in 2016 following the publication of Claire Fox's book \"I Find That Offensive!\". In it she wrote about a confrontation between Yale University students and faculty Head of College, Nicholas Christakis. The confrontation arose after Christakis's wife, Erika Christakis, a lecturer at the university, had suggested students should \"relax a bit rather than labeling fancy dress Halloween costumes as culturally insensitive\", according to Fox. Fox described the video showing the students' reaction as a \"screaming, almost hysterical mob of students\". Fox said the backlash to the viral video led to the disparaging moniker \"generation snowflake\" for the students.\n\n\"Snowflake generation\" was recognised as one of \"Collins Dictionary\" 2016 words of the year. \"Collins\" defines the term as \"the young adults of the 2010s, viewed as being less resilient and more prone to taking Offense than previous generations\". Similarly, in 2016 the \"Financial Times\" included \"snowflake\" in their annual \"Year in a Word\" list, defining it as \"a derogatory term for someone deemed too emotionally vulnerable to cope with views that challenge their own, particularly in universities and other forums once known for robust debate\" and noting that the insult had been aimed at an entire generation.\n\n\"Generation Snowflake\" and \"snowflake\" have been used in relation to purported generational differences; \"snowflake\" and similar terms have also been used more broadly.\n\nAccording to Claire Fox, members of Generation Snowflake \"are genuinely distressed by ideas that run contrary to their worldview\"; they are more likely than previous generations of students to report that they have mental health problems. Fox and journalist Bryony Gordon described these traits as being coupled with a strong sense of entitlement. According to an article titled \"The 'Snowflake' Generation: Real or Imagined?\" from the John William Pope Center reasons proposed by researchers for the reported increase in mental health problems among university students differ. They vary from increased pressure on students, reduced self-reliance resulting from overuse of mental health services, to university authorities' expectations of student fragility.\n\nFox argues helicopter parents created Generation Snowflake, and argues the emphasis on self-esteem in childhood resulted in adults \"tiptoeing around children's sensitivities\" to avoid \"damaging their wellbeing\". In the UK, Tom Bennett was recruited by the government to address behaviour in schools. He commented Generation Snowflake children at school can be over-protected, leading to problems when they progress to university and are confronted with \"the harsher realities of life\". Bennett argues being sheltered from conflict as children can lead to university students who react with intolerance towards people and things they believe may offend someone or toward people who have differing political opinions, leading to a phenomenon called \"no-platforming\", where speakers on controversial topics are prohibited from speaking on a university campus.\n\nIn 2016 some law lecturers at the University of Oxford began using trigger warnings to alert students to potentially distressing subject matter. This drew criticism from Fox and \"GQ\" writer Eleanor Halls, who related the phenomenon to Generation Snowflake, and questioned how well law students educated with trigger warnings would function as lawyers. The university had not adopted a formal policy on trigger warnings, leaving their use to the discretion of individual lecturers.\n\nThe negative connotations of the term Generation Snowflake have been criticized for having been applied too widely; Bennett also commented: \"It's true that, for some of these children, losing fast wi-fi is a crisis and being offended on the internet is a disaster... But then I remember the other ones, and I reckon they all balance each other out.\" Richard Brooks wrote in \"The Daily Telegraph\" that \"students have always been instrumental in turning the tide of public opinion\", and Mark Kingwell, philosophy professor at University of Toronto has objected to the use of the term to characterize political protesting as \"whining\", in response to protests by Millennials following Donald Trump's election as president of the United States.\n\nHistorian Neil Howe, who has written multiple books on generations, describes the term \"Generation Snowflake\" as part of a wider societal pattern of criticizing Millennials. Howe says this includes the 2013 article from \"Time\" titled \"Millennials: The Me Me Me Generation\" and \"The Millennials\" skit from \"Saturday Night Live\" which was shown in 2015. In a three part series written for \"Forbes\" titled \"Generation Snowflake: Really?\", Howe, who is known for Strauss-Howe generational theory, disagrees with the negative characterizations of the term \"generation snowflake\", but he says it is based on \"kernels of truth\". Howe says \"snowflake conjures up specialness and risk aversion\" and he asserts \"Millennials manifest a good deal of both.\" Howe attributes this to being raised during a time of moral panic over children, when protecting children was an increased societal priority. He says this cohort grew up with a \"family fan club protecting and supporting them\" resulting in high self-esteem. Howe says the term generation snowflake implies having high self-esteem is a negative quality, while he argues it is a positive quality associated with a reduction in youth violence and reduced young adult violent crime rate, as well as the reduction in CDC monitored youth risk behaviors such as: not wearing a bicycle helmet, not wearing a seatbelt, having sex, drinking alcohol, and smoking cigarettes. Howe says risk aversion extends to older Millennials as well, citing a reduction in gambling, reduction in investing in the stock market, and reduced attendance at bars/nightclubs. Instead of being a negative as portrayed by term \"generation snowflake\" Howe argues \"one of the many benefits of having a high self-esteem is more prudent behavior\".\n\nHowe notes that \"generation snowflake\" is also used to criticize young adults for living with their parents at higher rates than older generations. Howe attributes this partially to the Great Recession, but says \"that's clearly not the whole story, because the share of Millennials living with their parents is still rising eight years later\". He attributes this to young adults being closer to their parents than previous generations saying \"Millennials are emotionally much closer to their Boomer parents than those Boomers ever were to their own parents.\" Regarding the criticism associated with the term \"generation snowflake\" Howe says \"Every generation is shaped differently by history. Every rising generation brings with it new and different priorities. And every older generation feels threatened when they sense these new priorities could push their world in an unfamiliar direction.\"\n\nIn her syndicated column, Michelle Malkin criticized the provision of the Affordable Care Act which requires employer-based health coverage to extend to adult children up to 26 years of age, describing it as the \"slacker mandate\" and calling these young adults \"precious snowflakes\". Malkin argues the provision has \"cultural consequences\" in that it \"reduces the incentives for 20-somethings to grow up and seek independent lives and livelihoods\".\n\nJessica Roy, writing for the \"Los Angeles Times\", says the alt-right in the United States describes those protesting against Donald Trump as \"snowflakes\", using the term as a pejorative.\n\n"}

{"id": "6021188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6021188", "title": "History of the concept of creativity", "text": "History of the concept of creativity\n\nThe ways in which societies have perceived the concept of creativity have changed throughout history, as has the term itself. The ancient Greek concept of art (in Greek, \"techne\" — the root of \"technique\" and \"technology\"), with the exception of poetry, involved not freedom of action but subjection to \"rules\". In Rome, the Greek concept was partly shaken, and visual artists were viewed as sharing, with poets, imagination and inspiration.\n\nUnder medieval Christianity, the Latin \"\"creatio\" came to designate God's act of \"creatio ex nihilo\"\" (\"creation from nothing\"); thus \"creatio\" ceased to apply to human activities. The Middle Ages, however, went even further than antiquity, when they revoked poetry's exceptional status: it, too, was an art and therefore craft and not creativity.\n\nRenaissance men sought to give voice to their sense of their freedom and creativity. The first to apply the word \"creativity,\" however, was the 17th-century Polish poet Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski — but he applied it only to poetry. For over a century and a half, the idea of \"human\" creativity met with resistance, because the term \"creation\" was reserved for creation \"from nothing.\"\n\nIn the 19th century, art took its revenge: now not only was art recognized as creativity, but \"it alone\" was. When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the sciences and in nature, this was taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts that were proper to art.\n\nThe ancient Greeks had no terms corresponding to \"to create\" or \"creator.\" The expression \"poiein\" (\"to make\") sufficed. And even that was not extended to art in general, but only to \"poiesis\" (poetry) and to the \"poietes\" (poet, or \"maker\") who \"made\" it. Plato asks in \"The Republic\", \"Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?\" and answers, \"Certainly not, he merely imitates.\" To the ancient Greeks, the concept of a creator and of creativity implied freedom of action, whereas the Greeks' concept of art involved subjection to laws and rules. Art (in Greek, \"techne\") was \"the making of things, according to rules.\" It contained no creativity, and it would have been — in the Greeks' view — a bad state of affairs if it \"had\".\n\nThis understanding of art had a distinct premise: Nature is perfect and is subject to laws, therefore man ought to discover its laws and submit to them, and not seek freedom, which will deflect him from that \"optimum\" which he can attain. The artist was a discoverer, not an inventor.\n\nThe sole exception to this Greek view — a \"great\" exception — was poetry. The poet made new things — brought to life a new world — while the artist merely \"imitated\". And the poet, unlike the artist, was \"not\" bound by laws. There were no terms corresponding to \"creativity\" or \"creator,\" but in reality the poet was understood to be one who creates. And only he was so understood. In music, there was no freedom: melodies were prescribed, particularly for ceremonies and entertainments, and were known tellingly as \"nomoi\" (\"laws\"). In the visual arts, freedom was limited by the proportions that Polyclitus had established for the human frame, and which he called \"the canon\" (meaning, \"measure\"). Plato argued in \"Timaeus\" that, to execute a good work, one must contemplate an eternal model. Later the Roman, Cicero, would write that art embraces those things \"of which we have knowledge\" (\"quae sciuntur\").\n\nPoets saw things differently. Book I of the \"Odyssey\" asks, \"Why forbid the singer to please us with singing \"as he himself will?\"\" Aristotle had doubts as to whether poetry was imitation of reality, and as to whether it required adherence to truth: it was, rather, the realm of that \"which is neither true nor false.\"\n\nIn Rome, these Greek concepts were partly shaken. Horace wrote that not only poets but painters as well were entitled to the privilege of daring whatever they wished to (\"quod libet audendi\"). In the declining period of antiquity, Philostratus wrote that \"one can discover a similarity between poetry and art and find that they have imagination in common.\" Callistratos averred that \"Not only is the art of the poets and prosaists inspired, but likewise the hands of sculptors are gifted with the blessing of divine inspiration.\" This was something new: classical Greeks had not applied the concepts of imagination and inspiration to the visual arts but had restricted them to poetry. Latin was richer than Greek: it had a term for \"creating\" (\"\"creatio\") and for \"creator\",\" and had \"two\" expressions — \"\"facere\" and \"creare\" — where Greek had but one, \"poiein\".\" Still, the two Latin terms meant much the same thing.\n\nA fundamental change, however, came in the Christian period: \"creatio\" came to designate God's act of \"creation from nothing\" (\"\"creatio ex nihilo\"). \"Creatio\" thus took on a different meaning than \"facere\"\" (\"to make\"), and ceased to apply to human functions. As the 6th-century Roman official and literary figure Cassiodorus wrote, \"things made and created differ, for we can make, who cannot create.\"\n\nAlongside this new, religious interpretation of the expression, there persisted the ancient view that art is not a domain of creativity. This is seen in two early and influential Christian writers, Pseudo-Dionysius and St. Augustine. Later medieval men such as Hraban the Moor, and Robert Grosseteste in the 13th century, thought much the same way. The Middle Ages here went even further than antiquity; they made no exception of poetry: it too had its rules, was an art, and was therefore craft and not creativity.\n\nAll this changed in modern times. Renaissance men had a sense of their own independence, freedom and creativity, and sought to give voice to this sense of independence and creativity. The philosopher Marsilio Ficino wrote that the artist \"thinks up\" (\"excogitatio\") his works; the theoretician of architecture and painting, Leon Battista Alberti, that he \"preordains\" (\"preordinazione\"); Raphael, that he shapes a painting according to his idea; Leonardo da Vinci, that he employs \"shapes that do not exist in nature\"; Michelangelo, that the artist realizes his vision rather than imitating nature; Giorgio Vasari, that \"nature is conquered by art\"; the Venetian art theoretician, Paolo Pino, that painting is \"inventing what is not\"; Paolo Veronese, that painters avail themselves of the same liberties as do poets and madmen; Federico Zuccari (1542–1609), that the artist shapes \"a new world, new paradises\"; Cesare Cesariano (1483–1541), that architects are \"demi-gods.\" Among musicians, the Flemish composer and musicologist Johannes Tinctoris (1446–1511) demanded novelty in what a composer did, and defined a composer as \"one who produces \"new\" songs.\"\n\nStill more emphatic were those who wrote about poetry: G.P. Capriano held (1555) that the poet's invention springs \"from nothing.\" Francesco Patrizi (1586) saw poetry as \"fiction,\" \"shaping,\" \"transformation.\"\n\nFinally, at long last, someone ventured to use the word, \"creation.\" He was the 17th-century Polish poet and theoretician of poetry, Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski (1595–1640), known as \"the last Latin poet.\" In his treatise, \"De perfecta poesi\", he not only wrote that a poet \"invents,\" \"after a fashion builds,\" but also that the poet \"\"creates anew\" (\"de novo creat\"\"). Sarbiewski even added: \"in the manner of God\" (\"instar Dei\").\n\nSarbiewski, however, regarded creativity as the exclusive privilege of poetry; creativity was not open to visual artists. \"Other arts merely imitate and copy but do not create, because they assume the existence of the material from which they create or of the subject.\" As late as the end of the 17th century, André Félibien (1619–75) would write that the painter is \"so to speak [a] creator.\" The Spanish Jesuit Baltasar Gracián (1601–58) wrote similarly as Sarbiewski: \"Art is the completion of nature, as it were \"a second Creator\"...\"\n\nBy the 18th century, the concept of creativity was appearing more often in art theory. It was linked with the concept of imagination, which was on all lips. Joseph Addison wrote that the imagination \"has something in it like creation.\" Voltaire declared (1740) that \"the true poet is creative.\" With both these authors, however, this was rather only a \"comparison\" of poet with creator.\n\nOther writers took a different view. Denis Diderot felt that imagination is merely \"the memory of forms and contents,\" and \"creates nothing\" but only combines, magnifies or diminishes. It was precisely in 18th-century France, indeed, that the idea of man's creativity met with resistance. Charles Batteux wrote that \"The human mind \"cannot create\", strictly speaking; all its products bear the stigmata of their model; even monsters invented by an imagination unhampered by laws can only be composed of parts taken from nature.\" Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues (1715–47), and Étienne Bonnot de Condillac (1715–80) spoke to a similar effect.\n\nTheir resistance to the idea of human creativity had a triple source. The expression, \"creation,\" was then reserved for creation \"ex nihilo\" (), which was inaccessible to man. Second, creation is a mysterious act, and Enlightenment psychology did not admit of mysteries. Third, artists of the age were attached to their rules, and creativity seemed irreconcilable with rules. The latter objection was the weakest, as it was already beginning to be realized (e.g., by Houdar de la Motte, 1715) that rules ultimately are a \"human invention\".\n\nIn the 19th century, art took its compensation for the resistance of preceding centuries against recognizing it as creativity. Now not only was art regarded as creativity, but \"it alone\" was so regarded. When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the sciences (e.g., Jan Łukasiewicz, 1878–1956) and in nature (e.g., Henri Bergson), this was generally taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts proper to art.\n\nThe start of the \"scientific\" study of creativity is sometimes taken as J. P. Guilford's 1950 address to the American Psychological Association, which helped popularize the subject.\n\nOther students of creativity have taken a more pragmatic approach, teaching practical creativity techniques.

{"id": "1284911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1284911", "title": "James Bond music", "text": "James Bond music\n\nThe \"James Bond\" film series from Eon Productions features numerous musical compositions since its inception in 1962, many of which are now considered classic pieces of British film music. The best known of these pieces is the ubiquitous \"James Bond Theme\". Other instrumentals, such as the \"007 Theme\" or \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", and various songs, such as Shirley Bassey's \"Goldfinger\", Paul McCartney's \"Live and Let Die\", Carly Simon's \"Nobody Does It Better\", Sheena Easton's \"For Your Eyes Only\" and Duran Duran's \"A View to a Kill\" have also become identified with the series. Two Bond songs have won the Academy Award for Best Original Song: \"Skyfall\" by Adele and \"Writing's on the Wall\" by Sam Smith.\n\nThe briefest of \"James Bond themes\", this composition started off the \"Opening Titles\" music of \"From Russia with Love\". It was heard in the \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" film trailer. WLS (AM) used the theme in the mid-1960s for their secret agent radio serial \"The Wild Adventures of Peter Fugitive\" that appeared on \"The Art Roberts Show\".\n\n\"007 Theme\", not to be confused with the \"James Bond Theme\", is an adventure theme composed by John Barry in 1963 for the Bond film, \"From Russia with Love\".\n\"The John Barry Seven\" had pop chart hit with a cover version of Elmer Bernstein's theme to \"The Magnificent Seven\" that featured seven beats repeated throughout the theme. Barry used seven beats throughout the \"007 Theme\".\n\nIt became a secondary theme for the Bond films, being used throughout the series, primarily during action scenes. Here are its most notable appearances:\n\nThe theme has not been featured in its entirety in a Bond film since its use in \"Moonraker\".\n\nThis piece of music was also used by Al Primo, the news director at KYW-TV in Philadelphia for its long-time theme to \"Eyewitness News\", and was adopted by other Group W stations in Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Boston and San Francisco as well as other non-Group W stations, including WLS-TV in Chicago. The theme was also sampled by Big Audio Dynamite for the 1986 song \"Sightsee M.C!\"\n\nLike John Barry, David Arnold has left his own mark in the music of James Bond. In this case, he has established what can be called the \"suspense motif\", which is a descending, often repetitive four-note motif that can be heard in all of the Bond films he has scored. This motif can be heard in:\n\nThe largest contributions to the Bond films, save for the \"James Bond Theme\", are works from John Barry. In addition to his uncredited contribution to \"Dr. No\", Barry composed eleven Bond soundtracks and is credited with the creation of \"007\" (dominated by brass and percussion) and the popular orchestral theme from \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\".\n\nNext to Barry, David Arnold is the series' most regular composer. He composed the scores for five Bond films: \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" through \"Quantum of Solace\". His Barry-esque orchestrations combined with electronic rhythm elements gave the Pierce Brosnan era its musical identity. Arnold was essentially Barry's anointed successor, Barry having recommended Arnold to Barbara Broccoli when she took over the Bond films from her father Albert R. Broccoli.\n\nOther major composers and record-producers include George Martin, Bill Conti, Michael Kamen, Marvin Hamlisch, Éric Serra and Thomas Newman. Each of these composed for only one Bond film, with the exception of Newman. The departures from John Barry had various causes. Sometimes Barry declined in order to avoid paying double income tax—US and UK. Sometimes the director had worked with the composer of his choice on other films—the latter happened to David Arnold with \"Skyfall\" and \"Spectre\".\n\nThe \"James Bond Theme\" is the main theme for \"Dr. No\", and has featured in all the Eon Productions Bond films in different versions. The theme has also featured on the gun barrel sequences at the beginning of the films. The original theme was written by Monty Norman, and was performed by John Barry and his orchestra in 1962. In the opening credits of \"Dr. No\", two other pieces were played: an untitled bongo interlude and a Calypso-flavored rendition of \"Three Blind Mice\", titled \"Kingston Calypso\". Due to this, \"Dr. No\" is the only film to have more than one opening theme. The \"James Bond Theme\" reached 13 in the UK Singles Chart, and remained in the charts for 13 weeks.\n\nThe opening credits of \"From Russia with Love\" were accompanied by an instrumental version of the main theme, arranged by John Barry and written by Lionel Bart. A single by The John Barry Orchestra reached 39 in the U.K. At the film's end, a vocal version by English singer Matt Monro is heard. This song spent 13 weeks in the U.K. charts, peaking at 20.\n\n\"Goldfinger\" was the third soundtrack composed by John Barry, and this time the theme song had lyrics written by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. The soundtrack reached 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and spent 70 weeks on the charts. It also peaked at 14 on the UK Albums Chart, and received the Bond series first Grammy Award nomination, Best Original Score from a Motion Picture or Television Show.\n\nWelsh singer Shirley Bassey has performed the most Bond themes – she recorded the themes to \"Goldfinger\", \"Diamonds Are Forever\", and \"Moonraker\". Bassey also recorded her own versions of \"Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" for \"Thunderball\" and it was rumoured that \"No Good About Goodbye\" was intended for \"Quantum of Solace\", however David Arnold said 'No Good About Goodbye' was never intended as a Bond song.\n\nPaul McCartney's performance of \"Live and Let Die\" was the first Bond theme song to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song; it reached 2 as a U.S. single, and 9 on the U.K. charts. George Martin's work in the song won the Grammy for Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalists. Marvin Hamlisch's (music) and Carole Bayer Sager's (lyrics) \"Nobody Does It Better\" (performed by Carly Simon) received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, as did Bill Conti's \"For Your Eyes Only\", which was performed by Sheena Easton. It was not until the 2013 Oscars that a Bond theme song finally won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the theme song from \"Skyfall\" by Adele. Thomas Newman's score also got the first nomination for Academy Award for Best Original Score in the series since Hamlisch's own for \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", while winning the Grammy for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. Adele's song also won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media. Sam Smith's \"Writing's on the Wall\" from \"Spectre\" would also win the Oscar for Best Original Song.\n\nDuran Duran and John Barry's \"A View To A Kill\" topped the singles charts in the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100, the only Bond theme to hit 1 in the United States. No James Bond theme had topped the charts in the UK until Sam Smith's \"Writing's on the Wall\" entered the charts at number one on 2 October 2015.\n\nSeveral of the later films have alternative theme songs, often during the closing credits. \"The Living Daylights\" featured The Pretenders performing \"If There Was a Man,\" composed by John Barry with Chrissie Hynde. \"Licence to Kill\" has \"If You Asked Me To\" sung by Patti Labelle. \"GoldenEye\" featured Éric Serra's \"The Experience of Love\". \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" included k.d. lang's \"Surrender\" during the closing credits, a song which was originally proposed by composer David Arnold to be the title sequence theme instead of the Sheryl Crow title song. The \"Surrender\" theme is heard throughout the score while the melody of Sheryl Crow's song is not used again during the film. This hearkens back to the \"Thunderball\" soundtrack, where \"Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" was originally proposed as the opening credits music, only to be replaced by the eponymous title track as sung by Tom Jones.\n\n\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" featured an instrumental theme tune, something which remains unique amongst the post-\"From Russia with Love\" films, and included a vocal theme in the form of Louis Armstrong's performance of \"We Have All the Time in the World\", written by John Barry and Hal David.\n\nA number of Bond films include one (or more) additional songs in the soundtrack. Some of these pieces of music, such as \"We Have All the Time in the World\" by Louis Armstrong, have gone on to become as well known as the main themes, while other songs remain exclusively linked to the film in which they appear.\n\nSome songs have been dubbed for the foreign versions of the films.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of songs were written as potential Bond themes but went unused. These include:\n\nBond music has inspired a number of cover albums in a variety of genres, including the 2007 album \"Mister Bond – A Jazzy Cocktail of Ice Cold Themes\" (lounge), \"\" featuring David Arnold collaborating with several contemporary artists. The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra recorded several albums with Bond music and performs in premieres and special events of Bond films. Britain's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra released an album of several Bond songs performances called \"Best Of James Bond\", some of which were used on the \"Ultimate Edition\" DVD releases menus. Billy Strange released \"Secret Agent File\" in 1965. Death metal cover band Ten Masked Men has included at least one Bond theme on each of their albums. In 2004, The Cavaliers play a show titled \"007\" using Bond music, such as \"GoldenEye\", \"For Your Eyes Only\", \"Live and Let Die\", \"Hovercraft Chase\", \"Welcome to Cuba\" and \"Paris and Bond\". Some of them are Italo disco-like rhythms and soundtrack albums promote hits that matches the film's theme. In 2000 'An Electronika Tribute to James Bond' album was released adding yet another genre to the Bond fandom.\n\nWith the increase in audio quality for video game consoles and personal computers, in addition to the continued popularity of computer and video games, publisher Electronic Arts as well as Activision (since 2008) has included opening themes and film-style credit sequences to some of its more recent Bond video game spin offs.\n\nThe 2008 continuation novel \"Devil May Care\" by Sebastian Faulks was the first James Bond novel to receive its own theme song. Also called \"Devil May Care\", the song was written and recorded by Cardiff band SAL and was available on the UK audiobook release of the novel.\n\n\n"}

The Mojo Triangle has presented the world with an astonishing array of creative artists, not just in music, but also in literature and films.\n\nThe phrase \"Mojo Triangle\" was first coined by author James L. Dickerson in his award-winning 2005 book, Mojo Triangle: Birthplace of Country, Blues, Jazz and Rock 'n' Roll.\nA fiddle tune named \"Natchez Under the Hill,\" which originated in the joints along the docks in Natchez, was one of the first original songs ever published in America, according to Dickerson. Published in 1834, it was re-titled \"Old Zip Coon,\" only to later morph into \"Turkey in the Straw.\" With that song began a tradition that inspired the creation of a musical dynasty.\n\nNatchez remained a musical cauldron throughout the 1800s, blending traditional folk music from Europe with the exotic rhythms and harmonies of the Choctaw and Chickasaw, and the unique phrasing vocalized by slaves from Africa. But it was not until the late 1920s, when Jimmie Rodgers began recording what would later be recognized as America's first country music that the first blend of European/Native American/African music took hold.\n\nTen years later, Robert Johnson took the music recorded by Rodgers and moved it a step further by recording what we today call blues music. Both Rodgers and Johnson owe an enormous debt to the Choctaw. \"Both use 6/4, 5/4, and 4/4 time signatures, and both use short 6/4 introductions that quickly change to 5/4 or 4/4 after one or two bars. For example Johnson's 'Little Queen of Spades' has a one bar introduction in 6/4 that changes to 4/4, an identical time signature to the Choctaw's 'Wedding Dance,' which also goes 6/4 to 4/4.\"\n\nMusicians in New Orleans incorporated the music of Natchez and added Caribbean influences to produce jazz, a free-flowing instrumental interpretation of the same influences that birthed blues and country.\nIn the mid-1950s, Elvis Presley, Scotty Moore and Bill Black took the work of Rodgers and Johnson and gave shape to rock 'n' roll, creating an unbroken circle of creativity that continues to this day.\n\nMUSIC\n\nDeborah Allen, Mose Allison, Lisa Angelle, Lil Hardin Armstrong (1898–1971), Louis Armstrong (1901–1971), Estelle Axton (1918–2004), Booker T. & the M.G.'s (Booker T.

Two other books, Goin' Back to Memphis and That's Alright, Elvis, were finalists for the Gleason Award, given out annually by Rolling Stone magazine, BMI, and New York University. In the mid-to-late 1980s, Dickerson was the publisher/editor of Nine-O-One Network Magazine, the first magazine located in the Mojo Triangle to obtain newsstand circulation in all 50 states. He co-owned and produced a radio syndication, Pulsebeat—Voice of the Heartland, which focused on the music produced in the Mojo Triangle.\n\nOther music historians who have written about musicians from the Mojo Triangle are Stanley Booth (The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones, Rhythm Oil, and Furry's Blues); Peter Guralnick (Sweet Soul Music) and Robert Palmer (). None of those writers were born in the Triangle, but all wrote extensively on the blues. Palmer, who died in 1997, was a music writer for the New York Times and spent the last years of his life living in the Mojo Triangle. Booth, who lives in Georgia, has contributed to Rolling Stone, Playboy, and Esquire. Guralnick is probably best known for his two-volume biography of Elvis Presley.\n\nGraceland \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20110417031419/http://www.elvis.com/Graceland/\n\nNatchez Festival of Music (March) \nhttp://natchezfestivalofmusic.art.officelive.com/default.aspx\n\nMemphis in May (May) \nhttp://www.memphisinmay.org/\n\nTupelo Elvis Festival (June)http://tupeloelvisfestival.com/\n\nW.

{"id": "61309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61309", "title": "Mosaic", "text": "Mosaic\n\nA mosaic is a piece of art or image made from the assembling of small pieces of colored glass, stone, or other materials. It is often used in decorative art or as interior decoration. Most mosaics are made of small, flat, roughly square, pieces of stone or glass of different colors, known as \"tesserae\". Some, especially floor mosaics, are made of small rounded pieces of stone, and called \"pebble mosaics\".\n\nMosaics have a long history, starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC. Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times, both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries; that tradition was adopted by the Norman Kingdom of Sicily in the 12th century, by the eastern-influenced Republic of Venice, and among the Rus in Ukraine. Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance, though artists like Raphael continued to practise the old technique. Roman and Byzantine influence led Jewish artists to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the Middle East with floor mosaics.\n\nMosaic was widely used on religious buildings and palaces in early Islamic art, including Islam's first great religious building, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, and the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Mosaic went out of fashion in the Islamic world after the 8th century.\n\nModern mosaics are made by professional artists, street artists, and as a popular craft. Many materials other than traditional stone and ceramic tesserae may be employed, including shells, glass and beads.\nThe earliest known examples of mosaics made of different materials were found at a temple building in Abra, Mesopotamia, and are dated to the second half of 3rd millennium BC. They consist of pieces of colored stones, shells and ivory. Excavations at Susa and Chogha Zanbil show evidence of the first glazed tiles, dating from around 1500 BC. However, mosaic patterns were not used until the times of Sassanid Empire and Roman influence.\n\nBronze age pebble mosaics have been found at Tiryns; mosaics of the 4th century BC are found in the Macedonian palace-city of Aegae, and the 4th-century BC mosaic of The Beauty of Durrës discovered in Durrës, Albania in 1916, is an early figural example; the Greek figural style was mostly formed in the 3rd century BC. Mythological subjects, or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy, were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design, with strongly emphasized borders.\nPliny the Elder mentions the artist Sosus of Pergamon by name, describing his mosaics of the food left on a floor after a feast and of a group of doves drinking from a bowl.\nBoth of these themes were widely copied.\n\nGreek figural mosaics could have been copied or adapted paintings, a far more prestigious artform, and the style was enthusiastically adopted by the Romans so that large floor mosaics enriched the floors of Hellenistic villas and Roman dwellings from Britain to Dura-Europos. Most recorded names of Roman mosaic workers are Greek, suggesting they dominated high quality work across the empire; no doubt most ordinary craftsmen were slaves. Splendid mosaic floors are found in Roman villas across North Africa, in places such as Carthage, and can still be seen in the extensive collection in Bardo Museum in Tunis, Tunisia.\n\nThere were two main techniques in Greco-Roman mosaic: \"opus vermiculatum\" used tiny \"tesserae\", typically cubes of 4 millimeters or less, and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support. The tiny \"tesserae\" allowed very fine detail, and an approach to the illusionism of painting. Often small panels called \"emblemata\" were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work. The normal technique was \"opus tessellatum\", using larger tesserae, which was laid on site. There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background, which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work.\n\nIn Rome, Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover some surfaces of walls and ceilings in the \"Domus Aurea\", built 64 AD, and wall mosaics are also found at Pompeii and neighbouring sites. However it seems that it was not until the Christian era that figural wall mosaics became a major form of artistic expression. The Roman church of Santa Costanza, which served as a mausoleum for one or more of the Imperial family, has both religious mosaic and decorative secular ceiling mosaics on a round vault, which probably represent the style of contemporary palace decoration.\n\nThe mosaics of the Villa Romana del Casale near Piazza Armerina in Sicily are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics \"in situ\" in the world, and are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The large \"villa rustica\", which was probably owned by Emperor Maximian, was built largely in the early 4th century. The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century. The most important pieces are the \"Circus Scene\", the 64m long \"Great Hunting Scene\", the \"Little Hunt\", the \"Labours of Hercules\" and the famous \"Bikini Girls\", showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century bikinis. The peristyle, the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics. Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in Palermo where two houses were discovered. The most important scenes there depicted are an Orpheus mosaic, \"Alexander the Great's Hunt\" and the \"Four Seasons\".\n\nIn 1913 the Zliten mosaic, a Roman mosaic famous for its many scenes from gladiatorial contests, hunting and everyday life, was discovered in the Libyan town of Zliten. In 2000 archaeologists working in Leptis Magna, Libya, uncovered a 30 ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century AD. The mosaics show a warrior in combat with a deer, four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground, and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue, staring at his slain opponent. The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a bath house within a Roman villa. The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of mosaic art ever seen — a \"masterpiece comparable in quality with the Alexander Mosaic in Pompeii.\"\n\nA specific genre of Roman mosaic was called \"asaroton\" (Greek for \"unswept floor\"). It depicted in trompe l'oeil style the feast leftovers on the floors of wealthy houses.\n\nWith the building of Christian basilicas in the late 4th century, wall and ceiling mosaics were adopted for Christian uses. The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived, but the mosaics of Santa Constanza and Santa Pudenziana, both from the 4th century, still exist. The winemaking putti in the ambulatory of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of Bacchus, which symbolizes transformation or change, and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum, the original function of this building. In another great Constantinian basilica, the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved. The so-called Tomb of the Julii, near the crypt beneath St Peter's Basilica, is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations. The Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki, converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century, was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics. Only fragments survive of the original decoration, especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer, in front of complex architectural fantasies.\n\nIn the following century Ravenna, the capital of the Western Roman Empire, became the center of late Roman mosaic art (see details in Ravenna section). Milan also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century. In the St Aquilinus Chapel of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of Elijah; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors, naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion. The surviving apse mosaic of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century, although it was restored many times later. The baptistery of the basilica, which was demolished in the 15th century, had a vault covered with gold-leaf tesserae, large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated. In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro, now a chapel of Sant'Ambrogio, every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century. Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome, while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background. The low spandrels give space for the symbols of the four Evangelists.\n\nAlbingaunum was the main Roman port of Liguria. The octagonal baptistery of the town was decorated in the 5th century with high quality blue and white mosaics representing the Apostles. The surviving remains are somewhat fragmented. Massilia remained a thriving port and a Christian spiritual center in Southern Gaul where favourable societal and economic conditions ensured the survival of mosaic art in the 5th and 6th centuries. The large baptistery, once the grandest building of its kind in Western Europe, had a geometric floor mosaic which is only known from 19th century descriptions. Other parts of the episcopal complex were also decorated with mosaics as new finds, that were unearthed in the 2000s, attest. The funerary basilica of Saint Victor, built in a quarry outside the walls, was decorated with mosaics but only a small fragment with blue and green scrolls survived on the intrados of an arch (the basilica was later buried under a medieval abbey).\n\nA mosaic pavement depicting humans, animals and plants from the original 4th-century cathedral of Aquileia has survived in the later medieval church. This mosaic adopts pagan motifs such as the Nilotic scene, but behind the traditional naturalistic content is Christian symbolism such as the ichthys. The 6th-century early Christian basilicas of Sant' Eufemia and Santa Maria delle Grazie in Grado also have mosaic floors.\n\nIn the 5th-century Ravenna, the capital of the Western Roman Empire, became the center of late Roman mosaic art. The Mausoleum of Galla Placidia was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430. The vaults of the small, cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background. The central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky. Another great building established by Galla Placidia was the church of San Giovanni Evangelista. She erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from Constantinople to Ravenna. The mosaics depicted the storm, portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of Ravenna, Peter Chrysologus. They are known only from Renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747.\n\nOstrogoths kept alive the tradition in the 6th century, as the mosaics of the Arian Baptistry, Baptistry of Neon, Archbishop's Chapel, and the earlier phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo testify.\n\nAfter 539 Ravenna was reconquered by the Romans in the form of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) and became the seat of the Exarchate of Ravenna. The greatest development of Christian mosaics unfolded in the second half of the 6th century. Outstanding examples of Byzantine mosaic art are the later phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo. The mosaic depicting Emperor Saint Justinian I and Empress Theodora in the Basilica of San Vitale were executed shortly after the Byzantine conquest. The mosaics of the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe were made around 549. The anti-Arian theme is obvious in the apse mosaic of San Michele in Affricisco, executed in 545–547 (largely destroyed; the remains in Berlin).\n\nThe last example of Byzantine mosaics in Ravenna was commissioned by bishop Reparatus between 673–79 in the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe. The mosaic panel in the apse showing the bishop with Emperor Constantine IV is obviously an imitation of the Justinian panel in San Vitale.\n\nThe mosaic pavement of the Vrina Plain basilica of Butrint, Albania appear to pre-date that of the Baptistery by almost a generation, dating to the last quarter of the 5th or the first years of the 6th century. The mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures, birds, terrestrial beasts, fruits, flowers, trees and abstracts – designed to depict a terrestrial paradise of God’s creation. Superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets, tabulae ansatae, carrying inscriptions. A variety of fish, a crab, a lobster, shrimps, mushrooms, flowers, a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions, which reads: In fulfilment of the vow (prayer) of those whose names God knows. This anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors’ humility and an acknowledgement of God’s omniscience.\n\nThe abundant variety of natural life depicted in the Butrint mosaics celebrates the richness of God’s creation; some elements also have specific connotations. The kantharos vase and vine refer to the eucharist, the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ leading to salvation. Peacocks are symbols of paradise and resurrection; shown eating or drinking from the vase they indicate the route to eternal life. Deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to Christ: \"As a heart desireth the water brook, so my souls longs for thee, O God.\" Water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the Church who are christened.\n\nChristian mosaic art also flourished in Rome, gradually declining as conditions became more difficult in the Early Middle Ages. 5th century mosaics can be found over the triumphal arch and in the nave of the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. The 27 surviving panels of the nave are the most important mosaic cycle in Rome of this period. Two other important 5th century mosaics are lost but we know them from 17th-century drawings. In the apse mosaic of Sant'Agata dei Goti (462–472, destroyed in 1589) Christ was seated on a globe with the twelve Apostles flanking him, six on either side. At Sant'Andrea in Catabarbara (468–483, destroyed in 1686) Christ appeared in the center, flanked on either side by three Apostles. Four streams flowed from the little mountain supporting Christ. The original 5th-century apse mosaic of the Santa Sabina was replaced by a very similar fresco by Taddeo Zuccari in 1559. The composition probably remained unchanged: Christ flanked by male and female saints, seated on a hill while lambs drinking from a stream at its feet. All three mosaics had a similar iconography.\n\n6th-century pieces are rare in Rome but the mosaics inside the triumphal arch of the basilica of San Lorenzo fuori le mura belong to this era. The \"Chapel of Ss. Primo e Feliciano\" in Santo Stefano Rotondo has very interesting and rare mosaics from the 7th century. This chapel was built by Pope Theodore I as a family burial place.\n\nIn the 7th–9th centuries Rome fell under the influence of Byzantine art, noticeable on the mosaics of Santa Prassede, Santa Maria in Domnica, Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura, Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, Santi Nereo e Achilleo and the San Venanzio chapel of San Giovanni in Laterano. The great dining hall of Pope Leo III in the Lateran Palace was also decorated with mosaics. They were all destroyed later except for one example, the so-called Triclinio Leoniano of which a copy was made in the 18th century. Another great work of Pope Leo, the apse mosaic of Santa Susanna, depicted Christ with the Pope and Charlemagne on one side, and SS. Susanna and Felicity on the other. It was plastered over during a renovation in 1585. Pope Paschal I (817–824) embellished the church of Santo Stefano del Cacco with an apsidal mosaic which depicted the pope with a model of the church (destroyed in 1607).\n\nThe fragment of an 8th-century mosaic, the Epiphany is one of the very rare remaining pieces of the medieval decoration of Old St. Peter's Basilica, demolished in the late 16th century. The precious fragment is kept in the sacristy of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. It proves the high artistic quality of the destroyed St. Peter's mosaics.\n\nMosaics were more central to Byzantine culture than to that of Western Europe. Byzantine church interiors were generally covered with golden mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries. The majority of Byzantine mosaics were destroyed without trace during wars and conquests, but the surviving remains still form a fine collection.\n\nThe great buildings of Emperor Justinian like the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the Nea Church in Jerusalem and the rebuilt Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem were certainly embellished with mosaics but none of these survived.\n\nImportant fragments survived from the mosaic floor of the Great Palace of Constantinople which was commissioned during Justinian's reign. The figures, animals, plants all are entirely classical but they are scattered before a plain background. The portrait of a moustached man, probably a Gothic chieftain, is considered the most important surviving mosaic of the Justinianian age. The so-called \"small sekreton\" of the palace was built during Justin II's reign around 565–577. Some fragments survive from the mosaics of this vaulted room. The vine scroll motifs are very similar to those in the Santa Constanza and they still closely follow the Classical tradition. There are remains of floral decoration in the Church of the Acheiropoietos in Thessaloniki (5th–6th centuries).\nIn the 6th century, Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine Italy, became the center of mosaic making. Istria also boasts some important examples from this era. The Euphrasian Basilica in Parentium was built in the middle of the 6th century and decorated with mosaics depicting the Theotokos flanked by angels and saints.\n\nFragments remain from the mosaics of the Church of Santa Maria Formosa in Pola. These pieces were made during the 6th century by artists from Constantinople. Their pure Byzantine style is different from the contemporary Ravennate mosaics.\n\nVery few early Byzantine mosaics survived the Iconoclastic destruction of the 8th century. Among the rare examples are the 6th-century \"Christ in majesty\" (or \"Ezekiel's Vision\") mosaic in the apse of the Church of Hosios David in Thessaloniki that was hidden behind mortar during those dangerous times. Nine mosaic panels in the Hagios Demetrios Church, which were made between 634 and 730, also escaped destruction. Unusually almost all represent Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki, often with suppliants before him.\n\nIn the Iconoclastic era, figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry. The Iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the Hagia Irene in Constantinople (after 740). There were similar crosses in the apses of the Hagia Sophia Church in Thessaloniki and in the Church of the Dormition in Nicaea. The crosses were substituted with the image of the Theotokos in both churches after the victory of the Iconodules (787–797 and in 8th–9th centuries respectively, the Dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922).\n\nA similar Theotokos image flanked by two archangels were made for the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople in 867. The dedication inscription says: \"The images which the impostors had cast down here pious emperors have again set up.\" In the 870s the so-called \"large sekreton\" of the Great Palace of Constantinople was decorated with the images of the four great iconodule patriarchs.\n\nThe post-Iconoclastic era was the heyday of Byzantine art with the most beautiful mosaics executed. The mosaics of the Macedonian Renaissance (867–1056) carefully mingled traditionalism with innovation. Constantinopolitan mosaics of this age followed the decoration scheme first used in Emperor Basil I's Nea Ekklesia. Not only this prototype was later totally destroyed but each surviving composition is battered so it is necessary to move from church to church to reconstruct the system.\n\nAn interesting set of Macedonian-era mosaics make up the decoration of the Hosios Loukas Monastery. In the narthex there is the Crucifixion, the Pantokrator and the Anastasis above the doors, while in the church the Theotokos (apse), Pentecost, scenes from Christ's life and ermit St Loukas (all executed before 1048). The scenes are treated with a minimum of detail and the panels are dominated with the gold setting.\n\nThe Nea Moni Monastery on Chios was established by Constantine Monomachos in 1043–1056. The exceptional mosaic decoration of the dome showing probably the nine orders of the angels was destroyed in 1822 but other panels survived (Theotokos with raised hands, four evangelists with seraphim, scenes from Christ's life and an interesting Anastasis where King Salomon bears resemblance to Constantine Monomachos). In comparison with Osios Loukas Nea Moni mosaics contain more figures, detail, landscape and setting.\n\nAnother great undertaking by Constantine Monomachos was the restoration of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem between 1042 and 1048. Nothing survived of the mosaics which covered the walls and the dome of the edifice but the Russian abbot Daniel, who visited Jerusalem in 1106–1107 left a description: \"Lively mosaics of the holy prophets are under the ceiling, over the tribune. The altar is surmounted by a mosaic image of Christ. In the main altar one can see the mosaic of the Exaltation of Adam. In the apse the Ascension of Christ. The Annunciation occupies the two pillars next to the altar.\"\n\nThe Daphni Monastery houses the best preserved complex of mosaics from the early Comnenan period (ca. 1100) when the austere and hieratic manner typical for the Macedonian epoch and represented by the awesome Christ Pantocrator image inside the dome, was metamorphosing into a more intimate and delicate style, of which \"The Angel before St Joachim\" — with its pastoral backdrop, harmonious gestures and pensive lyricism — is considered a superb example.\n\nThe 9th- and 10th-century mosaics of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople are truly classical Byzantine artworks. The north and south tympana beneath the dome was decorated with figures of prophets, saints and patriarchs. Above the principal door from the narthex we can see an \"Emperor kneeling before Christ\" (late 9th or early 10th century). Above the door from the southwest vestibule to the narthex another mosaic shows the \"Theotokos with Justinian and Constantine\". Justinian I is offering the model of the church to Mary while Constantine is holding a model of the city in his hand. Both emperors are beardless – this is an example for conscious archaization as contemporary Byzantine rulers were bearded. A mosaic panel on the gallery shows \"Christ with Constantine Monomachos and Empress Zoe\" (1042–1055). The emperor gives a bulging money sack to Christ as a donation for the church.\n\nThe dome of the Hagia Sophia Church in Thessaloniki is decorated with an \"Ascension\" mosaic (c. 885). The composition resembles the great baptistries in Ravenna, with apostles standing between palms and Christ in the middle. The scheme is somewhat unusual as the standard post-Iconoclastic formula for domes contained only the image of the Pantokrator.\n\nThere are very few existing mosaics from the Komnenian period but this paucity must be due to accidents of survival and gives a misleading impression. The only surviving 12th-century mosaic work in Constantinople is a panel in Hagia Sophia depicting Emperor John II and Empress Eirene with the Theotokos (1122–34). The empress with her long braided hair and rosy cheeks is especially capturing. It must be a lifelike portrayal because Eirene was really a redhead as her original Hungarian name, \"Piroska\" shows. The adjacent portrait of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos on a pier (from 1122) is similarly personal. The imperial mausoleum of the Komnenos dynasty, the Pantokrator Monastery was certainly decorated with great mosaics but these were later destroyed. The lack of Komnenian mosaics outside the capital is even more apparent. There is only a \"Communion of the Apostles\" in the apse of the cathedral of Serres.\n\nA striking technical innovation of the Komnenian period was the production of very precious, miniature mosaic icons. In these icons the small tesserae (with sides of 1 mm or less) were set on wax or resin on a wooden panel. These products of extraordinary craftmanship were intended for private devotion. The Louvre Transfiguration is a very fine example from the late 12th century. The miniature mosaic of Christ in the Museo Nazionale at Florence illustrates the more gentle, humanistic conception of Christ which appeared in the 12th century.\n\nThe sack of Constantinople in 1204 caused the decline of mosaic art for the next five decades. After the reconquest of the city by Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261 the Hagia Sophia was restored and a beautiful new \"Deesis\" was made on the south gallery. This huge mosaic panel with figures two and a half times lifesize is really overwhelming due to its grand scale and superlative craftsmanship. The Hagia Sophia \"Deesis\" is probably the most famous Byzantine mosaic in Constantinople.\n\nThe Pammakaristos Monastery was restored by Michael Glabas, an imperial official, in the late 13th century. Only the mosaic decoration of the small burial chapel (parekklesion) of Glabas survived. This domed chapel was built by his widow, Martha around 1304–08. In the miniature dome the traditional Pantokrator can be seen with twelve prophets beneath. Unusually the apse is decorated with a \"Deesis\", probably due to the funerary function of the chapel.\n\nThe Church of the Holy Apostles in Thessaloniki was built in 1310–14. Although some vandal systematically removed the gold tesserae of the background it can be seen that the Pantokrator and the prophets in the dome follow the traditional Byzantine pattern. Many details are similar to the Pammakaristos mosaics so it is supposed that the same team of mosaicists worked in both buildings. Another building with a related mosaic decoration is the Theotokos Paregoritissa Church in Arta. The church was established by the Despot of Epirus in 1294–96. In the dome is the traditional stern Pantokrator, with prophets and cherubim below.\nThe greatest mosaic work of the Palaeologan renaissance in art is the decoration of the Chora Church in Constantinople. Although the mosaics of the naos have not survived except three panels, the decoration of the exonarthex and the esonarthex constitute the most important full-scale mosaic cycle in Constantinople after the Hagia Sophia. They were executed around 1320 by the command of Theodore Metochites. The esonarthex has two fluted domes, specially created to provide the ideal setting for the mosaic images of the ancestors of Christ. The southern one is called the Dome of the Pantokrator while the northern one is the Dome of the Theotokos. The most important panel of the esonarthex depicts Theodore Metochites wearing a huge turban, offering the model of the church to Christ. The walls of both narthexes are decorated with mosaic cycles from the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ. These panels show the influence of the Italian trecento on Byzantine art especially the more natural settings, landscapes, figures.\n\nThe last Byzantine mosaic work was created for the Hagia Sophia, Constantinople in the middle of the 14th century. The great eastern arch of the cathedral collapsed in 1346, bringing down the third of the main dome. By 1355 not only the big Pantokrator image was restored but new mosaics were set on the eastern arch depicting the Theotokos, the Baptist and Emperor John V Palaiologos (discovered only in 1989).\n\nIn addition to the large-scale monuments several miniature mosaic icons of outstanding quality was produced for the Palaiologos court and nobles. The loveliest examples from the 14th century are \"Annunciation\" in the Victoria and Albert Museum and a mosaic diptych in the Cathedral Treasury of Florence representing the \"Twelve Feasts of the Church\".\n\nIn the troubled years of the 15th century the fatally weakened empire could not afford luxurious mosaics. Churches were decorated with wall-paintings in this era and after the Turkish conquest.\n\nThe last great period of Roman mosaic art was the 12th–13th century when Rome developed its own distinctive artistic style, free from the strict rules of eastern tradition and with a more realistic portrayal of figures in the space. Well-known works of this period are the floral mosaics of the Basilica di San Clemente, the façade of Santa Maria in Trastevere and San Paolo fuori le Mura. The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere (1140) depicts Christ and Mary sitting next to each other on the heavenly throne, the first example of this iconographic scheme. A similar mosaic, the Coronation of the Virgin, decorates the apse of Santa Maria Maggiore. It is a work of Jacopo Torriti from 1295. The mosaics of Torriti and Jacopo da Camerino in the apse of San Giovanni in Laterano from 1288–94 were thoroughly restored in 1884. The apse mosaic of San Crisogono is attributed to Pietro Cavallini, the greatest Roman painter of the 13th century. Six scenes from the life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also executed by Cavallini in 1290. These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts at perspective. There is an interesting mosaic medaillon from 1210 above the gate of the church of San Tommaso in Formis showing Christ enthroned between a white and a black slave. The church belonged to the Order of the Trinitarians which was devoted to ransoming Christian slaves.\n\nThe great \"Navicella\" mosaic (1305–1313) in the atrium of the Old St. Peter's is attributed to Giotto di Bondone. The giant mosaic, commissioned by Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi, was originally situated on the eastern porch of the old basilica and occupied the whole wall above the entrance arcade facing the courtyard. It depicted St. Peter walking on the waters. This extraordinary work was mainly destroyed during the construction of the new St. Peter's in the 17th century. Navicella means \"little ship\" referring to the large boat which dominated the scene, and whose sail, filled by the storm, loomed over the horizon. Such a natural representation of a seascape was known only from ancient works of art.\n\nThe heyday of mosaic making in Sicily was the age of the independent Norman kingdom in the 12th century. The Norman kings adopted the Byzantine tradition of mosaic decoration to enhance the somewhat dubious legality of their rule. Greek masters working in Sicily developed their own style, that shows the influence of Western European and Islamic artistic tendencies. Best examples of Sicilian mosaic art are the Cappella Palatina of Roger II, the Martorana church in Palermo and the cathedrals of Cefalù and Monreale.\n\nThe Cappella Palatina clearly shows evidence for blending the eastern and western styles. The dome (1142–42) and the eastern end of the church (1143–1154) were decorated with typical Byzantine mosaics i.e. Pantokrator, angels, scenes from the life of Christ. Even the inscriptions are written in Greek. The narrative scenes of the nave (Old Testament, life of Sts Peter and Paul) are resembling to the mosaics of the Old St. Peter's and St. Paul's Basilica in Rome (Latin inscriptions, 1154–66).\n\nThe Martorana church (decorated around 1143) looked originally even more Byzantine although important parts were later demolished. The dome mosaic is similar to that of the Cappella Palatina, with Christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed, elongated angels. The Greek inscriptions, decorative patterns, and evangelists in the squinches are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on the Cappella Palatina. The mosaic depicting Roger II of Sicily, dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ, was originally in the demolished narthex together with another panel, the Theotokos with Georgios of Antiochia, the founder of the church.\n\nIn Cefalù (1148) only the high, French Gothic presbytery was covered with mosaics: the Pantokrator on the semidome of the apse and cherubim on the vault. On the walls are Latin and Greek saints, with Greek inscriptions.\nThe Monreale mosaics constitute the largest decoration of this kind in Italy, covering 0,75 hectares with at least 100 million glass and stone tesserae. This huge work was executed between 1176 and 1186 by the order of King William II of Sicily. The iconography of the mosaics in the presbytery is similar to Cefalu while the pictures in the nave are almost the same as the narrative scenes in the Cappella Palatina. The Martorana mosaic of Roger II blessed by Christ was repeated with the figure of King William II instead of his predecessor. Another panel shows the king offering the model of the cathedral to the Theotokos.\n\nThe Cathedral of Palermo, rebuilt by Archbishop Walter in the same time (1172–85), was also decorated with mosaics but none of these survived except the 12th-century image of \"Madonna del Tocco\" above the western portal.\n\nThe cathedral of Messina, consecrated in 1197, was also decorated with a great mosaic cycle, originally on par with Cefalù and Monreale, but heavily damaged and restored many times later. In the left apse of the same cathedral 14th-century mosaics survived, representing the Madonna and Child between Saints Agata and Lucy, the Archangels Gabriel and Michael and Queens Eleonora and Elisabetta.\n\nSouthern Italy was also part of the Norman kingdom but great mosaics did not survive in this area except the fine mosaic pavement of the Otranto Cathedral from 1166, with mosaics tied into a tree of life, mostly still preserved. The scenes depict biblical characters, warrior kings, medieval beasts, allegories of the months and working activity. Only fragments survived from the original mosaic decoration of Amalfi's Norman Cathedral. The mosaic ambos in the churches of Ravello prove that mosaic art was widespread in Southern Italy during the 11th–13th centuries.\n\nThe palaces of the Norman kings were decorated with mosaics depicting animals and landscapes. The secular mosaics are seemingly more Eastern in character than the great religious cycles and show a strong Persian influence. The most notable examples are the \"Sala di Ruggero\" in the Palazzo dei Normanni, Palermo and the \"Sala della Fontana\" in the Zisa summer palace, both from the 12th century.\n\nIn parts of Italy, which were under eastern artistic influences, like Sicily and Venice, mosaic making never went out of fashion in the Middle Ages. The whole interior of the St Mark's Basilica in Venice is clad with elaborate, golden mosaics. The oldest scenes were executed by Greek masters in the late 11th century but the majority of the mosaics are works of local artists from the 12th–13th centuries. The decoration of the church was finished only in the 16th century. One hundred and ten scenes of mosaics in the atrium of St Mark's were based directly on the miniatures of the Cotton Genesis, a Byzantine manuscript that was brought to Venice after the sack of Constantinople (1204). The mosaics were executed in the 1220s.\n\nOther important Venetian mosaics can be found in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta in Torcello from the 12th century, and in the Basilical of Santi Maria e Donato in Murano with a restored apse mosaic from the 12th century and a beautiful mosaic pavement (1140). The apse of the San Cipriano Church in Murano was decorated with an impressive golden mosaic from the early 13th century showing Christ enthroned with Mary, St John and the two patron saints, Cipriano and Cipriana. When the church was demolished in the 19th century, the mosaic was bought by Frederick William IV of Prussia. It was reassembled in the Friedenskirche of Potsdam in the 1840s.\n\nTrieste was also an important center of mosaic art. The mosaics in the apse of the Cathedral of San Giusto were laid by master craftsmen from Veneto in the 12th–13th centuries.\n\nThe monastery of Grottaferrata founded by Greek Basilian monks and consecrated by the Pope in 1024 was decorated with Italo-Byzantine mosaics, some of which survived in the narthex and the interior. The mosaics on the triumphal arch portray the Twelve Apostles sitting beside an empty throne, evoking Christ's ascent to Heaven. It is a Byzantine work of the 12th century. There is a beautiful 11th-century Deesis above the main portal.\n\nThe Abbot of Monte Cassino, Desiderius sent envoys to Constantinople some time after 1066 to hire expert Byzantine mosaicists for the decoration of the rebuilt abbey church. According to chronicler Leo of Ostia the Greek artists decorated the apse, the arch and the vestibule of the basilica. Their work was admired by contemporaries but was totally destroyed in later centuries except two fragments depicting greyhounds (now in the Monte Cassino Museum). \"The abbot in his wisdom decided that great number of young monks in the monastery should be thoroughly initiated in these arts\" – says the chronicler about the role of the Greeks in the revival of mosaic art in medieval Italy.\nIn Florence a magnificiant mosaic of the Last Judgement decorates the dome of the Baptistery. The earliest mosaics, works of art of many unknown Venetian craftsmen (including probably Cimabue), date from 1225. The covering of the ceiling was probably not completed until the 14th century.\n\nThe impressive mosaic of Christ in Majesty, flanked by the Blessed Virgin and St. John the Evangelist in the apse of the cathedral of Pisa was designed by Cimabue in 1302. It evokes the Monreale mosaics in style. It survived the great fire of 1595 which destroyed most of the mediveval interior decoration.\n\nSometimes not only church interiors but façades were also decorated with mosaics in Italy like in the case of the St Mark's Basilica in Venice (mainly from the 17th–19th centuries, but the oldest one from 1270–75, \"The burial of St Mark in the first basilica\"), the Cathedral of Orvieto (golden Gothic mosaics from the 14th century, many times redone) and the Basilica di San Frediano in Lucca (huge, striking golden mosaic representing the Ascension of Christ with the apostles below, designed by Berlinghiero Berlinghieri in the 13th century). The Cathedral of Spoleto is also decorated on the upper façade with a huge mosaic portraying the \"Blessing Christ\" (signed by one Solsternus from 1207).\n\nBeyond the Alps the first important example of mosaic art was the decoration of the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, commissioned by Charlemagne. It was completely destroyed in a fire in 1650. A rare example of surviving Carolingian mosaics is the apse semi-dome decoration of the oratory of Germigny-des-Prés built in 805–806 by Theodulf, bishop of Orléans, a leading figure of the Carolingian renaissance. This unique work of art, rediscovered only in the 19th century, had no followers.\n\nOnly scant remains prove that mosaics were still used in the Early Middle Ages. The Abbey of Saint-Martial in Limoges, originally an important place of pilgrimage, was totally demolished during the French Revolution except its crypt which was rediscovered in the 1960s. A mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century. It somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble, probably taken from antique pavements. This could also be the case with the early 9th century mosaic found under the Basilica of Saint-Quentin in Picardy, where antique motifs are copied but using only simple colors. The mosaics in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean at Lyon have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique simple colors. More fragments were found on the site of Saint-Croix at Poitiers which might be from the 6th or 9th century.\n\nLater fresco replaced the more labor-intensive technique of mosaic in Western-Europe, although mosaics were sometimes used as decoration on medieval cathedrals. The Royal Basilica of the Hungarian kings in Székesfehérvár (Alba Regia) had a mosaic decoration in the apse. It was probably a work of Venetian or Ravennese craftsmen, executed in the first decades of the 11th century. The mosaic was almost totally destroyed together with the basilica in the 17th century. The Golden Gate of the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague got its name from the golden 14th-century mosaic of the Last Judgement above the portal. It was executed by Venetian craftsmen.\nThe Crusaders in the Holy Land also adopted mosaic decoration under local Byzantine influence. During their 12th-century reconstruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem they complemented the existing Byzantine mosaics with new ones. Almost nothing of them survived except the \"Ascension of Christ\" in the Latin Chapel (now confusingly surrounded by many 20th-century mosaics). More substantial fragments were preserved from the 12th-century mosaic decoration of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. The mosaics in the nave are arranged in five horizontal bands with the figures of the ancestors of Christ, Councils of the Church and angels. In the apses the Annunciation, the Nativity, Adoration of the Magi and Dormition of the Blessed Virgin can be seen. The program of redecoration of the church was completed in 1169 as a unique collaboration of the Byzantine emperor, the king of Jerusalem and the Latin Church.\n\nIn 2003, the remains of a mosaic pavement were discovered under the ruins of the Bizere Monastery near the River Mureş in present-day Romania. The panels depict real or fantastic animal, floral, solar and geometric representations. Some archeologists supposed that it was the floor of an Orthodox church, built some time between the 10th and 11th century. Other experts claim that it was part of the later Catholic monastery on the site because it shows the signs of strong Italianate influence. The monastery was situated that time in the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nAlthough mosaics went out of fashion and were substituted by frescoes, some of the great Renaissance artists also worked with the old technique. Raphael's Creation of the World in the dome of the Chigi Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo is a notable example that was executed by a Venetian craftsman, Luigi di Pace.\n\nDuring the papacy of Clement VIII (1592–1605), the “Congregazione della Reverenda Fabbrica di San Pietro\" was established, providing an independent organisation charged with completing the decorations in the newly built St. Peter's Basilica. Instead of frescoes the cavernous Basilica was mainly decorated with mosaics. Among the explanations are:\n\nThe mosaics of St. Peter's often show lively Baroque compositions based on designs or canvases from like Ciro Ferri, Guido Reni, Domenichino, Carlo Maratta, and many others. Raphael is represented by a mosaic replica of this last painting, the Transfiguration. Many different artists contributed to the 17th- and 18th-century mosaics in St. Peter's, including Giovanni Battista Calandra, Fabio Cristofari (died 1689), and Pietro Paolo Cristofari (died 1743). Works of the Fabbrica were often used as papal gifts.\n\nThe eastern provinces of the Eastern Roman and later the Byzantine Empires inherited a strong artistic tradition from the Late Antiquity. Similarly to Italy and Constantinople churches and important secular buildings in the region of Syria and Egypt were decorated with elaborate mosaic panels between the 5th and 8th centuries. The great majority of these works of art were later destroyed but archeological excavations unearthed many surviving examples.\n\nThe single most important piece of Byzantine Christian mosaic art in the East is the Madaba Map, made between 542 and 570 as the floor of the church of Saint George at Madaba, Jordan. It was rediscovered in 1894. The Madaba Map is the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of the Holy Land. It depicts an area from Lebanon in the north to the Nile Delta in the south, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Eastern Desert. The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is Jerusalem, at the center of the map. The map is enriched with many naturalistic features, like animals, fishing boats, bridges and palm trees\n\nOne of the earliest examples of Byzantine mosaic art in the region can be found on Mount Nebo, an important place of pilgrimage in the Byzantine era where Moses died. Among the many 6th-century mosaics in the church complex (discovered after 1933) the most interesting one is located in the baptistery. The intact floor mosaic covers an area of 9 x 3 m and was laid down in 530. It depicts hunting and pastoral scenes with rich Middle Eastern flora and fauna.\n\nThe Church of Sts. Lot and Procopius was founded in 567 in Nebo village under Mount Nebo (now Khirbet Mukhayyat). Its floor mosaic depicts everyday activities like grape harvest. Another two spectacular mosaics were discovered in the ruined Church of Preacher John nearby. One of the mosaics was placed above the other one which was completely covered and unknown until the modern restoration. The figures on the older mosaic have thus escaped the iconoclasts.\n\nThe town of Madaba remained an important center of mosaic making during the 5th–8th centuries. In the Church of the Apostles the middle of the main panel Thalassa, goddess of the sea, can be seen surrounded by fishes and other sea creatures. Native Middle Eastern birds, mammals, plants and fruits were also added.\nImportant Justinian era mosaics decorated the Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt. Generally wall mosaics have not survived in the region because of the destruction of buildings but the St. Catherine's Monastery is exceptional. On the upper wall Moses is shown in two panels on a landscape background. In the apse we can see the Transfiguration of Jesus on a golden background. The apse is surrounded with bands containing medallions of apostles and prophets, and two contemporary figure, \"Abbot Longinos\" and \"John the Deacon\". The mosaic was probably created in 565/6.\n\nJerusalem with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions. The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city. The most important is the so-called \"Armenian Mosaic\" which was discovered in 1894 on the Street of the Prophets near Damascus Gate. It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters, which springs from a vase. Populating the vine's branches are peacocks, ducks, storks, pigeons, an eagle, a partridge, and a parrot in a cage. The inscription reads: \"For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows.\" Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small, natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries. The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a mortuary chapel.\n\nAn exceptionally well preserved, carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in Bethany, the early Byzantine church of the Lazarium which was built between 333 and 390. Because of its purely geometrical pattern, the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas, especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem. A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple geometric mosaic floor.\nThe monastic communities of the Judean Desert also decorated their monasteries with mosaic floors. The Monastery of Martyrius was founded in the end of the 5th century and it was re-discovered in 1982–85. The most important work of art here is the intact geometric mosaic floor of the refectory although the severely damaged church floor was similarly rich. The mosaics in the church of the nearby Monastery of Euthymius are of later date (discovered in 1930). They were laid down in the Umayyad era, after a devastating earthquake in 659. Two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features.\nMosaic art also flourished in Christian Petra where three Byzantine churches were discovered. The most important one was uncovered in 1990. It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual. The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century. In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed. They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals, and personifications of the Seasons, Ocean, Earth and Wisdom.\n\nThe Arab conquest of the Middle East in the 7th century did not break off the art of mosaic making. Arabs learned and accepted the craft as their own and carried on the classical tradition. During the Umayyad era Christianity retained its importance, churches were built and repaired and some of the most important mosaics of the Christian East were made during the 8th century when the region was under Islamic rule.\n\nThe mosaics of the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa (now Umm ar-Rasas) were made in 785 (discovered after 1986). The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan. On the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region. The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative. Six mosaic masters signed the work: Staurachios from Esbus, Euremios, Elias, Constantinus, Germanus and Abdela. It overlays another, damaged, mosaic floor of the earlier (587) \"Church of Bishop Sergius.\" Another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration.\n\nThe last great mosaics in Madaba were made in 767 in the Church of the Virgin Mary (discovered in 1887). It is a masterpiece of the geometric style with a Greek inscription in the central medallion.\n\nWith the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750 the Middle East went through deep cultural changes. No great mosaics were made after the end of the 8th century and the majority of churches gradually fell into disrepair and were eventually destroyed. The tradition of mosaic making died out among the Christians and also in the Islamic community.\n\nThe craft has also been popular in early medieval Rus, inherited as part of the Byzantine tradition. Yaroslav, the Grand Prince of the Kievan Rus' built a large cathedral in his capital, Kiev. The model of the church was the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, and it was also called Saint Sophia Cathedral. It was built mainly by Byzantine master craftsmen, sent by Constantine Monomachos, between 1037 and 1046. Naturally the more important surfaces in the interior were decorated with golden mosaics. In the dome we can see the traditional stern Pantokrator supported by angels. Between the 12 windows of the drum were apostles and the four evangelists on the pendentives. The apse is dominated by an orant Theotokos with a Deesis in three medallions above. Below is a Communion of the Apostles.\n\nPrince Sviatopolk II built St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kiev in 1108. The mosaics of the church are undoubtedly works of Byzantine artists. Although the church was destroyed by Soviet authorities, majority of the panels were preserved. Small parts of ornamental mosaic decoration from the 12th century survived in the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod but this church was largely decorated with frescoes.\n\nUsing mosaics and frescoes in the same building was a unique practice in Ukraine. Harmony was achieved by using the same dominant colors in mosaic and fresco. Both Saint Sophia Cathedral and Saint Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kiev use this technique. Mosaics stopped being used for church decoration as early as the 12th century in the eastern Slavic countries. Later Russian churches were decorated with frescoes, similarly then orthodox churches in the Balkan.\n\nThe apse mosaic of the Gelati Monastery is a rare example of mosaic use in Georgia. Began by king David IV and completed by his son Demetrius I of Georgia, the fragmentary panel depicts Theotokos flanked by two archangels. The use of mosaic in Gelati attests to some Byzantine influence in the country and was a demonstration of the imperial ambition of the Bagrationids. The mosaic covered church could compete in magnificence with the churches of Constantinople. Gelati is one of few mosaic creations which survived in Georgia but fragments prove that the early churches of Pitsunda and Tsromi were also decorated with mosaic as well as other, lesser known sites. The destroyed 6th century mosaic floors in the Pitsunda Cathedral have been inspired by Roman prototypes. In Tsromi the tesserae are still visible on the walls of the 7th-century church but only faint lines hint at the original scheme. Its central figure was Christ standing and displaying a scroll with Georgian text.\n\nUnder Roman and Byzantine influence the Jews also decorated their synagogues with classical floor mosaics. Many interesting examples were discovered in Galilee and the Judean Desert.\n\nThe remains of a 6th-century synagogue have been uncovered in Sepphoris, which was an important centre of Jewish culture between the 3rd–7th centuries and a multicultural town inhabited by Jews, Christians and pagans. The mosaic reflects an interesting fusion of Jewish and pagan beliefs. In the center of the floor the zodiac wheel was depicted. Helios sits in the middle, in his sun chariot, and each zodiac is matched with a Jewish month. Along the sides of the mosaic are strips depicting Biblical scenes, such as the binding of Isaac, as well as traditional rituals, including a burnt sacrifice and the offering of fruits and grains.\n\nAnother zodiac mosaic decorated the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue which was built during the reign of Justin I (518–27). It is regarded one of the most important mosaics discovered in Israel. Each of its three panels depicts a scene – the Holy Ark, the zodiac, and the story of the sacrifice of Isaac. In the center of the zodiac is Helios, the sun god, in his chariot. The four women in the corners of the mosaic represent the four seasons.\n\nA third superbly preserved zodiac mosaic was discovered in the Severus synagogue in the ancient resort town of Hammat Tiberias. In the center of the 4th-century mosaic the Sun god, Helios sits in his chariot holding the celestial sphere and a whip. Nine of the 12 signs of the zodiac survived intact. Another panel shows the Ark of Covenant and Jewish cultic objects used in the Temple at Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1936, a synagogue was excavated in Jericho which was named Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue after an inscription on its mosaic floor (\"Peace on Israel\"). It appears to have been in use from the 5th to 8th centuries and contained a big mosaic on the floor with drawings of the Ark of the Covenant, the Menorah, a Shofar and a Lulav. Nearby in Naaran, there is another synagogue (discovered in 1918) from the 6th century that also has a mosaic floor.\n\nThe synagogue in Eshtemoa (As-Samu) was built around the 4th century. The mosaic floor is decorated with only floral and geometric patterns. The synagogue in Khirbet Susiya (excavated in 1971–72, founded in the end of the 4th century) has three mosaic panels, the eastern one depicting a Torah shrine, two menorahs, a lulav and an etrog with columns, deer and rams. The central panel is geometric while the western one is seriously damaged but it has been suggested that it depicted Daniel in the lion’s den. The Roman synagogue in Ein Gedi was remodeled in the Byzantine era and a more elaborate mosaic floor was laid down above the older white panels. The usual geometric design was enriched with birds in the center. It includes the names of the signs of the zodiac and important figures from the Jewish past but not their images suggesting that it served a rather conservative community.\n\nThe ban on figurative depiction was not taken so seriously by the Jews living in Byzantine Gaza. In 1966 remains of a synagogue were found in the ancient harbour area. Its mosaic floor depicts King David as Orpheus, identified by his name in Hebrew letters. Near him were lion cubs, a giraffe and a snake listening to him playing a lyre. A further portion of the floor was divided by medallions formed by vine leaves, each of which contains an animal: a lioness suckling her cub, a giraffe, peacocks, panthers, bears, a zebra and so on. The floor was paved in 508/509. It is very similar to that of the synagogue at Maon (Menois) and the Christian church at Shellal, suggesting that the same artist most probably worked at all three places.\n\nThe House of Leontius in Bet She'an (excavated in 1964–72) is a rare example of a synagogue which was part of an inn. It was built in the Byzantine period. The colorful mosaic floor of the synagogue room had an outer stripe decorated with flowers and birds, around medallions with animals, created by vine trellises emerging from an amphora. The central medallion enclosed a menorah (candelabrum) beneath the word shalom (peace).\n\nA 5th-century building in Huldah may be a Samaritan synagogue. Its mosaic floor contains typical Jewish symbols (menorah, lulav, etrog) but the inscriptions are Greek. Another Samaritan synagogue with a mosaic floor was located in Bet She'an (excavated in 1960). The floor had only decorative motifs and an aedicule (shrine) with cultic symbols. The ban on human or animal images was more strictly observed by the Samaritans than their Jewish neighbours in the same town (see above). The mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue. One of the inscriptions was written in Samaritan script.\n\nIn 2003, a synagogue of the 5th or 6th century was uncovered in the coastal Ionian town of Saranda, Albania. It had exceptional mosaics depicting items associated with Jewish holidays, including a menorah, ram's horn, and lemon tree. Mosaics in the basilica of the synagogue show the facade of what resembles a Torah, animals, trees, and other biblical symbols. The structure measures 20 by 24 m. and was probably last used in the 6th century as a church.\n\nIn South Arabia two mosaic works were excavated in a Qatabanian from the late 3rd century, those two plates formed geometric and grapevines formation reflecting the traditions of that culture. In the Ghassanid era religious mosaic art flourished in their territory, so far five churches with mosaic were recorded from that era, two built by Ghassanid rulers and the other three by the Christian Arab community who wrote their names and dedications.\n\nTilework had been known there for about two thousand years when cultural exchange between Sassanid Empire and Romans influenced Persian artists to create mosaic patterns. Shapur I decorated his palace with tile compositions depicting dancers, musicians, courtesans, etc. This was the only significant example of figurative Persian mosaic, which became prohibited after Arab conquest and arrival of Islam.\n\nIslamic architecture used mosaic technique to decorate religious buildings and palaces after the Muslim conquests of the eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire. In Syria and Egypt the Arabs were influenced by the great tradition of Roman and Early Christian mosaic art. During the Umayyad Dynasty mosaic making remained a flourishing art form in Islamic culture and it is continued in the art of zellige and azulejo in various parts of the Arab world, although tile was to become the main Islamic form of wall decoration.\n\nThe first great religious building of Islam, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, which was built between 688–692, was decorated with glass mosaics both inside and outside, by craftsmen of the Byzantine tradition. Only parts of the original interior decoration survive. The rich floral motifs follow Byzantine traditions, and are \"Islamic only in the sense that the vocabulary is syncretic and does not include representation of men or animals.\"\nThe most important early Islamic mosaic work is the decoration of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, then capital of the Arab Caliphate. The mosque was built between 706 and 715. The caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine Emperor to decorate the building. This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration. The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees, flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background. The mosaics include no human figures, which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works. The biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard, called the \"Barada Panel\" after the river Barada. It is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world, at over 4 m. In 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively, and many mosaics were lost, although some have been restored since.\n\nThe mosaics of the Umayyad Mosque gave inspiration to later Damascene mosaic works. The Dome of the Treasury, which stands in the mosque courtyard, is covered with fine mosaics, probably dating from 13th- or 14th-century restoration work. The style of them are strikingly similar to the Barada Panel. The mausoleum of Sultan Baibars, Madrassa Zahiriyah, which was built after 1277, is also decorated with a band of golden floral and architectural mosaics, running around inside the main prayer hall.\n\nNon-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials. They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas, once common in the Eastern Mediterranean. The most superb example can be found in the bath house of Hisham's Palace, Palestine which was made around 744. The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer (right side) and two deers peacefully grazing (left side). The panel probably represents good and bad governance. Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in Anjar, Lebanon. The luxurious desert residence of Al-Walid II in Qasr al-Hallabat (in present-day Jordan) was also decorated with floor mosaics that show a high level of technical skill. The best preserved panel at Hallabat is divided by a Tree of Life flanked by \"good\" animals on one side and \"bad\" animals on the other. Among the Hallabat representations are vine scrolls, grapes, pomegranates, oryx, wolves, hares, a leopard, pairs of partridges, fish, bulls, ostriches, rabbits, rams, goats, lions and a snake. At Qastal, near Amman, excavations in 2000 uncovered the earliest known Umayyad mosaics in present-day Jordan, dating probably from the caliphate of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (685–705). They cover much of the floor of a finely decorated building that probably served as the palace of a local governor. The Qastal mosaics depict geometrical patterns, trees, animals, fruits and rosettes. Except for the open courtyard, entrance and staircases, the floors of the entire palace were covered in mosaics.\n\nSome of the best examples of later Islamic mosaics were produced in Moorish Spain. The golden mosaics in the mihrab and the central dome of the Great Mosque in Corduba have a decidedly Byzantine character. They were made between 965 and 970 by local craftsmen, supervised by a master mosaicist from Constantinople, who was sent by the Byzantine Emperor to the Umayyad Caliph of Spain. The decoration is composed of colorful floral arabesques and wide bands of Arab calligraphy. The mosaics were purported to evoke the glamour of the Great Mosque in Damascus, which was lost for the Umayyad family.\n\nMosaics generally went out of fashion in the Islamic world after the 8th century. Similar effects were achieved by the use of painted tilework, either geometric with small tiles, sometimes called mosaic, like the zillij of North Africa, or larger tiles painted with parts of a large decorative scheme (Qashani) in Persia, Turkey and further east.\n\nNoted 19th-century mosaics include those by Edward Burne-Jones at St Pauls within the Walls in Rome. Another modern mosaic of note is the world's largest mosaic installation located at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, located in St. Louis, Missouri. A modern example of mosaic is the Museum of Natural History station of the New York City Subway (there are many such works of art scattered throughout the New York City subway system, though many IND stations are usually designed with bland mosaics.) Another example of mosaics in ordinary surroundings is the use of locally themed mosaics in some restrooms in the rest areas along some Texas interstate highways.\n\nSome modern mosaics are the work of \"modernisme\" style architects Antoni Gaudí and Josep Maria Jujol, for example the mosaics in the Park Güell in Barcelona. Today, among the leading figures of the mosaic world are Emma Biggs (UK), Marcelo de Melo (Brazil), Sonia King (USA) and Saimir Strati (Albania).\n\nMosaics have developed into a popular craft and art, and are not limited to professionals. Today's artisans and crafters work with stone, ceramics, shells, art glass, mirror, beads, and even odd items like doll parts, pearls, or photographs. While ancient mosaics tended to be architectural, modern mosaics are found covering everything from park benches and flowerpots to guitars and bicycles. Items can be as small as an earring or as large as a house.\n\nIn styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic, street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork. The most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the French Invader. He has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles, the first of which are small \"traditional\" tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character, installed in cities across the globe, and the second of which are a style he refers to as \"Rubikcubism\", which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled Rubik's Cubes. Although he is the most prominent, other street and urban artists do work in Mosaic styles as well.\n\nPortuguese pavement (in Portuguese, \"Calçada Portuguesa\") is a kind of two-tone stone mosaic paving created in Portugal, and common throughout the Lusosphere. Most commonly taking the form of geometric patterns from the simple to the complex, it also is used to create complex pictorial mosaics in styles ranging from iconography to classicism and even modern design. In Portuguese-speaking countries, many cities have a large amount of their sidewalks and even, though far more occasionally, streets done in this mosaic form. Lisbon in particular maintains almost all walkways in this style.\nDespite its prevalence and popularity throughout Portugal and its former colonies, and its relation to older art and architectural styles like Azulejo, Portuguese and Spanish painted tilework, it is a relatively young mosaic artform, its first definitive appearance in a modernly recognizable form being in the mid-1800s. Among the most commonly used stones in this style are basalt and limestone.\n\nMosaic is an art form which uses small pieces of materials placed together to create a unified whole. The materials commonly used are marble or other stone, glass, pottery, mirror or foil-backed glass, or shells.\n\nThe word \"mosaic\" is from the Italian \"mosaico\" deriving from the Latin \"mosaicus\" and ultimately from the Greek \"mouseios\" meaning \"belonging to the Muses\", hence artistic. Each piece of material is a Tessera (plural: \"tesserae\"). The space in between where the grout goes is an interstice. Andamento is the word used to describe the movement and flow of Tesserae. The 'opus', the Latin for ‘work’, is the way in which the pieces are cut and placed.\n\nCommon techniques include:\n\nThere are three main methods: the direct method, the indirect method and the double indirect method.\n\nThe direct method of mosaic construction involves directly placing (gluing) the individual tesserae onto the supporting surface. This method is well suited to surfaces that have a three-dimensional quality, such as vases. This was used for the historic European wall and ceiling mosaics, following underdrawings of the main outlines on the wall below, which are often revealed again when the mosaic falls away.\n\nThe direct method suits small projects that are transportable. Another advantage of the direct method is that the resulting mosaic is progressively visible, allowing for any adjustments to tile color or placement.\n\nThe disadvantage of the direct method is that the artist must work directly at the chosen surface, which is often not practical for long periods of time, especially for large-scale projects. Also, it is difficult to control the evenness of the finished surface. This is of particular importance when creating a functional surface such as a floor or a table top.\n\nA modern version of the direct method, sometimes called \"double direct,\" is to work directly onto fiberglass mesh. The mosaic can then be constructed with the design visible on the surface and transported to its final location. Large work can be done in this way, with the mosaic being cut up for shipping and then reassembled for installation. It enables the artist to work in comfort in a studio rather than at the site of installation.\n\nThe indirect method of applying tesserae is often used for very large projects, projects with repetitive elements or for areas needing site specific shapes. Tiles are applied face-down to a backing paper using an adhesive, and later transferred onto walls, floors or craft projects. This method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to rework areas, allows the cementing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front, even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses. Mosaic murals, benches and tabletops are some of the items usually made using the indirect method, as it results in a smoother and more even surface.\n\nThe double indirect method can be used when it is important to see the work during the creation process as it will appear when completed. The tesserae are placed face-up on a medium (often adhesive-backed paper, sticky plastic or soft lime or putty) as it will appear when installed. When the mosaic is complete, a similar medium is placed atop it. The piece is then turned over, the original underlying material is carefully removed, and the piece is installed as in the indirect method described above. In comparison to the indirect method, this is a complex system to use and requires great skill on the part of the operator, to avoid damaging the work. Its greatest advantage lies in the possibility of the operator directly controlling the final result of the work, which is important e.g. when the human figure is involved.\nThis method was created in 1989 by Maurizio Placuzzi and registered for industrial use (patent n. 0000222556) under the name of his company, Sicis International Srl, now Sicis The Art Mosaic Factory Srl.\n\nThe best way to arrange variously shaped tiles on a surface leads to the mathematical field of tessellation.\n\nThe artist M. C. Escher was influenced by Moorish mosaics to begin his investigations into tessellation. \n\nA mosaic in digital imaging is a plurality of non-overlapping images, arranged in some tessellation. A photomosaic is a picture made up of various other pictures (pioneered by Joseph Francis), in which each \"pixel\" is another picture, when examined closely. This form has been adopted in many modern media and digital image searches.\n\nA tile mosaic is a digital image made up of individual tiles, arranged in a non-overlapping fashion, e.g. to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor, by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles (a typical size is , as for example, on the floor of the University of Toronto pool, though sometimes larger tiles such as are used). These digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text, such as the depth of the pool in various places, but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme.\n\nRecent developments in digital image processing have led to the ability to design physical tile mosaics using computer aided design (CAD) software. The software typically takes as inputs a source bitmap and a palette of colored tiles. The software makes a best-fit match of the tiles to the source image.\nWith high cost of labor in developed countries, production automation has become increasingly popular. Rather than being assembled by hand, mosaics designed using computer aided design (CAD) software can be assembled by a robot. Production can be greater than 10 times faster with higher accuracy.

The group is headquartered in Centennial, Colorado.\n\nIn the late 19th century, post-mortem photography was popular and culturally accepted, though it fell out of style early the next century. This cultural shift was accompanied by a rejection of emotional bonding with stillborn babies, and infants who had died. One journalist observed \"In years past, stillbirths and other perinatal deaths were swept under the carpet. Mothers did not see their children, and were urged not to dwell on them or their deaths.\"\n\nChange in attitudes began in the 1970s and 1980s, and \"the medical and psychological thinking about stillbirth began to evolve when researchers started studying the impact of a baby's death and parents began telling their stories. From silence and detachment came acknowledgment and remembrance.\"\n\nNow I Lay Me Down to Sleep is part of this increased concern for the emotional needs of grieving parents. Describing their photos, one mother wrote \"They are not gruesome, they are not offensive, they are not graphic, nor are they violent\". She went on to say \"They are real life, in all its beauty and agony.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "50026297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50026297", "title": "Passive learning", "text": "Passive learning\n\nPassive learning is a method of learning or instruction where students receive information from the instructor and internalize it, and \"where the learner receives no feedback from the instructor\". The term is often used together with \"direct instruction\" and \"lecturing\", with passive learning being the result or intended outcome of the instruction. This style of learning is teacher-centered and contrasts to active learning, which is student-centered, whereby students take an active or participatory role in the learning process, and to the Socratic method where students and instructors engage in cooperative argumentative dialogue. Passive learning is a traditional method utilized in factory model schools and modern schools, as well as historic and contemporary religious services in churches (sermons), mosques, and synagogues.\n\nPassive learning is not simply the outcome of an educational model. Passive learners may quietly absorb information and knowledge without typically engaging with the information received or the learning experience. They may not interact with others, share insights, or contribute to a dialogue. An estimated 60 percent of people are passive learners.\n\nThe effectiveness of traditional instruction and passive learning methods have been under debate for some time. The modern origins of progressive education, with active learning as a component, can be traced back to the 18th century works of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, both of whom are known as forerunners of ideas that would be developed by 20th century theorists such as John Dewey. Locke wrote that \"truth and knowledge… arise out of observation and experience rather than manipulation of accepted or given ideas\".\n\nAdvantages of passive learning include: exposure to new material, greater control by the instructor over the classroom, audience, or students; opportunity for a structured and engaging format; ensuring a complement to the subject matter outside of the learning environment and learning space; the ability to clarify course material; presentation of a large amount of information in a short time; instructional materials (lecture notes, handouts, audiovisual media, etc.) can be prepared in advance; important concepts and content can be identified and presented in an organized, structured, and meaningful manner; the potential to facilitate large-class communication. This format can also permit dissemination of materials not yet published or readily available.\n\nA randomized, controlled trial comparing passive (60-minute lecture) and active (30-minute lecture along with interactions between student pairs) showed no differences between the two methods in students' knowledge or attitudes. However, the perception of engagement with the delivered content was lower for the passive learning group.\n\nDisadvantages of passive learning include the required assumption that for learning to be successful, the students will receive the subject matter with \"open minds, like empty vessels or sponges\"; the instructor will fill the minds of the students with knowledge in order to obtain better examination results. Passive learning allows limited opportunity to assess how well students are learning content and for questions, clarification, or discussion. Students may be reticent about letting instructors know they do not understand key information and they may be reluctant to ask questions in class. With no opportunity for application, it does not consistently engage students' use of higher-level cognitive skills. A standard model is lecture-format with one-way communication which does not engage the listener. It also requires the instructor to have effective speaking and presentation skills. Students are expected to wait for information to be provided and then to follow directions on what to do with that information. Emphasis is placed on repeating information without reflecting or demonstrating an understanding. This can result in \"surface processing\" instead of deeper learning, less ability to use what is learned, and the study being deemed irrelevant by the students. The disadvantages of passive learning can be compared to the advantages of active learning. It has been suggested that while active \"engagement\" with material, students, instructors, etc. might be critical to learning, active \"participation\" may not be.\n\n"}
{"id": "63136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63136", "title": "Picaresque novel", "text": "Picaresque novel\n\nThe picaresque novel (Spanish: \"picaresca\", from \"pícaro\", for \"rogue\" or \"rascal\") is a genre of prose fiction that depicts the adventures of a roguish, but \"appealing hero\", of low social class, who lives by his or her wits in a corrupt society. Picaresque novels typically adopt a realistic style, with elements of comedy and satire. This style of novel originated in Spain in 1554 and flourished throughout Europe for more than 200 years, though the term \"picaresque novel\" was only coined in 1810. It continues to influence modern literature. The term is also sometimes used to describe works, like Cervantes' \"Don Quixote\" and Charles Dickens' \"Pickwick Papers\", which only contain some of the genre's elements.\n\nAccording to the traditional view of Thrall and Hibbard (first published in 1936), seven qualities distinguish the picaresque novel or narrative form, all or some of which an author may employ for effect:\n\n\nIn the English-speaking world, the term \"picaresque\" is often used loosely to refer to novels that contain some elements of this genre; e.g. an episodic recounting of adventures on the road.\n\nThe word \"pícaro\" first starts to appear in Spain with the current meaning in 1545, though at the time it had no association with literature. The word \"pícaro\" does not appear in \"Lazarillo de Tormes\" (1554), the novella credited by modern scholars with founding the genre. The expression \"picaresque novel\" was coined in 1810. Whether it has any validity at all as a generic label in the Spanish sixteenth and seventeenth centuries—and Cervantes certainly used \"picaresque\" with a different meaning than it has today—has been called into question. There is unresolved debate within Hispanic studies about what the term means, or meant, and which works were, or should be, so called. The only work clearly called \"picaresque\" by its contemporaries was Mateo Alemán's \"Guzmán de Alfarache\" (1599), which to them was the \"Libro del pícaro\" (The Book of the Pícaro).\n\nWhile elements of Chaucer and Boccaccio have a picaresque feel and may have contributed to the style, the modern picaresque begins with \"Lazarillo de Tormes\", which was published anonymously in 1554 in Burgos, Medina del Campo, and Alcalá de Henares in Spain, and also in Antwerp, which at the time was under Spanish rule as a major city in the Spanish Netherlands. It is variously considered either the first picaresque novel or at least the antecedent of the genre.\n\nThe protagonist, Lázaro, lives by his wits in an effort to survive and succeed in an impoverished country full of hypocrisy. As a \"pícaro\" character, he is an alienated outsider, whose ability to expose and ridicule individuals compromised with society gives him a revolutionary stance. Lázaro states that the motivation for his writing is to communicate his experiences of overcoming deception, hypocrisy, and falsehood (\"engaño\").\n\nThe character type draws on elements of characterization already present in Roman literature, especially Petronius' \"Satyricon\". Lázaro shares some of the traits of the central figure of Encolpius, a former gladiator, though it is unlikely that the author had access to Petronius' work. From the comedies of Plautus, \"Lazarillo\" borrows the figure of the parasite and the supple slave. Other traits are taken from Apuleius's \"The Golden Ass\". \"The Golden Ass\" and \"Satyricon\" are rare surviving samples of the \"Milesian tale\", a popular genre in the classical world, and were revived and widely read in Renaissance Europe.\n\nThe principal episodes of \"Lazarillo\" are based on Arabic folktales that were well-known to the Moorish inhabitants of Spain. The Arabic influence may account for the negative portrayal of priests and other church officials in \"Lazarillo\". Arabic literature, which was read widely in Spain in the time of Al-Andalus and possessed a literary tradition with similar themes, is thus another possible influence on the picaresque style. Al-Hamadhani (d.1008) of Hamadhan (Iran) is credited with inventing the literary genre of \"maqamat\" in which a wandering vagabond makes his living on the gifts his listeners give him following his extemporaneous displays of rhetoric, erudition, or verse, often done with a trickster's touch. Ibn al-Astarkuwi or al-Ashtarkuni (d.1134) also wrote in the genre \"maqamat\", comparable to later European picaresque.\n\nThe curious presence of Russian loan-words in the text of the \"Lazarillo\" also suggests the influence of medieval Slavic tales of tricksters, thieves, itinerant prostitutes, and brigands, who were common figures in the impoverished areas bordering on Germany to the west. When diplomatic ties to Germany and Spain were established under the emperor Charles V, these tales began to be read in Italian translations in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nAs narrator of his own adventures, Lázaro seeks to portray himself as the victim of both his ancestry and his circumstance. This means of appealing to the compassion of the reader would be directly challenged by later picaresque novels such as \"Guzmán de Alfarache\" (1599/1604) and the \"Buscón\" (composed in the first decade of the 17th century and first published in 1626) because the idea of determinism used to cast the \"pícaro\" as a victim clashed with the Counter-Reformation doctrine of free will.\n\nAn early example is Mateo Alemán's \"Guzmán de Alfarache\" (1599), characterized by religiosity. Guzmán de Alfarache is a fictional character who lived in San Juan de Aznalfarache, Seville, Spain.\n\nFrancisco de Quevedo's \"El buscón\" (1604 according to Francisco Rico; the exact date is uncertain, yet it was certainly a very early work) is considered the masterpiece of the subgenre by A. A. Parker, because of his baroque style and the study of the delinquent psychology. However, a more recent school of thought, led by Francisco Rico, rejects Parker's view, contending instead that the protagonist, Pablos, is a highly unrealistic character, simply a means for Quevedo to launch classist, racist and sexist attacks. Moreover, argues Rico, the structure of the novel is radically different from previous works of the picaresque genre: Quevedo uses the conventions of the picaresque as a mere vehicle to show off his abilities with conceit and rhetoric, rather than to construct a satirical critique of Spanish Golden Age society.\n\nMiguel de Cervantes wrote several works \"in the picaresque manner, notably \"Rinconete y Cortadillo\" (1613) and \"El coloquio de los perros\" (1613; “Colloquy of the Dogs”)\". \"Cervantes also incorporated elements of the picaresque into his greatest novel, \"Don Quixote\" (1605, 1615)\", the \"single most important progenitor of the modern novel\", that M. H. Abrams has described as a \"quasi-picaresque narrative\". Here the hero is not a rogue but a foolish knight.\n\nIn order to understand the historical context that led to the development of these paradigmatic picaresque novels in Spain during the 16th and 17th centuries, it is essential to take into consideration the circumstances surrounding the lives of \"conversos,\" whose ancestors had been Jewish, and whose New Christian faith was subjected to close scrutiny and mistrust.\n\nIn other European countries, these Spanish novels were read and imitated. In Germany, Grimmelshausen wrote \"Simplicius Simplicissimus\" (1669), the most important of non-Spanish picaresque novels. It describes the devastation caused by the Thirty Years' War. Le Sage's \"Gil Blas\" (1715) is a classic example of the genre, which in France had declined into an aristocratic adventure. In Britain, the first example is Thomas Nashe's \"The Unfortunate Traveller\" (1594) in which a court page, Jack Wilson, exposes the underclass life in a string of European cities through lively, often brutal descriptions. The body of Tobias Smollett's work, and Daniel Defoe's \"Moll Flanders\" (1722) are considered picaresque, but they lack the sense of religious redemption of delinquency that was very important in Spanish and German novels. The triumph of Moll Flanders is more economic than moral. While the morés of the early 18th Century wouldn't permit Moll to be a heroine per se, Defoe hardly disguises his admiration for her resilience and resourcefulness.\n\nThe autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini, written in Florence beginning in 1558, also has much in common with the picaresque.\n\nThe classic Chinese novel \"Journey to the West\" is considered to have considerable picaresque elements. Having been written in 1590, it is contemporary with much of the above—but is unlikely to have been directly influenced by the European genre.\n\nHenry Fielding proved his mastery of the form in \"Joseph Andrews\" (1742), \"The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great\" (1743) and \"The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling\" (1749), though Fielding attributed his style to an \"imitation of the manner of Cervantes, author of \"Don Quixote\"\".\n\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray is the master of the 19th Century English picaresque. Like Moll Flanders, Thackeray's best-known work, \"Vanity Fair A Novel Without a Hero\" (1847-1848) (a title ironically derived from John Bunyan's Puritan allegory of redemption \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" (1678)) follows the career of fortune-hunting adventuress Becky Sharp. His earlier novel \"The Luck of Barry Lyndon\" (1844) recounts the rise and fall of an Irish arriviste conniving his way into the 18th century English aristocracy. \n\nIn the English-speaking world, the term \"picaresque\" has referred more to a literary technique or model than to the precise genre that the Spanish call \"picaresco\". The English-language term can simply refer to an episodic recounting of the adventures of an anti-hero on the road. \n\nLaurence Sterne's \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\" (1761-1767) and \"A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy\" (1768) each have strong picaresque elements. Voltaire's French novel \"Candide\" (1759) contains elements of the picaresque. An interesting variation on the tradition of the picaresque is \"The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan\" (1824), a satirical view on early 19th-century Persia, written by a British diplomat, James Morier.\n\nElements of the picaresque novel are found in Charles Dickens’s \"The Pickwick Papers\" (1836–37). Gogol occasionally used the technique, as in \"Dead Souls\" (1842–52). Mark Twain's \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" (1884) also has some elements of the picaresque novel.\n\n\"Kvachi Kvachantiradze\" is a novel written by Mikheil Javakhishvili in 1924.This is, in brief, the story of a swindler, a Georgian Felix Krull, or perhaps a cynical Don Quixote, named Kvachi Kvachantiradze: womanizer, cheat, perpetrator of insurance fraud, bank-robber, associate of Rasputin, filmmaker, revolutionary, and pimp.\n\n\"The Twelve Chairs\" (1928) and its sequel, \"The Little Golden Calf\" (1931), by Ilya Ilf and Yevgeni Petrov became classics of the 20th century Russian satire and basis for numerous film adaptations. \n\nCamilo José Cela's \"La familia de Pascual Duarte\" (1942). The Adventures of Augie March by Saul Bellow (1953). John A. Lee's \"Shining with the Shiner\" (1944) tells amusing tales about New Zealand folk hero Ned Slattery (1840–1927) surviving by his wits and beating the Protestant work ethic', So too is Thomas Mann's \"Confessions of Felix Krull\" (1954), which like many novels emphasizes the theme of a charmingly roguish ascent in the social order. Günter Grass's \"The Tin Drum\" (1959) is a German picaresque novel.\n\nRecent examples include \"Under the Net\" (1954) by Iris Murdoch, Jerzy Kosinski's \"The Painted Bird\" (1965), Vladimir Voinovich's \"The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin\" (1969), Angela Carter's \"Nights at the Circus\" (1984), Umberto Eco's \"Baudolino\" (2000), and Aravind Adiga's \"The White Tiger\" (Booker Prize 2008).\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs was a devoted fan of picaresque novels, and gave a series of lectures involving the topic in 1979 at Naropa University in Colorado. In these he says it is impossible to separate the anti-hero from the Picaresque novel, that most of these are funny, and they all have protagonist who are outsiders by their nature. His list of picaresque novels includes Petronius' novel \"Satyricon\" (54-68 AD), \"The Unfortunate Traveller\" (1594) by Thomas Nashe, (1911), both \"A Maiden Voyage\" (1943) and \"A Voice Through a Cloud\" (1950) by Denton Welch, \"Two Serious Ladies\" (1943) by Jane Bowles, \"Death on Credit\" (1936) by Louis-Ferdinand Céline, and even himself. He also relates a series of real life newspaper stories that Burroughs himself had collected, in which people abandoned their jobs in order to save their own skin, leaving numbers of people to die. \n\nJaroslav Hašek's \"The Good Soldier Švejk\" (1923) is an example of a work from Central Europe, that has picaresque elements.\n\nJ. B. Priestley made use of the form in his \"The Good Companions\" (1929) which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12957185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12957185", "title": "Politically exposed person", "text": "Politically exposed person\n\nIn financial regulation, \"politically exposed person\" (PEP) is a term describing someone who has been entrusted with a prominent public function. A PEP generally presents a higher risk for potential involvement in bribery and corruption by virtue of their position and the influence that they may hold. The terms politically exposed person and senior foreign political figure are often used interchangeably, particularly in international forums. Foreign official is a term for individuals deemed as government persons under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA, and although definitions are similar to PEP, there are quite a few differences and should not be used interchangeably. The term PEP is typically used referring to customers in the financial services industry, while 'foreign official' refers to the risks of third party relationships in all industries.\n\nWhile there is no global definition of a PEP, most countries have based their definition on the 2003 Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) standard, as for example the Swiss financial market regulator in 2011, which quoted it as \"the international standard\" or the Australian government in 2015. \nFATF is an international inter-governmental body, founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 and hosted by the OECD, to set standards and promote implementing measures against money laundering, financing of terrorism and financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to preserve the integrity of the global financial system.\n\nIn February 2012, the FATF's latest definition of politically exposed persons (PEP), revised from 2003, is as follows: \n\nRequirements for a PEP apply to family members or close associates, any individual publicly known, or known by the financial institution to be a close personal or professional associate.\n\"The FATF definition is not intended to include middle-ranking or more junior individuals.\"\n\nA forerunner definition was by the 1997 OECD Anti-Bribery Convention aimed at reducing corruption in developing countries, which came into force February 1999; it used the term 'foreign official'.\n\nMost of the 37 FATF member countries treat domestic and foreign PEPs with heightened scrutiny. \nThe FATF guidance implies that if a person is a foreign PEP, it \"de facto\" makes them a domestic PEP in their own country. This makes sense for crime prevention, because to export proceeds of crime, the PEP must first use their own domestic financial system and thus, importance is placed on domestic, and non-foreign PEPs.\n\nUnder Australia's AML/CTF Rules, Politically exposed persons (PEPs) are individuals who occupy a prominent public position or functions in a government body or international organisation, both within and outside Australia. This definition also extends to their immediate family members and close associates.\n\nThe AML/CTF Rules define three categories of PEPs:\n\n\nA reporting entity must have procedures to identify whether any individual customer or beneficial owner is a PEP, or an associate of a PEP. The reporting entity must undertake this identification process before it provides the customer with a designated service, or as soon as practicable afterwards. A reporting entity must implement additional due diligence measures and risk management systems where the PEP is high ML/TF risk or is a foreign PEP.\n\nCanada considers all foreign PEPs to pose a money laundering and terrorist financing risk. Under the amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act that came into effect in 2016, a politically exposed person now also includes all domestic PEPs and Heads of International Organisations (HIOs). \n\nIn Chile, financial institutions are mandated to report any transaction suspicious for potential involvement in bribery by virtue of a PEP's position and the influence that they may hold. , 2,200 to 3,000 individuals are considered PEPs, 150 of them foreign, and also their second grade relatives are under financial observation by the institutions.\n\nIn South Africa, the Financial Intelligence Centre amended the Financial Intelligence Centre Act to refer to Politically Influential Persons (PIP) instead of PEP. This was done in order to include private sector officials who have business dealings with public sector officials and elected officials in the public services procurement deals.\n\n likewise the UK's PEP definition is identical to the 2003 FATF definition, i.e. without the 2012 update to include domestic PEPs; It is found in the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 Section 14(5) A politically exposed person is considered any individual who fits any of the criteria listed below:\n\nThe definition explicitly excludes middle-ranking or more junior officials.\n\nPEP status also extends to relatives and close associates. Relatives and close associates include a spouse, a partner, children and their spouses or partners and parents. Close associates include any individual who is known to have joint beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement, or any other close business relations. It also includes any individual who has sole beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement which is known to have been set up for the benefit of a person referred to in regulation.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority and Joint Money Laundering Steering Group both publish comprehensive guidance on both PEPs and other KYC related matters to assist firms in complying with their legal obligations.\n\nThe 4th EU AML Directive is expected update the definition to include domestic PEPs, and limit relatives-status to spouse and partner only, and no longer the children and parents of PEPs.\n\nThe term foreign official has been used by US enforcement agencies relating to persons who have similar characteristics as PEPs, as referenced in the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It is used in all industries, not only by financial institutions. The Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) did not use the term PEP in its regulations as of 2010. Suspicious activity requires a financial institution to submit a suspicious activity report to FinCEN. The term 'Senior Foreign Political Figure', as defined by section 312 of the USA PATRIOT Act is to a great extent similar to the definition of PEP, and also excludes middle-ranking or more junior individuals. The term PEP is recognized (and was defined) by the 'Wolfsberg Group' of eleven global banks.\n\nThe designation \"politically exposed person\" dates back to the late 1990s, in what was known as the \"Abacha Affair.\" Sani Abacha was a Nigerian dictator who organized a large scale, systematic theft of assets from the Nigerian central bank for some years with his family members and associates. It is believed that several billion dollars were stolen, and that the funds were transferred to bank accounts in the United Kingdom and Switzerland. In 2001, the Nigerian Government that succeeded the Abacha Regime made an effort to recover the money. It lodged complaints with several European agencies, including the Federal Office of Police of Switzerland which investigated close to sixty Swiss banks. In this investigation, the concept of \"politically exposed person\" emerged, around which the UN organised a committee in December 2000, that eventually led to the October 2003 resolution of United Nations Convention against Corruption, entered into force in December 2005, with ongoing annual reviews of implementation and asset recovery. It had become European Union law in 2004.\n\nPEP-specific compliance legislation addresses the link between government corruption, money laundering and terrorism financing. Since September 11, 2001, more than 100 countries have changed their laws related to financial services regulation, combating political corruption.\n\nHeavy fines have been imposed on financial institutions for conducting business with PEPs without following adequate procedures, as in the case of Riggs Bank.\n\nIn spite of regulation, political leaders like Muammar Gaddafi and Hosni Mubarak have made news in 2013 for having frozen assets in US banks that did not follow due diligence.\n\nMost financial institutions view a PEP as a potential compliance risk, and perform enhanced monitoring of accounts that fall within this category. Screening for PEPs is usually performed at the beginning of account opening, called initial due diligence or know your customer (KYC). Screening of accounts periodically is performed as part of ongoing due diligence.\n\nThere are a number of companies advertising for regulatory, financial and reputational risk screening. \n\nDue diligence to uncover PEPs can be time consuming and requires the checking of names, dates of birth, national identification numbers and photos of clients against a reputable database of known PEPs, which usually contains over one million profiles. No 'official' PEP list exist. The CIA and UN have lists of heads of states, which fall below the PEP definitions of FATF. \n\nVendors maintain their own particular database of PEPs and other high-risk customers. The world's largest PEP database of 1.6 million counterparts gives Accuity [4] part of RELX Group (formerly Reed Elsevier) [5] a strong market position. World Compliance by Lexis Nexis has a global PEP list, Lexis Diligence by Lexis Nexis, GSW Spotlight by GoldSchaff & Wolfson, World-Check by Thomson Reuters, Dow Jones offers a global PEP database, ComplyAdvantage offers an AI-driven database of PEPs and anti-money laundering data, Regulatory DataCorp offers PEP list screening, Reed Elsevier's Accuity advertises \"anti-money laundering solutions to banks and businesses worldwide\" and utilizes the WorldCompliance PEP List. \nGeneva based Polixis is seen as a challenger solution since it offers an AI-driven database of PEPs with a peculiarity that the data can be linked to a much larger set of economic data through their ARDIS software.\n\nThere are a number of crowd sourced lists of Politically Exposed Persons being made available utilizing public contributions. As of March 2016, Ukrainian activists has announced the launch of publicly available Register of Politically Exposed Persons – pep.org.ua, an exclusive public online database designed to help to withstand money laundering from state Ukrainian budget through international banks.\n\n\n"}

Its common names include Chinese plum and Japanese apricot. The flower is usually called plum blossom. This distinct tree species is related to both the plum and apricot trees. Although generally referred to as a plum in English, it is more closely related to the apricot.\nIn Chinese, Japanese and Korean cooking, the fruit of the tree is used in juices, as a flavouring for alcohol, as a pickle and in sauces. It is also used in traditional medicine.\n\nThe tree's flowering in late winter and early spring is highly regarded as a seasonal symbol.\n\n\"Prunus mume\" came from in the south of mainland China around the Yangtze River and was later introduced to Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. It can be found in sparse forests, stream sides, forested slopes along trails and mountains, sometimes at altitudes up to , and regions of cultivation.\n\n\"Prunus mume\" is a deciduous tree that starts to flower in mid-winter, typically around January until late February in East Asia. It can grow to tall. The flowers are in diameter and have a strong fragrant scent. They have colors in varying shades of white, pink, and red. The leaves appear shortly after the petals fall, are oval-shaped with a pointed tip, and are 4–8 cm long and 2.5–5 cm wide. The fruit ripens in early summer, around June and July in East Asia, and coincides with the rainy season of East Asia, the meiyu (梅雨, \"plum rain\"). The drupe is in diameter with a groove running from the stalk to the tip. The skin turns yellow, sometimes with a red blush, as it ripens, and the flesh becomes yellow. The tree is cultivated for its fruit and flowers.\n\nThe plant is known by a number of different names in English, including Chinese plum and Japanese apricot. An alternative name is \"ume\", from Japanese, or \"mume\", from the scientific name. Another alternative name is \"mei\", from the Chinese name.\n\nThe flower is known as the \"meihua\" (梅花) in Chinese, which came to be translated as \"plum blossom\" or sometimes as \"flowering plum\". The term \"winter plum\" may be used too, specifically with regard to the depiction of the flower with its early blooming in Chinese painting.\n\nIn Chinese it is called \"mei\" (梅) and the fruit is called \"meizi\" (梅子). The Japanese name is \"ume\" (kanji: 梅; hiragana: うめ), while the Korean name is \"maesil\" (hangul: 매실; hanja: 梅實). The Japanese and Korean terms derive from Middle Chinese, in which the pronunciation is thought to have been \"muəi\". The Vietnamese name is \"mai\" or \"mơ\" (although \"mai vàng\" refers to a different plant, \"Ochna integerrima\", in southern Vietnam).\n\nOrnamental tree varieties and cultivars of \"P. mume\" have been cultivated for planting in various gardens throughout East Asia, and for cut blossoming branches used in flower arrangements.\n\nIn China, there are over 300 recorded cultivars of \"Prunus mume\". These are classified by phylogenetics (\"P. mume\" and two hybrids) in branches, type of branches in groups, and characteristics of flowers in several forms:\n\n\nIn Japan, ornamental \"Prunus mume\" cultivars are classified into \"yabai\" (wild), \"hibai\" (red), and \"bungo\" (Bungo Province) types. The \"bungo\" trees are also grown for fruit and are hybrids between \"Prunus mume\" and apricot. The \"hibai\" trees have red heartwood and most of them have red flowers. The \"yabai\" trees are also used as grafting stock.\n\nIn mainland China and Taiwan, \"suanmeitang\" (; \"sour plum juice\") is made from smoked plums, called \"wumei\" (). The plum juice is extracted by boiling smoked plums in water and sweetened with sugar to make \"suanmeitang\". It ranges from light pinkish-orange to purplish black in colour and often has a smoky and slightly salty taste. It is traditionally flavoured with sweet osmanthus flowers, and is enjoyed chilled, usually in summer.\n\nIn Korea, both the flowers and the fruits are used to make tea. \"Maehwa-cha\" (; \"plum blossom tea\") is made by infusing the flowers in hot water. \"Maesil-cha\" (; \"plum tea\") is made by mixing water with \"maesil-cheong\" (plum syrup) and is served either hot or cold. In Japan, similar drink made from green plums, tastes sweet and tangy, is considered a cold, refreshing drink and is often enjoyed in the summer.\n\nA thick, sweet Chinese sauce called \"meijiang\" () or \"meizijiang\" (), usually translated as \"plum sauce\", is also made from the plums, along with other ingredients such as sugar, vinegar, salt, ginger, chili, and garlic. Similar to duck sauce, it is used as a condiment for various Chinese dishes, including poultry dishes and egg rolls.\n\nIn Korea, \"maesil-cheong\" (, \"plum syrup\"), an anti-microbial syrup made by sugaring ripe plums, is used as a condiment and sugar substitute. It can be made by simply mixing plums and sugar together, and then leaving them for about 100 days. To make syrup, the ratio of sugar to plum should be at least 1:1 to prevent fermentation, by which the liquid may turn into plum wine. The plums can be removed after 100 days, and the syrup can be consumed right away, or mature for a year or more.\n\nIn Korea, \"hwajeon\" (; \"flower pancake\") can be made with plum blossoms. Called \"maehwa-jeon\" (; \"plum blossom pancake\"), the pancake dish is usually sweet, with honey as an ingredient.\n\nPlum liquor, also known as plum wine, is popular in both Japan and Korea, and is also produced in China. \"Umeshu\" (; \"plum wine\") is a Japanese alcoholic drink made by steeping green plums in shōchū (clear liquor). It is sweet and smooth. A similar liquor in Korea, called \"maesil-ju\" (; \"plum wine\"), is marketed under various brand names, including Mae hwa soo, Matchsoon and Seoljungmae. Both the Japanese and Korean varieties of plum liquor are available with whole plum fruits contained in the bottle. In China, plum wine is called \"méijiǔ\" ().\n\nIn Taiwan, a popular 1950s innovation over the Japanese-style plum wine is the \"wumeijiu\" (; \"smoked plum liquor\"), which is made by mixing two types of plum liquor, \"meijiu\" () made of \"P. mume\" and \"lijiu\" () made of \"P. salicina\", and oolong tea liquor.\n\nIn Vietnam, ripe plums are macerated in sticky rice liquor. The resulting liquor is called \"\". A brands selling plum liquor is Sơn Tinh.\n\nIn Chinese cuisine, plums pickled with vinegar and salt are called \"suanmeizi\" (; \"sour plum fruits\"), and have an intensely sour and salty flavour. They are generally made from unripe plum fruits. \"Huamei\" () are Chinese preserved plums and refers to Chinese plums pickled in sugar, salt, and herbs. There are two general varieties: a dried variety, and a wet (pickled) variety.\n\n\"Umeboshi\" () are pickled and dried plums. They are a Japanese specialty. Pickled with coarse salt, they are quite salty and sour, and therefore eaten sparingly. They are often red in colour when purple shiso leaves are used. Plums used for making \"umeboshi\" are harvested in late May or early June, while they are still green, and layered with salt. They are weighed down with a heavy stone (or some more modern implement) until late August. They are then dried in the sun on bamboo mats for several days (they are returned to the salt at night). The flavonoid pigment in shiso leaves gives them their distinctive colour and a richer flavour. \"Umeboshi\" are generally eaten with rice as part of a bento (boxed lunch), although they may also be used in makizushi (rolled sushi). \"Umeboshi\" are also used as a popular filling for rice balls (onigiri) wrapped in laver. Makizushi made with plums may be made with either \"umeboshi\" or \"bainiku\" (\"umeboshi\" paste), often in conjunction with green shiso leaves. A byproduct of \"umeboshi\" production is \"umeboshi\" vinegar, a salty, sour condiment.\n\nA very similar variety of pickled plum, ' or ' is used in Vietnamese cuisine. The best fruit for this are from the forest around the Hương Pagoda in Hà Tây Province.\n\n\"Prunus mume\" is a common fruit in Asia and used in traditional Chinese medicine. It has long been used as a traditional drug and healthy food in East Asian countries. A recent study has indicated that \"Prunus mume\" extract is a potential candidate for developing an oral antimicrobial agent to control or prevent dental diseases associated with several oral pathogenic bacteria. Recent studies have also shown that \"Prunus mume\" extract may inhibit \"Helicobacter pylori\", associated with gastritis and gastric ulcers. Experiments on rats suggest that \"P. mume\" extract administered during endurance exercise training may enhance the oxidative capacity of exercising skeletal muscle, and may induce the muscle to prefer fatty acids for its fuel use rather than amino acids or carbohydrates, thus assisting endurance.\nPlum blossoms have been well loved and celebrated across East Asia\n\nThe plum blossom, which is known as the \"meihua\" (梅花), is one of the most beloved flowers in China and has been frequently depicted in Chinese art and poetry for centuries. The plum blossom is seen as a symbol of winter and a harbinger of spring. The blossoms are so beloved because they are viewed as blooming most vibrantly amidst the winter snow, exuding an ethereal elegance, while their fragrance is noticed to still subtly pervade the air at even the coldest times of the year. Therefore, the plum blossom came to symbolize perseverance and hope, as well as beauty, purity, and the transitoriness of life. In Confucianism, the plum blossom stands for the principles and values of virtue. More recently, it has also been used as a metaphor to symbolize revolutionary struggle since the turn of the 20th century.\n\nBecause it blossoms in the cold winter, the plum blossom is regarded as one of the \"Three Friends of Winter\", along with pine, and bamboo. The plum blossom is also regarded as one of the \"Four Gentlemen\" of flowers in Chinese art together with the orchid, chrysanthemum, and bamboo. It is one of the \"Flowers of the Four Seasons\", which consist of the orchid (spring), the lotus (summer), the chrysanthemum (autumn) and the plum blossom (winter). These groupings are seen repeatedly in the Chinese aesthetic of art, painting, literature, and garden design.\n\nAn example of the plum blossom's literary significance is found in the life and work of poet Lin Bu (林逋) of the Song dynasty (960–1279). For much of his later life, Lin Bu lived in quiet reclusion on a cottage by West Lake in Hangzhou, China. According to stories, he loved plum blossoms and cranes so much that he considered the plum blossom of Solitary Hill at West Lake as his wife and the cranes of the lake as his children, thus he could live peacefully in solitude. One of his most famous poems is \"Little Plum Blossom of Hill Garden\" (山園小梅). The original Chinese text as well as a translation follows:\n\nAs with the literary culture amongst the educated of the time, Lin Bu's poems were discussed in several Song dynasty era commentaries on poetry. Wang Junqing remarked after quoting the third and fourth line: \"\"This is from Lin Hejing's [Lin Bu's] plum blossom poem. Yet these lines might just as well be applied to the flowering apricot, peach, or pear.\"—a comparison of the flowers with the plum blossom to which the renowned Song dynasty poet Su Dongpo (蘇東坡) replied, \"Well, yes, they might. But I'm afraid the flowers of those other trees wouldn't presume to accept such praise.\"\" Plum blossoms inspired many people of the era.\n\nLegend has it that once on the 7th day of the 1st lunar month, while Princess Shouyang (壽陽公主), daughter of Emperor Wu of Liu Song (劉宋武帝), was resting under the eaves of Hanzhang Palace near the plum trees after wandering in the gardens, a plum blossom drifted down onto her fair face, leaving a floral imprint on her forehead that enhanced her beauty further. The court ladies were said to be so impressed that they started decorating their own foreheads with a small delicate plum blossom design. This is also the mythical origin of the floral fashion, \"meihua zhuang\" (梅花妝; literally \"plum blossom makeup\"), that originated in the Southern Dynasties (420–589) and became popular amongst ladies in the Tang (618–907) and Song (960–1279) dynasties. Princess Shouyang is celebrated as the goddess of the plum blossom in Chinese culture.\n\nDuring the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the garden designer Ji Cheng wrote his definitive garden architecture monograph \"Yuanye\" and in it he described the plum tree as the \"beautiful woman of the forest and moon\". The appreciation of nature at night plays an important role in Chinese gardens, for this reason there are classical pavilions for the tradition of viewing plum blossoms by the moonlight. The flowers are viewed and enjoyed by many as annual plum blossom festivals take place in the blooming seasons of the \"meihua\". The festivals take place throughout China (for example, West Lake in Hangzhou and scenic spots near Zijin Mountain in Nanjing amongst other places). Plum blossoms are often used as decoration during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) and remain popular in the miniature gardening plants of the art penjing. Branches of plum blossoms are often arranged in porcelain or ceramic vases, such as the meiping (literally \"plum vase\"). These vases can hold single branches of plum blossoms and are traditionally used to display the blossoms in a home since the early Song dynasty (960–1279).\n\nThe Moy Yat lineage of Wing Chun kung fu uses a red plum flower blossom as its symbol. The plum blossoms are featured on one of the four flowers that appear on mahjong tile sets, where \"mei\" (梅) is usually simply translated as \"plum\" in English.\n\nThe National Flower of the Republic of China (Taiwan) was officially designated as the plum blossom (\"Prunus Mei\"; ) by the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China on July 21, 1964. The plum blossom is symbol for resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity during the harsh winter. The triple grouping of stamens (three stamens per petal) on the national emblem represents Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, while the five petals symbolize the five branches of the government. It also serves as the logo of China Airlines, the national carrier of Taiwan (the Republic of China). The flower is featured on some New Taiwan dollar coins.\n\nIn Korea, the plum blossom is a symbol for spring. It is a popular flower motif, amongst other flowers, for Korean embroidery. Maebyong are plum vases derived from the Chinese meiping and are traditionally used to hold branches of plum blossoms in Korea.\n\nPlum blossoms are often mentioned in Japanese poetry as a symbol of spring. When used in haiku or renga, they are a \"kigo\" or season word for early spring. The blossoms are associated with the Japanese bush warbler and depicted together on one of the twelve suits of hanafuda (Japanese playing cards). Plum blossoms were favored during the Nara period (710–794) until the emergence of the Heian period (794–1185) in which the cherry blossoms was preferred.\n\nJapanese tradition holds that the \"ume\" functions as a protective charm against evil, so the \"ume\" is traditionally planted in the northeast of the garden, the direction from which evil is believed to come. The eating of the pickled fruit for breakfast is also supposed to stave off misfortune.\n\nIn Vietnam, due to the beauty of the tree and its flowers, the word \"mai\" is used to name girls. The largest hospital in Hanoi is named Bạch Mai (white plum blossom), another hospital in Hanoi is named Mai Hương (\"the scent of plum\"), situated in Hong Mai (pink plum blossom) street. Hoàng Mai (yellow plum blossom) is the name of a district in Hanoi. Bạch Mai is also a long and old street in Hanoi. All these places are located in the south part of Hanoi, where, in the past, many \"P. mume\" trees were grown.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33899820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33899820", "title": "Psychological effects of method acting", "text": "Psychological effects of method acting\n\nMethod acting is employed by actors to evoke realistic emotions into their performance by drawing on personal experiences. Raymond Hamden, doctor of Clinical and Forensic Psychology, defines the purpose of method acting as “compartmentalizing their own feelings while playing another character [so] they could bring the emotions of that personal feeling to cry if they needed to with that character.”\n\nHowever, when these emotions are not compartmentalized, they can encroach on other facets of life, often seeming to disrupt the actor’s psyche. This occurs as the actor delves into previous emotional experiences, be they joyful or traumatic. The psychological effects, like emotional fatigue, comes when suppressed or unresolved raw emotions are unburied to add to the character, not just from the employing personal emotions in performance. The question becomes whether the actor calls up resolved or unresolved emotions in their acting.\n\nThe psychological effects of method acting vary in intensity from individual to individual. Some common effects include; \n\nFatigue, or emotional fatigue, comes mainly when actors “create dissonance between their actions and their actual feelings.”. A mode of acting referred to as “surface acting” involves only changing one’s actions without altering the deeper thought processes. Method acting, when employed correctly, is mainly deep acting, or changing thoughts as well as actions, proven to generally avoid excessive fatigue. Surface acting is statistically “positively associated with a negative mood and this explains some of the association of surface acting with increased emotional exhaustion.” This negative mood that is created leads to fear, anxiety, feelings of shame and sleep deprivation.\n\nRaw emotion or unresolved emotions conjured up for acting, may result in a sleep deprivation and the cyclical nature of the ensuing side effects. Sleep deprivation alone can lead to impaired function, causing some individuals to “acute episodes of psychosis.” Sleep deprivation initiates chemical changes in the brain that can lead to behavior similar to psychotic individuals. These episodes can lead to more lasting psychological damage. In cases where raw emotion that has not been resolved, or traumas have been evoked before closure has been reached by the individual, the emotion can result in greater emotional instability and increased sense of anxiety, fear or shame.\n\nThe problem seen in method acting comes from the inability of actors to compartmentalize the emotions of the character from their own in daily life. Generally the actors who suffer personality changes and psychotic disorders already have some psychotic tendencies or are emotionally unstable. Those who have dissociative identity disorder “can’t recognize that the role isn’t theirs” and, even though these individuals appear normal, they have psychotic disorders that sometimes take months to identify. Dissociative identity disorder is a chemically based disorder that results from “high stress and trauma.” What these individuals experience psychologically can further detriment their chemical and physiological makeup.\n\nOne factor that is rarely discussed when observing the emotional effects of method acting is that the individuals that practice method acting may already be emotionally unstable. Dr. Hamden notes that “many actors have had a traumatic life, [and] acting gives [them] the opportunity to be someone else.” These individuals are already emotionally unstable and so the effects of method acting are more severe for them. It is only a minority of people, about 32%, that will have extreme traumatic experiences.\n\nIn the professional acting field, most companies have a psychoanalyst that consults on films to give analysis and characteristics for characters. Their responsibility lies in aiding actors in understanding how the character would act. These professionals help when actors cannot relate. Their responsibility is to draw connections and pull raw emotions from the actor to connect with the character. \n\nUnder professional supervision, method acting proves safe and effective. Many actors find the practice of method acting cathartic, similar to psychiatrist Jacob L. Moreno’s psychodrama. In this technique, a professional aids in keeping the individual in alignment while they achieve closure for traumatic emotional damage. The harmful situations in method acting arise when there is no professional supervising the process, such as in “cult-like” weekend courses provided by unqualified individuals that cannot monitor the individuals and keep them in alignment psychologically. \n\nThis would be evident in weekend courses where the instructor promises to instruct method acting to a large public class, sometimes as many as one hundred people. The instructor would then be incapable of meeting the psychological needs of each individual in the class. Harmful psychological effects arise “when control of necessary skill falls short, [and] the balance [shifts] to the negative.” This occurs “because the [psychological] risks are in fact greater than anticipated, or because unanticipated obstacles or hurdles arise.”. The acting situation then becomes threatening and results in the unpleasant feelings of fear, anxiety or shame.\n\nIt is commonly believed that there is a strong correlation between acting and the physiological reaction to acting. According to the task-emotion theory, “the positive emotions of the actor should be coupled with a specific physiological activation. In particular, excited physical reactions were expected to co-exist with task-emotions such as tension, excitement, and challenge.” . The emotion-task theory proposes that “the ‘action tendencies’ in characters occupy a special place and differ somewhat from [the] impulses in general behavior.” . However, studies have been done that show that the correlation between emotions and physical reactions are moderately weak. .\n\nThe danger comes when control precedence “manifests itself by sudden interruptions of behavior, changes in behavior or by persistence of [character’s] behavior.”. “Control precedence” by emotions is the “feelings, thoughts, impulses, actions or activation going along with aroused emotion that takes precedence over other planned or half executed thoughts, feelings, impulses, etc.” . Control precedence is the main concern for method acting. It proves a challenge for actors to come out of character after employing method acting techniques, sometimes altering their behavior, urging them to follow impulses that would be foreign to their own personal nature. This difficulty of returning to one’s own behavior is the common concern linked with method acting.\n\n"}
{"id": "8983620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8983620", "title": "Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes", "text": "Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes\n\nThe conservation-restoration of the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel was one of the most significant conservation-restorations of the 20th century.\n\nThe Sistine Chapel was built by Pope Sixtus IV within the Vatican immediately to the north of St. Peter's Basilica and completed in about 1481. Its walls were decorated by a number of Renaissance painters who were among the most highly regarded artists of late 15th century Italy, including Ghirlandaio, Perugino, and Botticelli. The Chapel was further enhanced under Pope Julius II by the painting of the ceiling by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512 and by the painting of the \"Last Judgment\", commissioned by Pope Clement VII and completed in 1541, again by Michelangelo. The tapestries on the lowest tier, today best known from the Raphael Cartoons (painted designs) of 1515–16, completed the ensemble.\n\nTogether the paintings make up the greatest pictorial scheme of the Renaissance. Individually, some of Michelangelo's paintings on the ceiling are among the most notable works of western art ever created. The frescoes of the Sistine Chapel and in particular the ceiling and accompanying lunettes by Michelangelo have been subject to a number of restorations, the most recent taking place between 1980 and 1994. This most recent restoration had a profound effect on art lovers and historians, as colours and details that had not been seen for centuries were revealed. It has been claimed that as a result \"Every book on Michelangelo will have to be rewritten\". Others, such as the art historian James Beck of ArtWatch International, have been extremely critical of the restoration, saying that the restorers have not realised the true intentions of the artist. This is the subject of continuing debate.\n\nThe frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel had a number of interventions prior to the restoration process which was started in 1980. Initial problems with the ceiling appear to have been caused by water penetrating through the floor above. In about 1547 Paolo Giovio wrote that the ceiling was being damaged by saltpetre and cracks. The effect of saltpetre is to leave a white efflorescence. Gianluigi Colalucci, Head Restorer at the Laboratory for the Restoration of Paintings for Papal Monuments, Museums and Galleries, states in his essay \"Michelangelo's colours rediscovered\", that the early conservators treated this cosmetically by an application of linseed or walnut oil which had the effect of making the crystalline deposit more transparent.\n\nIn 1625, a restoration was carried out by Simone Lagi, the \"resident gilder\", who wiped the ceiling with linen cloths and cleaned it by rubbing it with bread. He occasionally resorted to wetting the bread to remove the more stubborn accretions. His report states that the frescoes \"were returned to their previous beauty without receiving any harm\". Colalucci states that Lagi \"almost certainly\" applied layers of glue-varnish to revive the colours but does not state this in his report in the interests of \"preserving the secrets of their [the restorers'] craft\".\n\nBetween 1710 and 1713 a further restoration was carried out by the painter Annibale Mazzuoli and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke. Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The restoration concentrated on the ceiling and less attention was paid to the lunettes.\n\nThe penultimate restoration was undertaken by the Restoration Laboratory of the Vatican Museum between 1935 and 1938. The scope of the work was to consolidate some areas of the intonaco at the eastern end of the building and partially remove the soot and dirt.\n\nThe preliminary experimentation for the modern restoration began in 1979. The restoration team comprised Gianluigi Colalucci, Maurizio Rossi, Piergiorgio Bonetti, and others, who took as their guidelines the \"Rules for restoration of works of art\" as established in 1978 by Carlo Pietrangeli, director of the Vatican's Laboratory for the Restoration of Pictures, which govern the procedure and methods employed in restoration. An important part of modern restoration procedure, as established by these rules, is the study and analysis of the artwork. Part of this was the recording of every stage of the restoration process. This was done by the photographer Takashi Okamura for Nippon Television Network Corporation.\n\nBetween June 1980 and October 1984 the first stage of restoration, the work upon Michelangelo's lunettes, was achieved. The focus of the work then transferred to the ceiling, which was completed in December 1989 and from there to the Last Judgment. The restoration was unveiled by Pope John Paul II on 8 April 1994. The final stage was the restoration of the wall frescoes, approved in 1994 and unveiled on 11 December 1999.\n\nThe aims of the conservators were as follows:\n\n\nIn 1979 Colalucci undertook a series of experiments to discover the right approach for the restoration of the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. The investigation began by testing small areas of the wall fresco, \"Conflict over the Body of Moses\" by Matteo de Lecce, which had similar physical and chemical attributes to the painting techniques employed on Michelangelo's frescoes. Trials to find the right solvents were continued on a small portion of the Eleazar and Matthan lunette.\n\nBecause of the height of the ceiling and the inaccessibility of the ceiling frescoes, the precise nature of the damage and the problems that would be encountered by the restoration team could not be entirely foreseen until after the decision to restore was taken, and the scaffolding was in place. According to Colalucci, the continued scientific analysis and the response of the restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part of the process, rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every part of the building.\n\nIn 1980 the decision to undertake a total restoration was taken. Nippon Television Network Corporation of Japan provided major funding of US$4.2 million in exchange for the filming rights.\n\nThe team of restorers completed the first stage of the restoration, on the vertical surfaces and curved spandrels around the upper sections of the windows, from aluminium scaffolding projecting from just below the lunettes and using the same holes in the wall that had been made for Michelangelo's scaffold. When they moved to the ceiling, they likewise employed a system similar to Michelangelo's, which involved cantilevering a shelf outwards from the scaffolding to support a stepped and arched platform. The advantages of modern lightweight materials meant that the platform could be wheeled, facilitating easy movement along the length of the building rather than dismantling and replacement, as Michelangelo had done in 1506.\n\nThe findings of the investigation of 1979 were that the entire interior of the chapel, but particularly the ceiling, was covered with a grime of candle smoke comprising wax and soot (amorphous carbon). Above the windows (the main source of ventilation), the lunettes were particularly stained from the smoke and exhaust fumes of the city, being \"much dirtier than the ceiling proper\".\nThe building was a little unstable and had already shifted considerably prior to Michelangelo's work of 1508, causing cracking of the ceiling, the crack in the \"Judith\" pendentive being so large that it had to be filled with bricks and mortar before painting. The upper part of the ceiling provided Michelangelo an irregular surface due to cracks and water seepage.\n\nContinued ingress of water from the roof and from unroofed exterior walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.\n\nEarlier restorations had all left their marks on the frescoes. To counteract the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly the case for the lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.\n\nClose examination revealed that apart from smoky deposits, seepage deposits and structural cracks, the thin \"pictorial skin\" of Michelangelo's frescoes was in excellent condition. Colalucci describes Michelangelo as having employed the best possible fresco techniques, as described by Vasari. Most of the paint was well adhered and required little retouching. The plaster, or intonaco, on which the paintings were executed was found, for the most part, to be secure, as previous restorers had fixed it in places with bronze pins.\n\nPrior to the restoration the team spent six months investigating the composition and condition of the frescoes, questioning members of the team that had restored the frescoes in the 1930s and making a detailed scientific study to ascertain which solvents and methods were best employed upon particular painted surfaces.\n\nThe first stage of the physical restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5 mm thick) that were in danger of separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a polyvinylacetate resin. Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin.\n\nThe restorers washed the surfaces using a variety of solvents. Distilled water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. Retouching and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied in several stages for measured times, and washed with distilled water. Salt efflorescences of calcium carbonate were treated by the application of a solution of dimethylformamide. The final step was the application of a weak solution of acrylic polymer to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.\n\nWhere necessary some areas were retouched in watercolour, to integrate the pictorial material. These areas are distinctively textured with vertical brushstrokes, not visible from a distance but easily discernible as restoration work when viewed close up.\n\nCertain small areas were left unrestored, in order to maintain a physical record of the previous restorations that had taken place, for example, an area left with overpainting and candle wax, and another area demonstrating the attempt to counteract salination with oil.\n\nOnce the many layers of candle wax, varnish, and animal glue were removed from the surface of the Sistine Chapel frescoes, they became subject to dangers that could not have been predicted by previous restorers.\n\nOne of the major dangers to the frescoes is automotive exhaust, and they are also vulnerable to the effects of the crowds of tourists that pass through the chapel every day, bringing with them heat, humidity, dust and bacteria (the latter of which can biodegrade paints and pigments). The clean plaster surfaces are more in danger from these destructive elements than they were when they were covered with a layer of smoky wax.\n\nPreviously, the Sistine Chapel's only ventilation was from its windows in the upper level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown pollutants from entering, the windows are now permanently closed and an air conditioning system has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the United Technologies Corporation and was developed with the cooperation of the Vatican's Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of heat and humidity that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. The air conditioning varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level, while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. Bacteria and chemical pollutants are filtered out.\n\nEnvironmental specifications:\n\nWhen the restoration of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was James Beck, of ArtWatch International, who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of one sort or another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in \"Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.\"\n\nWhile James Beck became \"embroiled in a public debate\" with Gianluigi Colalucci, Ronald Feldman, a New York art dealer, started a petition supported by 15 well-known artists including Robert Motherwell, George Segal, Robert Rauschenberg, Christo and Andy Warhol asking Pope John Paul II to call a halt to the procedure and also the restoration of Leonardo da Vinci's \"Last Supper\".\n\nAn undertaking of the restoration team was that everything would be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of \"The New York Times\", wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of the restoration of the ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.\n\nAccording to Kimmelman, the reason for their reluctance to produce the detailed photos, which could have put to rest the worst fears of many of the interested parties, was the intention of the company to produce a large limited-edition two-volume coffee-table book (\"as large as a coffee table\"). This book, when produced retailed for US$1,000. Kimmelman refers to the fact that these photos were only made available to the few who could afford the exorbitant price as \"ungenerous\" and \"immoral\".\n\nAs the work was progressively completed, there were those who were delighted; Pope John Paul II spoke an inaugural homily after each stage. In December 1999, after the completion of the wall frescoes, he said:\n\nCardinal Edmund Szoka, governor of Vatican City, said: \"This restoration and the expertise of the restorers allows us to contemplate the paintings as if we had been given the chance of being present when they were first shown.\"\n\nOther writers were less flattering. Andrew Wordsworth of \"The Independent\", London, expressed the major point of concern:\n\nThis crucial matter was also emphasised by Beck and defined in very clearly expressed terms on the website of the artist, Peter Layne Arguimbau.\n\nThat part of the restoration in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by Michelangelo. The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, the work on the ceiling proceeded and, according to critics such as James Beck, their worst fears were confirmed once the ceiling was completed.\n\nThe cause for dissent lies in the analysis and understanding of the techniques utilised by Michelangelo, and the technical response of the restorers to their understanding of those techniques. A close examination of the frescoes of the lunettes convinced the restorers that Michelangelo worked exclusively in \"buon fresco\"; that is, the artist worked only on freshly laid plaster and each section of work was completed while the plaster was still in its fresh state. In other words, Michelangelo did not work \"a secco\"; he did not come back later and add details onto the dry plaster.\n\nThe restorers, by assuming that the artist took a universal approach to the painting, took a universal approach to the restoration. A decision was made that all of the shadowy layer of animal glue and \"lamp black\", all of the wax, and all of the overpainted areas were contamination of one sort or another: smoke deposits, earlier restoration attempts and painted definition by later restorers in attempt to enliven the appearance of the work. Based on this decision, according to Arguimbau's critical reading of the restoration data that has been provided, the chemists of the restoration team decided upon a solvent that would effectively strip the ceiling down to its paint-impregnated plaster. After treatment, only that which was painted \"buon fresco\" would remain.\n\nAccording to critics, the inherent problem with this approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted \"buon fresco\", that he was always satisfied with the result at the end of the day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.\n\nA summary of the relevant statements of Colalucci, in the order that they occur in the Appendix entitled \"Michelangelo's colours uncovered\" is as follows:\n\nThe ongoing criticism has been that the restorers presumed to know what end result the master was seeking to achieve in every separate case across the ceiling, and by what method he sought to achieve it. The disagreements about this have been vociferous and are unresolved.\n\nThe restorers took for granted that all of the layers of grease and soot on the ceiling were the result of candle smoke. Contrary to this view, James Beck and numerous artists have suggested that Michelangelo used carbon black in a wash of glue to lay on shadows and crisp dark definition, \"a secco\". If this is the case, then the greater part was removed in the restoration.\n\nOn some of the figures, however, there still remains clear evidence of painting in carbon black. The apparent explanation for this is that over the long period that Michelangelo was at work, he probably, for a variety of reasons, varied his technique. Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular \"giornata\" include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.\n\nThere are still intense areas of shadow which throw the Cumaean Sibyl into relief. But it is more than relief; it is the three-dimensionality which art-lovers expect to see in the work of the man who sculpted Moses. Critics of the restoration claim that this was Michelangelo's aim and that many frescoes had brightly contrasting colours laid side-by-side that were then worked over \"a secco\" to achieve this effect and that this is what has been lost by a too-scrupulous cleaning.\n\nConsistently missing from the restored ceiling is the crisp \"a secco\" detailing of the architecture: the scallop shells, acorns and \"bead and reel\" ornament which Michelangelo possibly would have left for completion by an assistant, when he moved on to the next panel. The treatment of these details varied considerably. In a few places, around the Ezekias spandrel, for example, the architectural detailing was painted \"buon fresco\" and remains intact.\nA comparison of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The one on the left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.\n\nOn the corner pendentives, each of which depicts a violent subject, the removal of the carbon black has diminished the dramatic intensity of all four scenes. This is particularly noticeable in the loss of depth in the \"Punishment of Haman\". Where once the figure projected starkly against the darkly shadowed interior, now foreshortening, definition and drama is lost in the pastel monotone that remains.\n\nThe curator, Fabrizio Mancinelli, quotes the 18th-century French traveller De Lalande in saying that the colouring of the ceiling was, by that time, monotonous, \"tend[ing] towards dull red and grey\". Mancinelli writes that the restoration reveals \"a new Michelangelo\" as a colourist and that this \"new character makes much better sense of his historical position\". He goes on to say that perceptive viewers of the Sistine Chapel ceiling have always been aware that the range of colours used was very different from that which could be seen, and included the same pinks, apple greens, oranges, yellows and pale blues that were employed by Michelangelo's teacher, Domenico Ghirlandaio, one of the most competent fresco painters of the Renaissance.\n\nThe brilliant palette ought to have been expected by the restorers as the same range of colours appears in the works of Giotto, Masaccio and Masolino, Fra Angelico and Piero della Francesca, as well as Ghirlandaio himself and later fresco painters such as Annibale Carracci and Tiepolo. The reason for employing this range of colours is that many other pigments are not usable in fresco as they have chemical properties that react badly in interaction with wet plaster. The colour that is noticeably missing from Michelangelo's ceiling, but not \"The Last Judgment\", is the intense blue of lapis lazuli. This colour, achieved by grinding semi-precious stone, was always applied as a secondary, \"a secco\" stage, along with the gold leaf applied as haloes and decoration to robes.\n\nThe aspect of the colouring which was most unexpected was Michelangelo's treatment of shadows. The painting of the Libyan Sibyl and the Prophet Daniel, which are side-by-side, are exemplary. On the yellow dress of the Sibyl, Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights, passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange, darker orange and almost to red in the shadows. While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco, the gradation through adjacent parts of the spectrum is a natural enough solution. On Daniel's robes, there is no such gentle gradation. The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green in the shadows, while the mauve has shadows that are intensely red. These colour combinations, which are best described as iridescent, can be found at various places on the ceiling, including the hose of the young man in the \"Mathan\" lunette which is pale green and reddish purple.\n\nIn some instances, the colour combinations look garish: this is particularly the case with the Prophet Daniel. A comparison of the \"restored\" and \"unrestored\" figure gives strong evidence that Michelangelo worked over this figure in a wash of carbon black, and that the technique was preplanned. The bright red used on the robes of Daniel and the Libyan Sibyl does not, on its own, create effective shadows. In these and many other cases it appears to have been intended as underpainting, to be seen only through a thin black wash and with the deepest shadows picked out in more intense black, as they still are on the Cumaean Sibyl. This use of bright, contrasting colours as underpainting is not a common feature of frescoes, but it is commonly employed in both oil painting and tempera. Like Daniel, the Libyan Sibyl's yellow garment once had much more subtlety in its folds and shadows than it has now.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt that before the restoration, the whole ceiling was dirtier, more muted and more monochrome than Michelangelo ever intended, but when images of the frescoes are viewed in their stained and unrestored state the subtle washes and intense definitions, described by Beck and Arguimbau, still make their presence known, giving mass and bulk to the forms.\n\nThe painter and biographer Giorgio Vasari, in his \"Lives of the Artists\", describes the figure of Jonah as it appeared in the mid-16th century:\nThe large figure of Jonah is of great significance to the total composition, both pictorially and theologically, being symbolic of the Risen Christ. The figure occupies the pendentive which rises from the altar wall to support the vault, and strains backward, his eyes turned towards God. The foreshortening described by Vasari was innovative and highly influential to later painters. The cleaning of this significant figure has left a few remnants of black shadow visible to the extreme left side of the painting. All the other, less intense, black lines and washes have been removed, lessening the impact of the radical foreshortening, and also robbing the great fish, the genii behind Jonah, and the architectural figures of much detail.\n\nThe missing depth is not the only factor that the critics deplore. An important feature of Michelangelo's work which, in many places, has disappeared forever is the painting of the eyeballs. Eyes appear in many instances to have been painted \"buon fresco\". Wherever they have not been painted buon fresco but added \"a secco\", they have been removed by the restorers.\n\nThey are an essential part of the most impressive and famous of the frescoes, the \"Creation of Adam\". Adam gazes at God. God looks directly at Adam. And under God's protective arm, Eve turns her eyes sideways in a look of admiration for her husband-to-be. Again and again, Michelangelo painted telling gazes into the faces of his characters. The eye sockets of the family in the Zorobabel lunette are empty as are the eyes of the man in the Aminadab lunette, but the removal that has caused the most distress to the critics are the eyes of the little figure in green and white who once looked out of the gloom above the lunette of Jesse.\n\nArguimbau says:\n\nRichard Serrin, in an essay entitled \"Lies and Misdemeanors: Gianluigi Colalucci's Sistine Chapel Revisited\" says:\n\nCarlo Pietrangeli, former Director General of the Vatican Museums, writes of the restoration: \"It is like opening a window in a dark room and seeing it flooded with light.\" His words resonate with those of Giorgio Vasari who, in the 16th century, said of the Sistine Chapel ceiling:\n\nPietrangeli, in his foreword to \"The Sistine Chapel\", written after the restoration of the lunettes, but prior to the restoration of the ceiling, commends those who had the courage to commence the restoration process, and thanks not only those who visited the restoration while it was in progress and gave the benefit of their knowledge and experience, but also those who were critical of the enterprise. Pietrangeli made acknowledgement that these people spurred the team on to punctilious documentation so that a full report of criteria and methods should be available to those who are interested, both in the present and the future.\n\n"}
{"id": "383343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=383343", "title": "Robert the Devil", "text": "Robert the Devil\n\nRobert the Devil () is a legend of medieval origin about a Norman knight who discovers he is the son of Satan. His mother, despairing of heaven's aid in order to obtain a son, had asked for help from the devil. Robert's satanic instincts propel him into a violent and sinful life, but he eventually overcomes them to achieve repentance.\n\nIt is not known whether or not the legend is based on the life of a real individual. It originated in France in the 13th century and has since provided the basis for many literary and dramatic works, most notably the Meyerbeer opera \"Robert le diable\".\n\nThe 19th century Italian writer Arturo Graf gives this version of the legend in his 1889 book \"Il Diavolo\" : There was once a duchess of Normandy who was tormented with a desire to have children and yet could have none. Weary of recommending herself to God, who will not listen to her, she betakes herself to the Devil, and her wish is speedily satisfied. A son is born to her, a veritable firebrand. As an infant, he bites his nurse and tears out her hair; as a lad, he knifes his teachers; at the age of twenty, he becomes a bandit chief. He is dubbed knight, in the belief that thus the wicked instincts raging within him may be overcome; but thereafter he is worse than he was before. No one surpasses him in strength or in courage. In a tourney he overthrows and slays thirty opponents; then he goes roaming about the world; then he returns to his native land, and begins once more to play the bandit, robbing, burning, murdering, ravishing. One day, after cutting the throats of all the nuns of a certain abbey, he remembers his mother and goes in search of her. Soon as they spy him, the servants take to their heels, scattering in all directions; not one tarries to ask him whence he comes or what he desires. Then, for the first time in his life, Robert is astounded at the horror which he inspires in his fellow-beings; for the first time, he becomes conscious of his own monstrous wickedness, and he feels how his heart is pierced by the sharp tooth of remorse. But why is he wickeder than other men? Why was he born thus? Who made him what he is? An ardent longing seizes him to unravel this mystery. He hastens to his mother, and with drawn sword he adjures her to unveil to him the secret of his birth. Learning this, he becomes frantic with terror, shame, and grief. But his sturdy nature is not weakened; he does not yield to despair; instead, the hope of a laborious redemption, of a marvelous victory, urges and spurs on his proud spirit. He will learn to conquer Hell, to subdue himself, to thwart the designs of that accursed fiend who created him to serve his own ends, who has made of him a docile instrument of destruction and of sin. And he makes no delay. He goes to Rome, casts himself at the feet of the pope, makes confession to a holy hermit, submits himself to the harshest kind of penance, and swears that henceforth he will taste no food that he has not first wrested from the jaws of a dog. On two separate occasions, when Rome was besieged by the Saracens, he fights incognito for the Emperor and gains the victory for the Christians. Recognized at last, he refuses all rewards and honors, the imperial crown, even the monarch's own daughter, goes away to dwell with his hermit in the wilderness, and dies a saint, blessed by both God and men. In other accounts, he finally weds the beautiful princess who is deeply in love with him.\n\nThe oldest known account of this legend is a Latin prose narrative by a Dominican friar, Etienne de Bourbon (c. 1250), in which no information on Robert's family is given. Then it appears in a French metrical romance of the thirteenth century, in which Robert is described as the son of the duchess of Normandy. An English translation by Samuel N. Rosenberg of the thirteenth-century French romance was published in 2018 by Penn State University Press. It appears also in a \"dit\" of somewhat later date, and in a miracle play of the fourteenth century. A French prose version was also prefixed to the old \"Croniques de Normandie\" (probably of the thirteenth century). But the legend owes its popularity to the story-books, of which the earliest known appeared at Lyons in 1496, and again at Paris in 1497, under the title \"La Vie du terrible Robert le dyable\". Since the sixteenth century the legend was often printed together with that of Richard sans Peur (Richard I, Duke of Normandy); it was published in completely recast form in 1769 under the title \"Histoire de Robert le Diable, duc de Normandie, et de Richard Sans Peur, son fils\".\n\nFrom France the legend spread to Spain, where it was very popular. In England, the subject was treated in the metrical romance, \"Sir Gowther\", probably written around the end of the fourteenth century (though in this version the devil disguises himself as the mother's husband). An English translation from the French chapbook was made by Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's assistant, and published without date under the title \"Robert deuyll\". Another version, not based on the preceding, was written by Thomas Lodge in his book on \"Robin the Divell\", in which Robert is the \"second Duke of Normandy\" (London, 1591). In the Netherlands, the romance of \"Robrecht den Duyvel\" was put on the index of forbidden books by the Bishop of Antwerp in 1621.\n\nIn Germany, the legend never attained much of a vogue; not until the nineteenth century did it pass into the \"Volksbücher\", being introduced by Görres. It was treated in epic form by (1854), in dramatic form by Raupach (1835) and in comic travesty (after the 1831 Meyerbeer opera \"Robert le diable\") by W. S. Gilbert in 1868.\n\nThe villain in Erich Kästner's 1931 children's story \"Pünktchen und Anton\", a petty criminal and thief, is rather facetiously nicknamed \"Robert the Devil\".\n\nVarious attempts have been made to identify Robert with a historical individual, generally a Norman aristocrat of the 11th century. F. J. Furnivall, following earlier writers, argued that Robert I, Duke of Normandy was the source of the story, writing that, \"The original of Robert the Devil was Robert, father of William the Conqueror, and sixth Duke of Normandy. Part of the legends about him have been transferred to a different person, Robert, King of Sicily (and Jerusalem), Duke of Apulia etc., who tried to make peace between Edward III and the French king, and whom Froissart and others tell us of.\"\n\nOther scholars have dismissed this. Charles Homer Haskins says that it is nothing more than \"an unwarranted confusion with this hero, or rather villain, of romance and grand opera\". Another Norman aristocrat, Robert of Bellême, has also been suggested as the original. According to William Hunt in the Dictionary of National Biography, various stories of his sadistic cruelty were circulated after his death. In Maine \"his abiding works are pointed to as the works of Robert the Devil, a surname that has been transferred from him to the father of the Conqueror.\"\n\nA Norman castle near Rouen, known as Château de Robert-le-Diable, is associated with the legend. The Elizabethan statesman Robert Cecil was called \"Robert the devil\" by his enemies, but this was with reference to the existing legend.\n"}

It focuses on mysterious images seen in developed pictures. The film was a huge box office success, making it one of the best horror movies of Thailand recognized worldwide. \n\nAn English-language remake under the same title was released in 2008.The film was also remade in Hindi as Click.\n\nAfter celebrating at a drinking party with his close friends, Tun (Ananda Everingham), a photographer, and his girlfriend Jane (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee), get into a car accident. Jane runs over a young woman that she didn't see. With much fear, Tun prohibits her from getting out of the car: they drive away, leaving the girl lying on the road.\n\nTun begins to discover mysterious white shadows and what appear to be faces in his photographs. A suspicious Jane thinks these images may be the ghost of the girl they hit on the road. Tun, who has been experiencing severe neck pains since the accident, visits a specialist and is dismayed to find that his weight is double his regular weight. Unconvinced of the existence of the supernatural, Tun dismisses the idea of being haunted although his friends are also being disturbed by this mysterious girl.\n\nJane discovers that the girl was Natre (Achita Sikamana), a shy young woman who had attended the same college as Tun. After confronting Tun, Tun admits that he and Natre were in a relationship, which Tun had kept secret from his friends. Natre loved Tun dearly and threatened to commit suicide when Tun abruptly broke off the relationship. Tun witnesses his friend, Tonn, committing suicide, and discovers that his two other close friends from college have also committed suicide. Believing that they have been coerced into doing so by Natre's ghost, Tun becomes convinced that he will be next.\n\nThe haunting of Tun by Natre's ghost escalates, so he and Jane visit Natre's mother. At her house, they discover the decaying body of Natre in her bedroom. They learn that Natre had committed suicide, but her mother could not bear to have her cremated. Natre's funeral is held the following day, after which Jane hopes that everything will return to normal. Tun and Jane spend the night in a hotel, where Tun wakes up and is confronted by Natre's ghost. Tun tries to escape but is pursued; ultimately, while trying to get away, he falls off a fire escape and is injured.\n\nHowever, on returning to Bangkok, Jane collects some photographs. One of the films shows a series of images of Natre crawling towards the bookcase in Tun's apartment. Jane finds a set of negatives hidden behind the bookcase. She develops the negatives to find photographs in which Tun's friends—the ones who committed suicide—are sexually assaulting Natre. Utterly disgusted by her findings and now convinced that Natre tried to warn her, a teary Jane confronts Tun. Tun admits that he witnessed the rape but did nothing to stop his friends, and that he was the one who had taken those photos. He says he did it out of peer pressure and has never forgiven himself, but Jane leaves him.\n\nKnowing that he is still haunted by Natre, Tun begins taking pictures of every room in his house, but does not see Natre in any of the photos. He throws the camera across the room in a rage, only for it to go off, taking a photograph of Tun, revealing Natre sitting on Tun's shoulders. In the ensuing confrontation, Natre covers Tun's eyes making him unable to see, making him lose balance and fall out of the window.\n\nThe final scene shows a badly bandaged Tun slumping over in a hospital bed while Jane visits him. As the door swings closed behind Jane, the glass reflection shows Natre still sitting on his shoulders.\n\nBased on 25 reviews, it holds a 56% \"rotten\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe film opened at #1 at the Thai box office grossing $867,800 and remained at the top in its second weekend grossing $607,300. The film grossed a total of $2,584,600 in Thailand becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of the year.\n\nThe film was nominated for the 2005 Golden Kinnaree Award for best film at the Bangkok International Film Festival and has won various awards at smaller festivals around the world. The movie was especially well received in Thailand and Singapore.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39184456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39184456", "title": "Tales of Xillia", "text": "Tales of Xillia\n\n\"Tales of Xillia\"s reception in Japan was highly positive. At the time of its release, it was the most preordered \"Tales\" game in the series and sold half a million copies in a week; the game also won awards from Sony and \"Famitsu\". The English localization received positive reception for its battle system, neutral to positive reviews for its plot and characters, and criticism for the map designs. The sequel, \"Tales of Xillia 2\", was released in November 2012 in Japan and in August 2014 in North America and PAL region.\n\n\"Tales of Xillia\" consists primarily of two major areas: the field map and the battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment where the player character traverses and interacts with non-player characters, items, or mob avatars. On the field map, character interactions between the party can also be viewed in the form of a sketch story; these sketch stories are referred to as skits and consist of animated portraits and voice acting. When coming into contact with a mob avatar, the environment switches to the battle screen, a 3D representation of an area in which the player commands the characters in battles against the CPU-controlled mobs.\nDuring battle sequences, the game uses the \"Dual Raid Linear Motion Battle System\", a variation of the \"Linear Motion Battle\" used in the \"Tales\" series. Four characters from the party are chosen to battle and characters not controlled by a player are controlled by artificial intelligence with instructions set by the players beforehand. The enemy mob's number, appearances, behavior, vary and are dependent on the mob's avatar. Both sides' objective is to deplete the other side's health points (HP) using attacks and skills. When a party member's health falls to zero, the party member faints until revived with items, by a healer, or resting at an inn on the field map; Mobs with zero HP disappear from the arena. Killing all the mobs will yield experience points, items, and allows the player to return to the field map. If all four participating party members are defeated, a game over will occur. Skill and attribute development is based on a system of orbs placed on the nodes of a hexagonal web called the Lilium Orb. When characters level up, they receive GP which can then be allocated to the orbs on the web in a uni-linear path. Each orb activated contains either a new skill or an attribute upgrade.\n\nBattles take place in real-time. Player actions include moving, dashing, standard attacks, and artes; artes are special attacks which consume \"Technical Points\" (TP), the in-game synonym for magic points. Dashing, standard attacks, and artes usage are also restricted by the \"Assault Counter\" (AC), a synonym for action points. Party members are able to link to each other to perform unified attacks called linked artes. While linked, the supporting partner provides unique abilities to the character, while also increasing the Linked Artes Gauge. When the Linked Artes Gauge is full, the player character can enter Over Limit which gives them immunity to stagger, unlimited AC, and allows them to use linked artes in succession.\n\nTwo millennia ago, humans developed spyrix, a power source which absorbs spirits to supply power. In response, the spirit Maxwell gathered humans, who share a symbiotic relationship with spirits, onto an isolated land protected by a barrier; the isolated land became known as Rieze Maxia and the outer lands as Elympios. As spirits are needed to sustain nature, Maxwell waits for the day all humans on Elympios die off before dispelling the barrier. Twenty years prior to the present, an Elympion cruise ship becomes trapped in Rieze Maxia, eventually forming a terrorist group known as Exodus. Exodus works with the Elympios military to find a way to destroy the barrier. In the present era, Rieze Maxia is ruled by two countries called Rashugal and Auj Oule. While the two countries appear to live in harmony, they both initiate black operations in attempts to conquer the other in hopes of uniting Rieze Maxia as a single country.\n\nIn the present, medical student Jude Mathis investigates a military research facility in order to search for his missing professor. There he witnesses a spyrix-powered weapon called the Lance of Kresnik absorb his professor. The military prep Jude as the next victim, but he is saved by Milla Maxwell, Maxwell's successor. In response, the military activates the lance which absorbs Milla's spirit companions forcing her and Jude to retreat. Jude and Milla decide to confront Rashugal's king who had endorsed the Lance's creation. During their travel, they are joined by Alvin, Elize Lutus, Rowen J. Illbert and Leia Rolando. After Rashugal's king is defeated, Exodus obtains and uses the Lance to temporarily disable the barrier protecting Rieze Maxia, allowing Elympios' army to invade. Assisted by Auj Oule's king, Gaius, the party defeats Exodus at the cost of Milla's life.\n\nAfter mourning her death, Jude leads the party to meet Maxwell and attempts to persuade him to dispel the barrier and save Elympios. Reunited with Milla, who has been reborn as a spirit, they convince Maxwell of their cause. However, Gaius and the spirit named Muzét seal Maxwell within the Lance of Kresnik, intent on sustaining the barrier until all spyrixs are destroyed; Maxwell sends the party to Elympios before he is completely subdued. There, the party learns about Elympios' dependence on spyrix and an ongoing research on spyrite, a power source harmless to spirits. With renewed conviction, the party confronts and defeats Gaius and Muzét. Maxwell dispels the barrier and disperses its energy to temporarily power spyrixes until the completion of spyrites. The party returns to their daily lives with Jude joining a spyrite research team, Milla resuming her role as Maxwell, and Gaius uniting Rieze Maxia under his rule.\n\nThe game began development after \"Tales of Hearts\" was completed. A \"Tales\" game for the PlayStation 3 was announced in July 28, 2010's \"Weekly Shonen Jump\" and officially announced by Namco Bandai Games on August 2, 2010; On December 15, 2010 \"Tales of Xillia\" was unveiled in \"Weekly Shonen Jump\" and its official website was launched. Its staff, battle system and two main characters were revealed along with the game's main theme, . Between January and March 2011, Namco released information about the other four playable characters. In May the game's release date, a \"Xillia\" themed PS3, and the game's theme song, \"Progress\" by Ayumi Hamasaki were revealed. Before the game's release, a Korean game guide of the game was leaked onto the internet forcing Namco to issue a response. Due to time constraints, some planned features were excluded such as an onsen scene and having Gaius or Muzét as playable characters. The game was released on September 8, 2011 and was made available on the Japanese PlayStation Store a year later. The game was re-released under PlayStation 3 The Best label on October 9, 2014.\n\nIn March 2012, \"Tales of Xillia\" was trademarked in Europe and North America. A Western localization was officially announced by Namco Bandai Games Europe on July 6, 2012 through Twitter. On November 5, 2012 Ted Tsung, the North American producer for \"Tales of Xillia\", announced the completion of the English voice recordings. On the same day, Europe's localization was announced to have subtitles in English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian. In April 2013, Namco announced the game would be released in August for North America and PAL region; also announced was the collector's edition of the game. In North America, the first print of the game were released as a limited edition bundle. The game was translated by 8-4 and dubbed by Cup of Tea Productions.\n\n\"Tales of Xillia\" had several downloadable content (DLC) which changed a character's appearance or provided in-game bonuses such as items, currency, or levels. The majority of the DLC were released weekly between September 8 till October 6, 2011 on the PlayStation Store.

All English reviewers agreed the battle system was fast and engaging; however, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", Game Informer, GameSpot, and \"PlayStation Official Magazine\" panned the map designs calling them repetitive, lifeless and bland. The plot received neutral to positive reception. Game Revolution wrote \"There's a pleasing inertia to the way plotlines form, unfold, and reach a conclusion that propels our heroes ever-forward, never stopping long enough to feel meandering but never feeling rushed or forced either.\", praising the narrative to be one of the qualities to the game. Game Informer described the plot as \"investing\" and liked the balance in tragic and lighthearted moments. Joystiq lauded the execution of the plot for avoiding the usual JRPG \"info dumps\" and how small plot-lines intertwined into a larger conflict. \"PlayStation Official Magazine\" considered the plot as average and called it a let-down compared to the combat system. Reviewers have also noted the dual-protagonist execution caused incoherency in Milla's story.\n\nReviewers had mixed opinions on the characters. Generally, reviewers liked the character interactions. IGN praised the diverse characters but panned Milla's english voice acting. Game Revolution felt the characters were relatable and agreed with IGN about Milla's voice noting it sounded robotic and forced. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" described the characters as rather normal and competent compared to the previous \"Tales\" games, adding that they could imagine the cast having lives and dreams outside of the party's journey. \"Edge\" described the character interactions as engaging, well written, and praised how the characters avoided the cliché found in manga and anime. Oppositely, \"PlayStation Official Magazine\" felt the characters \"fall into the familiar anime archtypes\" and that \"flat voice acting and a melodramatic script\" made it difficult to feel invested in the cast; Polygon agreed about the character archetypes and called it a lazy strategy used to make the characters understandable.\n\n"}
{"id": "839263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=839263", "title": "The Good Soldier", "text": "The Good Soldier\n\nThe Good Soldier: A Tale of Passion is a 1915 novel by English novelist Ford Madox Ford. It is set just before World War I and chronicles the tragedy of Edward Ashburnham, the soldier to whom the title refers, and his own seemingly perfect marriage and that of two American friends. The novel is told using a series of flashbacks in non-chronological order, a literary technique that formed part of Ford's pioneering view of literary impressionism. Ford employs the device of the unreliable narrator to great effect as the main character gradually reveals a version of events that is quite different from what the introduction leads the reader to believe. The novel was loosely based on two incidents of adultery and on Ford's messy personal life.\n\nThe novel's original title was \"The Saddest Story\", but after the onset of World War I, the publishers asked Ford for a new title. Ford suggested (sarcastically) \"The Good Soldier\", and the name stuck.\n\nIn 1998, the Modern Library ranked \"The Good Soldier\" 30th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2015, the BBC ranked \"The Good Soldier\" 13th on its list of the 100 greatest British novels.\n\n\"The Good Soldier\" is narrated by the character John Dowell, half of one of the couples whose dissolving relationships form the subject of the novel. Dowell tells the story of those dissolutions and the deaths of three characters and the madness of a fourth, in a rambling, non-chronological fashion. As an unreliable narrator, the reader can consider whether they believe Dowell and his description of how the events unfolded, including his own role in the \"saddest story ever told\".\n\nThe novel opens with the famous line, \"This is the saddest story I have ever heard.\" Dowell explains that, for nine years, he, his wife Florence, and their friends Captain Edward Ashburnham (the \"good soldier\" of the book's title) and his wife Leonora had an ostensibly normal friendship while Edward and Florence sought treatment for their heart ailments at a spa in Nauheim, Germany.\n\nAs it turns out, nothing in the relationships or in the characters is as it first seems. Florence's heart ailment is a fiction she perpetrated on John to ensure that he did not seek intimacy from her as it would seemingly be too stressful for her heart, and to keep him out of her bedroom at night so that she could continue her affair with a French artist named Jimmy. Edward and Leonora have an imbalanced marriage broken by his constant infidelities (both of body and heart) and Leonora's attempts to control Edward's affairs (both financial and romantic). Dowell is an innocent and is coming to realise how much he has been fooled, as Florence and Edward had an affair under his nose for nine years without John knowing until Florence was dead.\n\nDowell tells the story of Edward and Leonora's relationship, which appears normal to others but which is a power struggle that Leonora wins. Dowell narrates several of Edward's affairs and peccadilloes, including his possibly innocent attempt to comfort a crying servant on a train; his affair with the married Maisie Maidan, the one character in the book whose heart problem was unquestionably real, and his bizarre tryst in Monte Carlo and Antibes with a kept woman known as La Dolciquita. Edward's philandering ends up costing them a fortune in bribes, blackmail and gifts for his lovers, leading Leonora to take control of Edward's financial affairs. She gradually gets him out of debt.\n\nFlorence's affair with Edward leads her to commit suicide when she realises both that Edward is falling in love with his and Leonora's young ward, Nancy Rufford, and that Dowell has found out about her affair with Jimmy. Florence sees Edward and Nancy in an intimate conversation and rushes back to the resort, where she sees John talking to a man she used to know (and who knows of her affair with Jimmy). Assuming that her relationship with Edward and her marriage to John are over, Florence takes prussic acid—which she has carried for years in a vial that John thought held her heart medicine—and dies.\n\nEdward's last affair is his most scandalous, as he becomes infatuated with Nancy. Nancy came to live with them after leaving a convent where her parents had sent her; her mother was a violent alcoholic, and her father (it is later suggested that this man may not be Nancy's biological father) may have abused her. Edward, tearing himself apart because he does not want to spoil Nancy's innocence, arranges to have her sent to India to live with her father, even though this frightens her terribly. Once Leonora knows that Edward intends to keep his passion for Nancy chaste, but only wants Nancy to continue to love him from afar, she torments him by making this wish impossible. She pretends to offer to divorce him so he can marry Nancy, but informs Nancy of his sordid sexual history, destroying Nancy's innocent love for him. After Nancy's departure, Edward receives a telegram from her that reads, \"Safe Brindisi. Having a rattling good time. Nancy.\" He asks Dowell to take the telegram to his wife, pulls out his pen knife, says that it's time he had some rest and slits his own throat. When Nancy reaches Aden and sees the obituary in the paper, she becomes catatonic.\n\nThe novel's last section has Dowell writing from Edward's old estate in England, where he takes care of Nancy, whom he cannot marry because of her mental illness. Nancy is only capable of repeating two things—a Latin phrase meaning \"I believe in an omnipotent God\" and the word \"shuttlecocks.\" Dowell states that the story is sad because no one got what they wanted. Leonora wanted Edward but lost him and ended in marrying the normal (but dull) Rodney Bayham. Edward wanted Nancy but gave her up, then lost her. Dowell wanted a wife but ended up a nurse to two women.\n\nDowell ends up generally unsure about where to lay the blame but expressing sympathy for Edward, because he believes himself similar to Edward in nature. The fact is he has been disengaged, a voyeur. While the other characters are flawed, he has never participated in life and is revealed as less than the foolish innocent he represents himself as when he walks way leaving Edward to slit his throat with a very small pen knife.\n\nThe novel has potential narrative inconsistencies that suggest different, hidden plot elements. For example, Dowell marries an heiress who ostensibly has a bad heart. He states repeatedly that he has no need or interest in her money—one might argue that he protests his lack of interest rather too much. Florence eventually dies, stated by Dowell to be suicide. If readers suspend their trust in the narrator, some may be left with the impression that the narrator is obfuscating, happy his wife dies and not doing anything to prevent it; just as he does little throughout the entire book. Thus, behind the more or less explicit narrative lurks a possible counter-narrative in which Dowell is something of a sociopath, caring for no one but himself, an observer of others who are living more fully while never actively engaging very intensely in life himself, and indeed, perhaps a voyeur relishing the demise of others. This would be the story of a manipulative man trying to elicit the sympathy of the audience he speaks/writes to, which must decide whether he is a deluded victim or a heartless manipulator of the reader's emotions.\n\nFlorence supposedly poisons herself in a possibly painful manner, and Edward supposedly cuts his own throat, but as always in this novel, we only have Dowell's word for it, and he epitomises the \"unreliable narrator.\" The reader must decide just how much of the truth Dowell reveals. Some commentators have even suggested that Dowell, who presents himself as considered by all to be passive, murders both Florence and Edward. In this view the entire story is his justification for doing so without his admitting his guilt.\n\nJohn Dowell: The narrator, husband to Florence. Dowell is an American Quaker, either a gullible and passionless man who cannot read the emotions of the people around him or a master manipulator who plays the victim.\n\nFlorence Dowell: John Dowell's wife and a scheming, manipulative, unfaithful woman who uses Dowell for his money while pursuing her affairs on the side. She fakes a heart ailment to get what she wants out of her husband and has a lengthy affair with Edward Ashburnham.\n\nEdward Ashburnham: Friend of the Dowells and husband of Leonora. Ashburnham is a hopeless romantic who keeps falling in love with the women he meets; he is at Nauheim for the treatment of a heart problem, but the ailment is not real, he used it as an excuse to follow a female heart patient to Nauheim. He is Dowell's opposite, a virile, physical, passionate man.\n\nLeonora Ashburnham: Edward's wife by a marriage that was more or less arranged by their fathers. Leonora comes to resent Edward's philandering as much for its effect on her life as on her marriage and asserts more and more control over Edward until he dies.\n\nNancy Rufford: The young ward of the Ashburnhams; Edward falls in love with Nancy after he tires of Florence. Eventually, Edward arranges for Nancy to be sent to India to live with her father, but she goes mad en route when she learns of Edward's death.\n\nLa Dolciquita: A Spanish dancer (The Grand Duke's mistress) who is Edward's first sexual affair. Although he believes himself to be romantically attached to her, he quickly becomes disillusioned by her thirst for his money. \n\nMaisie Maidan: A young, pretty, married woman with whom Edward fell in love. Leonora pays for her treatment for a weak heart at Nauheim, knowing that Edward would follow her there. Maisie's heart gives way after she hears Florence and Edward talking about her disparagingly and she dies.\n\nHow well can we judge the characterisations the novel when Dowell was such an unreliable narrator? A question to consider is whether he presented himself in a true light, or manipulated his description of events to prevent the reader from discovering his true character. However\"by the end of the novel Dowell has tested the limits of rational explanation. He has interpreted character by religion, by nationality, by gender, and by the calendar…Dowell's disillusionment follows the arc of modernism. He begins with presuppositions typical of much Victorian characterization: the individual conditioned by circumstance, composed of intelligible motives, susceptible to moral analysis-the justified self. Then, confronted with the singularity of desire, his 'generalizations' totter and fall.\"Dowell admits that his assumptions and characterisations of people in his life may be flawed. Whether that is because of guilt, or an attempt to reshape history in his favour, there is no clear answer.\n\nThe novel was adapted into the television film of the same title by Granada Television in 1981. It starred Jeremy Brett, Vickery Turner, Robin Ellis and Susan Fleetwood. It was directed by Kevin Billington and written by Julian Mitchell. In the US it aired as part of the \"Masterpiece Theatre\" series.\n\nThe novel was adapted as a BBC Radio 4 Book at Bedtime by Ross Kemp in 2008, read by Toby Stephens and produced by Kirsty Williams.\n\nBurt, Daniel S. \"The Novel 100\".

The series is based on a pilot film of the same name, which aired on September 30, 1969 as an ABC Movie of the Week. The pilot is based on the science fiction novel \"The Immortals\", by James Gunn. The series music was composed by Dominic Frontiere, who is primarily known for scoring the sci-fi anthology series \"The Outer Limits\". Although \"The Immortal\" was canceled at midseason, episodes were rerun by ABC in the summer of 1971. It was later rerun on the Armed Forces Network in Europe in the 1980s and on the Sci Fi Channel in the 1990s.\n\n\"This man has a singular advantage over other men. Ben Richards is immune to every known disease, including old age.

I gotta live free!\n\"Ben Richards will live longer than anyone has ever lived, but a transfusion to the wrong man could make him a prisoner for all time. And so he runs from the hunters, the human hounds who would cage him.\"\n\nBen Richards is a test car driver for a large corporation owned by billionaire Jordan Braddock. He is 42 years old, but looks young enough to pass for 25—and he has never been sick a day in his life. Ben's life changes when he donates a pint of blood. When Braddock, who is dying, is given a transfusion of his donated blood, and is brought back from the brink of death, Ben's physician, Dr. Matthew Pearce, determines that his O-negative blood contains all known antibodies and immunities. This gives Ben immunity to every known disease and an estimated lifespan five to ten times that of other humans, making him, in the doctor's words, \"virtually immortal\". The billionaire decides that he has to control Richards' life so he can access his life-saving blood.\n\nWhen Richards rejects all of Braddock's offers to remain with him, the billionaire has him imprisoned, but he ultimately escapes. Richards tells his fiancé Sylvia Cartwright that they can never marry because she would also be imprisoned by Braddock (in the episode \"Sylvia\" Richards puts himself in danger to visit Cartwright at her wedding to another man). Richards is now on the run because when Braddock dies (shown in the flashback episode \"To The Gods Alone\" which resolved plot points between the pilot and the series), one of his former employees, Fletcher (who did not appear in the pilot), is hired by another billionaire, Arthur Maitland, who also wants access to Richards' blood.\n\nThe series' dramatic tension is based on the idea that Richards would probably never lose his life if he were to live quietly, since he would never succumb to any known diseases. But his flight from Fletcher puts his life at great risk, constantly engaging in dangerous efforts to avoid capture, and his \"immortal\" blood did not make him immune to losing his life from trauma.\n\nThe series primarily focuses on Richards' journeys and the people he meets while trying to avoid Fletcher. A secondary plot involved Richards' search for a brother he has never known, with the implication that that brother may share his gift and thus be at risk from unscrupulous billionaires as well. Ben Richards is imprisoned by a young billionaire, Simon Brent, in an episode titled \"The Queen's Gambit.\" In the episode \"Man On A Punched Card\" Maitland hires computer programmer Terry Kerwin to track and predict Richards' movements using a mainframe computer. Kerwin was played by Christopher George's real-life wife Lynda Day George, who would co-star on another Paramount TV series \"\" from 1971 to 1973.\n\nThe plotline of \"The Immortal\" is quite different from that of the book on which it is based (the protagonist of the book was a vagrant, not a test driver, who discovers his immortality when he sells his blood). Instead, \"The Immortal\" bears more than a superficial resemblance to the then-recent, very popular TV series, \"The Fugitive\", which still aired in syndicated reruns. That series had ended its four-season run three years before\"The Immortal\" began. It is also the mirror of the series \"Run for Your Life\" about a man suffering from a terminal disease who wants to experience everything because he is going to die soon, while Richards has to run because he will live virtually forever. \"The Immortal\" was cancelled before a finale episode was filmed.\n\n\nOn October 16, 2017, it was announced that Visual Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series. They subsequently released The Immortal - 'The Complete Collection' on DVD in Region 1 on November 9, 2017.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4445638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4445638", "title": "Turkification", "text": "Turkification\n\nTurkification, or Turkicization (), is a cultural shift whereby populations or states adopted a historical Turkic culture, such as in the Ottoman Empire. As the Turkic states developed and grew, there were many instances of this cultural shift.\n\nDiverse people were effected by Turkification including Anatolian, Balkan, Caucasian and Middle Eastern peoples from different ethnic origins, such as Albanians, Armenians, Assyrians, Circassians, Georgians, Greeks, Jews, Romani, Slavs, Kurds living in Anatolia, as well as Lazs from all the regions of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAn early form of Turkification occurred in the time of the Seljuk Empire among the local population of Anatolia, involving intermarriages, religious conversion, linguistic shift and interethnic relationships, which today is reflected in the genetic makeup of the modern Turkish people.\nPrior to the 20th century the region underwent Ottomanization. These terms started being used interchangeably after the rise of Turkish nationalism in the 20th century.\n\nThe term has been used in the Greek language since the 1300s or late-Byzantine era as \"εκτουρκισμός\", or \"τούρκεμα\". It literally means \"becoming Turk\". Apart from persons, it may refer also to cities that were conquered by Turks or churches that were converted to mosques. It is more frequently used in the form of the verb \"τουρκεύω\" (\"turkify\", \"become Muslim or Turk\")\n\nBy 750 the Turkification of Kashgar by the Qarluq Turks was underway. (The Qarluqs were ancestors of the Karakhanids, who also Islamized the population). The language of Khwarezm, a Central Asian oasis region, eventually died out as a result of Turkification.\n\nAnatolia was home to many different peoples in ancient times who were either natives or settlers and invaders. These different people included the Armenians, Anatolian peoples, Persians, Hurrians, Greeks, Cimmerians, Galatians, Colchians, Iberians, Arameans, Assyrians, Corduenes, and scores of others. The presence of many Greeks, and the process of Hellenization, gradually caused many of these peoples to abandon their own languages in favor of Greek, especially in cities and along the western and southern coasts, a process reinforced by Romanization. Nevertheless, in the north and east, especially in rural areas, many of the native languages continued to survive, including both many extinct and a few extant languages such as Armenian and Assyrian Aramaic. Byzantine authorities routinely conducted large-scale population transfers in an effort to impose religious uniformity and the Greek language. After the subordination of the First Bulgarian Empire in 1018, for instance, much of its army was resettled in Eastern Anatolia. The Byzantines were particularly keen to assimilate the large Armenian population. To that end, in the eleventh century, the Armenian nobility were removed from their lands and resettled throughout western Anatolia. An unintended consequence of this resettlement was the loss of local military leadership along the eastern frontier, opening the path for the inroads of Turkish invaders. Beginning in the eleventh century, war with Turks led to the deaths of many in the native population, while others were enslaved and removed. As areas became depopulated, Turkic nomads moved in with their herds.\n\nThe number of nomads of Turkic origin that migrated to Anatolia is a matter of discussion. According to Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi, there were 200,000 Turkmen tents in Denizli and its surrounding areas, 30,000 in Bolu and its environment, and about 100,000 in Kastamonu and its environment. According to a Latin source at the end of the 12th century there were 100,000 nomadic tents in the regions of Denizli and Isparta.\n\nAccording to Ottoman tax archives, in modern-day Anatolia, in Anatolia Eyalet, Karaman Eyalet, Dulkadir Eyalet and Rûm Eyalet provinces there were about 872,610 households in 1520s and 1530s; 160,564 of those households were nomadic, and the remainder were sedentary. Of four provinces, province of Anatolia had the largest nomadic population with 77,268 households. (note: province of Anatolia does not include entire Anatolia, it includes Western Anatolia and some parts of Northwestern Anatolia only) Between 1570 and 1580, 220,217 households of the total 1,360,474 households in the four provinces were nomadic which means, at least 20% of Anatolia was still nomadic in the 16th century. The province of Anatolia, which had the largest nomadic population with 77,268, saw an increase in its nomadic population. 116,219 households in those years in province of Anatolia were nomadic. \n\nDevşirme (literally \"collecting\" in Turkish), also known as the \"blood tax\", was chiefly the annual practice by which the Ottoman Empire sent military to press second or third sons of their Christian subjects (Rum millet) in the villages of the Balkans into military training as janissaries. They were then converted to Islam with the primary objective of selecting and training the ablest children for the military or civil service of the Empire, notably into the Janissaries.\nStarted by Murad I as a means to counteract the growing power of the Turkish nobility, the practice itself violated Islamic law. Yet by 1648, the practice was slowly drawing to an end. An attempt to re-institute it in 1703 was resisted by its Ottoman members who coveted its military and civilian posts. Finally in the early part of Ahmet III's reign, the practice of devshirme was abolished.\n\nThe late Ottoman government sought to create \"a core identity with a single Turkish religion, language, history, tradition, culture and set of customs\", replacing earlier Ottoman traditions that had not sought to assimilate different religions or ethnic groups.The Ottoman Empire had an ethnically diverse population that included Turks, Arabs, Albanians, Greeks, Persians, Bulgarians, Serbs, Muslim Bulgarians, Armenians, Kurds, Zazas, Circassians, Assyrians, Jews and Laz people. Turkish nationalists claimed that only Turks were loyal to the state. Ideological support for Turkification was not widespread in the Ottoman Empire.\nOne of its main supporters was sociologist and political activist Ziya Gokalp who believed that a modern state must become homogeneous in terms of culture, religion, and national identity. This conception of national identity was augmented by his belief in the primacy of Turkishness, as a unifying virtue. As part of this belief, it was necessary to purge from the territories of the state those national groups who could threaten the integrity of a modern Turkish nation state.\n\nTurkfication sought to loosen ties between the Empire's Turk and ethnically non-Turkish populations through efforts to purify the Turkish language of Arabic influences. In this nationalist vision of Turkish identity, language was supreme and religion relegated to a subordinate role. Arabs responded by asserting the superiority of Arabic language, describing Turkish as a \"mongrel\" language that had borrowed heavily from the Persian and Arabic languages. Through the policy of Turkification, the Young Turk government suppressed Arabic language. Turkish teachers were hired to replace Arabic teachers at schools.\n\nThose who supported Turkification were accused of harming Islam. Rashid Rida was an advocate who supported Arabic against Turkish. Even before the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Syrian Reformer Tahrir al-Jazairi had convinced Midhat Pasha to adopt Arabic as the official language of instruction at state schools. The language of instruction was only changed to Turkish in 1885 under Sultan Abdulhamid. Though writers like Ernest Dawn have noted that the foundations of Second Constitutional Era \"Arabism\" predate 1908, the prevailing view still holds that Arab nationalism emerged as a response to the Ottoman Empire's Turkification policies. One historian of Arab nationalism wrote that: \"the Unionists introduced a grave provocation by opposing the Arab language and adopting a policy of Turkification\", but not all scholars agree about the contribution of Turkification policies to Arab nationalism.\n\nEuropean critics who accused the CUP of depriving non-Turks of their rights through Turkification saw Turk, Ottoman and Muslim as synonymous, and believed Young Turk \"Ottomanism\" posed a threat to Ottoman Christians. The British ambassador Gerard Lowther said it was like \"pounding non-Turkish elements in a Turkish mortar\", while another contemporary European source complained that the CUP plan would reduce \"the various races and regions of the empire to one dead level of Turkish uniformity.\" Rifa'at 'Ali Abou-El-Haj has written that \"some Ottoman cultural elements and Islamic elements were abandoned in favor of Turkism, a more potent device based on ethnic identity and dependent on a language based nationalism\".\n\nThe Young Turk government launched a series of initiatives that included forced assimilation. Ümit Üngör writes that \"Muslim Kurds and Sephardi Jews were considered slightly more 'Turkifiable' than others\", noting that many of these nationalist era \"social engineering\" policies perpetuated persecution \"with little regard for proclaimed and real loyalties.\" These policies culminated in Armenian and Assyrian genocides.\n\nDuring World War I, the Ottoman government established orphanages throughout the empire which included Armenian, Kurdish and Turkish children. Armenian orphans were given Arabic and Turkish names. By October 1918, with the Ottoman army retreating from Lebanon, a Father Sarlout sent the Turkish and Kurdish orphans to Damascus, while keeping the Armenian orphans in Antoura. He began the process of reversing the Turkification process by having the Armenian orphans recall their original names. It is believed by various scholars, that at least two million Turks have at least one Armenian grandparent.\n\nAround 1.5 million Ottoman Greeks remained in the Ottoman Empire after loses of 550,000 during WWI. Almost all, 1,250,000, except for those in Constantinople, had fled before or were forced to go to Greece in 1923 in the population exchanges mandated by the League of Nations after the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). The lingual Turkification of Greek-speakers in 19th-century Anatolia is well documented. According to Speros Vryonis the Karamanlides are the result of partial Turkification that occurred earlier, during the Ottoman period.. Fewer than 300,000 Armenians remained of 1.8 million before the war; fewer than 100,000 of 400,000 Assyrians.\n\nWhen the modern Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, nationalism and secularism were two of the founding principles. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the leader of the early years of the Republic, aimed to create a nation state (Turkish: Ulus) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire. Kemalist ideology defines the \"Turkish People\" as \"those who protect and promote the moral, spiritual, cultural and humanistic values of the Turkish Nation.\" One of the goals of the establishment of the new Turkish state was to ensure \"the domination of Turkish ethnic identity in every aspect of social life from the language that people speak in the streets to the language to be taught at schools, from the education to the industrial life, from the trade to the cadres of state officials, from the civil law to the settlement of citizens to particular regions.\"\n\nThe process of unification through Turkification continued within modern Turkey with such policies as:\n\nA process of turkification of Mongol conquerors and Iranian locals in Central Asia, as Turkic language used both by conquerors and locals as lingua franca.\n\nThe Turkic peoples have influenced and assimilated neighboring peoples also elsewhere. Examples include the Qaratays (a Tatarized former group of the Moksha people), the Besermyans (a partially Tatarized subgroup of the Udmurt people), and the Koibals (a Khakassized former group of the Samoyedic peoples).\n\nDuring the 19th century, the word \"Türk\" was a derogatory term used to refer to Anatolian villagers; the Ottoman elite identified themselves as Ottomans, not as Turks. In the late 19th century, as European ideas of nationalism were adopted by the Ottoman elite, and as it became clear that the Turkish-speakers of Anatolia were the most loyal supporters of Ottoman rule, the term \"Türk\" took on a much more positive connotation.\n\nDuring Ottoman times, the millet system defined communities on a religious basis, and a residue remains today in that Turkish villagers will commonly consider as Turks only those who profess the Sunni faith, and they consider Turkish-speaking Jews, Christians, or even Alevis to be non-Turks.\n\nThe imprecision of the appellation \"Türk\" can also be seen with other ethnic names, such as \"Kürt\", which is often applied by western Anatolians to anyone east of Adana, even those who speak only Turkish. On the other hand, Kurdish-speaking or Arabic-speaking Sunnis of eastern Anatolia are often considered to be Turks.\n\nThus, the category \"Türk\", like other ethnic categories popularly used in Turkey, does not have a uniform usage. In recent years, centrist Turkish politicians have attempted to redefine this category in a more multicultural way, emphasizing that a \"Türk\" is anyone who is a citizen of the Republic of Turkey. Now, article 66 of the Turkish Constitution defines a \"Turk\" as anyone who is \"bound to the Turkish state through the bond of citizenship\".\n\nThe region of the Anatolia represents an extremely important area with respect to ancient population migration and expansion, and the spread of the Caucasian, Semitic, Indo-European and Turkic languages, as well as the extinction of the local Anatolian languages. During the late Roman Period, prior to the Turkic conquest, the population of Anatolia had reached an estimated level of approximately 4 million people. Several studies examined the extent to which gene flow from Central Asia has contributed to the current gene pool of the Turkish people, and the role of the 11th century invasion by Turkic peoples. A 2002 study concluded that Turks do not significantly differ from other Mediterranean populations, indicating that while the Asian Turks carried out an invasion with cultural significance (language and religion), the genetic significance is lesser detectable. A genetic research from 2001 has suggested the local Anatolian origins of the Turkic Asian peoples might have been slight. In 2003, DNA results suggested there was no strong genetic relationship between the Mongols and the Turks people despite the historical relationship of their languages. \n\nIn 2014, however, the largest autosomal study on Turkish genetics (on 16 individuals) concluded the weight of East Asian (presumably Central Asian) migration legacy of the Turkish people is estimated at 21.7%. The authors conclude on the basis of previous studies that \"South Asian contribution to Turkey's population was significantly higher than East/Central Asian contributions, suggesting that the genetic variation of medieval Central Asian populations may be more closely related to South Asian populations, or that there was continued low level migration from South Asia into Anatolia.\" They note that these weights are not direct estimates of the migration rates as the original donor populations are not known, and the exact kinship between current East Asians and the medieval Oghuz Turks is uncertain. For instance, genetic pools of Central Asian Turkic peoples is particularly diverse and modern Oghuz Turkmens living in Central Asia are with higher West Eurasian genetic component than East Eurasian.\n\nThese findings are consistent with a model in which the Turkic languages, originating in the Altai-Sayan region of Central Asia and northwestern Mongolia, were imposed on the indigenous peoples with genetic admixture, shows both ethnic mixing and linguistic replacement. Genetically, Anatolian Turks were more closely related also with Balkan populations than to the Central Asian populations in early history. After eleven decades of Turkic migration to Anatolia including Oghuz and Kipchak Turkic people from Central Asia, Persia, Caucassia and Crimea, today's population is genetically in between Central Asia and indigenous historic Anatolia. Similar results come from neighbouring Caucasus region by testing Armenian and Turkic speaking Azerbaijani populations, therefore representing language replacements and intermarriages. As of 2004, the haplogroups in Turkey are shared with European and neighboring Near Eastern populations and haplogroups related to Central Asian, South Asian and African affinity, which supports both the mass migration, and language replacement hypothesis on the region and ethnic mixing.\n\nA 2011 haplogroup study concluded \"that the profile of Anatolian populations today is the product not of mass westward migrations of Central Asians and Siberians, or of small-scale migrations into an emptied subcontinent, but instead of small-scale, irregular punctuated migration events that engendered large-scale shifts in language and culture among the diverse\" indigenous inhabitants (p. 32). A haplogroup study in 2017 concluded that \"the modern Turks are a hybrid population, comprising the original Anatolian stock, Turkic people, as well as other ethnicities from regions of the former Ottoman Empire\". Results of a 2012 genetic study by Hodoğlugil and Mahley showed the admixture of Turkish people, which were primarily European (French, Italian, Sardinian) and Middle Eastern (Druze, Palestinian), with a Central Asian (Uyghur, Kyrgyz, Hazara) (9%-15%) component.\n\n\n"}

Yene are believed to act as a vessel where the ancestor spirit would reside temporarily before departing to the land of the dead. \n\nThree kinds of statues are found throughout the Maluku Islands: Statues of ancestors; statues of progenitors (linked to the origin and foundation of the descendants), and statues of the cosmos (heaven and earth) represented as male and female, respectively.\n\nIn the Leti Islands, yene are small-sized statues of the ancestors, usually depicted seated. The statues represent deceased family members. The posture of the yene indicates the gender of the deceased. Male ancestors are shown in a squatting position, while females are shown with crossed-legs. Yene statues have been recorded since the 17th century, with some showing signs of contact with the west. Some male ancestors statues show a squatting figure on top of a western-style chair, which may indicate that the deceased has been converted to Christianity.\n\nAt places where a caste system existed, leti statues also indicate the rank of the deceased. Members of the highest caste are represented with jewelry, such as earrings and headgear that look like bishops' mitres. Lower caste yene are usually represented without jewelry or complex ornaments. Feather ornamentation indicates the deceased was a warrior.\n\nThe yene functioned as a sort of temporary vessel for the spirit of the deceased before they depart to the land of the dead. The Leti Islanders believed that a human has both a physical body and an abstract \"shadow\", somewhat comparable to a soul or mind. The \"shadow\" is believed to persist even after death. After death, his or her \"shadow\" wanders for a few days in the village before it leaves for the land of the dead, which is said to be situated on an uninhabited island, such as a reef or a cape, not far from the world of the living. \n\nThe yene sculpture allowed the relatives of the departed to communicate with the departed spirit, either for consultation on important matters or to be given offerings during annual ceremonies. The Leti society are strongly dependent on the ancestor spirits for many things, such as fertility. Generally the yene statues are offered sirih and pinang. Sometimes palm wine is combined with the offering. \n\nYene sculptures are arranged in the attic of house of Leti Islanders. The spirits are thought to reach the attic through specially-fitted hatches in the facade.\n"}
{"id": "20780721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20780721", "title": "Yes and no", "text": "Yes and no\n\nYes and no, or word pairs with a similar usage, are expressions of the affirmative and the negative, respectively, in several languages including English. Some languages make a distinction between answers to affirmative versus negative questions, thus they may have triplets or quadruplets of words instead. English originally used a four-form system up to and including Early Middle English but Modern English has reduced this to a two-form system consisting of just 'yes' and 'no'. It exists in eye blink communication, Morse Code, sign language, and maybe in color coded flag communication. \n\nSome languages do not answer yes–no questions with single words meaning 'yes' or 'no'. Welsh and Finnish are among several languages that typically employ echo answers (repeating the verb with either an affirmative or negative form) rather than using words for 'yes' and 'no', though both languages do also have words broadly similar to 'yes' and 'no'. Other languages have systems named two-form, three-form, and four-form systems, depending on how many words for yes and no they employ. Some languages, such as Latin, do not have yes-no word systems.\n\nThe words \"yes\" and \"no\" are not easily classified into any of the eight conventional parts of speech. Although sometimes classified as interjections, they do not qualify as such, and they are not adverbs. They are sometimes classified as a part of speech in their own right, sentence words, word sentences, or pro-sentences, although that category contains more than \"yes\" and \"no\" and not all linguists include them in their lists of sentence words. Sentences consisting solely of one of these two words are classified as minor sentences.\n\nThe differences among languages, the fact that in different languages the various words for \"yes\" and \"no\" have different parts of speech and different usages, and that some languages lack a 'yes-no' word system, makes idiomatic translation difficult.\n\nAlthough sometimes classified as interjections, these words do not always express emotion or act as calls for attention; they are not adverbs because they do not qualify any verb, adjective, or adverb. They are sometimes classified as a part of speech in their own right: sentence words or word sentences.\n\nThis is the position of Otto Jespersen, who states that \"'Yes' and 'No' [...] are to all intents and purposes sentences just as much as the most delicately balanced sentences ever uttered by Demosthenes or penned by Samuel Johnson.\"\n\nGeorg von der Gabelentz, Henry Sweet, and Philipp Wegener have all written on the subject of sentence words. Both Sweet and Wegener include \"yes\" and \"no\" in this category, with Sweet treating them separately from both imperatives and interjections, although Gabelentz does not.\n\nWatts classifies \"yes\" and \"no\" as grammatical particles, in particular \"response particles\". He also notes their relationship to the interjections \"oh\" and \"ah\", which is that the interjections can precede \"yes\" and \"no\" but not follow them. \"Oh\" as an interjection expresses surprise, but in the combined forms \"oh yes\" and \"oh no\" merely acts as an intensifier; but \"ah\" in the combined forms \"ah yes\" and \"ah no\" retains its standalone meaning, of focusing upon the previous speaker's or writer's last statement. The forms \"*yes oh\", \"*yes ah\", \"*no oh\", and \"*no ah\" are grammatically ill-formed. Aijmer similarly categorizes the \"yes\" and \"no\" as \"response signals\" or \"reaction signals\".\n\nAmeka classifies these two words in different ways according to context. When used as back-channel items, he classifies them as interjections; but when they are used as the responses to a yes-no question, he classifies them as formulaic words. The distinction between an interjection and a formula is, in Ameka's view, that the former does not have an addressee (although it may be directed at a person), whereas the latter does. The \"yes\" or \"no\" in response to the question is addressed at the interrogator, whereas \"yes\" or \"no\" used as a back-channel item is a \"feedback usage\", an utterance that is said to oneself. However, Sorjonen criticizes this analysis as lacking empirical work on the other usages of these words, in addition to interjections and feedback uses.\n\nBloomfield and Hockett classify the words, when used to answer yes-no questions, as \"special completive interjections\". They classify sentences comprising solely one of these two words as minor sentences.\n\nSweet classifies the words in several ways. They are sentence-modifying adverbs, adverbs that act as modifiers to an entire sentence. They are also sentence words, when standing alone. They may, as question responses, also be absolute forms that correspond to what would otherwise be the \"not\" in a negated echo response. For example, a \"No.\" in response to the question \"Is he here?\" is equivalent to the echo response \"He is not here.\" Sweet observes that there is no correspondence with a simple \"yes\" in the latter situation, although the sentence-word \"Certainly.\" provides an absolute form of an emphatic echo response \"He is certainly here.\" Many other adverbs can also be used as sentence words in this way.\n\nUnlike \"yes\", \"no\" can also be an adverb of degree, applying to adjectives solely in the comparative (e.g. \"no greater\", \"no sooner\", but not \"no soon\" or \"no soonest\"), and an adjective when applied to nouns (e.g. \"He is no fool.\" and Dyer's \"No clouds, no vapours intervene.\").\n\nGrammarians of other languages have created further, similar, special classifications for these types of words. Tesnière classifies the French \"oui\" and \"non\" as \"phrasillons logiques\" (along with \"voici\"). Fonagy observes that such a classification may be partly justified for the former two, but suggests that \"pragmatic holophrases\" is more appropriate.\n\nWhile Modern English has a \"two-form system\" of \"yes\" and \"no\" for affirmatives and negatives, earlier forms of English had a \"four-form system\", comprising the words \"yea\", \"nay\", \"yes\", and \"no\". In essence, \"yes\" and \"no\" were the responses to a question posed in the negative, whereas \"yea\" and \"nay\" were the responses to positively framed questions.\n\nThis is exemplified by the following passage from Much Ado about Nothing:\nBenedick's answer of \"yea\" is a correct application of the rule, but as observed by W. A. Wright \"Shakespeare does not always observe this rule, and even in the earliest times the usage appears not to have been consistent.\" Furness gives as an example the following, where Hermia's answer should, in following the rule, have been \"yes\":\nThis subtle grammatical feature of Early Modern English is recorded by Sir Thomas More in his critique of William Tyndale's translation of the New Testament into Early Modern English, which was then quoted as an authority by later scholars:\n\nIn fact, More's exemplification of the rule actually contradicts his statement of what the rule is. This went unnoticed by scholars such as Horne Tooke, Robert Gordon Latham, and Trench, and was first pointed out by George Perkins Marsh in his \"Century Dictionary\", where he corrects More's incorrect statement of the first rule, \"\"No\" aunswereth the question framed by the affirmative.\", to read \"nay\". That even More got the rule wrong, even while himself dressing down Tyndale for getting it wrong, is seen by Furness as evidence that the four word system was \"too subtle a distinction for practice\".\n\nMarsh found no evidence of a four-form system in Mœso-Gothic, although he reported finding \"traces\" in Old English. He observed that in the Anglo-Saxon Gospels,\n\nMarsh calls this four-form system of Early Modern English a \"needless subtlety\". Tooke called it a \"ridiculous distinction\", with Marsh concluding that Tooke believed Thomas More to have simply made this rule up and observing that Tooke is not alone in his disbelief of More. Marsh, however, points out (having himself analyzed the works of John Wycliffe, Geoffrey Chaucer, John Gower, John Skelton, and Robert of Gloucester, and \"Piers Plowman\" and \"Le Morte d'Arthur\") that the distinction both existed and was generally and fairly uniformly observed in Early Modern English from the time of Chaucer to the time of Tyndale. But after the time of Tyndale, the four-form system was rapidly replaced by the modern two-form system.\n\nSeveral languages have a \"three-form system\", with two affirmative words and one negative. In a three-form system, the affirmative response to a positively phrased question is the unmarked affirmative, the affirmative response to a negatively phrased question is the marked affirmative, and the negative response to both forms of question is the (single) negative. For example, in Norwegian the affirmative answer to \"Snakker du norsk?\" (\"Do you speak Norwegian?\") is \"Ja\", and the affirmative answer to \"Snakker du ikke norsk?\" (\"Do you not speak Norwegian?\") is \"Jo\", while the negative answer to \"both\" questions is \"Nei\".\n\nDanish, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Faroese, Hungarian, German, Dutch, and French all have three-form systems. Swedish and Danish have \"ja\", \"jo\", and \"nej\". Norwegian has \"ja\", \"jo\"/\"jau\", and \"nei\". Icelandic has \"já\", \"jú\" and \"nei\". Faroese has \"ja\", \"jú\" and \"nei\". Hungarian has \"igen\", \"de\", and \"nem\". German has \"ja\", \"doch\", and \"nein\". Dutch has \"ja\", \"jawel\", and \"nee\". French has \"oui\", \"si\", and \"non\".\n\nSwedish, and to some extent Danish and Norwegian, also has additional forms \"javisst\" and \"jovisst\", analogous to \"ja\" and \"jo\", to indicate a strong affirmative response. Swedish (and Danish slang) also have the forms \"joho\" and \"nehej\", which both indicate stronger response than \"jo\" or \"nej\". \"Jo\" can also be used as an emphatic contradiction of a negative statement.\n\nLike Early Modern English, the Romanian language has a four-form system. The affirmative and negative responses to positively phrased questions are \"da\" and \"nu\", respectively. But in responses to negatively phrased questions they are prefixed with \"ba\" (i.e. \"ba da\" and \"ba nu\"). \"nu\" is also used as a negation adverb, infixed between subject and verb. Thus, for example, the affirmative response to the negatively phrased question \"N-ai plătit?\" (\"Didn't you pay?\") is \"Ba da.\" (\"Yes.\"—i.e. \"I did pay.\"), and the negative response to a positively phrased question beginning \"Se poate să ...?\" (\"Is it possible to ...?\") is \"Nu, nu se poate.\" (\"No, it is not possible.\"—note the use of \"nu\" for both \"no\" and negation of the verb.)\n\nBloomfield and Hockett observe that not all languages have \"special completive interjections\". Finnish does not generally answer yes-no questions with either adverbs or interjections but answers them with a repetition of the verb in the question, negating it if the answer is the negative. (This is an echo response.) The answer to \"Tuletteko kaupungista?\" (\"Are you coming from town?\") is the verb form itself, \"Tulemme.\" (\"We are coming.\")\n\nNegative questions are answered similarly. Negative answers are just the negated verb form. The answer to \"Tunnetteko herra Lehdon?\" (\"Do you know Mr Lehto?\") is \"En tunne\" (\"I don't know.\") or simply \"En.\" (\"I don't.\"). However, Finnish also has particle words for \"yes\": \"Kyllä\" (formal) and \"joo\" (very colloquial). A yes-no question can be answered \"yes\" with either \"kyllä\" or \"joo\", which are not conjugated according to the person and plurality of the verb. \"Ei\", however, is always conjugated and means \"no\".\n\nUp until the 16th century Latvian also didn't have a word for \"yes\" and the common way of responding affirmatively to a question was by repeating the question's verb, just like in Finnish. The modern day \"jā\" was borrowed from Middle High German \"ja\" and first appeared in 16th-century religious texts, especially catechisms, in answers to questions about faith. At that time such works were usually translated from German by non-Latvians that had learned Latvian as a foreign language. By the 17th century \"jā\" was being used by some Latvian speakers that lived near the cities, and more frequently when speaking to non-Latvians, but they would revert to agreeing by repeating the question verb when talking among themselves. By the 18th century the use of \"jā\" was still of low frequency, and in Northern Vidzeme the word was almost non-existent till the 18th and early 19th century. Only in the mid-19th century did \"jā\" really become usual everywhere.\n\nIt is often said falsely that Welsh has no words at all for \"yes\" and \"no\". It has \"ie\" and \"nage\". However, these are used only in specialized circumstances and are but some of the \"many\" ways in Welsh of saying yes or no. As in Finnish, the main way to state yes or no, in answer to yes-no questions, is to echo the verb of the question. So the answers to \"'\" (\"Is Ffred coming?\") are either \"'\" (\"He is (coming).\") or \"'\" (\"He is not (coming)\"). In general, the negative answer is the positive answer combined with \"nag\". As in Finnish, this avoids the issue of what an unadorned \"yes\" means in response to a negative question. While a \"yes\" response to the question \"You don't like strawberries?\" is ambiguous in English, the Welsh response ' has no ambiguity. The same would apply for Finnish, where the question would be answered with \"\" (I don't). For more information on \"yes\" and \"no\" answers to yes-no questions in Welsh, see Jones, listed in further reading.\n\nThe Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx) do not have words for \"yes\" or \"no\" at all. Instead, an echo response of the main verb used to ask the question is used. Sometimes, one of the words meaning \"to be\" (Irish ' or ', see Irish syntax § The forms meaning \"to be\"; Scottish Gaelic ' or ' see Scottish Gaelic grammar § verbs; Manx ' or ') is used. For example, the Irish question \"'\" (\"Is he coming?\") may be answered \"\" (\"Is\") or \"\" (\"Is not\"). More frequently, another verb will be used. For example, to respond to \"'\" (\"Did he hear?\"), \"'\" (\"Heard\") or \"'\" (\"Did not hear\") are used. Irish people frequently give echo answers in English as well, e.g. \"Did you hear?\" Answer \"I heard/I did\". This also happens in the Galician language.\n\nLatin has no single words for \"yes\" and \"no\". Their functions as intensifiers and interjections are taken up by using the vocative case. Their functions as word sentence responses to yes-no questions are taken up by \"sentence adverbs\", single adverbs that are sentence modifiers and also used as word sentences. There are several such adverbs classed as truth-value adverbs—including \"certe\", \"fortasse\", \"nimirum\", \"plane\", \"vero\", \"etiam\", \"sane\", \"minime\", and \"videlicet\". They express the speaker's/writer's feelings about the truth value of a proposition. They, in conjunction with the negator \"non\", are used as responses to yes-no questions. For example:\n\nLatin also employs echo responses.\n\nSpeakers of Chinese use echo responses as well. In all languages, yes-no questions are often posed in A-not-A form, and the replies to such questions are echo answers that echo either \"A\" or \"not A\". In Mandarin Chinese, the closest equivalents to \"yes\" and \"no\" are to state \"是\" (\"shì\"; lit. \"is\") and \"不是\" (\"búshì\"; lit. \"not is\"). (In Cantonese, the preceding are 係 \"hai6\" and 唔係 \"m4 hai6\", respectively.) The phrase 不要 (buyào; lit. \"(I) do not want\") may also be used for the interjection \"no\".\n\nJapanese also lacks words for \"yes\" and \"no\". The words \"はい\" (\"hai\") and \"いいえ\" (\"iie\") are mistaken by English speakers for equivalents to \"yes\" and \"no\", but they actually signify agreement or disagreement with the proposition put by the question: \"That's right.\" or \"That's not right.\" For example: If asked, \"行かないのですか\" (\"ikanai no desu ka\" / \"Are you not going?\"), answering with the affirmative \"はい\" would mean \"Right, I am \"not\" going\"; whereas in English, answering \"yes\" would be to contradict the negative question. Echo responses are not uncommon in Japanese.\n\nThe words for \"yes\" and \"no\" in some languages originate from a process of devaluation and semantic erosion. The Hungarian strong affirmative \"persze\" was originally the Latin phrase \"per se intelligitur\" (\"it stands to reason\"), for example. German \"nein\" similarly is derived from the Old High German \"ni ein\", which means \"not a single one\". (In Latin, \"non\" similarly devolved from \"noenum\", which also means \"not one\".) The French \"oui\" was formerly \"oïl\" (after which Langue d'oïl is named), which, in turn, came from the Vulgar Latin \"hoc ille\", meaning \"this one\" (\"it is\" this one).\n\nIn Spanish, the words \"sí\" (yes) and \"no\" (no) are unambiguously classified as adverbs: not only do they serve as answers to questions; they also modify verbs. The affirmative \"sí\" can replace the verb after a negation (\"Yo no tengo carro, pero él sí = \"I don't own a car, but he does) or intensify it (\"I don't believe he owns a car. / He does own one!\" = \"No creo que él tenga carro. / ¡Sí lo tiene!\"). The word \"no\" is the standard adverb placed next to a verb to negate it (\"Yo no tengo carro\" = \"I don't own a car\"). Double negation is normal and valid in Spanish, and it is interpreted as reinforcing the negation (\"No tengo ningún carro\" = \"I own no car\").\n\nThese differences between languages make translation difficult. No two languages are isomorphic, even at the elementary level of words for \"yes\" and \"no\". Translation from two-form to three-form systems is something that English-speaking schoolchildren learning French or German soon encounter. But the mapping is not even as simple as converting two forms into three. There are many idioms, such as reduplication (in French, German, and Italian) of affirmatives for emphasis (the German \"ja ja ja\").\n\nFurthermore, the mappings are one-to-many in both directions. The German \"ja\" has no fewer than 13 English equivalents that vary according to context and usage (\"yes\", \"yeah\", and \"no\" when used as an answer; \"well\", \"all right\", \"so\", and \"now\", when used for segmentation; \"oh\", \"ah\", \"uh\", and \"eh\" when used an interjection; and \"do you\", \"will you\", and their various inflections when used as a marker for tag questions) for example. Moreover, both \"ja\" and \"doch\" are frequently used as additional particles for conveying nuanced meaning where, in English, no such particle exists. Straightforward, non-idiomatic, translations from German to English and then back to German can often result in the loss of all of the modal particles such as \"ja\" and \"doch\" from a text.\n\nTranslation from languages that have word systems to those that do not, such as Latin, is similarly problematic. As Calvert says, \"Saying yes or no takes a little thought in Latin\".\n\nThere are many variants of \"yes\" and \"no\" in English. Two such spoken forms are transcribed into writing as \"uh-huh\" or \"mm-hmm\" (\"yes\", with a rise in pitch on the second syllable) and \"uh-uh\" or \"mm-mm\" (\"no\", with a fall in pitch on the second syllable). Their sounds are a nasal or non-nasal sound interrupted by a voiceless breathy interval for \"yes\", and by a glottal stop for \"no\". These forms are particularly useful for speakers who are at a given time unable to articulate the actual words \"yes\" and \"no\". Mm-hmm may be a loanword from an African language.\n\nThe word \"aye\" (, like \"eye\") is a frequent synonym for \"yes\", particularly in Scotland, Ireland, and Northern England, although not always officially acknowledged as such. In December 1993, a witness in a Scottish court who had answered \"aye\" to confirm he was the person summoned was told by the Sheriff that he must answer either \"yes\" or \"no\". When his name was read again and he was asked to confirm it, he answered \"aye\" again, and was imprisoned for 90 minutes for contempt of court. On his release he said, \"I genuinely thought I was answering him.\"\n\n\"Aye\" is also a common word in parliamentary procedure. In the House of Commons and House of Lords of the British parliament, MPs or Lords vote orally on debates or legislations by saying \"aye\" or \"no\" to indicate they approve or disapprove of the measure. In the Parliament of Canada, the terms \"yea\" and \"nay\" are used instead. These and other Westminster system parliaments including those of Australia and New Zealand generally use the same or similar terms to designate positions during a formal division of the assembly that generally follows a challenged vote.\n\nIn naval language, the phrase Aye aye, sir is used to acknowledge a direct order, and indicates the speaker both understands the order and will comply with it; a single \"aye\" is a synonym for \"yes\" and simply indicates agreement.\n\nAnother affirmative phrase is \"why-aye man\" (alternatively \"whey-aye\" or \"wey-aye\") which is commonly found in Tyne and Wear, but can be heard well up into the north of Northumberland, south as far as Bishop Auckland and west into the Tyne Valley. It is an informal phrase used to express affirmation in situations where a simple \"aye\" would not be enough.\n\n\"Aye\" is not to be confused with the archaic term \"ay\" (pronounced , as in \"hay\"), which is used poetically to mean \"for ever\" or \"eternally\". \nIt is also sometimes also spelled \"aye\"; the spelling of \"aye\" and \"ay\" for the two meanings \"yes\" or \"for ever\" varies according to different authorities, and may be interchangeable in common usage.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "467969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=467969", "title": "Župa", "text": "Župa\n\nA župa (or zhupa, županija) is a historical type of administrative division in Central Europe and the Balkans, that originated in medieval Slavic culture, often translated into \"county\" or \"district\". It was mentioned for the first time in the 8th century. It was initially used by the South and West Slavs, denoting various territorial units of which the leader was the župan. In modern Croatian and Slovenian, the term \"župa\" also means an ecclesiastical parish.\n\nThe word \"župa\" (Bulgarian and Serbian Жупа; adopted into and rendered in Greek as \"ζουπανία\" (zoupania, \"land ruled by a župan\") is derived from Slavic. Its medieval Latin equivalent was \"comitatus\". It is mostly translated into \"county\" or \"district\". According to Kmietowicz, it seems that the territorial organization had been created in Polish territories before the Slav Migrations. Some Slavic nations changed its name into \"opole\", \"okolina\" and \"vierw\", but it has survived in \"župan\". Some scholars consider the word's older meaning was \"open area in the valley\". This interpretation is confirmed by the Bulgarian \"župa\" (tomb), Polish \"zupa\" and Ukrainian \"župa\" (salt mine), and Old Slavonic \"župište\" (tomb). As such, the Proto-Slavic \"*župa\" wouldn't derive from \"*gheu-p-\" (with \"*gheu-\" meaning \"bend, distort\"), yet from Indo-European \"*g(h)eup-/*gheub-\" meaning \"cavity, pit\", which derives from Nostratic \"*gopa\" meaning \"hollow, empty\". However, Albert Bruckner suggested the opposite evolution; \"župa\" as a back formation from title \"župan\" (for the etymology see corresponding article), which is a borrowing from Iranian languages (*\"fsu-pāna\", \"shepherd\").\n\nThe division had a widespread distribution, and did not always had a concrete institutional definition. The term \"župa\" signified the territorial and administrative unit of a tribe, and later only an administrative unit without tribal feature. The South Slavs that settled in Roman lands to a certain degree adopted Roman state organization, but retained their own tribal organization. Slavic tribes were divided into fraternities, each including a certain number of families. The territory inhabited by a tribe was a \"župa\", and its leader was the \"župan\".\n\nThe \"zhupa\" (plural \"zhupi\") was an administrative unit in the First Bulgarian Empire, a subdivision of a larger unit called \"comitatus\". In these countries, the equivalent of \"county\" is \"judet\" (from Latin \"judicium\"). The Croats and the Slovaks used the terms županija and župa for the counties in the Kingdom of Croatia and Kingdom of Hungary. German language translation of the word for those counties was \"komitat\" (from Latin \"comitatus\", \"countship\") during the Middle Ages, but later it was \"gespanschaft\" (picking up the \"span\" root that previously came from \"župan\").\n\nThe Croatian word župa signifies both a secular unit (county) and a religious unit (parish), ruled over by a \"župan\" (count) and \"župnik\" (parish priest).\n\nCroatian medieval state was divided into eleven \"ζουπανίας\" (zoupanias; župas), and the ban ruled over additional three župas Krbava, Lika, and Gacka).\n\nToday the term \"županija\" is the name for the Croatian regional government, the counties of Croatia. Mayors of counties hold the title of \"župan\" (pl. \"župani\"), which is usually translated as \"county prefect\". In the 19th century, the counties of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia were called \"županija\". The Croats preserved the term \"župa\" until the modern times as the name for local clerical units, parishes of the Catholic Church and of the Protestant churches. The parish priest is called \"župnik\".\n\nIn c. 1074, the župa is mentioned in Hungary as \"-spán\", also as \"határispánságok\" (march, frontier county). The derivative titles were \"ispán\", nominated by the king for not defined time, and gradually replaced by \"főispán\" in the 18-19th century; \"megyésispán\", also nominated by the king but could be expelled anytime; \"alispán\" was the leader of the jurisdiction in the county if the 'megyésispán' was not available; \"várispán\" was more linked to the \"vár\" (fortress) in Hungary in the times of Árpád.\n\nThe Serbs in the Early Middle Ages were organized into \"župe\", a confederation of village communities (roughly the equivalent of a county), headed by a local \"župan\" (a magistrate or governor). Thus the title of Grand Župan in Raška in 11th-12th century meant \"supreme župan\" of župans who ruled over župas.\n\n\"Dušan's Code\" (1349) named the administrative hierarchy as following: \"lands, cities, župas and krajištes\", the župas and krajištes were one and the same, with the župas on the borders were called krajištes (\"frontier\"). The župa consisted of villages, and their status, rights and obligations were regulated in the constitution. The ruling nobility possessed hereditary allodial estates, which were worked by dependent \"sebri\", the equivalent of Greek \"paroikoi\"; peasants owing labour services, formally bound by decree.\n\nThough the territorial unit today is unused, there are a number of traditional župe in Kosovo, around Prizren: Sredačka Župa, Sirinićka Župa, Gora, Opolje and Prizrenski Podgor. The Serbian language maintains the word in toponyms, the best known being that of the Župa Aleksandrovačka.\n\nThe term \"župa\" was popularized in Slovak professional literature in the 19th century as a synonym to contemporary Slovak term \"stolica\" (county). After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, it was used as the official name of administrative units of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia in 1919 - 1928 and then again in the Slovak Republic during WWII in 1940-1945. Nowadays, the term is used semi-officially as a short alternative name for the self-governing regions of Slovakia. President of the self-governing region is semi-officially called \"župan\".\n\nDuring World War II, when Slovenia was partitioned between Italy, Hungary, and Germany on 17 April 1941, in the Italian portion, named province of Ljubljana, the new administration was led by an Italian High Commissioner, but there also were Presidents of the Council of Zhupans of Ljubljana: Marko Natlačen (1941), Leon Rupnik (1942-1943).\n\n\n"}
