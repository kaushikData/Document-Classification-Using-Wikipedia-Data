Similar to Greek sophists, some Indian rhetors in the seventh century BCE held public debates on religion to the public’s amusement. The Vedic verses, composed over three thousand years ago, use similes, similar to ancient Greek poetry.\n\nIndian rhetoric utilizes systems of categorization. These categorizations appear in early Buddhist writing. Similarly, India’s Hindu caste system led to differences in how member of different castes addressed each other, with people from lower castes referring to themselves in a derogatory manner. Additionally, the Upanishads, a collection of ancient Brahmin dialogues, place value in categorizing technical terms.\n\nIndian Buddhist rhetoric places value in calm and humorous discourse.\n\nLloyd (2007) has proposed Nyaya’s inclusion in the field of rhetorical studies, exploring its methods within their historical context, comparing its approach to the “traditional logical syllogism, and relating it to the contemporary perspectives Stephen Toulmin, Kenneth Burke, and Chaim Perelman.”\n\nNyaya is a Sanskrit word which means just or right and refers to “the science of right and wrong reasoning” (Radhakrishnan & Moore, 1957, p. 356). Sutra is also a Sanskrit word which means string or thread. Here Sutra refers to a collection of aphorism in the form of a manual. Each Sutra is a short rule usually consisted of one or two sentences. Example of a Sutra: “Reality is truth, and what is true is so, irrespective of whether we know it is, or are aware of that truth.” The Nyaya Sutra is an ancient Indian Sanskrit text composed by Aksapada Gautama. It is the foundational text of the Nyaya School of Hindu Philosophy. The date when the text was composed, and the biography of its author is unknown. It is estimated that the text was composed between 6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE. Zimmer (2013) has said that the text may have been composed by more one author, over a period of time. Radhakrishan and Moore (1957) placed its origin in the “third century BC…..though some of the contents of the Nyaya Sutra are certainly a post-Christian era” (p. 36). Vidyabhusana (1930) stated that the ancient school of Nyaya extended over a period of one thousand years, beginning with Gotama about 550 BC and ending with Vatsyayana about 400 AD.\n\n\"Nyaya\" provides significant insight into the Indian rhetoric. Naya presents an argumentative approach that works a rhetor how to decide about any argument. In addition, it proposes a new approach of thinking of a cultural tradition which is different from the Western rhetoric. It also broadens the view of rhetoric and the relationship among human beings. \"Nyaya\" proposes an enlightenment of reality which is associated with situations, time, and places. Toulmin emphasizes on the situational dimension of argumentative genre as the fundamental component of any rhetorical logic. On the contrary, \"Nyaya\" views this situational rhetoric in a new way which offers context of practical arguments.\n"}

In higher education, a positive assessment culture is characterized by trusting relationships, data-informed decision-making, a respect for the profession of teaching, and an internally-driven thirst for discovery about student learning. Positive assessment culture generally connotes the existence of conditions for collaboration among practitioners, reward structures and professional development opportunities for faculty and staff, student involvement and a shared commitment among leaders to making institutional improvements that are sustainable. Assessment culture may be revealed behaviorally through factors such as: celebration of successes, comprehensive program review, shared use of common terminology and language, provision of technical support, and use of affirmative messaging to effectively convey meaning. Culture of assessment has been measured by scholars of perceptions among faculty to determine motivations, sense of support, and levels of fear related to assessment.\n"}

{"id": "30531158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30531158", "title": "Authenticity in art", "text": "Authenticity in art\n\nAuthenticity in art is the different ways in which a work of art or an artistic performance may be considered authentic.\nDenis Dutton distinguishes between \"nominal authenticity\" and \"expressive authenticity\".\nThe first refers to the correct identification of the author of a work of art, to how closely a performance of a play or piece of music conforms to the author's intention, or to how closely a work of art conforms to an artistic tradition.\nThe second sense refers to how much the work possesses original or inherent authority, how much sincerity, genuineness of expression, and moral passion the artist or performer puts into the work.\n\nA quite different concern is the authenticity of the experience, which may be impossible to achieve. A modern visitor to a museum may not only see an object in a very different context from that which the artist intended, but may be unable to understand important aspects of the work. The authentic experience may be impossible to recapture.\n\nAuthenticity is a requirement for inscription upon the UNESCO World Heritage List. According to the \"Nara Document on Authenticity\", it can be expressed through 'form and design; materials and substance; use and function; traditions and techniques; location and setting; spirit and feeling; and other internal and external factors.'\n\nAuthenticity of provenance means that the origin or authorship of a work of art has been correctly identified.\nAs Lionel Trilling points out in his 1972 book \"Sincerity and Authenticity\", the question of authenticity of provenance has acquired a profoundly moral dimension. Regardless of the appearance of the object or the quality of workmanship, there is great importance in knowing whether a vase is a genuine Ming vase or just a clever forgery.\nThis intense interest in authenticity is relatively recent and is largely confined to the western world. In the medieval period, and in countries such as modern Thailand, there was or is little interest in the identity of the artist.\n\nThe case of Han van Meegeren is well known. After failing to succeed as an artist in his own right, he turned to creating fake Vermeer paintings. These were accepted as genuine by experts and acclaimed as masterpieces. After being arrested for selling national treasures to the Germans, he caused a sensation when he publicly demonstrated that he was the artist.\nTo guard against forgeries like this, a certificate of authenticity may be used to prove that a work of art is authentic, but there is a sizable market in fake certificates.\nFurthermore a combination of art historical, conservational and technical evidence can be used to authenticate a work of art.The financial importance of authenticity may bias collectors to acquiring recent works of art where provenance can more easily be proven, perhaps even by a statement from the artist.\nFor older works, an increasingly sophisticated array of forensic techniques may be deployed to establish authenticity of provenance.\n\nThe philosopher Nelson Goodman discusses at length the question raised by Aline B. Saarinen: \"If a fake is so expert that even after the most thorough and trustworthy examination its authenticity is still open to doubt, is it or is it not as satisfactory a work of art as if it were unequivocally genuine?\" Goodman concludes that the question is academic, since there must be some way to distinguish a forgery from the original, and once the forgery is known for what it is, that knowledge alters the perception of value.\nHowever, Arthur Koestler in \"The Act of Creation\" answers that if a forgery fits into an artist's body of work and produces the same kind of aesthetic pleasure as other works by that artist, there is no reason to exclude it from a museum.\n\nThe question of the value of a forgery may be irrelevant to a curator, since they are concerned only with the provenance of the work and not with its artistic merit.\nEven for the curator, in many cases provenance is a matter of probabilities rather than a certainty - absolute proof is not possible.\nBut once a forgery has been exposed, no matter how highly the work was praised when it was thought to be \"authentic\" there is rarely any interest in evaluating the work on its own merit.\nReproduction is inherent to some forms of art. In Medieval Europe, an artist might create a drawing which was used by another craftsman to create a woodcut block. The drawing was usually destroyed in the block-cutting process, and the block was thrown away when it became worn out. The copies printed from the block are all that remain of the work.\nIn a 1936 essay, Walter Benjamin discussed the new media of photography and film, in which the work of art can be reproduced many times with no one version being the authentic \"original\". He linked this shift from authentic objects to broadly accessible mass media with a transformation in the function of art from ritual to politics.\nModern art may raise new issues of authenticity of provenance. For example, the artist Duane Hanson instructed the conservators of his 1971 sculpture \"Sunbather\" to feel free to replace elements such as the bathing cap or swimsuit if they became faded.\nAs Julian H. Scaff points out, the computer and the internet further confuse the issue of authenticity of provenance, since a digital work of art may exist in thousands or millions of identical versions, and in variants where there is no way to determine the original version or even the author.\n\nAuthenticity of provenance is concerned with identifying the person who made the work, or at least pinning down the place and time in which the work was made as closely as possible. Cultural authenticity, or authenticity of style or tradition, is concerned with whether a work is a genuine expression of an artistic tradition, even when the author may be anonymous. Interest in this form of authenticity may be associated with a romantic sense of the value of the pure, unadulterated tradition, often linked to nationalistic and possibly racist beliefs.\n\nA work of art may be considered an authentic example of a traditional culture or genre when it conforms to the style, materials, process of creation and other essential attributes of that genre.\nMany traditions are thought to be \"owned\" by an ethnic group, and work in that genre is only considered authentic if it is created by a member of that group. Thus Inuit art can only be considered authentic if created by an Inuit. This may help to protect the originators of an art tradition from cultural appropriation, but there is a racist aspect to the view as described by Joel Rudinow in his essay \"Race, Ethnicity, Expressive Authenticity: Can White People Sing the Blues?\"\n\nThe market for \"primitive art\" developed in the western world towards the end of the 19th century as explorers or colonialists came into contact with formerly unknown cultural groups in Africa, Asia and the Pacific. These people quickly learned how to incorporate new materials supplied by traders into their art, such as cloth and glass beads, but found that they could not sell these \"inauthentic\" objects. However, they learned how to manufacture works from local materials that would be considered authentic for sale to the westerners.\nThis process of creating art that will be considered authentic by western buyers continues to this day. The objects may be designed or modified to give the impression of having popular attributes and provenance, including religious or ritual uses, antiquity and association with royalty.\nSimilarly, in the 1940s Haitian professional artists began to create imitations of images provided by foreign entrepreneurs. The images represented the foreigners' view of the essence of Haitian Vodou art. The Haitian works were later claimed to be authentic.\nTo distinguish from crude objects made for the tourist trade, many collectors consider that a work is only an authentic example of a traditional genre if it meets certain standards of quality and was made for the original purpose. Dutton gives the example of the Igorot of northern Luzon who have long created figurines (\"bulul\") for use in traditional ceremonies, but today produce them primarily for the tourist trade. An Igorot family may purchase a roughly carved \"bulul\" from a tourist booth and use it for traditional ceremonies, thus giving authenticity to the work that would not, perhaps, be present otherwise.\nAlthough collectors place greater value on \"tribal\" masks or sculptures that have been used in an active ritual, it may be impossible to prove whether this is the case. Even if a video shows the mask being worn in a ritual dance, the dance may have been staged for tourists. Yet if the provenance of the mask is proven, if the mask was made by a member of the society using traditional designs and techniques, it is presumably an authentic example of the style or tradition.\n\nIt is not always clear what constitutes a style. For example, production of Zimbabwean stone sculptures is relatively recent, dating to the 1950s. It does not draw on any earlier tradition. However, the sculpture plays an important role in establishing the existence of a uniquely Zimbabwean culture, and the authenticity of this style is strongly emphasized by the government of Zimbabwe despite the difficulty of defining its characteristics.\nNavajo sand paintings raise a different issue. The traditional paintings must be destroyed on completion of the ritual in which they are used. However, Navajo artists create sand paintings for sale with slightly modified designs. Can these paintings be considered authentic examples of Navajo art?\n\nTraditions change. In an exploration of the evolution of the art of the Maroon people of French Guiana, Sally Price shows that contemporary styles have developed through a complex interaction between artists and buyers. The Maroons have a long tradition of artwork, primarily in the form of decoration of everyday objects such as paddles or shutters. This art was purely aesthetic in purpose, with no symbolic meaning. However, European collectors needed to assign symbolism to \"native art\". Over time, the Maroon artists have come to accept the European semiotic vocabulary and to assign symbolism to their work, which younger artists may believe to be based on ancestral traditions. The artists have also moved into new media and new designs. Their art may still be considered authentic examples of Maroon art, but the art form and the meaning associated with it is new.\n\nWith performance arts such as music and theater, both the composer or playwright and the performers are involved in creating an instance of the work. There are some who consider that a performance is only truly authentic if it approximates as closely as possible what the original author would have expected to see and hear. In a historically informed performance, the actors or musicians will make every effort to achieve this effect by using replicas of historical instruments, studying historical guides to acting and so on. They would consider, for example, that a performance of one of Mozart's piano concertos would be \"inauthentic\" if played on a modern concert grand piano, an instrument that would have been unknown to the composer.\n\nOthers would not take such a rigorous view. For example, they would accept a performance of a play by Shakespeare as authentic even if the female parts were played by women rather than boys, and if the words were spoken with modern pronunciation rather than with the pronunciation of the Elizabethan era, which would be difficult for a modern audience to understand.\n\nDutton's concept of expressive authenticity is based on the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" alternative definition of \"possessing original or inherent authority\". In this sense, authenticity is a measure of the degree to which the artist's work is a committed, personal expression rather than derived from other work. It includes concepts of originality, honesty and integrity.\nIn the case of a musical performance, authenticity of expression may conflict with authenticity of performance. The player is true to their personal musical sense and does not imitate someone else's method of playing. Their performance may thus differ significantly from that of a player attempting to follow the style common at the time the musical work was composed.\nExpressive authenticity is related to the technical term \"authenticity\" as used in existential philosophy. It has always been thought right to know oneself and to act accordingly, and in existential psychology this form of authenticity is seen as central to mental health.\nProminent artists such as the Abstract Expressionists Jackson Pollock, Arshile Gorky, and Willem de Kooning have been understood in existentialist terms, as have filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godard and Ingmar Bergman.\nThe greater popularity of performer-based music as opposed to composition-based music is relatively recent. It seems to reflect a growing interest in expressive authenticity, and thus in musicians who have a unique and charismatic style.\n\nThe question of whether an artistic work is an authentic expression depends on the artist's background, beliefs and ideals. Andrew Potter cites the example of Avril Lavigne, a teenage singer from Napanee, Ontario who burst onto the pop music scene in 2002. She claimed to be a small-town skateboarder, with her background providing the subjects of her songs, and said these songs were her own compositions. These claims of authenticity of expression and of provenance were both challenged. However, her work could have been authentic in expression even if Lavigne had not written it, or authentic in provenance if she had written it but not authentic in expression if the carefully cultivated skater-girl image were false.\nAuthenticity of expression may thus be linked with authenticity of style or tradition.\nMany feel it is not permissible for someone to speak in the voice of another culture or racial background, and that such an expression cannot be authentic.\nFor example, hip hop was originally an art form through which underprivileged minorities in the United States protested against their condition. As it has become less of an underground culture, there is debate over whether the spirit of hip hop can survive in a marketable integrated version.\nIn \"Authenticity Within Hip Hop and Other Cultures Threatened with Assimilation,\" Kembrew McLeod argues that hip hop culture is threatened with assimilation by a larger, mainstream culture, and that authenticity of expression in this genre is being lost.\n\nA quite different concern is the authenticity of the experience, which may be impossible to achieve. A modern visitor to a museum may not only see an object in a very different context from that which the artist intended, but also may be unable to understand important aspects of the work. The authentic experience may be impossible to recapture. A curator may accept this, perhaps attempting to present the works of art in their authentic condition, but accepting that the artificial setting and lighting are legitimate in providing a contemporary experience of the artwork, even if this experience cannot be \"authentic\".\n\nDutton discusses the importance of the audience, giving a hypothetical example based on \"La Scala\", the famous Milan opera house. He imagines that the natural audience, informed aficionados of the opera, lose interest and cease to attend, but the performances continue to be given to tourists who have no understanding of the work they are experiencing. In another example, he quotes a Pacific Island dancer saying \"Culture? That's what we do for the tourists.\" In both cases, although the performances may be authentic in the sense of being true to the original, the authenticity of the experience is open to debate.\n\n\n"}

Another popular \"bento\" style is \"oekakiben\"\" or \"picture \"bento\". This is decorated to look like people, animals, buildings and monuments, or items such as flowers and plants. Contests are often held where \"bento\" arrangers compete for the most aesthetically pleasing arrangements.\n\nThere are similar forms of boxed lunches in Asian countries including the Philippines (\"baon\"), Korea (\"dosirak\"), Taiwan (\"biàn dāng\" in Mandarin and “piān-tong” in Taiwanese) and India (tiffin). Also, Hawaiian culture has adopted localized versions of \"bento\" featuring local tastes after over a century of Japanese influence in the islands.\n\nIn Japan, \"bento\"\" is written as . The word originates from the Southern Song slang term ( ()), meaning \"convenient\" or \"convenience.\" When imported to Japan, it was written with the ateji and .\n\nIn Japan, the word \"\"bento\" has been used since the 13th century, and the container itself, also called \"bento\",\" has been since the 16th century.\n\nIn modern times, bento is commonly used in Western countries and East Asia. In mainland China and Taiwan, \"bento\" is written as ().\n\nThe origin of \"bento\" can be traced back to the late Kamakura period (1185 to 1333), when cooked and dried rice called \"hoshi-ii\" ( or , literally \"dried meal\") was developed, to be carried to work. \"Hoshi-ii\" can be eaten as is or boiled with water to make cooked rice, and is stored in a small bag. In the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568–1600), wooden lacquered boxes like today's were produced, and \"bento\" would be eaten during a \"hanami\" or a tea party.\n\nIn the Edo period (1603–1867), \"bento\" culture spread and became more refined. Travelers and sightseers would carry a simple \"koshibentō\" (, \"waist \"bento\"\"), consisting of several \"onigiri\" wrapped with bamboo leaves or in a woven bamboo box. One of the most popular styles of \"bento\", called \"makuno-uchi bentō\" (\"between-act \"bento\"\"), was first made during this period. People who came to see \"Noh\" and Kabuki ate specially prepared \"bentos\" between \"maku\" (acts). Numerous cookbooks were published detailing how to cook, how to pack, and what to prepare for occasions like \"Hanami\" and \"Hinamatsuri\".\n\nIn the Meiji period (1868–1912), the first \"ekibentō\" or \"ekiben\" ( or , \"train station \"bento\"\") was sold. There are several records that claim where \"ekiben\" was first sold, but it is believed that it was sold on 16 July 1885, at the Utsunomiya train station, in the northern Kantō region of Japan, and contained two \"onigiri\" and a serving of \"takuan\" wrapped in bamboo leaves. As early schools did not provide lunch, students and teachers carried \"bentos\", as did many employees. \"European\" style \"bentos\" with sandwiches also went on sale during this period.\n\nIn the Taishō period (1912–1926), the aluminum \"bento\" box became a luxury item because of its ease of cleaning and its silver-like appearance. Also, a move to abolish the practice of \"bento\" in school became a social issue. Disparities in wealth spread during this period, following an export boom during World War I and subsequent crop failures in the Tohoku region. A \"bento\" too often reflected a student's wealth, and many wondered if this had an unfavorable influence on children both physically, from lack of adequate diet, and psychologically, from a clumsily made \"bento\" or the richness of food. After World War II, the practice of bringing \"bentos\" to school gradually declined and was replaced by uniform food provided for all students and teachers.\n\"Bentos\" regained popularity in the 1980s, with the help of the microwave oven and the proliferation of convenience stores. In addition, the expensive wood and metal boxes have been replaced at most \"bento\" shops with inexpensive, disposable polystyrene boxes. However, even handmade \"bentos\" have made a comeback, and they are once again a common, although not universal, sight at Japanese schools. \"Bentos\" are still used by workers as a packed lunch, by families on day trips, for school picnics and sports days etc. The \"bento\", made at home, is wrapped in a \"furoshiki\" cloth, which acts as both bag and table mat.\n\nAirports also offer an analogous version of the \"ekiben\": a bento filled with local cuisine, to be eaten while waiting for an airplane or during the flight.\n\nThe \"bento\" made its way to Taiwan in the first half of the 20th century from Japan and remains very popular to the present day. The Japanese name was borrowed as \"bendong\" (Taiwanese: \"piān-tong\") or Mandarin \"biàndāng\" (便當).\n\nIn Japan, it is common for mothers to make \"bento\" for their children to take to school. Because making \"bento\" can take a while, some mothers will prepare the ingredients the night before and pack everything the following morning before their children go to school.\n\nIt is often a social expectation of mothers to provide bento for their children, to create both a nutritionally balanced and aesthetically pleasing meal. This activity is expected of the mother and emphasised by society at large, and is common in nursery school institutions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Three of the cardinal virtues are personified as statuesque women seated in a bucolic landscape and the theological virtues are depicted by putti. The fresco was a part of Raphael's commission to decorate the private apartments of Pope Julius II. These rooms are now known as the Stanze di Raffaello. After completing his three monumental frescoes \"Disputation of the Holy Sacrament\", \"The Parnassus\", and \"The School of Athens\" in the Stanza della Segnatura, Raphael painted the \"Cardinal and Theological Virtues\" in 1511.\n\nThe walls containing frescoes in the \"Stanza della Segnatura\" depict four branches of human knowledge: Philosophy (\"School of Athens\"), Religion (\"Disputation\"), Poetry (\"Parnassus\"), and Law (\"Virtues\"). The fourth wall containing the \"Virtues\" addresses both the civil law of the secular state and the canon law of the Church. Accordingly, three classical cardinal virtues (Fortitude, Prudence and Temperance) are attended by five putti, three of whom depict the theological virtues of Charity, Hope, and Faith.\n\nOn the left, Raphael painted Fortitude. Armor-clad, she caresses a lion with her left hand while grasping a sapling of black oak with her right. The oak tree symbolizes strength and alludes to the Della Rovere family to which Pope Julius II belonged. A putto representing Charity harvests acorns from the oak branch. Fortitude's seated posture and the folds of her clothing are copied directly from a modello Raphael had seen of Michelangelo's \"Moses\".\n\nProminently seated in the center is Prudence. On her breast is an effigy of a winged Gorgon to ward off deceit and fraud. Janus-like, her head has two faces shown in profile. Her youthful feminine face looks forward into a mirror. This is an allegory of wisdom and knowledge of the present. The backward-facing visage of the old man peers into a past for sound judgment predicated on experience. His view is enhanced by the flaming torch held by a putto depicting Hope.\n\nTemperance sits on the right. She holds the bridle of restraint and is accompanied by a putto portraying Faith who points upward to heaven with his right hand.\n\nThe fourth cardinal virtue, Justice, isn't included in the scene. Instead, she is depicted holding scales and a sword in a tondo on the ceiling directly above the fresco. The more prominent position of Justice is explained by the emphasis Plato placed on this fourth virtue. He introduced it to ensure the other three cardinal virtues existed in harmony.\n\nThe other two frescoes found lower on the wall also portray scenes concerning the law. To the left of the window is a fresco designed by Raphael but executed by his studio. It depicts the Emperor Justinian receiving the civil code known as the Pandects of the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" from Tribonian. To the right of the window, Pope Gregory IX (as portrayed by Julius II) receives the code of canon law known as the \"Decretals\" from Raymond of Penyafort.\n"}
{"id": "82991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=82991", "title": "Chamber music", "text": "Chamber music\n\nChamber music is a form of classical music that is composed for a small group of instruments—traditionally a group that could fit in a palace chamber or a large room. Most broadly, it includes any art music that is performed by a small number of performers, with one performer to a part (in contrast to orchestral music, in which each string part is played by a number of performers). However, by convention, it usually does not include solo instrument performances.\n\nBecause of its intimate nature, chamber music has been described as \"the music of friends\". For more than 100 years, chamber music was played primarily by amateur musicians in their homes, and even today, when chamber music performance has migrated from the home to the concert hall, many musicians, amateur and professional, still play chamber music for their own pleasure. Playing chamber music requires special skills, both musical and social, that differ from the skills required for playing solo or symphonic works.\n\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe described chamber music (specifically, string quartet music) as \"four rational people conversing\". This conversational paradigm–which refers to the way one instrument introduces a melody or motif and then other instruments subsequently \"respond\" with a similar motif–has been a thread woven through the history of chamber music composition from the end of the 18th century to the present. The analogy to conversation recurs in descriptions and analyses of chamber music compositions.\n\nFrom its earliest beginnings in the Medieval period to the present, chamber music has been a reflection of the changes in the technology and the society that produced it.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages and the early Renaissance, instruments were used primarily as accompaniment for singers. String players would play along with the melody line sung by the singer. There were also purely instrumental ensembles, often of stringed precursors of the violin family, called consorts.\n\nSome analysts consider the origin of classical instrumental ensembles to be the sonata da camera (chamber sonata) and the sonata da chiesa (church sonata). These were compositions for one to five or more instruments. The sonata da camera was a suite of slow and fast movements, interspersed with dance tunes; the sonata da chiesa was the same, but the dances were omitted. These forms gradually developed into the trio sonata of the Baroque – two treble instruments and a bass instrument, often with a keyboard or other chording instrument (harpsichord, organ, harp or lute, for example) filling in the harmony. Both the bass instrument and the chordal instrument would play the basso continuo part.\n\nDuring the Baroque period, chamber music as a genre was not clearly defined. Often, works could be played on any variety of instruments, in orchestral or chamber ensembles. \"The Art of Fugue\" by Johann Sebastian Bach, for example, can be played on a keyboard instrument (harpsichord or organ) or by a string quartet or a string orchestra. The instrumentation of trio sonatas was also often flexibly specified; some of Handel's sonatas are scored for \"German flute, Hoboy [oboe] or Violin\" Bass lines could be played by violone, cello, theorbo, or bassoon, and sometimes three or four instruments would join in the bass line in unison. Sometimes composers mixed movements for chamber ensembles with orchestral movements. Telemann's 'Tafelmusik' (1733), for example, has five sets of movements for various combinations of instruments, ending with a full orchestral section.\nBaroque chamber music was often contrapuntal; that is, each instrument played the same melodic materials at different times, creating a complex, interwoven fabric of sound. Because each instrument was playing essentially the same melodies, all the instruments were equal. In the trio sonata, there is often no ascendent or solo instrument, but all three instruments share equal importance.\nThe harmonic role played by the keyboard or other chording instrument was subsidiary, and usually the keyboard part was not even written out; rather, the chordal structure of the piece was specified by numeric codes over the bass line, called figured bass.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, tastes began to change: many composers preferred a new, lighter Galant style, with \"thinner texture, ... and clearly defined melody and bass\" to the complexities of counterpoint. Now a new custom arose that gave birth to a new form of chamber music: the serenade. Patrons invited street musicians to play evening concerts below the balconies of their homes, their friends and their lovers. Patrons and musicians commissioned composers to write suitable suites of dances and tunes, for groups of two to five or six players. These works were called serenades (sera=night), nocturnes, divertimenti, or cassations (from gasse=street). The young Joseph Haydn was commissioned to write several of these.\n\nJoseph Haydn is generally credited with creating the modern form of chamber music as we know it. In 83 string quartets, 45 piano trios, and numerous string trios, duos and wind ensembles, Haydn established the conversational style of composition and the overall form that was to dominate the world of chamber music for the next two centuries.\nAn example of the conversational mode of composition is Haydn's string quartet Op. 20, No. 4 in D major. In the first movement, after a statement of the main theme by all the instruments, the first violin breaks into a triplet figure, supported by the second violin, viola and cello. The cello answers with its own triplet figure, then the viola, while the other instruments play a secondary theme against this movement. Unlike counterpoint, where each part plays essentially the same melodic role as the others, here each instrument contributes its own character, its own comment on the music as it develops.\nHaydn also settled on an overall form for his chamber music compositions, which would become the standard, with slight variations, to the present day. The characteristic Haydn string quartet has four movements:\n\n\nHis innovations earned Haydn the title \"father of the string quartet\", and he was recognized by his contemporaries as the leading composer of his time. But he was by no means the only composer developing new modes of chamber music. Even before Haydn, many composers were already experimenting with new forms. Giovanni Battista Sammartini, Ignaz Holzbauer, and Franz Xaver Richter wrote precursors of the string quartet.\nIf Haydn created the conversational style of composition, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart greatly expanded its vocabulary. His chamber music added numerous masterpieces to the chamber music repertoire. Mozart's seven piano trios and two piano quartets were the first to apply the conversational principle to chamber music with piano. Haydn's piano trios are essentially piano sonatas with the violin and cello playing mostly supporting roles, doubling the treble and bass lines of the piano score. But Mozart gives the strings an independent role, using them as a counter to the piano, and adding their individual voices to the chamber music conversation.\nMozart introduced the newly invented clarinet into the chamber music arsenal, with the Kegelstatt Trio for viola, clarinet and piano, K. 498, and the Quintet for Clarinet and String Quartet, K. 581. He also tried other innovative ensembles, including the quintet for violin, two violas, cello, and horn, K. 407, quartets for flute and strings, and various wind instrument combinations. He wrote six string quintets for two violins, two violas and cello, which explore the rich tenor tones of the violas, adding a new dimension to the string quartet conversation.\n\nMozart's string quartets are considered the pinnacle of the classical art. The six string quartets that he dedicated to Haydn, his friend and mentor, inspired the elder composer to say to Mozart's father, \"I tell you before God as an honest man that your son is the greatest composer known to me either in person or by reputation. He has taste, and, what is more, the most profound knowledge of composition.\"\n\nMany other composers wrote chamber compositions during this period that were popular at the time and are still played today. Luigi Boccherini, Italian composer and cellist, wrote nearly a hundred string quartets, and more than one hundred quintets for two violins, viola and two cellos. In this innovative ensemble, later used by Schubert, Boccherini gives flashy, virtuosic solos to the principal cello, as a showcase for his own playing. Violinist Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf and cellist Johann Baptist Wanhal, who both played pickup quartets with Haydn on second violin and Mozart on viola, were popular chamber music composers of the period.\n\nThe turn of the 19th century saw dramatic changes in society and in music technology which had far-reaching effects on the way chamber music was composed and played.\n\nThroughout the 18th century, the composer was normally an employee of an aristocrat, and the chamber music he or she composed was for the pleasure of aristocratic players and listeners. Haydn, for example, was an employee of Nikolaus I, Prince Esterházy, a music lover and amateur baryton player, for whom Haydn wrote many of his string trios. Mozart wrote three string quartets for the King of Prussia, Frederick William II, a cellist. Many of Beethoven's quartets were first performed with patron Count Andrey Razumovsky on second violin. Boccherini composed for the king of Spain.\n\nWith the bankruptcy of the aristocracy and new social orders throughout Europe, composers increasingly had to make money by selling their compositions and performing concerts. They often gave subscription concerts, which involved renting a hall and collecting the receipts from the performance. Increasingly, they wrote chamber music not only for rich patrons, but for professional musicians playing for a paying audience.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, luthiers developed new methods of constructing the violin, viola and cello that gave these instruments a richer tone, more volume, and more carrying power. Also at this time, bowmakers made the violin bow longer, with a thicker ribbon of hair under higher tension. This improved projection, and also made possible new bowing techniques. In 1820, Louis Spohr invented the chinrest, which gave violinists more freedom of movement in their left hands, for a more nimble technique. These changes contributed to the effectiveness of public performances in large halls, and expanded the repertoire of techniques available to chamber music composers.\n\nThroughout the Baroque era, the harpsichord was one of the main instruments used in chamber music. The harpsichord used quills to pluck strings, and it had a delicate sound. Due to the design of the harpsichord, the attack or weight with which the performer played the keyboard did not change the volume or tone. In between about 1750 and the late 1700s, the harpsichord gradually fell out of use. By the late 1700s, the pianoforte became more popular as an instrument for performance. Even though the pianoforte was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori at the beginning of the 1700s, it did not become widely used until the end of that century, when technical improvements in its construction made it a more effective instrument. Unlike the harpsichord, the pianoforte could play soft or loud dynamics and sharp sforzando attacks depending on how hard or soft the performer played the keys. The improved pianoforte was adopted by Mozart and other composers, who began composing chamber ensembles with the piano playing a leading role. The piano was to become more and more dominant through the 19th century, so much so that many composers, such as Franz Liszt and Frédéric Chopin, wrote almost exclusively for solo piano (or solo piano with orchestra).\n\nLudwig van Beethoven straddled this period of change as a giant of Western music. Beethoven transformed chamber music, raising it to a new plane, both in terms of content and in terms of the technical demands on performers and audiences. His works, in the words of Maynard Solomon, were \"...the models against which nineteenth-century romanticism measured its achievements and failures.\" His late quartets, in particular, were considered so daunting an accomplishment that many composers after him were afraid to try composing quartets; Johannes Brahms composed and tore up 20 string quartets before he dared publish a work that he felt was worthy of the \"giant marching behind\".\nBeethoven made his formal debut as a composer with three Piano Trios, Op. 1. Even these early works, written when Beethoven was only 22, while adhering to a strictly classical mold, showed signs of the new paths that Beethoven was to forge in the coming years. When he showed the manuscript of the trios to Haydn, his teacher, prior to publication, Haydn approved of the first two, but warned against publishing the third trio, in C minor, as too radical, warning it would not \"...be understood and favorably received by the public.\"\n\nHaydn was wrong—the third trio was the most popular of the set, and Haydn's criticisms caused a falling-out between him and the sensitive Beethoven. The trio is, indeed, a departure from the mold that Haydn and Mozart had formed. Beethoven makes dramatic deviations of tempo within phrases and within movements. He greatly increases the independence of the strings, especially the cello, allowing it to range above the piano and occasionally even the violin.\n\nIf his Op. 1 trios introduced Beethoven's works to the public, his Septet, Op. 20, established him as one of Europe's most popular composers. The septet, scored for violin, viola, cello, contrabass, clarinet, horn, and bassoon, was a huge hit. It was played in concerts again and again. It appeared in transcriptions for many combinations – one of which, for clarinet, cello and piano, was written by Beethoven himself – and was so popular that Beethoven feared it would eclipse his other works. So much so that by 1815, Carl Czerny wrote that Beethoven \"could not endure his septet and grew angry because of the universal applause which it has received.\" The septet is written as a classical divertimento in six movements, including two minuets, and a set of variations. It is full of catchy tunes, with solos for everyone, including the contrabass.\n\nIn his 17 string quartets, composed over the course of 37 of his 56 years, Beethoven goes from classical composer par excellence to creator of musical Romanticism, and finally, with his late string quartets, he transcends classicism and romanticism to create a genre that defies categorization. Stravinsky referred to the Große Fuge, of the late quartets, as, \"...this absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever.\"\n\nThe string quartets 1–6, Op. 18, were written in the classical style, in the same year that Haydn wrote his Op. 76 string quartets. Even here, Beethoven stretched the formal structures pioneered by Haydn and Mozart. In the quartet Op. 18, No. 1, in F major, for example, there is a long, lyrical solo for cello in the second movement, giving the cello a new type of voice in the quartet conversation. And the last movement of Op. 18, No. 6, \"La Malincolia\", creates a new type of formal structure, interleaving a slow, melancholic section with a manic dance. Beethoven was to use this form in later quartets, and Brahms and others adopted it as well.\nIn the years 1805 to 1806, Beethoven composed the three Op. 59 quartets on a commission from Count Razumovsky, who played second violin in their first performance. These quartets, from Beethoven's middle period, were pioneers in the romantic style. Besides introducing many structural and stylistic innovations, these quartets were much more difficult technically to perform – so much so that they were, and remain, beyond the reach of many amateur string players. When first violinist Ignaz Schuppanzigh complained of their difficulty, Beethoven retorted, \"Do you think I care about your wretched violin when the spirit moves me?\" Among the difficulties are complex syncopations and cross-rhythms; synchronized runs of sixteenth, thirty-second, and sixty-fourth notes; and sudden modulations requiring special attention to intonation. In addition to the Op. 59 quartets, Beethoven wrote two more quartets during his middle period – Op. 74, the \"Harp\" quartet, named for the unusual harp-like effect Beethoven creates with pizzicato passages in the first movement, and Op. 95, the \"Serioso\".\nThe Serioso is a transitional work that ushers in Beethoven's late period – a period of compositions of great introspection. \"The particular kind of inwardness of Beethoven's last style period\", writes Joseph Kerman, gives one the feeling that \"the music is sounding only for the composer and for one other auditor, an awestruck eavesdropper: you.\" In the late quartets, the quartet conversation is often disjointed, proceeding like a stream of consciousness. Melodies are broken off, or passed in the middle of the melodic line from instrument to instrument. Beethoven uses new effects, never before essayed in the string quartet literature: the ethereal, dreamlike effect of open intervals between the high E string and the open A string in the second movement of quartet Op. 132; the use of \"sul ponticello\" (playing on the bridge of the violin) for a brittle, scratchy sound in the Presto movement of Op. 131; the use of the Lydian mode, rarely heard in Western music for 200 years, in Op. 132; a cello melody played high above all the other strings in the finale of Op. 132. Yet for all this disjointedness, each quartet is tightly designed, with an overarching structure that ties the work together.\n\nBeethoven wrote eight piano trios, five string trios, two string quintets, and numerous pieces for wind ensemble. He also wrote ten sonatas for violin and piano and five sonatas for cello and piano.\n\nAs Beethoven, in his last quartets, went off in his own direction, Franz Schubert carried on and established the emerging romantic style. In his 31 years, Schubert devoted much of his life to chamber music, composing 15 string quartets, two piano trios, string trios, a piano quintet commonly known as the \"Trout Quintet\", an octet for strings and winds, and his famous quintet for two violins, viola, and two cellos.\n\nSchubert's music, as his life, exemplified the contrasts and contradictions of his time. On the one hand, he was the darling of Viennese society: he starred in soirées that became known as \"Schubertiaden\", where he played his light, mannered compositions that expressed the gemütlichkeit of Vienna of the 1820s. On the other hand, his own short life was shrouded in tragedy, wracked by poverty and ill health. Chamber music was the ideal medium to express this conflict, \"to reconcile his essentially lyric themes with his feeling for dramatic utterance within a form that provided the possibility of extreme color contrasts.\" The String Quintet in C, D.956, is an example of how this conflict is expressed in music. After a slow introduction, the first theme of the first movement, fiery and dramatic, leads to a bridge of rising tension, peaking suddenly and breaking into the second theme, a lilting duet in the lower voices. The alternating Sturm und Drang and relaxation continue throughout the movement.\n\nThese contending forces are expressed in some of Schubert's other works: in the quartet Death and the Maiden, the Rosamunde quartet and in the stormy, one-movement Quartettsatz, D. 703.\n\nUnlike Schubert, Felix Mendelssohn had a life of peace and prosperity. Born into a wealthy Jewish family in Hamburg, Mendelssohn proved himself a child prodigy. By the age of 16, he had written his first major chamber work, the String Octet, Op. 20. Already in this work, Mendelssohn showed some of the unique style that was to characterize his later works; notably, the gossamer light texture of his scherzo movements, exemplified also by the \"Canzonetta\" movement of the String Quartet, Op. 12, and the scherzo of the Piano Trio No. 1 in D minor, Op. 49.\n\nAnother characteristic that Mendelssohn pioneered is the cyclic form in overall structure. This means the reuse of thematic material from one movement to the next, to give the total piece coherence. In his second string quartet, he opens the piece with a peaceful adagio section in A major, that contrasts with the stormy first movement in A minor. After the final, vigorous Presto movement, he returns to the opening adagio to conclude the piece. This string quartet is also Mendelssohn's homage to Beethoven; the work is studded with quotes from Beethoven's middle and late quartets.\nDuring his adult life, Mendelssohn wrote two piano trios, seven works for string quartet, two string quintets, the octet, a sextet for piano and strings, and numerous sonatas for piano with violin, cello, and clarinet.\nRobert Schumann continued the development of cyclic structure. In his Piano Quintet in E flat, Op. 44, Schumann wrote a double fugue in the finale, using the theme of the first movement and the theme of the last movement. Both Schumann and Mendelssohn, following the example set by Beethoven, revived the fugue, which had fallen out of favor since the Baroque period. However, rather than writing strict, full-length fugues, they used counterpoint as another mode of conversation between the chamber music instruments. Many of Schumann's chamber works, including all three of his string quartets and his piano quartet have contrapuntal sections interwoven seamlessly into the overall compositional texture.\n\nThe composers of the first half of the 19th century were acutely aware of the conversational paradigm established by Haydn and Mozart. Schumann wrote that in a true quartet \"everyone has something to say ... a conversation, often truly beautiful, often oddly and turbidly woven, among four people.\" Their awareness is exemplified by composer and virtuoso violinist Louis Spohr. Spohr divided his 36 string quartets into two types: the \"quatuor brillant\", essentially a violin concerto with string trio accompaniment; and \"quatuor dialogue\", in the conversational tradition.\n\nThe middle of the 19th century saw more changes in society and in musical tastes, which had their impact on chamber music composition and performance. While improvements in instruments led to more public performances of chamber music, it remained very much a type of music to be played as much as performed. Amateur quartet societies sprang up throughout Europe, and no middling-sized city in Germany or France would be without one. These societies sponsored house concerts, compiled music libraries, and encouraged the playing of quartets and other ensembles.\n\nThousands of quartets were published by hundreds of composers; between 1770 and 1800, more than 2000 quartets were published, and the pace did not decline in the next century. Throughout the 19th century, composers published string quartets now long neglected: George Onslow wrote 36 quartets and 35 quintets; Gaetano Donizetti wrote dozens of quartets, Antonio Bazzini, Anton Reicha, Carl Reissiger, Joseph Suk and others wrote to fill an insatiable demand for quartets. In addition, there was a lively market for string quartet arrangements of popular and folk tunes, piano works, symphonies, and opera arias.\n\nBut opposing forces were at work. The middle of the 19th century saw the rise of superstar virtuosi, who drew attention away from chamber music toward solo performance. Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt presented \"recitals\" – a term coined by Liszt – that drew crowds of ecstatic fans who swooned at the sound of their playing. The piano, which could be mass-produced, became an instrument of preference, and many composers, like Chopin and Liszt, composed primarily if not exclusively for piano.\nThe ascendance of the piano, and of symphonic composition, was not merely a matter of preference; it was also a matter of ideology. In the 1860s, a schism grew among romantic musicians over the direction of music. Liszt and Richard Wagner led a movement that contended that \"pure music\" had run its course with Beethoven, and that new, programmatic forms of music–in which music created \"images\" with its melodies–were the future of the art. The composers of this school had no use for chamber music. Opposing this view was Johannes Brahms and his associates, especially the powerful music critic Eduard Hanslick. This War of the Romantics shook the artistic world of the period, with vituperative exchanges between the two camps, concert boycotts, and petitions.\n\nAlthough amateur playing thrived throughout the 19th century, this was also a period of increasing professionalization of chamber music performance. Professional quartets began to dominate the chamber music concert stage. The Hellmesberger Quartet, led by Joseph Hellmesberger, and the Joachim Quartet, led by Joseph Joachim, debuted many of the new string quartets by Brahms and other composers. Another famous quartet player was Vilemina Norman Neruda, also known as Lady Hallé. Indeed, during the last third of the century, women performers began taking their place on the concert stage: an all-women string quartet led by Emily Shinner, and the Lucas quartet, also all women, were two notable examples.\n\nIt was Johannes Brahms who carried the torch of Romantic music toward the 20th century. Heralded by Robert Schumann as the forger of \"new paths\" in music, Brahms's music is a bridge from the classical to the modern. On the one hand, Brahms was a traditionalist, conserving the musical traditions of Bach and Mozart. Throughout his chamber music, he uses traditional techniques of counterpoint, incorporating fugues and canons into rich conversational and harmonic textures. On the other hand, Brahms expanded the structure and the harmonic vocabulary of chamber music, challenging traditional notions of tonality. An example of this is in the Brahms second string sextet, Op. 36.\n\nTraditionally, composers wrote the first theme of a piece in the key of the piece, firmly establishing that key as the tonic, or home, key of the piece. The opening theme of Op. 36 starts in the tonic (G major), but already by the third measure has modulated to the unrelated key of E-flat major. As the theme develops, it ranges through various keys before coming back to the tonic G major. This \"harmonic audacity\", as Swafford describes it, opened the way for bolder experiments to come.\n\nNot only in harmony, but also in overall musical structure, Brahms was an innovator. He developed a technique that Arnold Schoenberg described as \"developing variation\". Rather than discretely defined phrases, Brahms often runs phrase into phrase, and mixes melodic motives to create a fabric of continuous melody. Schoenberg, the creator of the 12-tone system of composition, traced the roots of his modernism to Brahms, in his essay \"Brahms the Progressive\".\n\nAll told, Brahms published 24 works of chamber music, including three string quartets, five piano trios, the quintet for piano and strings, Op. 34, and other works. Among his last works were the clarinet quintet, Op. 115, and a trio for clarinet, cello and piano. He wrote a trio for the unusual combination of piano, violin and horn, Op. 40. He also wrote two songs for alto singer, viola and piano, Op. 91, reviving the form of voice with string obbligato that had been virtually abandoned since the Baroque.\nThe exploration of tonality and of structure begun by Brahms was continued by composers of the French school. César Franck's piano quintet in F minor, composed in 1879, further established the cyclic form first explored by Schumann and Mendelssohn, reusing the same thematic material in each of the three movements. Claude Debussy's string quartet, Op. 10, is considered a watershed in the history of chamber music. The quartet uses the cyclic structure, and constitutes a final divorce from the rules of classical harmony. \"Any sounds in any combination and in any succession are henceforth free to be used in a musical continuity\", Debussy wrote. Pierre Boulez said that Debussy freed chamber music from \"rigid structure, frozen rhetoric and rigid aesthetics\".\nDebussy's quartet, like the string quartets of Maurice Ravel and of Gabriel Fauré, created a new tone color for chamber music, a color and texture associated with the Impressionist movement. Violist James Dunham, of the Cleveland and Sequoia Quartets, writes of the Ravel quartet, \"I was simply overwhelmed by the sweep of sonority, the sensation of colors constantly changing ...\" For these composers, chamber ensembles were the ideal vehicle for transmitting this atmospheric sense, and chamber works constituted much of their oeuvre.\n\nParallel with the trend to seek new modes of tonality and texture was another new development in chamber music: the rise of nationalism. Composers turned more and more to the rhythms and tonalities of their native lands for inspiration and material. \"Europe was impelled by the Romantic tendency to establish in musical matters the national boundaries more and more sharply\", wrote Alfred Einstein. \"The collecting and sifting of old traditional melodic treasures ... formed the basis for a creative art-music.\" For many of these composers, chamber music was the natural vehicle for expressing their national characters.\nCzech composer Antonín Dvořák created in his chamber music a new voice for the music of his native Bohemia. In 14 string quartets, three string quintets, two piano quartets, a string sextet, four piano trios, and numerous other chamber compositions, Dvořák incorporates folk music and modes as an integral part of his compositions. For example, in the piano quintet in A major, Op. 81, the slow movement is a Dumka, a Slavic folk ballad that alternates between a slow expressive song and a fast dance. Dvořák's fame in establishing a national art music was so great that the New York philanthropist and music connoisseur Jeannette Thurber invited him to America, to head a conservatory that would establish an American style of music. There, Dvořák wrote his string quartet in F major, Op. 96, nicknamed \"The American\". While composing the work, Dvořák was entertained by a group of Kickapoo Indians who performed native dances and songs, and these songs may have been incorporated in the quartet.\n\nBedřich Smetana, another Czech, wrote a piano trio and string quartet, both of which incorporate native Czech rhythms and melodies. In Russia, Russian folk music permeated the works of the late 19th-century composers. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky uses a typical Russian folk dance in the final movement of his string sextet, \"Souvenir de Florence\", Op. 70. Alexander Borodin's second string quartet contains references to folk music, and the slow Nocturne movement of that quartet recalls Middle Eastern modes that were current in the Muslim sections of southern Russia. Edvard Grieg used the musical style of his native Norway in his string quartet in G minor, Op. 27 and his violin sonatas.\n\nIn Hungary, composers Zoltán Kodály and Béla Bartók pioneered the science of ethnomusicology by performing one of the first comprehensive studies of folk music. Ranging across the Magyar provinces, they transcribed, recorded, and classified tens of thousands of folk melodies. They used these tunes in their compositions, which are characterized by the asymmetrical rhythms and modal harmonies of that music. Their chamber music compositions, and those of the Czech composer Leoš Janáček, combined the nationalist trend with the 20th century search for new tonalities. Janáček's string quartets not only incorporate the tonalities of Czech folk music, they also reflect the rhythms of speech in the Czech language.\n\nThe end of western tonality, begun subtly by Brahms and made explicit by Debussy, posed a crisis for composers of the 20th century. It was not merely an issue of finding new types of harmonies and melodic systems to replace the diatonic scale that was the basis of western harmony; the whole structure of western music – the relationships between movements and between structural elements within movements – was based on the relationships between different keys. So composers were challenged with building a whole new structure for music.\n\nThis was coupled with the feeling that the era that saw the invention of automobiles, the telephone, electric lighting, and world war needed new modes of expression. \"The century of the aeroplane deserves its music\", wrote Debussy.\n\nThe search for a new music took several directions. The first, led by Bartók, was toward the tonal and rhythmic constructs of folk music. Bartók's research into Hungarian and other eastern European and Middle Eastern folk music revealed to him a musical world built of musical scales that were neither major nor minor, and complex rhythms that were alien to the concert hall. In his fifth quartet, for example, Bartók uses a time signature of formula_1, \"startling to the classically-trained musician, but second-nature to the folk musician.\" Structurally, also, Bartók often invents or borrows from folk modes. In the sixth string quartet, for example, Bartók begins each movement with a slow, elegiac melody, followed by the main melodic material of the movement, and concludes the quartet with a slow movement that is built entirely on this elegy. This is a form common in many folk music cultures.\nBartók's six string quartets are often compared with Beethoven's late quartets. In them, Bartók builds new musical structures, explores sonorities never previously produced in classical music (for example, the snap pizzicato, where the player lifts the string and lets it snap back on the fingerboard with an audible buzz), and creates modes of expression that set these works apart from all others. \"Bartók's last two quartets proclaim the sanctity of life, progress and the victory of humanity despite the anti-humanistic dangers of the time\", writes analyst John Herschel Baron. The last quartet, written when Bartók was preparing to flee the Nazi invasion of Hungary for a new and uncertain life in the U.S., is often seen as an autobiographical statement of the tragedy of his times.\n\nBartók was not alone in his explorations of folk music. Igor Stravinsky's \"Three Pieces for String Quartet\" is structured as three Russian folksongs, rather than as a classical string quartet. Stravinsky, like Bartók, used asymmetrical rhythms throughout his chamber music; the Histoire du soldat, in Stravinsky's own arrangement for clarinet, violin and piano, constantly shifts time signatures between two, three, four and five beats to the bar. In Britain, composers Ralph Vaughan Williams, William Walton and Benjamin Britten drew on English folk music for much of their chamber music: Vaughan Williams incorporates folksongs and country fiddling in his first string quartet. American composer Charles Ives wrote music that was distinctly American. Ives gave programmatic titles to much of his chamber music; his first string quartet, for example, is called \"From the Salvation Army\", and quotes American Protestant hymns in several places.\n\nA second direction in the search for a new tonality was twelve-tone serialism. Arnold Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone method of composition as an alternative to the structure provided by the diatonic system. His method entails building a piece using a series of the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, permuting it and superimposing it on itself to create the composition.\nSchoenberg did not arrive immediately at the serial method. His first chamber work, the string sextet Verklärte Nacht, was mostly a late German romantic work, though it was bold in its use of modulations. The first work that was frankly atonal was the second string quartet; the last movement of this quartet, which includes a soprano, has no key signature. Schoenberg further explored atonality with \"Pierrot Lunaire\", for singer, flute or piccolo, clarinet, violin, cello and piano. The singer uses a technique called Sprechstimme, halfway between speech and song.\n\nAfter developing the twelve-tone technique, Schoenberg wrote a number of chamber works, including two more string quartets, a string trio, and a wind quintet. He was followed by a number of other twelve-tone composers, the most prominent of whom were his students Alban Berg, who wrote the \"Lyric Suite\" for string quartet, and Anton Webern, who wrote \"Five Movements for String Quartet\", op. 5.\n\nTwelve-tone technique was not the only new experiment in tonality. Darius Milhaud developed the use of polytonality, that is, music where different instruments play in different keys at the same time. Milhaud wrote 18 string quartets; quartets number 14 and 15 are written so that each can be played by itself, or the two can be played at the same time as an octet. Milhaud also used jazz idioms, as in his \"Suite\" for clarinet, violin and piano.\n\nThe American composer Charles Ives used not only polytonality in his chamber works, but also polymeter. In his first string quartet he writes a section where the first violin and viola play in formula_2 time while the second violin and cello play in formula_3.\n\nThe plethora of directions that music took in the first quarter of the 20th century led to a reaction by many composers. Led by Stravinsky, these composers looked to the music of preclassical Europe for inspiration and stability. While Stravinsky's neoclassical works – such as the \"Double Canon for String Quartet\" – sound contemporary, they are modeled on Baroque and early classical forms – the canon, the fugue, and the Baroque sonata form.\nPaul Hindemith was another neoclassicist. His many chamber works are essentially tonal, though they use many dissonant harmonies. Hindemith wrote seven string quartets and two string trios, among other chamber works. At a time when composers were writing works of increasing complexity, beyond the reach of amateur musicians, Hindemith explicitly recognized the importance of amateur music-making, and intentionally wrote pieces that were within the abilities of nonprofessional players.\nDmitri Shostakovich was one of the most prolific of chamber music composers of the 20th century, writing 15 string quartets, two piano trios, the piano quintet, and numerous other chamber works. Shostakovich's music was for a long time banned in the Soviet Union and Shostakovich himself was in personal danger of deportation to Siberia. His eighth quartet is an autobiographical work, that expresses his deep depression from his ostracization, bordering on suicide: it quotes from previous compositions, and uses the four-note motif DSCH, the composer's initials.\n\nAs the century progressed, many composers created works for small ensembles that, while they formally might be considered chamber music, challenged many of the fundamental characteristics that had defined the genre over the last 150 years.\n\nThe idea of composing music that could be played at home has been largely abandoned. Bartók was among the first to part with this idea. \"Bartók never conceived these quartets for private performance but rather for large, public concerts.\" Aside from the many almost insurmountable technical difficulties of many modern pieces, some of them are hardly suitable for performance in a small room. For example, \"Different Trains\" by Steve Reich is scored for live string quartet and recorded tape, which layers together a carefully orchestrated sound collage of speech, recorded train sounds, and three string quartets.\n\nSince the invention of electrical telecommunication devices in the 19th century, players of a string quartet can even conduct a conversation when they are flying over the audience in four separate helicopters, as in the \"Helicopter String Quartet\" by Karlheinz Stockhausen. When the piece was performed in 1995, the players had earphones with a click track to enable them to play at the right time.\n\nTraditionally, the composer wrote the notes, and the performer interpreted them. But this is no longer the case in much modern music. In \"Für kommende Zeiten\" (For Times to Come), Stockhausen writes verbal instructions describing what the performers are to play. \"Star constellations/with common points/and falling stars ... Abrupt end\" is a sample.\n\nComposer Terry Riley describes how he works with the Kronos Quartet, an ensemble devoted to contemporary music: \"When I write a score for them, it's an unedited score. I put in just a minimal amount of dynamics and phrasing marks ...we spend a lot of time trying out different ideas in order to shape the music, to form it. At the end of the process, it makes the performers actually \"own\" the music. That to me is the best way for composers and musicians to interact.\"\n\nComposers seek new timbres, remote from the traditional blend of strings, piano and woodwinds that characterized chamber music in the 19th century. This search led to the incorporation of new instruments in the 20th century, such as the theremin and the synthesizer in chamber music compositions.\n\nMany composers sought new timbres within the framework of traditional instruments. \"Composers begin to hear new timbres and new timbral combinations, which are as important to the new music of the twentieth century as the so-called breakdown of functional tonality,\" writes music historian James McCalla. Examples are numerous: Bartók's Sonata for two pianos and percussion (1937), Schoenberg's \"Pierrot lunaire\", Charles Ives's \"Quartertone Pieces\" for two pianos tuned a quartertone apart. Other composers used electronics and extended techniques to create new sonorities. An example is George Crumb's \"Black Angels\", for electric string quartet (1970). The players not only bow their amplified instruments, they also beat on them with thimbles, pluck them with paper clips and play on the wrong side of the bridge or between the fingers and the nut.\n\nWhat do these changes mean for the future of chamber music? \"With the technological advances have come questions of aesthetics and sociological changes in music\", writes analyst Baron. \"These changes have often resulted in accusations that technology has destroyed chamber music and that technological advance is in inverse proportion to musical worth. The ferocity of these attacks only underscores how fundamental these changes are, and only time will tell if humankind will benefit from them.\"\n\nAnalysts agree that the role of chamber music in society has changed profoundly in the last 50 years; yet there is little agreement as to what that change is. On the one hand, Baron contends that \"chamber music in the home ... remained very important in Europe and America until the Second World War, after which the increasing invasion of radio and recording reduced its scope considerably.\" This view is supported by subjective impressions. \"Today there are so many more millions of people listening to music, but far fewer playing chamber music just for the pleasure of it\", says conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim.\nHowever, recent surveys suggest there is, on the contrary, a resurgence of home music making. In the radio program \"Amateurs Help Keep Chamber Music Alive\" from 2005, reporter Theresa Schiavone cites a Gallup poll showing an increase in the sale of stringed instruments in America. Joe Lamond, president of the National Association of Music Manufacturers (NAMM) attributes the increase to a growth of home music-making by adults approaching retirement. \"I would really look to the demographics of the [baby] boomers\", he said in an interview. These people \"are starting to look for something that matters to them ... nothing makes them feel good more than playing music.\"\n\nA study by the European Music Office in 1996 suggests that not only older people are playing music. \"The number of adolescents today to have done music has almost doubled by comparison with those born before 1960\", the study shows. While most of this growth is in popular music, some is in chamber music and art music, according to the study.\n\nWhile there is no agreement about the number of chamber music players, the opportunities for amateurs to play have certainly grown. The number of chamber music camps and retreats, where amateurs can meet for a weekend or a month to play together, has burgeoned. \"Music for the Love of It\", an organization to promote amateur playing, publishes a directory of music workshops that lists more than 500 workshops in 24 countries for amateurs in 2008 The Associated Chamber Music Players (ACMP) offers a directory of over 5,000 amateur players worldwide who welcome partners for chamber music sessions.\n\nRegardless of whether the number of amateur players has grown or shrunk, the number of chamber music concerts in the west has increased greatly in the last 20 years. Concert halls have largely replaced the home as the venue for concerts. Baron suggests that one of the reasons for this surge is \"the spiraling costs of orchestral concerts and the astronomical fees demanded by famous soloists, which have priced both out of the range of most audiences.\" The repertoire at these concerts is almost universally the classics of the 19th century. However, modern works are increasingly included in programs, and some groups, like the Kronos Quartet, devote themselves almost exclusively to contemporary music and new compositions; and ensembles like the Turtle Island String Quartet, that combine classical, jazz, rock and other styles to create crossover music. Cello Fury and Project Trio offer a new spin to the standard chamber ensemble. Cello Fury consists of three cellists and a drummer and Project Trio includes a flutist, bassist, and cellist.\nSeveral groups such as Classical Revolution and Simple Measures have taken classical chamber music out of the concert hall and into the streets. Simple Measures, a group of chamber musicians in Seattle (Washington, USA), gives concerts in shopping centers, coffee shops, and streetcars. The Providence (Rhode Island, USA) String Quartet has started the \"Storefront Strings\" program, offering impromptu concerts and lessons out of a storefront in one of Providence's poorer neighborhoods. \"What really makes this for me\", said Rajan Krishnaswami, cellist and founder of Simple Measures, \"is the audience reaction ... you really get that audience feedback.\"\n\nChamber music performance is a specialized field, and requires a number of skills not normally required for the performance of symphonic or solo music. Many performers and authors have written about the specialized techniques required for a successful chamber musician. Chamber music playing, writes M.D. Herter Norton, requires that \"individuals ... make a unified whole yet remain individuals. The soloist is a whole unto himself, and in the orchestra individuality is lost in numbers ...\".\n\nMany performers contend that the intimate nature of chamber music playing requires certain personality traits.\n\nDavid Waterman, cellist of the Endellion Quartet, writes that the chamber musician \"needs to balance assertiveness and flexibility.\" Good rapport is essential. Arnold Steinhardt, first violinist of the Guarneri Quartet, notes that many professional quartets suffer from frequent turnover of players. \"Many musicians cannot take the strain of going \"mano a mano\" with the same three people year after year.\"\n\nMrs. Norton, a violinist who studied quartet playing with the Kneisel Quartet at the beginning of the last century, goes so far that players of different parts in a quartet have different personality traits. \"By tradition the first violin is the leader\" but \"this does not mean a relentless predominance.\" The second violinist \"is a little everybody's servant.\" \"The artistic contribution of each member will be measured by his skill in asserting or subduing that individuality which he must possess to be at all interesting.\"\n\n\"For an individual, the problems of interpretation are challenging enough\", writes Waterman, \"but for a quartet grappling with some of the most profound, intimate and heartfelt compositions in the music literature, the communal nature of decision-making is often more testing than the decisions themselves.\"\nThe problem of finding agreement on musical issues is complicated by the fact that each player is playing a different part, that may appear to demand dynamics or gestures contrary to those of other parts in the same passage. Sometimes these differences are even specified in the score – for example, where cross-dynamics are indicated, with one instrument crescendoing while another is getting softer.\n\nOne of the issues that must be settled in rehearsal is who leads the ensemble at each point of the piece. Normally, the first violin leads the ensemble. By leading, this means that the violinist indicates the start of each movement and their tempos by a gesture with her head or bowing hand. However, there are passages that require other instruments to lead. For example, John Dalley, second violinist of the Guarneri Quartet, says, \"We'll often ask [the cellist] to lead in pizzicato passages. A cellist's preparatory motion for pizzicato is larger and slower than that of a violinist.\"\n\nPlayers discuss issues of interpretation in rehearsal; but often, in mid-performance, players do things spontaneously, requiring the other players to respond in real time. \"After twenty years in the [Guarneri] Quartet, I'm happily surprised on occasion to find myself totally wrong about what I think a player will do, or how he'll react in a particular passage\", says violist Michael Tree.\n\nPlaying together constitutes a major challenge to chamber music players. Many compositions pose difficulties in coordination, with figures such as hemiolas, syncopation, fast unison passages and simultaneously sounded notes that form chords that are challenging to play in tune. But beyond the challenge of merely playing together from a rhythmic or intonation perspective is the greater challenge of sounding good together.\n\nTo create a unified chamber music sound – to blend – the players must coordinate the details of their technique. They must decide when to use vibrato and how much. They often need to coordinate their bowing and \"breathing\" between phrases, to ensure a unified sound. They need to agree on special techniques, such as spiccato, sul tasto, sul ponticello, and so on.\n\nBalance refers to the relative volume of each of the instruments. Because chamber music is a conversation, sometimes one instrument must stand out, sometimes another. It is not always a simple matter for members of an ensemble to determine the proper balance while playing; frequently, they require an outside listener, or a recording of their rehearsal, to tell them that the relations between the instruments are correct.\n\nChamber music playing presents special problems of intonation. The piano is tuned using equal temperament, that is, the 12 notes of the scale are spaced exactly equally. This method makes it possible for the piano to play in any key; however, all the intervals except the octave sound very slightly out of tune. String players can play with just intonation, that is, they can play specific intervals (such as fifths) exactly in tune. Moreover, string and wind players can use \"expressive intonation\", changing the pitch of a note to create a musical or dramatic effect. \"String intonation is more expressive and sensitive than equal-tempered piano intonation.\"\n\nHowever, using true and expressive intonation requires careful coordination with the other players, especially when a piece is going through harmonic modulations. \"The difficulty in string quartet intonation is to determine the degree of freedom you have at any given moment\", says Steinhardt.\n\nPlayers of chamber music, both amateur and professional, attest to a unique enchantment with playing in ensemble. \"It is not an exaggeration to say that there opened out before me an enchanted world\", writes Walter Willson Cobbett, devoted amateur musician and editor of \"Cobbett's Cyclopedic Survey of Chamber Music\".\n\nEnsembles develop a close intimacy of shared musical experience. \"It is on the concert stage where the moments of true intimacy occur\", writes Steinhardt. \"When a performance is in progress, all four of us together enter a zone of magic somewhere between our music stands and become a conduit, messenger, and missionary ... It is an experience too personal to talk about and yet it colors every aspect of our relationship, every good-natured musical confrontation, all the professional gossip, the latest viola joke.\"\n\nThe playing of chamber music has been the inspiration for numerous books, both fiction and nonfiction. \"An Equal Music\" by Vikram Seth, explores the life and love of the second violinist of a fictional quartet, the Maggiore. Central to the story is the tensions and the intimacy developed between the four members of the quartet. \"A strange composite being we are [in performance], not ourselves any more, but the Maggiore, composed of so many disjunct parts: chairs, stands, music, bows, instruments, musicians ...\" \"The Rosendorf Quartet\", by Nathan Shaham, describes the trials of a string quartet in Palestine, before the establishment of the state of Israel. \"For the Love of It\" by Wayne Booth is a nonfictional account of the author's romance with cello playing and chamber music.\n\nNumerous societies are dedicated to the encouragement and performance of chamber music. Some of these are:\n\nIn addition to these national and international organizations, there are also numerous regional and local organizations that support chamber music. Some of the most prominent professional American chamber music ensembles and organizations are:\n\nThis is a partial list of the types of ensembles found in chamber music.

{"id": "30863286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30863286", "title": "Christian revival", "text": "Christian revival\n\nRevivalism is increased spiritual interest or renewal in the life of a church congregation or society, with a local, national or global effect. This should be distinguished from the use of the term \"revival\" to refer to an evangelistic meeting or series of meetings (see Revival meeting).\n\nRevivals are seen as the restoration of the church itself to a vital and fervent relationship with God after a period of moral decline. Mass conversions of non-believers are viewed by church leaders as having positive moral effects.\n\nWithin Christian studies the concept of revival is derived from biblical narratives of national decline and restoration during the history of the Israelites. In particular, narrative accounts of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah emphasise periods of national decline and revival associated with the rule of various righteous and wicked kings. Josiah is notable within this biblical narrative as a figure who reinstituted temple worship of Yahweh while destroying pagan worship. Within modern Church history, church historians have identified and debated the effects of various national revivals within the history of the USA and other countries. During the 18th and 19th centuries American society experienced a number of \"Awakenings\" around the years 1727, 1792, 1830, 1857 and 1882. More recent revivals in the 20th century include those of the 1904–1905 Welsh Revival, 1906 (Azusa Street Revival), 1930s (Balokole), 1970s (Jesus people), 1971 Bario Revival and 1909 Chile Revival which spread in the Americas, Africa, and Asia among Protestants and Catholics.\n\nThe Bible narrative records a number of revivals within the history of the Israelites. In particular, following the development of temple worship based in Jerusalem the Bible records periods of national decline and revival associated with the rule of righteous and wicked kings. Within this historical narrative the reign of Josiah epitomises the effect of revival on Israelite society in reinstituting temple worship of Yahweh and the rejection of pagan worship and idolatry. Other Jewish narratives such as the accounts of the Maccabean revolt in like manner record national revival characterised by the rejection of pagan worship practices and the military defeat and expulsion of idolatrous foreign powers.\n\nMany Christian revivals drew inspiration from the missionary work of early monks, from the Protestant Reformation (and Catholic Reformation) and from the uncompromising stance of the Covenanters in 17th-century Scotland and Ulster, that came to Virginia and Pennsylvania with Presbyterians and other non-conformists. Its character formed part of the mental framework that led to the American War of Independence and the Civil War.\n\nThe 18th century Age of Enlightenment had two camps: those who identified humans as only intellectual beings, Rationalists, and those who believed humans to be only passionate beings, followers of Romanticism. The philosophy of Earl of Shaftesbury III led to a Proto-Romanticism that mixed with Christian worship to produce a tertium quid. The Methodist revival of John Wesley, Charles Wesley and George Whitefield in England and Daniel Rowland, Howel Harris and William Williams, Pantycelyn in Wales and the Great Awakening in America prior to the Revolution. A similar (but smaller scale) revival in Scotland took place at Cambuslang, then a village and is known as the Cambuslang Work.\n\nIn the American colonies the First Great Awakening was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants that swept the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s, leaving a permanent impact on American religion. It resulted from powerful preaching that deeply affected listeners (already church members) with a deep sense of personal guilt and salvation by Christ. Pulling away from ancient ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made religion intensely emotive to the average person by creating a deep sense of spiritual guilt and redemption. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom sees it as part of a \"great international Protestant upheaval\" that also created Pietism in Germany, the Evangelical Revival and Methodism in England. It brought Christianity to the slaves and was an apocalyptic event in New England that challenged established authority. It incited rancor and division between the traditionalists who argued for ritual and doctrine and the revivalists who ignored or sometimes avidly contradicted doctrine, e.g. George Whitfield's being denied a pulpit in Anglican Churches after denying Anglican Doctrine. Its democratic features had a major impact in shaping the Congregational, Presbyterian, Dutch Reformed, and German Reformed denominations, and strengthened the small Baptist and Methodist denominations. It had little impact on Anglicans and Quakers. Unlike the Second Great Awakening that began about 1800 and which reached out to the unchurched, the First Great Awakening focused on people who were already church members. It changed their rituals, their piety, and their self-awareness.\n\nThe Hungarian Baptist church sprung out of revival with the perceived liberalism of the Hungarian reformed church during the late 1800s. Many thousands of people were baptized in a revival that was led primarily by uneducated laymen, the so-called \"peasant prophets\".\n\nDuring the 18th century, England saw a series of Methodist revivalist campaigns that stressed the tenets of faith set forth by John Wesley and that were conducted in accordance with a careful strategy. In addition to stressing the evangelist combination of \"Bible, cross, conversion, and activism,\" the revivalist movement of the 19th century made efforts toward a universal appeal – rich and poor, urban and rural, and men and women. Special efforts were made to attract children and to generate literature to spread the revivalist message.\n\nGobbett (1997) discusses the usefulness of historian Elie Halévy's thesis explaining why England did not undergo a social revolution in the period 1790–1832, a time that appeared ripe for violent social upheaval. Halévy suggested that a politically conservative Methodism forestalled revolution among the largely uneducated working class by redirecting its energies toward spiritual rather than temporal affairs. The thesis has engendered strong debate among historians, and several have adopted and modified Halévy's thesis. Some historians, such as Robert Wearmouth, suggest that evangelical revivalism directed working-class attention toward moral regeneration, not social radicalism. Others, including E. P. Thompson, claim that Methodism, though a small movement, had a politically regressive effect on efforts for reform. Some historians question the Halévy thesis. Eric Hobsbawm claims that Methodism was not a large enough movement to have been able to prevent revolution. Alan Gilbert suggests that Methodism's supposed antiradicalism has been misunderstood by historians, suggesting that it was seen as a socially deviant movement and the majority of Methodists were moderate radicals.\n\nEarly in the 19th century the Scottish minister Thomas Chalmers had an important influence on the evangelical revival movement. Chalmers began life as a moderate in the Church of Scotland and an opponent of evangelicalism. During the winter of 1803–04, he presented a series of lectures that outlined a reconciliation of the apparent incompatibility between the Genesis account of creation and the findings of the developing science of geology. However, by 1810 he had become an evangelical and would eventually lead the Disruption of 1843 that resulted in the formation of the Free Church of Scotland.\n\nThe Plymouth Brethren started with John Nelson Darby at this time, a result of disillusionment with denominationalism and clerical hierarchy.\n\nThe established churches too, were influenced by the evangelical revival. In 1833 a group of Anglican clergymen led by John Henry Newman and John Keble began the Oxford Movement. However its objective was to renew the Church of England by reviving certain Roman Catholic doctrines and rituals, thus distancing themselves as far as possible from evangelical enthusiasm.\n\nMany say that Australia has never been visited by a genuine religious revival as in other countries, but that is not entirely true. The effect of the Great Awakening of 1858-59 was also felt in Australia fostered mainly by the Methodist Church, one of the greatest forces for evangelism and missions the world has ever seen. Records show that the Methodist Church grew by a staggering 72% between 1857 and 1864, while the Baptists, Anglicans, Presbyterians and other evangelicals also benefited.\nEvangelical fervor was its height during the 1920s with visiting evangelists, R. A. Torrey, Wilbur J. Chapman, Charles M. Alexander and others winning many converts in their Crusades. The Crusades of American evangelist Billy Graham in the 1950s had significant impact on Australian Churches. Stuart Piggin (1988) explores the development and tenacity of the evangelical movement in Australia, and its impact on Australian society. Evangelicalism arrived from Britain as an already mature movement characterized by commonly shared attitudes toward doctrine, spiritual life, and sacred history. Any attempt to periodize the history of the movement in Australia should examine the role of revivalism and the oscillations between emphases on personal holiness and social concerns.\n\nHistorians have examined the revival movements in Scandinavia, with special attention to the growth of organizations, church history, missionary history, social class and religion, women in religious movements, religious geography, the lay movements as counter culture, ethnology, and social force. Some historians approach it as a cult process since the revivalist movements tend to rise and fall. Others study it as minority discontent with the status quo or, after the revivalists gain wide acceptance, as a majority that tends to impose its own standards. The Grundtvigian and Home Mission revival movements arose in Denmark after 1860 and reshaped religion in that country, and among immigrants to America.\n\nIn the U.S. the Second Great Awakening (1800–30s) was the second great religious revival in United States history and consisted of renewed personal salvation experienced in revival meetings. Major leaders included Asahel Nettleton, James Brainerd Taylor, Charles Grandison Finney, Lyman Beecher, Barton Stone, Alexander Campbell, Peter Cartwright and James B. Finley.\n\nRev. Charles Finney (1792–1875) was a key leader of the evangelical revival movement in America. From 1821 onwards he conducted revival meetings across many north-eastern states and won many converts. For him, a revival was not a miracle but a change of mindset that was ultimately a matter for the individual's free will. His revival meetings created anxiety in a penitent's mind that one could only save his or her soul by submission to the will of God, as illustrated by Finney's quotations from the Bible. Finney also conducted revival meetings in England, first in 1849 and later to England and Scotland in 1858–59.\n\nIn New England, the renewed interest in religion inspired a wave of social activism, including abolitionism. It had been here, in upstate New York's 'Burned-over district,' in the 1810s and 20s, that the religious fervor acquired a fevered pitch, and this intense revivalism spawned an authentically new American sect — which ultimately would become a major worldwide religion — Mormonism, founded by a young seeker of Christian primitivism, Joseph Smith, Jr (1805-1844).\n\nIn the West (now Upper South) especially—at Cane Ridge, Kentucky and in Tennessee—the revival strengthened the Methodists and Baptists. The Churches of Christ and Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) arose from the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement. It also introduced into America a new form of religious expression—the Scottish camp meeting.\n\nA movement in Swiss, eastern French, German, and Dutch Protestant history known as \"le Réveil\" (German: \"die Erweckung\", Dutch: \"Het Reveil\"). \"Le Réveil\" was a revival of Protestant Christianity along conservative evangelical lines at a time when rationalism had taken a strong hold in the churches on the continent of Europe.\n\nIn German-speaking Europe Lutheran Johann Georg Hamann (1730–88) was a leading light in the new wave of evangelicalism, the \"Erweckung\", which spread across the land, cross-fertilizing with British movements\n\nThe movement began in the Francophone world in connection with a circle of pastors and seminarians at French-speaking Protestant theological seminaries in Geneva, Switzerland and Montauban, France, influenced \"inter alia\" by the visit of Scottish Christian Robert Haldane in 1816–17. The circle included such figures as Merle D'Aubigne, César Malan, Felix Neff, and the Monod brothers.\n\nAs these men travelled out, the movement spread to Lyon and Paris in France, to Berlin and Eberfeld in Germany and to the Netherlands. Several missionary societies were founded to support this work, such as the British-based Continental society and the indigenous Geneva Evangelical Society.\n\nAs well as supporting existing Protestant denominations, in France and Germany the movement led to the creation of Free Evangelical Church groupings: the Union des Églises évangéliques libres and Bund Freier evangelischer Gemeinden in Deutschland.\n\nIn the Netherlands the movement was taken forward by Willem Bilderdijk, with Isaäc da Costa, Abraham Capadose, Samuel Iperusz Wiselius, Willem de Clercq and Groen van Prinsterer as his pupils. The movement was politically influential and actively involved in improving society, and — at the end of the 19th century — brought about anti-revolutionary and Christian historical parties.\n\nAt the same time in Britain figures such as William Wilberforce and Thomas Chalmers were active, although they are not considered to be part of the \"Le Reveil\" movement.\n\nIn North America the Third Great Awakening began from 1857 onwards in Canada and spread throughout the world including America and Australia. Significant names include Dwight L. Moody, Ira D. Sankey, William Booth and Catherine Booth (founders of the Salvation Army), Charles Spurgeon and James Caughey. Hudson Taylor began the China Inland Mission and Thomas John Barnardo founded his famous orphanages.\n\nRepresentative was Rev. James Caughey, an American sent by the Wesleyan Methodist Church to Canada from the 1840s through 1864. He brought in the converts by the score, most notably in the revivals in Canada West 1851-53. His technique combined restrained emotionalism with a clear call for personal commitment, coupled with follow-up action to organize support from converts. It was a time when the Holiness Movement caught fire, with the revitalized interest of men and women in Christian perfection. Caughey successfully bridged the gap between the style of earlier camp meetings and the needs of more sophisticated Methodist congregations in the emerging cities.\n\nIn England the Keswick Convention movement began out of the British Holiness movement, encouraging a lifestyle of holiness, unity and prayer.\n\nOn 21 September 1857 Jeremiah Lanphier, a businessman, began a series of prayer meetings in New York. By the beginning of 1858 the congregation was crowded, often with a majority of businessmen. Newspapers reported that over 6,000 were attending various prayer meetings in New York, and 6,000 in Pittsburgh. Daily prayer meetings were held in Washington, D.C. at 5 different times to accommodate the crowds. Other cities followed the pattern. Soon, a common mid-day sign on business premises read, \"We will re-open at the close of the prayer meeting\". By May, 50,000 of New York's 800,000 people were new converts.\n\nFinney wrote of this revival, \"This winter of 1857–58 will be remembered as the time when a great revival prevailed. It swept across the land with such power that at the time it was estimated that not less than 50,000 conversions occurred weekly.\" \n\nIn 1857, four young Irishmen began a weekly prayer meeting in the village of Connor near Ballymena. See also Ahoghill. This meeting is generally regarded as the origin of the 1859 Ulster Revival that swept through most of the towns and villages throughout Ulster and in due course brought 100,000 converts into the churches. It was also ignited by a young preacher, Henry Grattan Guinness, who drew thousands at a time to hear his preaching. So great was the interest in the American movement that in 1858 the Presbyterian General Assembly meeting in Derry appointed two of their ministers, Dr. William Gibson and Rev. William McClure to visit North America. Upon their return the two deputies had many public opportunities to bear testimony to what they had witnessed of the remarkable outpouring of the Spirit across the Atlantic, and to fan the flames in their homeland yet further. Such was the strength of emotion generated by the preachers' oratory that many made spontaneous confessions seeking to be relieved of their burdens of sin. Others suffered complete nervous breakdown.\n\nThe most recent Great Awakening (1904 onwards) had its roots in the holiness movement which had developed in the late 19th century. The Pentecostal revival movement began, out of a passion for more power and a greater outpouring of the Holy Spirit. In 1902 the American evangelists Reuben Archer Torrey and Charles McCallon Alexander conducted meetings in Melbourne, Australia, resulting in more than 8,000 converts. News of this revival travelled fast, igniting a passion for prayer and an expectation that God would work in similar ways elsewhere.\n\nTorrey and Alexander were involved in the beginnings of the great Welsh revival (1904).\n\nIn 1906 the modern Pentecostal movement was born in Azusa Street, in Los Angeles.\n\nThe \"rebaibal\", as it is known in Tok Pisin, had begun in the Solomon Islands and reached the Urapmin people by 1977. The Urapmin were particularly zealous in rejecting their traditional beliefs, and adopted a form of Charismatic Christianity based on Baptist Christianity. The Urapmin innovated the practices of spirit possession (known as the \"spirit disko\") and ritualized confessions, the latter being especially atypical for Protestantism.\n\nThe Welsh revival was not an isolated religious movement but very much a part of Britain's modernization. The revival began in the fall of 1904 under the leadership of Evan Roberts (1878–1951), a 26-year-old former collier and minister-in-training. The revival lasted less than a year, but in that period 100,000 converts were made. Begun as an effort to kindle nondenominational, nonsectarian spirituality, the Welsh revival of 1904–05 coincided with the rise of the labor movement, socialism, and a general disaffection with religion among the working class and youths. Placed in context, the short-lived revival appears as both a climax for Nonconformism and a flashpoint of change in Welsh religious life. The movement spread to Scotland and England, with estimates that a million people were converted in Britain. Missionaries subsequently carried the movement abroad; it was especially influential on the Pentecostal movement emerging in California.\n\nUnlike earlier religious revivals that pivoted on powerful preaching, the revival of 1904–05 relied primarily on music and on paranormal phenomena as exemplified by the visions of Evan Roberts. The intellectual emphasis of the earlier revivals had left a dearth of religious imagery that the visions supplied. They also challenged the denial of the spiritual and miraculous element of scripture by opponents of the revival, who held liberal and critical theological positions. The structure and content of the visions not only repeated those of Scripture and earlier Christian mystical tradition but also illuminated the personal and social tensions that the revival addressed by juxtaposing biblical images with scenes familiar to contemporary Welsh believers.\n\nexcerpt and text search\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2232929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232929", "title": "Chronotope", "text": "Chronotope\n\nIn literary theory and philosophy of language, the chronotope is how configurations of time and space are represented in language and discourse. The term was taken up by Russian literary scholar M.M. Bakhtin who used it as a central element in his theory of meaning in language and literature. The term itself comes from the Russian ', which in turn is derived from the Greek ' ('time') and \"\" ('space'); it thus can be literally translated as \"time-space.\" Bakhtin developed the term in his 1937 essay \"Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel\" (). Here Bakhtin showed how different literary genres operated with different configurations of time and space, which gave each genre its particular narrative character. For example, the chronotopic frame of the epic differed from that of the hero adventure or the comedy.\n\nIn the philosophy of language and philology, Bakhtin scholars Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist state that the chronotope is \"a unit of analysis for studying language according to the ratio and characteristics of the temporal and spatial categories represented in that language\". Specific chronotopes are said to correspond to particular genres, or relatively stable ways of speaking, which themselves represent particular worldviews or ideologies. To this extent, a chronotope is both a cognitive concept and a narrative feature of language.\n\nIn \"Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel,\" Bakhtin defines the chronotope thus:\n\nThe concept of the chronotope has been most widely used in literary studies. The scholar Timo Müller for example argued that analysis of chronotopes highlights the environmental dimension of literary texts because it draws attention to the concrete physical spaces in which stories take place. Müller discusses the chronotope of the road, which for Bakhtin was a meeting place but in recent literature no longer brings people together in this way because automobiles have changed the way we perceive the time and space of the road. Car drivers want to minimize the time they spend on the road. They are rarely interested in the road as a physical space, the natural environment around the road, or the environmental implications of their driving. This contrasts with earlier literary examples such as Robert Frost's poem \"The Road Not Taken\" or John Steinbeck's novel \"The Grapes of Wrath\", where the road is described as part of the natural environment and the travelers are interested in that environment.\n\nLinguistic anthropologist Keith Basso invoked \"chronotopes\" in discussing Western [Apache] stories linked with places. In the 1980s when Basso was writing, geographic features reminded the Western Apache of \"the moral teachings of their history\" by recalling to mind events that occurred there in important moral narratives. By merely mentioning \"it happened at [the place called] 'men stand above here and there,'\" storyteller Nick Thompson could remind locals of the dangers of joining \"with outsiders against members of their own community.\" Geographic features in the Western Apache landscape are chronotopes, Basso says, in precisely the way Bakhtin defines the term when he says they are \"points in the geography of a community where time and space intersect and fuse. Time takes on flesh and becomes visible for human contemplation; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time and history and the enduring character of a people. ...Chronotopes thus stand as monuments to the community itself, as symbols of it, as forces operating to shape its members' images of themselves\" (qtd. in Basso 1984: 44–45).\n\nAnthropologist of syncretism Safet HadžiMuhamedović built upon Bakhtin’s term in his ethnography of the Field of Gacko in the southeastern Bosnian highlands. In \"Waiting for\" \"Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape\", he argued that people and landscapes may sometimes be trapped between timespaces and thus \"schizochronotopic\" (from the Greek σχίζειν (\"skhizein\"): \"to split\"). He described two overarching chronotopes as \"collective timespace themes\", both of which relied on certain kinds of past and laid claims to the Field’s future. One was told through proximities, the other through distances between religious communities. For HadžiMuhamedović, schizochronotopia is a rift occurring within the same body/landscape, through which the past and the present of place have rendered each other unbidden. \n\nThe chronotope has also been adopted for the analysis of classroom events and conversations, for example by Raymond Brown and Peter Renshaw in order to view \"student participation in the classroom as a dynamic process constituted through the interaction of past experience, ongoing involvement, and yet-to-be-accomplished goals\" (2006: 247–259). Kumpulainen, Mikkola, and Jaatinen (2013) examined the space–time configurations of students’ technology-mediated creative learning practices over a year-long school musical project in a Finnish elementary school. The findings of their study suggest that \"blended practices appeared to break away from traditional learning practices, allowing students to navigate in different time zones, spaces, and places with diverse tools situated in their formal and informal lives\" (2013: 53).\n\n"}
{"id": "207666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207666", "title": "Command &amp; Conquer", "text": "Command &amp; Conquer\n\nCommand & Conquer (C&C) is a real-time strategy (RTS) video game franchise, first developed by Westwood Studios. The first game was one of the earliest of the RTS genre, itself based on Westwood Studios' influential strategy game \"Dune II\" and introducing trademarks followed in the rest of the series. This includes full-motion video cutscenes with a notable ensemble cast to progress the story, as opposed to digitally in-game rendered cutscenes. Westwood Studios was taken over by Electronic Arts in 1998 and closed down in 2003. The studio and some of its members were absorbed into EA Los Angeles, which continued development on the series.\n\nAfter Westwood Studios developed the critically acclaimed \"Dune II\", \"Computer Gaming World\" reported in 1993 that the company would not use the \"Dune\" license for Westwood's next strategy game \"mostly because the programmers are tired of sand\". The magazine stated that it would have \"new terrain and enemies\", and that \"the design team is serious about doing a multi-player version\".\n\n\"Command & Conquer\" was released worldwide by Westwood in 1995. The plot is set sometime in the near future where the Earth becomes contaminated by a mysterious resource known as Tiberium. A global war ensues between the UN-formed Global Defense Initiative to contain it and the cult quasi-state revolutionary Brotherhood of Nod, led by the enigmatic Kane, which seeks to harness it. Highly successful, it was followed by \"\" in 1996 which is set in an alternate universe where the Soviet Union wages war with the Allies. Developed as the prequel to the original, the \"Red Alert\" series was spun off into a separate, lighthearted and comic series, while the original game and its sequels became known as the \"Tiberium\" series, retaining its science fiction and serious tone. The first game is sometimes referred to as \"Tiberian Dawn\" as a result.\n\nThe original game was followed by \"\" in 1999 and its expansion pack \"\". In 2002, a first person-shooter set in the \"Tiberium\" universe, \"\", was released and praised for its online features. \"\" was released in 2007 and followed by the expansion pack \"\". \"\", released in 2010 as the conclusion to the \"Tiberium\" saga, received noticeably more mixed reviews because of its deviation from traditional gameplay and story. The \"Red Alert\" series was continued by the 2000 title \"\", its expansion, \"Yuri's Revenge\" and \"\" in 2008, which introduced a third \"Empire of the Rising Sun\" faction. A spin-off game in 2003, \"\", set in a more realistic near-future and featuring the United States, China and the Global Liberation Army was followed by an expansion pack, \"\".\n\nThe series was originally marketed to an Anglophone audience, though many of the games have been translated into other languages including German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Korean, and Chinese. The series is primarily developed for personal computers running Microsoft Windows, although some titles have been ported to various video game consoles and the Apple Macintosh. Other games for platforms such as iOS and web-based have also been developed. As of July 2010, the \"Command & Conquer\" franchise consists of eleven games and eight expansion packs. The first three games of the series have been released as freeware to promote the successors. A free-to-play game, entitled \"Command & Conquer\", was in development with the studio Victory Games. It was set to be the next game in the series and was expected to be released in 2013. However, after a short alpha period the game was cancelled, and Victory Games disbanded by EA. The \"Command & Conquer\" series has been a commercial success with over 30 million \"Command & Conquer\" games sold as of 2009.\n\nThe \"Command & Conquer\" are real-time strategy games, with the exception of the first-person shooter \"\". A staple of the series is the parallel campaigns of various different factions to one central storyline. Games in the series also offered multiplayer game options, via LAN and modem connection. All games in the series have also offered online play, as well as \"skirmish\" matches in which players can face AI enemies.\n\nAll \"Command & Conquer\" real-time strategy games except \"Command & Conquer: Generals\" and its expansions have featured the \"side bar\" for navigation and control as opposed to many other similar games where the control bar is located on the bottom of the screen.\n\n\"Command & Conquer\" gameplay typically requires the player to construct a base and acquire resources, in order to fund the ongoing production of various types of forces with which to assault and conquer the opponent's base. All available structures of the faction chosen by the player are constructed on-site at so-called \"construction yard\" - which typically begin as large-sized vehicles capable of deploying themselves into the aforementioned construction yards, called MCVs or Mobile Construction Vehicle. When a construction yard has finished building a new structure, the player can select a spot near to a preexisting structure in order to place it, where the prefabricated building will then rapidly unfold in a distinctive manner.\n\nIn all games in the series except \"Command & Conquer: Generals\" and its expansion, \"Zero Hour\", funds are acquired by specialized \"harvester\" units which bring their cargo (Tiberium for the \"Tiberian\" series of games or ore or the more valuable gems for the \"Red Alert\" series) to a \"refinery\" structure. This in turn will convert the raw material into usable resources, expressed as credits. The raw materials themselves, in games released before \"Red Alert 2\" as well as \"Command & Conquer 3\" require storage space in the form of refineries and, in the case of excess, \"storage silo\" structures. In \"Generals\" and \"Zero Hour\", funds are collected by two methods: collection of supplies by specialized units and converted to money in \"supply centers\" or directly produced by specialized units, buildings, or tech buildings at a set interval of time.\n\nAll factions have structures and units with similar functions at their disposal. However, they are adjusted to fit each faction's theme and have somewhat varying properties. Units can be classified into infantry, vehicles, and aircraft, each with their own subdivisions (note: in the \"Red Alert\" series there is also naval craft available). Unit effectiveness against opponents follows the rock-paper-scissors (intransitivity) principle found in most real-time strategy games.\n\nVirtually every type of structure in the series acts as a tech tree node, and additional units, structures and faction-specific abilities will become available as new structures are built and placed. Access to advanced units and abilities may be temporarily blocked if the required structures are destroyed or if they are not being provided with adequate power by the supporting \"power plant\" structures.\n\nEach \"Command & Conquer\" game has included the ability to play multiplayer games against other players. Each box of \"Command & Conquer\" contains two CD copies of the game, immediately making multiplayer gaming possible with a single purchase of the game. Westwood Studios advertised this on the packaging with the slogan \"A second copy, so you and your friend can destroy each other.\" This resulted in \"Command & Conquer\" becoming the first RTS game title to feature competitive online play, and this is considered the most pertinent outside factor in the success of \"Command & Conquer\". All games in the series up to \"Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2\" also featured two CDs that could be used for this reason. However, later games did not.\n\n\"Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3\" was noted for being the first RTS game to enable the campaigns to be played cooperatively online; others had only supported single player campaigns. However, it was only possible to connect to other computers through EA's servers and not with LAN play.\n\nGames produced by Westwood use the proprietary Westwood Online system to facilitate multiplayer games over the Internet; \"Renegade\" also supported GameSpy. Games under EA's development continued to use GameSpy, but dropped support for Westwood Online in favor of using EA's own servers. The GameSpy master servers have shut down in 2013. The community filled the gap with their services.\n\nSince the shutdown of EA's servers and removed support for the games, the fan base for the series has created their own way to play online. The well maintained CNC online website allows for players to still face off many years after the official server shutdowns. CNC online only supports Command And conquer games made by EA Los Angeles (2003 and later)\n\n\"Command & Conquer\", released on September 26, 1995, is the first game in the series and is considered as the title which originally defined and popularized the real-time strategy genre. \"Command & Conquer\" introduced the warring factions of the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod. \"Command & Conquer\" was well received and was widely praised by critics: \"\"Command & Conquer\" is one of the finest, most brilliantly-designed computer games I have ever seen\" said GameSpot reviewer Chris Hudak. \"Command & Conquer\" has attained 94% as an aggregate score from Metacritic with the less well received \"Covert Operations\" expansion pack obtaining an aggregate score of 72% after its 1996 release.\n\n\"\", released on August 27, 1999, takes place approximately 30 years after the events in its predecessor. While the original \"Command & Conquer\"s plot was centered around an allegorical world politics setting, \"Tiberian Sun\" shifted this to a more science fiction-like setting against the apocalyptic background of Tiberium beginning to assimilate vast portions of the Earth's ecosystems. In 1998, Westwood Studios, the developers of \"Tiberian Sun\", was acquired by Electronic Arts. However, EA had no direct part in the development of the title. Compared to its predecessor, \"Tiberian Sun\" relies heavily on science fiction technologies and introduces a new isometric game engine featuring varying level terrain to give the impression of a true 3D environment.\n\nThe full motion video is also scripted differently; while the cutscenes of \"Command & Conquer\" and \"Red Alert\" were filmed from a first-person perspective, \"Tiberian Sun\" used traditional cinematic shots for its FMVs featuring actors such as James Earl Jones and Michael Biehn.\n\n\"\", released February 26, 2002, takes place in the final days of the events of \"Command & Conquer\" and was the last \"Command & Conquer\" game to be created by \"Westwood Studios\" before their liquidation in 2003. Unlike any other games in the series, \"Renegade\" is a first-person shooter. Although receiving average reviews, with an aggregate score of 75% on both GameRankings and Metacritic, \"Renegade\" was praised for its online features. GameSpy awarded \"Renegade\" its 2002 \"Wish it had been better\" award, condemning the single player but saying that \"C&C: Renegade's multiplayer was innovative and fun\". Online play was praised for encouraging teamwork and coordinated assaults, unlike other contemporary first-person shooters.\n\n\"\", released March 29, 2007, was a return to the real-time strategy roots of the \"Command & Conquer\" series. As a direct sequel to \"Tiberian Sun\", \"Tiberium Wars\" is set approximately 17 years after the events of \"Tiberian Sun\" and features the introduction of a third faction, the Scrin. The sequel attained an aggregate score of 85% from both GameRankings and Metacritic. \"PC Gamer\" U.S. gave the game its \"Editor's Choice\" rating at 90%, stating that \"one of the greatest RTS franchises of all time returns to glory\", while PC Gamer UK gave it a more reserved rating of 82%, stating that it was \"a welcome, but limited, return\".\n\nShortly after the release of \"Tiberium Wars\", the expansion pack \"\" was announced. Released on March 24, 2008, \"Kane's Wrath\" limited the player to only the Brotherhood of Nod in the campaign mode, though the original factions and six new sub-factions are available for the new strategic mode and skirmish mode. Reception was mainly positive with the expansion attaining an aggregate score of 77%.\n\n\"\", released on March 16, 2010, saw a big change in gameplay from the previous \"Command & Conquer\" by removing the resource gathering and base building elements in previous games as well as the removal of the third faction, the Scrin. It is a direct sequel to \"Kane's Wrath\" (however not directly following on from its storyline), and is set 10 years after the game's final events, a time when Tiberium has advanced to its next evolutionary stage, and is rapidly spreading across Earth making it soon to be uninhabitable.\n\n\"Renegade X\", is a free, fan-made remake of \"\". The developers received approval from EA to release their game, and it entered open beta on February 26, 2014. \"Renegade X\" includes a short single-player campaign called Black Dawn.\n\n\"\", released on November 22, 1996, is set in an alternate universe 1950s and was originally made to be the prequel to \"Command & Conquer\" establishing \"Red Alert\" as the prologue of the entire \"Tiberium\" series of games. Louis Castle has said that connecting \"Red Alert\" with the \"Tiberium\" series was a \"failed experiment\". \"Red Alert\" introduces the Allies and the Soviets as rival factions roughly analogous to NATO and the Warsaw Pact of the Cold War. The game was received well by critics and has the highest average score of any \"Command & Conquer\" game with an average of over 90% from GameRankings and Metacritic, unlike the title's two expansion packs, \"Red Alert: Counterstrike\" and \"Red Alert: The Aftermath\" of which both received below average reviews for the series with 63% and 70% average scores respectively. Both expansions gave the game more missions and more units. For PlayStation only, there was also a separate release to the original called \"Red Alert: Retaliation\" which included all the maps, missions and units of \"Red Alert: Counterstrike\" and \"Red Alert: The Aftermath\" as well as some newly filmed cut-scenes only available with \"Red Alert: Retaliation\". Before being re-released as freeware on 31 August 2008 by Electronic Arts \"Command & Conquer: Red Alert\" had sold over three million copies.\n\n\"\" was released on October 23, 2000. It featured a Soviet invasion of North America with tanks, conscripts, large airships, and psychically dominated anti-ship giant squid. Since that game lacked reference to the \"Tiberian\" series, the connection established in the first \"Red Alert\" game became unclear. However, it has been implied by the original creators of the series, now working at Petroglyph Games, that \"Red Alert 2\" takes place in a parallel universe that came about as a result of time travel experiments taking place some time into the \"Tiberian\" series. \"Red Alert 2\" was received fairly positively with an aggregate score of 86% from GameRankings.\n\nAn expansion pack to \"Red Alert 2\", \"\" was released on October 10, 2001. In \"Yuri's Revenge\", an ex-Soviet figure named Yuri, tries to conquer the world using psychic technology and his own private army. The expansion pack received mostly positive reviews. GameRankings reports an average score of 85% based on 31 reviews, making \"Yuri's Revenge\" the best received expansion pack in the \"Command & Conquer\" series.\n\n\"\", released on October 28, 2008, followed up on the story of \"Red Alert 2\" and continued the series' more \"light-hearted\" take on \"Command & Conquer\". It introduced many new comical units and the Empire of the Rising Sun faction, an anime inspired version of the Empire of Japan. Executive producer Chris Corry stated in a pre-release interview that \"Red Alert 3\" will further differentiate the playable factions from each other and \"[play] up the silliness in their faction design whenever possible\". This approach was seen as popular with \"Red Alert 3\" obtaining an aggregate score of 82% from Metacritic. A stand-alone expansion to \"Red Alert 3\", \"\" was released on March 12, 2009 to fairly poor reviews for the series with an average score of 64% from Metacritic. Another downloadable standalone game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was released known as \"\" which contained the Commander's Challenge mode of Uprising for consoles.\n\n\"\" was released on October 16, 2009 for iOS which was a continuation of the story of \"Red Alert 2\" and takes place before \"Red Alert 3\". It contained two factions, the Allies and Soviet Union with a third faction, the Empire of the Rising Sun, to be added in its expansion pack. However this is version of the game is not available in some regions (e.g. Uk).\n\nOn April 23, 2018, the Chinese developer Tencent announced a new iOS version of Red Alert would be made available, with a highly mixed reception from fans online.\n\n\"\", released on February 10, 2003, has a plotline which is unrelated to the other games of the \"Command & Conquer\" series. \"Generals\" is set in the near future and features the United States, China and the fictional terrorist organization, the Global Liberation Army. \"Generals\" uses an engine dubbed SAGE (or Strategy Action Game Engine) and is the first fully three-dimensional \"Command & Conquer\" real-time strategy game. After its release, \"Generals\" received mostly positive reviews. Based on 34 reviews, Metacritic gives it a score of 84/100 which includes a score of 9.3/10 from IGN. \"Generals\" has also received the E3 2002 Game Critics Awards Best Strategy Game award. One review noted that Generals was the first \"Command & Conquer\" real-time strategy game that did not include full-motion video cutscenes to tell the story and that it departed from the unique interface and base-building mechanics that had characterized all of the previous \"C&C\" RTS titles.\n\nAn expansion for \"Generals\", \"\", was released on September 22, 2003 to further the \"Generals\" storyline. \"Zero Hour\" added 9 new armies to the game, over a dozen new campaign missions, and a gameplay mode known as Generals Challenge. Unlike \"Generals\", \"Zero Hour\" featured the return of full motion videos to the series. \"Zero Hour\" obtained much the same reception as \"Generals\" with an aggregate score of 85% and 84% from GameRankings and Metacritic respectively.\n\nAfter EA Los Angeles started up their new internal group Danger Close and switched its focus to the \"Medal of Honor\" series, EA launched a new studio named Victory Games to continue the \"Command & Conquer\" franchise. On December 10, 2011, Electronic Arts posted that the next game in the series would be \"\". On December 14, it was also announced that a new browser-based, free-to-play MMO \"Command & Conquer\" game is under development, under the name \"\". On December 15, \"Tiberium Alliances\" began a closed beta.\n\nOn August 15, 2012, it was announced that \"Generals 2\" would be repurposed to a free-to-play game known as simply \"Command & Conquer\". The new game would have been based around the \"Generals\" franchise. However, following feedback from players who were able to play the alpha trial, the game was cancelled in October 2013. In 2013, EA has said that the franchise will continue, but has given no other information. In 2014, EA was looking for a new developer for the reboot.\n\nOn June 9, 2018, EA revealed \"\", which is under development by the newly-formed EA Redwood Studios for Android and iOS mobile devices.\n\nEA announced in November 2018 its plans to remaster \"Command & Conquer\", including expansions and \"Red Alert\", for modern computer systems through Petroglyph Games. There is no current estimated release date.\n\n\n\nSee also canceled Command & Conquer games.\n\n\nMuch of the music for the series was composed and produced by Westwood Studios' former sound director and video game music composer Frank Klepacki for the early games, with composition duties being taken on by several others following the liquidation of Westwood Studios in 2003. Klepacki returned to the series in 2008 however to assist with the soundtrack for \"\".\n\nThe music has been received positively by critics, although praise was higher with earlier entries.\n\nThe original score for \"Command & Conquer: Red Alert\" was composed by Frank Klepacki and was voted the best video game soundtrack of 1996 by PC Gamer and Gameslice magazines. Among his most famous songs from the series is the theme of \"Red Alert\", titled \"Hell March\", which accents the style of the game with adrenalized riffs of electric guitar, the sounds of marching feet, and synthesizers to a dramatic chant. Originally intended to be the theme for the Brotherhood of Nod faction in the \"Covert Operations\" expansion to the original 1995 \"Command & Conquer\" game, the track eventually ended up enlisting itself as a staple in the \"Red Alert\" series instead, and a second version of \"Hell March\" was specifically created for \"\".\n\nThe \"Command & Conquer\" series have been a commercial success with over 30 million \"Command & Conquer\" games sold as of 2009. Games in the series have nearly consistently scored highly on video game review aggregator websites GameRankings and Metacritic, which collect data from numerous review websites. As noted in the table below, the highest rated game is \"Command & Conquer\" with a score of 94% from Metacritic. The highest rated game averaged over both sites is \"Command & Conquer: Red Alert\" with an average of just over 90%. As a series, \"Command & Conquer\" games have averaged approximately 80% when including expansion packs and approximately 84% without.\n\n\"Command & Conquer\"s long history resulted in Guinness World Records awarding the series six world records in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008. These records include \"Biggest Selling RTS Series\", \"Most Number of Platforms for an RTS\", and \"Longest Running Actor in Video Game Role\" for Joe Kucan, who has played the part of Kane, the villainous mastermind of the series, for 15 years.\n\n\n"}

A belief (that p, say) depicts the world as being in a state of affairs such that p is true. Beliefs, some philosophers have argued, aim at the truth and so aim to fit the world. A belief is satisfied when it fits the world.\n\nA desire, on the other hand, normally expresses a yet to be realized state of affairs and so has a world-to-mind direction of fit. A desire that p, unlike a belief, doesn't depict the world as being in the state that p; rather it expresses a desire that the world be such that p is true. Desire is a state that is satisfied when the world fits it.\n\nA way to account for the difference is that a (rational) person that holds the belief that p when confronted with evidence that not-p, will revise his belief, whereas a person that desires that p can retain his desire that p in the face of evidence that not-p.\n\nTo a philosopher of language a word-to-world fit occurs when, say, a sports journalist correctly names Jones as a goal scorer; while if the journalist mistakenly names Smith as the goal scorer, the printed account does \"not\" display a word-to-world fit, and must be altered such that it matches the real world. Conversely, a world-to-word fit occurs when a fan of Smith's team opines that they deserved to win the match, even though they lost. In this case, the world would have to change to make the sports fan's wish become true.\n\nHowever, in the case of, say, a judge delivering a death sentence to a criminal declared guilty by a jury, the utterances of the judge \"alter\" the world, through the fact of that utterance; and, in this case, the judge is generating a world-to-word-to-world fit (see below). So, if the judge's opinion is upheld, the world \"must\" be altered to match the content of the judge's utterance (i.e., the criminal must be executed).\n\nAccording to Thomas Aquinas (\"Summa Theologica\", Part I, Question 21, Article 2), there are two kinds of \"truth\" (\"veritas\"), both understood as correspondence between mind (\"intellectus\") or words (\"oratio\") and world (\"things\", \"res\"):\nPerhaps the first to speak of a \"direction of fit\" was the philosopher J. L. Austin. Austin did not use the distinction between different directions of fit to contrast commands or expressions of intention to assertions, or desires to beliefs. He rather distinguishes different ways of asserting that an item is of a certain type.\n\nIn an extensive discussion of the issues involved with the differences between, say, (a) wrongly calling a triangle a square (something which, he said, was committing an act of violence to the language) and (b) wrongly describing a triangular object as being a square (something which, he said, was committing an act of violence to the facts), Austin distinguished between what he termed:\n\nThe concept of direction of fit can also apply to speech acts: e.g., statements, guesses and conjectures have word-to-world direction of fit, while commands and promises have a world-to-word direction of fit.\n\nJohn Searle and Daniel Vanderveken assert that there are only four possible \"directions of fit\" in language:\n\nSearle used this notion of \"direction of fit\" to create a taxonomy of illocutionary acts.\nAlthough Elizabeth Anscombe never employed the term \"the direction of fit\", Searle has strongly argued that the following passage from her work Intention was, by far, \"the best illustration\" of the distinction between the tasks of \"[getting] the words (more strictly their propositional content) to match the world… [and that of getting] the world to match the words\":\n\nAccording to Velleman, when used in the domain of the philosophy of mind, the concept direction of fit represents the distinguishing feature between two types of intentional mental states:\n\nIn some forms of mind-body dualism, a matching \"factum\" and \"faciendum\" must be present in a person's mind in order for him to act intentionally. If a person has the belief that action (A) will lead to state (S), and has the desire that state (S) obtain, then he will perform action (A). The action is directly caused by simultaneous presence of the two mental states; no further explanation is needed.\n\nAccording to Velleman:\n\n"}

In general, groups who seek to influence government policy on domestic or foreign issues are referred to as advocacy groups. Those interest groups established by ethnic identity groups are referred as to \"ethnic interest groups\".\n\nAccording to Thomas Ambrosio, most ethnic identity groups have connections inside their host country. These connections can be derived from membership in a diaspora, with ethnic kin in their historical homeland (e.g. Anglo-Saxon Americans and Britain, Italian-Americans and Italy, Armenian-Americans and Armenia, Arab-Americans and the Middle East) or scattered among many countries (e.g. Jewish-Americans, Palestinian-Americans), or based on perceived similarities with others even though they may share little or no common ancestry (e.g. White Southerners and Afrikaners in South Africa, African-Americans and black South Africans, Muslims worldwide.) Because of the concern of the ethnic groups for \"kin\" in foreign states, many ethnic interest groups focus on influencing the foreign policy of their host countries to benefit there foreign \"kin\" and thus act as foreign policy interest groups.\n\nThe influence of ethnic groups on the foreign policy of many states, including that of the United States, is \"a reality\", although these ethnic groups must \"compete for influence with a plethora of other special interest groups and institutional interests.\" According to a literature review of the topic conducted by Patrick J. Haney and Walt Vanderbush, the primary factors that determine the relative strength of influence of an ethnic interest group are:\n\nDiscussing the influence and proper role of ethnic groups in the formulation of foreign policy has often been difficult and contentious. This section first describes the typical characteristics of the debates which restrict their focus to the legitimacy of or the harm caused by ethnic lobbies. The second section presents a response to simplistic debates of ethnic lobbies devoid of context, by refocusing on the identification of the interests of the broader community and then permitting or limiting the influence of ethnic lobbies based on their alignment within the interests of the broader context.\n\nDiscussions of foreign policy formulation and the involvement of ethnic interest groups often become debates on the legitimacy or illegitimacy of ethnic interest groups devoid of wider context. The two opposing positions often expressed in these debates: One interpretations welcomes a \"multicultural foreign policy\" and thus views the influence of ethnic groups as legitimate. The opposing interpretation comes to a conclusion that the influence of ethnic interest groups can result in a \"parochial capture\" of a nation's foreign policy that harms the \"true\" national interest and common good.\n\nThose arguing for a \"multicultural foreign policy\" \"see little wrong with ethnic groups having a voice in the foreign policy process.\" They tend to \"believe that a more diverse foreign policy\" results in the enrichment of the nation \"both at home and abroad.\"\n\nThere are six common arguments in favor of the \"enriching multiculturalism\" interpretation:\n\nThose who argue against the idea of a multicultural foreign policy influenced by domestic ethnic interest groups often begin from a \"realist\" perspective and \"start with the premise that there exists 'objective' [national] interests that may (or may not) differ from the interests of substate political actors (ethnic, business or otherwise). Thus, a tension potentially exists between 'national' and 'special' interests. According to this argument, ethnic identity groups may harm the [nation] if these groups distract the [nation] from the pursuit of its national interests or induce it to pursue a foreign policy contrary to its national interests. In the worst-case scenario, ethnic groups can effectively hijack the foreign policy process and use the strength of [the nation] for their \"parochial interests\".\"\n\nThere are seven common arguments in favor of the \"parochial capture\" interpretation:\n\nBoth stances, according to Ambrosio, are unrealistic.\n\nThe uncritical embrace of ethnic interests in the formulation of foreign policy, as favored by the \"enriching multiculturalism\" interpretation, is problematic because:\n\nEqually unworkable is the complete exclusion of ethnic participation in foreign policy formulation advocated by the \"parochial capture\" interpretation:\n\nA productive alternative, according to Ambrosio, to debating the abstract legitimacy or harm of ethnic influence in the general case, is reorienting the debate towards identifying, clarifying and methods of pursuing the nation's broad interests. Only after the broader community' interests and thus goals are identified, can one properly evaluate the value, in the rich context of the nation's broadly established common good, offered by the involvement or influence of individual special or ethnic interest groups. The result is that ethnic interest groups with goals that align with the broader community will be bestowed with more legitimacy than those goals exhibit less or no alignment.\n\nAmbrosio writes:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "59374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59374", "title": "Ethnic origin", "text": "Ethnic origin\n\nThe concept of ethnic origin is an attempt to classify people, not according to their current nationality, but according to commonalities in their social background. For example, somebody living in a monocultural environment, speaking English and clearly a member of an English-speaking cultural milieu, may be descended from immigrants speaking some other language and still participate in some other aspects of their culture.\n\nEthnic origin implies one or more of the following: \n\nEthnic origin has become a popular classification in statistics, where the concept of races has been largely discarded since World War II, for various reasons. A reaction against the abuses of the Nazis and apartheid made it hard to collect, store or publish racial data. Social scientists in general have lost interest in race as useful concept of study, with many other differences between population groups more significant. However the relative prosperity of distinguishable groups remain of interest in public policy discussions.\n\nIn the US, however, the use of the term race is still current. The census asks questions about race, though the classification used is no different from what would be termed ethnic origin elsewhere.\n\nThe concept of ethnic origin in practice may seem arbitrary and without a rigorous definition of how to assign a person to the particular categories. If a person was asked for their ethnic origin and answered \"how do I tell what ethnic origin I am?\" it may not be clear whether they are being asked for: their country of birth, the country of birth of their parents, or more distant ancestors (how distant?), or for a description of their appearance, such as skin colour or hair type, or for their cultural behaviour such as food, clothing, language and the people they associate with. The answers to these questions may be contradictory and suggest different ethnic origins.\n\nThe answer of interest to the questioner is probably whether the person considers themselves to be a member of a particular ethnic subdivision of society, or are considered a member of such a group by others. This would affect whether they were possibly subject to discrimination etc. However the question is still open to interpretation, since a person may be identified differently depending on the mode of contact, e.g., considering outward appearance such as skin colour or clothing, name, or use of written or oral language, etc. This raises the question of whether ethnic origin is just another term for ethnic group.\n"}

It is intended as a framework that will allow organisations who work on behalf of the country's children and their families to provide a consistent, supportive approach for all. It is best known for the controversial \"Named Person\" requirement.\n\nIt requires that services aimed at children and young people – social work, health, education, police, housing and voluntary organisations – adapt and streamline their systems and practices and work together. The approach encourages earlier intervention by professionals to avoid crisis situations at a later date.\n\nThe GIRFEC approach arose out of the review of the Children's Hearings System in 2004. The review recognised that in order to improve outcomes for vulnerable children, agencies need to intervene earlier, in a better and more integrated way in response to identified needs and risks, and not when a threshold is reached to trigger action. The origins of the approach can be traced back to the Kilbrandon Report (1964), reinforced by publications such as 'For Scotland's Children'.\n\nDevelopment and early implementation of this approach took place across Scotland. In Highland there were pathfinder projects that launched in September 2006 followed by an implementation phase that began in January 2008. The Lanarkshire pathfinder reported that GIRFEC had led to a sharper focus on the needs of the child and had also helped a culture of shared responsibility among education, health and social work.\n\nImplementation of GIRFEC has included some change management elements, with a programme designed to achieve some consistency around meeting the needs of – and improving outcomes for – all children and young people in Scotland.\n\nThe Scottish Government has published a number of guides and resources. to support implementation.\n\nIn October 2012 a programme of visits was carried out by HM Inspectors to review the readiness of the education system in using GIRFEC approaches to help ensure that children and families get the right help at the right time.\n\nIn July 2012 details of a bill were announced that included embedding the GIRFEC approach in a single system of planning and delivery across children's services A 12-week period of consultation followed and many organisations and individuals submitted responses. The Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014 became law on the 27 March 2014 enshrining in law key elements of the Getting it Right approach.\n\nUnder GIRFEC each child in Scotland will be assigned a \"Named Person\". The Named Person is intended to be a clear point of contact if a child, young person or their parents want information or advice, or if they want to talk about any worries and seek support. The Named Personwill usually be the health visitor for a pre-school child and a promoted teacher - such as a headteacher, or guidance teacher or other promoted member of staff - for a school age child.\n\nCriticism of the Named Person requirement (referred to as a \"state guardian\" in some media) has been aired in some press, newspaper columns, and by home educators, churches, various opposition MSPs and lawyers. Concerns expressed by home educators included: the \"Named Person\" requirement not being an opt-in service; \"welfare\" may be subject to the bias of the Named Person; and personal data is gathered and shared.\n\nIn July 2014 a campaign group lodged legal papers at the Court of Session, challenging the Named Person plans. In January 2015 this legal challenge was dismissed, with the judge explaining that the case \"fails on all points\". An appeal against this dismissal was heard by Lord Carloway in the Court of Session in June 2015. Lord Carloway also dismissed the concerns raised by the campaign group saying \"It [the creation of a Named Person] has no effect whatsoever on the legal, moral or social relationships within the family. The assertion to the contrary, without any supporting basis, has the appearance of hyperbole.\"\n\nOn 28 July, 2016, the UK Supreme Court ruled against some aspects of the scheme. Judges said that some proposals breach rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. While they said that the aim of the Act is \"unquestionably legitimate and benign\" they also said that specific proposals about information-sharing \"are not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament\" and that the legislation made it \"perfectly possible\" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a \"wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware\".\n\nThe Scottish government says it will not commence the legislation until the criticisms are addressed, delaying the implementation until after the end of 2016.\n\n\n"}

The adjective form \"hallowed\", as used in \"The Lord's Prayer\", means holy, consecrated, sacred, or revered. The noun form \"hallow\", as used in \"Hallowtide\", is a synonym of the word saint.\n\nThe noun is from the Old English adjective \"hālig\", nominalised as \"se hālga\" \"the holy man\". The Gothic word for \"holy\" is either \"hailags\" or \"weihaba\", \"weihs\". \"To hold as holy\" or \"to become holy\" is \"weihnan\", \"to make holy, to sanctify\" is \"weihan\". Holiness or sanctification is \"weihiþa\". Old English, like Gothic, had a second term of similar meaning, \"wēoh\" \"holy\", with a substantive \"wīh\" or \"wīg\", Old High German \"wīh\" or \"wīhi\" (Middle High German \"wîhe\", Modern German \"Weihe\"). The Nordendorf fibula has \"wigiþonar\", interpreted as \"wīgi-þonar\" \"holy Donar\" or \"sacred to Donar\". Old Norse \"vé\" is a type of shrine. The \"weihs\" group is cognate to Latin \"victima\", an animal dedicated to the gods and destined to be sacrificed.\n\nHallow, as a noun, is a synonym of the word saint. In modern English usage, the noun \"hallow\" appears mostly in the compound Hallowtide, a liturgical season which includes the days of Halloween and Hallowmas. Halloween (or \"Hallowe'en\") is a shortened form of \"All Hallow Even,\" meaning \"All Hallows' Eve\" or \"All Saints' Eve.\" Hallowmas, the day after Halloween, is shortened from \"Hallows' Mass,\" and is also known as \"All Hallows' Day\" or \"All Saints' Day.\"\n\nSome important and powerful objects in legends could be referred to as \"hallows\" because of their function and symbolism. The Tuatha de Danaan in Ireland possessed the Four Treasures of Ireland which could be interpreted as \"hallows\": the Spear of Lugh, Stone of Fal, the Sword of Light of Nuada, and The Dagda's Cauldron.\n\nIn the modern period, some neo-pagans believe that the four suits in the Rider-Waite Tarot cards deck (swords, wands, pentacles and cups), which are also a representation of the four classical elements of air, fire, earth and water, are also hallows.\n\nCoronation ceremonies for monarchs still invokes four ritual objects, now represented as the sceptre, sword, ampulla of oil, and crown. Similar objects also appear in Arthurian legends, where the Fisher King is the guardian of four \"hallows\" representing the four elements: a dish (earth), Arthur's sword Excalibur (air), the Holy Lance or spear, baton, or a magic wand (fire), and the Holy Grail (water).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1262528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1262528", "title": "Hidden curriculum", "text": "Hidden curriculum\n\nA hidden curriculum is a side effect of schooling, \"[lessons] which are learned but not openly intended\" such as the transmission of norms, values, and beliefs conveyed in the classroom and the social environment. It should be mentioned that the breaktime is an important part of the hidden curriculum. \nAny learning experience may teach unintended lessons. Hidden curriculum often refers to knowledge gained in primary and secondary school settings, usually with a negative connotation where the school strives for equal intellectual development (as a positive aim). In this sense, a hidden curriculum reinforces existing social inequalities by educating students according to their class and social status. The unequal distribution of cultural capital in a society mirrors a corresponding distribution of knowledge among its students.\n\nEarly workers in the field of education were influenced by the notion that the preservation of the social privileges, interests, and knowledge of one group within the population was worth the exploitation of less powerful groups. Over time this theory has become less blatant, yet its underlying tones remain a contributing factor to the issue of the hidden curriculum.\n\nSeveral educational theories have been developed to help give meaning and structure to the hidden curriculum and to illustrate the role that schools play in socialization. Three of these theories, as cited by Henry Giroux and Anthony Penna, are a structural-functional view of schooling, a phenomenological view related to the \"new\" sociology of education, and a radical critical view corresponding to the neo-Marxist analysis of the theory and practice of education. The structural-functional view focuses on how norms and values are conveyed within schools and how their necessities for the functioning of society become indisputably accepted. The phenomenological view suggests that meaning is created through situational encounters and interactions, and it implies that knowledge is somewhat objective. The radical critical view recognizes the relationship between economic and cultural reproduction and stresses the relationships among the theory, ideology, and social practice of learning. Although the first two theories have contributed to the analysis of the hidden curriculum, the radical critical view of schooling provides the most insight. Most importantly it acknowledges the perpetuated economic and social aspects of education that are clearly illustrated by the hidden curriculum.\n\nVarious aspects of learning contribute to the success of the hidden curriculum, including practices, procedures, rules, relationships, and structures. Many school-specific sources, some of which may be included in these aspects of learning, give rise to important elements of the hidden curriculum. These sources may include, but are not limited to, the social structures of the classroom, the teacher's exercise of authority, rules governing the relationship between teachers and students, standard learning activities, the teacher's use of language, textbooks, audio-visual aids, furnishings, architecture, disciplinary measures, timetables, tracking systems, and curricular priorities. Variations among these sources promote the disparities found when comparing the hidden curricula corresponding to various class and social statuses. \"Every school is both an expression of a political situation and a teacher of politics.\"\n\nWhile the actual material that students absorb through the hidden curriculum is of utmost importance, the personnel who convey it elicit special investigation. This particularly applies to the social and moral lessons conveyed by the hidden curriculum, for the moral characteristics and ideologies of teachers and other authority figures are translated into their lessons, albeit not necessarily with intention. Yet these unintended learning experiences can result from interactions with not only instructors, but also with peers. Like interactions with authority figures, interactions amongst peers can promote moral and social ideals but also foster the exchange of information and are thus important sources of knowledge contributing to the success of the hidden curriculum.\n\nAccording to Merfat Ayesh Alsubaie, the hidden curriculum of heteronormativity is the erasure of LGBTQ identities in the curriculum through the privileging of heterosexual identities. In a quote from Gust Yep, heteronormativity is the \"presumption and assumption that all human experience is unquestionably and automatically heterosexual\". Laws such as \"No Promo Homo\" that prohibit the mention of or teaching about LGBTQ identities are considered to work to reinforce the hidden curriculum of heteronormativity. In addition to No Promo Homo laws, currently over half of the states in the U.S. are not legally mandated to have any sexual education. According to Mary Preston, the lack of sexual education in schools removes LGBTQ identities from the explicit curriculum, and contributes to the hidden curriculum of heteronormativity.\n\nWhen students fall outside the heterosexual norm in schools, some students and teachers have been shown to police students back in line with heteronormative expectations. C. J. Pascoe said policing takes place through the use of bullying behaviors such as the use of words such as \"fag, queer, or dyke\" which are used to shame students with identities outside the norm. Pascoe said the use of LGBTQ slurs forms a \"Fag Discourse.\" The \"Fag Discourse\" in schools upholds heteronormativity as sacred, works to silence LGBTQ voices and places LGBTQ identities to the hidden curriculum.\n\nAlthough the hidden curriculum conveys a great deal of knowledge to its students, the inequality promoted through its disparities among classes and social statuses often invokes a negative connotation. For example, Pierre Bourdieu asserts that education-related capital must be accessible to promote academic achievement. The effectiveness of schools becomes limited when these forms of capital are unequally distributed. Since the hidden curriculum is considered to be a form of education-related capital, it promotes this ineffectiveness of schools as a result of its unequal distribution. As a means of social control, the hidden curriculum promotes the acceptance of a social destiny without promoting rational and reflective consideration. According to Elizabeth Vallance, the functions of hidden curriculum include \"the inculcation of values, political socialization, training in obedience and docility, the perpetuation of traditional class structure-functions that may be characterized generally as social control.\" Hidden curriculum can also be associated with the reinforcement of social inequality, as evidenced by the development of different relationships to capital based on the types of work and work-related activities assigned to students varying by social class.\n\nAlthough the hidden curriculum has negative connotations, it is not inherently negative, and the tacit factors that are involved can potentially exert a positive developmental force on students. Some educational approaches, such as democratic education, actively seek to minimize, make explicit, and/ or reorient the hidden curriculum in such a way that it has a positive developmental impact on students. Similarly, in the fields of environmental education and education for sustainable development, there has been some advocacy for making school environments more natural and sustainable, such that the tacit developmental forces that these physical factors exert on students can become positive factors in their development as environmental citizens.\n\nWhile studies on the hidden curriculum mostly focus on fundamental primary and secondary education, higher education also feels the effects of this latent knowledge. For example, gender biases become present in specific fields of study; the quality of and experiences associated with prior education become more significant; and class, gender, and race become more evident at higher levels of education.\n\nOne additional aspect of hidden curriculum that plays a major part in the development of students and their fates is tracking. This method of imposing educational and career paths upon students at young ages relies on various factors such as class and status to reinforce socioeconomic differences. Children tend to be placed on tracks guiding them towards socioeconomic occupations similar to that of their parents, without real considerations for their strengths and weaknesses. As students advance through the educational system, they follow along their tracks by completing the predetermined courses. For example, this is one of the main factors limiting social mobility in America today.\n\nJohn Dewey explored the hidden curriculum of education in his early 20th century works, particularly his classic, \"\". Dewey saw patterns evolving and trends developing in public schools which lent themselves to his pro-democratic perspectives. His work was quickly rebutted by educational theorist George Counts, whose 1929 book, \"Dare the School Build a New Social Order?\" challenged the presumptive nature of Dewey's works. Where Dewey (and other child development theorists including Jean Piaget, Erik Erikson and Maria Montessori) hypothesized a singular path through which all young people travelled in order to become adults, Counts recognized the reactive, adaptive, and multifaceted nature of learning. This nature caused many educators to slant their perspectives, practices, and assessments of student performance in particular directions which affected their students drastically. Counts' examinations were expanded on by Charles A. Beard, and later, Myles Horton as he created what became the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee.\n\nThe phrase \"hidden curriculum\" was reportedly coined by Philip W. Jackson (\"Life In Classrooms\", 1968). He argued that we need to understand \"education\" as a socialization process. Shortly after Jackson's coinage, MIT's Benson Snyder published \"The Hidden Curriculum,\" which addresses the question of why students—even or especially the most gifted—turn away from education. Snyder advocates the thesis that much of campus conflict and students' personal anxiety is caused by a mass of unstated academic and social norms, which thwart the students' ability to develop independently or think creatively.\n\nThe hidden curriculum has been further explored by a number of educators. Starting with \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\", published in 1972, through the late 1990s, Brazilian educator Paulo Freire explored various effects of presumptive teaching on students, schools, and society as a whole. Freire's explorations were in sync with those of John Holt and Ivan Illich, each of whom were quickly identified as radical educators. Other theorists who have identified the insidious nature of hidden curricula and hidden agendas include Neil Postman, Paul Goodman, Joel Spring, John Taylor Gatto, and others.\n\nMore recent definitions were given by Roland Meighan (\"A Sociology of Education\", 1981):\nThe hidden curriculum is taught by the school, not by any teacher...something is coming across to the pupils which may never be spoken in the English lesson or prayed about in assembly. They are picking-up an approach to living and an attitude to learning.\nand Michael Haralambos (\"Sociology: Themes and Perspectives\", 1991):\nThe hidden curriculum consists of those things pupils learn through the experience of attending school rather than the stated educational objectives of such institutions.\n\nEducational critics Henry Giroux, bell hooks, and Jonathan Kozol also have examined the effects of hidden curriculum.\n\nDevelopmental psychologist Robert Kegan addressed the hidden curriculum of everyday life in his 1994 book \"In Over Our Heads\", which focused on the relation between cognitive development and the \"cognitive demands\" of cultural expectations.\n\nProfessor of communication Joseph Turow, in his 2017 book \"The Aisles Have Eyes\", used the concept to describe acculturation to massive personal data collection; he wrote:\nThe very activities that dismay privacy and anti-discrimination advocates are already beginning to become everyday habits in American lives, and part of Americans' cultural routines. Retailing is at the leading edge of a new \"hidden curriculum\" for American society—teaching people what they have to give up in order to get along in the twenty-first century.\n"}

According to art historian Jeannine Baticle, a series of Jacob and his sons survives in the possession of the Orden Tercera de San Francisco in Lima, Peru, which she describes as a \"fairly close replica\" of the Auckland Zurbarán series. An additional series, \"a more distant and awkward imitation\" by an imitator, is in the possession of the Academia de Bellas Artes in Puebla, Mexico.\n\nIt is not known how the paintings reached England, although some speculate that they may have been captured by English pirates while traveling from the painter's studio in Seville to a buyer in a Spanish colony in the Americas. \n\nThe series is first recorded in 1722 as part of the estate of one William Chapman. It was later owned by London Banker James Mendez, whose heirs sold twelve of the thirteen to Richard Trevor, Bishop of Durham in 1756 for £125. Bishop Trevor, a political liberal and a backer of the Jewish Naturalization Act 1753, acquired the paintings, and redesigned and reconstructed the Long Dining Room at Auckland Palace, as a public statement of his support for Jewish naturalization rights. Although the Bill was quickly repealed, the paintings still hang in the Long Dining at Auckland.\n\nThe portrait of one of Jacob's sons, Benjamin, was sold separately to the Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven; it hangs in Grimsthorpe Castle, Lincolnshire. Bishop Trevor commissioned Arthur Pond to produce a copy painting of \"Benjamin\". It hangs, with Jacob and the other eleven sons, in the Castle's Long Dining Room, which Bishop Trevor rebuilt for the purpose of displaying the pictures.\n\nIn 2001 the Church Commissioners voted to sell the paintings, a decision that was revoked in 2011 following a donation of £15 million by investment manager and philanthropist Jonathan Ruffer; new arrangements placed the paintings, along with the castle, under the Auckland Castle Trust, making them available to the public after centuries during which they hung in a private home where they could be seen only by invited guests or by special arrangement with the Bishop's staff. \n"}

Most were directly linked to the Enlightenment period in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\nEnlightened despots were monarchs who distinguished themselves from despots (in the ordinary sense) by the way they governed; they claimed to rule for the well-being of their subjects. For example, an enlightened despot may focus government priorities on matters of public importance such as healthcare, education, nonviolent population control, or physical infrastructure. He or she may be committed to peaceful relations and may even allow for some democratic decision-making to exist, such as public referendums, but did not propose reforms that would undermine their sovereignty or disrupt social order. As John Stuart Mill articulated: \"Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement.\"\n\nAlthough their reigns were based upon Enlightenment principles, their beliefs about royal power were similar to those of regular despots. Enlightened despots believed that they were destined to be ruler the moment they were born.\n\nEnlightened rulers may have played a part in the abolition of serfdom in Europe.\n\nEmperor Joseph II once said: \"Everything for the people, nothing by the people\".\n\nMost dictatorial regimes portray themselves as enlightened and often tend to regard democratic regimes as messy, inefficient, and corrupt. Additionally, many dictators may attempt to openly spread misinformation about their enlightenment, real or assumed, in an attempt to create a personality cult.\n\nIn the Spanish language the word \"dictablanda\" is sometimes used for a dictatorship that preserves some of the liberties and mechanisms of democracy.\n\nThe most famous enlightened despots in history were:\n\nLike many political classifications, the title of enlightened despot suffers from its inherent subjectivity. In recent history dictators such as Lee Kuan Yew, Josip Broz Tito, António Salazar, Isaias Afwerki, Park Chung-hee, Chiang Kai-shek, Pervez Musharraf, Thomas Sankara, and Muammar Gaddafi can be characterized as enlightened despots. In all of these cases the point of view as to just how \"enlightened\" or \"dictatorial\" they are is largely subjective.\n\nGenerally, dictators who serve in office for a very long period are more likely to be regarded as enlightened because they will often be forced to pay some attention to the public interest in order to remain in power and, more importantly, to be regarded as legitimate. Dictators who hold office for a brief period of time or are simply members of a rotating dictatorial elite (such as those heading some juntas) may have less charismatic authority and prove to be forgettable and are therefore often easier to demonize. In the cases of dictators such as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi their enlightened qualities became apparent only in the wake of the breakdown of state institutions and persecution of religious and ethnic minorities that followed their removal from power.\n\n\n"}

The company is headquartered in New York City and became part of the Estée Lauder Companies in 1998. MAC is an acronym for \"Make-up Art Cosmetics\".\n\nDuring his time as a photographer and makeup artist, co-founder Frank Toskan realized the lack of suitable colours and textures needed to maximize performance and result of makeup for these industries. Further, he realized how limited conventional products in the cosmetic industry were to responding to the needs of the modern woman. For the first time ethnicity in makeup was addressed. Toskan began to craft a niche market in the world of makeup. Family joined forces including brother-in-law and chemist Victor Casale. The Franks created the brand that was “by makeup artists for makeup artist.” They were also were known for creating many vivid and rich colours, for every skin tone, focusing on darker skin tones. MAC very quickly cultivated a following in both the fashion and the retail markets, and was responsible for creating many trends. Initially sold exclusively at the BAY in Canada it quickly expanded to Henry Bendel in New York. Nordstrom department stores welcomed the brand soon after marking MAC's first foray into the mass North American retail market Saks, Macy's, Dillard's, and Bloomingdale's rapidly followed suit as well as dozens of MAC owned stand alone stores. Unsolicited celebrity endorsement was key to MAC's success as Madonna, Mariah Carey, Princess Diana, Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Cher, and Janet Jackson embraced this new world of makeup art. MAC continues to be the leader in creative cosmetic innovation worldwide.\n\nThe company's products were originally intended for makeup professionals, but are sold directly to consumers worldwide. Frank Toskan stated that he \"first manufactured makeup for models, but then the models wanted this makeup for their sisters, friends, and so on... \". Today, the brand continues to work with in fashion show professionals: \"From a niche brand [mainly for photo or film], MAC has become a global brand.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, the brand had over a hundred stores worldwide, earning 200 million francs. The development of the brand internationally, the opening of new points of sale, and the adaptation of product lines tailored to each continent, left little time for the founders to create new products. In 1994, the company Estée Lauder took control of 51% of shares of MAC Cosmetics and began managing the business end while the two founders retained creative control. In 1997, co-founder Frank Angelo died of cardiac arrest during surgery at the age of 49. At that time, MAC had a revenue of US $250 million, which doubled ten years later. Estée Lauder Inc. completed the acquisition in 1998, and Frank Toskan decided to sell his remaining shares shortly thereafter before leaving the company at the end of the same year.\n\nMAC Cosmetics is named one of the top three global makeup brands, with an annual turnover of over $1 billion, and 500 independent stores, with over thirty stores in France. All stores are run by professional makeup artists. MAC is an official makeup brand, used to create makeup for movie actors. The most popular products by the brand are Studio Fix Powder Foundation and Gigablack lash mascara. The most popular lip product by this brand is Viva Glam Lipstick, which became popular due to smooth formula and rich pigmentation. The lipstick was released in 2014.\n\nIn September 2016, MAC Cosmetics launched the \"MAC Selena\" collection in collaboration with the estate of Selena Quintanilla Perez. A petition on Change.org proposed the idea of this collaboration to MAC Cosmetics. Selena's sister, Suzette Quintanilla, worked with MAC to create the perfect collection that really represented Selena. The collection sold out within hours not only at MAC stores but also at other retailers that carried the collection such as Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, and Macy's. Fans stood in line for hours to get their hands on the collection but some did walk away empty handed. Due to the high demand for this collection, MAC restocked the collection in December 2016. Her posthumous collaboration with MAC Cosmetics became the best-selling celebrity collection in the cosmetics history.\n\nIn May 2017, MAC Cosmetics became available for purchase online at Ulta Beauty. Products became available in stores in June 2017.\n\nOn August 24, 2017, MAC Cosmetics announced that a collection involved with the estate of late singer Aaliyah will be made available in the summer of 2018. The Official release date for the \"MAC Aaliyah\" collection will be made available on June 20 online and June 21 in stores. Along with the MAC collection, MAC and i-D Magazine has partnered up to release a short film titled \"A-Z of Aaliyah\" which will coincide with the launch.\n\nIn May 2018, Sephora announced it would be carrying MAC Cosmetics in its stores.\n\nIn September 2018, fans started a petition on Change.org to ask MAC Cosmetics to collaborate with the estate of the late British singer Amy Winehouse for her own make-up collection; \"MAC Amy Winehouse\". After seeing other late female artists Selena and Aaliyah getting their own posthumous lines, fans stated; \"Amy Winehouse's image alone inspires so many looks and trends today and has had a massive impact in women, as well as the society we live in.\" It has been said that the proceeds would go towards the Amy Winehouse Foundation; which raises awareness and helps young vulnerable people struggling with drug/alcohol addiction, as well as mental health issues.\n\nThe MAC AIDS Fund was established in 1994 to support men, women, and children affected by HIV/AIDS globally by addressing the link between poverty and HIV/AIDS. According to MAC Cosmetics, the fund has raised over $400 million through the sale of MAC's Viva Glam Lipsticks and Lipglosses, donating 100% of the sale price to fight HIV/AIDS. The Viva Glam product line has been a best-seller for the MAC Cosmetics brand. MAC has collaborated with many celebrities for its Viva Glam line, on limited edition lip glosses and lipsticks to support the Mac AIDS Fund. Every year MAC selects a new spokesperson for Viva Glam. The first was drag queen RuPaul in 1994. RuPaul’s Viva Glam lipstick was the first product MAC Cosmetics advertised.

It was created by the French Orientalist artist, Jacques Majorelle over almost forty years, starting in 1923, and features a Cubist villa designed by the French architect, Paul Sinoir in the 1930s. The property was the residence of the artist and his wife from 1923 until their divorce in the 1950s. In the 1980s, the property was purchased by the fashion designers, Yves Saint-Laurent and Pierre Bergé who worked to restore it. Today, the garden and villa complex is open to the public. The villa houses the Islamic Art Museum of Marrakech, the Berber Museum and has recently opened the Musee Yves Saint Laurent.\n\nThe Majorelle Garden was designed by the French artist, Jacques Majorelle (1886-1962), son of the Art Nouveau \"ébéniste\" (cabinet-maker) of Nancy, Louis Majorelle. As a young aspiring painter, Jacques Majorelle was sent to Morocco in around 1917 to convalesce from a serious medical condition. After spending a short time in Casablanca, he travelled to Marrakech and like many of his contemporaries, fell in love with the vibrant colours and street life he found there. After travelling around North Africa and the Mediterranean, he eventually decided to settle permanently in Marrakech. \n\nIn 1923, just four years after his marriage to Andrée Longueville, Majorelle purchased a four-acre plot, situated on the border of a palm grove in Marrakech and built a house in the Mooroccan style. In 1931, he commissioned the architect, Paul Sinoir, to design a Cubist villa for the property. Gradually, he purchased additional land, extending his holding by some 10 acres. In the grounds around the residence, Majorelle began planting a luxuriant garden which would become known as the \"Jardins Majorelle\" (Majorelle Garden). The garden became his life's work and he devoted himself to developing it for almost forty years.\n\nThe garden proved costly to run and in 1947, Majorelle opened the garden to the public with an admission fee designed to defray the cost of maintenance. At times, he sold off parcels of land to fund the growing garden. Following his divorce in the 1950s, Majorelle was forced to sell the house and land. After this, the garden was neglected and fell into disrepair. The garden and villa were rediscovered in the 1980s, by fashion designers, Yves Saint-Laurent and Pierre Bergé who set about restoring it and saving it.\nDuring his lifetime, Majorelle earned a reputation as a celebrated Orientalist painter. Though Majorelle's watercolors are largely forgotten today, the gardens remain as his creative masterpiece. The special shade of bold cobalt blue, inspired by the coloured tiles he had seen around Marrakech and in Berber burn-houses, was used extensively in the garden and its buildings and is named after him, \"bleu Majorelle\"—Majorelle Blue. Prior to his death, Majorelle patented the colour which carries his name.\n\nThe gardens and buildings form a complex, where specific buildings are dedicated to various museums and exhibits of interest to visitors. The gardens, which cover two and half acres, are open to the public daily and house an important collection of cacti and sculpture. The villa is home to the Berber Museum and also features a collection of Majorelle's paintings. Majorelle's former studio workshop has become the location of the Islamic Art Museum of Marrakech which features a collection of North African textiles from Saint-Laurent's personal collection as well as ceramics and jewelry. \n\nDevelopment of the garden complex is ongoing. Profits from the gardens are used to fund new projects. In October 2017, the Musee Yves Saint Laurent was opened to the public as a tribute to the designer's legacy and his links with Marrakech. The gardens are a major tourist drawcard in Marrakech, attracting more than 700,000 visitors annually. \n\nSince 2010, the property has been owned by the Foundation Pierre Bergé – Yves Saint Laurent, a French not-for-profit organisation and since 2011 has been managed by the Foundation Jardin Majorelle, a recognized non-profit organization in Marrakech. Pierre Bergé was the director of the Garden's Foundation until his death in September, 2017. \n\nThe garden hosts more than 15 bird species that are endemic to North Africa. It has many fountains, and a notable collection of cacti.\n\nThe garden was owned by Yves Saint-Laurent and Pierre Bergé between 1980 and 2008. After Yves Saint Laurent died in 2008 his ashes were scattered in the Majorelle Garden.\n\n\n"}

The find is currently the only one of its kind of the Single Grave Culture (German: ) in Germany and is in the permanent exhibition of the Archaeological Museum Hamburg in Harburg, Hamburg.\n\nEven before the discovery of the head burial numerous archaeological finds were made in the vicinity due to intensive agricultural land use. The find spot, was located at on a flat hilltop between two fields which has not been used for agriculture. The Metzendorf-Woxdorf head burial has been discovered during levelling work, while taking off soil of the hill with a bulldozer for a pipeline for the local the Metzendorf water supply association. The workers noticed broken ceramic sherds in the plained soil. They stopped their work on this site and reported their discovery to the Helms-Museum. During the following archaeological excavation, a large, upside stored giant beaker (German: ) was uncovered in a depth of , the vessel floor and wall was broken by the levelling work. The giant beaker was put over a foot shell (German: ) which contains the remnains of a single human skull.\n\nThe foot shell was placed on three smaller stones. It was made from a greyish brown clay having a height of and diameters of at the stand and at its mouth. The outside wall of the vessel is irregularly decorated with long parallel impressions of a comb-like tool. Inside, the foot shell was filled up to a height of two-thirds with humus soil on which the skull lay. The giant beaker was placed upside down over the cup. The retracted walls below the mouth of the vessel were carefully framed with larger stones. The giant beaker consists of a brownish-gray to reddish-brown clay. It has a height of with diameters of about at the base and at the mouth. Its largest diameter is to at a height of from the base. The shards of the damaged vessels base could not be recovered. Below the vessels rim, the vessel is decorated with an irregular series of small triangular recesses, whose tips are directed downward. Prior to its discovery the vessel and its interior was intact but it has been damaged with the bulldozer. The shape of the giant beaker corresponds to the Bentheim group, defined by Karl Hermann Jacob Friesen, although this vessel stands out because of its size. Wegewitz interprets the giant beaker as storage vessel. The skull has been preserved from its cranium to the ear bones and nasal bone, while the facial skeleton and jaws were probably decomposed after the funeral. The closed air space inside the large vessel favoured the preservation of the skull as opposed to being stored in well-aerated sandy soil at the site. In the earthy filling of the foot shell a few remains of tooth enamel were found. Due to its small amount Wegewitz suspected that at the times of the funeral only the head and upper jaw were present while the lower jaw and cervical vertebrae were already lost. The skull was anthropologically determined as most likely that of an adult male. Whether the burial was dug in a pit into the ground or settled above the ground could not be determined due to lack of soil discolouration at site. Likewise, it remains unclear whether the head burial was created in close proximity to a possibly nearby or lost full body burial.\n\nDue to typological determination of the ceramic vessels the Metzendorf-Woxdorf head burial was dated to the chalcolithic period, around 2200 BCE.\n\nThe funeral of a single Human head, separated from his body is, unique for the northern German Neolithic so far, it suggests cultural influences from early Bronze Age Bohemia, where such separate head burials in ceramic vessels with their bodies buried underneath were common at the same time. Likewise, giant beakers similar to the Metzendorf-Woxdorf type were widely used there. Similar archaeological finds of giant beakers are known from the Hannoversches Wendland along the river Elbe supporting the theory of cultural ties to Bohemia, but the vessels found in Wendland were always found without content, so that the use as a funeral vessel here appears unlikely.\n\n"}

Founded by 10 women on November 26, 1913 at Hunter College in New York, Phi Sigma Sigma is now an international sorority with 60,000 initiated members, 115 collegiate chapters and more than 100 alumnae chapters, clubs and associations across the United States and Canada.\n\nDelta Phi Epsilon Sorority, founded in 1917, was the first non-sectarian social sorority founded at a professional school.\n\nA 1956 amendment to the constitution of the State of Virginia allowed for tuition grants to be paid by the state to \"nonsectarian private schools\".\n\nBlaine amendments to thirty-eight state constitutions forbid direct government aid to educational institutions that have a religious affiliation. The typical wording, \"religious sects or denominations,\" is most often used to challenge support to Catholic parochial schools (38% of private school attendance); Protestant schools with an undifferentiated \"Christian,\" often get a pass. These schools often claim both \"nonsectarian\" and \"Christian\" in their promotional materials. The United States Department of Education differentiates \"Christian\" from \"Conservative Christian\" in its analyses.\n\nOrganizations that are explicitly nonsectarian include the Apex Clubs of Australia, those participating in the Ethical Culture Movement, International Society for Krishna Consciousness, the National Jewish Medical and Research Center, and the Tibetan Buddhist Center of Philadelphia. In Northern Ireland, nonsectarian refers to groups identifying themselves as neither Nationalist/Republican or Unionist/Loyalist, such as the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland.\n\nSome cemeteries are known for being nonsectarian. In the United States, these are typically Christian cemeteries that do not adhere to one branch of the faith. Interment services can therefore be conducted in accordance with any one of various faith traditions, or none at all.\n\n"}

On-the-job training is highly effective because it uses the existing workplace tools, machines, documents and equipment which simplifies the process of adapting to the new work environment. This type of training is normally used for practical tasks. \nOn-the job training is not the most effective or efficient method however, it is easy to arrange and manage. No transfer of learning is required, and because the training is performed on the job it is highly realistic. On-the-job training is inexpensive and it doesn’t require special equipment but what is normally used for the specific job and does not require a training guide. OTJ is a subject for many researches, highlighting its importance and benefits. A large majority of employee learning is accomplished through on-the-job training. When well designed, OTJ training program provides the needed resources and knowledge from competent staff managers, while setting a performance standards. \n\nOn the job training is one of the earliest forms of training in the United States. The method is used when trained professional is passing his knowledge to the new hire. The OTJ method dates from back in the days when not everyone knew how to read or write, and it was the most convenient way to understand the requirements needed for the new job, on a one-to-one basis. In antiquity, the work performed by most people did not rely on abstract thinking, or academic education. Parents or community members, who knew the skills necessary for survival, passed their knowledge on to the children through direct instruction. This method is still widely used today. It is a frequently used because it requires only a person who knows how to do the task and the tools the person uses to do the task.\nOver the years, as society has grown, on the job training has become less popular. Many companies have switched to doing simulation training, and using training guides. Businesses now prefer to hire employees who are already experienced and have the required skills set. However, there are still many companies who feel that on the job training is the best for their employees. \n\nThe concept of observational learning was introduced by Albert Bandura. Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory. Bandura believes that people learn best by observing others. According to this theory, people must pay attention to those around them first, retain what they have observed, and try to reproduce it. Bandura’s theory is implemented in the aspect of on the job training, where the new employees first observe their trainer completing the necessary tasks, before trying perform them themselves. After observing for some time, typically, they will imitate the action they had observed. This is exactly how on-the-job training is expected to occur, as long as necessary, until the new employee is capable of performing the task on their own.\n\nThere are both advantages and disadvantages to on-the-job training. Companies must weigh out their options before they decide which type of training is most beneficial for their field. If there are more disadvantages than advantages companies must opt out from the OJT and look for better options. In order to clarify these advantages and disadvantages, a list of pros and cons can be found below. \n\n• On the job training is a quick method of training. \n• When a company is short on employees, and needs to hire someone new, they are able to have the employee immediately on the job! \n• It is oftentimes hard to create a simulation of the work environment in a training field. By doing the on the job training, everyone is taught exactly what they will be using on a daily basis.\n• On-the-job training is Cost effective \n\n• One drawback is that OJT takes the trainer and materials out of production for the duration of the training time. \n• On the job training can sometimes cause an issue when the training employees doesn’t have the required skills.\n• On the job training can also cause distractions to the job and affect the productivity \n• In many jobs, there are safety precautions that need to be taught prior to entering the job field. Without employees being properly trained, there could be injuries that occur on the jobsite.\n• On the job training, is oftentimes rushed, which results in low productivity of the employee\n"}

The inventory is called \"opaque\" because the specific suppliers (i.e. hotel, airline, etc.) remain hidden until after the purchase has been completed. This is done to prevent sales of unsold inventory from cannibalizing full-price retail sales. According to TravelClick, the opaque channel accounted for 6% of all hotel reservations for major brands in 2012, up 2% from 2010.\n\nThe primary consumers of opaque inventories are price-conscious people whose primary aim is the cheapest travel possible and are less concerned with the specifics of their travel plans. Hotel discounts of 30-60% are typical, and bargains are stronger at a higher star hotel. While one has control over the dates and times of a travel itinerary, the downside is these purchases are absolutely non-refundable and non-changeable and, as noted above, the specific hotel or airline is not revealed until after purchase.\n\nThe main sources of opaque inventories are Hotwire.com and Priceline.com, but Travelocity.com and Expedia.com also offer opaque booking options. Hotwire has a fixed pricing model, where it sells a room at a fixed price with a limited description of a given venue, whereas Priceline offers both a similar fixed pricing model and a bidding model where travelers bid for a hotel room from among a group of hotels of a given star rating and location. Typically hotel deals are greater than airline discounts on opaque travel sites, namely because airlines have limited seating and also take monetary cuts when publishing discounted fares, whereas a hotel sells to opaque sites to fill empty rooms.\n\nIn response to these opaque travel sites, there are also 'decoder' sites that use feedback from recent purchasers to help construct a profile of the opaque travel property.\n"}
{"id": "20800442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20800442", "title": "Public offering", "text": "Public offering\n\nA public offering is the offering of securities of a company or a similar corporation to the public. Generally, the securities are to be listed on a stock exchange. In most jurisdictions, a public offering requires the issuing company to publish a prospectus detailing the terms and rights attached to the offered security, as well as information on the company itself and its finances. Many other regulatory requirements surround any public offering and they vary according to jurisdiction.\n\nInitial public offering (IPO) is one type of public offering. Not all public offerings are IPOs. An IPO occurs only when a company offers its shares (not other securities) for the first time for public ownership and trading, an act making it a public company. However, public offerings are also made by already-listed companies. The company issues additional securities to the public, adding to those currently being traded. For example, a listed company with 8 million shares outstanding can offer to the public another 2 million shares. This is a public offering but not an IPO. Once the transaction is complete, the company will have 10 million shares outstanding. Non-initial public offering of equity is also called seasoned equity offering.\n\nA shelf prospectus is often used by companies in exactly that situation. Instead of drafting one before each public offering, the company can file a single prospectus detailing the terms of many different securities it might offer in the next several years. Shortly before the offering (if any) actually takes place, the company informs the public of material changes in its finances and outlook since the publication of the shelf prospectus.\n\nOther types of securities, besides shares, can be offered publicly. Bonds, warrants, capital notes and many other kinds of debt and equity vehicles are offered, issued and traded in public capital markets. A private company, with no shares listed publicly, can still issue other securities to the public and have them traded on an exchange. A public company may also offer and list other securities alongside its shares.\n\nMost public offerings are in the primary market, that is, the issuing company itself is the offerer of securities to the public. The offered securities are then issued (allocated, allotted) to the new owners. If it is an offering of shares, this means that the company's outstanding capital grows. If it is an offering of other securities, this entails the creation or expansion of a series (of bonds, warrants, etc.). However, more rarely, public offerings take place in the secondary market. This is called a secondary market offering: existing security holders offer to sell their stake to other, new owners, through the stock exchange. The offerer is different from the issuer (the company). A secondary market offering is still a public offering with much the same requirements, including a prospectus.\n\nThe services of an underwriter are often used to conduct a public offering.\n\n"}
{"id": "8217499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8217499", "title": "Races and nations of Warhammer Fantasy", "text": "Races and nations of Warhammer Fantasy\n\nIn the fictional \"Warhammer Fantasy\" setting by Games Workshop, there are a number of different races and nations. The most important of these feature are individual armies in the Warhammer Fantasy Battle table top game.\n\nAll of the featured human nations are based in the Old World.\n\nBretonnia is based on real-world medieval France; its name is clearly derived from the French province of Britanny and it draws heavily from Arthurian legends which are associated with Medieval Brittany; for instance with The Lady and The Green Knight who both have parallels in Arthurian lore. Though originally received by the Warhammer community as too idealistic for the Warhammer atmosphere, further source books have revealed the underlying arrogance of Bretonnian knights and their casually cruel treatment of their lowborn citizens.\n\nBretonnia was founded when the Knight Lord Giles drove the hordes of Orcs and Chaos out of Bretonnia in the name of the Lady, the goddess in whom the Bretonnians place their faith. Since then Bretonnia has been divided and collectively ruled by the King of Bretonnia and his twelve Dukes and their families. Each Duke, in turn, rules over several barons and earls, each having great swathes of land and are able to call upon dozens of knights from the lesser nobility that they rule.\n\nBretonnia's official religion is the worship of \"The Lady\". However, this religion is only exclusive to the aristocracy, as peasants are considered unworthy to worship Her and any caught doing so are brutally punished.\n\nBretonnian knights train extensively from boyhood in riding and heavy armor combat, specializing in two kinds of weapons, the longsword and the lance; completely abstaining from using ranged weapons, which they consider dishonorable. Their blacksmiths are the best human armorers in the world, second only to the Elves and Dwarfs in craftsmanship. Though indoctrinated in the art of knightly chivalry (similar to that which is practiced in Arthurian legend), Bretonnians generally believe that chivalrous acts and responsibilities only apply to their fellow aristocrats and do not extend the same courtesies and respect to their peasant citizens. Bretonnian knights are born exclusively from the nobility of Bretonnia as peasants cannot afford the cost of the armor and weapons required to be a knight, to say nothing of the upkeep necessary to keep horses and maintain equipment.\n\nSome more well-off peasants may still serve as \"Men-at-arms\" in their lord's forces, each aristocrat being able to raise a few hundred men-at-arms from their peasant tenant families. These part-time soldiers are paid a marginal wage and are provisionally given basic armor and carry pikes or spears as their armaments. Each is also required to wear the livery of his lord's house. Though organized and markedly courageous, they are mostly poorly trained and under-supplied as their lords will rarely spare the time and resources to properly equip them. As such, men-at-arms often rely on salvaged or captured arms and other war gear from the battlefield.\n\nAdditionally, Bretonnian armies are supplemented by the \"Fey Enchantresses\" (women who are mysteriously abducted by fey spirits when they are young, raised by the Lady and endowed with magical powers) and the famed \"Pegasi Riders\" (knights trained to ride highly-temperamental winged horses exclusively raised by Bretonnian breeders and serve as the kingdoms aerial forces). For heavy firepower, Bretonnia has only one major siege weapon, the trebuchet. While boasting impressive range, the siege weapon is as inaccurate to fire as it is cumbersome to load. These are usually kept far to the rear of Bretonnian armies along with their peasant longbowmen who rank even less than Men-at-Arms.\n\nThus, Bretonnian armies rely on powerful charges from their many heavily armed and armored knights in order to achieve victory. Bretonnian knights are arguably the best heavy cavalry in Warhammer Fantasy, along with being the most varied. For support units, they have the Pegasi and the Enchantresses and for basic units, Bretonnian armies can also contain cheap and expendable peasant longbowmen and men-at-arms to serve as fodder.\n\n\n\nThere is an island just off shore of Ind, the equivalent of Sri Lanka, mostly covered by forests on which a High Elf fortress known as the Tower of the Sun is situated. A collection of smaller islands are bunched up close to Ind, one of which has another High Elf outpost known as the Tower of Stars. Separating the Kingdoms of Ind from Grand Cathay is a leg of mountains from the Ogre Kingdoms, the equivalent of the Himalayas, where the Land of the Celestial Dragon Monks is. Just inside the nation of Ind is a coastal city called the City of Spires. The rulers of Ind are said to be attended by many servants and slaves, as well as being wealthy and generous.\n\nThe Sea of Claws is roughly equivalent to the real world Baltic Sea. The Sea is mentioned in many of the settings sourcebooks and maps. Its name comes from its abundance of sea creatures. On the shores of Sea of Claws are Empire, Kislev, Bretonnia, Norsca and also the great city of Marienburg roughly equivalent to 17th century Amsterdam. On the shores of sea is located Norsca city of Olricstaad.\n\nThe Elves were the third civilized race to walk the world. Brought from creation by the Old Ones, the Elves showed an adeptness to magic. Torn asunder many thousands of years ago by a great civil war, there are three major nations of Elves.\n\n\nIn the first edition of the game, there were two other Elven armies noted: the \"Sea Elves\" and the \"Night Elves\". Sea Elves were essentially the Elves of the more practical and worldly Outer Kingdoms of Ulthuan, and the Night Elves are now considered part of the Dark Elves.\n\nThe Dwarfs live in city fortresses dug into the mountains of the Old World. Their Chaos brethren occupy one huge towering city in the lands to the south east of the Old World.\n\n\n\nIn many ways, Chaos Dwarves are the mirror-images of Dwarves. Where Warhammer Dwarves shun most magic (save for Runic magic, which is unique to this race) Chaos Dwarves have embraced it; where Dwarves worship their Ancestor Gods, Chaos Dwarves have turned to the worship of the evil Hashut, Father of Darkness; where Dwarves abhor slavery and \"greenskin\" races (Goblins, Orcs and the like), Chaos Dwarves hold masses of slaves and are allied with or are overlords of many greenskin tribes and peoples. They are even responsible for the creation of the Black Orcs. \n\nChaos Dwarves are depicted as having a rather Mesopotamian look; they wear Assyrian-style armor and sausage-curled beards. The main physical difference between them and ordinary Dwarves is that Chaos Dwarves have long tusks jutting up out of their lower jaws. Their capital city is in the form of a huge ziggurat, called \"Zharr-Naggrund.\" They hate or despise all outsiders, and especially hate other Dwarves, who see their existence as an intolerable dishonor to the Dwarf race, meriting extinction. \n\nChaos Dwarves were introduced through the magazine White Dwarf, and even given a limited rulebook of their own. Unfortunately, the model range never caught on, and was slowly abandoned. However, Games Workshop has recently hinted they may try rereleasing the Chaos Dwarves figurine line much to the enjoyment of its loyal cult following.\n\nFimir are a fantasy race created by Graeme Davis and Jes Goodwin at the end of the 1980s for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP) and the 3rd edition of Warhammer Fantasy Battle (WFB).\n\nInspired by the Fomorians of Celtic myth, they are depicted as humanoid, cyclopean creatures with barbed tails and beak-like snouts, with skins that varied from a dark green to a muddy brown colour. They are described as being part Daemon.\n\nThe Fimir inhabit the wetlands of the Warhammer world, typically within crudely constructed fortifications resembling nothing more than a pile of rocks. From these locations, the Fimir raid the homes of humans, taking captives for daemonic sacrifices. The Fimir loathe sunlight, and are followed by wreaths of mist to shield them from it, and their homes are always shrouded by it.\n\nFimir society is divided into a caste system, consisting of Meargh, the Dirach, the warriors, and the Shearl. The Meargh - also known as witch-hags - are the leaders of Fimir colonies, as well as the only females. A Meargh would typically also be a very powerful user of magic. The Dirach - described as \"daemon-friends\" - are a caste of wizards specialising in the worshipping of Daemons. The warrior caste - consisting of Fimm (warriors), Fianna Fimm (elite warriors), and the various nobles - take the brunt of raiding and fighting. The Shearls - the slaves of a Fimir settlement - exist only to work and die. The ruling Meargh hold the clans together. In the event of a Meargh's death, the Fimir of her stronghold separate, either working as mercenaries for other evil creatures or seeking out another clan to join. However the Meargh is sterile and therefore unable to breed. So as to replenish their numbers the Fimir kidnap young fertile human women to use as breeding stock.\n\nThe Fimir were created at the behest of Games Workshop's then-owner, Bryan Ansell who wanted a race \"to be as distinctive of Warhammer as the Broo are of Runequest\". However, the Fimir did not prove popular, and disappeared with the 4th edition of WFB, although this did give them time to make a guest-starring appearance in Milton Bradley's HeroQuest. Very few (official) sources on Fimir exist and include the WFRP Bestiary, an article in \"White Dwarf\" No. 102, the third edition of WFB (Bestiary and \"Warhammer Armies\") and some references in supplements.\n\nThere are two Fimir miniatures at the \"correct scale\" i.e. a size between 1.8m and 2.1m (in-game scale): Fimir (actually Fimm Warriors) from HeroQuest and some limited edition Fimm Warrior miniatures sold separately. One can also find Fimir by Nick Bibby the size of ogres, although these obviously do not integrate well with the \"correctly\" scaled models. Original concept sketches of the miniatures made by Jes Goodwin represented human-sized creatures and the published characteristics of the Fimir reflected this fact. However, when Nick Bibby started to sculpt the Fimir miniatures, he made them ogre-sized, leading to them being disproportionately weak for the size of their figurine in WFB. It was officially decided that this was the fault of the authors. Ultimately, WFRP was published with Fimir, but the race disappeared from the next edition of WFB.\n\nThe last official appearance of the Fimir was in the WFRP sourcebook \"Marienburg: Sold Down the River\", published in 1999. Since WFRP 2nd edition, the background has been brought into line with WFB and races such as Zoats, Gnomes and Fimir have been quietly dropped. Games Workshop described such races as being in \"interminable hiatus\". In response, several fan-written creations have been published, including a \"Fimir special\" issue 25 of the WFRP fanzine Warpstone.\n\nThere appears to be another reference to the Fimir in UK White Dwarf 310. Where in the article on the Gnoblar Horde, a new army list, there is a background piece on boglars, a sub-species of gnoblar that live in marshes. It says that \"A large tribe in the Marshes of Madness have been rumored to be in alliance with strange, cyclopean creatures.\" While not being specific, this is almost certainly a reference to the Fimir.\n\nThe Fimir were mentioned in the time of Legends novel 'Empire', where creatures matching their description were encountered living in the marshes.\n\nFimir are referenced by name in the \"Marshland\" entry of the terrain rules section of the 8th Edition Warhammer Fantasy Battles rulebook.\n\nThe July 2011 \"Storm of Magic\" supplement has, at last, reintroduced Fimir into the Warhammer tabletop game, in the form of a Dirach wizard called a Balefiend, which can be used as a bound monster by any Warhammer army. The character is now a full-fledged monstrous infantry (i.e. ogre-sized) model, rather than regular infantry.\n\nIn December 2011, Warhammer Forge revealed three new models to be released in Q1 of 2012 as part of the supplement titled Monstrous Arcana.\n\nIn August 2016, a Fimiarch Noble miniature was revealed to be released by Games Workshop's Forge World division.\n\nIn July 2017, it was revealed that the Fimir would be re-appearing in an official Games Workshop tie-in product as a part of the Norscan Faction DLC for Total War: Warhammer.\n\n\nIn recent editions they have been reimagined to have been originally created by the Old Ones, thus being the second civilization to come to the Warhammer world. Preceded by the Old Ones and succeeded by the Elves to aid in their great genetic works, the Slann now lead the Lizardmen through prophesies containing ancient instructions from their gods, who may or may not some day return. The Lizardmen are based on the Aztec and Mayan cultures and are found in the New World, corresponding with ancient Central and South America.\n\nThe tribes of Orcs, Goblins and other Greenskins are spread across the Old World and into the east. They are mostly referred to in general as \"Greenskins\" for obvious reasons. The magic they use is called Waaaagh! and is drawn from the power and energy of excited, bloodthirsty Greenskins armies. A large horde led by a great Orc Leader (or sometimes a Goblin one) of Orcs and/or Goblins is called a Waaagh!\n\nA relative of the Common Goblin is the Gnoblar, which is found living with the Ogre Hordes in the Mountains of Mourn. East of the Mountains of Mourn on the borders of Cathay live the Hobgoblins, a race of greenskins somewhere between a Goblin and an Orc, but more cunning than either. Hobgoblins can also be found as slaves or slavers within realm of the Chaos Dwarves. Smallest in size of all the Greenskin races are the Snotlings, They are considered the lowliest of greenskins and are most often bullied around by their larger, greener cousins.\n\nThe toughest and most disciplined of the Orcs are the Black Orcs. These mean beasts are \"armed to da teef\" and are covered in heavy black armour. This is one reason why they are called Black Orcs, the other being their unusually dark green skin compared to their brethren. The most unusual thing about these Orks is that they take care of their weapons and armour (to an extent), cleaning them after each battle, while the other orcs like to leave pieces of their foes stuck to their gear.\n\nAnother form of Orc are the Savage Orcs, who, rather than use the modern technology of armour, language, and weapons of their cousins, stayed in their primitive savage form. Using mainly stones as their weapons, the Savage Orcs rush madly into battle, some clinging upon wild boars with only their feet. The Savage Orcs put so much faith in their warpaint that it works for intimidation.\n\nThe phrase \"Slaves to Darkness\" is used to cover all those who have fallen under the control of, or pledged themselves to, the Forces of the Chaos gods. While the energies of chaos touch all things magical, there are those who fully give themselves to the deities of this realm, and seek to conquer not just the works of the Old Ones, but the very fabric of reality itself.\n\nThere used to be a combined Chaos Army in the early 1990s, which was later split into the Beasts of Chaos and Hordes of Chaos army books. These books then subdivide the armies of Chaos further into Bestial, Mortal (humans), and Daemonic armies.\n\n\nSkaven or \"Children of the Horned Rat\", are a Chaotic race of rat-men. The Skaven have a general Steampunk motif, in that they use primitive and magic-driven science similar to alchemy and medieval proto-science.\n\nSome Skaven concepts might be inspired by the Old World's view of technology as imbalanced, or knowledge/science not held in check by morals. This is a theme which runs through the background of The Empire, in which wizards, engineers, and Sigmarite priests all try to limit or free themselves from the others influence.\n\nAll undead in the Warhammer world are a result of the black sorceries devised by the first necromancer, Nagash, in the long distant past. The Undead are effectively split into two distinct armies: that of the Tomb Kings which has a strong ancient Egyptian feel with mummies and chariots driven by skeletons, and the army of the Vampire Counts which features vampires, zombies and so forth.\n\n\n\n"}

The theory posits a war being fought between humans and inanimate objects, and all the little annoyances that objects cause throughout the day are battles between the two. The concept was not new in 1948 when humorist Paul Jennings coined this name for it in a piece titled \"Report on Resistentialism\", published in \"The Spectator\" that year and reprinted in \"The New York Times\"; the word is a blend of the Latin \"res\" (\"thing\"), the French \"resister\" (\"to resist\"), and the existentialism school of philosophy. The movement is a spoof of existentialism in general, and Jean-Paul Sartre in particular, Jennings naming the fictional inventor of Resistentialism as Pierre-Marie Ventre. The slogan of Resistentialism is \"Les choses sont contre nous\" (\"Things are against us\").\n\nAs discussed regarding the history of Murphy's law and of similar laws or corollaries such as Finagle's law and Sod's law, the perceived perversity of the universe has long been a subject of comment, and the concept may be as old as humanity.

Conceived by film director Can Togay, he created it on the east bank of the Danube River with sculptor Gyula Pauer to honour the Jews who were killed by fascist Arrow Cross militiamen in Budapest during World War II. They were ordered to take off their shoes, and were shot at the edge of the water so that their bodies fell into the river and were carried away. It represents their shoes left behind on the bank.\n\nThe monument is located on the Pest side of the Danube Promenade in line with where Zoltan Street would meet the Danube if it continued that far, about south of the Hungarian Parliament and near the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; between Roosevelt Square and Kossuth square.\n\n\"The composition titled 'Shoes on the Danube Bank' gives remembrance to the 3,500 people, 800 of them Jews, who were shot into the Danube during the time of the Arrow Cross terror. The sculptor created sixty pairs of period-appropriate shoes out of iron. The shoes are attached to the stone embankment, and behind them lies a 40 meter long, 70 cm high stone bench. At three points are cast iron signs, with the following text in Hungarian, English, and Hebrew: \"To the memory of the victims shot into the Danube by Arrow Cross militiamen in 1944–45. Erected 16 April 2005.\"\n\nMost of the murders along the edge of the River Danube took place around December 1944 and January 1945, when the members of the Arrow Cross Party police (\"Nyilas\") took as many as 20,000 Jews from the newly established Budapest ghetto and executed them along the river bank. Tommy Dick describes one surviving person's story from these operations in his book \"Getting Out Alive\" and testimony.\nIn February 1945, the Soviet forces liberated Budapest.\n\nDuring World War II, Valdemar Langlet, head of the Swedish Red Cross in Budapest, with his wife Nina, and later the diplomat Raoul Wallenberg and 250 coworkers were working around the clock to save the Jewish population from being sent to Nazi concentration camps; this figure later rose to approximately 400. Lars and Edith Ernster, Jacob Steiner, and many others were housed at the Swedish Embassy in Budapest on Üllői Street 2-4 and 32 other buildings throughout the city which Wallenberg had rented and declared as extraterritorially Swedish to try to safeguard the residents.\n\nItalian Giorgio Perlasca did the same, sheltering Jews in the Spanish Embassy.\n\nOn the night of 8 January 1945, an Arrow Cross execution brigade forced all the inhabitants of the building on Vadasz Street to the banks of the Danube. At midnight, Karoly Szabo and 20 policemen with drawn bayonets broke into the Arrow Cross house and rescued everyone (see also front page of 1947 newspaper below). Among those saved were Lars Ernster, who fled to Sweden and became a member of the board of the Nobel Foundation from 1977 to 1988, and Jacob Steiner, who fled to Israel and became a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Steiner's father had been shot dead by Arrow Cross militiamen 25 December 1944, and fell into the Danube. His father had been an officer in World War I and spent four years as a prisoner of war in Russia.\n\nDr. Erwin K.

{"id": "8742596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8742596", "title": "Stolipinovo", "text": "Stolipinovo\n\nStolipinovo () is a district of the Bulgarian city of Plovdiv and the most populous predominantly Romani-inhabited district on the Balkans with a population of about 50,000 people. It is a ghetto located on the outskirts of the city, in its northeastern part on the right bank of the Maritsa.\nStolipinovo differs from other Roma communities in Bulgaria as only 5,000 inhabitants identify themselves as Christian and romani-speaking Roma (\"Dassikane Roma\"), whereas the Muslim and Turkish-speaking majority claims to be of Turkish origin (\"Xoraxane Roma\").\n\nSince the end of the socialist era in 1989 there have been almost no investments in the infrastructure of Stolipinovo. In combination with the boom of illegal housing this led to severe problems with regards to electricity and water supply, sewerage and waste disposal.\n\nDue to accumulated debts for electricity and water surpassing 3 million euro, in 2002 the (then state-owned) local supplier shut down electricity completely for all inhabitants of Stolipinovo. This kind of \"kin liability\" has been widely regarded as illegal by human rights organisations and led to a spontaneous riot. After the situation calmed down, the district was supplied electricity for six hours per night. This regime has not yet been abolished, despite an October 31, 2006, ruling by the Plovdiv Regional Court, that the practice of the Austrian EVN monopolist was \"discriminatory.\" Stolipinovo is unique in having electricity distribution boards raised on poles several metres tall.\n\nSanitation is poor owing to the shortage of safe water, due to burst pipes. Piped water rarely reaches the highest floors of apartment buildings. In most of the illegal buildings there is no water supply at all. The sewers in Stolipinovo are mostly dysfunctional and overflowing, forming puddles in the streets. Illegal buildings are not connected at all. Household waste is typically hurled from windows and balconies of apartments onto heaps on the ground below.\n\nInevitably, these problems caused a hepatitis type A epidemic in the summer of 2006 which affected at least 637 persons in Stolipinovo, and spread to other parts of the city, Sheker Mahala in particular. As a result, RIOKOZ of the Ministry of Health completed a mass immunisation campaign of children in Plovdiv by the end of October 2006. Other emergency measures undertaken by the municipality included dismantlement of illegal kiosks that had lined the streets and disposal of refuse left uncollected for years.\n\nThe nonpayment of the bills for household services leads to accumulation of a debt that amounts to 3 million EUR for electricity and water supply. Due to this reason, in 2002 the local electricity company /by that time state-owned/ began cutting off the electricity supply of all inhabitants of Stolipinovo. This “joint responsibility” was considered as illegal approach by the human rights organizations and led to spontaneous riots in Stolipinovo. After the situation was all set up, the neighbourhood was put on a regime – electricity supply was on for six hours at night. The state company also decided to place electricity meters in exterior boards that were fixed several meters above the ground – something that appears to be a practice in the neighbourhoods inhabited with Roma people in Bulgaria. On October 31, 2006 the District Court in Plovdiv pronounced a decision, with which the electricity regime in Stolipinovo was proclaimed discriminatory.\n\nThe overcoming of this humanitarian and economic problem, which had been neglected for many years, was undertaken by EVN Bulgaria – a subsidiary of the Austrian utility company, which in 2004 acquired the Electricity Distributing Companies in South Eastern Bulgaria and inherited the debts, the regime, the damaged electricity grid, and the problematic relations with the clients. Company’s experts prepared a complete technical project, a programme for public-private partnership and an information campaign, the implementation of which took almost a year. The electricity grid was entirely renovated, including the installation of new on-ground boards, which allows a visual control on the readings of the electricity meters on behalf of the clients.\n\nThe project paid attention also to activities for improvement of the supplier-client relations. The old payments were stretched out according to a socially bearable scheme. Within the work on the project a lot of families, who had previously been illegally joined to the grid, were separated as new subscribers in compliance with the legal requirements. On one hand this improved the relations with the clients, and on the other restored their faith in the company. EVN appointed Romani people to consulting positions working in the neighbourhood. Their obligations are to consult the clients upon comprehending the readings of their electricity meters as well as to carry out information campaigns directed to energy efficiency. Company’s cash desks facilitating payments were opened in the neighbourhood.\n\nAs a result, since 2007 the Roma community in Stolipinovo has started receiving 24-hour electricity supply. About 3 million EUR has been invested in the entire replacement of 185 kilometers of electricity grid, renovation or construction of a total of 17 transformer stations, opening of 4 cash desks on the territory of the neighbourhood, joining 6 400 subscribers to the grid. Success has been achieved, which few believed in before: the collectability in the neighbourhood has been raised from 3% in 2006 to 85% after the fulfillment of the project, and the technological losses decreased from 40% to 5%. The success in Stolipinovo reassured the management of EVN Bulgaria to apply the programme in other Roma-inhabited neighbourhoods on the territory of South Eastern Bulgaria and to ensure electricity supply according to all present-day standards.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "583461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=583461", "title": "Stratum (linguistics)", "text": "Stratum (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, a stratum (Latin for \"layer\") or strate is a language that influences, or is influenced by another through contact. A substratum or substrate is a language that has lower power or prestige than another, while a superstratum or superstrate is the language that has higher power or prestige. Both substratum and superstratum languages influence each other, but in different ways. An adstratum or adstrate refers to a language that is in contact with another language in a neighbor population without having identifiably higher or lower prestige. The notion of \"strata\" was first developed by the Italian linguist Graziadio Isaia Ascoli (1829–1907), and became known in the English-speaking world through the work of two different authors in 1932.\n\nThus, both terms refer to a situation where an intrusive language establishes itself in the territory of another, typically as the result of migration. Whether the superstratum case (the local language persists and the intrusive language disappears) or the substratum one (the local language disappears and the intrusive language persists) applies will normally only be evident after several generations, during which the intrusive language exists within a diaspora culture. In order for the intrusive language to persist (\"substratum\" case), the immigrant population will either need to take the position of a political elite or immigrate in significant numbers relative to the local population (i. e., the intrusion qualifies as an invasion or colonisation; an example would be the Roman Empire giving rise to Romance languages outside Italy, displacing Gaulish and many other Indo-European languages). The \"superstratum\" case refers to elite populations that eventually adopt the language of the lower classes. An example would be the Burgundians and Franks in France, who eventually abandoned their Germanic dialects in favor of other Indo-European languages of the Romance branch, profoundly influencing the local speech in the process.\n\nA substratum (plural: substrata) or substrate is a language that influences an intrusive language that supplants it. The term is also used of substrate interference; i.e. the influence the substratum language exerts on the replacing language. According to some classifications, this is one of three main types of linguistic interference: substratum interference differs from both adstratum, which involves no language replacement but rather mutual borrowing between languages of equal \"value\", and superstratum, which refers to the influence a socially dominating language has on another, receding language that might eventually be relegated to the status of a substratum language.\n\nIn a typical case of substrate interference, a Language A occupies a given territory and another Language B arrives in the same territory (brought, for example, with migrations of population). Language B then begins to supplant language A: the speakers of Language A abandon their own language in favor of the other language, generally because they believe that it will help them achieve certain goals within government, the workplace, and in social settings. During the language shift, however, the receding language A still influences language B (for example, through the transfer of loanwords, place names, or grammatical patterns from A to B).\n\nIn most cases, the ability to identify substrate influence in a language requires knowledge of the structure of the substrate language. This can be acquired in numerous ways:\n\nOne of the first-identified cases of substrate influence is an example of a substrate language of the second type: Gaulish, from the ancient Celtic people the Gauls. The Gauls lived in the modern French-speaking territory before the arrival of the Romans, namely the invasion of Julius Caesar's army. Given the cultural, economic and political advantages that came with being a Latin speaker, the Gauls eventually abandoned their language in favor of the language brought to them by the Romans, which evolved in this region until eventually it took the form of the French language that is known today. The Gaulish speech disappeared in the late Roman era, but remnants of its vocabulary survive in some French words (approximately 200) as well as place-names of Gaulish origin. It is also posited that some structural changes in French were shaped at least in part by Gaulish influence including diachronic sound changes and sandhi phenomena due to the retention of Gaulish phonetic patterns after the adoption of Latin, calques such as \"aveugle\" (\"blind\", literally without eyes, from Latin \"ab oculis\", which was a calque on the Gaulish word \"exsops\" with the same semantic construction as modern French) with other Celtic calques possibly including \"oui\", the word for yes, while syntactic and morphological effects are also posited.\n\nOther examples of substrate languages are the influence of the now extinct North Germanic Norn language on the Scots dialects of the Shetland and Orkney islands. In the Arab Middle East and North Africa, colloquial Arabic dialects, most especially Levantine, Egyptian, and Maghreb dialects, often exhibit significant substrata from other regional Semitic (especially Aramaic), Iranian, and Berber languages. Yemeni Arabic has Modern South Arabian, Old South Arabian and Himyaritic substrata.\n\nTypically, Creole languages have multiple substrata, with the actual influence of such languages being indeterminate.\n\nIn the absence of all three lines of evidence mentioned above, linguistic substrata may be difficult to detect. Substantial indirect evidence is needed to infer the former existence of a substrate. The nonexistence of a substrate is difficult to show, and to avoid digressing into speculation, burden of proof must lie on the side of the scholar claiming the influence of a substrate. The principle of uniformitarianism and results from the study of human genetics suggest that many languages have formerly existed that have since then been replaced under expansive language families, such as Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Uralic or Bantu. However, it is not a given that such expansive languages would have acquired substratum influence from the languages they have replaced.\n\nSeveral examples of this type of substratum have still been claimed. For example, the earliest form of the Germanic languages may have been influenced by a non-Indo-European language, purportedly the source of about one quarter of the most ancient Germanic vocabulary. There are similar arguments for a Sanskrit substrate, a Greek one, and a substrate underlying the Sami languages. Relatively clear examples are the Chude, Merya, Muromian and Meshcheran languages: while unattested, their existence has been noted in medieval chronicles, and one or more of them have left substantial influence in the Northern Russian dialects. By contrast more contentious cases are the Vasconic substratum theory and Old European hydronymy, which hypothesize large families of substrate languages across western Europe. Some smaller-scale unattested substrates that remain under debate involve alleged extinct branches of the Indo-European family, such as \"Nordwestblock\" substrate in the Germanic languages, and a \"Temematic\" substrate in Balto-Slavic (proposed by Georg Holzer).\n\nWhen a substrate language or its close relatives cannot be directly studied, their investigation is rooted in the study of etymology and linguistic typology. The study of unattested substrata often begins from the study of \"substrate words\", which lack a clear etymology. Such words can in principle still be native inheritance, lost everywhere else in the language family; but they might in principle also originate from a substrate. The sound structure of words of unknown origin — their phonology and morphology — can often suggest hints in either direction. So can their meaning: words referring to the natural landscape, in particular indigenous fauna and flora, have often been found especially likely to derive from substrate languages. None of these conditions, however, is sufficient by itself to claim any one word as originating from an unknown substratum. Occasionally words that have been proposed to be of substrate origin will be found out to have cognates in more distantly related languages after all, and therefore likely native: an example is Proto-Indo-European \"*mori\" 'sea', found widely in the northern and western Indo-European languages, but in more eastern Indo-European languages only in Ossetic.\n\nA superstratum (plural: superstrata) or superstrate offers the counterpart to a substratum. When one language succeeds another, linguists label the succeeding language a superstratum and the earlier language a substratum.\n\nA superstrate may also represent an imposed linguistic element akin to what occurred with English and Norman after the Norman Conquest of 1066 when use of the English language carried low prestige. The international scientific vocabulary coinages from Greek and Latin roots adopted by European languages (and subsequently by other languages) to describe scientific topics (sociology, zoology, philosophy, botany, medicine, all \"-logy\" words, etc.) can also be termed a superstratum, although for this last case, \"adstratum\" might be a better designation (despite the prestige of science and of its language). In the case of French, for example, Latin is the superstrate and Gaulish the substrate.\n\nSome linguists contend that Japanese (and Japonic languages in general) consists of an Altaic superstratum projected onto an Austronesian substratum. Some scholars also argue for the existence of Altaic superstrate influences on varieties of Chinese spoken in Northern China. In this case, however, the superstratum refers to influence, not language succession. Alternate views detect \"sub\"strate effects.\n\nAn adstratum (plural: adstrata) or adstrate is a language that through its prestige is a source of lexical borrowings to another. Generally, the term is used about languages in particular geolinguistic or geopolitical contexts. For example, early in England's history, Old Norse contributed an adstrate to the lexical structure of Old English.\n\nThe phenomenon is less common today in standardized linguistic varieties and more common in colloquial forms of speech since modern nations tend to favour one single linguistic variety (often corresponding to the dialect of the capital and other important regions) over others. In India, where dozens of languages are widespread, many languages could be said to share an adstratal relationship, but Hindi is certainly a dominant adstrate in North India. A different example would be the sociolinguistic situation in Belgium, where the French and Dutch languages have roughly the same status, and could justifiably be called adstrates to each other having each one provided a remarkable set of lexical specifications to the other.\n\nThe term is also used to identify systematic influences or a layer of borrowings in a given language from another language independently of whether the two languages continue coexisting as separate entities. Many modern languages have an appreciable adstratum from English due to the cultural influence and economic preponderance of the United States on international markets and previously colonization by the British Empire which made English a global lingua franca. The Greek and Latin coinages adopted by European languages (including English and now languages worldwide) to describe scientific topics (sociology, medicine, anatomy, biology, all the '-logy' words, etc.) are also justifiably called adstrata. Another example is found in Spanish and Portuguese, which contain a heavy Semitic (particularly Arabic) adstratum; and Yiddish, which is a linguistic variety of High German with adstrata from Hebrew and Aramaic, mostly in the sphere of religion, and Slavic languages, by reason of the geopolitical contexts Yiddish speaking villages lived through for centuries before disappearing during the Holocaust.\n\n\n"}
