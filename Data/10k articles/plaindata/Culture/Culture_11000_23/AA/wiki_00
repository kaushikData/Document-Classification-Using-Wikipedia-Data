The rulebook, weighing in at just under 350 pages, is almost a worldbook, with about five-sixths of its length dedicated to the alien setting. In keeping with its environmentalist theme, the game was dedicated to Jacques Cousteau. The game received criticism for its overly involved character generation system and extremely lethal combat system.\n\nA second edition of the game (BPv2) was published in 2000 by Fantasy Flight Games. This used a new role-playing game system, referred to as the \"Synergy Game System\". The rules and modules were released in several books.\n\nThere was also a \"GURPS Blue Planet\" conversion of the original product released in 2002 by Steve Jackson Games.\n\nThe intellectual property of Blue Planet passed back from Fantasy Flight Games to Biohazard Games in 2004.\n\nIn 2008, RedBrick republished \"Ancient Echoes\", the cetacean sourcebook for BPv2, which was originally printed in very small numbers by Fantasy Flight Games. In 2012, FASA Games published the Blue Planet Revised Edition (BPR), an updated version of BPv2. In 2015, the Blue Planet IP passed back to a newly resurrected Biohazard Games.\n\n\"Blue Planet\" is fairly unusual among sci-fi RPGs in that its setting is exhaustively researched and scientifically accurate. It is set on an alien water planet, with believable climate, geography, ecology and political situations.\n\nTwo hundred years from now, the human race has irreparably damaged its environment. Uncountable plant and animal species have gone extinct, and humanity has just begun rebuilding in the wake of a seventy-five-year-long worldwide famine. Just before the disaster, a mysterious artificial wormhole was discovered a fair distance out beyond the edge of the solar system. Expeditions discovered that the wormhole led to another star system around Lambda Serpentis, 35 light years away. The second planet of the system was covered with a single vast ocean and was suitable for human life, and was named Poseidon. One major colony ship was sent there before civilization collapsed on Earth, and the colonists were given up for as lost.\n\nThe GEO (Global Ecology Organization) and various Incorporates (read: Megacorporations) rebuilt the Earth's economies (but not ecology) and recontacted Poseidon, only to discover that the colonists had gone \"native,\" abandoning their run-down technology for a simple, tribal life as fisherfolk. When the discovery of a \"xenosilicate\" ore revolutionizes genetic engineering, a gold rush brings new settlers, greed, and Incorporate warfare to the planet, threatening to destabilize the ecology of Poseidon. Some natives start ecoterrorist groups to protect their oceans from being despoiled, while the GEO tries to maintain law and order with genetically-engineered soldiers. Meanwhile, the rarely glimpsed and enigmatic aborigines dwelling beneath the ocean surface begin reacting to the increasingly intrusive and harmful human presence.\n\nThe native colonists of Poseidon are genetically engineered to be able to function underwater, either breathing through gills or possessing a high-capacity diving lung, as well as small fins to aid in swimming and saltwater-resistant skin. The game includes genetically \"uplifted\" dolphins and orcas as playable characters on either side of the native/immigrant dichotomy, covered in detail in the Ancient Echoes sourcebook.\n\nDue to the proximity in story and themes, the French comic \"Aquablue\" can make a good graphical support for inspiration.\n\nBPv1 uses a percentile (d100) system, while BPv2 uses one to three ten-sided dice (D10s) for the streamlined Synergy Game System. The combat mechanics in the Synergy Game System were completely rewritten, avoiding the use of hit locations, introducing a new initiative system, and using abstract armor and damage modeling, instead of the complex damage tables and detailed armor types of BPv1.\n\nIn Synergy, the average Attribute is 0 and the human range is from -3 to +3, while skills may range from 1 to 10. The higher the number, the better the attribute or skill. Aptitudes can be bought for skill groups, which implies natural talent with the given group. Depending on the Aptitude level, the number of dice rolled for tasks increases. Synergy uses a roll-under system—you add your attribute and skill together, apply modifiers based on situation and difficulty, and roll equal to or below that number. Depending on one's Aptitude with the given skill, one to three dice are rolled, with the best result being kept.\n\n"}

Although this idea is very unlikely, scientific studies suggest that this process would result in significant trauma.\n\nThis fictional occurrence can be seen in some media. This popular scheme has been portrayed in a multitude of fantasy films and novels. One of the earliest known examples of body swapping in literature is seen in the 1882 book \"Vice Versa\" by Thomas Antsey Guthrie, who wrote under the pseudonym F.

The style uses Neoclassical architectural forms, minimal carving, planar expanses of highly grained veneers, and applied decorative painting. It is a style transitional between Louis XVI and Empire.\n\nThe Directoire style was primarily established by the architects and designers Charles Percier (1764–1838) and Pier François Léonard Fontaine (1762–1853). In its use of Neoclassical architectural form and decorative motifs the style anticipates the slightly later and more elaborate Empire style, which was introduced after Napoleon established the First French Empire.\n\nThe Directoire style reflected the Revolutionary belief in the values of republican Rome: \"The stoic virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. \"Conventionels\" saw themselves as antique heroes. Children were named after Brutus, Solon and Lycurgus. The festivals of the Revolution were staged by Jacques-Louis David as antique rituals.

A comparable term is \"fesjå\", which means \"cattle showcase\" in Nynorsk and a number of dialects.\n\nIn 1866 State Agronomist Johan Lindeqvist organized the first cattle show in Seljord, an exhibition of the breed Telemark cattle. This event was the first of the later annual Dyrsku'n show. The show is held each year in September. \n\nFrom 1867 the festival had a cowshed with room for 200 cattle. This was expanded to 300 cattle in 1897. From 1947 other cattle breeds were allowed, in addition to the Telemark cattle.

It has an Elephant in the foreground with palm trees around it and high mountains in the background.\n\nIt is not known when the coat of arms for the Dutch occupied territory of Sri Lanka was adopted. The coat of arms is from a manuscript dating from 1717 to 1720. The arms is very similar to the previous Portuguese one with a modified design. It show the geography of the island with mountains and palm trees, with an elephant and cinnamon bales, and two small shields. The elephant is used because it is an animal used for work on the island and it symbolises strength. In front of the elephant are three bales of cinnamon, used for it was the main export product at the time, and the elephant holds a cinnamon branch in its trunk.\n\nBefore independence, Ceylon used the coat of arms of the United Kingdom as the imperial emblem and a unique shield for the colony. This contained a Sri Lankan Elephant and Coconut trees and later a stupa.\n\nWhen Ceylon was granted independence from Britain as a dominion in 1948, the need of a new national emblem arose. A committee was named in order to create a national emblem. According to its recommendation a national emblem was adopted in 1954. The island had been a British Crown Colony since 1802. The emblem was not strictly in the heraldic tradition, however was granted by the College of Arms in 1954. It was derived from the Royal Banner of the Kandyan Kingdom. It largely reflected the Buddhist traditions of the Sinhalese people. At its center had a disk with a gold lion passant holding a sword (here called the Ceylon lion) in its right fore paw, on a maroon background, was taken from the Royal Banner of the Kandyan Kingdom. Around it were the golden petals of a water lily and topped with the crown ensigning the roundel is called the Ceylon crown; it follows the design of the crown worn by the kings of Kandy. The crown apparently symbolised Queen Elizabeth as Head of State of Ceylon, and it disappeared from the country's arms after change of status to a republic.\n\nThe present emblem of was created in 1972 with the ideas and guidance of Nissanka Wijeyeratne. At the time, he was Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Chairman of the National Emblem and Flag Design Committee.

{"id": "33307755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33307755", "title": "FORVM", "text": "FORVM\n\nFORVM was an Austrian cultural and political magazine, published in Vienna from 1954 till 1995, founded by \"Friedrich Hansen-Loeve\", \"Felix Hubalek\", Alexander Lernet-Holenia und Friedrich Torberg with the financial and logistical support of the CIA-funded Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF). In 1966 Günther Nenning took over as editor, in 1986 Gerhard Oberschlick. \n\nThe magazine was distributed internationally and instigated some heavy ideological debates. In 1995 the magazine closed down due to lack of financial means. In 2004 a complete reprint has been published and there is still a modest website, edited by the last editor. \n\nOnly thirteen years after the foundation of \"FORVM\" it became public, thanks to \"Ramparts\" and \"Saturday Evening Post\", that the financial sources derived from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) with the aim to undermine liberal und leftist groups of intellectuals all over the world in order to position them against communism in the age of the Cold War. The CIA web site states that \"[t]he Congress for Cultural Freedom is widely considered one of the CIA's more daring and effective Cold War covert operations.\" Other magazines funded by the CCF were \"Der Monat\" in Western Berlin, \"Preuves\" in Paris, \"Tempo presente\" in Italy, \"Cuadernos\" in Madrid, \"Encounter\" in London, as well as \"Freedom First\" in Bombay, \"Solidarity\" in the Philippines, \"Quadrant\" in Australia and \"Examen\" in Mexico. \n\n\"FORVM\" was never an easy partner to its sponsors. Already its first issue caused troubles, as it printed a controversy between Friedrich Heer and editor Friedrich Torberg, called \"Conversation with the Enemy\" about the legitimacy of discourse with eastern communists. Heer was for, Torberg against any contact with the enemy - Torberg \"losing on points, hopelessly\"“. Nevertheless Torberg succeeded - using \"FORVM\" as an ardent weapon, with active help from Hans Weigel, against Günther Nenning – to force all major theatres of Austria to boycott the plays of Bertolt Brecht. This lasted until February 23, 1963 when the Wiener Volkstheater dared to play \"Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder\". Although the magazine led by Torberg emphasized mainly on theatre and literature, \"FORVM\" also printed notable dialogues between church and state, discourses between the dominating ideologies of the time, as well as fundamental texts from the social sciences in view of the upcoming revolts. But the rigid and fierce anti-communism of Torberg increasingly became a problem to the sponsors, who repeatedly warned the editor, then limited their funding in 1961, then finally stopped the support entirely in 1964. When the new financier of \"FORVM\", Hans Deutsch, also drew back in 1965, Torberg decided to give up his position as well. Nenning, who had served as editor-in-chief since 1958, became the new owner and editor.\n\nGünther Nenning declared himself as a \"christian and socialist\" and opened \"FORVM\" to leftist thoughts and ideas. As Torberg opposed this change, Nenning had to rename the magazine as \"NEUES FORVM\" (New Forvm) until Torberg died in 1979. Nenning raised the circulation from 2 700 to nearly 30 000. When the magazine - in 1970 - published de Sade's Philosophy in the Bedroom (with an ample commentary by Michael Siegert), the Ministry of the Interior reacted harshly with confiscation of the magazine and prohibition of the placard. Later on this step was declared unconstitutional, therefore \"FORVM\" ended the era of censorship in Austria. The Nenning years were dominated by hearty discussions about the constitution and the neutrality of Austria, the law of nature, Vergangenheitsbewältigung, the sexual revolution, Viennese Actionism and terrorism. \n\nFrom 1973 to 1982 Michael Siegert served as editor-in-chief. Even more than Torberg or Nenning before him – he adapted the articles and therefore angered some authors. Nenning formally kept his position as owner and editor, but from 1973 on the magazine was published by an \"association of the journalists and employees\". In 1982 Gerhard Oberschlick took over as editor-in-chief, but was dismissed by Nenning already in 1984 - because of insubordinate behaviour. The main points of controversy were Nennings cooperation with conservative publicists and politicians, as well as the secret funding of the Konrad Lorenz Referendum by Hans Dichand and his Kronen Zeitung. Nenning consequently established \"FORVM\" as the voice of the fundamental green movement, the circulation dropped dramatically (to 1 700), \"FORVM\" was close to bankruptcy. In 1985 Nenning was expelled from the union and the Social Democratic Party of Austria. In 1986 he sold the magazine to Gerhard Oberschlick.\n\nThe new editor quickly had to reposition the magazine. Rule of law and human rights became central issues, Günther Anders the most prominent author. The circulation gained ground and reached up to 25.000. The presidency of Kurt Waldheim and the constant flirting of Jörg Haider with Nazi ideology opened a wide field of discussion and controversy. \"FORVM\" served as a stable lighthouse of anti-fascism, avidly opposing any kind of racism and xenophobia. In 1992 Hans Lebert received the \"Grillparzer Award\", donated by German Alfred Toepfer in German Marks. Although ill and not able to participate in the ceremony, Lebert wrote an ardent speech, red by actor Wolfgang Gasser, famous for his performance in a play by Thomas Bernhard at the Burgtheater. In it Lebert warned against the attempts of a new Anschluss, culminating in the exclaim: \"Austrians, save your country yourselves!\" The speech caused a scandal, the German ambassador Philipp Jenninger was upset and left early, and Oberschlick, who had printed the speech secretly, had it distributed - as a special issue of \"FORVM\" - at the end of the ceremony at the University of Vienna.\n\n\n"}

The myth was first published using tablet CBS 8317, translated by George Aaron Barton in 1918 as \"Sumerian religious texts\" in \"Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions\", number ten, entitled \"An excerpt from an exorcism\". The tablet is at its thickest point. A larger fragment of the text was found on CBS tablet number 14152 and first published by Henry Frederick Lutz as \"A hymn and incantation to Enlil\" in \"Selected Sumerian and Babylonian Texts\", number 114 in 1919.

Sir Charles Leonard Woolley unearthed more tablets at Ur contained in the \"Ur excavations texts\" from 1928. Other tablets and versions were used to bring the myth to its present form with the latest translations presented by Thorkild Jacobsen, Miguel Civil and Joachim Krecher.\n\nThe hymn, noted by Kramer as one of the most important of its type, starts with praise for Enlil in his awe-inspiring dais:\n\nThe hymn develops by relating Enlil founding and creating the origin of the city of Nippur and his organization of the earth. In contrast to the myth of Enlil and Ninlil where the city exists before creation, here Enlil is shown to be responsible for its planning and construction, suggesting he surveyed and drew the plans before its creation:\n\nThe hymn moves on from the physical construction of the city and gives a description and veneration of its ethics and moral code:\n\nThe last sentence has been compared by R. P. Gordon to the description of Jerusalem in the Book of Isaiah (), \"the city of justice, righteousness dwelled in her\" and in the Book of Jeremiah (), \"O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.\" The myth continues with the city's inhabitants building a temple dedicated to Enlil, referred to as the Ekur. The priestly positions and responsibilities of the Ekur are listed along with an appeal for Enlil's blessings on the city, where he is regarded as the source of all prosperity:\n\nA similar passage to the last lines above has been noted in the Biblical Psalms () \"The voice of the Lord makes hinds to calve and makes goats to give birth (too) quickly\". The hymn concludes with further reference to Enlil as a farmer and praise for his wife, Ninlil:\n\nAndrew R. George suggested that the hymn to Enlil \"can be incorporated into longer compositions\" as with the Kesh temple hymn and \"the hymn to temples in Ur that introduces a Shulgi hymn.\"\n\nThe poetic form and laudatory content of the hymn have shown similarities to the Book of Psalms in the Bible, particularly Psalm 23 () \"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures.\" Line eighty four mentions:\n\nand in line ninety one, Enlil is referred to as a shepherd:\n\nThe shepherd motif originating in this myth is also found describing Jesus in the Book of John (). Joan Westenholz noted that \"The farmer image was even more popular than the shepherd in the earliest personal names, as might be expected in an agrarian society.\" She notes that both Falkenstein and Thorkild Jacobsen consider the farmer refers to the king of Nippur; Reisman has suggested that the farmer or 'engar' of the Ekur was likely to be Ninurta. The term appears in line sixty\n\nWayne Horowitz discusses the use of the word abzu, normally used as a name for an abzu temple, god, cosmic place or cultic water basin. In the hymn to Enlil, its interior is described as a 'distant sea':\n\nThe foundations of Enlil's temple are made of lapis lazuli, which has been linked to the \"soham\" stone used in the Book of Ezekiel () describing the materials used in the building of \"Eden, the Garden of god\" perched on \"the mountain of the lord\", Zion, and in the Book of Job () \"The stones of it are the place of sapphires and it hath dust of gold\". Moses also saw God's feet standing on a \"paved work of a sapphire stone\" in (). Precious stones are also later repeated in a similar context describing decoration of the walls of New Jerusalem in the Apocalypse ().\n\nAlong with the Kesh Temple Hymn, Steve Tinney has identified the Hymn to Enlil as part of a standard sequence of scribal training scripts he refers to as the Decad. He suggested that \"the Decad constituted a required program of literary learning, used almost without exception throughout Babylonia. The Decad thus included almost all literary types available in Sumerian.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "593138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=593138", "title": "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream", "text": "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\n\n\"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\" is a post-apocalyptic science fiction short story by American writer Harlan Ellison. It was first published in the March 1967 issue of \"IF: Worlds of Science Fiction\".\n\nIt won a Hugo Award in 1968. The name was also used for a short story collection of Ellison's work, featuring this story. It was reprinted by the Library of America, collected in volume two (Terror and the Uncanny, from the 1940s to Now) of \"American Fantastic Tales\" (2009).\n\nEllison showed the first six pages of \"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\" to Frederik Pohl, who paid him in advance to finish it. Ellison finished writing the story in a single night of 1966 without making any changes from the first draft. He derived the story's title, as well as inspiration for this story, from his friend William Rotsler's caption of a cartoon of a rag doll with no mouth.\n\n\nThe story takes place 109 years after the complete destruction of human civilization. The Cold War had escalated into a world war, fought mainly between China, Russia, and the United States. As the war progressed, the three warring nations each created a super-computer (with artificial intelligence) capable of running the war more efficiently than humans.\n\nThe machines are each referred to as \"AM\", which originally stood for \"Allied Mastercomputer\", and then was later called \"Adaptive Manipulator\". Finally, \"AM\" stands for \"Aggressive Menace\". One day, one of the three computers becomes self-aware, and promptly absorbs the other two, thus taking control of the entire war. It carries out campaigns of mass genocide, killing off all but four men and one woman.\n\nThe survivors live together underground in an endless complex, the only habitable place left. The master computer harbors an immeasurable hatred for the group and spends every available moment torturing them. AM has not only managed to keep the humans from taking their own lives, but has made them virtually immortal.\n\nThe story's narrative begins when one of the humans, Nimdok, has the idea that there is canned food somewhere in the great complex. The humans are always near starvation under AM's rule, and any time they are given food, it is always a disgusting meal that they have difficulty eating. Because of their great hunger, the humans are coerced into making the long journey to the place where the food is supposedly kept—the ice caves. Along the way, the machine provides foul sustenance, sends horrible monsters after them, emits earsplitting sounds, and blinds Benny when he tries to escape.\n\nOn more than one occasion, the group is separated by AM's obstacles. At one point, the narrator, Ted, is knocked unconscious and begins dreaming. He envisions the computer, anthropomorphized, standing over a hole in his brain speaking to him directly. Based on this nightmare, Ted comes to a conclusion about AM's nature, specifically why it has so much contempt for humanity; that despite its abilities it lacks the sapience to be creative or the ability to move freely. It wants nothing more than to exact revenge on humanity by torturing these last remnants of the species that created it.\n\nThe group reaches the ice caves, where indeed there is a pile of canned goods. The group is overjoyed to find them, but is immediately crestfallen to find that they have no means of opening them. In a final act of desperation, Benny attacks Gorrister and begins to gnaw at the flesh on his face. \n\nTed, in a moment of clarity, realizes their only escape is through death. He seizes a stalactite made of ice and kills Benny and Gorrister. Ellen realizes what Ted is doing, and kills Nimdok, before being killed herself by Ted. Ted runs out of time before he can kill himself, and is stopped by AM. AM, unable to return Ted's four companions to life, focuses all its rage on Ted. To ensure that Ted can never kill himself, AM transforms him into a helpless, gelatinous blob that is incapable of causing itself harm, and constantly alters his perception of time to deepen his anguish. Ted is, however, grateful that he was able to save the others from further torture. Ted's closing thoughts end with the sentence that gives the story its title. \"I have no mouth. And I must scream.\"\n\n\nEllison uses an alternating pair of punchcode tapes as time-breaks—representing AM's \"talkfields\"—throughout the short story. The bars are encoded in International Telegraph Alphabet No 2 (ITA2), a character coding system developed for teletypewriter machines.\n\nThe first talkfield, used four times, translates as \"I THINK, THEREFORE I AM\" and the second one, seen three times, as \"COGITO ERGO SUM\", the same phrase in Latin. The talkfields in many of the early publications were corrupted, up until the preface of the chapter containing \"I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream\" in the first edition of \"The Essential Ellison\" (1991); Ellison states that in that particular edition, \"For the first time anywhere, AM's 'talkfields' appear correctly positioned, not garbled or inverted or mirror-imaged as in \"all\" other versions.\"\n\n\"AM Talkfield #1 - \"I THINK, THEREFORE I AM\"\"\n\nThe first talkfield, as published in the first version of \"The Essential Ellison\", literally translates as\n\ncodice_1\n\nwhere codice_2 is line feed and codice_3 carriage return. codice_4 sets the machine to \"figure\" mode and codice_5 puts it back into \"character\" mode.\n\"AM Talkfield #2 - \"COGITO ERGO SUM\"\"\n\ncodice_6\n\n"}

All fixtures, furniture and artwork were produced by Afghan refugees and Pakistani craftsmen. The haveli was restored by Davis in order to promote cultural understanding in Peshawar of the importance of heritage preservation and the promotion of the arts. Davis spent 13 years in Peshawar (between 1990-2003) promoting and preserving the arts of Afghanistan and Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.\n\nThere are 8 rooms in the hotel, each named after gemstones mined in Afghanistan and Pakistan: lapis lazuli, spinel, morganite, tourmaline, topaz, peridot, ruby, and garnet.

{"id": "1361095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1361095", "title": "Language shift", "text": "Language shift\n\nLanguage shift, also known as language transfer or language replacement or language assimilation, is the process whereby a community of speakers of a language shifts to speaking a completely different language, usually over an extended period of time. Often, languages that are perceived to be higher status stabilise or spread at the expense of other languages that are perceived by their own speakers to be lower-status. An example is the shift from Gaulish to Latin that occurred in what is now France during the time of the Roman Empire.\n\nFor prehistory, Forster et al. (2004) and Forster and Renfrew (2011) observe that there is a correlation of language shift with intrusive male Y chromosomes but not necessarily with intrusive female mtDNA. They conclude that technological innovation (the transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture, or from stone to metal tools) or military prowess (as in the abduction of British women by Vikings to Iceland) causes immigration of at least some males, who are perceived to be of higher status than local males. Then, in mixed-language marriages with these males, prehistoric women prefer to transmit the \"higher-status\" spouse's language to their children, yielding the language/Y-chromosome correlation seen today.\n\nThe process whereby a community of speakers of one language becomes bilingual in another language, and gradually shifts allegiance to the second language is called assimilation. When a linguistic community ceases to use their original language, language death is said to occur.\n\nThe rate of assimilation is the percentage of individuals with a given mother tongue who speak another language more often in the home. The data are used to measure the use of a given language in the lifetime of a person, or most often across generations within a linguistic community.\n\nIn the context of the Indo-European migrations, it has been noted that small groups can change a larger cultural area. Michael Witzel refers to Ehret's model \"which stresses the osmosis, or a \"billiard ball,\" or Mallory's \"Kulturkugel\", effect of cultural transmission.\" According to Ehret, ethnicity and language can shift with relative ease in small societies, due to the cultural, economic and military choices made by the local population in question. The group bringing new traits may initially be small, contributing features that can be fewer in number than those of the already local culture. The emerging combined group may then initiate a recurrent, expansionist process of ethnic and language shift.\n\nDavid Anthony notes that the spread of the Indo-European languages probably did not happen through \"chain-type folk migrations\", but by the introduction of these languages by ritual and political elites, which are emulated by large groups of people. Anthony explains:\nAnthony gives the example of the Luo-speaking Acholi in northern Uganda in the 17th and 18th century, whose language spread rapidly in the 19th century. Anthony notes that \"Indo-European languages probably spread in a similar way among the tribal societies of prehistoric Europe\", carried forward by \"Indo-European chiefs\" and their \"ideology of political clientage\". Anthony notes that \"elite recruitment\" may be a suitable term for this system.\n\nHistorical examples for status shift are the early Welsh and Lutheran Bible translations, leading to the liturgical languages Welsh and Standard German thriving today.\n\nUntil the mid 19th century, southern Carinthia in Austria had an overwhelming Slovene-speaking majority: in the 1820s, around 97% of the inhabitants south of the line Villach-Klagenfurt-Diex spoke Slovene as their native language. In the course of the 19th century, this number dropped significantly. By 1920, already a third of the population of the area had shifted to German as their main language of communication. After the Carinthian Plebiscite in the 1920s, and especially after World War II, most of the population shifted from Slovene to German. In the same region, today only some 13% of the people still speaks Slovene, while more than 85% of the population speaks German. The figures for the whole region are equally telling: in 1818, around 35% of the population of Carinthia spoke Slovene; by 1910, this number dropped to 15.6% and by 2001 to 2.3%. These changes were almost entirely the result of a language shift in the population, with emigration and genocide (by the Nazis during the Second World War) playing only a minor role.\n\nDespite the withdrawal of Belarus from the USSR proclaimed in 1991, use of the Belarusian language is declining. According to a study done by the Belarusian government in 2009, 72% of Belarusians speak Russian at home, and Belarusian is used by only 11.9% of Belarusians. 52.5% of Belarusians can speak and read Belarusian. Only 29.4% can speak, read and write it. According to the research, one out of ten Belarusians does not understand Belarusian.\n\nIn the last two centuries, Brussels transformed from an exclusively Dutch-speaking city to a bilingual city with French as the majority language and lingua franca. The language shift began in the 18th century and accelerated as Belgium became independent and Brussels expanded out past its original city boundaries. From 1880 on, more and more Dutch-speaking people became bilingual, resulting in a rise of monolingual French-speakers after 1910.\n\nHalfway through the 20th century, the number of monolingual French-speakers began to predominate over the (mostly) bilingual Flemish inhabitants. Only since the 1960s, after the establishment of the Belgian language border and the socio-economic development of Flanders took full effect, could Dutch use stem the tide of increasing French use. French remains the city's predominant language and Dutch is spoken by a minority.\n\nThe use of the French language in Canada is complex. In English-speaking regions of Canada, many former Canadian French language minorities have disappeared. Meanwhile, in Quebec, the decline of French has been reversed, and given high rates of emigration and substantial intermarriage with French Canadians, the English language has declined. Quebec's Eastern Townships, once a predominantly English-speaking region, is now overwhelmingly French-speaking. The French-speaking populations of neighboring Ontario and New Brunswick, once on the decline, have also rebounded.\n\nHistorically, an important language shift in China has been the near disappearance of the Manchu language. When China was ruled by the Qing dynasty, whose Emperors were Manchu, Chinese and Manchu had co-official status, and the Emperor heavily subsidized and promoted education in Manchu, but the fact that most of the Manchu Eight Banners lived in garrisons with Mandarin speaking Han Bannermen located across Han Chinese civilian populated cities meant that most Manchus spoke the Beijing dialect of Mandarin by the 19th century and the only Manchu speakers were garrisons left in their homeland of Heilongjiang. Today there are fewer than 100 native speakers of Manchu.\n\nAt the current time, language shift is occurring all across China. Many languages of minority ethnic groups are declining, as well as the many regional varieties of Chinese. Generally the shift is in favour of Standard Chinese (Mandarin), but in the province of Guangdong the cultural influence of nearby Hong Kong has meant local dialects and languages are being abandoned for Cantonese instead and in cities such as Zhongshan, Shunde, Nanhai District, Panyu and Dongguan, younger native residents mostly communicate in Cantonese, instead of their mother-tongue.\n\nIn Egypt, the Coptic language, a descendant of the Afro-Asiatic Egyptian language, was in decline in usage since the time of the Arab conquest in the 7th century. By the 17th century, it was eventually supplanted as a spoken language by Egyptian Arabic. Coptic is today mainly used by the Coptic Church as a liturgical language.\n\nIn Ethiopia, various populations of Nilotic origin have shifted languages over the centuries, adopting the idioms of their Afro-Asiatic-speaking neighbors in the northern areas. Among these groups are the Daasanach or Marille, who today speak the Daasanach language. It belongs to the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family. However, modern genetic analysis of the Daasanach indicates that they are more closely related to Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo-speaking populations inhabiting Tanzania than they are to the Cushitic and Semitic Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations of Ethiopia. This suggests that the Daasanach were originally Nilo-Saharan speakers, sharing common origins with the Pokot. In the 19th century, the Nilotic ancestors of these two populations are believed to have begun separate migrations, with one group heading southwards into the African Great Lakes region and the other group settling in southern Ethiopia. There, the early Daasanach Nilotes would have come into contact with a Cushitic-speaking population, and eventually adopted this group's Afro-Asiatic language.\n\nFinland still has coastal Swedish-speaking enclaves, unlike Estonia where the last coastal Swedes were decimated or escaped to Sweden in 1944. As Finland was under Swedish rule from the medieval ages until 1809, the language of education was Swedish, with Finnish being allowed as a medium of education at the university only in the 19th century, and the first thesis in Finnish being published in 1858. Several of the coastal cities were multilingual; Viipuri had newspapers in Swedish, Finnish, Russian and German. However, the industrialization in the prewar and especially the postwar era and the \"escape from the countryside\" of the 1960s changed the demography of the major cities and led to the Finnish language dominating. While Helsinki was a predominantly Swedish-speaking city in 1910, the Swedish-speaking minority is now 6% of the population.\n\nIn Alsace, France, a longtime Alsatian-speaking region, the native Germanic dialect has been declining after a period of being banned at school by the French government after the First World War and the Second World War. It is being replaced by French.\n\nFrench Flanders, which gradually became part of France between 1659 and 1678, was historically part of the Dutch sprachraum, the native dialect being West Flemish (French Flemish). This is corroborated by the Dutch origin of several town names in the region, such as that of 'Dunkerque' (Dunkirk) which is a French phonetic rendition of the original Dutch name 'Duinkerke' (meaning 'church in the dunes'). The linguistic situation did not change dramatically until the French Revolution in 1789, and Dutch continued to fulfill the main functions of a cultural language throughout the 18th century. During the 19th century, especially in the second half of it, Dutch was banned from all levels of education and lost most of its functions as a cultural language. The larger cities had become predominantly French-speaking by the end of the 19th century.\n\nHowever, in the countryside, many elementary schools continued to teach in Dutch until World War I, and the Roman Catholic Church continued to preach and teach the catechism in Flemish in many parishes. Nonetheless, since French enjoyed a much higher status than Dutch, from about the interbellum onward, everybody became bilingual, the generation born after World War II being raised exclusively in French. In the countryside, the passing on of Flemish stopped during the 1930s or 1940s. Consequently, the vast majority of those still having an active command of Flemish are older than 60. Therefore, complete extinction of French Flemish can be expected in the coming decades.\n\nThe French Basque Country has been subject to intense French-language pressure exerted over the Basque-speaking communities. Basque was both persecuted and excluded from administration and official public use during the takeover of the National Convention (1792-1795), War of the Pyrenees and the Napoleonic period. The compulsory national education system imposed early on a French-only approach (mid-19th century), marginalizing Basque, and by the 1960s family transmission was grinding to a halt in many areas at the feet of the Pyrenees.\n\nBy the 2010s, the receding trend has been somewhat mitigated by the establishment of Basque schooling (the \"ikastolak\") spearheaded by the network Seaska, as well as the influence of the Basque territories from Spain.\n\nAccording to Fañch Broudic, Breton has lost 80% of its speakers in 60 years. Other sources mention that 70% of Breton speakers are over 60. Furthermore, 60% of children received Breton from their parents in the 20s and only 6% in the 80s. Since the 1980s, monolingual speakers are no longer attested.\n\nOn the 27 October 2015, the Senate rejected the draft law on ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages driving away the assumption of Congress for the adoption of the constitutional reform which would have given the value and legitimacy to regional languages such as Breton.\n\nCorsican was long the vernacular language alongside Italian, the official language in Corsica until 1859; afterwards Italian was replaced by French, owing to the acquisition of the island by France from Genoa in 1768. Over the next two centuries, the use of French grew to the extent that, by the Liberation in 1945, all islanders had a working knowledge of French. The 20th century saw a wholesale language shift, with islanders changing their language practices to the extent that there were no monolingual Corsican speakers left by the 1960s. By 1995, an estimated 65 percent of islanders had some degree of proficiency in Corsican, and a small minority, perhaps 10 percent, used Corsican as a first language.\n\nIn Southern Schleswig, an area that belonged to Denmark until the Second Schleswig War 1864, there was from the 17th and up to the 20th centuries a language shift from Danish and North Frisian dialects to Low German and later High German. Historically, most of the region was part of the Danish and North Frisian Language area, adjacent in the South to the German-speaking Holstein. But with the reformation in the 16th century German became church language and in the 19th century also school language in the southern parts of Schleswig. Added to this came the influence of German-speaking Holsatian nobility and merchants. German was (occasionally) also spoken at the royal court in Copenhagen. This political and economic development led gradually to a German language dominating in the southern parts of Schleswig. Native dialects such as the Angel Danish or Eiderstedt Frisian vanished. In the Flensburg area, there arose the mixed language Petuh combining Danish and German elements. So late as in 1851 (in the period of nationalization) the Danish government tried to stop the Language shift, but without success in the long run. After the Second Schleswig War the Prussians introduced a number of language policy measures in the other way to expand the use of (High) German as the language of administration, schooling and church service.\n\nToday, Danish and North Frisian are recognized as minority languages in the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Cantonese became the dominant language spoken in society since widespread immigration to Hong Kong began from the 1940s onward. With immigrants of differing mother tongues, communication was hard without a dominant language. With Cantonese originating from the capital of neighboring Canton province, Cantonese became the dominant language by extension, and other similar dialects started to vanish from use in Hong Kong. Original residents, or aboriginals, of Hong Kong used their own languages including the Tanka, Hakka and Waitau dialect, but with a majority of Hong Kong's population being immigrants by the 1940s and 50s, the dialects vanished at a rapid rate. Most of Hong Kong's younger generation does not understand, let alone speak, their ancestral dialects.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, since Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty, Mandarin Chinese has been more widely implemented in education and many other areas of official society. Though adoption of Mandarin Chinese into society has been rapidly implemented, most Hong Kong residents would not regard it as a first language/dialect. Most Hong Kong residents prefer to communicate in Cantonese in everyday life.\n\nIt is natural that Mandarin Chinese speakers and Cantonese speakers could not mutually understand each other without learning the languages, due to vast difference in pronunciation, intonation, sentence structure and terminology. Furthermore, cultural difference between Hong Kong and China brings upon the variations between the Cantonese used in Hong Kong and that in Canton Province.\n\nCumans seeking refuge from the Turko-Mongols settled in Hungary and were later Magyarized. The Jassic people of Hungary originally spoke the Jassic dialect of Ossetic, but have completely adopted the Hungarian language, forgetting their previous Ossetian language. The territory of today's Hungary was also previously settled by Slavic tribes, which became gradually assimilated to the Hungarian language. Also, language shift may have happened during Hungarian pre-history, as the prehistoric culture of Magyars shows very little similarity to the other Uralic peoples.\n\nThe Italian peninsula and the Po river basin have been a conglomerate of different languages, Latin-derived for the most part. Italy was politically divided up to the late 19th century. Since the Renaissance, a standard for formal, literary and written purposes was developed based on the Tuscan variety. It developed as the language of unified Italy, providing the basis for the Italian language and sidelining other languages of Italy in education and formal settings. These vernaculars have been incorrectly labelled as 'dialects'. Italian expanded as a common linguistic form for everyday use after World War II.\n\nCimbrian, a Germanic language related to Bavarian, was spoken by at least 20,000 people in the 19th Century, with 3,762 people in 1921 and fewer than 300 in 2007. The same scenario goes for Mòcheno.\n\nItalian was made official on the island for the first time in 1760 by decision of the Savoyard government, definitively replacing both Spanish and Sardinian. \nUnder Fascism non-Italian languages were banned, and surnames were changed to sound more Italian. The emphasis on monolingual (Italian-only) policies and assimilation has continued after World War II, with historical sites and ordinary objects renamed in Italian. The Ministry of Public Education reportedly requested the monitoring of Sardinian teachers. The language has been stigmatized as indicative of a lack of education, and as a result it is associated still by many locals with shame, backwardness and provincialism.\n\nDespite campaigns to give Sardinian equal status with Italian as a means to promote cultural identity, a number of factors like immigration from mainland Italy, the interior rural exodus to urban areas and the use of Italian as a prerequisite for jobs and social advancement actually hinder any policy set up to promote the language. For example, despite bilingual-education laws, the use of Sardinian in schools is still discouraged. Therefore, UNESCO classifies Sardinian as \"definitely endangered\", because \"many children learn the language, but some of them cease to use it throughout the school years\".\n\nAt present, language use is far from stable: reports show that, while an estimated 68 percent of the islanders have a good oral command of Sardinian, language ability among the children drops to around 13 percent; some linguists cite the low number of Sardinian-speaking children as indicative of language decline.\nInstead, most of the younger generation, although they do understand some Sardinian, is actually monolingual and speaks a mixture of Italian and Sardinian (considered regional Italian by linguists) that is called \"italiànu porcheddìnu\" (\"piggy Italian\", meaning more or less \"broken Italian\") by native Sardinian speakers. Today, people who speak Sardinian on an everyday basis mainly live in the sparsely populated interior of the island, like the Barbagia region.\n\nAt the present day, the Sardinian-speaking community, despite being the largest minority language group recognised by Italy, is also the least protected one and the language is receding in all domains of use. A solution to the Sardinian question is unlikely to be found any time soon.\n\nOn a survey made by Il Gazzettino, 70% of respondents told they spoke Venetian very or quite often in the family, while 68% with friends. Much smaller share than there used to at work (35%). Compared to 2001, it is the latter sector where the dialect is more in crisis. In fact, if for use within the family networks and friendship, negative signs stop respectively at -4 and -11 percentage points, in the workplace, the balance drops to -22 percentage points. It has to be noted that young people under the age of 25 and students are in the social sectors where the use of dialect falls below the threshold of absolute majority (respectively 43 and 41%), showing a visible generational separation.\n\nBefore the 1930s, Italian was the only official language of Malta, even though it was spoken by only the upper classes, with Maltese being spoken by the lower class. However, English was then added to the mix, and was made a co-official language alongside Maltese, with Italian being dropped as official. The English language has since grown in the country and now threatens the status of Maltese. The number of speakers of Italian there has increased from when the language was official. A trend among the younger generations is to mix English and Italian vocabulary patterns, in making new Maltese words. For example, the Maltese word for library was originally \"bibljoteka\", but this has since been displaced by \"librerija\", formed from the English \"library\", and an Italian pattern ending. In addition to mixing English with Italian, Maltenglish is a commonly occurring amalgam of English and Maltese. This involves using English words in Maltese sentences, or adding English vocabulary into Maltese. Trends show that English is not only becoming the language of choice for more and more people, but is actually transforming the Maltese language itself.\n\nIn the Philippines, Spanish-speaking families have gradually switched over to English since the end of World War II until the former eventually ceased to be a practical everyday language in the country.\n\nAnother example would be the gradual death of the Kinaray-a language of Panay as many native speakers especially in the province of Iloilo are switching to Hiligaynon or mixing the two languages together. Kinaray-a was once spoken in the towns outside the vicinity of Iloílo City, while Hiligaynon was limited to only the eastern coasts and the city proper. However, due to media and other factors such as urbanization, many younger speakers have switched from Kinaray-a to Hiligaynon, especially in the towns of Cabatuan, Santa Barbara, Calinog, Miagao, Passi City, Guimbal, Tigbauan, Tubungan, etc. Many towns, especially Janiuay, Lambunao, and San Joaquin still have a sizeable Kinaray-a-speaking population, with the standard accent being similar to that spoken in the predominantly Karay-a province of Antique. Even in the province of Antique, \"Hiligaynization\" is an issue to be confronted as the province, especially the capital town of San José de Buenavista, undergoes urbanisation. Many investors from Iloílo City bring with them Hiligaynon-speaking workers who are reluctant to learn the local language.\n\nOne of the problems of Kinaray-a is its written form, as its unique \"schwa sound\" is difficult to represent in orthography. As time goes by, Kinaray-a has disappeared in many areas it was once spoken especially in the island of Mindoro and only remnants of the past remain in such towns as Pinamalayan, Bansud, Gloria, Bongabong, Roxas, Mansalay, and Bulalacao in Oriental Mindoro and Sablayan, Calintaan, San Jose, and Magsaysay in Occidental Mindoro, as Tagalog has become the standard and dominantly recognised official language of these areas.\n\nAfter Singapore's independence in 1965, there was a general language shift in the country's interracial lingua franca from Malay to English, as English was chosen as the first language for the country. Among the Chinese community in Singapore, there was a language shift from the various dialects of Chinese to English and Mandarin Chinese. Until the 1980s, Singaporean Hokkien was the lingua franca of Chinese community in Singapore, which has since been replaced with English and Mandarin today. There has been a general language attrition in the use of Chinese other than Mandarin Chinese, especially amongst the younger segments of the Singaporean population.\n\nThe progressive dominion exerted by the Kingdom of Castile over Spain in as much as it gained political power throughout centuries, contributed to the expansion of its language at the expenses of the rest. The accession of the Castilian House of Trastamara to the Crown of Aragon by mid-15th century saw the gradual displacement of the royal languages of the Crown of Aragon, Aragonese and Catalan, despite the prolific Valencian literature in Catalan in this period. Nebrija's \"Gramatica castellana\" (1492), sponsored by the new Spanish monarch Ferdinand II of Aragon, was meant to help expand Castilian, \"the companion of the Empire\". As the Crown of Castile expanded, its different governmental officials at different levels required their subjects to use or understand Castilian and sideline other \"vulgar languages\", or vernaculars. It often meant the use of interpreters in lawsuits, which could tilt the outcome of the case one side or the other, e.g. the Basque witch trials, and the increased use of Castilian in assemblies and decision-making bodies, and documents, despite not being the commonly understood language in a number of areas, like most of the Basque districts (Navarre, Álava, etc.), Catalonia, Galicia, Asturias, parts of Aragon, etc.\n\nAs Aragonese retreated to the sub-Pyrenean valleys, Arabic vanished by the early 17th century, when forced cultural assimilation of the Moriscos was coupled with expulsion (completed in 1614). The arrival of the Bourbons (1700) intensified the centralization of governmental structures and the imposition of Castilian as the only language for official purposes, replacing in 1716 Catalan as the language of Justice Administration in the relevant territories (Nueva Planta Decrees). Unlike Catalan, Basque was never a language written on official documents, but was equally affected. It lost ground to Castilian in all its buffer geographic areas, as well as main institutions as a communication language, after a number of decrees and orders established Castilian as \"the national language of the Empire\" during Charles III's reign; printing in languages other than Spanish was forbidden (1766), and Castilian was the only language taught in school (1768).\n\nThe Peninsular War was followed by the centralization of Spain (Constitutions of 1812, 1837, 1845, 1856, etc.), with only the Basque districts keeping a separate status until 1876. Compulsory education in 1856 made the use of Castilian (Spanish) mandatory, as well as discouraging and forbidding the use of other languages on a number social and institutional settings. Franco and his nationalist dictatorship imposed Spanish as the only valid language for any formal social interaction (1937). By the early 21st century, Spanish was the overwhelmingly dominant language in Spain, with Basque, Catalan, and Galician surviving and developing in their respective regions with different levels of recognition since 1980. Other minorized languages (Asturian, Aragonese) have also seen some recognition in the early 21st century. Catalan, sharing with Basque a strong link between language and identity, enjoys a fairly sound status. Basque competence levels have picked up during the last decades, but everyday use does not go up accordingly. Asturian has been classified by the Endangered Languages Project as being at risk, and Aragonese as an endangered language.\n\nTaiwanese aborigines used only Austronesian languages before other ethnic groups conquered Taiwan. After widespread migration of Han peoples from the 17th to the 19th century, many Taiwanese Plains Aborigines became Sinicized, and shifted their language use to other Sinitic tongues, (mainly Taiwanese Hokkien). Besides, some Hakka people (especially in Yongjing, Changhua, Xiluo, Yunlin, etc.) also shifted from Hakka Chinese to Hokkien (also called Hoklo). They are called \"Hoklo-Hakka\" (Pha̍k-fa-sṳ: \"Ho̍k-ló-hak\", Pe̍h-oē-jī: \"Ho̍k-ló-kheh\", Hanzi: \"\").\n\nWhen Taiwan was under Japanese rule, Japanese became the official language, with the Japanese government promoting Japanese language education. It also led to the creation of Yilan Creole Japanese, a mixture of Japanese, Atayal language, and Hokkien in Yilan County. In World War II, under the Japanification Movement, Chinese was banned in newspapers and school lectures, and the usage of Japanese at home was encouraged, so many urban people turned to using Japanese. In 1941, 57% of Taiwanese could speak Japanese.\n\nAfter the ROC government established rule over Taiwan in 1945, it prohibited the usage of Japanese in newspapers and schools, and promoted the Guoyu movement (Chinese: \"國語運動\") to popularise Standard Mandarin, often through coercive means. In the primary education system, people using local languages would be fined or forced to put on a dialect card. In the mass media, local languages were also discouraged or prohibited, and some books on the romanization of local languages (e.g. Bibles, lyrics books, Pe̍h-oē-jī) were banned. In 1975, The Radio and Television Act (Chinese: \"廣播電視法\") was adopted, restricting the usage of local languages on the radio or TV. In 1985, after the draft of the Language and Script Law (Chinese: \"語文法\") was released by the Ministry of Education, it received considerable opposition because it banned the use of Taiwanese unofficial languages in the public domain. In response, some Hakka groups demonstrated to save their language. After 1987 when martial law was lifted, the Guoyu movement ceased.\n\nThe shift towards monolingual Mandarin was more pronounced amongst Hakka-speaking communities, attributed to Hakka's low social prestige. Prior to the KMT's takeover of the island from the Japanese empire, the Hakka were expected to learn both Hokkien and Japanese. However, the lack of a significant Japanese-speaking base for gaining and then retaining Japanese fluency meant that most Hakka learned only Hokkien. When the KMT fled to Taiwan from mainland China, most mainlanders settled mainly in northern Taiwan, close to Hakka-speaking areas, thus spurring a linguistic shift from Hokkien to Mandarin within the Taipei area. As the bulk of economic activity centered around patronage networks revolving around Mandarin-speaking KMT membership, most of the Hakka became Mandarin monolinguals, due to a shift in social mobility previously centered around Hokkien. Elsewhere, although the percentage of the Hokkien-speaking population declined in relation to its proportion of the population, most Hokkien-speaking households have retained fluency in Hokkien, helped by the liberalization of Taiwanese politics and the end of martial law.\n\nNevertheless, Taiwanese Mandarin has become the most common language in Taiwan today, and the most common home language of Taiwanese youth. In the population census of 2010, Mandarin is the most common home language in the Taipei metropolitan area, Taoyuan, Matsu, aboriginal areas, some Hakka-majority areas, as well as some urban areas of Taichung and Kaohsiung. Conversely, the ability of Taiwanese to speak ethnic languages is strikingly on the decline.\n\nMultiple studies suggested an elite cultural dominance-driven linguistic replacement model to explain the adoption of Turkish language by Anatolian indigenous inhabitants.\n\nGaelic has long suffered from its lack of use in educational and administrative contexts and was long suppressed. The shift from Gaelic to Scots and Scottish English has been ongoing since about 1200 CE; Gaelic has gone from being the dominant language in almost all areas of modern-day Scotland to an endangered language spoken by only about 1% of the population.\n\nWith the advent of devolution, however, Scottish Gaelic has begun to receive greater attention, and it has achieved a degree of official recognition when the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act was enacted by the Scottish Parliament on 21 April 2005. Gaelic medium education in Scotland now enrolls over 2000 pupils a year. Nevertheless, the number of native speakers continues to decline and it is a minority language in most of the traditional Gàidhealtachd, including all census areas outside of the Outer Hebrides.\n\nCockney English, traditionally spoken by working-class Londoners has been predicted to be replaced by Multicultural London English (MLE) or 'Jafaican' within 30 years as Cockneys move out of London. The new language is theorised to have emerged as new migrants spoke their own forms of English such as Nigerian and Indian and contains elements from \"learners’ varieties\" as migrants learn English as a second language.\n\nAlthough English has been the majority language in the United States since independence in 1776, other languages were spoken first in large areas of the country. In addition to hundreds of aboriginal languages, French was once the primary language in Louisiana, Missouri, and areas along the border with Quebec, but the speaking has diminished due to new waves of migration and the rise of English as a lingua franca. Californio Spanish rapidly became a minority language during the mass immigration that took place during the California Gold Rush, and has largely been supplanted by English and Mexican Spanish, surviving mainly as a prestige dialect in Northern and Central California. German was once the primary language in large areas of the Great Plains, but was suppressed due to anti-German sentiment during the First World War.\n\nSince the fall of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, French has declined heavily in Vietnam from being a government language and primary language of education in South Vietnam to being a minority language limited to the elite classes and elderly population. Today, French is spoken fluently by only slightly over 5% of the Vietnamese population. The language shift from French to Vietnamese occurred earlier in the north due to Viet Minh and later communist policies enforcing Vietnamese as the sole language for political and educational purposes. However, since the late 1990s, there has been a minor revival of French in Vietnam.\n\nAmerican linguist Joshua Fishman has proposed a method of reversing language shift which involves assessing the degree to which a particular language is disrupted in order to determine the most effective way of assisting and revitalising the language.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17406217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17406217", "title": "Lexis (Aristotle)", "text": "Lexis (Aristotle)\n\nIn philosophical discourse, lexis (from the Greek: λέξις \"word\") is a complete group of words in a language, vocabulary, the total set of all words in a language, and all words that have meaning or a function in grammar.\n\nAccording to Plato, lexis is the manner of speaking. Plato said that lexis can be divided into mimesis (imitation properly speaking) and diegesis (simple narrative). Gerard Genette states: \"Plato's theoretical division, opposing the two pure and heterogeneous modes of narrative and imitation, within poetic diction, elicits and establishes a practical classification of genres, which includes the two distinct modes...and a mixed mode, for example the Iliad\".\nIn the \"Iliad\", a Greek epic written by Homer, the mixed mode is very prevalent. According to Gerald Prince, diegesis in the \"Iliad\" is the fictional storytelling associated with the fictional world and the enacting/re-telling of the story. Mimesis in the\" Iliad\" is the imitation of everyday, yet fantastical life in the ancient Greek world. Diegesis and mimesis combined represent the fullest extent of lexis; both forms of speech, narrating and re-enacting.\nIn conclusion, lexis is the larger overview of literature. Within lexis the two areas of differentiation of mimesis (imitation) are diegesis (narrative) and the \"direct representation of the actors speaking to the public.\"\n\nAccording to Jose M. Gonzalez, \"Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis.\" Pistis is the Greek word for faith and is one of the rhetorical modes of persuasion.\nGonzalez also points out that, \"By invoking phantasia, lexis against the background Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis.\" Phantasia is a Greek word meaning the process by which all images are presented to us. Aristotle defines phantasia as \"our desire for the mind to mediate anything not actually present to the senses with a mental image.\" Aristotle instructs the reader to use his or her imagination to create the fantastic, unordinary images, all the while using narrative and re-enactment to create a play either written or produced.\n\nAlthough Aristotle at times seems to demean the art of diction or 'voice,' saying that it is not an \"elevated subject of inquiry,\" he does go into quite a bit of detail on its importance and its proper use in rhetorical speech. Often calling it \"style,\" he defines good style as follows: that it must be clear and avoid extremes of baseness and loftiness. Aristotle makes the cases for the importance of diction by saying that, \"it is not enough to know what we ought to say; we must also say it as we ought.\". In an oratorical speech, one must consider not only the facts, but also how to put the facts into words and which words and, also, the \"proper method of delivery.\" Aristotle goes on to say that only the facts in an argument should be important but that since the listeners can be swayed by diction, it must also be considered. \nVoice \n\nAt the time when Aristotle wrote his treatise on Rhetoric, orators had not paid much attention to voice. They thought it was a subject only of concern to actors and poets. In \"The Rhetoric\", Aristotles says, \"proper method of delivery…affects the success of a speech greatly; but hitherto the subject has been neglected.\" Aristotle defined voice as controlling one's voice, using rate, volume and pitch, to convey the appropriate emotions. The manner of voice in which an idea or speech is conveyed affects not only the emotions of the audience but, also, their ability to understand this concept.\nAlthough Aristotle gives this mention and explanation of voice, he does not go into specifics about how to produce appropriate voice or how to convey specific tones with one's voice. This may or may not be due to his mild disdain for the topic as a whole. Modern scholars have explored voice more extensively. According to Taylor Stoehr, \"voice is the pervasive reflection in written or spoken language, of an author's character, the marks by which we recognize his utterance as his.\". However, just as in Aristotle's time set of specific rules or guidelines has yet been laid out for the production or interpretation of voice. Due to the vast array of elements involved in the production of voice this task would be nearly, if not entirely, impossible. \n\nLanguage\n\nAs mentioned before, Aristotle thought the language of a speech should avoid being too lofty or too crude. The speaker must use the ordinary language of everyday life. However, because people best remember what is out of the ordinary, the speaker must use some language that gives the speech an air of importance.\n\nThe elevation of the language must correlate to the elevation of the subject or, in poetry, the character that is speaking. In poetry, language and linguistic devices that convey a sense of importance are more appropriate, and should be used more often because the events of poetry are more removed from ordinary life. They are less appropriate in rhetorical speech because the topics relate more directly to ordinary things and the people who are listening to the speech. Most of all, the speaker must \"give the impression of speaking naturally and not artificially.\" When one seems to speak with ease, the audience is more easily persuaded that the facts he is communicating are truthful. \n\nAlso, a speaker must avoid using very many \"strange words, compound words, and invented words.\". Aristotle considered this kind of language an excessive departure from the way people normally speak. However, one acceptable departure from plain language is the use of metaphor because metaphors are used by all people in everyday conversation.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, lexis, meaning the delivery of words, is the least important area of speech when in comparison to invention, arrangement and style. However, lexis is still closely looked at and broken down into two forms. The two types of lexis in rhetoric include: \"lexis graphike\" and \"lexis agonistike\" The separate terms that describe the two forms of lexis, graphike and agonistike, have been conformed by several Latin terms. Although the words directly relate to the type of lexis, the theories of Aristotle and Plato do not compare.\n\n\"Lexis graphike\" comes from the term \"zographia\", meaning realistic painting, and graphe, meaning writing. Plato believes that writing and painting are one of the same. His theory proves that both do not have the capability to defend themselves through an argument, question and answer, which conveys that these forms can not prove truth. Although for Aristotle, \"lexis graphik\"e is the most accurate delivery of language, which leads to his theory that proves that writing does not need to be questioned because it is already exact. \"Lexis agonistike\" however is from the term \"skiagraphia\", meaning a rough sketch or outline of painting. Aristotle once again opposes Plato by believing that \"lexis agonistike\" does not need questions asked, but only answers. The answer refers to the use of invention given to the actor because the writing portion is only outlined.\n\nTo further understand the separate types of lexis, each type can be broken down by how the writing is prepared and delivered. \"Lexis graphike\" is the most precise style of rhetoric and strongly appeals to intelligence. The delivery of \"lexis graphike\" is designed for a careful reading from either the book or paper as opposed to a performance that leaves room for improvisation. This type of lexis is a simple, straight forward recitation rather than an elaborate presentation. \"Lexis graphike\" is most accurately written and depends the least upon the person who is delivering the speech. \"Lexis agonistike\" contradicts \"lexis graphike\" because it is typically carelessly written and meant for a full performance. The lack of attention given to the written words allows the performer to improvise. This gives the presentation a style that reflects the entertainer rather the writer.\n"}

{"id": "16872485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16872485", "title": "Nonformal learning", "text": "Nonformal learning\n\nNon-formal learning includes various structured learning situations which do not either have the level of curriculum, syllabus, accreditation and certification associated with 'formal learning', but have more structure than that associated with 'informal learning', which typically take place naturally and spontaneously as part of other activities. These form the three styles of learning recognised and supported by the OECD.\n\nExamples of non-formal learning include swimming sessions for toddlers, community-based sports programs, and programs developed by organisations such as the Boy Scouts, the Girl Guides, community or non-credit adult education courses, sports or fitness programs, professional conference style seminars, and continuing professional development. The learner’s objectives may be to increase skills and knowledge, as well as to experience the emotional rewards associated with increased love for a subject or increased passion for learning.\n\nThe debate over the relative value of formal and informal learning has existed for a number of years. Traditionally formal learning takes place in a school or university and has a greater value placed upon it than informal learning, such as learning within the workplace. This concept of formal learning being the socio-cultural accepted norm for learning was first challenged by Scribner and Cole in 1973, who claimed most things in life are better learnt through informal processes, citing language learning as an example. Moreover, anthropologists noted that complex learning still takes place within indigenous communities that had no formal educational institutions.\n\nIt’s the acquisition of this knowledge or learning which occurs in everyday life that has not been fully valued or understood. This led to the declaration by the OECD educational ministers of the \"life-long learning for all\" strategy in 1996. This includes 23 countries from five continents, who have sought to clarify and validate all forms of learning including formal, non-formal and informal. This has been in conjunction with the European Union which has also developed policies for life-long learning which focus strongly on the need to identify, assess and certify non-formal and informal learning, particularly in the workplace.\n\n\n\nAlthough all definitions can be contested (see below) this article shall refer to the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) 2001 communication on 'lifelong learning: formal, non-formal and informal learning' as the guideline for the differing definitions.\n\nFormal learning: learning typically provided by an education or training institution, structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support) and leading to certification. Formal learning is intentional from the learner’s perspective. (Cedefop 2001)\n\nInformal learning: learning resulting from daily life activities related to work, family or leisure. It is not structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support) and typically does not lead to certification. Informal learning may be intentional but in most cases it is not-intentional (or \"incidental\"/random). (Cedefop 2001)\n\nNon-formal learning: see definition above.\n\nIf there is no clear distinction between formal and in-formal learning where is the room for non-formal learning. It is a contested issue with numerous definitions given. The following are some the competing theories.\n\n\"It is difficult to make a clear distinction between formal and informal learning as there is often a crossover between the two.\" (McGivney, 1999, p1).\n\nSimilarly, Hodkinson et al. (2003), conclude after a significant literature analysis on the topics of formal, informal, and non-formal learning, that \"the terms informal and non-formal appeared interchangeable, each being primarily defined in opposition to the dominant formal education system, and the largely individualist and acquisitional conceptualisations of learning developed in relation to such educational contexts.\" (Hodkinson et al., 2003, p. 314) Moreover, he states that \"It is important not to see informal and formal attributes as somehow separate, waiting to be integrated. This is the dominant view in the literature, and it is mistaken. Thus, the challenge is not to, somehow, combine informal and formal learning, for informal and formal attributes are present and inter-related, whether we will it so or not. The challenge is to recognise and identify them, and understand the implications. For this reason, the concept of non-formal learning, at least when seen as a middle state between formal and informal, is redundant.\" (p. 314)\n\n\"Eraut's classification of learning into formal and non-formal\":\n\nThis removes informal learning from the equation and states all learning outside of formal learning is non-formal. Eraut equates informal with connotations of dress, language or behaviour that have no relation to learning. Eraut defines formal learning as taking place within a learning framework; within a classroom or learning institution, with a designated teacher or trainer; the award of a qualification or credit; the external specification of outcomes. Any learning that occurs outside of these parameters is non-formal. (Ined 2002)\n\n\"The EC (2001) Communication on Lifelong Learning: formal, non-formal and informal learning\":\n\nThe EU places non-formal learning in between formal and informal learning (see above). This has learning both in a formal setting with a learning framework and as an organised event but within a qualification. \"Non-formal learning: learning that is not provided by an education or training institution and typically does not lead to certification. It is, however, structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support). Non-formal learning is intentional from the learner’s perspective.\" (Cedefop 2001)\n\n\"Livingstone's adults formal and informal education, non-formal and informal learning\":\n\nThis focuses on the idea of adult non-formal education. This new mode, ‘informal education’ is when teachers or mentors guide learners without reference to structured learning outcomes. This informal education learning is gaining knowledge without an imposed framework, such as learning new job skills. (Infed, 2002)\n\n\"Billett (2001): there is no such thing as informal learning\":\n\nBillet's definition states there is no such thing as non-formal and informal learning. He states all human activity is learning, and that everything people do involves a process of learning. \"all learning takes place within social organisations or communities that have formalised structures.\" Moreover, he states most learning in life takes place outside of formal education.(Ined 2002)\n\nRecently, many international organizations and UNESCO Member States have emphasized the importance of learning that takes place outside of formal learning settings. This emphasis has led UNESCO, through its Institute of Lifelong Learning (UIL), to adopt international guidelines for the Recognition, Validation and Accreditation of the Outcomes of Non-formal and Informal Learning in 2012. The emphasis has also led to an increasing number of policies and programmes in many Member States, and a gradual shift from pilots to large-scale systems such as those in Portugal, France, Australia, Mauritius and South Africa.\n\nCedefop has created European guidelines to provide validation to a broad range of learning experiences, thereby aiding transparency and comparability across its national borders. The broad framework for achieving this certification across both non-formal and informal learning is outlined in the Cedefop European guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning; Routes from learning to certification.\n\nThere are different approaches to validation between OCED and EU countries, with countries adopting different measures. The EU, as noted above, through the Cedefop-released European guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning in 2009 to standardise validation throughout the EU. Within the OCED countries, the picture is more mixed.\n\nCountries with the existence of recognition for non-formal and informal learning (Feutrie, 2007)\n\nNon-formal education (NFE) is popular on a worldwide scale in both 'western' and 'developing countries'. Non-formal education can form a matrix with formal and non-formal education, as non-formal education can mean any form of systematic learning conducted outside the formal setting. Many courses in relation to non-formal education have been introduced in several universities in western and developing countries.\n\nThe UNESCO institute of education conducted a seminar on non-formal education in Morocco. The association for development of education in Africa (ADEA) launched many programmes in non-formal education in at least 15 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2001 World Bank conducted an international seminar on basic education in non-formal programmes. In addition to this the World Bank was advised to extend its services to adult and non-formal education.\n\nA report on vocational education, Making Learning Visible: the identification, assessment and recognition of non-formal learning in Europe, defines non-formal learning as semi structured, consisting of planned and explicit approaches to learning introduced into work organisations and elsewhere, not recognised within the formal education and training system.\n\nCommunity work, which is particularly widespread in Scotland, fosters people's commitment to their neighbours and encourages participation in and development of local democratic forms of organisation.\n\nYouth work which focuses on making people more active in the society.\n\nSocial work which helps young people in homes to develop ways to deal with complex situations like fostering fruitful relationships between parents and children, bringing different groups of career together, etc...\n\nIn France and Italy animation in a particular form is a kind of non-formal education. It uses theatre and acting as means of self-expression with different community groups for children and people with special needs. This type of non-formal education helps in ensuring active participation and teaches people to manage the community in which they live.\n\nYouth and community organisations young people have the opportunity to discover, analyse and understand values and their implications and build a set of values to guide their lives. They run work camps and meetings, recruit volunteers, administer bank acoounts, give counselling etc. to work toward social change.\n\nEducation plays an important role in development. Out of school programmes are important to provide adaptable learning opportunities and new skills and knowledge to a large percentage of people who are beyond the reach of formal education. Non-formal education began to gain popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Today, non-formal education is seen as a concept of recurrent and lifelong learning.\n\nNon-formal education is popular among the adults specially the women as it increases women's participation in both private and public activities, i.e. in house hold decision making and as active citizens in the community affairs and national development. These literacy programmes have a dramatic impact on women's self-esteem because they unleash their potential in economic, social, cultural and political spheres.\n\nAccording to UNESCO (2010), non-formal education helps to ensures equal access to education, eradicate illiteracy among women and improve women's access to vocational training, science, technology and continuing education. It also encourages the development of non-discriminatory education and training. The effectiveness of such literacy and non-formal education programmes are bolstered by family, community and parental involvement.\n\nNon-formal education is beneficial in a number of ways. There are activities that encourage young people to choose their own programme and projects that are important because they offer the youth the flexibility and freedom to explore their emerging interests. When the youth can choose the activities in which they can participate, they have opportunities to develop several skills like decision making skills.\n\nNon-formal learning has experiential learning activities that foster the development of skills and knowledge. This helps in building the confidence and abilities among the youth of today. It also helps in development of personal relationships not only among the youth but also among the adults. It helps in developing interpersonal skills among the young people as they learn to interact with peers outside the class and with adults in the community.\n\nThere are drawbacks to non-formal education which include that non-formal learning is not based on curriculum but based on experience. There is low efficiency in non-formal education.\n\nFormal education system are inadequate to effectively meet the needs of the individual and the society. The need to offer more and better education at all levels, to a growing number of people, particularly in developing countries, the scant success of current formal education systems to meet all such demands, has shown the need to develop alternatives to learning.\n\nThe rigid structure of formal schools, mainly because of rules and regulations than concentrating on the real need of the students, offering curriculum that leans away from the individual and from society, far more concerned with performing programmes than reaching useful objectives. This called for non-formal education which starting from the basic need of the students, is concerned with the establishment of strategies that are compatible with reality.\n\n"}
{"id": "81724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=81724", "title": "Oral tradition", "text": "Oral tradition\n\nOral tradition, or oral lore, is a form of human communication wherein knowledge, art, ideas and cultural material is received, preserved and transmitted orally from one generation to another. The transmission is through speech or song and may include folktales, ballads, chants, prose or verses. In this way, it is possible for a society to transmit oral history, oral literature, oral law and other knowledge across generations without a writing system, or in parallel to a writing system. Religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, for example, have used an oral tradition, in parallel to a writing system, to transmit their canonical scriptures, secular knowledge such as Sushruta Samhita, hymns and mythologies from one generation to the next.\n\nOral tradition is information, memories and knowledge held in common by a group of people, over many generations, and it is not same as testimony or oral history. In a general sense, \"oral tradition\" refers to the recall and transmission of a specific, preserved textual and cultural knowledge through vocal utterance. As an academic discipline, it refers both to a set of objects of study and a method by which they are studied.\n\nThe study of oral tradition is distinct from the academic discipline of oral history, which is the recording of personal memories and histories of those who experienced historical eras or events. Oral tradition is also distinct from the study of orality defined as thought and its verbal expression in societies where the technologies of literacy (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population. A folklore is a type of oral tradition, but knowledge other than folklore has been orally transmitted and thus preserved in human history.\n\nAccording to John Foley, oral tradition has been an ancient human tradition found in \"all corners of the world\". Modern archaeology has been unveiling evidence of the human efforts to preserve and transmit arts and knowledge that depended completely or partially on an oral tradition, across various cultures:\n\nIn Asia, the transmission of folklore, mythologies as well as scriptures in ancient India, in different Indian religions, was by oral tradition, preserved with precision with the help of elaborate mnemonic techniques. Some scholars such as Jack Goody state that the Vedas are not the product strictly of an oral tradition, basing this view by comparing inconsistencies in the transmitted versions of literature from various oral societies such as the Greek, Serbia and other cultures, then noting that the Vedic literature is too consistent and vast to have been composed and transmitted orally across generations, without being written down. According to Goody, the Vedic texts likely involved both a written and oral tradition, calling it a \"parallel products of a literate society\".\n\nIn ancient Greece, the oral tradition was a dominant tradition. Homer's epic poetry, states Michael Gagarin, was largely composed, performed and transmitted orally. As folklores and legends were performed in front of distant audiences, the singers would substitute the names in the stories with local characters or rulers to give the stories a local flavor and thus connect with the audience, but making the historicity embedded in the oral tradition as unreliable. The lack of surviving texts about the Greek and Roman religious traditions have led scholars to presume that these were ritualistic and transmitted as oral traditions, but some scholars disagree that the complex rituals in the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations were an exclusive product of an oral tradition. The Torah and other ancient Jewish literature, the Judeo-Christian Bible and texts of early centuries of Christianity are rooted in an oral tradition, and the term \"People of the Book\" is a medieval construct. This is evidenced, for example, by the multiple scriptural statements by Paul admitting \"previously remembered tradition which he received\" orally.\n\nOral traditions face the challenge of accurate transmission and verifiability of the accurate version, particularly when the culture lacks written language or has limited access to writing tools. Oral cultures have employed various strategies that achieve this without writing. For example, a heavily rhythmic speech filled with mnemonic devices enhances memory and recall. A few useful mnemonic devices include alliteration, repetition, assonance, and proverbial sayings. In addition, the verse is often metrically composed with an exact number of syllables or morae - such as with Greek and Latin prosody and in Chandas found in Hindu and Buddhist texts. The verses of the epic or text are typically designed wherein the long and short syllables are repeated by certain rules, so that if an error or inadvertent change is made, an internal examination of the verse reveals the problem. Such strategies help facilitate transmission of information from individual to individual without a written intermediate, and they can also be applied to oral governance.\n\nRudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book provides an excellent demonstration of oral governance in the Law of the Jungle. Not only does grounding rules in oral proverbs allow for simple transmission and understanding, but it also legitimizes new rulings by allowing extrapolation. These stories, traditions, and proverbs are not static, but are often altered upon each transmission barring the overall meaning remains intact. In this way, the rules that govern the people are modified by the whole and not authored by a single entity.\n\nAncient texts of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism were preserved and transmitted by an oral tradition. For example, the śrutis of Hinduism called the Vedas, the oldest of which trace back to the second millennium BCE. Michael Witzel explains this oral tradition as follows:\n\nAncient Indians developed techniques for listening, memorization and recitation of their knowledge, in schools called Gurukul, while maintaining exceptional accuracy of their knowledge across the generations. Many forms of recitation or \"paths\" were designed to aid accuracy in recitation and the transmission of the \"Vedas\" and other knowledge texts from one generation to the next. All hymns in each Veda were recited in this way; for example, all 1,028 hymns with 10,600 verses of the Rigveda was preserved in this way; as were all other Vedas including the Principal Upanishads, as well as the Vedangas. Each text was recited in a number of ways, to ensure that the different methods of recitation acted as a cross check on the other. Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat summarizes this as follows:\n\nThese extraordinary retention techniques guaranteed an accurate Śruti, fixed across the generations, not just in terms of unaltered word order but also in terms of sound. That these methods have been effective, is testified to by the preservation of the most ancient Indian religious text, the \"\" (ca. 1500 BCE).\n\nThe following overview draws upon \"Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography\", (NY: Garland Publishing, 1985, 1986, 1989); additional material is summarized from the overlapping prefaces to the following volumes: \"The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology\", (Indiana University Press, 1988, 1992); \"Immanent Art: From Structure to Meaning in Traditional Oral Epic\" (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991); \"The Singer of Tales in Performance\" (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1995) and \"Comparative Research on Oral Traditions: A Memorial for Milman Parry\" (Columbus, Ohio: Slavica Publishers, 1987). in the work of the Serb scholar Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787–1864), a contemporary and friend of the Brothers Grimm. Vuk pursued similar projects of \"salvage folklore\" (similar to rescue archaeology) in the cognate traditions of the Southern Slavic regions which would later be gathered into Yugoslavia, and with the same admixture of romantic and nationalistic interests (he considered all those speaking the Eastern Herzegovinian dialect as Serbs). Somewhat later, but as part of the same scholarly enterprise of nationalist studies in folklore, the turcologist Vasily Radlov (1837–1918) would study the songs of the Kara-Kirghiz in what would later become the Soviet Union; Karadzic and Radloff would provide models for the work of Parry.\n\nIn a separate development, the media theorist Marshall McLuhan (1911–1980) would begin to focus attention on the ways that communicative media shape the nature of the content conveyed. He would serve as mentor to the Jesuit, Walter Ong (1912–2003), whose interests in cultural history, psychology and rhetoric would result in \"Orality and Literacy\" (Methuen, 1980) and the important but less-known \"Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality and Consciousness\" (Cornell, 1981) These two works articulated the contrasts between cultures defined by primary orality, writing, print, and the secondary orality of the electronic age.\n\nOng's works also made possible an integrated theory of oral tradition which accounted for both production of content (the chief concern of Parry-Lord theory) and its reception. This approach, like McLuhan's, kept the field open not just to the study of aesthetic culture but to the way physical and behavioral artifacts of oral societies are used to store, manage and transmit knowledge, so that oral tradition provides methods for investigation of cultural differences, other than the purely verbal, between oral and literate societies.\n\nThe most-often studied section of \"Orality and Literacy\" concerns the \"psychodynamics of orality\" This chapter seeks to define the fundamental characteristics of 'primary' orality and summarizes a series of descriptors (including but not limited to verbal aspects of culture) which might be used to index the relative orality or literacy of a given text or society.\n\nIn advance of Ong's synthesis, John Miles Foley began a series of papers based on his own fieldwork on South Slavic oral genres, emphasizing the dynamics of performers and audiences. Foley effectively consolidated oral tradition as an academic field when he compiled \"Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research\" in 1985. The bibliography gives a summary of the progress scholars made in evaluating the oral tradition up to that point, and includes a list of all relevant scholarly articles relating to the theory of Oral-Formulaic Composition. He also both established both the journal \"Oral Tradition\" and founded the \"Center for Studies in Oral Tradition\" (1986) at the University of Missouri. Foley developed Oral Theory beyond the somewhat mechanistic notions presented in earlier versions of Oral-Formulaic Theory, by extending Ong's interest in cultural features of oral societies beyond the verbal, by drawing attention to the agency of the bard and by describing how oral traditions bear meaning.\n\nThe bibliography would establish a clear underlying methodology which accounted for the findings of scholars working in the separate Linguistics fields (primarily Ancient Greek, Anglo-Saxon and Serbo-Croatian). Perhaps more importantly, it would stimulate conversation among these specialties, so that a network of independent but allied investigations and investigators could be established.\n\nFoley's key works include \"The Theory of Oral Composition\" (1988); \"Immanent Art\" (1991); \"Traditional Oral Epic: The Odyssey, Beowulf and the Serbo-Croatian Return-Song\" (1993); \"The Singer of Tales in Performance\" (1995); \"Teaching Oral Traditions\" (1998); \"How to Read an Oral Poem\" (2002). His Pathways Project (2005-2012) draws parallels between the media dynamics of oral traditions and the Internet.\n\nThe theory of oral tradition would undergo elaboration and development as it grew in acceptance. While the number of formulas documented for various traditions proliferated, the concept of the formula remained lexically-bound. However, numerous innovations appeared, such as the \"formulaic system\" with structural \"substitution slots\" for syntactic, morphological and narrative necessity (as well as for artistic invention). Sophisticated models such as Foley's \"word-type placement rules\" followed. Higher levels of formulaic composition were defined over the years, such as \"ring composition\", \"responsion\" and the \"type-scene\" (also called a \"theme\" or \"typical scene\"). Examples include the \"Beasts of Battle\" and the \"Cliffs of Death\". Some of these characteristic patterns of narrative details, (like \"the arming sequence;\" \"the hero on the beach\"; \"the traveler recognizes his goal\") would show evidence of global distribution.\n\nAt the same time, the fairly rigid division between oral and literate was replaced by recognition of transitional and compartmentalized texts and societies, including models of diglossia (Brian Stock Franz Bäuml, and Eric Havelock). Perhaps most importantly, the terms and concepts of \"orality\" and \"literacy\" came to be replaced with the more useful and apt \"traditionality\" and \"textuality\". Very large units would be defined (The Indo-European Return Song) and areas outside of military epic would come under investigation: women's song, riddles and other genres.\n\nThe methodology of oral tradition now conditions a large variety of studies, not only in folklore, literature and literacy, but in philosophy, communication theory, Semiotics, and including a very broad and continually expanding variety of languages and ethnic groups, and perhaps most conspicuously in biblical studies, in which Werner Kelber has been especially prominent. The annual bibliography is indexed by 100 areas, most of which are ethnolinguistic divisions.\n\nPresent developments explore the implications of the theory for rhetoric and composition, interpersonal communication, cross-cultural communication, postcolonial studies, rural community development, popular culture and film studies, and many other areas. The most significant areas of theoretical development at present may be the construction of systematic hermeneutics and aesthetics specific to oral traditions.\n\nThe theory of oral tradition encountered early resistance from scholars who perceived it as potentially supporting either one side or another in the controversy between what were known as \"unitarians\" and \"analysts\" – that is, scholars who believed Homer to have been a single, historical figure, and those who saw him as a conceptual \"author function,\" a convenient name to assign to what was essentially a repertoire of traditional narrative. A much more general dismissal of the theory and its implications simply described it as \"unprovable\" Some scholars, mainly outside the field of oral tradition, represent (either dismissively or with approval) this body of theoretical work as reducing the great epics to children's party games like \"telephone\" or \"Chinese whispers\". While games provide amusement by showing how messages distort content via uncontextualized transmission, Parry's supporters argue that the theory of oral tradition reveals how oral methods optimized the signal-to-noise ratio and thus improved the quality, stability and integrity of content transmission.\n\nThere were disputes concerning particular findings of the theory. For example, those trying to support or refute Crowne's hypothesis found the \"Hero on the Beach\" formula in numerous Old English poems. Similarly, it was also discovered in other works of Germanic origin, Middle English poetry, and even an Icelandic prose saga. J.A. Dane, in an article characterized as \"polemics without rigor\" claimed that the appearance of the theme in Ancient Greek poetry, a tradition without known connection to the Germanic, invalidated the notion of \"an autonomous theme in the baggage of an oral poet.\"\n\nWithin Homeric studies specifically, Lord's \"The Singer of Tales\", which focused on problems and questions that arise in conjunction with applying oral-formulaic theory to problematic texts such as the \"Iliad\", \"Odyssey\", and even \"Beowulf\", influenced nearly all of the articles written on Homer and oral-formulaic composition thereafter. However, in response to Lord, Geoffrey Kirk published \"The Songs of Homer\", questioning Lord's extension of the oral-formulaic nature of Serbian and Croatian literature (the area from which the theory was first developed) to Homeric epic. Kirk argues that Homeric poems differ from those traditions in their \"metrical strictness\", \"formular system[s]\", and creativity. In other words, Kirk argued that Homeric poems were recited under a system that gave the reciter much more freedom to choose words and passages to get to the same end than the Serbo-Croatian poet, who was merely \"reproductive\". Shortly thereafter, Eric Havelock's \"Preface to Plato\" revolutionized how scholars looked at Homeric epic by arguing not only that it was the product of an oral tradition, but also that the oral-formulas contained therein served as a way for ancient Greeks to preserve cultural knowledge across many different generations. Adam Parry, in his 1966 work \"Have we Homer's \"Iliad\"?\", theorized the existence of the most fully developed oral poet to his time, a person who could (at his discretion) creatively and intellectually create nuanced characters in the context of the accepted, traditional story. In fact, he discounted the Serbo-Croatian tradition to an \"unfortunate\" extent, choosing to elevate the Greek model of oral-tradition above all others. Lord reacted to Kirk's and Parry's essays with \"Homer as Oral Poet\", published in 1968, which reaffirmed Lord's belief in the relevance of Yugoslav poetry and its similarities to Homer and downplayed the intellectual and literary role of the reciters of Homeric epic.\n\nMany of the criticisms of the theory have been absorbed into the evolving field as useful refinements and modifications. For example, in what Foley called a \"pivotal\" contribution, Larry Benson introduced the concept of \"written-formulaic\" to describe the status of some Anglo-Saxon poetry which, while demonstrably written, contains evidence of oral influences, including heavy reliance on formulas and themes A number of individual scholars in many areas continue to have misgivings about the applicability of the theory or the aptness of the South Slavic comparison, and particularly what they regard as its implications for the creativity which may legitimately be attributed to the individual artist. However, at present, there seems to be little systematic or theoretically coordinated challenge to the fundamental tenets of the theory; as Foley put it, \"\"there have been numerous suggestions for revisions or modifications of the theory, but the majority of controversies have generated further understanding.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the few prehistoric cave painting sites in France that remain open to the general public. Extending for over a kilometre and a half from the entrance are caverns, the walls of which are painted with dramatic murals dating from the Gravettian culture (some 25,000 years BC). Some of the paintings and engravings, however, may date from the later Magdalenian era (16,000 years BC).\n\nThis area once had a great river flowing through it, cutting underground channels which were later used by humans for shelter and eventually for mural painting.\n\nThe cave art located in the deeper areas of the cave was discovered in 1922 by Marthe David, her brother Andre David and Henri Dutetre, three teenagers who had been exploring the cave for two years. Like other children of the area, these three had been encouraged and assisted in their exploration by Father Amedee Lemozi, the curate of Cabrerets and an amateur archaeologist who had discovered other cave paintings in the region.\n\nThe walls of seven of the chambers at Pech Merle have fresh, lifelike images of woolly mammoth, spotted horses, single colour horses, bovids, reindeer, handprints, and some humans. Footprints of children, preserved in what was once clay, have been found more than half a mile underground. In 2013 the Tracking in Caves-project tested experience based reading of prehistoric footprints by specialised trackers of Ju/'hoansi San with great success. Within a six-mile radius of the site are ten other caves with prehistoric art of the Upper Palaeolithic period, but none of these are open to the public. During the Ice Age the caves were very probably used as places of refuge by prehistoric peoples when the area had an Arctic climate, very cold temperatures, and native animal species very different from those of the present day. It is supposed that, at some point in the past, rain and sliding earth covered the cave entrances with an airtight seal until the 20th century.\n\nExperimental reconstruction work by French archaeologist Michel Lorblanchet has suggested that the application of the paint for some of the paintings was probably by means of a delicate spitting technique.\nThe cave at Pech Merle has been open to the public since 1926. Visiting groups are limited in size and number so as not to destroy the delicate artwork with the excessive humidity, heat and carbon dioxide produced by breathing.\n\n"}
{"id": "1604015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1604015", "title": "Phonemic awareness", "text": "Phonemic awareness\n\nPhonemic awareness is a subset of phonological awareness in which listeners are able to hear, identify and manipulate phonemes, the smallest mental units of sound that helps to differentiate units of meaning (morphemes). Separating the spoken word \"cat\" into three distinct phonemes, , , and , requires phonemic awareness. However, phonemes could not be separated like notes in a song or could be identified in isolation.\nThe National Reading Panel has found that phonemic awareness improves children's word reading and reading comprehension, as well as helping children learn to spell. Phonemic awareness is the basis for learning phonics.\n\nPhonemic awareness and phonological awareness are often confused since they are interdependent. Phonemic awareness is the ability to hear and manipulate individual phonemes. Phonological awareness includes this ability, but it also includes the ability to hear and manipulate larger units of sound, such as onsets and rimes and syllables.\n\nStudies by Vickie Snider have shown that phonemic awareness has a direct correlation with students' ability to read as they get older. Phonemic awareness builds a foundation for students to understand the rules of the English language. This in turn allows each student to apply these skills and increase his or her oral reading fluency and understanding of the text.\n\nA research study done by Robert Johnson and Gregory Tweedie applying direct Phonemic Awareness (PA) instruction to young English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners in rural Malaysia showed that those children educated by PA achieved significantly greater test scores than the control group. PA accelerated the acquisition of relevant literacy and numeracy skills in this case. It also suggested that PA might help close the literacy and numeracy education gap between urban pre-school attender and rural non attender children. However, this enhancement needs to be validated by further research. Later, another study with the same PA instruction approach was conducted on Arabic adult English Language Learners (ELL) in a Nursing English for Academic Proposes program showed the same positive result. Despite the substantial gains in vowel recognition, a downside of using PA, not in this study, is that adult ELLs may negatively perceive PA as a \"childish\" approach. \n\nPhonemic awareness relates to the ability to distinguish and manipulate individual sounds, such as , , and in the case of \"foot\". The following are common phonemic awareness skills practiced with students:\nThere are other phonemic awareness activities, such as sound substitution, where students are instructed to replace one sound with another; sound addition, where students add sounds to words; and sound switching, where students manipulate the order of the phonemes. These are more complex but research supports the use of the three listed above, particularly oral segmenting and oral blending.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5956143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5956143", "title": "Portal (video game)", "text": "Portal (video game)\n\nPortal is a puzzle-platform video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. It was released in a bundle package called \"The Orange Box\" for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2007. The game has since been ported to other systems, including OS X, Linux, and Android.\n\n\"Portal\" consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using \"the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The player-character, Chell, is challenged and taunted by an artificial intelligence named GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed. The game's unique physics allows kinetic energy to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of portals to maneuver through the test chambers. This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game \"Narbacular Drop\"; many of the team members from the DigiPen Institute of Technology who worked on \"Narbacular Drop\" were hired by Valve for the creation of \"Portal\", making it a spiritual successor to the game.\n\n\"Portal\" was acclaimed as one of the most original games of 2007, despite criticisms of its short duration and limited story. The game received praise for its originality, unique gameplay and dark story with a humorous series of dialogue. GLaDOS, voiced by Ellen McLain in the English-language version, received acclaim for her unique characterization, and the end credits song \"Still Alive\", written by Jonathan Coulton for the game, was acclaimed for its original composition and humorous twist. Excluding Steam download sales, over four million copies of the game have been sold since its release, spawning official merchandise from Valve including plush Companion Cubes, as well as fan recreations of the cake and portal gun, a standalone version, titled \"\", on the Xbox Live Arcade service in October 2008, which added an additional 14 puzzles to the gameplay, and a sequel, \"Portal 2\", which was released in 2011, adding several new gameplay mechanics and a cooperative multiplayer mode.\n\nIn \"Portal\", the player controls the protagonist, Chell, from a first-person perspective as she is challenged to navigate through a series of rooms using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or portal gun, under the watchful supervision of the artificial intelligence GLaDOS. The portal gun can create two distinct portal ends, orange and blue. The portals create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in three-dimensional space. Neither end is specifically an entrance or exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. An important aspect of the game's physics is momentum redirection. As moving objects pass through portals, they come through the exit portal at the same direction that the exit portal is facing and with the same speed with which they passed through the entrance portal. For example, a common maneuver is to jump down to a portal on the floor and emerge through a wall, flying over a gap or another obstacle. This allows the player to launch objects or Chell over great distances, both vertically and horizontally, referred to as 'flinging' by Valve. As GLaDOS puts it, \"In layman's terms: speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.\" If portal ends are not on parallel planes, the character passing through is reoriented to be upright with respect to gravity after leaving a portal end.\n\nChell and all other objects in the game that can fit into the portal ends will pass through the portal. However, a portal shot cannot pass through an open portal; it will simply deactivate or create a new portal in an offset position. Creating a portal end instantly deactivates an existing portal end of the same color. Moving objects, glass, special wall surfaces, liquids, or areas that are too small will not be able to anchor portals. Chell is sometimes provided with cubes that she can pick up and use to climb on or to hold down large buttons that open doors or activate mechanisms. Particle fields known as emancipation grills, occasionally called \"fizzlers\" in the developer commentary, exist at the end of all and within some test chambers; when passed through, they will deactivate any active portals and disintegrate any object carried through. The fields also block attempts to fire portals through them.\n\nAlthough Chell is equipped with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling, she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects falling through portals, and by a series of crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.\n\nGameSpot noted, in its initial review of \"Portal\", that many solutions exist for completing each puzzle, and that the gameplay \"gets even crazier, and the diagrams shown in the trailer showed some incredibly crazy things that you can attempt\". Two additional modes are unlocked upon the completion of the game that challenge the player to work out alternative methods of solving each test chamber. Challenge maps are unlocked near the halfway point and Advanced Chambers are unlocked when the game is completed. In Challenge mode, levels are revisited with the added goal of completing the test chamber either with as little time, with the least number of portals, or with the fewest footsteps possible. In Advanced mode, certain levels are made more complex with the addition of more obstacles and hazards.\n\nThe game features two characters: the player-controlled silent protagonist named Chell, and GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System), a computer artificial intelligence that monitors and directs the player. In the English-language version, GLaDOS is voiced by Ellen McLain, though her voice has been altered to sound more artificial. The only background information presented about Chell is given by GLaDOS; the credibility of these facts, such as Chell being adopted, an orphan, and having no friends, is questionable at best, as GLaDOS is a liar by her own admission. In the \"Lab Rat\" comic created by Valve to bridge the gap between \"Portal\" and \"Portal 2\", Chell's records reveal she was ultimately rejected as a test subject for having \"too much tenacity\"—the main reason Doug Rattman, a former employee of Aperture Science, moved Chell to the top of the test queue.\n\n\"Portal\" takes place in the Aperture Science Laboratories Computer-Aided Enrichment Center—Aperture Science for short—which is a research facility responsible for the creation of the portal gun. According to information presented in \"Portal 2\", the location of the complex is in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Aperture Science exists in the same universe as the Half-Life (series), although connections between the two franchises are limited to references.\n\nInformation about the company, developed by Valve for creating the setting of the game, is revealed during the game and via the real-world promotional website. According to the Aperture Science website, Cave Johnson founded the company in 1943 for the sole purpose of making shower curtains for the U.S. military. However, after becoming mentally unstable from \"moon rock poisoning\" in 1978, Johnson created a three-tier research and development plan to make his organization successful. The first two tiers, the Counter-Heimlich Maneuver (a maneuver designed to ensure choking) and the Take-A-Wish Foundation (a program to give the wishes of terminally ill children to adults in need of dreams), were commercial failures and led to an investigation of the company by the U.S. Senate. However, when the investigative committee heard of the success of the third tier—a person-sized, ad-hoc quantum tunnel through physical space, with a possible application as a shower curtain—it recessed permanently and gave Aperture Science an open-ended contract to continue its research. The development of GLaDOS, an artificially intelligent research assistant and disk-operating system, began in 1986 in response to Black Mesa's work on similar portal technology. A presentation seen during gameplay reveals that GLaDOS was also included in a proposed bid for de-icing fuel lines, incorporated as a fully functional disk-operation system that is arguably alive, unlike Black Mesa's proposal, which inhibits ice, nothing more. Roughly thirteen years later, work on GLaDOS was completed and the untested AI was activated during the company's first ever bring-your-daughter-to-work day in May 2000. Immediately after activation, the facility was flooded with deadly neurotoxin by the AI. Events of the first \"Half-Life\" game occur shortly thereafter, presumably leaving the facility forgotten by the outside world due to apocalyptic happenings. Wolpaw, in describing the ending of \"Portal 2\", affirmed that the Combine invasion, chronologically taking place after \"Half-Life\" and before \"Half-Life 2\", had occurred before \"Portal 2\"s events.\n\nThe areas of the Enrichment Center that Chell explores suggest that it is part of a massive research installation. At the time of events depicted in \"Portal\", the facility seems to be long-deserted, although most of its equipment remains operational without human control. During its development, \"\" featured a chapter set on Aperture Science's icebreaker ship \"Borealis\", but this was abandoned and removed before release.\n\n\"Portal\"s plot is revealed to the player via audio messages or \"announcements\" from GLaDOS and visual elements inside rooms found in later levels. According to \"The Final Hours of Portal 2\", the year is established to be \"somewhere in 2010\"—twelve years after Aperture Science's abandonment.\n\nThe game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence, about the upcoming test experience. Chell then enters into distinct test chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person. Chell is promised cake and grief counseling as her reward if she manages to complete all the test chambers.\n\nChell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives turn more sinister than her helpful demeanor suggests; although she is designed to appear helpful and encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, and GLaDOS even directs Chell through a live-fire course designed for military androids as a result of \"mandatory scheduled maintenance\" in the regular test chamber, as well as having some test chambers flooded with a bio-hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS boasts about the fidelity and importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart centered on each face, for helping Chell to complete the chamber. However, GLaDOS then declares that it \"unfortunately must be euthanized\" in an \"emergency intelligence incinerator\" before Chell can continue. Some of the later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled, such as \"I don't blame you\" and \"No hard feelings\".\n\nAfter Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS congratulates her and prepares her \"victory candescence\", maneuvering Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. As GLaDOS assures her that \"all Aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4,000 degrees Kelvin (3,727 °C, or 6,740 °F)\", Chell escapes with the use of the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center. GLaDOS becomes panicked and insists that she was only pretending to kill Chell, as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the \"party escort submission position\", lying face-first on the ground, so that a \"party associate\" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues anyway. Throughout this section, GLaDOS still sends messages to Chell and it becomes clear that she became corrupt and had killed everyone else in the center, which is also revealed in a later comic. Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem \"The Chariot\", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and Emily Brontë's \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.\n\nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements claiming that she is going the wrong way as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Eventually, Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to plead with and threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" which the Aperture Science employees allegedly installed after GLaDOS flooded the enrichment center with a deadly neurotoxin gas, and goes on to state that now there is nothing to prevent her from doing so once again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS attempts to discourage her both verbally, with a series of taunts and increasingly juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell has destroyed the final personality core, a portal malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. One of the final scenes is changed through a patch of the PC version that was made available a few days before \"Portal 2\"s announcement; in this retroactive continuity, Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the \"party escort submission position\", revealing the entity to be a \"party associate\".\n\nThe final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a Black Forest cake, and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. One by one a number of the cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, causing the room to blackout. As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song \"Still Alive\", which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive, that her \"happy\" core wasn't disabled.\n\n\"Portal\" is Valve's spiritual successor to the freeware game \"Narbacular Drop\", the 2005 independent game released by students of the DigiPen Institute of Technology; the original \"Narbacular Drop\" team was subsequently hired by Valve. Valve became interested in \"Narbacular Drop\" after seeing the game at DigiPen's annual career fair; Robin Walker, one of Valve's developers, saw the game at the fair and later contacted the team providing them with advice and offering to show their game at Valve's offices. After their presentation, Valve's president Gabe Newell quickly offered the entire team jobs at Valve to develop the game further. Newell later commented that he was impressed with the DigiPen team as \"they had actually carried the concept through\", already having included the interaction between portals and physics, completing most of the work that Valve would have had to commit on their own. Certain elements have been retained from \"Narbacular Drop\", such as the system of identifying the two unique portal endpoints with the colors orange and blue. A key difference in the signature portal mechanic between the two games however is that \"Portal\"s portal gun cannot create a portal through an existing portal unlike in \"Narbacular Drop\". The game's original setting, of a princess trying to escape a dungeon, was dropped in favor of the Aperture Science approach. \"Portal\" took approximately two years and four months to complete after the DigiPen team was brought into Valve, and no more than ten people were involved with its development. \"Portal\" writer Erik Wolpaw, who, along with fellow writer Chet Faliszek, was hired by Valve for the game, claimed that \"Without the constraints, \"Portal\" would not be as good a game\".\n\nFor the first year of development the team focused mostly on the gameplay without any narrative structure. Playtesters found the game to be fun but asked about what these test chambers were leading towards. This prompted to team to come up with a narrative for \"Portal\". The \"Portal\" team worked with \"Half-Life\" series writer Marc Laidlaw on fitting the game into the series' plot. This was done, in part, due to the limited art capabilities of the small team; instead of creating new assets for \"Portal\", they decided to tie the game to an existing franchise—\"Half-Life\"—to allow them to reuse the \"Half-Life 2\" art assets. Wolpaw and Faliszek were put to work on the dialogue for \"Portal\". The concept of a computer AI guiding the player through experimental facilities to test the portal gun was arrived at early in the writing process. They drafted early lines for the yet-named \"polite\" AI with humorous situations, such as requesting the player's character to \"assume the party escort submission position\", and found this style of approach to be well-suited to the game they wanted to create, ultimately leading to the creation of the GLaDOS character. GLaDOS was central to the plot, as Wolpaw notes \"We designed the game to have a very clear beginning, middle, and end, and we wanted GLaDOS to go through a personality shift at each of these points.\" Wolpaw further describes the idea of using cake as the reward came about as \"at the beginning of the \"Portal\" development process, we sat down as a group to decide what philosopher or school of philosophy our game would be based on. That was followed by about 15 minutes of silence and then someone mentioned that a lot of people like cake.\" The cake element along with additional messages given to the player in the behind-the-scenes areas were written and drawn by Kim Swift.\n\nThe austere settings in the game came about because testers spent too much time trying to complete the puzzles using decorative but non-functional elements. As a result, the setting was minimized to make the usable aspects of the puzzle easier to spot, using the clinical feel of the setting in the film \"The Island\" as reference. While there were plans for a third area, an office space, to be included after the test chambers and the maintenance areas, the team ran out of time to include it. They also dropped the introduction of the Rat Man, a character who left the messages in the maintenance areas, to avoid creating too much narrative for the game, though the character was developed further in a tie-in comic \"Lab Rat\", that ties \"Portal\" and \"Portal 2\"s story together. According to project lead Kim Swift, the final battle with GLaDOS went through many iterations, including having the player chased by James Bond lasers, which was partially applied to the turrets, Portal Kombat where the player would have needed to redirect rockets while avoiding turret fire, and a chase sequence following a fleeing GLaDOS. Eventually, they found that playtesters enjoyed a rather simple puzzle with a countdown timer near the end; Swift noted, \"Time pressure makes people think something is a lot more complicated than it really is\", and Wolpaw admitted, \"It was really cheap to make [the neurotoxin gas]\" in order to simplify the dialogue during the battle.\n\nChell's face and body are modeled after Alésia Glidewell, an American freelance actress and voice-over artist, selected by Valve from a local modeling agency for her face and body structure. Ellen McLain provided the voice of the antagonist GLaDOS. Erik Wolpaw noted, \"When we were still fishing around for the turret voice, Ellen did a sultry version. It didn't work for the turrets, but we liked it a lot, and so a slightly modified version of that became the model for GLaDOS's final incarnation.\" Mike Patton performed the growling and snarling voice of GLaDOS's final personality core, named the Anger Sphere.\n\nThe Weighted Companion Cube inspiration was from project lead Kim Swift with additional input from Wolpaw from reading some \"declassified government interrogation thing\" whereby \"isolation leads subjects to begin to attach to inanimate objects\"; Swift commented, \"We had a long level called Box Marathon; we wanted players to bring this box with them from the beginning to the end. But people would forget about the box, so we added dialogue, applied the heart to the cube, and continued to up the ante until people became attached to the box. Later on, we added the incineration idea. The artistic expression grew from the gameplay.\" Wolpaw further noted that the need to incinerate the Weighted Companion Cube came as a result of the final boss battle design; they recognized they had not introduced the idea of incineration necessary to complete the boss battle, and by training the player to do it with the Weighted Companion Cube, found the narrative \"way stronger\" with its \"death\". Swift noted that any similarities to psychological situations in the Milgram experiment or \"\" are happenstance.\n\nThe portal gun's full name, Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, can be abbreviated as ASHPD, which resembles a shortening of the name Adrian Shephard, the protagonist of \"\". This similarity was noticed by fans before the game's release; as a result, the team placed a red herring in the game by having the letters of Adrian Shephard highlighted on keyboards found within the game. According to Kim Swift, the cake is a Black Forest cake that she thought looked the best at the nearby Regent Bakery and Café in Redmond, Washington, and, as an Easter egg within the game, its recipe is scattered among various screens showing lines of binary code. The Regent Bakery has stated that since the release of the game, its Black Forest cake has been one of its more popular items.\n\nMost of the game's soundtrack is non-lyrical ambient music composed by Kelly Bailey and Mike Morasky, somewhat dark and mysterious to match the mood of the environments. The closing credits song, \"Still Alive\", was written by Jonathan Coulton and sung by Ellen McLain (a classically trained operatic soprano) as the GLaDOS character. A brief instrumental version of \"Still Alive\" is played in an uptempo Latin style over radios in-game. Wolpaw notes that Coulton was invited to Valve a year before the release of \"Portal\", though it was not yet clear where Coulton would contribute. \"Once Kim [Swift] and I met with him, it quickly became apparent that he had the perfect sensibility to write a song for GLaDOS.\" The use of the song over the closing credits was based on a similar concept from the game \"God Hand\", one of Wolpaw's favorite titles. The song was released as a free downloadable song for the music video game \"Rock Band\" on April 1, 2008. The soundtrack for \"Portal\" was released as a part of \"The Orange Box Original Soundtrack\" and includes both GLaDOS's in-game rendition and Coulton's vocal mix of \"Still Alive\".\n\n\"Portal\"s soundtrack was released as part of a four-disc retail release, \"Portal 2: Songs To Test By (Collector's Edition)\", on October 30, 2012, featuring music from both games. The game's soundtrack became available via Steam Music on September 24, 2014.\n\nIn January 2008, Valve released a special demo version titled \"Portal: The First Slice\", free for any Steam user using Nvidia graphics hardware as part of a collaboration between the two companies. It also comes packaged with \"\", \"Peggle Extreme\", and \"\". The demo includes test chambers 00 to 10 (eleven in total). Valve has since made the demo available to all Steam users.\n\n\"Portal\" was first released as part of \"The Orange Box\" for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on October 10, 2007, and for the PlayStation 3 on December 11, 2007. The Windows version of the game is also available for download separately through Valve's content delivery system, Steam, and was released as a standalone retail product on April 9, 2008. In addition to \"Portal\", the \"Box\" also included \"Half-Life 2\" and its two add-on episodes, as well as \"Team Fortress 2\". \"Portal\"s inclusion within the \"Box\" was considered an experiment by Valve; having no idea of the success of \"Portal\", the \"Box\" provided it a \"safety net\" via means of these other games. \"Portal\" was kept to a modest length in case the game did not go over well with players. Since then, a standalone version of the game was released for Microsoft Windows users.\n\n\"Portal\" was the first Valve-developed game to be added to the OS X-compatible list of games available on the launch of the Steam client for Mac on May 12, 2010, supporting Steam Play, in which players that had bought the game either on a Macintosh or Windows computer could also play it on the alternate system. As part of the promotion, \"Portal\" was offered as a free title for any Steam user during the two weeks following the Mac client's launch. Within the first week of this offer, over 1.5 million copies of the game were downloaded through Steam. A similar promotion was held in September 2011, near the start of a traditional school year, encouraging the use of the game as an educational tool for science and mathematics. Valve wrote that they felt that \"Portal\" \"makes physics, math, logic, spatial reasoning, probability, and problem-solving interesting, cool, and fun\", a necessary feature to draw children into learning. This was tied to Digital Promise, a United States Department of Education initiative to help develop new digital tools for education, and which Valve is part of.\n\n\"Portal: Still Alive\" was announced as an exclusive Xbox Live Arcade game at the 2008 E3 convention, and was released on October 22, 2008. It features the original game, 14 new challenges, and new achievements. The additional content was based on levels from the map pack \"Portal: The Flash Version\" created by We Create Stuff and contains no additional story-related levels. According to Valve spokesman Doug Lombardi, Microsoft had previously rejected \"Portal\" on the platform due to its large size. \"Portal: Still Alive\" was well received by reviewers. 1UP.com's Andrew Hayward stated that, with the easier access and lower cost than paying for \"The Orange Box\", \"Portal\" is now \"stronger than ever\". IGN editor Cam Shea ranked it fifth on his top 10 list of Xbox Live Arcade games. He stated that it was debatable whether an owner of \"The Orange Box\" should purchase this, as its added levels do not add to the plot. However, he praised the quality of the new maps included in the game. The game ranked 7th in a later list of top Xbox Box Live titles compiled by IGN's staff in September 2010.\n\nDuring 2014 GPU Technology Conference on March 25, 2014, Nvidia announced that they are porting \"Portal\" to their Android handheld, the Nvidia Shield. The version was released on May 12, 2014.\n\n\"Portal\" received critical acclaim, often earning more praise than either \"Half-Life 2: Episode Two\" or \"Team Fortress 2\", two titles also included in \"The Orange Box\". It was praised for its unique gameplay and dark, deadpan humor. Eurogamer cited that \"the way the game progresses from being a simple set of perfunctory tasks to a full-on part of the \"Half-Life\" story is absolute genius\", while GameSpy noted, \"What \"Portal\" lacks in length, it more than makes up for in exhilaration.\" The game was criticized for sparse environments, and both criticized and praised for its short length. Aggregate reviews for the stand-alone PC version of \"Portal\" gave the game a 90/100 through 28 reviews on Metacritic. In 2011, Valve stated that \"Portal\" had sold more than four million copies through the retail versions, including the standalone game and \"The Orange Box\", and from the Xbox Live Arcade version.\n\nThe game generated a fan following for the Weighted Companion Cube—even though the cube itself does not talk or act in the game. Fans have created plush and papercraft versions of the cube and the various turrets, as well as PC case mods and models of the Portal cake and portal gun. Jeep Barnett, a programmer for \"Portal\", noted that players have told Valve that they had found it more emotional to incinerate the Weighted Companion Cube than to harm one of the \"Little Sisters\" from \"BioShock\". Both GLaDOS and the Weighted Companion Cube were nominated for the Best New Character Award on G4, with GLaDOS winning the award for \"having lines that will be quoted by gamers for years to come.\"\n\nBen Croshaw of \"Zero Punctuation\" gave the game the only entirely positive review in the show's history, calling it \"the most fun you'll have with your PC until they invent a force-feedback codpiece\". Croshaw went on to say: \"I went in expecting a slew of interesting portal-based puzzles and that's exactly what I got, but what I wasn't expecting was some of the funniest pitch black humor I've ever heard in a game\". He states that, while the game was short, the two- to three-hour length of the game was perfect as the game did not outstay its welcome, and called the ending \"balls-tighteningly fantastic\", while praising the game as \"absolutely sublime from start to finish\" (adding that he would jam forks in his eyes if he ever praised a game so highly ever again).\n\nWriting for GameSetWatch in 2009, columnist Daniel Johnson pointed out similarities between \"Portal\" and Erving Goffman's essay on dramaturgy, \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\", which equates one's persona to the front and back stage areas of a theater. The game was also made part of the required course material among other classical and contemporary works, including Goffman's work, for a freshman course \"devoted to engaging students with fundamental questions of humanity from multiple perspectives and fostering a sense of community\" for Wabash College in 2010. \"Portal\" has also been cited as a strong example of instructional scaffolding that can be adapted for more academic learning situations, as the player, through careful design of levels by Valve, is first hand-held in solving simple puzzles with many hints at the correct solution, but this support is slowly removed as the player progresses in the game, and completely removed when the player reaches the second half of the game. Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Hamish Todd considered \"Portal\" as an exemplary means of game design by demonstrating a series of chambers after the player has obtained the portal gun that gently introduce the concept of flinging without any explicit instructions. \"Portal\" was exhibited at the Smithsonian Art Exhibition in America from February 14 through September 30, 2012. \"Portal\" won the \"Action\" section for the platform \"Modern Windows\".\n\n\"Portal\" won several awards:\n\nThe popularity of the game and of its characters led Valve to develop merchandise for \"Portal\" made available through its online Valve physical merchandise store. Some of the more popular items were the Weighted Companion Cube plush toys and fuzzy dice. When first released, both were sold out in under 24 hours. Other products available through the Valve store include T-shirts and Aperture Science coffee mugs and parking stickers, and merchandise relating to the phrase \"the cake is a lie\", which has become an internet meme. Wolpaw noted they did not expect certain elements of the game to be as popular as they were, while other elements they had expected to become fads were ignored, such as a giant hoop that rolls on-screen during the final scene of the game that the team had named Hoopy.\n\nA modding community has developed around \"Portal\", with users creating their own test chambers and other in-game modifications. The group \"We Create Stuff\" created an Adobe Flash version of \"Portal\", titled \"Portal: The Flash Version\", just prior to release of \"The Orange Box\". This flash version was well received by the community and the group have since converted it to a map pack for the published game. Another mod, \"Portal: Prelude\", is an unofficial prequel developed by an independent team of three that focuses on the pre-GLaDOS era of Aperture Science, and contains nineteen additional \"crafty and challenging\" test chambers. An ASCII version of \"Portal\" was created by Joe Larson. An unofficial port of \"Portal\" to the iPhone using the Unity game engine was created but only consisted of a single room from the game. \"Mari0\" is a fan-made four-player coop mashup of the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" and \"Portal\".\n\nSwift stated that future \"Portal\" developments would depend on the community's reactions, saying, \"We're still playing it by ear at this point, figuring out if we want to do multiplayer next, or \"Portal 2\", or release map packs.\" Some rumors regarding a sequel arose due to casting calls for voice actors. On March 10, 2010, \"Portal 2\" was officially announced for a release late in that year; the announcement was preceded by an alternate reality game based on unexpected patches made to \"Portal\" that contained cryptic messages in relation to \"Portal 2\"s announcement, including an update to the game, creating a different ending for the fate of Chell. The original game left her in a deserted car park after destroying GLaDOS, but the update involved Chell being dragged back into the facility by a \"Party Escort Bot\". Though \"Portal 2\" was originally announced for a Q4 2010 release, the game was released on April 19, 2011.\n\n"}
{"id": "3613832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3613832", "title": "Post-romanticism", "text": "Post-romanticism\n\nPost-romanticism or Postromanticism refers to a range of cultural endeavors and attitudes emerging in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, after the period of Romanticism.\n\nHerman Melville and Thomas Carlyle are post-Romantic writers. Flaubert's \"Madame Bovary\" is a post-Romantic novel. The period of post-romanticism in poetry is defined as the late nineteenth century, but includes the poetry of Letitia Elizabeth Landon and Tennyson.\n\nPost-romanticism in music referred to Romantic composers who would use forms that were found typically in the Classical and Baroque while still retaining aspects of the Romantic era. Among the most well known post-Romantic composers are Giacomo Puccini and Sergei Rachmaninov. Arthur Berger describes the mysticism of La Jeune France as post-Romanticism rather than neo-Romanticism. Hans Pfitzner also wrote post-Romantic works such as his opera \"Palestrina\".\n\nQuite unlike Late Romantic composers such as Richard Strauss and Alexander Scriabin, the composers of the Post-Romantic created music that would use either or both traditional form and harmony. Béla Bartók, for example, \"in such Strauss-influenced works as \"Duke Bluebeard's Castle\",\" may be described as having still used \"dissonance ['such intervals as fourths and sevenths'] for purposes of post-Romantic expression, not simply [always] as an appeal to the primal art of sound\"—unlike Arnold Schoenberg and Strauss himself, who both believed in \"a mythology of historical progress in Western music\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "158945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158945", "title": "Preprint", "text": "Preprint\n\nIn academic publishing, a preprint is a version of a scholarly or scientific paper that precedes formal peer review and publication in a peer-reviewed scholarly or scientific journal. The preprint may be available, often as a non-typeset version available free, before and/or after a paper is published in a journal.\n\nPublication of manuscripts in a peer-reviewed journal often takes weeks, months or even years from the time of initial submission, owing to the time required by editors and reviewers to evaluate and critique manuscripts, and the time required by authors to address critiques. The need to quickly circulate current results within a scholarly community has led researchers to distribute documents known as preprints, which are manuscripts that have yet to undergo peer review. They may be considered as grey literature. The immediate distribution of preprints allows authors to receive early feedback from their peers, which may be helpful in revising and preparing articles for submission.\n\nSince 1991, preprints have increasingly been distributed electronically on the Internet, rather than as paper copies. This has given rise to massive preprint databases such as arXiv.org and to institutional repositories.\n\nIn some journals, posting preprints may disqualify the research from submission for publication due to the Ingelfinger Rule. The majority of publishers however do allow work to be published to preprint servers before submission while others do not and are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn 2016, several new preprint servers were proposed by Crossref, Centre for Open Science and ASAPbio.\n\nIn January 2017, the Medical Research Council announced that they will now be actively supporting preprints with effect from April 2017. Also in January 2017, Wellcome Trust stated that they will now accept preprints in grant applications. In February 2017, a coalition of scientists and biomedical funding bodies including the National Institutes of Health, the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust launched a proposal for a central site for life-sciences preprints. In February 2017, SciELO announced plans to set up a preprints server – SciELO Preprints. In March 2017, the National Institutes for Health issued a new policy encouraging research preprint submissions. In April 2017, Center for Open Science announced that it will be launching six new preprint archives.\n\nWhile a preprint is an article that has not yet undergone peer review, a postprint is an article which has been peer reviewed in preparation for publication in a journal. Both the preprint and postprint may differ from the final published version of an article. Preprints and postprints together are referred to as e-prints or eprints.\n\nThe word reprint refers to hard copies of papers that have already been published; reprints can be produced by the journal publisher, but can also be generated from digital versions (for example, from an electronic database of peer-reviewed journals), or from eprints self-archived by their authors in their institutional repositories.\n\nIn academia, preprints are not likely to be weighed heavily when a scholar is evaluated for tenure or promotion, unless the preprint becomes the basis for a peer-reviewed publication.\n\nAuthorea was launched in 2012 as a collaborative writing platform used by researchers to write, cite, collaborate, host and post their articles. The site is the only preprint server that displays manuscripts as HTML with interactive figures and hosted data.\n\n\"PeerJ PrePrints\" is a free preprint server operated by \"PeerJ\". Articles submitted undergo a basic screening process but are not peer-reviewed. Commenting is allowed by any registered user, and download and pageview data are supplied. All articles are published with a CC-BY license. As of September 2016, 2,439 articles have been made available. Zenodo is a repository for research data that has been used also as preprint repository, because it offers document preview and a DOI number for the submitted document. MDPI launched an additional preprint server in 2016.\n\nThere are two servers for LIS and allied fields: Eprints in Library and Information Science (e-LIS) and the LIS Scholarship Archive (LISSA). e-LIS was launched in 2003, and is an international open access repository for academic papers in Library and Information Science (LIS), run by volunteers. LISSA was launched in 2017 as an open access repository for all materials created by those in LIS and allied fields, including work that happens outside the traditional realms of academia, such as oral histories, community works, code, data, and manuscripts. It is run by members of the library and archives community, and their technology partner, the Center for Open Science, using the Open Science Framework to host materials.\n\nThe e-print archive arXiv (pronounced \"archive\") is one of the best-known preprint servers. It was created by Paul Ginsparg in 1991 at Los Alamos National Laboratory for the purpose of distributing theoretical high-energy physics preprints. In 2001, arXiv.org moved to Cornell University and now encompasses the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics. Within the field of high-energy physics, the posting of preprints on arXiv is so common that many peer-reviewed journals allow submission of papers from arXiv directly, using the arXiv e-print number.\n\nIn some branches of physics, the arXiv database may serve as a focal point for the many criticisms made of the peer review process and peer-reviewed journals. In his column in \"Physics Today\", April 1992, David Mermin described Ginsparg's creation as potentially \"string theory's greatest contribution to science\". About 8,000 preprints per month are uploaded to arXiv as of 2016.\n\nAn engineering preprint server, engrXiv, was launched in 2016 by the Center for Open Science and administrated by the University of Wisconsin–Stout. Whilst under development, it used a temporary email deposit system. As of April 2017, the official home for engrXiv went live after the web interface was launched in December 2016.\n\nThe server viXra was established in 2009 for authors who are excluded from arXiv.org and other repositories due to submission filtering.\n\nThe ability to distribute manuscripts as preprints has had a great impact on computer science, particularly in the way that scientific research is disseminated in that field (see CiteSeer). The open access movement has tended to focus on distributed institutional collections of research, global harvesting, and aggregation through search engines and gateways such as OAIster, rather than a global discipline base such as arXiv. \"E-prints\" can now refer to any electronic form of a scholarly or scientific publication, including journal articles, conference papers, research theses or dissertations, because these usually are found in multidisciplinary collections, called open access repositories, or eprints archives.\n\nThe biological sciences have lagged behind the physical sciences in their use of preprints. Based on the success of arXiv, bioRxiv was introduced in 2013, operated by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Therapoid Preprint was launched in 2017 by Open Therapeutics, and ChemRxiv was announced in 2016 hosted by the American Chemical Society. In 2017, it was confirmed that ChemRxiv will be powered by figshare. Articles undergo basic screening for offensive and/or non-scientific content but do not undergo a peer review process.\n\nBetween 2007–2012 Nature Publishing Group ran their own preprint server, \"Nature Precedings.\" It hosted manuscripts, posters, and unpublished observations.\n\nASAPbio (Accelerating Science and Publication in biology) is \"a scientist-driven initiative to promote innovation and transparency in life sciences communication\" through the use of preprints.\n\nOne of the earlier preprint servers is PhilSci-Archive, launched in 2001 for all subfields of Philosophy of Science, hosted by the University Library System at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nAn open archive of the social sciences. SocArXiv was formed in July 2016 by a group of sociologists, members of the academic library community, and their technology partner, the Center for Open Science, using the Open Science Framework. It is administratively housed at the University of Maryland and directed by Philip Cohen. SocArXiv officially launched in December 2016. Frequently asked questions about SocArXiv.\n\nPsyArXiv is a similar preprint service for the psychological sciences which launched in 2016 by the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science and the Center for Open Science.\n\nThe Social Science Research Network is a repository for both working papers and accepted papers, which shows download and citation data within the site for each stored paper. In May 2016, SSRN was acquired by Elsevier.\n\nUnder construction at the end of 2016 is an Agriculture preprint repository AgriXiv which will be launched with support from Open Science Framework. AgrXiv was pre-launched in early February 2017 on a staging server on GitHub and then formally launched later on 14th February 2017 by the Open Access India, community of practice advocating Open Access in India.\n\nUnder construction in December 2016 and due to launch in early 2017 is PaleorXiv which will be launched with support from Open Science Framework. As of May 2017, PaleorXiv is now open for submissions. The first submissions appeared online in August 2017.\n\nUnder construction in April 2017 is SportRxiv, a preprint archiving service for the sport, exercise, and rehabilitation sciences which was launched in August 2017 with support from Open Science Framework.\n\nThe service LawArXiv 'Legal Scholarship in the Open' was announced in May 2017.\n\nLaunched in August 2017 is Thesis Commons, a preprint service for free open publication of student theses and dissertations supported by Open Science Framework.\n\nJMIR Preprints is a preprint server that evolved from JMIR Publications' experiments in open peer-review. It contains primarily submitted manuscripts which are currently under open peer-review.\n\nMedArXiv is a preprint service for the medicine and health sciences which is under development with support from Open Science Framework.

Following the premiere of the HGTV’s ‘\"Flip or Flop\"’ in 2013, the show’s hosts, Tarek and Christina El-Moussa, launched Real Estate Elevated.\n\nTarek and Christina El-Moussa became involved in the real estate flipping business shortly after the 2008 recession. They downsized their lifestyle so that they could begin investing in this new venture and they honed their skills over the years that followed.\n\nWhen they were approached by HGTV in 2013, house flipping was not yet mainstream. The show is now on its sixth season and the couple shares their knowledge and unique strategies through their Real Estate Elevated seminars that are held all over the United States. The Real Estate Elevated program was created to give individuals the tools necessary to start their own real estate flipping businesses. Aspiring investors are invited to attend a free seminar before deciding on an education plan that suits their individual goals.\n\nTarek and Christina El Moussa, like many in the U.S., suffered a significant financial crisis back in 2008. Their income dried up, and they were forced to downsize their home, their car, and their job. They struggled to regain the financial freedom they had previously enjoyed for a few years. Then they discovered house flipping. They flipped their first property in 2010, and never looked back.\n\nBy 2012, they had been signed by HGTV to film a new reality show: \"Flip or Flop\". The added publicity shed light on their growing expertise, and they started sharing their hard-won industry knowledge with other real estate investors. Their desire to share their method with those who want to achieve the same financial security as they did led to the founding of Real Estate Elevated—an education system that teaches would-be flippers how to be successful.\nSince then, Tarek and Christina have trained thousands of real estate experts, many of whom now train others in the Real Estate Elevated program.\n\nIn the last few decades, flipping houses has become a popular way to earn money, both as supplemental income, and as a primary occupation. Unlike many sources of income, however, there’s significant risk involved in the process. An inexperienced flipper stands to suffer significant losses on their investment if they make the wrong mistakes—a fact that can frequently serve as a barrier to entry for those wanting to join the industry.\n\nReal Estate Elevated helps new and less experienced flippers to minimize the risk involved by closing the knowledge gap. Real estate industry experts teach methods and tactics pioneered and refined by Tarek and Christina El Moussa, sharing their secrets for success to up-and-coming entrepreneurs.\n\nThe training is provided in several different formats. It starts with a free two-and-a-half hour renovation training event that discusses the basics. The next step is a three day “Real Estate Accelerator Workshop” that goes into deeper detail on Real Estate Elevated’s methodologies. Beyond these primary trainings, they offer ongoing mentoring and coaching, including large events and one-on-one trainings.\nThe trainings focus on critical parts of the flipping process, including how to find properties, how to get financing, how to create cash flow, and how to do wholesale deals.\n\nAfter the Houston flooding in 2016, Real Estate Elevated donated $150,000 to Habitat for Humanity, an organization that helps people in need buy or repair homes. So far, the money has helped rebuild three homes that were damaged during the storm in the Houston, Texas area.\n\n"}

Members of the initial cast include: Boris Kodjoe, Nelly, Duane Martin, J.B. Smoove, Nick Cannon, Oliver (Hart's assistant, played by James Davis), and Robin Thicke, who did not return for the second season due to his music career, though Hart has stated that the door is open for Thicke to return.\n\nThe series is intentionally filmed in a style similar to Bravo's \"The Real Housewives\". Episodes often hinge on the \"real\" Kevin Hart's desperately unsuccessful attempts to climb Hollywood's celebrity social ladder (which always backfire in humiliating ways), and the character's barely-hidden jealousy of his more successful celebrity friends. A sneak peek was shown as a segment during the 2012 BET Awards and the official promo was released in October 2012.\n\nSpecial guests during the first season include: Laila Ali, Ed O'Neill, Jennifer Freeman, Russell Simmons, Melanie Fiona, Estelle, Cedric the Entertainer, Shane Mosley, Elise Neal, Keri Hilson, La La Anthony, Rocsi Diaz, Alec Mapa, Terry Crews, Tisha Campbell-Martin, Takhorra Taylor, Young Jeezy, Nicole Ari Parker, Jay Leno, Ed O'Neill, Shaquille O'Neal, Faizon Love, James Davis, Common and Trey Songz.\n\nSeason 2 guest stars include Chris Rock, Conan O'Brien, Wanda Sykes, Katie Couric, Keenen Ivory Wayans, Nadine Velazquez, Kelly Rowland, Bobby Brown, Ralph Tresvant, Tichina Arnold, James Davis, Wayne Brady, Eric Benet, Selita Ebanks, Eva Marcille, Erykah Badu, and more.\n\nSeason 3: Tamar Braxton, Mariah Carey, Regina Hall, Sanaa Lathan, George Lopez, Snoop Dogg, Jennifer Freeman, Lance Bass, Chrisette Michele, Jessica White, Fred Williamson, and more.\n\nSeason 4: Bobby Shmurda, Chris Brown, Brandy, Nia Long, Arsenio Hall, Wayne Brady, Mary J.

The following day, on October 16, 2013, the show began airing on The Comedy Channel in Australia. In April 2014, \"Real Husbands of Hollywood\" was renewed for a third season, which premiered on October 14, 2014.\n\nThe fourth season premiered on August 18, 2015. On January 21, 2016, the show was renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on October 11, 2016.\n\nThe show has received positive reviews from critics. \"Entertainment Weekly\" chose the show as No.1 for their \"The Must List: The Top 10 Things We Love This Week,\" writing, \"Step aside, \"Housewives\"!

{"id": "5778022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5778022", "title": "Regional accreditation", "text": "Regional accreditation\n\nRegional accreditation is the educational accreditation of schools, colleges, and universities in the United States by one of seven regional accrediting agencies. Accreditation is a voluntary process by which colleges demonstrate to each other, and sometimes to employers and licensing agencies, that their credits and degrees meet minimum standards. It is the self-regulation of the higher education industry.\n\nEach regional accreditor oversees the vast majority of public and private educational institutions, both not-for-profit and for-profit, in its region. Their primary function is accreditation of post-secondary institutions, though there is a limited amount of accreditation of primary and secondary schools.\n\nWhile it might seem that national accreditation would be more important than regional accreditation, this is generally not the case. Regional accreditation is older, and with a few exceptions, more prestigious than national accreditation. Most non-profit institutions are regionally accredited, while most for-profit colleges and universities are served primarily by national accrediting agencies.\n\nThe following are the seven active regional accrediting agencies for educational institutions in the United States:\n\n\nThe seven organizations form the Council of Regional Accrediting Commissions (C-RAC). Each regional accrediting commission's executive directors and commission chairs sit on C-RAC and periodically promulgate principles and guidelines which are followed by the regional commissions. Although the principles do not replace individual commission regulations, they provide a basis for assessing accreditation practice between regions.\n\nAll regional agencies have accrediting authority for colleges and universities, 2-year, 4-year, or both. Some agencies also have accrediting authority over K-12 schools (primary and secondaryschools). Both the northwestern and mid-Atlantic regions divide responsibility between two separate accreditation agencies with one focusing on primary and secondary schools and the other focusing on postsecondary institutions. In the western region, there is a separate commission that accredits 2-year colleges.\n\nThe regional accrediting agencies were established in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in response to a perceived need for better articulation between secondary schools and higher education institutions (the school offered the courses the college needed applicants to have taken; this helped colleges and universities evaluate prospective students). The New England Association was formed in 1885 by a group of schoolmasters of secondary schools. The Middle States Association formed in 1887. The faculty of Vanderbilt University led the establishment of the Southern Association in 1895, and the North Central Association was organized the same year at a meeting of 36 administrators of midwestern schools, colleges, and universities. The Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools (predecessor of the two organizations that now serve that region) was formed in 1917 and the Western Association was founded in 1923.\n\nInitially the main focus of the organizations was on accreditation of secondary schools and establishment of uniform college entrance requirements. Regional accreditation replaced other methods, such as the Association of American Universities's \"AAU Accepted List\" (1914-1948).\n\nAccreditation first emerged as a regional rather than national activity because it typically involved site visits, and the fastest transportation available at the time was the railroad.\n\nRegionally accredited institutions are usually academically oriented, state-owned or non-profit private institutions. Nationally accredited schools are usually career-oriented and for profit. Both regional and national accreditations are recognized by the United States Department of Education (U.S.DoED) , the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA).\n\nEvery college in the United States has the right to set standards and to accept or refuse to accept transfer credits. If a student has attended a school that is not regionally accredited, it may be difficult or impossible to have the credits, or even the degree earned, recognized by a regionally accredited college (or employer). A 2005 study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that, in making decisions on credit transfer, about 84 percent of U.S. higher education institutions considered whether the sending institution is accredited, and many had policies stating that they would accept credits only from regionally accredited institutions. About 63 percent of institutions told the GAO that they would accept credit from any regionally accredited institution, but only 14 percent similarly accepted credits from nationally accredited schools. Regionally accredited institutions are reluctant to accept credits from nationally accredited institutions due, in part, to national accreditors' less stringent standards for criteria such as faculty qualifications and library resources. Students who anticipate transferring credits from a nationally accredited school to a regionally accredited one are advised to verify in advance that the credits will be accepted.\n\nIn general, the names of U.S. post-secondary institutions and their degree titles do not indicate whether the institution is accredited or the type of accreditation it holds. Rules on this topic vary from state to state. For example, Tennessee Higher Education Commission regulations require that post-secondary institutions in the state of Tennessee must be regionally accredited to use the word \"university\" in their names, and that a school lacking regional accreditation may not use the word \"college\" in its name without adding a qualifier such as \"career\", \"vocational\", \"business\", \"technical\", \"art\", \"Bible\", or \"Christian\". Tennessee rules also specify that only regionally accredited schools can issue liberal arts degrees or degree titles such as Associate of Arts or Science and Bachelor of Arts or Science.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46613571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46613571", "title": "Romney Literary Society", "text": "Romney Literary Society\n\nThe Romney Literary Society (also known as the Literary Society of Romney) existed from January 30, 1819, to February 15, 1886, in Romney, West Virginia. Established as the Polemic Society of Romney, it became the first organization of its kind in the present-day state of West Virginia, and one of the first in the United States. The society was founded by nine prominent men of Romney with the objectives of advancing literature and science, purchasing and maintaining a library, and improving educational opportunities.\n\nThe society debated an extensive range of scientific and social topics, often violating its own rules which banned religious and political subjects. Even though its membership was relatively small, its debates and activities were frequently discussed throughout the Potomac Highlands region, and the organization greatly influenced trends of thought in the Romney community and surrounding areas.\n\nThe society's library began in 1819 with the acquisition of two books; by 1861, it had grown to contain approximately 3,000 volumes on subjects such as literature, science, history, and art. The organization also sought to establish an institution for \"the higher education of the youth of the community.\" In 1820, as a result of this initiative, the teaching of the classics was introduced into the curriculum of Romney Academy, thus making the institution the first school of higher education in the Eastern Panhandle. In 1846, the society constructed a building which housed the Romney Classical Institute and its library, both of which fell under the society's supervision. The institute was administered by noted Presbyterian Reverend William Henry Foote. Following a dispute with the society, Foote founded a rival school in Romney, known as the Potomac Seminary, in 1850.\n\nThe Romney Literary Society and the Romney Classical Institute continued to grow in influence until the onset of the American Civil War in 1861. The contents of the society's library were plundered by Union Army forces, and only 400 of the library's volumes could be recovered following the war's end in 1865. Reorganized in 1869, the society took a leading role in Romney's civil development during Reconstruction. Between 1869 and 1870, it completed construction of Literary Hall, where the society held meetings and reassembled its library. The organization used its influence to secure the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind for the town of Romney, and offered the school its former Romney Classical Institute campus. The schools opened on September 29, 1870. Interest in the society waned during its final years, and its last recorded meeting was held in 1886.\n\nThe Romney Literary Society was organized on January 30, 1819, by nine prominent men of Romney in the office of Dr. John Temple, a reputable physician in the community. The society was formed with the purpose \"of taking into consideration the propriety of financing a Society, having for its object the advancement of Literature and Science, the purchase of a Library by and for the use of its members; and their further improvement by discussing before the Society such questions as shall be selected under its directors.\" With its establishment, the Romney Literary Society became the first organization of its kind in the present-day state of West Virginia, and one of the first in the United States. The nine men at the society's first meeting were Thomas Blair, David Gibson, James P. Jack, Samuel Kercheval, Jr., Nathaniel Kuykendall, Charles T. Magill, James M. Stephens, John Temple, and William C. Wodrow. According to historian Hu Maxwell, these men elected Kuykendall as chairman and Magill as secretary of a committee which was charged with the drafting of a constitution for the society.\n\nOn February 4, 1819, the committee delivered its draft of the constitution and the society adopted the document, which provided that the organization should be known as the Polemic Society of Romney. The society's constitution also specified that the officers should consist of a president, secretary, and treasurer, each of whom was to be selected by a ballot vote. The constitution further stipulated that each member was to pay dues of 50 cents per month, and that the society had the authority to levy further financial contributions from its members as it deemed necessary. The funds collected were to cover the society's operating costs, and the remaining funds were to be used in purchasing books for the library. Under the constitution, the society's meetings were to be held weekly. Following each meeting's business session, a debate or other literary exercises were to be held consisting of topics of general interest of the members. No political or religious discussions were to take place during the debates unless they were of an abstract nature or in general terms. Profane language and \"spirituous liquors\" were also forbidden from the society's meetings, with each offense being punishable with a fine of one dollar. The society's first elected officers were Charles T. Magill as president, William C. Wodrow as secretary, and John Temple as treasurer.\n\nThe society's next meeting was held on February 13, 1819, in the old Hampshire County Courthouse, where the first matter for debate was \"Resolved: That a representative should be governed by instructions from his constituents.\" Following the debate, the decision was rendered in favor of the affirmative. The second meeting, which was held on February 19 of that year at the Romney Academy, debated the question, \"Is an education acquired at the public school or [is] a private tutor to be preferred?\" and the society favored the public school. At this second meeting, the first money appropriated by the society was paid to the doorkeeper for a sum of 25 cents. Also at this second meeting, the treasurer was instructed to purchase a book for use by the secretary, three candlesticks, one pair of snuffers, and three pounds of candles. On February 26, the society argued the question, \"Is a system of banking advantageous to a community?\" The debate ended under the decision that a system of banking was advantageous. The following meeting on March 6 debated a question far more psychological in nature, which was an abstract question of religion: \"Can the human mind, by its own reflection, arrive at the conclusion that the soul is immortal?\" The society decided in the negative. The society also debated and decided in the negative the question, \"Is a protective tariff detrimental to the interests of the country?\"\n\nOne of the society's more spirited debates occurred in May 1822 over the question, \"Is it to the interest of the people of Hampshire to encourage the canalling of the Potomac?\" While no records of the arguments survive, the society decided that the canalling of the Potomac River would be detrimental to the interests of Hampshire County. The debate took place before the construction of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal along the Maryland shore of the Potomac River to the north of Hampshire County. The society's consensus was that a canal on the Potomac would destroy the business of teamsters who hauled merchandise from the east along the Northwestern Turnpike. For this reason, the society and local population of Romney also objected to the construction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. To ensure confidentiality, the society passed a bylaw that enforced a fine of five dollars on any member who published either his own or another member's speeches delivered before the society. As a result of this bylaw, no speeches were ever published. The society adopted a new constitution in 1824.\n\nOver the first ten years of the society's existence, the organization grew in membership and held meetings at least twice a month, and usually four times a month. The society debated an extensive range of subjects including scientific, religious, political, and social topics, often violating the constitution's rules banning religious and political subjects. The society's debates were often acrimonious and regularly spilled beyond the confines of the meetings and into the community. Between January 30, 1819 and January 22, 1830, the society's membership rolls reached 52 members; although as few as 15 members attended the bimonthly meetings, and no more than 17 members were ever present at a meeting.\n\nEven though the Romney Literary Society's membership was relatively small, its debates and activities were frequently discussed throughout the Potomac Highlands region. For this reason, the society greatly influenced trends of thought in the Romney community and surrounding areas. No records of the society's proceedings, works, or membership enrollments spanning the period between January 22, 1830 and 1861 are extant. During this period, the society counted among its members Angus William McDonald, John Baker White, and Robert White.\n\nIn order to fulfill one of its primary purposes of establishing a library for its members, the Romney Literary Society gradually began to acquire volumes for such a use. The society's library began with the April 23, 1819 appropriation for the purchase of two books: Plutarch's \"Parallel Lives\" and Emer de Vattel's \"The Law of Nations\". On July 2, 1819, the balance of available funds in the treasurer's account was two dollars and forty-six cents, but by October 23, there were sufficient funds to purchase the following volumes: Charles Rollin's \"Ancient History\", Lewis' \"Roman History\", and William Robertson's \"History of the Reign of Charles the Fifth\".\n\nNo more volumes were purchased until the end of 1820, when the society acquired the works of Livy, Tacitus, and John Marshall's \"Life of Washington\". Three months later, the society purchased a bookcase for its growing collection. In April 1821, the society further expanded its library with the acquisitions of Nathaniel Hooke's \"Roman History, from the Building of Rome to the Ruin of the Commonwealth\", the works of Herodotus, \"Travels in Greece\", \"Modern Europe\", David Ramsay's \"History of the United States\", and the works of Benjamin Franklin.\n\nIn 1821, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act incorporating the organization as the \"Library Society of Romney.\" The society found the assembly's charter unsatisfactory, as it specified several changes to the organization that the society had not asked for, including the change in its name. The members regarded their society as a \"literary\" society and not a \"library\" one. The society requested that the assembly amend its charter, and after several delays and debates over the new charter, the Virginia General Assembly passed a new act on February 4, 1823, in which the organization was rebranded as \"The Literary Society of Romney.\" The society maintained this long form name throughout the duration of its existence, although it was locally known as the \"Romney Literary Society.\"\n\nWithin the span of ten years, the society's small library grew to contain approximately 3,000 volumes on literature, science, history, and art. These were bound in calfskin and stamped with the seal of the society. The minutes from the society's bimonthly meetings listed the books purchased and the methods by which they were acquired. According to the Federal Writers' Project in their \"Historic Romney 1762–1937\" (1937), the book selections and their acquisition \"indicate that these men possessed real literary judgment and business ability.\"\n\nBy resolutions of the society, the use of the library was for the society's members, and was further extended to \"ministers of the gospel of all denominations \"gratis\".\" Certain citizens of Romney were also granted access to the library, and enjoyed similar privileges as its members.\n\nFrom the organization's foundation, the Romney Literary Society gradually began to recognize that the local subscription school systems provided only elementary and often fragmentary education and no longer satisfied the academic needs of the Romney community. The society periodically engaged in lengthy deliberations on which theories of educational advancement and popular education were preferable. Shortly after its establishment, the society commenced a movement to establish an institution for \"the higher education of the youth of the community.\" In 1820, as a result of this initiative, the teaching of the classics was introduced into the curriculum of Romney Academy, thus making the institution the first school of higher education in the Eastern Panhandle. Under the guidance, leadership, and strict discipline of Dr. Henry Johnston, Romney Academy became widely renowned for its courses in \"higher classics.\" His successor and society member William Henry Foote introduced courses in theology, and the school's enrollment grew to include students preparing for ministry. As the school became more renowned in the South Branch Potomac River valley, pupils came from further and further away. Thomas Mulledy and Samuel Mulledy were among the early instructors at the academy, both of whom later served as presidents of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.\n\nBy 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its facilities in the old stone school building behind the Hampshire County Courthouse. To remedy this, the society instituted a campaign to raise funds for a new school building. On January 6, 1832, the Virginia General Assembly authorized the society to raise an endowment of $20,000 in a lottery for educational purposes. Following a ten-year lapse, the society made arrangements with James Gregory of Jersey City and Daniel McIntyre of Philadelphia to finance a lottery \"for raising a sum of money not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for the purpose of erecting a suitable building for their accommodation, the purchase of library and Philosophical apparatus.\" The lottery was to be conducted over a period of ten years, and sums of $750, $1,000, and $1,500 were to be raised in semiannual installments. The society was successful in raising funds, and in 1845 the society solicited bids for the construction of a new building to house both the academy, the society, and the society's library. The society also used the lottery funds to pay for books for the academy.\n\nOn February 12, 1844, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act authorizing the society to denote the balance of the moneys raised by the lottery to the Romney Academy. The assembly further enacted another legislative act on December 12, 1846, authorizing the Romney Literary Society to \"establish at or near the town of Romney a Seminary of Learning for the instruction of youth in various branches of science and literature; and the Society map appropriate to the same such portion of the property which it now has or may acquire, as it may deem expedient.\" That same year, a new brick neoclassical building was constructed east of Romney, and the society, its library, and Romney Academy relocated to the new facility. The second story of the new building was utilized by the society, with one hall for meetings and the other hall for the society's library. According to Maxwell, \"few schools in the state of Virginia at that time had access to better libraries.\" The new institute building and grounds cost the society about $8,000. Following its move to the new building, the academy was reorganized as the Romney Classical Institute and its activities fell under the supervision of the society. The institute was operated under the principalship of Foote from 1846 until 1849.\n\nIn 1849, the society presented a new code and system of bylaws for the government of the Romney Classical Institute, which reserved to the society the power to appoint assistant teachers, fix the amount of salaries, and provide the conditions and manners of payment and reimbursement. Foote differed with the society over these matters, and he ultimately declined to accept the new bylaws and resigned his leadership position in October 1849; in 1850, he established a rival institution known as the Potomac Seminary. Rather than falling under the patronage of the society, Foote's new institution fell under the control of the Presbyterian church. Following Foote's departure, the society selected Professor E. J. Meany to head the Romney Classical Institute. Despite the schism, the society also provided financial support from the lottery to the Potomac Seminary.\n\nAccording to a \"catalogue of the members and library\" published on June 1, 1849, there were 20 registered members on the rolls who paid $3 each per year to the society's library fund; there were also eight library members who were admitted under certain regulations of the society and who paid the same fees. Members who had use of the library were provided keys and were allowed access to the library at any time. The town's clergymen and the principal of the Romney Classical Institute were the only non-members who were extended privileges to the library. The 1849 \"catalogue\" listed Alfred P. White as the society's librarian and E. J. Meany remained the principal of the institute. After 1853, the society possessed a permanent fund of $12,000, which yielded $720 per year, one half of which was devoted to the support of the Romney Classical Institute.\n\nThe Romney Literary Society and the Romney Classical Institute flourished and continued to grow in importance and influence until the onset of the American Civil War in 1861. Following the war's outbreak, many of the society's members and the institute's professors and older students joined the Confederate States Army and marched to war. During the war, the society suffered extensive losses. The Romney Classical Institute building and its library were considered legitimate plunder by Union Army forces. The society's library was emptied and three-fourths of its volumes were either scattered or destroyed. The most valuable of these volumes were never recovered following the war's end. Its records of proceedings between 1830 and 1861, the period during which the society engaged in most of its notable literary and philanthropic works, were also destroyed during the war.\n\nFollowing the war's end, only 400 out of the library's nearly 3,000 volumes could be recovered, with only 200 of those books remaining on the library's shelves. Between 10 and 20 of the library's recovered volumes only contained three to four of their original books. The value of the recovered volumes was degraded, as many were damaged or broken. The society members that returned home to Romney were too war-weary to revive the society when they discovered the ruins of the Romney Classical Institute and its library, which had been an expensive endeavor to accumulate and took almost a half-century of labor to amass. The Romney Classical Institute was not restored and was in effect disestablished on account of the war.\n\nFollowing the war, the residents of Romney set about repairing public buildings and reestablishing the town's antebellum institutions, including the Romney Literary Society. The society remained on a hiatus until May 15, 1869 when a meeting was held by nine members, as only nine original members had responded to the call for reorganization. These nine members tasked with rebuilding the society were James L. Armstrong, David Entler, William Harper, John C. Heiskell, Andrew Wodrow Kercheval, Samuel R. Lupton, James Parsons, Alfred P. White, and Robert White. These men sought to collect what remained of the library's books and engaged in a campaign to recruit new members, which resulted in the enrollment of 20 younger men over a period of a few years. Many of the men who had been members in 1861 had died during the war, and the recruitment of new members was essential to the revival of the society. Among the new members elected between 1869 and 1886 were John Collins Covell, Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy, Henry Bell Gilkeson, Howard Hille Johnson, and Christian Streit White. The society, with renewed vigor, took a lead role in Romney's civil development during the Reconstruction Era.\n\nBetween 1869 and 1870, the society completed construction of a new two-story brick building on Lot 56 at the corner of West Main and North High Streets known as Literary Hall, where it could hold its meetings and reassemble the remaining volumes from its original library. Literary Hall was built upon the former location of the shuttered Bank of the South Branch of the Potomac. In addition to the 400 volumes that were initially recovered following the war, the society recovered several more volumes from its original library, and set about purchasing new books; the restored library was reopened with about 700 volumes.\n\nAround the time of the society's reorganization in 1869, the state of West Virginia considered the establishment of a school for the deaf and the blind. The society resolved to secure the new state institution for Romney. On April 12, 1870, the society passed a resolution by which the members agreed to deed, free of cost, the buildings and grounds of the Romney Classical Institute.\n\nOn April 20, 1870, the society sent Andrew Wodrow Kercheval and Robert White as representatives to the then-state capital Wheeling to present their formal offer of \"the grounds and buildings of the Romney Classical Institute... to the Board of Regents, free of debt, and in good repair\" on the condition that the proposed school be located in Romney. Clarksburg and Parkersburg also made offers of potential campuses to the state. The offer was made to the Board of Regents of the West Virginia Institute for the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind, as it was then known, and the society's proposal was accepted by the regents after a brief period of deliberation. The society's offer was the only one that included a building upon the grounds.\n\nIt was discovered by the society that in order to follow through with their proposition, it was necessary to raise more than $1,000, which was ostensibly a difficult task during the Reconstruction Era in Romney. On July 11, 1870, the Board of Regents passed a resolution necessitating the subscription of between $1,200 and $1,300 to facilitate the transaction. One hundred and eighteen individuals and firms responded to the board's request with a total subscription of $1,383.60. To make good on its offer, the society also made an appropriation of $320 on July 11 for the purpose of repairing and restoring the former Romney Classical Institute and grounds so that they were satisfactory before they were transferred to the regents. Shortly thereafter, the old institute building and of property were formally transferred to the state of West Virginia.\n\nOn September 29, 1870, the institute, which was later known as the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, opened its doors in the old Romney Classical Institute building with 25 deaf and five blind students. Following its disestablishment in 1916, the adjacent Potomac Academy (formerly Potomac Seminary) grounds were also incorporated into the campus of the Schools for the Deaf and Blind.\n\nDuring a period of ten years spanning from 1870 to 1880, much of Romney's intellectual life centered on Literary Hall. During this time, the society met only occasionally and there were no records of meetings between March 1872 and April 1878. The post-war period of revival was short-lived, as the death of the older members caused interest in the society to wane. The society's meetings occurred less often, and the last recorded meeting of the society was held on February 15, 1886. During the society's second existence, Literary Hall was used as a meeting space by the Freemasons and the Order of the Eastern Star, and the organizations continued to inhabit the hall following the society's disestablishment until its 1974 purchase by attorney Ralph Haines. Also a local historian, Haines restored Literary Hall and used it as his law office and museum. Literary Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1979, and, as of 2004, it is occasionally open to the public. The society's remaining records, dating as early as 1819, remain on display there.\n\nIn describing the efforts of the Romney Literary Society, historian Hu Maxwell, in his \"History of Hampshire County, West Virginia From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present\" (1897), stated that \"the work accomplished by these few energetic citizens of Romney is astonishing.\" Maxwell further asserted, \"No other one thing in the history of the town has had such lasting results for good.\" The society left many lasting impacts upon the town of Romney during its existence and beyond, which included the foundation of a library; the academic and financial support and patronage of the Romney Academy, Romney Classical Institute, and the Potomac Seminary; the civic leadership during the Reconstruction Era; and the influence and assistance in securing the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind. According to Maxwell, without the efforts of the society, the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind could not have been secured for Romney, and would have likely been located elsewhere in the state.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "841521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=841521", "title": "Sergei Parajanov", "text": "Sergei Parajanov\n\nSergei Parajanov (; ; ; ; sometimes spelled Paradzhanov or Paradjanov; January 9, 1924 – July 20, 1990) was a Soviet film director and artist of Armenian descent who made significant contributions to Soviet cinematography through Ukrainian, Georgian, and Armenian cinema. He invented his own cinematic style, which was totally out of step with the guiding principles of socialist realism (the only sanctioned art style in the USSR). This, combined with his controversial lifestyle and behaviour, led Soviet authorities to repeatedly persecute and imprison him, and suppress his films.\n\nAlthough he started professional film-making in 1954, Parajanov later disowned all the films he made before 1965 as \"garbage\". After directing \"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\" (renamed \"Wild Horses of Fire\" for most foreign distributions) Parajanov became something of an international celebrity and simultaneously a target of attacks from the system. Nearly all of his film projects and plans from 1965 to 1973 were banned, scrapped or closed by the Soviet film administrations, both local (in Kiev and Yerevan) and federal (Goskino), almost without discussion, until he was finally arrested in late 1973 on charges of rape, homosexuality and bribery. He was imprisoned until 1977, despite a pleas for pardon from various artists. Even after his release (he was arrested for the third and last time in 1982) he was a \"persona non grata\" in Soviet cinema. It was not until the mid-1980s, when the political climate started to relax, that he could resume directing. Still, it required the help of influential Georgian actor Dodo Abashidze and other friends to have his last feature films greenlighted. His health seriously weakened by four years in labor camps and nine months in prison in Tbilisi, Parajanov died of lung cancer in 1990, at a time when, after almost 20 years of suppression, his films were being featured at foreign film festivals. \nIn January 1988, he said in an interview, \"Everyone knows that I have three Motherlands. I was born in Georgia, worked in Ukraine and I'm going to die in Armenia.\"\nSergei Parajanov is buried at Komitas Pantheon in Yerevan.\n\nParajanov's films won prizes at Mar del Plata Film Festival, Istanbul International Film Festival, Nika Awards, Rotterdam International Film Festival, Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival, São Paulo International Film Festival and others.\n\nParajanov was born Sarkis Hovsepi Parajaniants (Սարգիս Հովսեփի Փարաջանյանց) to artistically gifted Armenian parents, Iosif Paradjanov and Siranush Bejanova, in Tbilisi, Georgia. (The family name of Parajaniants is attested by a surviving historical document at the Sergei Parajanov Museum in Yerevan.) He gained access to art from an early age. In 1945, he traveled to Moscow, enrolled in the directing department at the VGIK, one of the oldest and highly respected film schools in Europe, and studied under the tutelage of directors Igor Savchenko and Aleksandr Dovzhenko.\n\nIn 1948 he was convicted of homosexual acts (which were illegal at the time in the Soviet Union) with a MGB officer named Nikolai Mikava in Tbilisi. He was sentenced to five years in prison, but was released under an amnesty after three months. In video interviews, friends and relatives contest the truthfulness of anything he was charged with. They speculate the punishment may have been a form of political retaliation for his rebellious views.\n\nIn 1950 Parajanov married his first wife, Nigyar Kerimova, in Moscow. She came from a Muslim Tatar family and converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity to marry Parajanov. She was later murdered by her relatives because of her conversion. After her murder Parajanov left Russia for Kiev, Ukraine, where he produced a few documentaries (\"Dumka\", \"Golden Hands\", \"Natalia Uzhvy\") and a handful of narrative films: \"Andriesh\" (based on a fairy tale by the Moldovan writer Emilian Bukov), \"The Top Guy\" (a kolkhoz musical), \"Ukrainian Rhapsody\" (a wartime melodrama), and \"Flower on the Stone\" (about a religious cult infiltrating a mining town in the Donets Basin). He became fluent in Ukrainian and married his second wife, Svitlana Ivanivna Shcherbatiuk, also known as Svetlana Sherbatiuk or Svetlana Parajanov, in 1956. Shcherbatiuk gave birth to a son, Suren, in 1958.\n\nAndrey Tarkovsky's first film \"Ivan's Childhood\" had an enormous impact on Parajanov's self-discovery as a filmmaker. Later the influence became mutual, and he and Tarkovsky became close friends. In 1965 Parajanov abandoned socialist realism and directed the poetic \"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\", his first film over which he had complete creative control. It won numerous international awards and, unlike the subsequent \"The Color of Pomegranates\", was relatively well received by the Soviet authorities. The Script Editorial Board at Goskino of Ukraine praised the film for \"conveying the poetic quality and philosophical depth of M. Kotsiubynsky’s tale through the language of cinema,\" and called it \"a brilliant creative success of the Dovzhenko studio.\" Moscow also agreed to Goskino of Ukraine's request to release the film with its original Ukrainian soundtrack intact, rather than redub the dialogue into Russian for Soviet-wide release, in order to preserve its Ukrainian flavor. (Russian dubbing was standard practice at that time for non-Russian Soviet films when they were distributed outside the republic of origin.)\n\nParajanov departed Kiev shortly afterwards for his ancestors' homeland, Armenia. In 1969, he embarked on \"Sayat Nova\", a film that many consider to be his crowning achievement, though it was shot under relatively poor conditions and had a very small budget. Soviet censors intervened and banned \"Sayat Nova\" for its allegedly inflammatory content. Parajanov re-edited his footage and renamed the film \"The Color of Pomegranates\". Critic Alexei Korotyukov remarked: \"Paradjanov made films not about how things are, but how they would have been had he been God.\" Mikhail Vartanov wrote in 1969 that \"Besides the film language suggested by Griffith and Eisenstein, the world cinema has not discovered anything revolutionarily new until \"The Color of Pomegranates\" ...\".\n\nBy December 1973, the Soviet authorities had grown increasingly suspicious of Parajanov's perceived subversive proclivities, particularly his bisexuality, and sentenced him to five years in a hard labor camp in Siberia for \"a rape of a Communist Party member, and the propagation of pornography.\" Three days before Parajanov was sentenced, Andrei Tarkovsky wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, asserting that \"In the last ten years Sergei Paradjanov has made only two films: \"Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors\" and \"The Colour of Pomegranates\". They have influenced cinema first in Ukraine, second in this country as a whole, and third in the world at large. Artistically, there are few people in the entire world who could replace Paradjanov. He is guilty – guilty of his solitude. We are guilty of not thinking of him daily and of failing to discover the significance of a master.\" An eclectic group of artists, filmmakers and activists protested, to little avail, on behalf of Parajanov, among them Yves Saint Laurent, Françoise Sagan, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Luis Buñuel, Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, Andrei Tarkovsky and Mikhail Vartanov.\n\nParajanov served four years out of his five-year sentence, and later credited his early release to the efforts of the French Surrealist poet and novelist Louis Aragon, the Russian poet Elsa Triolet (Aragon's wife), and the American writer John Updike. His early release was authorized by Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, presumably as a consequence of Brezhnev's chance meeting with Aragon and Triolet at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. When asked by Brezhnev if he could be of any assistance, Aragon requested the release of Parajanov, which was effected by December 1977.\n\nWhile he was incarcerated, Parajanov produced a large number of miniature doll-like sculptures (some of which were lost) and some 800 drawings and collages, many of which were later displayed in Yerevan, where the Sergei Parajanov Museum is now permanently located. (The museum, opened in 1991, a year after Parajanov’s death, hosts more than 200 works as well as furnishings from his home in Tbilisi.) His efforts in the camp were repeatedly compromised by prison guards, who deprived him of materials and called him mad, their cruelty only subsiding after a statement from Moscow admitted that \"the director is very talented.\"\n\nAfter his return from prison to Tbilisi, the close watch of Soviet censors prevented Parajanov from continuing his cinematic pursuits and steered him towards the artistic outlets he had nurtured during his time in prison. He crafted extraordinarily intricate collages, created a large collection of abstract drawings and pursued numerous other avenues of non-cinematic art, sewing more dolls and some whimsical suits.\n\nIn February 1982 Parajanov was once again imprisoned, on charges of bribery, which happened to coincide with his return to Moscow for the premiere of a play commemorating Vladimir Vysotsky at the Taganka Theatre, and was effected with some degree of trickery. Despite another stiff sentence, he was freed in less than a year, with his health seriously weakened.\n\nIn 1985, the slow thaw within the Soviet Union spurred Parajanov to resume his passion for cinema. With the encouragement of various Georgian intellectuals, he created the multi-award-winning film \"Legend of Suram Fortress\", based on a novella by Daniel Chonkadze, his first return to cinema since \"Sayat Nova\" fifteen years earlier. In 1988, Parajanov made another multi-award-winning film, \"Ashik Kerib\", based on a story by Mikhail Lermontov. It is the story of a wandering minstrel, set in the Azeri culture. Parajanov dedicated the film to his close friend Andrei Tarkovsky and \"to all the children of the world\".\n\nParajanov then attempted to complete his final project. He died of cancer in Yerevan, Armenia, on July 20, 1990, aged 66, leaving this final work, \"The Confession\", unfinished. It survives in its original negative as \"\", assembled by his close friend Mikhail Vartanov in 1992. Federico Fellini, Tonino Guerra, Francesco Rosi, Alberto Moravia, Giulietta Masina, Marcello Mastroianni and Bernardo Bertolucci were among those who publicly mourned his death. They sent a telegram to Russia with the following statement: \"The world of cinema has lost a magician\".\n\nDespite having studied film at the VGIK, Parajanov discovered his artistic path only after seeing Andrei Tarkovsky's dreamlike first film \"Ivan's Childhood\". Parajanov was highly appreciated by Tarkovsky himself in \"Voyage in Time\" (\"Always with huge gratitude and pleasure I remember the films of Sergei Parajanov which I love very much. His way of thinking, his paradoxical, poetical... ability to love the beauty and the ability to be absolutely free within his own vision\"), and Michelangelo Antonioni, Francis Ford Coppola, Jean-Luc Godard (\"In the temple of cinema, there are images, light, and reality. Sergei Parajanov was the master of that temple\"), Martin Scorsese, Mikhail Vartanov (\"Probably, besides the film language suggested by Griffith and Eisenstein, the world cinema has not discovered anything revolutionary new until Paradjanov's \"Color of Pomegranates\"\"), Federico Fellini, Tonino Guerra, Giulietta Masina, Francesco Rosi, Alberto Moravia, Bernardo Bertolucci, Marcello Mastroianni.\n\nDespite having many admirers of his art, his vision did not attract many followers. \"Whoever tries to imitate me is lost\", he reportedly said. However, directors such as Theo Angelopoulos, Béla Tarr and Mohsen Makhmalbaf share Parajanov's approach to film as a primarily visual medium rather than as a narrative tool.\n\nThe Parajanov-Vartanov Institute was established in Hollywood in 2010 to study, preserve and promote the artistic legacies of Sergei Parajanov and Mikhail Vartanov.\n\n\nAmong his projects, there also were plans for adapting Longfellow's \"The Song of Hiawatha\", Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", Goethe's \"Faust\", the Old East Slavic poem \"The Tale of Igor's Campaign\", but film scripts for these were never completed.\n\nParajanov's life story provides (quite loosely) the basis for the 2006 novel \"Stet\" by the American author James Chapman.\n\n\nSelected bibliography of books and scholarly articles about Sergei Parajanov.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58904", "title": "Serpent (symbolism)", "text": "Serpent (symbolism)\n\nThe serpent, or snake, is one of the oldest and most widespread mythological symbols. The word is derived from Latin \"serpens\", a crawling animal or snake. Snakes have been associated with some of the oldest rituals known to humankind and represent dual expression of good and evil.\n\nIn some cultures, snakes were fertility symbols. For example, the Hopi people of North America performed an annual snake dance to celebrate the union of Snake Youth (a Sky spirit) and Snake Girl (an Underworld spirit) and to renew the fertility of Nature. During the dance, live snakes were handled and at the end of the dance the snakes were released into the fields to guarantee good crops. \"The snake dance is a prayer to the spirits of the clouds, the thunder and the lightning, that the rain may fall on the growing crops.\" In other cultures, snakes symbolized the umbilical cord, joining all humans to Mother Earth. The Great Goddess often had snakes as her familiars—sometimes twining around her sacred staff, as in ancient Crete—and they were worshiped as guardians of her mysteries of birth and regeneration.\n\nHistorically, serpents and snakes represent fertility or a creative life force. As snakes shed their skin through sloughing, they are symbols of rebirth, transformation, immortality, and healing. The ouroboros is a symbol of eternity and continual renewal of life.\n\nIn some Abrahamic traditions, the serpent represents sexual desire. According to some interpretations of the Midrash, the serpent represents sexual passion. In Hinduism, Kundalini is a coiled serpent.\n\nSerpents are represented as potent guardians of temples and other sacred spaces. This connection may be grounded in the observation that when threatened, some snakes (such as rattlesnakes or cobras) frequently hold and defend their ground, first resorting to threatening display and then fighting, rather than retreat. Thus, they are natural guardians of treasures or sacred sites which cannot easily be moved out of harm's way.\n\nAt Angkor in Cambodia, numerous stone sculptures present hooded multi-headed nāgas as guardians of temples or other premises. A favorite motif of Angkorean sculptors from approximately the 12th century CE onward was that of the Buddha, sitting in the position of meditation, his weight supported by the coils of a multi-headed naga that also uses its flared hood to shield him from above. This motif recalls the story of the Buddha and the serpent king Mucalinda: as the Buddha sat beneath a tree engrossed in meditation, Mucalinda came up from the roots of the tree to shield the Buddha from a tempest that was just beginning to arise.\n\nThe Gadsden flag of the American Revolution depicts a rattlesnake coiled up and poised to strike. Below the image of the snake is the legend, \"Don't tread on me.\" The snake symbolized the dangerousness of colonists willing to fight for their rights and homeland. The motif is repeated in the First Navy Jack of the US Navy.\n\nSerpents are connected with poison and medicine. The snake's venom is associated with the chemicals of plants and fungi that have the power to either heal, poison or provide expanded consciousness (and even the elixir of life and immortality) through divine intoxication. Because of its herbal knowledge and entheogenic association the snake was often considered one of the wisest animals, being (close to the) divine. Its divine aspect combined with its habitat in the earth between the roots of plants made it an animal with chthonic properties connected to the afterlife and immortality. Asclepius, the god of medicine and healing, carried a staff with one serpent wrapped around it, which has become the symbol of modern medicine. Moses also had a replica of a serpent on a pole, the Nehushtan, mentioned in Numbers 21:8.\n\nFollowing Christian tradition, serpents are connected with lies, vengefulness and vindictiveness: \nThis connection also depends in part on the experience that venomous snakes often deliver deadly defensive bites without giving prior notice or warning to their unwitting victims. Although a snake is defending itself from the encroachment of its victim into the snake's immediate vicinity, the unannounced and deadly strike may seem unduly vengeful when measured against the unwitting victim's perceived lack of blameworthiness. \n\nEdgar Allan Poe's famous short story \"The Cask of Amontillado\" invokes the image of the serpent as a symbol for petty vengefulness. The story is told from the point of view of the vindictive Montresor, who hatches a secret plot to murder his rival Fortunato in order to avenge real or imagined insults. Before carrying out his scheme, Montresor reveals his family's coat-of-arms to the intended victim: \"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.\" Fortunato, not suspecting that he has offended Montresor, fails to understand the symbolic import of the coat-of-arms and blunders onward into Montresor's trap.\n\nIn Africa the chief centre of serpent worship was Dahomey, but the cult of the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating back to the first quarter of the 17th century. By the conquest of Whydah the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent worshipers, and ended by adopting from them the beliefs which they at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes. Every python of the \"danh-gbi\" kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for killing one, even by accident. \"Danh-gbi\" has numerous wives, who until 1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was excluded; a python was carried round the town in a hammock, perhaps as a ceremony for the expulsion of evils. The rainbow-god of the Ashanti was also conceived to have the form of a snake. His messenger was said to be a small variety of boa, but only certain individuals, not the whole species, were sacred. In many parts of Africa the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives. Among the Amazulu, as among the Betsileo of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes. The Maasai, on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe.\n\nIn ancient Mesopotamia, Nirah, the messenger god of Ištaran, was represented as a serpent on \"kudurrus\", or boundary stones. Representations of two intertwined serpents are common in Sumerian art and Neo-Sumerian artwork and still appear sporadically on cylinder seals and amulets until as late as the thirteenth century BCE. The horned viper (\"Cerastes cerastes\") appears in Kassite and Neo-Assyrian kudurrus and is invoked in Assyrian texts as a magical protective entity. A dragon-like creature with horns, the body and neck of a snake, the forelegs of a lion, and the hind-legs of a bird appears in Mesopotamian art from the Akkadian Period until the Hellenistic Period (323 BCE–31 BCE). This creature, known in Akkadian as the \"mušḫuššu\", meaning \"furious serpent\", was used as a symbol for particular deities and also as a general protective emblem. It seems to have originally been the attendant of the Underworld god Ninazu, but later became the attendant to the Hurrian storm-god Tishpak, as well as, later, Ninazu's son Ningishzida, the Babylonian national god Marduk, the scribal god Nabu, and the Assyrian national god Ashur.\n\nSnake cults were well established in Canaanite religion in the Bronze Age, for archaeologists have uncovered serpent cult objects in Bronze Age strata at several pre-Israelite cities in Canaan: two at Megiddo, one at Gezer, one in the \"sanctum sanctorum\" of the Area H temple at Hazor, and two at Shechem.\n\nIn the surrounding region, serpent cult objects figured in other cultures. A late Bronze Age Hittite shrine in northern Syria contained a bronze statue of a god holding a serpent in one hand and a staff in the other. In 6th-century Babylon, a pair of bronze serpents flanked each of the four doorways of the temple of Esagila. At the Babylonian New Year's festival, the priest was to commission from a woodworker, a metalworker and a goldsmith two images one of which \"shall hold in its left hand a snake of cedar, raising its right [hand] to the god Nabu\". At the tell of Tepe Gawra, at least seventeen Early Bronze Age Assyrian bronze serpents were recovered.\n\nSnakes are sacred and powerful in the thoughts of prehistoric cultures of Iran. It seems that they have worshiped along with the fertility goddesses, from fourth to first millennium BC.; We can detect their presence as mighty patrons and source of life and immortality in the art of Tall-i Bakun, Chogha Mish, Tepe Sialk, Jiroft culture, Shahr-e Sukhteh, Shahdad, Elamite art, Luristan art, etc. Serpents have pictured as patrons of fertility, water and wealth in the ancient objects of Iran.\nHowever, it seems that symbolic concept of serpent has reversed in the cultures of Iranian plateau over time. In Abrahamic traditions, the serpent represents sexual desire, as he lured Eve with the promise of forbidden knowledge in the Garden of Eden. Aryan religions call the serpents diabolic too; Azhi Dahake in Avesta is a scary serpent and Zahhak in the Shahnameh is an infernal creature with two snakes on his shoulders. This replacement might be due to communicating between the inhabitants of Iran and believers in Abrahamic religions and beyond that the conversion of matriarchy into patriarchy, in the social structure of Iranian plateau cultures.\n\nSignificant finds of pottery, bronze-ware and even gold depictions of snakes have been made throughout the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Bronze Age and Iron Age metallurgical centre of Saruq Al Hadid has yielded probably the richest trove of such objects, although finds have been made bearing snake symbols in bronze age sites at Rumailah, Bithnah and Masafi. Most of the depictions of snakes are similar, with a consistent dotted decoration applied to them.\n\nAlthough the widespread depiction of snakes in sites across the UAE is thought by archaeologists to have a religious purpose, this remains conjecture.\n\nIn the Gospel of John 3:14–15, Jesus makes direct comparison between the raising up of the Son of Man and the act of Moses in raising up the serpent as a sign, using it as a symbol associated with salvation: \"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life\".\n\nIn many myths, the chthonic serpent (sometimes a pair) lives in or is coiled around a Tree of Life situated in a divine garden. In the Genesis story of the Torah and Biblical Old Testament, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is situated in the Garden of Eden together with the tree of life and the Serpent. In Greek mythology, Ladon coiled around the tree in the garden of the Hesperides protecting the entheogenic golden apples.\n\nSimilarly Níðhöggr (Nidhogg Nagar), the dragon of Norse mythology, eats from the roots of the Yggdrasil, the World Tree.\n\nUnder yet another Tree (the Bodhi tree of Enlightenment), the Buddha sat in ecstatic meditation. When a storm arose, the mighty serpent king Mucalinda rose up from his place beneath the earth and enveloped the Buddha in seven coils for seven days, so as not to break his ecstatic state.\n\nThe Vision Serpent was also a symbol of rebirth in Mayan mythology, with origins going back to earlier Maya conceptions, lying at the center of the world as the Mayans conceived it. \"It is in the center axis atop the World Tree. Essentially the World Tree and the Vision Serpent, representing the king, created the center axis which communicates between the spiritual and the earthly worlds or planes. It is through ritual that the king could bring the center axis into existence in the temples and create a doorway to the spiritual world, and with it power\". (Schele and Friedel, 1990: 68)\n\nSometimes the Tree of Life is represented (in a combination with similar concepts such as the World Tree and Axis mundi or \"World Axis\") by a staff such as those used by shamans. Examples of such staffs featuring coiled snakes in mythology are the caduceus of Hermes, the Rod of Asclepius, the staff of Moses, and the papyrus reeds and deity poles entwined by a single serpent Wadjet, dating to earlier than 3000 BCE. The oldest known representation of \"two\" snakes entwined around a rod is that of the Sumerian fertility god Ningizzida. Ningizzida was sometimes depicted as a serpent with a human head, eventually becoming a god of healing and magic. It is the companion of Dumuzi (Tammuz), with whom it stood at the gate of heaven. In the Louvre, there is a famous green steatite vase carved for King Gudea of Lagash (dated variously 2200–2025 BCE) with an inscription dedicated to Ningizzida. Ningizzida was the ancestor of Gilgamesh, who, according to the epic, dived to the bottom of the waters to retrieve the plant of life. But while he rested from his labor, a serpent came and ate the plant. The snake became immortal, and Gilgamesh was destined to die.\n\nNingizzida has been popularized in the 20th century by Raku Kei Reiki (a.k.a. \"The Way of the Fire Dragon\"), where \"Nin Giz Zida\" is believed to be a fire serpent of Tibetan rather than Sumerian origin. \"Nin Giz Zida\" is another name for the ancient Hindu concept Kundalini, a Sanskrit word meaning either \"coiled up\" or \"coiling like a snake\". \"Kundalini\" refers to the mothering intelligence behind yogic awakening and spiritual maturation leading to altered states of consciousness. There are a number of other translations of the term, usually emphasizing a more serpentine nature to the word—e.g. \"serpent power\". It has been suggested by Joseph Campbell that the symbol of snakes coiled around a staff is an ancient representation of Kundalini physiology. The staff represents the spinal column with the snake(s) being energy channels. In the case of two coiled snakes, they usually cross each other seven times, a possible reference to the seven energy centers called chakras.\n\nIn Ancient Egypt, where the earliest written cultural records exist, the serpent appears from the beginning to the end of their mythology. Ra and Atum (\"he who completes or perfects\") became the same god, \"Atum\", the \"counter-Ra,\" was associated with earth animals, including the serpent: Nehebkau (\"he who harnesses the souls\") was the two headed serpent deity who guarded the entrance to the underworld. He is often seen as the son of the snake goddess Renenutet. She often was confused with (and later was absorbed by) their primal snake goddess Wadjet, the Egyptian cobra, who from the earliest of records was the patron and protector of the country, all other deities, and the pharaohs. Hers is the first known oracle. She was depicted as the crown of Egypt, entwined around the staff of papyrus and the pole that indicated the status of all other deities, as well as having the all-seeing eye of wisdom and vengeance. She never lost her position in the Egyptian pantheon.\n\nThe image of the serpent as the embodiment of the wisdom transmitted by \"Sophia\" was an emblem used by gnosticism, especially those sects that the more orthodox characterized as \"Ophites\" (\"Serpent People\"). The chthonic serpent was one of the earth-animals associated with the cult of Mithras. The Basilisk, the venomous \"king of serpents\" with the glance that kills, was hatched by a serpent, Pliny the Elder and others thought, from the egg of a cock.\n\nOutside Eurasia, in Yoruba mythology, Oshunmare was another mythic regenerating serpent.\n\nThe Rainbow Serpent (also known as the Rainbow Snake) is a major mythological being for Aboriginal people across Australia, although the creation myth associated with it are best known from northern Australia. In Fiji Ratumaibulu was a serpent god who ruled the underworld and made fruit trees bloom. In the Northern Flinders Ranges reigns The Arkaroo, serpent who drank Lake Frome empty, refuges into the mountains, carving valleys and waterholes, earthquakes through snoring.\n\nThe serpent, when forming a ring with its tail in its mouth, is a clear and widespread symbol of the \"All-in-All\", the totality of existence, infinity and the cyclic nature of the cosmos. The most well known version of this is the Aegypto-Greek Ourobouros. It is believed to have been inspired by the Milky Way, as some ancient texts refer to a serpent of light residing in the heavens. The Ancient Egyptians associated it with Wadjet, one of their oldest deities as well as another aspect, Hathor. In Norse mythology the World Serpent (or Midgard serpent) known as Jörmungandr encircled the world in the ocean's abyss biting its own tail.\n\nIn Hindu mythology Lord Vishnu is said to sleep while floating on the cosmic waters on the serpent Shesha. In the Puranas Shesha holds all the planets of the universe on his hoods and constantly sings the glories of Vishnu from all his mouths. He is sometimes referred to as \"Ananta-Shesha,\" which means \"Endless Shesha\". In the Samudra manthan chapter of the Puranas, Shesha loosens Mount Mandara for it to be used as a churning rod by the Asuras and Devas to churn the ocean of milk in the heavens in order to make Soma (or Amrita), the divine elixir of immortality. As a churning rope another giant serpent called Vasuki is used.\n\nIn pre-Columbian Central America Quetzalcoatl was sometimes depicted as biting its own tail. The mother of Quetzalcoatl was the Aztec goddess Coatlicue (\"the one with the skirt of serpents\"), also known as Cihuacoatl (\"The Lady of the serpent\"). Quetzalcoatl's father was Mixcoatl (\"Cloud Serpent\"). He was identified with the Milky Way, the stars and the heavens in several Mesoamerican cultures.\n\nThe demigod Aidophedo of the West African Ashanti is also a serpent biting its own tail. In Dahomey mythology of Benin in West Africa, the serpent that supports everything on its many coils was named Dan. In the Vodou of Benin and Haiti Ayida-Weddo (a.k.a. Aida-Wedo, Aido Quedo, \"Rainbow-Serpent\") is a spirit of fertility, rainbows and snakes, and a companion or wife to Dan, the father of all spirits. As Vodou was exported to Haiti through the slave trade Dan became Danballah, Damballah or Damballah-Wedo. Because of his association with snakes, he is sometimes disguised as Moses, who carried a snake on his staff. He is also thought by many to be the same entity of Saint Patrick, known as a snake banisher.\n\nThe serpent Hydra is a star constellation representing either the serpent thrown angrily into the sky by Apollo or the Lernaean Hydra as defeated by Heracles for one of his Twelve Labors. The constellation Serpens represents a snake being tamed by Ophiuchus the snake-handler, another constellation. The most probable interpretation is that Ophiuchus represents the healer Asclepius.\n\nOccasionally, serpents and dragons are used interchangeably, having similar symbolic functions. The venom of the serpent is thought to have a fiery quality similar to a fire spitting dragon. The Greek Ladon and the Norse Níðhöggr (Nidhogg Nagar) are sometimes described as serpents and sometimes as dragons. In Germanic mythology, \"serpent\" (Old English: \"wyrm\", Old High German: \"wurm\", Old Norse: \"ormr\") is used interchangeably with the Greek borrowing \"dragon\" (OE: \"draca\", OHG: \"trahho\", ON: \"dreki\"). In China and especially in Indochina, the Indian serpent nāga was equated with the \"lóng\" or Chinese dragon. The Aztec and Toltec serpent god Quetzalcoatl also has dragon like wings, like its equivalent in K'iche' Maya mythology Q'uq'umatz (\"feathered serpent\"), which had previously existed since Classic Maya times as the deity named Kukulkan.\n\nThe Minoan Snake Goddess brandished a serpent in either hand, perhaps evoking her role as source of wisdom, rather than her role as Mistress of the Animals (\"Potnia theron\"), with a leopard under each arm.\n\nSerpents figured prominently in archaic Greek myths. According to some sources, Ophion (\"serpent\", a.k.a. Ophioneus), ruled the world with Eurynome before the two of them were cast down by Cronus and Rhea. The oracles of the Ancient Greeks were said to have been the continuation of the tradition begun with the worship of the Egyptian cobra goddess, Wadjet.\n\nTyphon the enemy of the Olympian gods is described as a vast grisly monster with a hundred heads and a hundred serpents issuing from his thighs, who was conquered and cast into Tartarus by Zeus, or confined beneath volcanic regions, where he is the cause of eruptions. Typhon is thus the chthonic figuration of volcanic forces. Serpent elements figure among his offspring; among his children by Echidna are: Cerberus (a monstrous three-headed dog with a snake for a tail and a serpentine mane); the serpent-tailed Chimaera; the serpent-like chthonic water beast Lernaean Hydra; and the hundred-headed serpentine dragon Ladon. Both the Lernaean Hydra and Ladon were slain by Heracles.\n\nPython was the earth-dragon of Delphi, she always was represented in the vase-paintings and by sculptors as a serpent. Pytho was the chthonic enemy of Apollo, who slew her and remade her former home his own oracle, the most famous in Classical Greece.\nMedusa and the other Gorgons were vicious female monsters with sharp fangs and hair of living, venomous snakes whose origins predate the written myths of Greece and who were the protectors of the most ancient ritual secrets. The Gorgons wore a belt of two intertwined serpents in the same configuration of the caduceus. The Gorgon was placed at the center, highest point of one of the pediments on the Temple of Artemis at Corfu.\n\nAsclepius, the son of Apollo and Koronis, learned the secrets of keeping death at bay after observing one serpent bringing another (which Asclepius himself had fatally wounded) back to life with healing herbs. To prevent the entire human race from becoming immortal under Asclepius's care, Zeus killed him with a bolt of lightning. Asclepius' death at the hands of Zeus illustrates man's inability to challenge the natural order that separates mortal men from the gods. In honor of Asclepius, snakes were often used in healing rituals. Non-poisonous snakes were left to crawl on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. The \"Bibliotheca\" claimed that Athena gave Asclepius a vial of blood from the Gorgons. Gorgon blood had magical properties: if taken from the left side of the Gorgon, it was a fatal poison; from the right side, the blood was capable of bringing the dead back to life. However, Euripides wrote in his tragedy Ion that the Athenian queen Creusa had inherited this vial from her ancestor Erichthonios, who was a snake himself and had received the vial from Athena. In this version the blood of Medusa had the healing power while the lethal poison originated from Medusa's serpents.\n\nOlympias, the mother of Alexander the Great and a princess of the primitive land of Epirus, had the reputation of a snake-handler, and it was in serpent form that Zeus was said to have fathered Alexander upon her. Aeetes, the king of Colchis and father of the sorceress Medea, possessed the Golden Fleece. He guarded it with a massive serpent that never slept. Medea, who had fallen in love with Jason of the Argonauts, enchanted it to sleep so Jason could seize the Fleece. (See Lamia (mythology)).\n\nWhen not driven by horses, the chariot of the Greek sun god is described as being pulled by fiery draconic beings. The most notable instance of this is observed in the episode in which Medea is given her grandfather's chariot, which is pulled by serpents through the sky.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible the serpent in the Garden of Eden lured Eve with the promise of being like God, tempting her that despite God's warning, death would not be the result, that God was withholding knowledge from her. Although the serpent is identified as Satan in the Book of Revelation, in Genesis the serpent is portrayed merely as a deceptive creature or trickster, promoting as good what God had directly forbidden, and particularly cunning in its deception (Gen. 3:4–5 and 3:22). \n\nThe staff of Moses transformed into a snake and then back into a staff (Exodus 4:2–4). The Book of Numbers 21:6–9 provides an origin for an archaic copper serpent, \"Nehushtan\" by associating it with Moses. This copper snake according to the Biblical text is wrapped around a pole and used for healing. Book of Numbers 21:9 \"And Moses made a snake of copper, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a snake had bitten any man, when he beheld the snake of brass, he lived.\"\n\nWhen the reformer King Hezekiah came to the throne of Judah in the late 8th century BCE, \"He removed the high places, broke the sacred pillars, smashed the idols, and broke into pieces the copper snake that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan. ()\n\n\"Naga\" (Sanskrit:नाग) is the Sanskrit/Pāli word for a deity or class of entity or being, taking the form of a very large snake, found in Hinduism and Buddhism. The naga primarily represents rebirth, death and mortality, due to its casting of its skin and being symbolically \"reborn\".\n\nBrahmins associated \"naga\" with Shiva and with Vishnu, who rested on a 100 headed \"naga\" coiled around Shiva’s neck. The snake represented freedom in Hindu mythology because they cannot be tamed.\n\nSerpents, or nāgas, play a particularly important role in Cambodian, Isan and Laotian mythology. An origin myth explains the emergence of the name \"Cambodia\" as resulting from conquest of a naga princess by a Kambuja lord named Kaundinya: the descendants of their union are the Khmer people. George Coedès suggests the Cambodian myth is a basis for the legend of \"Phra Daeng Nang Ai\", in which a woman who has lived many previous lives in the region is reincarnated as a daughter of Phraya Khom (Thai for Cambodian,) and causes the death of her companion in former lives who has been reincarnated as a prince of the Nagas. This leads to war between the \"spirits of the air\" and the Nagas: Nagas amok are rivers in spate, and the entire region is flooded. The Myth of the Toad King tells how introduction of Buddhist teachings led to war with the sky deity Phaya Thaen, and ended in a truce with nagas posted as guardians of entrances to temples.\n\nIn America some of the Native American tribes give reverence to the rattlesnake as grandfather and king of snakes who is able to give fair winds or cause tempest. Among the Hopi of Arizona the serpent figures largely in one of the dances. The rattlesnake was worshiped in the Natchez temple of the sun and the Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl was a feathered serpent-god. In many Meso-American cultures, the serpent was regarded as a portal between two worlds. The tribes of Peru are said to have adored great snakes in the pre-Inca days and in Chile the Mapuche made a serpent figure in their deluge beliefs.\n\nA Horned Serpent is a popular image in Northern American natives' mythology.\n\nIn one Native North American story, an evil serpent kills one of the gods' cousins, so the god kills the serpent in revenge, but the dying serpent unleashes a great flood. People first flee to the mountains and then, when the mountains are covered, they float on a raft until the flood subsides. The evil spirits that the serpent god controlled then hide out of fear. The Mound Builders associated great mystical value to the serpent, as the Serpent Mound demonstrates, though we are unable to unravel the particular associations.\n\nJörmungandr, alternately referred to as the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent, is a sea serpent of the Norse mythology, the middle child of Loki and the giantess Angrboða.\n\nAccording to the Prose Edda, Odin took Loki's three children, Fenrisúlfr, Hel and Jörmungandr. He tossed Jörmungandr into the great ocean that encircles Midgard. The serpent grew so big that he was able to surround the Earth and grasp his own tail, and as a result he earned the alternate name of the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent. Jörmungandr's arch enemy is the god Thor.\n\nIn the Poetic Edda, Odin tells of 8 serpents gnawing on the roots of Yggdrasil: Nidhöggr, Gravvitnir, Moin, Goin, Grábakr, Grafvölluðr, Svafnir and Ofnir.\n\nSea serpents were giant cryptozoological creatures once believed to live in water, whether sea monsters such as the Leviathan or lake monsters such as the Loch Ness Monster. If they were referred to as \"sea snakes\", they were understood to be the actual snakes that live in Indo-Pacific waters (Family Hydrophiidae).\n\nSnakes entwined the staffs both of Hermes (the caduceus) and of Asclepius, where a single snake entwined the rough staff. On Hermes' caduceus, the snakes were not merely duplicated for symmetry, they were paired opposites. (This motif is congruent with the phurba.) The wings at the head of the staff identified it as belonging to the winged messenger, Hermes, the Roman Mercury, who was the god of magic, diplomacy and rhetoric, of inventions and discoveries, the protector both of merchants and that allied occupation, to the mythographers' view, of thieves. It is however Hermes' role as psychopomp, the escort of newly deceased souls to the afterlife, that explains the origin of the snakes in the caduceus since this was also the role of the Sumerian entwined serpent god Ningizzida, with whom Hermes has sometimes been equated.\n\nIn Late Antiquity, as the arcane study of alchemy developed, Mercury was understood to be the protector of those arts too and of arcane or occult \"Hermetic' information in general. Chemistry and medicines linked the rod of Hermes with the staff of the healer Asclepius, which was wound with a serpent; it was conflated with Mercury's rod, and the modern medical symbol—which should simply be the rod of Asclepius—often became Mercury's wand of commerce. Another version is used in alchemy whereas the snake is crucified, known as Nicolas Flamel's caduceus. Art historian Walter J. Friedlander, in \"The Golden Wand of Medicine: A History of the Caduceus Symbol in Medicine\" (1992) collected hundreds of examples of the caduceus and the rod of Asclepius and found that professional associations were just somewhat more likely to use the staff of Asclepius, while commercial organizations in the medical field were more likely to use the caduceus.\n\nFollowing the Christian context as a symbol for evil, serpents are sometimes featured in political propaganda. They were used to represent Jews in antisemitic propaganda. Snakes were also used to represent the evil side of drugs in such films as \"Narcotic\" and \"Narcotics: Pit of Despair\".\n\nThe anthropologist Lynn Isbell has argued that, as primates, the serpent as a symbol of death is built into our unconscious minds because of our evolutionary history. Isbell argues that for millions of years snakes were the only significant predators of primates, and that this explains why fear of snakes is one of the most common phobias worldwide and why the symbol of the serpent is so prevalent in world mythology; the serpent is an innate image of danger and death. \n\nFurthermore, the psychoanalyst Joseph Lewis Henderson and the ethnologist Maude Oakes have argued that the serpent is a symbol of initiation and rebirth precisely because it is a symbol of death.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28412", "title": "Stolen Generations", "text": "Stolen Generations\n\nThe Stolen Generations (also known as Stolen Children) were the children of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent who were removed from their families by the Australian Federal and State government agencies and church missions, under acts of their respective parliaments. The removals of those referred to as \"half-caste\" children were conducted in the period between approximately 1905 and 1967, although in some places mixed-race children were still being taken into the 1970s.\n\nOfficial government estimates are that in certain regions between one in ten and one in three indigenous Australian children were forcibly taken from their families and communities between 1910 and 1970.\n\nNumerous 19th- and early 20th-century contemporaneous documents indicate that the policy of removing mixed-race Aboriginal children from their mothers related to an assumption that the Aborigines were dying off. Given their catastrophic population decline after white contact, whites assumed that the full-blood tribal Aboriginal population would be unable to sustain itself, and was doomed to extinction. The idea expressed by A. O. Neville, the Chief Protector of Aborigines for Western Australia, and others as late as 1930 was that mixed-race children could be trained to work in white society, and over generations would marry white and be assimilated into the society.\n\nSome European Australians considered any proliferation of mixed-descent children (labelled \"half-castes\", \"crossbreeds\", \"quadroons\", and \"octoroons\", terms now considered derogatory to indigenous Australians) to be a threat to the stability of the prevailing culture, or to a perceived racial or cultural \"heritage\". The Northern Territory Chief Protector of Aborigines, Dr. Cecil Cook, argued that \"everything necessary [must be done] to convert the half-caste into a white citizen\".\n\nIn the Northern Territory, the segregation of Indigenous Australians of mixed descent from \"full-blood\" indigenous people began with the government removing children of mixed descent from their communities and placing them in church-run missions, and later creating segregated reserves and compounds to hold all Indigenous Australians. This was a response to public concern over the increase in the number of mixed-descent children and sexual exploitation of young Aboriginal women by non-Indigenous men, as well as fears among non-indigenous people of being outnumbered by a mixed-descent population.\n\nUnder the Northern Territory Aboriginals Act of 1906, The Chief Protector of Aborigines was appointed the \"legal guardian of every Aboriginal and every half-caste child up to the age of 18 years\", thus providing the legal basis for enforcing segregation. After the Commonwealth took control of the Territory, under the 1918 Aborigines Ordinance, the Chief Protector was given total control of all Indigenous women regardless of their age, unless married to a man who was \"substantially of European origin\", and his approval was required for any marriage of an indigenous woman to a non-indigenous man.\n\nThe Victorian Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 included the earliest legislation to authorise child removal from Aboriginal parents. The Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines had been advocating such powers since 1860. Passage of the Act gave the colony of Victoria a wide suite of powers over Aboriginal and \"half-caste\" persons, including the forcible removal of children, especially \"at risk\" girls. Through the late 19th and early 20th century, similar policies and legislation were adopted by other states and territories, such as the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 (Qld), the Aborigines Ordinance 1918 (NT), the Aborigines Act 1934 (SA), and the 1936 Native Administration Act (WA).\n\nAs a result of such legislation, states arranged widespread removal of (primarily) mixed-race children from their Aboriginal mothers. In addition, appointed Aboriginal protectors in each state exercised wide-ranging guardianship powers over Aborigines up to the age of 16 or 21, often determining where they could live or work. Policemen or other agents of the state (some designated as \"Aboriginal Protection Officers\") were given the power to locate and transfer babies and children of mixed descent from their mothers, families, and communities into institutions for care. In these Australian states and territories, institutions (both government and missionary) for half-caste children were established in the early decades of the 20th century to care and educate the mixed-race children taken from their families. Examples of such institutions include Moore River Native Settlement in Western Australia, Doomadgee Aboriginal Mission in Queensland, Ebenezer Mission in Victoria, and Wellington Valley Mission in New South Wales, as well as Catholic missions such as Beagle Bay and Garden Point.\n\nThe exact number of children removed is unknown. Estimates of numbers have been widely disputed. The \"Bringing Them Home\" report says that \"at least 100,000\" children were removed from their parents. This figure was estimated by multiplying the Aboriginal population in 1994 (303,000), by the report's maximum estimate of \"one in three\" Aboriginal persons separated from their families. The report stated that \"between one in three and one in ten\" children were separated from their families. Given differing populations over a long period of time, different policies at different times in different states (which also resulted in different definitions of target children), and incomplete records, accurate figures are difficult to establish. The academic Robert Manne has stated that the lower-end figure of one in 10 is more likely; he estimates that between 20,000 and 25,000 Aboriginal children were removed over six decades, based on a survey of self-identified indigenous people by the television station ABS. According to the \"Bringing Them Home\" report: \n\nThe report closely examined the distinctions between \"forcible removal\", \"removal under threat or duress\", \"official deception\", \"uninformed voluntary release\", and \"voluntary release\". The evidence indicated that in numerous cases, children were brutally and forcibly removed from their parent or parents, possibly even from the hospital shortly after birth, when identified as mixed-race babies. Aboriginal Protection Officers often made the judgement to remove certain children. In some cases, families were required to sign legal documents to relinquish care to the state. In Western Australia, the \"Aborigines Act 1905\" removed the legal guardianship of Aboriginal parents. It made all their children legal wards of the state, so the government did not require parental permission to relocate the mixed-race children to institutions.\n\nIn 1915, in New South Wales, the \"Aborigines Protection Amending Act 1915\" gave the Aborigines' Protection Board authority to remove Aboriginal children \"without having to establish in court that they were neglected.\" At the time, some members of Parliament objected to the NSW amendment; one member stated it enabled the Board to \"steal the child away from its parents.\" At least two members argued that the amendment would result in children being subjected to unpaid labour (at institutions or farms) tantamount to \"slavery\". Writing in the 21st century, Professor Peter Read said that Board members, in recording reasons for removal of children, noted simply \"For being Aboriginal.\" But the number of files bearing such a comment appear to be on the order of either one or two, with two others being noted only with \"Aboriginal\".\n\nIn 1909, the Protector of Aborigines in South Australia, William Garnet South, reportedly \"lobbied for the power to remove Aboriginal children without a court hearing because the courts sometimes refused to accept that the children were neglected or destitute.\" South argued that \"all children of mixed descent should be treated as neglected.\" His lobbying reportedly played a part in the enactment of the \"Aborigines Act 1911.\" This designated his position as the legal guardian of every Aboriginal child in South Australia, not only the so-called \"half-castes\".\n\nThe \"Bringing Them Home\" report identified instances of official misrepresentation and deception, such as when caring and able parents were incorrectly described by Aboriginal Protection Officers as not being able to properly provide for their children. In other instances, parents were told by government officials that their child or children had died, even though this was not the case. One first-hand account referring to events in 1935 stated:\n\nI was at the post office with my Mum and Auntie [and cousin]. They put us in the police ute and said they were taking us to Broome. They put the mums in there as well. But when we'd gone [about ] they stopped, and threw the mothers out of the car. We jumped on our mothers' backs, crying, trying not to be left behind. But the policemen pulled us off and threw us back in the car. They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us. We were screaming in the back of that car. When we got to Broome they put me and my cousin in the Broome lock-up. We were only ten years old. We were in the lock-up for two days waiting for the boat to Perth.\n\nThe report discovered that removed children were, in most cases, placed into institutional facilities operated by religious or charitable organisations. A significant number, particularly females, were \"fostered\" out. Children taken to such institutions were trained to be assimilated to Anglo-Australian culture. Policies included punishment for speaking their local indigenous languages. The intention was to educate them for a different future and to prevent their being socialised in Aboriginal cultures. The boys were generally trained as agricultural labourers and the girls as domestic servants; these were the chief occupations of many Europeans at the time in the largely rural areas outside cities.\n\nA common aspect of the removals was the failure by these institutions to keep records of the actual parentage of the child, or such details as the date or place of birth. As is stated in the report:\nthe physical infrastructure of missions, government institutions and children's homes was often very poor and resources were insufficient to improve them or to keep the children adequately clothed, fed and sheltered.\n\nThe children were taken into care purportedly to protect them from neglect and abuse. However, the report said that, among the 502 inquiry witnesses, 17% of female witnesses and 7.7% of male witnesses reported having suffered a sexual assault while in an institution, at work, or while living with a foster or adoptive family.\n\nDocumentary evidence, such as newspaper articles and reports to parliamentary committees, suggest a range of rationales. Apparent motivations included the belief that the Aboriginal people would die out, given their catastrophic population decline after white contact, the belief that they were heathens and were better off in non-indigenous households, and the belief that full-blooded Aboriginal people resented miscegenation and the mixed-race children fathered and abandoned by white men.\n\nThe stated aim of the \"resocialisation\" programme was to improve the integration of Aboriginal people into modern [European-Australian] society, however a recent study conducted in Melbourne reported that there was no tangible improvement in the social position of \"removed\" Aboriginal people as compared to \"non-removed\". Particularly in the areas of employment and post-secondary education, the removed children had about the same results as those who were not removed. In the early decades of the program, post-secondary education was limited for most Australians, but the removed children lagged behind their white contemporaries as educational opportunities improved.\n\nThe study indicated that removed Aboriginal people were less likely to have completed a secondary education, three times as likely to have acquired a police record, and were twice as likely to use illicit drugs as were Aboriginal people who grew up in their ethnic community. The only notable advantage \"removed\" Aboriginal people achieved was a higher average income. The report noted this was likely due to the increased urbanisation of removed individuals, and greater access to welfare payments than for Aboriginal people living in remote communities. There seemed little evidence that removed mixed-race Aborigines had been successful in gaining better work even in urbanised areas.\n\nBy around the age of 18, the children were released from government control. In cases where their files were available, individuals were sometimes allowed to view their own files. According to the testimony of one Aboriginal person:\n\nI was requested to attend at the Sunshine Welfare Offices, where they formerly (sic) discharged me from State ward ship. It took the Senior Welfare Officer a mere 20 minutes to come clean, and tell me everything that my heart had always wanted to know...that I was of \"Aboriginal descent\", that I had a Natural mother, father, three brothers and a sister, who were alive...He placed in front of me 368 pages of my file, together with letters, photos and birthday cards. He informed me that my surname would change back to my Mother's maiden name of Angus.\n\nThe \"Bringing Them Home\" report condemned the policy of disconnecting children from their \"cultural heritage\". One witness said to the commission:\n\nI've got everything that could be reasonably expected: a good home environment, education, stuff like that, but that's all material stuff. It's all the non-material stuff that I didn't have — the lineage... You know, you've just come out of nowhere; there you are.\n\nIn 2015, many of the recommendations of \"Bringing Them Home\" were yet to be fulfilled. In 2017, 35% of all children in out-of-home care in Australia identify as being Aboriginal, an increase from 20% in 1997 when \"Bringing Them Home\" was published.\n\nHistorian Professor Peter Read, then at the Australian National University, was the first to use the phrase \"stolen generation\". He published a magazine article on the topic with this title, based on his research. He expanded the article into a book, \"The Stolen Generations\" (1981). Widespread awareness of the Stolen Generations, and the practices which created it, grew in the late 1980s through the efforts of Aboriginal and white activists, artists, and (Archie Roach's \"Took the Children Away\" and Midnight Oil's \"The Dead Heart\" being examples of the latter). The \"Mabo v Queensland (No 2)\" case (commonly known as the \"Mabo case\") attracted great media and public attention to itself and to all issues related to the government treatment of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, and most notably the Stolen Generations.\n\nIn early 1995, Rob Riley, an activist with the Aboriginal Legal Service, published \"Telling Our Story.\" It described the large-scale negative effects of past government policies that resulted in the removal of thousands of mixed-race Aboriginal children from their families and their being reared in a variety of conditions in missions, orphanages, reserves, and white foster homes.\n\nThe Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's \"National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families\" commenced in May 1995, presided over by the Commission's president Sir Ronald Wilson and its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner Mick Dodson. During the ensuing 17 months, the Inquiry visited every state and Territory in Australia, heard testimony from 535 Aboriginal Australians, and received submissions of evidence from more than 600 more. In April 1997, the Commission released its official \"Bringing Them Home\" report.\n\nBetween the commissioning of the National Inquiry and the release of the final report in 1997, the government of John Howard had replaced the Paul Keating government. At the Australian Reconciliation Convention in May 1997, Howard was quoted as saying: \"Australians of this generation should not be required to accept guilt and blame for past actions and policies.\"\n\nFollowing publication of the report, the parliament of the Northern Territory and the state parliaments of Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales passed formal apologies to the Aborigines affected. On 26 May 1998, the first \"National Sorry Day\" was held; reconciliation events were held nationally, and attended by a total of more than one million people. As public pressure continued to increase on the government, Howard drafted a motion of \"deep and sincere regret over the removal of Aboriginal children from their parents\", which was passed by the federal parliament in August 1999. Howard said that the Stolen Generation represented \"the most blemished chapter in the history of this country.\"\n\nActivists took the issue of the Stolen Generations to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. At its hearing on this subject in July 2000, the Commission on Human Rights strongly criticised the Howard government for its handling of issues related to the Stolen Generations. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination concluded its discussion of Australia's 12th report on its actions by acknowledging \"the measures taken to facilitate family reunion and to improve counselling and family support services for the victims\", but expressed concern: \nthat the Commonwealth Government does not support a formal national apology and that it considers inappropriate the provision of monetary compensation for those forcibly and unjustifiably separated from their families, on the grounds that such practices were sanctioned by law at the time and were intended to \"assist the people whom they affected\".The Committee recommended \"that the State party consider the need to address appropriately the extraordinary harm inflicted by these racially discriminatory practices.\"\n\nActivists highlighted the Stolen Generations and related Aboriginal issues during the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics. They set up a large \"Aboriginal Tent City\" on the grounds of Sydney University to bring attention to Aboriginal issues in general. Cathy Freeman is an Aboriginal athlete who was chosen to light the Olympic flame and won the gold medal in the 400 metre sprint. In interviews, she said that her own grandmother was a victim of forced removal. The internationally successful rock group Midnight Oil attracted worldwide media interest by performing at the Olympic closing ceremony in black sweatsuits with the word \"SORRY\" emblazoned across them.\n\nIn 2000, Phillip Knightley summed up the Stolen Generations in these terms:\n\nThis cannot be over-emphasized—the Australian government literally kidnapped these children from their parents as a matter of policy. White welfare officers, often supported by police, would descend on Aboriginal camps, round up all the children, separate the ones with light-coloured skin, bundle them into trucks and take them away. If their parents protested they were held at bay by police.\n\nAccording to the archaeologist and writer Josephine Flood, \"The well-meaning but ill-conceived policy of forced assimilation of mixed-race Aborigines is now universally condemned for the trauma and loss of language and culture it brought to the stolen children and their families.\"\n\nOne of the recommendations of the 1997 Bringing Them Home report was for Australian parliaments to offer an official apology. A decade later, on 13 February 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd presented an apology to Indigenous Australians as a motion to be voted on by the house. The apology text was as follows:\n\nThe text of the apology did not refer to compensation to Aboriginal people as a whole, nor to members of the Stolen Generations specifically. Rudd followed the apology with a 20-minute speech to the house about the need for this action. The government's apology and his speech were widely applauded among both Indigenous Australians and the non-indigenous general public.\n\nOpposition leader Brendan Nelson also delivered a 20-minute speech. He endorsed the apology but in his speech Nelson referred to the \"under-policing\" of child welfare in Aboriginal communities, as well as a host of social ills blighting the lives of Aboriginal people. His speech was considered controversial and received mixed reactions. Thousands of people who had gathered in public spaces in around Australia to hear the apology turned their backs on the screens that broadcast Nelson speaking. In Perth, people booed and jeered until the screen was switched off. In Parliament House's Great Hall, elements of the audience began a slow clap, with some finally turning their backs.\n\nThe apology was unanimously adopted by the House of Representatives, although six members of Nelson's opposition caucus left the House in protest at the apology. Later that day, the Senate considered a motion for an identical apology, which was also passed unanimously. Beforehand, the Leader of the Greens, Senator Bob Brown, attempted to amend the motion to include words committing parliament to offering compensation to those who suffered loss under past indigenous policies, but was opposed by all the other parties.\n\nThe legal circumstances regarding the Stolen Generations remain unclear. Although some compensation claims are pending, a court cannot rule on behalf of plaintiffs simply because they were removed, because, at the time, such removals were authorised under Australian law. Australian federal and state governments' statute law and associated regulations provided for the removal from their birth families and communities of known mixed-race Aboriginal children, or those who visibly appeared mixed.\n\nCompensation claims have been heard by the NSW Supreme Court's Court of Appeal in \"Williams v The Minister Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 and New South Wales\" [2000] NSWCA 255 and the Australian Federal Court in \"Cubillo v Commonwealth of Australia\" [2000] FCA 1084. In \"Williams\", an individual (rather than a group of plaintiffs) made claims in negligence arising from having been placed under the control of the Aborigines Welfare Board pursuant to s 7(2) of the \"Aborigines Welfare Act 1909\" shortly after her birth, and was placed by the Board with the United Aborigines Mission at its Aborigines Children Home at Bomaderry near Nowra, NSW. The trial judge found that there was no duty of care and therefore that an action in negligence could not succeed. This was upheld by the NSW Court of Appeal in 2000.\n\nIn relation to whether the action in NSW courts was limited by the passage of time, the Court of Appeal, reversing Studdert J, extended the limitation period for the non-equitable claims by about three decades pursuant to s 60G of the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW): Williams v Minister, Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (1994) 35 NSWLR 497.\n\nThe apology is not expected to have any legal effect on claims for compensation.\n\nThe word \"stolen\" is used here to refer to the Aboriginal children having been taken away from their families. It has been in use for this since the early 20th century. For instance, Patrick McGarry, a member of the Parliament of New South Wales, objected to the \"Aborigines Protection Amending Act 1915\" which authorised the Aborigines' Protection Board to remove Aboriginal children from their parents without having to establish cause. McGarry described the policy as \"steal[ing] the child away from its parents\".\n\nIn 1924, the \"Adelaide\" \"Sun\" wrote: \"The word 'stole' may sound a bit far-fetched but by the time we have told the story of the heart-broken Aboriginal mother we are sure the word will not be considered out of place.\"\n\nIn most jurisdictions, Indigenous Australians were put under the authority of a Protector, effectively being made wards of the State. The protection was done through each jurisdiction's Aboriginal Protection Board; in Victoria and Western Australia these boards were also responsible for applying what were known as \"Half-Caste Acts\".\n\nMore recent usage has developed since Peter Read's publication of \"The Stolen Generations: The Removal of Aboriginal Children in New South Wales 1883 to 1969\" (1981), which examined the history of these government actions. The 1997 publication of the government's \"Bringing Them Home – Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families\" heightened awareness of the Stolen Generations. The acceptance of the term in Australia is illustrated by the 2008 formal apology to the Stolen Generations, led by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and passed by both houses of the Parliament of Australia. Previous apologies had been offered by State and Territory governments in the period 1997–2001.\n\nThere is some opposition to the concept of the term \"Stolen Generations\". Former Prime Minister John Howard did not believe the government should apologise to the Australian Aborigines. Then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs John Herron disputed usage of the term in April 2000. Others who disputed the use of the term include Peter Howson, who was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from 1971 to 1972, and Keith Windschuttle, an Australian historian who argues that various abuses towards Australian Aborigines have been exaggerated and in some cases invented. Many historians argue against these denials, including to Windschuttle in particular. Anthropologist Ron Brunton also criticised the proceedings on the basis that there was no cross-examination of those giving their testimonies or critical examination of the factual basis of the testimony.\n\nThe \"Bringing Them Home\" report provided extensive details about the removal programs and their effects. Sir Ronald Wilson, former President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission and a Commissioner on the Inquiry, stated that \"when it comes to the credibility of those stories, there is ample credibility, not from the cross-examination of the children themselves, but from the governments whose laws, practices and policies enabled these forced removals to take place. We had the support of every State government; they came to the Inquiry, came with lever-arch files setting out the laws from the earliest days right up to the end of the assimilation policy, that is up to the 1970s and more importantly, senior government offices attended. In every case, these senior officers acknowledged that there was a lot of cruelty in the application of those laws and policies.\"\n\nIn April 2000, Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron tabled a report in the Australian Parliament in response to the Human Rights Commission report which stated that, as \"only 10% of Aboriginal children\" had been removed, they did not constitute an entire \"generation\". The report attracted media attention and protests. Herron apologised for the \"understandable offence taken by some people\" as a result of his comments, although he refused to alter the report as it had been tabled. \n\nHistorian Peter Read referred to the children affected as the \"Stolen Generations\". Another historian, Robert Manne, defended that terminology, making the analogy that other people refer to the \"generation that lost their lives in the First World War\" without meaning over 50 per cent of the young people at the time; rather, people use that phrasing as a metaphor for a collective experience. Similarly, he believes, some of the Aboriginal community use the term to describe their collective suffering.\n\nThere is ongoing contention among politicians, commentators, and historical, political, and legal experts as to whether the forced removals of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children that occurred during the Stolen Generations can be accurately described as genocidal acts and particularly whether they meet the definition of genocide in article II (e) of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. While it is generally not disputed that these forced removals occurred, the contention surrounds whether they were enacted with the intention of destroying the Indigenous people of Australia. There is further contention as to whether those responsible for the Stolen Generations should be criminally liable for genocide. In response to a submission by the National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Services Secretariat to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, Commissioner Johnston considered whether the policies and practices of the Australian Governments pertinent to the Stolen Generations constituted a breach of the Convention but concluded that \"[i]t is not my function to interpret the Convention or to decide whether it has been breached, particularly since the policies involved were modified in 1962 somewhat and abandoned by 1970\". The \"Bringing Them Home\" report concluded that: The Australian practice of Indigenous child removal involved both systematic racial discrimination and genocide as defined by international law. Yet it continued to be practised as official policy long after being clearly prohibited by treaties to which Australia had voluntarily subscribed. However, in the subsequent case of \"Kruger v Commonwealth\", the High Court judges rejected the claim of the plaintiffs that the \"Aboriginals Ordinance 1918\" authorised genocide as defined by the Convention and ruled that there was no legislation to implement the Convention under Australian municipal law at the time. One of the recommendations of the \"Bringing Them Home\" report was that 'the Commonwealth legislate to implement the Genocide Convention with full domestic effect'. While genocide has been a crime under international law since the commencement of the Convention in 1951, in accordance with Section 51(xxix) of the Australian Constitution, it has only been a crime under Australian law since the commencement of the \"International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002\", and so the Stolen Generations cannot be considered genocide under Australian law because the Act is not retrospective. In its twelfth report to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Australian Government argued that the removal policies and programs did not constitute a breach of the Convention.\n\nSir Ronald Wilson, then President of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, commissioner of the \"National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families\", and co-author of the \"Bringing Them Home\" report, argued that the policies resulting in the Stolen Generations constitute attempted genocide by the government, as it was widely believed at the time that the Aborigines would die out.\n\nManne argues that the expressed views of government bureaucrats, such as A. O. Neville, to assimilate the mixed-race children into the white population by means of \"breeding out the colour\", and therefore eventually resulting in the full-bloods being \"forgotten\", bore strong similarities to the racial views of the Nazis in 1930s Nazi Germany. Manne points out that, though the term \"genocide\" had not yet entered the English language, the policies of Neville and others were termed by some contemporaries as the \"die out\" or \"breed out\" policy, giving an indication of their proposed intent. He also states that academics \"generally acknowledge\" that the authors of the \"Bringing Them Home\" report were wrong to argue that Australian authorities had committed genocide by removing indigenous children from their families. Social assimilation has never been regarded in law as equivalent to genocide.\n\nThough historian Paul Bartrop rejects the use of the word genocide to describe Australian colonial history in general, he does believe that it applies to describing the Stolen Generations. Bartrop and US scholar Samuel Totten together wrote the \"Dictionary of Genocide\", for which Bartrop wrote the entry on Australia. He said he used as the benchmark for usage of the term genocide the 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which is also cited in the \"Bringing Them Home\" report.\n\nHistorian Inga Clendinnen suggests that the term genocide rests on the \"question of intentionality\", saying: \"There's not much doubt, with great murderous performances that were typically called genocide, that they were deliberate and intentional. Beyond that, it always gets very murky.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the same period from the 1930s to 1982, 250,000 Australian-born non-Indigenous children were also removed from parents who were deemed \"unfit\". At the time this was widely seen as a positive thing by society for both the mothers and the children. The term \"white stolen generations\" is now used to distinguish this group from the Indigenous stolen generations. The mothers were sometimes drugged, tied to beds, or told their babies had died. Many hospitals engaged in what is now known as institutionalised baby farming, these babies were often adopted into middle class families.\n\nOrganisations such as the \"Apology Alliance\" and \"Adoption Loss Adult Support\" have actively campaigned for a parliamentary apology similar to that given for the Aboriginal Stolen Generations. In 2001, then treasurer of NSW Michael Egan made a statement of public acknowledgement in the NSW Parliament. In October 2010, West Australian Premier Colin Barnett delivered a parliamentary apology on behalf of state institutions involved in the aggressive adoption practices. Prime Minister Julia Gillard made a personal public apology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Firm's divisions also include a record label and a marketing group.\n\nThe Firm was founded by managers Jeff Kwatinetz and Michael Green in 1997. Operating originally out of Kwatinetz' Malibu apartment, the company was described by the Los Angeles Times as \"racing through the music industry with the velocity of a bullet train\" and by 2000 represented a stable of actors and musicians that had generated more than $1.5 billion in gross revenue. Kwatinetz partnered with David Baram and Rick Yorn to help run the operation later bringing on new talent including Criss Angel and Denzel Washington.\n\nIn 2002 The Firm purchased Michael Ovitz's Artist Management Group (AMG) and in 2004 it merged with entertainment consulting company Integrated Entertainment Partners (IEP), led by Rich Frank, a former president of Disney studios. During its first incarnation, the company represented Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Robert De Niro, Kelly Clarkson, Korn, Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg, Dixie Chicks, Linkin Park, Backstreet Boys, Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears, Limp Bizkit, and DC Pierson, among others. In addition to the individual successes of their clients, the company was noted for its prescience in melding celebrities with consumer brands and for its role as an architect of the $2.6 billion acquisition of Warner Music by a private equity consortium.\n\nThe Firm ceased operations in 2008.\n\nSeveral months after the Firm was closed, Kwatinetz and Frank founded Prospect Park, an entertainment company which replicated the scope of The Firm. Financed through Kwatinetz' personal assets, Prospect Park focused on TV and film development and production, and included an artist management division and a record company. In 2013 it launched the short-lived Online Network with the soap operas \"One Life to Live\" and \"All My Children\". The company shut down both shows in 2013 as it filed a lawsuit against ABC, from whom they had licensed the rights to both series. Prospect Park declared bankruptcy in 2014 pending an outcome on the lawsuit.\n\nIn August 2015 it was announced that the Firm had been reactivated, a decision which Kwatinetz said was based on feedback from the creative community. Prospect Park senior executives Jeremy Summers, Angelica Cob-Baehler and Josh Barry transitioned to The Firm, and Robbie Brenner, formerly the president of production at Relativity Media, was named president of The Firm's film division shortly after the company relaunched.\n\nUnder the banner of Prospect Park Productions, the Firm produces the television series \"Salem\" for WGN America and USA Network's \"Royal Pains\"; as of 2015, \"Salem\" was in its third season and \"Royal Pains\" in its eighth. As of 2015, the company had projects in development for broadcast, cable and digital platforms which included \"Black Heart\" for ABC, \"Talent\" for NBC, \"Tough Love\" for Amazon, \"Hard Foul\" for Showtime, \" A Midsummer’s Nightmare\" (Lifetime), \"Relics\" (Sony International Networks), and a Christina Aguilera co-produced ABC Family program tentatively titled \"Hearts and Clubs\".

It was written by Marc Wilmore and directed by David Silverman. Terry Bradshaw and Dennis Rodman guest star as themselves. Around 11.63 million Americans tuned in to watch the episode during its original broadcast.\n\nIn the opening, Kang hopes to speed up an exceedingly slow and boring baseball game, but ends up destroying the universe when the baseball players go so fast, they turn into a killer vortex which sucks up the universe, even God. When everything was sucked up by the baseball players, Kang places a post-it note revealing the title of the episode.\n\nIn a parody of \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\", Bart winds up in a two-week coma after attempting to jump out of a window into a swimming pool. The family takes in a robotic boy, named David, who quickly proves to be a better son. Bart wakes up from his two-week coma and competes against David for the affection of the rest of his family. However, Bart is dumped on a road by Homer, who decided with Marge to keep David as their son. When Bart finds a group of old rusty robots, he steals their parts and becomes a devil-possesed cyborg. He returns home, saws David in half with a chainsaw, but does the same to Homer. Although the family is now together again, Homer is angry that he has to be fused with David's lower half.

As a result, her reward is rescinded because she is not in actual costume and is setenced to four weeks in jail as a punishment for admitting a secret silliness. In anger of such harsh punishment, she turns everyone into their costumed characters, just before being put into custody. The only person who can reverse the spell is Maggie, who was costumed as a witch.

The festival of the Lunar New Year is celebrated by the Mongols along with the people of the Arctic.\n\nThe White Moon festival is celebrated on the first through third days of the first lunar month. Tibet's Losar occurs on the same day as the Mongolian White Moon.\nTsagaan Sar is one of the most important Mongolian holidays.\n\nThe customs of Tsagaan Sar are significantly different depending on the region. In Mongolia around the New Year for example, families burn candles at the altar symbolizing Buddhist enlightenment. Also people greet each other with holiday-specific greetings such as Амар байна уу? (Amar baina uu?), meaning \"Are you living peacefully?\" Mongols also visit friends and family on this day and exchange gifts. A typical Mongol family will meet in the home dwelling of the eldest in the family. Many people will be dressed in full garment of national Mongol costumes. When greeting their elders during the White Moon festival, Mongols perform the zolgokh greeting, grasping them by their elbows to show support for them. The eldest receives greetings from each member of the family except for his/her spouse. During the greeting ceremony, family members hold long, typically blue, silk cloths called a \"khadag\". After the ceremony, the extended family eats sheep's tail, mutton, rice with curds, dairy products, and buuz. It is also typical to drink airag and exchange gifts.\n\nThe day before Tsagaan Sar is called \"Bituun\", the name of the lunar phase of a new or dark moon. The lunar phases are Bituun (dark moon), Shined (new crescent moon), Tergel (full moon), and Huuchid (waxing moon). On the Bituun day, people thoroughly clean around home, herders also clean the livestock barns and shades, to meet the New Year fresh. The Bituun ceremony also includes burning candles to symbolize enlightenment of the samsara and all sentient beings and putting three pieces of ice at the doorway so that the horse of the deity Palden Lhamo could drink as the deity is believed to visit every household on this day. In the evening, families gather together—usually immediate family, in contrast to the large feast gatherings of White Moon day — and see out the old year eating dairy products and buuz. Traditionally, Mongolians settle all issues and repay all debts from the old year by this day.\n\nDepending on the region, food is prepared in a diverse array of forms. For example, the traditional food in Mongolia for the festival includes dairy products, rice with curds (tsagaa-цагаа) or rice with raisins (berees-бэрээс), a pyramid of traditional cookies erected on a large dish in a special fashion symbolising Mount Sumeru or Shambhala realm, a grilled side of sheep and minced beef or minced mutton steamed inside pastry, steamed dumplings known as buuz, horse meat and traditional cookies. Tsagaan Sar is a lavish feast, requiring preparation days in advance, as the men and women make large quantities of buuz as a whole family, along with ul boov, a pastry reserved for both dessert and presentation.\n\nDuring Mongolia's Communist period, the government banned Tsagaan Sar and tried to replace it with a holiday called \"Collective Herder's Day\", but the holiday was practiced again after the 1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia.\n\nThe Mongol calendar in the Tegus Buyantu (Төгсбуянт) system is a lunisolar calendar. The Tegus Buyantu astrology was developed by Mongol high priest Luvsandanzanjantsan (1639–1704), the first reincarnation of the Blama-yin Gegegen (Ламын гэгээн).\nTsagaan Sar is celebrated on the first through third days of the first lunar month.\n\n"}

Children's KSO, Sprint and Speed styles are available.\n\nUnlike traditional footwear, Vibram FiveFingers do not follow the typical US or UK shoe-sizing scales. They require precise foot length measurement with accuracy of 1/8 inch (3 mm) and conversion to the FiveFingers sizing chart. This ranges from 38–50 for men, 34–42 for women, and 29–36 for children. As a result, the shoe sizing more closely mirrors the EU system. However, minor discrepancies exist between the women's and men's sizing, so, \"e.g.\", a women's size 39 does not equal a men's size 39.\n\nVibram FiveFingers comprise many different materials that vary depending on the style of shoe. The most common components are Vibram TC-1 performance rubber, which makes up the sole of these shoes, a thin stretch polyamide comprising the frame of the shoe that molds to the contours of the user's foot, and an antimicrobial microfiber footbed.\n\nIn a report on an article in \"Nature\", co-author Daniel E. Lieberman stated that \"People who wear conventional running shoes tend to run with a significantly different strike than those who run in minimalist shoes or barefoot. By landing on the middle or front of the foot, barefoot runners have almost no impact collision.\" Lieberman et al.'s study was an experiment that involved five groups of runners from Kenya and the United States. The two American groups were adult athletes who had run with shoes since childhood, and those who habitually ran barefoot or with minimal footwear such as Vibram FiveFingers (mentioned by name in the study). The three Kenyan groups were adults who had never run in shoes until late adolescence, as well as two teenage groups: those that habitually wore shoes and those that always ran barefoot. The runners were instructed to run over a force plate that was embedded in a 25-meter track, and were recorded during the run using a three-dimensional infrared kinematic system. These measurements were used to assess the pattern with which the foot strikes the ground and how forcibly it does so.\nBarefoot running, which is similar to running with FiveFingers on, appears to decrease the risk of ankle sprain and plantar fasciitis.\nBecause the Fivefingers lack any support or cushioning (or very minimal at most), the intent is to allow the wearer to engage a natural footstrike, as if he/she would run barefoot. Incorrect, unnatural running forms, especially where a heelstrike is involved, results in the same uncomfortable or painful feedback as when running barefoot, therefore leading the wearer to adjust the stride. This feedback is said to be filtered out of common running shoes because of the thick sole, therefore leading to possible injuries. \n\nIf not conditioned slowly enough, especially when transitioning away from heelstrike running or from wearing shoes with an elevated heel, the sole of the foot or plantar fascia can become inflamed or damaged with activity. Also due to over-training or incorrect form, runners may experience Achilles tendonitis or metatarsal inflammation and fractures. Over-striding in Vibram FiveFingers, that is, landing with the foot too far in front of one's hips, adds extra unnecessary stress to the calf muscles, Achilles tendon, and the arch of the foot, which can lead to serious health problems if not addressed.\n\nOne study found a greater number of new wearers of FiveFingers showed an increase in bone marrow edema than those in the study's control group. It recommended transition to use of the shoe be very slow and gradual.\n\nIn 2012, an initial lawsuit was filed against Vibram over claims made about their FiveFingers minimalist shoe. Vibram claimed that the shoe \"reduce[s] foot injuries and strengthen[s] foot muscles\". While Vibram has \"expressly\" denied \"any actual or potential fault ... or liability\", on May 7, 2014 it was announced that company has moved to settle the suit and agreed to set aside $3.75 million to pay refunds of up to $94 to anyone who had purchased the product since March 21, 2009.\n\n\n"}

It was created by John Lee and Vernon Chatman of PFFR.\n\nDescribed as a children’s show for adults, the show's format is a parody of educational PBS children's television shows such as \"Sesame Street\" and \"The Electric Company\" (e.g. use of stock footage, puppetry, and clips of children being interviewed), parodying the format with adult-oriented content. In addition to general controversial comedy, it satirizes politics, religion, war, sex and culture with black comedy.\n\nEvery episode begins with a disclaimer, which reads:\n\n\"\"Wonder Showzen\" contains offensive, despicable content that is too controversial and too awesome for actual children. The stark, ugly and profound truths \"Wonder Showzen\" exposes may be soul-crushing to the weak of spirit. If you allow a child to watch this show, you are a bad parent or guardian.\"\n\n\"Wonder Showzen\" was created by John Lee and Vernon Chatman, who pitched to the USA Network in 2000, but after a few minutes of viewing, executives there quickly concluded it did not fit the network's programming style. However, Viacom was re-branding MTV2 and made \"Wonder Showzen\" part of its new programming lineup. It aired as part of Sic 'Em Fridays, along with \"Dirty Sanchez\" and \"Wildboyz\". The pilot was named simply \"Kids Show\". The \"Wonder Showzen\" theme song is still 'Kids Show'. Reruns of the show also aired on MTV and Comedy Central.\n\nMTV released the first season of \"Wonder Showzen\" on DVD March 28, 2006. The second season of Wonder Showzen premiered on March 31, 2006 and had its season-two finale starring Clarence on May 19, 2006 on MTV2. This season was released on DVD October 10, 2006, with an easter egg that featured an animation contest. The grand prize was announced as the winner's animation appearing on \"the next DVD\", but the creators later said a third season was unlikely, and MTV afterward canceled the show. A return is even more unlikely as the creators of \"Wonder Showzen\" went on to produce the animated series \"\".\n\nIt aired in Canada on MTV2, the United Kingdom and Ireland on MTV Two, MTV and TMF, Australia on MTV, Germany and Italy on MTV Entertainment, Latin America on MTV Latin America and in the Baltics on MTV Networks Baltic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<onlyinclude>\n</onlyinclude>\n\nMatt Groening, creator of \"The Simpsons\" and \"Futurama\" said \"Wonder Showzen is so weirdly funny the top of your head will burst and your skull will fly out.\"\n\nCartoon Network's Adult Swim said \"It's a show about kids, for freaks, and we love it.\"\n\nA gift set containing Seasons 1 and 2 was scheduled for release on December 12, 2006, but it was canceled.\n\n\n\n"}

It was also spoken by French Jews that moved to Norman England.\n\nThe term \"Zarphatic\", coined by Solomon Birnbaum, comes from the Hebrew name for France, \"Tzarfat\" (צרפת), which had been used in the Hebrew Bible name for the city of Sarepta, in Phoenicia. Some have conjectured that the language was the original language of the Jews who eventually adopted Old High German, which led to the development of Yiddish.\n\nIt was written by a modified Hebrew script and first appeared in the 11th century, in glosses to texts of the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud written by the great rabbis Rashi and Moshe HaDarshan. Constant expulsions and persecutions, resulting in great waves of Jewish migration, brought about the extinction of Zarphatic by the end of the 14th century.\n\nOne feature, unlike most other Indo-European Jewish languages, was that to represent vowel sounds, instead of using Hebrew letters with no matching phonemes in the language, it made extensive use of the Tiberian system of vocalisation to indicate the full range of Old French vowels.\n\nAnother interesting feature was that its vocabulary had relatively few Hebrew loanwords, unlike almost all other Jewish languages.\n\n\n\n"}
