{"id": "1012051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1012051", "title": "Ambush Bug", "text": "Ambush Bug\n\nAmbush Bug is a fictional character who has appeared in several comic books published by DC Comics. His real name is supposedly Irwin Schwab, but he has mental problems that prevent him from truly understanding reality around him, so even his true identity might be no more than a delusion on his part. His origin is disputed, although the most commonly accepted origin is that Brum-El (a historical allusion to Beau Brummel, as well as a reference to Superman's father Jor-El) of the planet Schwab sent his clothes from his supposedly doomed planet, hoping that his wardrobe would survive, only to have it intercepted by a giant radioactive space spider. In the resulting crash, only two articles of clothing survived: the Ambush Bug suit, which was subsequently found by Irwin Schwab; and \"Argh!Yle!\", an argyle sock with a Doctor Doom-like complex, complete with metal mask.\n\nCreated by artist Keith Giffen as an intentionally silly character, Ambush Bug first appeared in \"DC Comics Presents\" #52 (Dec. 1982) and would make appearances in several other Superman-related comic books in the early 1980s. Paul Kupperberg, who wrote Ambush Bug's first story, recalled, \"as Keith was in the office, he sat in on the plotting and offered up Ambush Bug as an antagonist. The Bug is entirely Keith's creation ...\" Giffen has stated that both Ambush Bug and Lobo were derived from Lunatik, a character he created in high school.\n\nIn response to positive reader reaction to the character's first appearance, editor Julius Schwartz directed Giffen to create another Ambush Bug story for \"DC Comics Presents\" #59. At first, Ambush Bug was a villain, named after a type of insect, and dressed in a green, skintight suit (with two orange antennae) that cover his whole body. Inside his hollow antennae, he carries miniature robot bugs that possess the ability to teleport him around. After attacking Superman and other heroes, Ambush Bug decides instead to be a superhero as well. He also fancies himself Superman's friend, which only annoys the hero even more than his early villainy. The costume then becomes permanently affixed to his body, and he gains the power to teleport by himself. While trying to fix one of the miniature bugs, it explodes, causing a chain reaction and a blast that destroys all of the bugs and tints Ambush Bug's costume temporarily black; he then becomes capable of teleporting even without the bugs (briefly considering changing his moniker to Black Beetle instead).\n\nAmbush Bug became popular enough to be featured in two comic book miniseries and several specials, plotted and pencilled by Keith Giffen and scripted by Robert Loren Fleming. The series contains many comic book-enthusiast and DC in-jokes and satire; series editor Julius Schwartz is also a character in the book.\n\nDuring his own 4-part series in 1985, he picks up a doll and, thinking it is alive, \"adopted\" it as a partner called \"Cheeks, The Toy Wonder\", complete with its own costume.\n\nIn 2001, he made his first appearance as part of a superhero group (albeit a small one), the \"Justice League of Anarchy\", which also included Plastic Man, the Creeper, Harley Quinn, 'Mazing Man, and the Trickster. This group of DC Universe troublemakers made a one-panel cameo in a series exploring variations on the JLA acronym, \"JLA: Justice League of Amazons\".\n\nAmbush Bug is largely considered an absurd character and is rarely used by other writers, though he still exists in the DC Universe and occasionally still appears in some DC Comics. His popularity amongst creators has led to many \"cameos\", sometimes with as little as his antennae being visible. In 2006, he appeared as part of Firestorm's short-lived Justice League of America in \"52\" #24. His powers appeared in proxy in \"Countdown to Final Crisis\" #32. Jimmy Olsen briefly gains the appearance of Ambush Bug and subconsciously uses his power of \"Dumb Luck\" to locate Forager.\n\nAfter being championed by DC Coordinating Editor Jann Jones, a new six-issue Ambush Bug miniseries, \"\", debuted in 2008, plotted and pencilled by Giffen, and written by Fleming, with Jones herself serving as editor. The final issue was published almost a year after the rest of the series. Dan DiDio claims to have lost issue #6 and instead they skipped it to finish off with issue #7.\n\nAmbush Bug was seen in the new \"Doom Patrol\" series in 2010 at the end of issue #9, arriving with his luggage and Cheeks. He appeared semi-regularly until the series ended.\n\nAmbush Bug made another appearance, in issue #46 of the outside of regular DC continuity \"Tiny Titans\" series, cover date January 2012.\n\nAmbush Bug is now a news reporter in the feature \"Channel 52\" that appears in the back of all New 52 publications, in which characters acting as correspondents summarize recent events in an in-universe style. Ambush Bug, however, is the only character who appears in costume and, as is typical for his appearances since his creation, appears to understand that he is in a comic book.\n\n\n\nAmbush Bug's primary power is teleportation. At first, this was a function of his suit; he was limited to teleporting to where small receiver bugs were located. Later, after an explosion, Ambush Bug internalized this power. It became apparent, in \"DC Comics Presents\" #81, that the Bug used to have to say \"Simon says\" to teleport, but it is no longer necessary. Ambush Bug is also aware of his fictionality and aware of events in other publishers' comic books. He once was shown being able to follow the internal dialogue between Firestorm's component personalities. Ambush Bug also shows surprising agility and skill at unarmed combat, such as gouging the eyes of enemies attacking him from behind or knocking out members of the Legion of Substitute Heroes with a single blow. His unusual way of thinking is also a great advantage and often allows him to guess opponents' tactics and outmaneuver them, humiliating them in the process.\n\nDespite all of this, Ambush Bug is simply a skinny man in the costume and can be defeated with surprising ease by more ridiculous characters. Serious foes, like Batman or Superman, have great difficulty dealing with him, but other lunatics can duel with him easily.\n\nIn the continuity of Amalgam Comics, Ambush the Lunatik is a combination of Ambush Bug and Marvel Comics's Lunatik, an equally insane character, also created by Giffen. An intergalactic bounty hunter, his sole appearance is in \"Lobo the Duck\" #1 (April 1997).\n\nIn \"\", a heavily armored Ambush Bug is a member of a version of the Justice Society of America backed by Lex Luthor and led by Wonder Woman.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the 2011 \"Flashpoint\" storyline, the \"Ambush Bugs\" are a group of insect-themed heroes gathered together to fight the Amazons. Their members are Queen Bee, Blue Beetle, Firefly, Cockroach, and Canterbury Cricket. All but the Canterbury Cricket are killed in a confrontation with the Amazons.\n\nAmbush Bug appears in the series finale of \"\" titled \"Mitefall!\", voiced by Henry Winkler. Here, he tries to thwart Bat-Mite's attempts to make the show jump the shark and force its cancellation while assisting Batman and Aquaman in fighting Gorilla Grodd. In the end, the executives do cancel the show. After Bat-Mite sees the trailer for the new Batman- uh,BatGIRL series, Ambush Bug appears next to Bat-Mite stating that because the upcoming series will be dark, Bat-Mite will not be in it. This causes this show's Bat-Mite to white out in the process. Ambush Bug helps organize a wrap party for the whole cast in the Bat Cave.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "948706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=948706", "title": "Beginning of the End (film)", "text": "Beginning of the End (film)\n\nBeginning of the End is a 1957 independently made American black-and-white science fiction giant insects film, produced and directed by Bert I. Gordon. It stars Peter Graves, Peggie Castle, and Morris Ankrum. The film's storyline concerns an agricultural scientist (Graves) who has successfully grown gigantic vegetables using radiation. Unfortunately, the vegetables are eaten by locusts (the swarming phase of short-horned grasshoppers), which quickly grow to a gigantic size and attack the nearby city of Chicago. \"Beginning of the End\" is generally known for its \"atrocious\" special effects and is considered to be one of the most poorly written and acted science fiction films of the 1950s.\n\nThe film opens with newspaper photojournalist Audrey Aimes (Castle) accidentally stumbling upon a small town (Ludlow, Illinois) which has been inexplicably destroyed. All 150 people in the town are missing, and the evidence indicates they are dead. Incredibly, the local fields are also barren, as if a swarm of locusts had eaten all the crops. Aimes suspects that the military is covering something up, and travels to a nearby United States Department of Agriculture experimental farm to learn what creature might have caused the agricultural destruction. She meets Dr. Ed Wainwright (Graves), who is experimenting with radiation as a means of growing gigantic fruits and vegetables to end world hunger. Dr. Wainwright reports that there have been a number of mysterious incidents nearby, and that locusts have eaten all the radioactive wheat stored in a nearby grain silo.\n\nGigantic mutant locusts rampage over the countryside. Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes begin to track down the source of the mysterious occurrences, and quickly discover that the locusts which ate the grain have grown to the size of a city bus. The monsters have eaten all the crops in the area, and now are seeking human beings as a means of sustenance. It is also clear that they are headed for the city of Chicago. Wainwright and Aimes meet with General Hanson (Ankrum), Colonel Sturgeon (Henry), and Captain Barton (Seay) to strategize a solution. Machine gun and artillery fire seem ineffective against the creatures, and there are far too many to effectively deal with all at once. The United States Army and Illinois National Guard are called upon to help protect the city. But the monsters quickly invade Chicago, and begin to feast on human flesh as well as several buildings.\n\nGeneral Hanson concludes that the only way to destroy the beasts \"en masse\" is to use a nuclear weapon and destroy Chicago. However, Dr. Wainwright realizes that the locusts are warm-weather creatures. He concludes that he might be able to lure the locusts into Lake Michigan. There, the cold water will incapacitate them, and they will drown. The lure itself will be a decoy locust mating call, generated electronically with test-tone oscillators. The plan is put into effect, and it works at the last possible moment. The monstrous locusts drown, but Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes wonder if other insects or animals might have eaten other radioactive crops. They ponder whether the whole world might be facing an attack of monstrous creatures.\n\n\nFilms with a science fiction theme were an uncommon but well-established genre of motion picture long before the 1950s. By one film historian's count, the \"modern\" era of science fiction film began in 1951 with the release of \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" and \"When Worlds Collide\". In 1952, \"King Kong\" was re-released theatrically. \"King Kong\" proved immensely popular, holding its own against new releases such as Cecil B. DeMille's \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (which later won the Academy Award for Best Picture). \"King Kong\" earned $2 million to $3 million (estimates vary) that year, roughly double the box office gross of its initial release and making the re-release very highly profitable for RKO Pictures. In response to the success of \"King Kong\", many film studios rushed science fiction-themed films into production. The following year saw the release of four highly influential motion pictures: \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\", \"It Came from Outer Space\", \"Invaders from Mars\", and \"The War of the Worlds\". The financial success of \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" (distributed by Warner Bros.) sparked an interest in giant monster films, and in 1954 Warner Bros. released another very profitable monster film, \"Them!\" With the success of these two films, giant insect pictures became a distinct subgenre of science fiction films in the 1950s.\n\n\"Beginning of the End\" was financed by American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres (AB-PT). The company had been formed in February 1953 when the American Broadcasting Company and United Paramount Theatres merged. In September 1956, AB-PT (sometimes also called \"Am-Par\") announced the formation of a movie studio, and revealed a slate of six films a year in January 1957. The studio's focus was on low-budget features which it could place in its theatres in the Northeast and South. AB-PT hoped to expand to a yearly slate of 20 pictures, and signed a distribution deal with Republic Pictures to get them into theatres.\n\n\"Beginning of the End\" went into production in 1956, the first of the \"boom years\" for science fiction films in the United States. Its production was a direct outcome of the success of \"Them!\"\n\nAB-PT announced on November 29, 1956, that it had approved production of its first film, \"Beginning of the End\" and announced on December 2, 1956, that production would begin immediately. The company said it had hired 34-year-old Bert I. Gordon to direct and produce. Gordon had gotten his start as a supervising producer for televised commercials and network TV shows, had produced his first feature film (\"Serpent Island\") in 1954, and directed his first feature film (\"King Dinosaur\") in 1955.\n\nThe story was already set, according to press reports, with \"Variety\" claiming that Bert I. Gordon had already completed the script. Press sources noted that the studio was clearly attempting to cash-in on the science fiction movie craze. However, the final screenplay is credited to Fred Frieberger (a veteran writer of B movies) and Lester Gorn. The screen story bears a striking resemblance to the 1904 H. G. Wells novel \"The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth\". (Gordon would adapt this novel twice more, once for Embassy Pictures in 1965's \"Village of the Giants\" and again for American International Pictures in 1976's \"The Food of the Gods\".)\n\nCasting was complete within two weeks of the start of production. In late November, AB-PT said actress Mala Powers was being considered for the female lead. But on December 2, the studio revealed that Peter Graves and Peggie Castle had been cast as the leads. Three days later, AB-PT announced that Don C. Harvey, Morris Ankrum, Pierre Watkin, Ralph Sanford, and Richard Benedict had also been cast. The studio also said that Pat Dean, its \"sexboat\" discovery (and a former dancer at the El Rancho Vegas hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada) would also appear in the picture. Larry Blake, Duane Cress, James Douglas, Eileen Jannsen, John Kranston, Ann Loos, and Jeanne Wood were added to the cast a few days later. Ankrum, Henry, and Seay were cast because they usually played military men in B movies, roles they portrayed in \"Beginning of the End\" as well.\n\nJohn A. Marta, a veteran cinematographer, and Aaron Stell, a long-time film editor, also worked on the film. Marta had shot close to 150 B movies for Republic Pictures by this time, which is probably why he was hired (given AB-PT's relationship with that studio and Marta's fast-and-quick shooting style). Albert Glasser composed the musical score. Glasser worked in the same office building where Gordon had his offices, and Gordon admired his score for the 1956 war film \"Huk!\" (a B movie from Pan Pacific Productions). Gordon had already used Glasser to score his 1957 monster movie \"The Cyclops\". Glasser wrote the musical score for \"Beginning of the End\" as well as five more of Gordon's films. Glasser was paid $4,000 for his work on \"The Cyclops\", which may indicate how much he was paid for the musical score for \"Beginning of the End.\" The musical soundtrack included the song \"Natural, Natural Baby.\" The art director was Walter Keller.\n\nIt is not clear what the budget for the picture was, although descriptions often use the term \"low budget\" or \"ultra-low-budget.\" According to a statement by AB-PT President Leonard Goldenson in 1957, the average cost of the AB-PT pictures greenlit to date was $300,000. In comparison, \"Invaders From Mars\" was budgeted at $150,000, \"The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms\" cost $400,000, \"It Came From Outer Space\" cost $532,000, \"Them!\" came in at under $1 million, and 1953's \"The War of the Worlds\" cost $2 million.\n\nFilming began December 3, 1956. Shooting took place on the Republic Pictures backlot at 4024 Radford Avenue in Los Angeles, California (built by Mack Sennett and now home to CBS Studio Center). Actor Peter Graves said Gordon \"was okay, he was a good director.\" He also had praise for actress Peggie Castle, and said he felt privileged to be working with an actor of Morris Ankrum's stature.\n\nGordon himself provided the special effects for the film. According to composer Glasser, Gordon literally worked out of his home garage. Animated grasshoppers were considered, but the idea rejected as too costly. So Gordon relied heavily on split screen, static mattes, and rear projection effects for the film. But his most important effort was one he had used in \"King Dinosaur\": placing live creatures on still photographs, and blowing air at them to encourage the creatures to move. Gordon purchased 200 non-hopping, non-flying live grasshoppers in Texas (which had recently seen an outbreak of a species of exceptionally large locusts) for the film. But when he attempted to bring them into California for filming, state agricultural officials required that every single one of the animals be inspected and sexed. He later described his efforts:\nGordon kept the grasshoppers in a box for only a few days, but during that time the grasshoppers devoured one another and only 12 were left when Gordon finally got around to shooting them. Gordon also considered building miniatures for the grasshoppers to climb on, but this, too, was deemed too expensive. Instead, Gordon used still photographs of the Wrigley Building and other noted Chicago landmarks and simply filmed the grasshoppers moving about on top of the photograph. When the monsters are supposed to be wounded or killed by gunfire, Gordon merely tipped the photograph and the grasshoppers slid down it. According to one film historian, \"the effect looks (almost) real\" until one of the grasshoppers steps off the \"building\" into what is supposed to be thin air.\n\n\"Beginning of the End\" premiered in Chicago on June 16, 1957. Stars Peter Graves and Peggie Castle were both on hand for the premiere. The film opened widely in 244 theaters in the South and Midwest on June 20. It played as part of a double feature with \"The Unearthly\" (a film based loosely on 1932's \"Island of Lost Souls\" and 1956's \"The Black Sleep\"), another AB-PT production. As planned, it was distributed by Republic Pictures. Two taglines were used to promote the film. The first was \"New Thrills! New Shocks! New Terror!\" This tagline is depicted on the film poster (see the infobox, above). The other tagline used was \"The screen's first full-length science-fiction feature with real-live creatures!\" There is some discrepancy as to how long the film ran. Some sources cite 73 minutes, some 74 minutes, and some 76 minutes.\n\nThe film was a modest hit, and profitable for AB-PT. For example, in its first week playing in San Francisco, California, it made $16,000—just behind the top-ranked movie of the week for the area, the reissue of \"Bambi\" (which grossed $18,500). The film's debut in Los Angeles saw its gross reach $16,500, although this was a soft movie-going market.\n\n\"Beginning of the End\" proved an apt title for its parent studio. AB-PT shuttered its operations immediately after releasing the film, for reasons which are still unclear. Gordon's work for AB-PT landed him a new contract with American International Pictures (AIP). The week \"Beginning of the End\" opened, Gordon began shooting his next feature film, \"The Amazing Colossal Man\", for AIP.\n\n\"Beginning of the End\" made Bert I. Gordon famous for his giant monster films. Critics and film historians point out that the film is only one of many which drew heavily on most Americans' fear about atomic weapons, open-air nuclear tests, and the possibility of nuclear war. However, \"Beginning of the End\" had very little of the metaphorical creativity of films such as \"Godzilla\" or \"Them!\" A more recent assessment, however, concludes that the film taps more deeply into 1950s Americans' worries over invasive species and growing unease over pesticides (like DDT).\n\nThe film received extensive negative reviews at the time of its release and by modern film historians. \"Variety\" was particularly negative. Calling the movie \"derivative\", the industry trade publication said, \"Summarizing the plot of \"Beginning of the End\" is like rehashing the story of several dozen similar films.\" The publication felt that not much effort had been put into the film. \"Even taken on its own terms—as a low-budget exploitation feature—\"Beginning of the End\" hardly reflects the best effort of a major theatre circuit.\" It called the special effects \"obvious\" and decried the use of stock footage. The reviewer felt the screenplay was \"ludicrous\" and cliché-ridden. The magazine believed Peter Graves had turned in a decent performance, but described Peggie Castle's performance as \"unconvincing\" and Morris Ankrum's as \"artificial\". The cinematography and editing were, it concluded, average. Mae Tinnee, reviewing the motion picture for the \"Chicago Tribune\" had several negative comments. \"The film obviously was made on a shoestring budget, and the people in it are no more than props for the magnified insects. I doubt if it will fool anyone. But youngsters will probably think it's great stuff.\" The \"Los Angeles Times\" was far harsher in its assessment. Its unsigned review concluded: \"The audience is cheated in the production. The conclusion is never in doubt and the process shots are so obvious that one is startled the first time a buffalo-sized grasshopper hits the screen but never again. And at no time are there more than a half-dozen of the things shown at once, although the script avers that there are thousands about and more coming.\" As of 2008, \"Beginning of the End\" is still \"one of the most excoriated creature features.\" Leonard Maltin summed up his review in one word: \"awful\". Another recent film guide called it \"Bottom-of-the-sci-fi-barrel rubbish, very boring to watch.\" One review pointed out that Gordon didn't even bother to hide the mountains in the background of the shots (Central Illinois is mostly flat prairie land). Some have also been upset with film's lack of horrifying images. The derivative nature of the picture has also upset some critics. Critics say the film covered almost the same ground as the far superior monster movie \"Them!\", and it is clear that Gordon merely wanted to \"cash in\" on giant bug craze rather than come up with a story that was fresh and creative.\n\nThere have been some positive reviews, however. One modern critic said \"the story is adequately paced, the acting is engaging, and we still get a thrill seeing the Army guys empty their cartridges at the unstoppable insects.\" Another modern reviewer found the screenplay effective, especially the beginning: \"As in \"Deadly Mantis\", the \"complete\" disappearance of the victims is especially chilling, as is the notion of 150 men, women and children being devoured overnight while in their beds. This aspect is like something out of Lovecraft, although it is not exploited as well as it could have been.\" Producer-director Bert I. Gordon said he did not care whether reviews were bad; what mattered was whether people went to see the film: \"The movie audience these days consists almost entirely of teenagers. Either they're naïve and go to get scared, or they're sophisticated and enjoy scoffing at the pictures. There isn't much a teenager can scoff at these days, you know.\" Lead actor Peter Graves also felt the film worked on a certain level. \"I think they played OK. ... All of that was ludicrous, but there were a certain amount of people who 'bought' it and loved it.\"\n\n\"Beginning of the End\" has become somewhat infamous because of its notoriously poor production values and unrealistic plot. The movie was parodied in the 11th season of the hit animated television program \"The Simpsons\" in the episode \"E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt).\" In that episode, Homer Simpson grows giant vegetables using radioactive materials, and automatically assumes that any animal eating the food will become monstrous. Homer even attempts to recall \"Beginning of the End\" as evidence of his claim, although he misremembers the title as \"Grasshopperus\" and the star as Chad Everett (another blond, all-American actor similar to Peter Graves).\n\n\"Beginning of the End\" was released on DVD in March 2003 by Image Entertainment. However, this print was considered \"smeary\" and not a very high quality issue.\n\nThe film was the basis of an episode of the cable television show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" (MST3K) during its fifth season. This episode of MST3K was released on DVD in 2001.\n\n\n"}

The Dorset culture (Inuktitut: \"Tuniit\" or \"Tunit\") refers to the next inhabitants of central and eastern Arctic. The Dorset culture evolved because of technological and economic changes during the period of 1050–550 BC.

{"id": "38440777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38440777", "title": "Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students", "text": "Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students\n\nThe Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students (CSFES) is a non-profit organization which Danielle Grijalva started in the United States of America in 2004. This committee was created to protect foreign children who could be abused both physically and mentally if not put into a safe home.\n\nGrijalva had worked as an area representative for CCI (Center for Cultural Interchange), a foreign-exchange program for student that is based in Illinois. As an area representative she had the task of ensuring the safe placement of exchange students travelling to the United States. As she gained experience as a representative, Ms. Grijalva learned that not all exchange students were placed with safe host-families.\n\nIn 2004, Danielle Grijalva resigned from CCI in protest when she found that another coordinator in the same agency had knowingly placed two boys from non-English speaking backgrounds in the home of a pederast who immediately began to groom them with gay pornography (which constitutes a crime in California), to provide them alcohol (which is against the law), and to deprive them of bathroom privacy. This was the eighth time that this man had been allowed to host boys.\n\nGrijalva was appalled when she found that her agency was totally disinterested in what had happened to the boys, but threatened her with a lawsuit if she continued her concerns. The agency then concocted the allegations that the boys were expelled from high school for downloading pornography from their host father's computer. The school principal contacted the Police Department and local Child Protective Services. Police, not the agency, removed the boys from the home. Their report claimed that when the officer went to the door, the man who answered stood there with his pants around his legs.\n\nWhen she expressed concerns about future students being placed in this man's home, the manager allegedly said, \"Now, Danielle, we cannot discriminate against homosexuality. Back off!\"\n\nThe president of the agency interfered with law enforcement stating that the boys concocted the allegations; because, they were accustomed to having a swimming pool in their back yard and wanted to be placed in a house that had one. The manager refused to change the placement and, hearing their allegations, notified police that the boys had attempted to steal from their host when they were caught looking for their passports and return tickets to go home. They, in common with most others in this situation, were instructed to sign a statement that the breakdown of the placement was due entirely to their own bad behavior, and they were told that they would be denied future access to the US if they refused to sign. This is sheer bullying; because, agencies do not have the power to prevent return visits. However, the boys did not know that they were being blackmailed and they signed. This of course prevents them from suing their abusers and the agencies.\n\nWhen in Grijalva wrote to inform the German agencies responsible for sending the boys to the US, she received an aggressive response. When she persisted and wrote again, she received a one-sentence reply: \"When we told you we didn't wish to hear from you, we meant it.\"\n\nGrijalva received so many complaints from parents and students that she set up a website which has attracted more and more horror stories. She established the International Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students (CSFES), enlisting the support of others who were aware of the problems. CSFES became a registered charity in 2007, by which time its filing cabinets were full of complaints from parents along with newspaper reports of exchange students raped, molested, and exposed to every type of extortion. CSFES has no power other than its ability to support parents and students, to publicise the actions of unscrupulous agencies using media, to lobby politicians and to lodge complaints with government and exchange agency officials who invariably blame students.\n\nCSFES maintains that every exchange student deserves a safe exchange experience. To ensure this, Ms. Grijalva tries to educate various government agencies, the exchange organizations themselves and potential host-families.\n\nUnfortunately, not all exchange students end up in safe host-families.

It is a sub-field of Pedagogy, opposed to Critical pedagogy (just as creative thinking for example in Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking is opposed to critical thinking). \"In its essence, creative pedagogy teaches learners how to learn creatively and become creators of themselves and creators of their future.\" \n\nCreative Pedagogy should be differentiated (disambiguated) from Creative Education that is usually associated with teaching creativity as a subject (see Creative Education Foundation). Creative Pedagogy, on the contrary, can be applied to ANY subject, whether it is Math, Science, Language, or Economics and Finance. To some extent, one can state that subject does not matter, methodology (type of pedagogy) does: that’s why the introduction of creative methodologies changes the process of teaching/learning.\n\nThe founder of Creative Pedagogy, Dr. Andrei Aleinikov, defined it in the form of formula of invention – a strict word pattern used to describe inventions for patenting in technology:\n\nThe concept of Creative Pedagogy got noticed and cited by numerous educators - see external links below. The authors of Encyclopedic Dictionary not only included an article on Creative Pedagogy, but also commented on its unusual form – the formula of invention.\n\nSee Pedagogy and Creativity\n\nThe goal of Creative Pedagogy is to transform ANY subject class (course, program, school) into a creative teaching process that would produce creative learners (life learners) – much more efficient learners than those produced by traditional school. This transformation of the traditional class (course, program, school) is called “creative orientation.” \n\nA typical objection to the introduction of Creative Pedagogy is the following, “Every pedagogy is creative.” Some obvious counter examples to the word “every” are the so-called rote learning or, for instance, teaching by physical punishment - both very far from creative pedagogy.\n\nDespite the slogans and inspiring practices of the great educators of the past like Jan Amos Komensky, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, Rudolf Steiner, Lev Vygotsky, Maria Montessori, Anton Makarenko, etc.), despite the wishes of parents and guardians, the type of pedagogy depends on the requirements of the society.\n\nCreative pedagogy states: \"Certain periods of history required certain pedagogies. History of education shows that the type of pedagogy usually depends on the needs of the society.\n\nAll these types of pedagogy can be dominant at a certain time, but they do exist and coexist in contemporary education as well. This century, however, has been many times called the century of creativity and innovation, so as society matures, there are more and more creative people, and the need in educating such people is becoming more vivid.\" \n\nThe emergence and growth of the Creative Class is a reality. That’s why there appeared Creative Pedagogy as pedagogy aiming at the upbringing of a creator (a creative person) capable of meeting the constantly growing complexity and accelerating development of the society.\n\nCreative Pedagogy generalized the research in the field of creativity (Graham Wallas, Alex Osborn, J.P. Guilford, Sid Parnes, Ellis Paul Torrance, etc.) and put it into the classroom to improve the teaching/learning process. Creative Pedagogy is the result of applying the studies of creative process to the education process itself.\n\nAs The Encyclopedia of Creativity article on Humane Creativity states, \"Creative Pedagogy, as a trend in science, generalizes and explains everything from music and art classes to creatively-oriented courses so thoroughly gathered and precisely described by Alex Osborn.\" Creative Pedagogy generalizes:\n\nThe next natural step after the creation of Creative Pedagogy was to check whether the theory and practice of creative teaching is teachable. Creative MetaPedagogy – the science and art of teaching teachers how to teach creatively appeared in 1990-1992.\n\nBy 2006, Creative Pedagogy and Creative MetaPedagogy in the form of numerous programs for teachers, managers, educational and business leaders, spread from the U.S.A. to Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, and Thailand. In Russia, where it was published first, it also received further development as \"collective creative pedagogy\" by I.P. Ivanov. A very interesting statement about the goal of creative pedagogy can be found in the work of TRIZ specialists B. Zlotin and A. Zusman, \"Creative pedagogy is an attempt to replace the battle between the teacher and students with the child's struggle for self-perfection. The teacher is the child's assistant and ally in this struggle.\" Creative pedagogy borrowed from TRIZ one of its most powerful methods - Ideal Final Result (IFR) to create the model of Ideal Education, Ideal Teacher and Ideal Learner. Progressive journals popularize and develop the ideas of creative pedagogy. Innovative schools, like Skolkovo School, Novosibirsk, Russia, build their new programs on creative pedagogy principles.\n\nThe term Creative Pedagogy becomes well spread - it is used for monograph titles and programs names. The concept is studied and taught at the university level (see further reading list). Finally, the new encyclopedia, dedicated entirely to creative pedagogy and titled Creative Pedagogy Encyclopedia is being produced under the leadership of V.V. Popov.\n\nThe recently published article \"Creative Pedagogy\" in the Encyclopedia of Creativity, Invention, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship, describes the principles, methodologies, and models of creative pedagogy mentioned above. It also graphically presents how creative pedagogy together with the neighboring concept of creative andragogy create the common area that can be named Creagogy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19159508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19159508", "title": "Culture", "text": "Culture\n\nCulture () is the social behavior and norms found in human societies. Culture is considered a central concept in anthropology, encompassing the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social learning in human societies. Cultural universals are found in all human societies; these include expressive forms like art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies like tool usage, cooking, shelter, and clothing. The concept of material culture covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of social organization (including practices of political organization and social institutions), mythology, philosophy, literature (both written and oral), and science comprise the intangible cultural heritage of a society.\n\nIn the humanities, one sense of culture as an attribute of the individual has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication in the arts, sciences, education, or manners. The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been seen to distinguish civilizations from less complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in class-based distinctions between a high culture of the social elite and a low culture, popular culture, or folk culture of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to cultural capital. In common parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the symbolic markers used by ethnic groups to distinguish themselves visibly from each other such as body modification, clothing or jewelry. Mass culture refers to the mass-produced and mass mediated forms of consumer culture that emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as Marxism and critical theory, have argued that culture is often used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate the lower classes and create a false consciousness, and such perspectives are common in the discipline of cultural studies. In the wider social sciences, the theoretical perspective of cultural materialism holds that human symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in evolved biological dispositions.\n\nWhen used as a count noun, a \"culture\" is the set of customs, traditions, and values of a society or community, such as an ethnic group or nation. Culture is the set of knowledge acquired over time. In this sense, multiculturalism values the peaceful coexistence and mutual respect between different cultures inhabiting the same planet. Sometimes \"culture\" is also used to describe specific practices within a subgroup of a society, a subculture (e.g. \"bro culture\"), or a counterculture. Within cultural anthropology, the ideology and analytical stance of cultural relativism holds that cultures cannot easily be objectively ranked or evaluated because any evaluation is necessarily situated within the value system of a given culture.\n\nThe modern term \"culture\" is based on a term used by the Ancient Roman orator Cicero in his \"Tusculanae Disputationes\", where he wrote of a cultivation of the soul or \"cultura animi,\" using an agricultural metaphor for the development of a philosophical soul, understood teleologically as the highest possible ideal for human development. Samuel Pufendorf took over this metaphor in a modern context, meaning something similar, but no longer assuming that philosophy was man's natural perfection. His use, and that of many writers after him, \"refers to all the ways in which human beings overcome their original barbarism, and through artifice, become fully human.\"\n\nIn 1986, philosopher Edward S. Casey wrote, \"The very word \"culture\" meant 'place tilled' in Middle English, and the same word goes back to Latin \"colere\", 'to inhabit, care for, till, worship' and \"cultus\", 'A cult, especially a religious one.' To be cultural, to have a culture, is to inhabit a place sufficiently intensive to cultivate it—to be responsible for it, to respond to it, to attend to it caringly.\"\n\nCulture described by Richard Velkley: ... originally meant the cultivation of the soul or mind, acquires most of its later modern meaning in the writings of the 18th-century German thinkers, who were on various levels developing Rousseau's criticism of \"modern liberalism and Enlightenment\". Thus a contrast between \"culture\" and \"civilization\" is usually implied in these authors, even when not expressed as such.\n\nIn the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\n\nThe \"Cambridge English Dictionary\" states that culture is \"the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time.\" Terror management theory posits that culture is a series of activities and worldviews that provide humans with the basis for perceiving themselves as \"person[s] of worth within the world of meaning\"—raising themselves above the merely physical aspects of existence, in order to deny the animal insignificance and death that \"Homo sapiens\" became aware of when they acquired a larger brain.\n\nThe word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent experiences with symbols and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability arose with the evolution of behavioral modernity in humans around 50,000 years ago, and is often thought to be unique to humans, although some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complex, abilities for social learning. It is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that is transmitted through social interaction and exist in specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form.\n\nIt has been estimated from archaeological data that the human capacity for cumulative culture emerged somewhere between 500,000–170,000 years ago.\n\nRaimon Panikkar identified 29 ways in which cultural change can be brought about, including growth, development, evolution, involution, renovation, reconception, reform, innovation, revivalism, revolution, mutation, progress, diffusion, osmosis, borrowing, eclecticism, syncretism, modernization, indigenization, and transformation. In this context, modernization could be viewed as adoption of Enlightenment era beliefs and practices, such as science, rationalism, industry, commerce, democracy, and the notion of progress. Rein Raud, building on the work of Umberto Eco, Pierre Bourdieu and Jeffrey C. Alexander, has proposed a model of cultural change based on claims and bids, which are judged by their cognitive adequacy and endorsed or not endorsed by the symbolic authority of the cultural community in question.\n\nCultural invention has come to mean any innovation that is new and found to be useful to a group of people and expressed in their behavior but which does not exist as a physical object. Humanity is in a global \"accelerating culture change period,\" driven by the expansion of international commerce, the mass media, and above all, the human population explosion, among other factors. Culture repositioning means the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.\nCultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. These forces are related to both social structures and natural events, and are involved in the perpetuation of cultural ideas and practices within current structures, which themselves are subject to change. (See structuration.)\n\nSocial conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes within a society by altering social dynamics and promoting new cultural models, and spurring or enabling generative action. These social shifts may accompany ideological shifts and other types of cultural change. For example, the U.S. feminist movement involved new practices that produced a shift in gender relations, altering both gender and economic structures. Environmental conditions may also enter as factors. For example, after tropical forests returned at the end of the last ice age, plants suitable for domestication were available, leading to the invention of agriculture, which in turn brought about many cultural innovations and shifts in social dynamics.\n\nCultures are externally affected via contact between societies, which may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in cultural practices. War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social dynamics. Additionally, cultural ideas may transfer from one society to another, through diffusion or acculturation. In diffusion, the form of something (though not necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to another. For example, hamburgers, fast food in the United States, seemed exotic when introduced into China. \"Stimulus diffusion\" (the sharing of ideas) refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another. \"Direct borrowing,\" on the other hand, tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another. Diffusion of innovations theory presents a research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new ideas, practices, and products.\n\nAcculturation has different meanings, but in this context it refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another, such as what happened to certain Native American tribes and to many indigenous peoples across the globe during the process of colonization. Related processes on an individual level include assimilation (adoption of a different culture by an individual) and transculturation. The transnational flow of culture has played a major role in merging different culture and sharing thoughts, ideas, and beliefs.\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724–1804) formulated an individualist definition of \"enlightenment\" similar to the concept of \"bildung\": \"Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity.\" He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant urged: \"Sapere aude\", \"Dare to be wise!\" In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. Moreover, Herder proposed a collective form of \"bildung\": \"For Herder, Bildung was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny, to a people.\"\nIn 1795, the Prussian linguist and philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835) called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. During the Romantic era, scholars in Germany, especially those concerned with nationalist movements—such as the nationalist struggle to create a \"Germany\" out of diverse principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the Austro-Hungarian Empire—developed a more inclusive notion of culture as \"worldview\" (\"Weltanschauung\"). According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups. Although more inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between \"civilized\" and \"primitive\" or \"tribal\" cultures.\n\nIn 1860, Adolf Bastian (1826–1905) argued for \"the psychic unity of mankind.\" He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of \"elementary ideas\" (\"Elementargedanken\"); different cultures, or different \"folk ideas\" (\"Völkergedanken\"), are local modifications of the elementary ideas. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture. Franz Boas (1858–1942) was trained in this tradition, and he brought it with him when he left Germany for the United States.\n\nIn the 19th century, humanists such as English poet and essayist Matthew Arnold (1822–1888) used the word \"culture\" to refer to an ideal of individual human refinement, of \"the best that has been thought and said in the world.\" This concept of culture is also comparable to the German concept of \"bildung\": \"...culture being a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world.\"\n\nIn practice, \"culture\" referred to an elite ideal and was associated with such activities as art, classical music, and haute cuisine. As these forms were associated with urban life, \"culture\" was identified with \"civilization\" (from lat. \"civitas\", city). Another facet of the Romantic movement was an interest in folklore, which led to identifying a \"culture\" among non-elites. This distinction is often characterized as that between high culture, namely that of the ruling social group, and low culture. In other words, the idea of \"culture\" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies.\n\nMatthew Arnold contrasted \"culture\" with anarchy; other Europeans, following philosophers Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, contrasted \"culture\" with \"the state of nature.\" According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the Native Americans who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between \"civilized\" and \"uncivilized.\" According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to Herbert Spencer's theory of Social Darwinism and Lewis Henry Morgan's theory of cultural evolution. Just as some critics have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is really an expression of the conflict between European elites and non-elites, other critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is really an expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their colonial subjects.\n\nOther 19th-century critics, following Rousseau, have accepted this differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the refinement and sophistication of high culture as corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people's essential nature. These critics considered folk music (as produced by \"the folk,\" i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. Equally, this view often portrayed indigenous peoples as \"noble savages\" living authentic and unblemished lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified capitalist systems of the West.\n\nIn 1870 the anthropologist Edward Tylor (1832–1917) applied these ideas of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the evolution of religion. According to this theory, religion evolves from more polytheistic to more monotheistic forms. In the process, he redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all human societies. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.\n\nAlthough anthropologists worldwide refer to Tylor's definition of culture, in the 20th century \"culture\" emerged as the central and unifying concept of American anthropology, where it most commonly refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human experiences symbolically, and to communicate symbolically encoded experiences socially. American anthropology is organized into four fields, each of which plays an important role in research on culture: biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, cultural anthropology, and in the United States, archaeology. The term \"Kulturbrille\", or \"culture glasses,\" coined by German American anthropologist Franz Boas, refers to the \"lenses\" through which we see our own countries. Martin Lindstrom asserts that \"Kulturbrille\", which allow us to make sense of the culture we inhabit, also \"can blind us to things outsiders pick up immediately.\"\n\nThe sociology of culture concerns culture as manifested in society. For sociologist Georg Simmel (1858–1918), culture referred to \"the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history.\" As such, culture in the sociological field can be defined as the ways of thinking, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's way of life. Culture can be any of two types, non-material culture or material culture. Non-material culture refers to the non-physical ideas that individuals have about their culture, including values, belief systems, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations, and institutions, while material culture is the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make or have made. The term tends to be relevant only in archeological and anthropological studies, but it specifically means all material evidence which can be attributed to culture, past or present.\n\nCultural sociology first emerged in Weimar Germany (1918–1933), where sociologists such as Alfred Weber used the term \"Kultursoziologie\" (cultural sociology). Cultural sociology was then \"reinvented\" in the English-speaking world as a product of the \"cultural turn\" of the 1960s, which ushered in structuralist and postmodern approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may be loosely regarded as an approach incorporating cultural analysis and critical theory. Cultural sociologists tend to reject scientific methods, instead hermeneutically focusing on words, artifacts and symbols. \"Culture\" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including resolutely scientific fields like social stratification and social network analysis. As a result, there has been a recent influx of quantitative sociologists to the field. Thus, there is now a growing group of sociologists of culture who are, confusingly, not cultural sociologists. These scholars reject the abstracted postmodern aspects of cultural sociology, and instead look for a theoretical backing in the more scientific vein of social psychology and cognitive science. \n\nThe sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology (as shaped by early theorists like Marx, Durkheim, and Weber) with the growing discipline of anthropology, wherein researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. Part of the legacy of the early development of the field lingers in the methods (much of cultural sociological research is qualitative), in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities), and in the substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between popular culture, political control, and social class were early and lasting concerns in the field.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, sociologists and other scholars influenced by Marxism such as Stuart Hall (1932–2014) and Raymond Williams (1921–1988) developed cultural studies. Following nineteenth-century Romantics, they identified \"culture\" with consumption goods and leisure activities (such as art, music, film, food, sports, and clothing). They saw patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by relations of production, which led them to focus on class relations and the organization of production.\n\nIn the United States, cultural studies focuses largely on the study of popular culture; that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods. Richard Hoggart coined the term in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies or CCCS. It has since become strongly associated with Stuart Hall, who succeeded Hoggart as Director. Cultural studies in this sense, then, can be viewed as a limited concentration scoped on the intricacies of consumerism, which belongs to a wider culture sometimes referred to as \"Western civilization\" or \"globalism.\"\n\nFrom the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed, it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies, and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender. Cultural studies is concerned with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. It also studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to \"fit in\" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice.\n\nIn the context of cultural studies, the idea of a \"text\" includes not only written language, but also films, photographs, fashion or hairstyles: the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture. Similarly, the discipline widens the concept of \"culture.\" \"Culture\" for a cultural-studies researcher not only includes traditional high culture (the culture of ruling social groups) and popular culture, but also everyday meanings and practices. The last two, in fact, have become the main focus of cultural studies. A further and recent approach is comparative cultural studies, based on the disciplines of comparative literature and cultural studies.\n\nScholars in the United Kingdom and the United States developed somewhat different versions of cultural studies after the late 1970s. The British version of cultural studies had originated in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly under the influence of Richard Hoggart, E.P. Thompson, and Raymond Williams, and later that of Stuart Hall and others at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham. This included overtly political, left-wing views, and criticisms of popular culture as \"capitalist\" mass culture; it absorbed some of the ideas of the Frankfurt School critique of the \"culture industry\" (i.e. mass culture). This emerges in the writings of early British cultural-studies scholars and their influences: see the work of (for example) Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, and Paul Gilroy.\n\nIn the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, \"Cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition.\" The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of, mass culture; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of fandom. The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded. Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a Marxist model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the Frankfurt School, but especially from the structuralist Marxism of Louis Althusser and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the \"production\" of meaning. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies power as residing with those producing cultural artifacts. In a Marxist view, those who control the means of production (the economic \"base\") essentially control a culture. Other approaches to cultural studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book \"Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman\" (by Paul du Gay \"et al.\"), which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist, and art historian Griselda Pollock contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of art history and psychoanalysis. The writer Julia Kristeva is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical French feminism.\n\nPetrakis and Kostis (2013) divide cultural background variables into two main groups:\n\nIn 2016, a new approach to culture was suggested by Rein Raud, who defines culture as the sum of resources available to human beings for making sense of their world and proposes a two-tiered approach, combining the study of texts (all reified meanings in circulation) and cultural practices (all repeatable actions that involve the production, dissemination or transmission of meanings), thus making it possible to re-link anthropological and sociological study of culture with the tradition of textual theory.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5937693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5937693", "title": "Culture of Palestine", "text": "Culture of Palestine\n\nThe \nCulture of Palestine is the culture of the Palestinian people, located across Historic Palestine as well as in the Palestinian diaspora. Palestinian culture is influenced by the many diverse cultures and religions which have existed in historic Palestine, from the early Canaanite period onward. Cultural contributions to the fields of art, literature, music, costume and cuisine express the Palestinian identity despite the geographical separation between the Palestinian territories, Palestinian citizens and the diaspora.\n\nPalestinian culture consists of food, dance, legends, oral history, proverbs, jokes, popular beliefs, customs, and comprising the traditions (including oral traditions) of Palestinian culture. The folklorist revival among Palestinian intellectuals such as Nimr Sirhan, Musa Allush, Salim Mubayyid, and the emphasized pre-Islamic (and pre-Hebraic) cultural roots, re-constructing Palestinian identity with a focus on Canaanite and Jebusite cultures. Such efforts seem to have borne fruit as evidenced in the organization of celebrations like the Qabatiya Canaanite festival and the annual Music Festival of Yabus by the Palestinian Ministry of Culture.\n\nForeign travelers to Palestine in late 19th and early 20th centuries often commented on the rich variety of costumes among the Palestinian people, and particularly among the fellaheen or village women. Until the 1940s, a woman's economic status, whether married or single, and the town or area they were from could be deciphered by most Palestinian women by the type of cloth, colors, cut, and embroidery motifs, or lack thereof, used for the robe-like dress or \"thoub\" in Arabic.\n\nThe 1948 Palestinian exodus led to a disruption in traditional modes of dress and customs, as many women who had been displaced could no longer afford the time or money to invest in complex embroidered garments. New styles began to appear the 1960s. For example, the \"six-branched dress\" named after the six wide bands of embroidery running down from the waist. These styles came from the refugee camps, particularly after 1967. Individual village styles were lost and replaced by an identifiable \"Palestinian\" style. The shawal, a style popular in the West Bank and Jordan before the First Intifada, probably evolved from one of the many welfare embroidery projects in the refugee camps. It was a shorter and narrower fashion, with a western cut.\n\nDabke ( , is an Arab folk dance native to the Levant countries. It is popular in Palestinian culture, and many troupes perform the dance throughout the world. The Dabke is marked by synchronized jumping, stamping, and movement, similar to tap dancing.\n\nTraditional storytelling among Palestinians is prefaced with an invitation to the listeners to give blessings to God and the Prophet Mohammed or the Virgin Mary as the case may be, and includes the traditional opening: \"There was, in the oldness of time ...\" Formulaic elements of the stories share much in common with the wider Arab world, though the rhyming scheme is distinct. There are a cast of supernatural characters: Jinss and Djinns who can cross the Seven Seas in an instant, giants, and ghouls with eyes of ember and teeth of brass.\n\nTraditional Palestinian songs have no set lyrics but rather a set rhythm to them, allowing for improvised folk poetry lyrics. A form of this style of folk singing is Ataaba; it consists of 4 verses, following a specific form and meter. The distinguishing feature of ataaba is that the first three verses end with the same word meaning three different things, and the fourth verse serves as a conclusion. The Ataaba continues to be performed at weddings and festivals in Arab localities in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza strip. \n\nOther traditional Palestinian song styles include \"zajal\", \"Bein Al-dawai\", \"Al-Rozana\", \"Zarif – Al-Toul\", \"Al-Maijana\", \"Sahja/Saamir\" and \"Zaghareed\".\n\nOver three decades, the Palestinian National Music and Dance Troupe (El Funoun) and Mohsen Subhi have reinterpreted and rearranged traditional wedding songs such as \"Mish'al\" (1986), \"Marj Ibn 'Amer\"(1989) and \"Zaghareed\" (1997).\n\nTraditional Palestinian architecture covers a vast historical time frame and a number of different styles and influences over the ages. The urban architecture of Palestine prior to 1850 was relatively sophisticated. While it belonged to greater geographical and cultural context of the Levant and the Arab world, it constituted a distinct tradition, \"significantly different from the traditions of Syria, Lebanon or Egypt.\" Nonetheless, the Palestinian townhouse shared in the same basic conceptions regarding the arrangement of living space and apartment types commonly seen throughout the Eastern Mediterranean. The rich diversity and underlying unity of the architectural culture of this wider region stretching from the Balkans to North Africa was a function of the exchange fostered by the caravans of the trade routes, and the extension of Ottoman rule over most of this area, beginning in the early 16th century through until the end of World War I.\n\nPalestinian athletes have competed at every Olympic Games since the 1996 Summer Olympics. The Palestinian Olympic committee did not work with the Israeli Olympic committee to train for the 2012 Olympic games, and participation in the 2013 Mediterranean Games.\nThere is a West Bank Premier League, and Gaza Strip League. The Palestine national football team played Afghanistan in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. They visited Australia for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.\n\nThe Beit Jala Lions is a West Bank Rugby Union team.\n\nThe Turmus Aya Equestrian Club, established in 2007, is a riding club dedicated to the mission of providing affordable access to horses for Palestinians. Ashraf Rabi, the founder, maintains that \"this is part of the development of Palestine. Horses are a big part of our Arab culture and we must embrace it.\" \n\nSimilar to the structure of Palestinian society, the Palestinian field of arts extends over four main geographic centers:\n\n\nContemporary Palestinian art finds its roots in folk art and traditional Christian and Islamic painting. After the 1948 Palestinian exodus, nationalistic themes have predominated as Palestinian artists use diverse media to express and explore their connection to identity and land. In the 1990s Salam Dyab, Hisham Zreiq, Issa Dibe and others began to adopt modern styles and symbolism.\n\nPalestine's history of rule by many different empires is reflected in Palestinian cuisine, which has benefited from various cultural contributions and exchanges. Generally speaking, modern Palestinian dishes have been influenced by the rule of three major Islamic groups: the Arabs, the Persian-influenced Arabs, and the Turks. The original Bedouin Arabs in Syria and Palestine had simple culinary traditions primarily based on the use of rice, lamb and yogurt, as well as dates.\n\nThe cuisine of the Ottoman Empire, which incorporated Palestine as one of its provinces between 1512 and 1514, was partially made up of what had become by then a rich Arab cuisine. After the Crimean War, many foreign communities (namely the Bosnians, Greeks, French and Italians) began settling in the area; Jerusalem, Jaffa and Bethlehem were the most popular destinations for these groups. The cuisine of these communities, particularly those of the Balkans, contributed to the character of Palestinian cuisine. Nonetheless, until the 1950s and 1960s, the staple diet for many rural Palestinian families revolved around olive oil, oregano (\"za'atar\") and bread, baked in a simple oven called a taboon.\n\nPalestinian cuisine is divided into three regional groups: the Galilee, West Bank and Gaza area. Cuisine in the Galilee region shares much in common with Lebanese cuisine, due to extensive communication between the two regions before the establishment of Israel. Galilee inhabitants specialize in producing a number of meals based on the combination of bulgur, spices and meat, known as \"kibbee\" by Arabs. \"Kibbee\" has several variations including it being served raw, fried or baked. \"Musakhan\" is a common main dish that originated in the Jenin and Tulkarm areas of the northern West Bank. It consists of a roasted chicken over a taboon bread that has been topped with pieces of fried sweet onions, sumac, allspice and pine nuts, cooked and finished with a generous helping of olive oil. Other meals common to the area are \"maqluba\" and \"mansaf\", the latter originating from the Bedouin population of Jordan.\n\nThe cuisine of the Gaza Strip is influenced both by neighboring Egypt and its location on the Mediterranean coast. The staple food for the majority of the inhabitants in the area is fish. Gaza has a major fishing industry and fish is often served either grilled or fried after being stuffed with cilantro, garlic, red peppers, cumin, and then marinated in a mix of coriander, red peppers, cumin, and chopped lemons. The Egyptian culinary influence is also seen by the frequent use of hot peppers, garlic and chard to flavor many of Gaza's meals. A dish native to the Gaza area is \"Sumaghiyyeh\", which consists of water-soaked ground sumac mixed with tahina, which is then added to sliced chard, pieces of stewed beef, and garbanzo beans.\n\nThere are several foods native to Palestine that are well known in the Arab world, such as, \"kinafe Nabulsi\", Nabulsi cheese (cheese of Nablus), Ackawi cheese (cheese of Acre), Rumaniyya (from Jaffa), Sumaghiyyeh (a stew from Gaza) and Musakhan. \"Kinafe\" originated in Nablus, as well as the sweetened \"Nabulsi\" cheese used to fill it. Baqlawa, a pastry introduced at the time of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, is also an integral part of Palestinian cuisine.\n\nChick-pea based falafel, which substituted for the fava beans used in the original Egyptian recipe, and added Indian peppers, introduced after the Mongol invasions opened new trade routes, are a favorite staple in Mediterranean cuisine.\n\nEntrées that are eaten throughout the Palestinian Territories include \"waraq al-'inib,\" boiled grape leaves wrapped around cooked rice and ground lamb. \"Mahashi\" is an assortment of stuffed vegetables such as zucchinis, potatoes, cabbage and, in Gaza, chard.\n\nPalestinian cinema is relatively young compared to Arab cinema overall and many Palestinian movies are made with European and Israeli support. Palestinian films are not exclusively produced in Arabic; some are made in English, French or Hebrew. More than 800 films have been produced about Palestinians, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and other related topics; notable examples are \"Divine Intervention\" and \"Paradise Now\".\n\nA wide variety of handicrafts, many of which have been produced by Palestinians for hundreds of years, continue to be produced today. Palestinian handicrafts include embroidery and weaving, pottery-making, soap-making, glass-making, and olive wood and Mother of Pearl carvings\n\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, Palestinian intellectuals were integral parts of wider Arab intellectual circles, as represented by individuals such as May Ziade and Khalil Beidas. Educational levels among Palestinians have traditionally been high. In the 1960s, the West Bank had a higher percentage of its adolescent (15 to 17 years of age) population enrolled in high school than Israel; the West Bank had a 44.6% high school enrollment rate versus a 22.8% enrollment rate in Israel. Claude Cheysson, France’s Minister for Foreign Affairs under the first Mitterrand Presidency, held in the mid eighties that \"even thirty years ago, [Palestinians] probably already had the largest educated elite of all the Arab peoples.\"\n\nDiaspora figures like Edward Said and Ghada Karmi, Arab citizens of Israel like Emile Habibi, and Jordanians like Ibrahim Nasrallah have made contributions to a wide number of fields, exemplifying the diversity of experience and thought among Palestinians.\n\nThe long history of the Arabic language and its rich written and oral tradition form part of the Palestinian literary tradition as it has developed over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nSince 1967, most critics have theorized the existence of three \"branches\" of Palestinian literature, loosely divided by geographic location: 1) from inside Israel, 2) from the occupied territories, 3) from among the Palestinian diaspora throughout the Middle East.\n\nPoetry, using classical pre-Islamic forms, remains an extremely popular art form, often attracting Palestinian audiences in the thousands. Until 20 years ago, local folk bards reciting traditional verses were a feature of every Palestinian town. After the 1948 Palestinian exodus, poetry was transformed into a vehicle for political activism. From among those Palestinians who became Arab citizens of Israel after the passage of the Citizenship Law in 1952, a school of resistance poetry was born that included poets like Mahmoud Darwish, Samih al-Qasim, and Tawfiq Zayyad. The work of these poets was largely unknown to the wider Arab world for years because of the lack of diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab governments. This changed after Ghassan Kanafani, another Palestinian writer in exile in Lebanon, published an anthology of their work in 1966. Palestinian poets often write about a sense of loss and existence in the diaspora.\n\nPalestinian music is well known throughout the Arab world. It reflects the Palestinian experience, dealing with themes such as the struggle with Israel, the longing for peace, and the love of the land of Palestine. A new wave of performers emerged with distinctively Palestinian themes following the 1948 Palestinian exodus, relating to the dreams of statehood and the burgeoning nationalist sentiments. \n\nSince the 1990s the subgenre of Palestinian hip hop has blended the traditional folk music elements of Palestinian music and Arabic melodies with hip hop beats. These artists see themselves as joining a “longer tradition of revolutionary, underground, Arabic music and political songs that have supported Palestinian Resistance”, \"[tailoring] the style to express their own grievances with the social and political climate in which they live and work\".\n"}

Rudolf Bultmann (1884-1976) introduced the term \"demythologization\" (in German: \"Entmythologisierung\") in this context,\nbut the concept has earlier precedents.\n\nIn his 1677 \"Theologico-Political Treatise\", Spinoza argues that any event in Scripture which is inconsistent with natural laws must be interpreted either as unreliable testimony or as a metaphorical or allegorical representation of a moral teaching. Because the masses are \"wholly ignorant of the workings of nature\", they are prone to interpret any natural event they can't explain as a miracle, and this \"ridiculous way of expressing ignorance\" often finds its way into Scripture. Scripture aims not at narrating things in terms of their natural causes, but rather at exciting the \"popular imagination\" in order to \"impress the minds of the masses with devotion.\"Therefore it speaks inaccurately of God and of events, seeing that its object is not to convince the reason, but to attract and lay hold of the imagination. If the Bible were to describe the destruction of an empire in the style of political historians, the masses would remain unstirred.In order to correctly interpret scripture we must understand the opinions and judgments of the ancients and learn common \"Jewish phrases and metaphors.\" Otherwise we will be prone to \"confound actual events with symbolical and imaginary ones.\"Many things are narrated in Scripture as real, and were believed to be real, which were in fact only symbolical and imaginary.\n\nImmanuel Kant's 1793 \"Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone\" argues that the New Testament teaches a hermeneutic strategy in which \"not scriptural scholarship but the pure religion of reason must be the law's interpreter.\"[Jesus] claims that not the observance of outer civil or statutory churchly duties but the pure moral disposition of the heart alone can make man well-pleasing to God (Mt 5:20-48); … that injury done one’s neighbor can be repaired only through satisfaction rendered to the neighbor himself, not through acts of divine worship (Mt 5:24). Thus, he says, does he intend to do full justice to the Jewish law (Mt 5:17); whence it is obvious that not scriptural scholarship but the pure religion of reason must be the law’s interpreter, for taken according to the letter, it allowed the very opposite of all this.Kant understood the Pharisees to have interpreted the Old Testament as a statutory religion, and he claims that the New Testament intends to replace statutory religion with a \"moral religion,\" which combines all duties into a single universal rule, \"Love thy neighbor as thyself.\"Whatever, over and above good life-conduct, man fancies that he can do to become well-pleasing to God is mere religious delusion.Such delusions, Kant argues, must be abandoned to fulfill the New Testament's demand for a rational religion.\n\nThe German theologian Rudolf Bultmann argues in his 1941 \"New Testament and Mythology\" that it is no longer plausible to demand that Christians accept the \"mythical world picture\" of the New Testament.We cannot use electric lights and radios and, in the event of illness, avail ourselves of modern medical and clinical means and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament.To interpret New Testament mythology in cosmological terms, as a description of the universe, is not plausible. This interpretation must be superseded by an anthropological interpretation that \"discloses the truth of the kerygma as kerygma for those who do not think mythologically.\"Can the Christian proclamation today expect men and women to acknowledge the mythical world picture as true? To do so would be both pointless and impossible. It would be pointless because there is nothing specifically Christian about the mythical world picture, which is simply the world picture of a time now past which was not yet formed by scientific thinking. It would be impossible because no one can appropriate a world picture by sheer resolve, since it is already given with one’s historical situation.\n\n"}

{"id": "26209432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26209432", "title": "Filipino values", "text": "Filipino values\n\nThe Filipino value system or Filipino values refers to the set of values or the value system that a majority of the Filipino have historically held important in their lives. This Philippine values system includes their own unique assemblage of consistent ideologies, moral codes, ethical practices, etiquette and cultural and personal values that are promoted by their society. As with any society though, the values that an individual holds sacred can differ on the basis of religion, upbringing and other factors.\n\nAs a general description, the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly Christianity) and commercial relationships.\n\nFilipino values are, for the most part, centered at maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group. The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of \"\"Hiya\", roughly translated as 'a sense of shame', and \"Amor propio\"\" or 'self-esteem'. Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns. Caring about what others will think, say or do, are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos.\n\nAccording to the anthropologist Leonardo Mercado, the Filipino worldview is basically 'nondualistic'. Based on his linguistic analyses of Filipino value terms like \"loob\" (Cebuano \"buot\"), he concludes that Filipinos desire harmony, not only in interpersonal relationships, but also with nature and religion, while still remaining nondichotomous.\n\nFlorentino Timbreza, a cultural philosopher, concludes in his book \"Pilosopiyang Pilipino\" (1982) that Filipino values are based on the significance of the world to man. Life experiences dictate the philosophy of the Filipino, augmented by other sources like proverbs, folk sayings, folk tales, and the like.\n\nF. Landa Jocano identified two models of the Filipino value system. The first is the exogenous model or the foreign model, while the second is the indigenous model or the traditional model. The foreign model is described to be a \"legal and formal\" model. The indigenous model is described as a \"traditional and non-formal\" model or guide but is deeply embedded in the subconscious of the Filipinos.\n\nThe foreign model was inherited by Filipinos from Western cultures, particularly from the Spaniards and the Americans. An example of a foreign or exogenous influence is bureaucracy exhibited in the government of the Philippines.\n\nBased on studies, surveys, opinions, anecdotes, and other literatures made by experts and researchers in relation to Filipino social values or Filipino core values, along with the Filipino character or Filipino identity of a person or an individual known as the Filipino, the Filipino value system are found to possess inherent key elements.\n\nOne can note how \"Hiya\" (propriety/dignity)\", Pakikisama\"(companionship/esteem)\",\" and \"Utang na loob\"(gratitude/solidarity), are merely Surface Values—readily seen and observed values exhibited and esteemed by many Filipinos. These three values are considered branches from a single origin—the actual Core Value of the Filipino Personality—\"Kapwa\". It means 'togetherness', and refers to community, or not doing things alone. \"Kapwa\" has two categories, \"Ibang Tao\" (other people) and \"Hindi Ibang Tao\" (not other people). The Surface Values spin off of the Core Value through the Pivotal Aspect of \"Pakikiramdam,\" or shared inner perception (\"Feeling for another\").\n\nOther notable key elements or motivations are optimism about the future, pessimism with regards to present situations and events, the concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery.\n\nThe values of Filipinos specifically upholds the following items: solidarity of the family unit, security of the Philippine economy, orientation to small-groups, personalism, the concepts of \"\"loob\" or \"kalooban\"\" (meaning \"what’s inside the self\", the \"inner-self\", or the \"actual personal feelings of the self\"), existence and maintenance of smooth interpersonal relationships, and the sensing of the feelings or needs of others (known as \"pakikiramdam\"). In a larger picture, these values are grouped into general clusters or \"macroclusters\": namely, the relationship cluster, the social cluster, the livelihood cluster, the inwardness cluster, and the optimism cluster.\n\nThis is the shared sense of identity and consciousness of the 'other'. It means treating others with respect and dignity as an equal, not someone below the individual.\n\nThe basic and most important unit of a Filipino's life is the family. Unlike in Western countries, young Filipinos who turn 18 are not expected to move out of their parents' home. When a Filipino's parents are old and cannot take care of themselves, they are cared for in their children's homes and are very rarely brought by their children to Homes for the Aged. The practice of separating the elderly from the rest of the family, while common in Western countries, is often looked down upon in Filipino society. Family lunches with the whole clan with up to 50 people, extending until the line of second cousins, are not unusual. The Filipino puts a great emphasis on the value of family and being close to one's family members.\n\nThis famous trait is the ability of Filipinos to find humour in everything. It sheds light on the optimism and positivity of Filipinos in whatever situation they are in so as to remain determined in going through struggles or challenges. It serves as a coping technique, the same way a child who has fallen laughs at himself/herself to hide his/her embarrassment.\n\nStudies show that Filipinos often have an aversion to a set of standardised rules or procedures; They are known to follow a \"natural clock\" or organic sense of time—doing things in the time they feel is right. They are present-oriented: which means that one attends to a task or requirement at the time it is needed and does not worry much about future engagements. This allows the Filipino to adapt and be flexible in doing the tasks at times not bound to a particular schedule or timeframe. This allows them think on their feet and be creative in facing whatever challenge or task they have even when it is already right in front of them.\n\nThe Philippines is approximately 85 percent Christians (mostly Roman Catholics ), 10 percent Muslim, and 5 percent 'other' religions, including the Taoist-Buddhist religious beliefs of Chinese and the 'indigenous' animistic beliefs of some peoples in upland areas that resisted 300 years of Spanish colonial rule. This is a reflection of the Filipinos' strong faith in God as seen in their various practices. This includes the numerous church holidays they observe, the customary (and obligatory) Sunday Mass, the individual's basis of their moral standpoints, the influence of the Church on the minds, actions, and opinions of the majority, importance of the Sacraments, praying at almost any possible time of the day, the extreme practices during Holy Week,\n\nThe Filipinos as a people who have been constantly under the rule of numerous powerful countries has over time, developed a sense of resourcefulness or the ability to survive with whatever they have. They have the extraordinary ability to make something out of almost nothing. If a Filipino was given just a screwdriver, plastic bagseut, and some tape, he would still be able to build a bird tree, especially for the sake of survival, and provided that he be allowed to hunt for some needed surrounding material.\n\nWith resourcefulness comes hard work. Filipinos are very determined and persevering in accomplishing whatever they set their minds to. Filipinos over the years have proven time and time again that they are a people with an industrious attitude. Sadly, this is seen by others as Filipinos being only useful as domestic helpers, working abroad to help their families in the country. This is also present in the country’s workforce particularly the farmers. Even with little support, technological weaknesses and the country’s seasonal typhoons, the Filipino farmer still strives to earn their daily meal.\n\nForeigners who come to visit the Philippines speak of Filipinos going out of their way to help them when lost, or the heartwarming generosity of a Filipino family hosting a visitor in their poverty-stricken home. Meanwhile, most foreigners who attend Filipino gatherings abroad (which are frequently organized for hundreds of reasons) testify to the warmth and friendliness of Filipinos as they experience that feeling of “belongingness.” Indeed, the legendary Filipino hospitality is not limited to the Philippines. It is everywhere wherever there are Filipinos.\n\nIn relation to parenthood, bearing male and female children depends on the preferences of the parents based on the expected roles that each gender would assume once grown up. Both genders are expected to become responsible members of the family and their society. Women in the Philippines are expected to become caring and nurturing mothers for their own children.\n\nFemale Filipinos are also expected to lend a hand in household work. They are even anticipated to offer assistance after being married. On the other hand, Filipino men are expected to assume the role of becoming the primary source of income and financial support of his family.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n"}
{"id": "14520306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14520306", "title": "Gender inequality", "text": "Gender inequality\n\nGender inequality is the idea and situation that men and women are not equal. Gender inequality refers to unequal treatment or perceptions of individuals wholly or partly due to their gender. It arises from differences in gender roles. Gender systems are often dichotomous and hierarchical. Gender inequality stems from distinctions, whether empirically grounded or socially constructed. Women lag behind men in many domains, including education, labor market opportunities and political representation and in pay.\n\nNatural differences exist between the sexes base on biological and anatomic factors, most notably differing reproductive roles. Biological differences include chromosomes and hormonal differences. There is a natural difference also in the relative physical strengths (on average) of the sexes, both in the lower body and more pronouncedly in the upper-body, though this does not mean that any given man is stronger than any given woman. Men, on average, are taller, which provides both advantages and disadvantages. Women live significantly longer than men, though it is not clear to what extent this is a biological difference - see Life expectancy. Men have larger lung volumes and more circulating blood cells and clotting factors, while women have more circulating white blood cells and produce antibodies faster. Differences such as these are hypothesized to be an adaption allowing for sexual specialization.\n\nPrenatal hormone exposure influences to what extent one exhibits traditional masculine or feminine behavior. No differences between males and females exist in general intelligence. Men are significantly more likely to take risks than women. Men are also more likely than women to be aggressive, a trait influenced by prenatal and possibly current androgen exposure. It has been theorized that these differences combined with physical differences are an adaption representing sexual division of labor. A second theory proposes sex differences in intergroup aggression represent adaptions in male aggression to allow for territory, resource and mate acquisition. Females are (on average) more empathetic than males, though this does not mean that any given woman is more empathetic than any given man. Men and women have better visuospatial and verbal memory, respectively. These changes are influenced by the male sex hormone testosterone, which increases visuospatial memory in both genders when administered.\n\nFrom birth males and females are raised differently and experience different environments throughout their lives. In the eyes of society, gender has a huge role to play in many major milestones or characteristics in life; like personality. Males and females are lead on different paths before they are able to choose their own. The colour blue is most commonly associated with boys and they get toys like monster trucks or more sport related things to play with from the time that they are babies. Girls are more commonly introduced to the colour pink, dolls, dresses, and playing house where they are taking care of the dolls as if they were children. The norm of blue is for boys and pink is for girls is cultural and has not always historically been around. These paths set by parents or other adult figures in the child's life set them on certain paths. This leads to a difference in personality, career paths, or relationships. Throughout life males and females are seen as two very different species who have very different personalities and should stay on separate paths.\n\nThe gender pay gap is the average difference between men's and women's aggregate wages or salaries. The gap is due to a variety of factors, including differences in education choices, differences in preferred job and industry, differences in the types of positions held by men and women, differences in the type of jobs men typically go into as opposed to women (especially highly paid high risk jobs), differences in amount of work experiences, difference in length of the work week, and breaks in employment. These factors resolve 60% to 75% of the pay gap, depending on the source. Various explanations for the remaining 25% to 40% have been suggested, including women's lower willingness and ability to negotiate salary and sexual discrimination. According to the European Commission direct discrimination only explains a small part of gender wage differences.\n\nIn the United States, the \"average\" female's \"unadjusted\" annual salary has been cited as 78% of that of the \"average\" male. However, multiple studies from OECD, AAUW, and the US Department of Labor have found that pay rates between males and females varied by 5–6.6% or, females earning 94 cents to every dollar earned by their male counterparts, when wages were adjusted to different individual choices made by male and female workers in college major, occupation, working hours, and maternal/parental leave. The remaining 6% of the gap has been speculated to originate from deficiency in salary negotiating skills and sexual discrimination.\n\nHuman capital theories refer to the education, knowledge, training, experience, or skill of a person which makes them potentially valuable to an employer. This has historically been understood as a cause of the gendered wage gap but is no longer a predominant cause as women and men in certain occupations tend to have similar education levels or other credentials. Even when such characteristics of jobs and workers are controlled for, the presence of women within a certain occupation leads to lower wages. This earnings discrimination is considered to be a part of pollution theory. This theory suggests that jobs which are predominated by women offer lower wages than do jobs simply because of the presence of women within the occupation. As women enter an occupation, this reduces the amount of prestige associated with the job and men subsequently leave these occupations. The entering of women into specific occupations suggests that less competent workers have begun to be hired or that the occupation is becoming deskilled. Men are reluctant to enter female-dominated occupations because of this and similarly resist the entrance of women into male-dominated occupations. \n\nThe gendered income disparity can also be attributed in part to occupational segregation, where groups of people are distributed across occupations according to ascribed characteristics; in this case, gender. Occupational gender segregation can be understood to contain two components or dimensions; horizontal segregation and vertical segregation. With horizontal segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as men and women are thought to possess different physical, emotional, and mental capabilities. These different capabilities make the genders vary in the types of jobs they are suited for. This can be specifically viewed with the gendered division between manual and non-manual labor. With vertical segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as occupations are stratified according to the power, authority, income, and prestige associated with the occupation and women are excluded from holding such jobs.\n\nAs women entered the workforce in larger numbers since the 1960s, occupations have become segregated based on the amount femininity or masculinity presupposed to be associated with each occupation. Census data suggests that while some occupations have become more gender integrated (mail carriers, bartenders, bus drivers, and real estate agents), occupations including teachers, nurses, secretaries, and librarians have become female-dominated while occupations including architects, electrical engineers, and airplane pilots remain predominately male in composition. Based on the census data, women occupy the service sector jobs at higher rates than men. Women’s overrepresentation in service sector jobs, as opposed to jobs that require managerial work acts as a reinforcement of women and men into traditional gender roles that causes gender inequality.\n“The gender wage gap is an indicator of women’s earnings compared with men’s. It is figured by dividing the average annual earnings for women by the average annual earnings for men.” (Higgins et al., 2014) \nScholars disagree about how much of the male-female wage gap depends on factors such as experience, education, occupation, and other job-relevant characteristics. Sociologist Douglas Massey found that 41% remains unexplained, while CONSAD analysts found that these factors explain between 65.1 and 76.4 percent of the raw wage gap. CONSAD also noted that other factors such as benefits and overtime explain \"additional portions of the raw gender wage gap\".\n\nThe glass ceiling effect is also considered a possible contributor to the gender wage gap or income disparity. This effect suggests that gender provides significant disadvantages towards the top of job hierarchies which become worse as a person’s career goes on. The term glass ceiling implies that invisible or artificial barriers exist which prevent women from advancing within their jobs or receiving promotions. These barriers exist in spite of the achievements or qualifications of the women and still exist when other characteristics that are job-relevant such as experience, education, and abilities are controlled for. The inequality effects of the glass ceiling are more prevalent within higher-powered or higher income occupations, with fewer women holding these types of occupations. The glass ceiling effect also indicates the limited chances of women for income raises and promotion or advancement to more prestigious positions or jobs. As women are prevented by these artificial barriers, from either receiving job promotions or income raises, the effects of the inequality of the glass ceiling increase over the course of a woman’s career.\n\nStatistical discrimination is also cited as a cause for income disparities and gendered inequality in the workplace. Statistical discrimination indicates the likelihood of employers to deny women access to certain occupational tracks because women are more likely than men to leave their job or the labor force when they become married or pregnant. Women are instead given positions that dead-end or jobs that have very little mobility.\n\nIn Third World countries such as the Dominican Republic, female entrepreneurs are statistically more prone to failure in business. In the event of a business failure women often return to their domestic lifestyle despite the absence of income. On the other hand, men tend to search for other employment as the household is not a priority.\n\nThe gender earnings ratio suggests that there has been an increase in women’s earnings comparative to men. Men’s plateau in earnings began after the 1970s, allowing for the increase in women’s wages to close the ratio between incomes. Despite the smaller ratio between men and women’s wages, disparity still exists. Census data suggests that women’s earnings are 71 percent of men's earnings in 1999.\n\nThe gendered wage gap varies in its width among different races. Whites comparatively have the greatest wage gap between the genders. With whites, women earn 78% of the wages that white men do. With African Americans, women earn 90% of the wages that African American men do.\n\nThere are some exceptions where women earn more than men: According to a survey on gender pay inequality by the International Trade Union Confederation, female workers in the Gulf state of Bahrain earn 40 percent more than male workers.\n\nIn 2014, a report by the International Labor Organization (ILO) reveals the wage gap between Cambodian women factory workers and other male counterparts. There was a $25 USD monthly pay difference conveying that women have a much lower power and being devalued not only at home but also in the workplace.\n\nThe gender gap also appeared to narrow considerably beginning in the mid-1960s. Where some 5% of first-year students in professional programs were female in 1965, by 1985 this number had jumped to 40% in law and medicine, and over 30% in dentistry and business school. Before the highly effective birth control pill was available, women planning professional careers, which required a long-term, expensive commitment, had to \"pay the penalty of abstinence or cope with considerable uncertainty regarding pregnancy.\" This control over their reproductive decisions allowed women to more easily make long-term decisions about their education and professional opportunities. Women are highly underrepresented on boards of directors and in senior positions in the private sector.\n\nAdditionally, with reliable birth control, young men and women had more reason to delay marriage. This meant that the marriage market available to any women who \"delay[ed] marriage to pursue a career... would not be as depleted. Thus the Pill \"could\" have influenced women's careers, college majors, professional degrees, and the age at marriage.\"\n\nStudies on sexism in science and technology fields have produced conflicting results. Corinne et al. found that science faculty of both sexes rated a male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than an identical female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. Williams and Ceci, however, found that science and technology faculty of both sexes \"preferred female applicants 2:1 over identically qualified males with matching lifestyles\" for tenure-track positions. Studies show parents are more likely to expect their sons, rather than their daughters, to work in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics field – even when their 15-year-old boys and girls perform at the same level in mathematics.\n\nA survey by the U.K. Office for National Statistics in 2016 showed that in the health sector 56% of roles are held by women, while in teaching it is 68%. However equality is less evident in other area; only 30% of M.P.'s are women and only 32% of finance and investment analysts. In the natural and social sciences 43% of employees are women, and in the environmental sector 42%.\n\nA 2010 study conducted by David R. Hekman and colleagues found that customers who viewed videos featuring a black male, a white female, or a white male actor playing the role of an employee helping a customer were 19 percent more satisfied with the white male employee's performance.\n\nThis discrepancy with race can be found as early as 1947, when Kenneth Clark conducted a study in which black children were asked to choose between white and black dolls. White male dolls were the ones children preferred to play with.\n\nAlthough the disparities between men and women are decreasing in the medical field, gender inequalities still exist as social problems. From 1999 to 2008, recently qualified female doctors in the US made almost $170,000,000 less than their male counterparts. The pay discrepancy could not be explained by specialty choice, practice setting, work hours, or other characteristics. A case study carried out on Swedish medical doctors showed that the gender wage gap among physicians was greater in 2007 than in 1975.\n\nGender roles are heavily influenced by biology, with male-female play styles correlating with sex hormones, sexual orientation, aggressive traits, and pain. Furthermore, females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia demonstrate increased masculinity and it has been shown that rhesus macaque children exhibit preferences for stereotypically male and female toys.\n\nGender equality in relationships has been growing over the years but for the majority of relationships, the power lies with the male. Even now men and women present themselves as divided along gender lines. A study done by Szymanowicz and Furnham, looked at the cultural stereotypes of intelligence in men and women, showing the gender inequality in self-presentation. This study showed that females thought if they revealed their intelligence to a potential partner, then it would diminish their chance with him. Men however would much more readily discuss their own intelligence with a potential partner. Also, women are aware of people’s negative reactions to IQ, so they limit its disclosure to only trusted friends. Females would disclose IQ more often than men with the expectation that a real true friend would respond in a positive way. Intelligence continues to be viewed as a more masculine trait, than feminine trait. The article suggested that men might think women with a high IQ would lack traits that were desirable in a mate such as warmth, nurturance, sensitivity, or kindness. Another discovery was that females thought that friends should be told about one’s IQ more so than males. However, males expressed doubts about the test’s reliability and the importance of IQ in real life more so than women. The inequality is highlighted when a couple starts to decide who is in charge of family issues and who is primarily responsible for earning income. For example, in Londa Schiebinger’s book, \"Has Feminism Changed Science?\", she claims that \"Married men with families on average earn more money, live longer and happier, and progress faster in their careers,\" while \"for a working woman, a family is a liability, extra baggage threatening to drag down her career.\" Furthermore, statistics had shown that \"only 17 percent of the women who are full professors of engineering have children, while 82 percent of the men do.\"\n\nDespite the increase in women in the labour force since the mid-1900s, traditional gender roles are still prevalent in American society. Women may be expected to put their educational and career goals on hold in order to raise children, while their husbands work. However, women who choose to work as well as fulfill a perceived gender role of cleaning the house and taking care of the children. Despite the fact that different households may divide chores more evenly, there is evidence that supports that women have retained the primary caregiver role within familial life despite contributions economically. This evidence suggest that women who work outside the home often put an extra 18 hours a week doing household or childcare related chores as opposed to men who average 12 minutes a day in childcare activities. One study by van Hooff showed that modern couples, do not necessarily purposefully divide things like household chores along gender lines, but instead may rationalize it and make excuses. One excuse used is that women are more competent at household chores and have more motivation to do them. Another is that some say the demands of the males’ jobs is higher.\n\nThere was a study conducted at an \"urban comprehensive school\". They were asked questions regarding their views in sexual inequality. Many parents were for the equal pay for men and women. They also were in favor for men to help with the housework. In this study, the majority of the people who were interviewed wanted gender equality and more people wants a change in gender roles. Where men stay home, cleans, and cooks while the women can work and help support the family.\n\nGender roles have changed drastically over the past few decades. In the article, it says that in 1920-1966, there was data recorded that women spent the most time care-tending with the home and family. There was a study made with the gender roles with the males and females, The results showed that as women spend less time in the house, men have taken over the role as the mother. The article also said that women who work spend less time within the house and with their children if they have any. Furthermore, men are taking the roles of women in the homes and its changing as time goes on. Robin A. Douthitt, the author of the article, \"The Division of Labor Within the Home: Have Gender Roles Changed?\" concluded by saying, \"(1) men do not spend significnatly more time with chil- dren when their wives are employed and (2) employed women spend signifi- cantly less time in child care than their full-time homemaker counterparts, over a 10-year period both mothers and fathers are spending more total time with children.\" (703).\n\nOne survey showed that men rate their technological skills in activities such as basic computer functions and online participatory communication higher than women. However, it should be noted that this study was a self-reporting study, where men evaluate themselves on their own perceived capabilities. It thus is not data based on actual ability, but merely perceived ability, as participants' ability was not assessed. Additionally, this study is inevitably subject to the significant bias associated with self-reported data.\n\nIn contrary to such findings, a carefully controlled study that analyzed data sets from 25 developing countries led to the consistent finding that the reason why fewer women access and use digital technology is a direct result of their unfavorable conditions and ongoing discrimination with respect to employment, education and income. When controlling for these variables, women turn out to be more active users of digital tools than men. This turns the alleged digital gender divide into an opportunity: given women's affinity for ICT, and given that digital technologies are tools that can improve living conditions, ICT represents a concrete and tangible opportunity to tackle longstanding challenges of gender inequalities in developing countries, including access to employment, income, education and health services.\n\nMany countries have laws that give less inheritance of ancestral property for women compared to men.\n\nGender inequalities often stem from social structures that have institutionalized conceptions of gender differences.\n\nMarginalization occurs on an individual level when someone feels as if they are on the fringes or margins of their respective society. This is a social process and displays how current policies in place can affect people. For example, media advertisements display young girls with easy bake ovens (promoting being a housewife) as well as with dolls that they can feed and change the diaper of (promoting being a mother).\n\nCultural stereotypes, which can dictate specific roles, are engrained in both men and women and these stereotypes are a possible explanation for gender inequality and the resulting gendered wage disparity. Women have traditionally been viewed as being caring and nurturing and are designated to occupations which require such skills. While these skills are culturally valued, they were typically associated with domesticity, so occupations requiring these same skills are not economically valued. Men have traditionally been viewed as the main worker in the home, so jobs held by men have been historically economically valued and occupations predominated by men continue to be economically valued and earn higher wages.\n\nGender Stereotypes influenced greatly by gender expectations, different expectations on gender influence how people determine their roles, appearance, behaviors, etc. When expectations of gender roles deeply rooted in people's mind, people' values and ideas started to be influenced and leading to situation of stereotypes, which actualize their ideas into actions and perform different standards labelling the behaviors of people. Gender stereotypes limit opportunities of different gender when their performance or abilities were standardizing according to their gender-at-birth, that women and men may encounter limitations and difficulties when challenging the society through performing behaviors that their gender \"not supposed\" to perform. For example, men may receive judgments when they trying to stay at home and finish housework and allow their wives to go out and work instead, as men are expected to be work outside for earning money for the family. The traditional concepts of gender stereotypes are being challenged nowadays in different societies and improvement could be observed that men could also be responsible for housework, women could also be construction worker in some societies. It is still a long process when traditional concepts and values have deep-rooted in people's mind, that higher acceptance towards gender roles and characteristics is homely to be gradually developed.\n\nBonnie Spanier coined the term hereditary inequality. Her opinion is that some scientific publications depict human fertilization such that sperms seem to actively compete for the \"passive\" egg, even though in reality it is complicated (e.g. the egg has specific active membrane proteins that select sperm etc.)\n\nGender inequality can further be understood through the mechanisms of sexism. Discrimination takes place in this manner as men and women are subject to prejudicial treatment on the basis of gender alone. Sexism occurs when men and women are framed within two dimensions of social cognition.\n\nDiscrimination also plays out with networking and in preferential treatment within the economic market. Men typically occupy positions of power within the job economy. Due to taste or preference for other men because they share similar characteristics, men in these positions of power are more likely to hire or promote other men, thus discriminating against women.\n\nSonja B. Starr conducted a study in the US that found that the prison sentences that men serve are on average 63% longer than those that women serve when controlling for arrest offense and criminal history. However, the study does not purport to explain why this is the case. Starr does not believe that men are disadvantaged generally. Men's rights advocates have argued that men being over-represented in both those who commit murder and the victims of murder is evidence that men are being harmed by outmoded cultural attitudes.\n\nThe New York Film Academy took a closer look at the women in Hollywood and gathered statistics from the top 500 films from 2007 to 2012, for their history and achievements, or lack of.\n\nThere was a 5:1 ratio of men to women working in films. 30.8% of women having speaking characters, who may or may not have been a part of the 28.8% of women who were written to wear revealing clothing compared to the 7% of men who did, or the 26.2% of women who wore little to no clothing opposed to the 9.4% of men who did the same. A study analyzing five years of text from over 2,000 news sources found a similar 5:1 ratio of male to female names overall, and 3:1 for names in entertainment.\n\nHollywood actresses are paid less than actors. Topping \"Forbes\" highest paid actors list of 2013 was Robert Downey Jr. with $75 million, yet Angelina Jolie topped the highest paid actresses list with only $33 million, which tied with Denzel Washington ($33 million) and Liam Neeson ($32 million), who were the last two on the top ten highest paid actors list.\n\nIn the 2013 Academy Awards, 140 men were nominated for an award, but only 35 women were nominated. No woman was nominated for directing, cinematography, film editing, writing (original screenplay), or original score that year. Since the Academy Awards began in 1929, only seven women producers have won the Best Picture category (all of whom were co-producers with men), and only eight women have been nominated for Best Original Screenplay. Lina Wertmuller (1976), Jane Campion (1994), Sofia Coppola (2004), and Kathryn Bigelow (2012) were the only four women to be nominated for Best Director, with Bigelow being the first woman to win for her film \"The Hurt Locker\". 77% of the Academy Awards' voters are male.\n\nA group of Hollywood actors have launched their own social movement titled #AskMoreOfHim. This movement is built on the basis of men speaking out against sexual misconduct against females.   A number of male activists, specifically in the film industry, have signed an open letter explaining their responsibility in the ownership of their actions, as well as calling out the actions of others. The letter has been signed and supported by Friends actor David Schwimmer, shown above, among many others. The Hollywood Reporter published their support saying, “We applaud the courage and pledge our support to the courageous women — and men, and gender non-conforming individuals — who have come forward to recount their experiences of harassment, abuse and violence at the hands of men in our country. As men, we have a special responsibility to prevent abuse from happening in the first place... After all, the vast majority of sexual harassment, abuse and violence is perpetrated by men, whether in Hollywood or not.” This accountability is set to change the way women are seen and treated in the film and television industry, hopefully ending in the closing of the gap women are experiencing in pay, promotion, and overall respect. This initiative was created in response to the #MeToo movement. The #MeToo movement, started by a single tweet, asked women to share their stories of sexual assault against men in a professional setting. Within one day, 30,000 women had used the hashtag sharing their stories. Many women feel as if they have more power in their voices than they ever had and are choosing to make personal claims that may have been brushed under the rug prior to the internet culture we’re now living in. According to Time Magazine, 95% of women in the film and entertainment industry admit to being sexually harassed by men in their industry. In addition to the #MeToo movement, women in industry are using #TimesUp, with the goal of aiming to help prevent sexual harassment in the workplace for victims who cannot afford their own resources. \n\nGender inequality and discrimination are argued to cause and perpetuate poverty and vulnerability in society as a whole. Household and intra-household knowledge and resources are key influences in individuals' abilities to take advantage of external livelihood opportunities or respond appropriately to threats. High education levels and social integration significantly improve the productivity of all members of the household and improve equity throughout society. Gender Equity Indices seek to provide the tools to demonstrate this feature of poverty.\n\nPoverty has many different factors, one of which is the gender wage gap. Women are more likely to be living in poverty and the wage gap is one of the causes.\n\nThere are many difficulties in creating a comprehensive response. It is argued that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) fail to acknowledge gender inequality as a cross-cutting issue. Gender is mentioned in MDG3 and MDG5: MDG3 measures gender parity in education, the share of women in wage employment and the proportion women in national legislatures. MDG5 focuses on maternal mortality and on universal access to reproductive health. These targets are significantly off-track.\n\nAddressing gender inequality through social protection programmes designed to increase equity would be an effective way of reducing gender inequality, according to the Overseas Development Institute (ODI). Researchers at the ODI argue for the need to develop the following in social protection in order to reduce gender inequality and increase growth:\nThe ODI maintains that society limits governments' ability to act on economic incentives.\n\nNGOs tend to protect women against gender inequality and structural violence.\n\nDuring war, combatants primarily target men. Both sexes die however, due to disease, malnutrition and incidental crime and violence, as well as the battlefield injuries which predominately affect men. A 2009 review of papers and data covering war related deaths disaggregated by gender concluded \"It appears to be difficult to say whether more men or women die from conflict conditions overall.\" The ratio also depends on the type of war, for example in the Falklands War 904 of the 907 dead were men. Conversely figures for war deaths in 1990, almost all relating to civil war, gave ratios in the order of 1.3 males per female.\n\nAnother opportunity to tackle gender inequality is presented by modern information and communication technologies. In a carefully controlled study, it has been shown that women embrace digital technology more than men. Given that digital information and communication technologies have the potential to provide access to employment, education, income, health services, participation, protection, and safety, among others (ICT4D), the natural affinity of women with these new communication tools provide women with a tangible bootstrapping opportunity to tackle social discrimination.\n\nGender inequality is a result of the persistent discrimination of one group of people based upon gender and it manifests itself differently according to race, culture, politics, country, and economic situation. It is furthermore considered a causal factor of violence against women. While gender discrimination happens to both men and women in individual situations, discrimination against women is an entrenched, global pandemic. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, rape and violence against women and girls is used as a tool of war. In Afghanistan, girls have had acid thrown in their faces for attending school. Considerable focus has been given to the issue of gender inequality at the international level by organizations such as the United Nations (UN), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Bank, particularly in developing countries. The causes and effects of gender inequality vary geographically, as do methods for combating it.\n\nOne example of the continued existence of gender inequality in Asia is the \"missing girls\" phenomenon. \"Many families desire male children in order to ensure an extra source of income. In China, females are perceived as less valuable for labor and unable to provide sustenance.\" Moreover, gender inequality also reflected in educational aspect in rural China . Gender inequality existed because of gender stereotypes in rural China, families may consider that is useless for girls to acquire knowledge at school because they will marry someone one day and their major responsibility is to take care of housework. When people have expectations on the gender roles, that considering marriage is the major goals of a girl's life in rural China, gender inequality easily existed to limit the rights and opportunities of women.\n\nA Cambodian said, \"Men are gold, women are white cloth\", emphasizing that women had a lower value and importance compared to men. In Cambodia, approximately 15% (485,000 hectares) of land was owned by women. In Asian culture, there is a stereotype that women usually have lower status than men because males carry on the family name and hold the responsibilities to take care of the family. Females have a less important role, mainly to carry out domestic chores, and taking care of husbands and children. Women are also the main victims of poverty as they have little or no access to education, low pay and low chances owning assets such as lands, homes or even basic items.\n\nIn Cambodia, the Ministry of Women's Affairs (MoWA) was formed in 1998 with the role of improving women's overall power and status in the country.\n\nThe Global Gender Gap Report put out by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 2013 ranks nations on a scale of 0 to 1, with a score of 1.0 indicating full gender equality. A nation with 35 women and 65 men in political office would get a score of 0.538 as the WEF is measuring the gap between the two figures and not the actual percentage of women in a given category. While Europe holds the top four spots for gender equality, with Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden ranking 1st through 4th respectively, it also contains two nations ranked in the bottom 30 countries, Albania at 108 and Turkey at 120. The Nordic Countries, for several years, have been at the forefront of bridging the gap in gender inequality. Every Nordic country, aside from Denmark who is at 0.778, has reached above a 0.800 score. In contrast to the Nordic nations, the countries of Albania and Turkey continue to struggle with gender inequality. Albania and Turkey failed to break the top 100 nations in 2 of 4 and 3 of 4 factors, respectively. However, despite the disparity, European nations continue to make advances in the many factors that are used to determine a nation's gender gap score.\n\nWestern Europe, a region most often described as comprising the non-communist members of post-WWII Europe, has, for the most part been doing well in eliminating the gender gap. Western Europe holds 12 of the top 20 spots on the Global Gender Gap Report for overall score. While remaining mostly in the top 50 nations, four Western European nations fall below that benchmark. Portugal is just outside of the top 50 at number 51 with score of 0.706 while Italy (71), Greece (81) and Malta (84) received scores of 0.689, 0.678 and 0.676, respectively.\n\nA large portion of Eastern Europe, a region most often described as the former communist members of post-WWII Europe, resides between 40th and 100th place in the Global Gender Gap Report. A few outlier countries include Lithuania, which jumped nine places (37th to 28th) from 2011 to 2013, Latvia, which has held the 12th spot for two consecutive years, Albania and Turkey.\n\nIndia ranking remains low in gender equality measures by the World Economic Forum, although the rank has been improving in recent years. When broken down into components that contribute the rank, India performs well on political empowerment, but is scored near the bottom with China on sex selective abortion. India also scores poorly on overall female to male literacy and health rankings. India with a 2013 ranking of 101 out of 136 countries had an overall score of 0.6551, while Iceland, the nation that topped the list, had an overall score of 0.8731 (no gender gap would yield a score of 1.0). Gender inequalities impact India's sex ratio, women's health over their lifetimes, their educational attainment, and economic conditions. It is a multifaceted issue that concerns men and women alike.\n\nThe labor force participation rate of women was 80.7% in 2013. Nancy Lockwood of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest human resources association with members in 140 countries, in a 2009 report wrote that female labor participation is lower than men, but has been rapidly increasing since the 1990s. Out of India's 397 million workers in 2001, 124 million were women, states Lockwood.\n\nIndia is on target to meet its Millennium Development Goal of gender parity in education before 2016. UNICEF's measures of attendance rate and Gender Equality in Education Index (GEEI) attempt to capture the quality of education. Despite some gains, India needs to triple its rate of improvement to reach GEEI score of 95% by 2015 under the Millennium Development Goals. A 1998 report stated that rural India girls continue to be less educated than the boys.\n\nThe World Economic Forum measures gender equity through a series of economic, educational, and political benchmarks. It has ranked the United States as 19th (up from 31st in 2009) in terms of achieving gender equity. The US Department of Labor has indicated that in 2009, \"the median weekly earnings of women who were full-time wage and salary workers was... 80 percent of men's\". The Department of Justice found that in 2009, \"the percentage of female victims (26%) of intimate partner violence was about 5 times that of male victims (5%)\". \"The United States ranks 41st in a ranking of 184 countries on maternal deaths during pregnancy and childbirth, below all other industrialized nations and a number of developing countries\" and women only represent 20% of members of Congress.\n\nExisting research on the topic of gender/sex and politics has found differences in political affiliation, beliefs, and voting behavior between men and women, although these differences vary across cultures. Gender is omnipresent in every culture, and while there are many factors to consider when labeling people \"Democrat\" or \"Republican\"—such as race and religion—gender is especially prominent in politics. Studying gender and political behavior poses challenges, as it can be difficult to determine if men and women actually differ in substantial ways in their political views and voting behavior, or if biases and stereotypes about gender cause people to make assumptions. However, trends in voting behavior among men and women have been proven through research.\n\nResearch shows that women in postindustrial countries like the United States, Canada, and Germany primarily identified as conservative before the 1960s; however, as time has progressed and new waves of feminism have occurred, women have become more left-wing due to shared beliefs and values between women and parties more on the left. Women in these countries typically oppose war and the death penalty, favor gun control, support environment protection, and are more supportive of programs that help people of lower socioeconomic statuses. Voting behaviors of men have not experienced as drastic of a shift over the last fifty years as women in their voting behavior and political affiliations. These behaviors tend to consistently be more conservative than women overall. These trends change with every generation, and factors such as culture, race, and religion also must be considered when discussing political affiliation. These factors make the connection between gender and political affiliation complex due to intersectionality.\n\nCandidate gender also plays a role in voting behavior. Women candidates are far more likely than male candidates to be scrutinized and have their competence questioned by both men and women when they are seeking information on candidates in the beginning stages of election campaigns. Democrat male voters tend to seek more information about female Democrat candidates over male Democrat candidates. Female Republican voters tend to seek more information about female Republican candidates. For this reason, female candidates in either party typically need to work harder to prove themselves competent more than their male counterparts.\n\nOverall, politics in the United States are dominated by men, which can pose many challenges to women who decide to enter the political sphere. As the number of women participants in politics continue to increase around the world, the gender of female candidates serves as both a benefit and a hindrance within their campaign themes and advertising practices. The overarching challenge seems to be that—no matter their actions—women are unable to win in the political sphere as different standards are used to judge them when compared to their male counterparts.\n\nOne area in particular that exemplifies varying perceptions between male and female candidates is the way female candidates decide to dress and how their choice is evaluated. When women decide to dress more masculine, they are perceived as being \"conspicuous.\" When they decide to dress more feminine, they are perceived as \"deficient.\" At the same time, however, women in politics are generally expected to adhere to the masculine standard, thereby validating the idea that gender is binary and that power is associated with masculinity. As illustrated by the points above, these simultaneous, mixed messages create a \"double-bind\" for women. Some scholars go on to claim that this masculine standard represents symbolic violence against women in politics.\n\nPolitical knowledge is a second area where male and female candidates are evaluated differently and where political science research has consistently shown women with a lower level of knowledge than their male counterparts. One reason for this finding is the argument that there are different areas of political knowledge that different groups consider. Due to this line of thought, scholars are advocating the replacement of traditional political knowledge with gender-relevant political knowledge because women are not as politically disadvantaged as it may appear.\n\nA third area that affects women's engagement in politics is their low level of political interest and perception of politics as a \"men's game.\" Despite female candidates' political contributions being equal to that of male candidates, research has shown that women perceive more barriers to office in the form of rigorous campaigns, less overall recruitment, inability to balance office and family commitments, hesitancy to enter competitive environments, and a general lack of belief in their own merit and competence. Male candidates are evaluated most heavily on their achievements, while female candidates are evaluated on their appearance, voice, verbal dexterity, and facial features in addition to their achievements.\n\nSeveral forms of action have been taken to combat institutionalized sexism. People are beginning to speak up or \"talk back\" in a constructive way to expose gender inequality in politics, as well as gender inequality and under-representation in other institutions. Researchers who have delved into the topic of institutionalized sexism in politics have introduced the term \"undoing gender.\" This term focuses on education and an overarching understanding of gender by encouraging \"social interactions that reduce gender difference.\" Some feminists argue that \"undoing gender\" is problematic because it is context-dependent and may actually reinforce gender. For this reason, researchers suggest \"doing gender differently\" by dismantling gender norms and expectations in politics, but this can also depend on culture and level of government (e.g. local versus federal).\n\nAnother key to combating institutionalized sexism in politics is to diffuse gender norms through \"gender-balanced decision-making,\" particularly at the international level, which \"establishes expectations about appropriate levels of women in decision-making positions.\" In conjunction with this solution, scholars have started placing emphasis on \"the value of the individual and the importance of capturing individual experience.\" This is done throughout a candidate's political career—whether that candidate is male or female—instead of the collective male or female candidate experience. Five recommended areas of further study for examining the role of gender in U.S. political participation are (1) realizing the \"intersection between gender and perceptions\"; (2) investigating the influence of \"local electoral politics\"; (3) examining \"gender socialization\"; (4) discerning the connection \"between gender and political conservatism\"; and (5) recognizing the influence of female political role models in recent years. Due to the fact that gender is intricately entwined in every societal institution, gender in politics can only change once gender norms in other institutions change, as well.\n\n\nHiggins, M. and Reagan, M.

The earliest seal impression, in the Treasury of Durham Cathedral, is believed to be the Great Seal of Duncan II and dates to 1094.\n\nThe Chancellor had the custody of the King's Seal. \n\nStrictly, the continuation of the Great Seal of Scotland was guaranteed by the Treaty of Union which provided that \"a Seal in Scotland after the Union be alwayes kept and made use of in all things relating to private Rights or Grants, which have usually passed the Great Seal of Scotland, and which only concern Offices, Grants, Commissions, and private Rights within that Kingdom\". Hence, the Scotland Act 1998 refers to the current seal as \"the seal appointed by the Treaty of Union to be kept and made use of in place of the Great Seal of Scotland\". Nevertheless, the seal is still commonly referred to as the Great Seal of Scotland.\n\nSection 12 of the Treason Act 1708, still in force today, makes it treason in Scotland to counterfeit the seal.\n\nThe design of the Great Seal is a responsibility of the Lord Lyon King of Arms. The reverse of the seal shows the monarch on horseback, but is not changed from reign to reign—the current version is that engraved in 1911 for the accession of King George V.

From 1885 this office was held by the Secretary for Scotland, later the Secretary of State for Scotland. It transferred in 1999 to the First Minister of Scotland, whose place in the order of precedence in Scotland is determined by his or her office as Keeper of the Great Seal.

On March 11, 2004, the \"Toronto Star\" published an article about the resettlement of a group of refugees from Somalia to Hamilton, Ontario. The article focused on the Canadian government's new strategy to divert immigrant and refugee settlement away from the most popular destinations of Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. The article also described the support that the Somali refugees would receive from the Government of Canada:\nA single person receives $1,890 from the federal government as start-up allowance, along with $580 monthly social assistance, depending on how soon the person is able to find employment. They also each receive a night lamp, table, a chair and a single bed from the government.\nOn March 12, the day following the publication of the article, Nicholas Keung, the reporter who wrote the original article, received a \"polemic\" e-mail from a reader. The author of the e-mail mistakenly concluded that refugees receive a monthly allowance from the federal government greater than the monthly allowance received by pensioners. This e-mail was also copied to 100 other recipients. When the reporter tried to respond to the e-mail to correct the mistake, he found that the address no longer existed.\n\nOn the same day, a letter to the editor appeared in the \"Toronto Star\" in response to Keung's article. The letter stated:\nI think the effort to resettle refugees in smaller communities is an excellent effort. These refugees may find it easier to integrate into a smaller community especially if accompanied by some of their compatriots. I also find it interesting that the federal government provides a single refugee with a monthly allowance of $1,890 and each can also get an additional $580 in social assistance for a total of $2,470. This compares very well to a single pensioner who after contributing to the growth and development of Canada for 40 years can only receive a monthly maximum of $1,012 in old age pension and Guaranteed Income Supplement. Maybe our pensioners should apply as refugees?\nThe \"Toronto Star\" published this letter without checking the facts or the original article for clarification.\n\nFollowing the publication of the letter to the editor and the distribution of the forwarded e-mail, the \"Toronto Star\" was bombarded with e-mails from readers who felt that something should be done to ensure that pensioners received their fair due by the government. After investigating the matter and realizing that a mistake had been made, the ombudsman of the paper published an article on November 27, 2004, correcting the conclusion that refugees received more than pensioners. \"In hindsight, the ombud now wishes he'd issued a speedy clarification to help set the record straight\", he wrote. \"But with information (and misinformation) moving at a warp speed on the Internet, I doubt there was a silver bullet for the problem\".\n\nThis apology and correction of the mistake had little impact on the circulation of the newly born urban myth. The same letter to the editor appeared with minor alterations in over 50 newspapers, online newsletters, blogs, and discussion forums in the next three years. Six newspapers printed the same letter with slight alterations more than once on different dates and from different authors.\n\nUltimately; Citizenship and Immigration Canada published an online fact sheet on the issue in November 2006 to try to counter the spread of the false information.\n\n In 2006, Citizenship and Immigration Canada dismissed this rumour stating:\n\nRefugees don't receive more financial assistance from the federal government than Canadian pensioners. A letter to the editor of a Canadian newspaper contained this incorrect information. In it, a one-time, start-up payment provided to some refugees in Canada was mistaken for an ongoing, monthly payment. Unfortunately, although the newspaper published a clarification, the misleading information had already spread widely over e-mail and the internet.\n\nThere is no indication that this has had any impact as the letter has continued to appear on the Internet and the original email has been altered in some cases by replacing the Canadian context with an American one. Many conservative politicians and commentators, however, have embraced this urban legend in a general sense.\n\nIn 2008, the ABC program \"Media Watch\" documented several appearances of the hoax in Australia's mainstream media, beginning with \"The Cairns Post\" which published letters to the editor containing the claims, and using the same figures as the original Canadian email, in August 2007 and February 2008. Despite the \"Media Watch\" story, the same letters appeared two months later in \"The Courier-Mail\" in Brisbane and \"The West Australian\" in Perth. On April 21, 2008, 2GB talkback radio host Alan Jones read the email on air, and was critical of \"Media Watch\" when the program contacted him to advise him of the hoax.\n\nThe Australian government's Department of Immigration and Citizenship responded to a letter in the \"Sunraysia Daily\", drawing attention to the email's Canadian origins, and stating that benefits paid to refugees were on the same basis and at the same rate as those to any Australian resident.\n\nIn 2012 a version of the letter started circulating on Facebook, in the form of an open letter to \"Prime Minister the RT HON. David Cameron MP\".\n\n"}

{"id": "48005086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48005086", "title": "Korean beauty standards", "text": "Korean beauty standards\n\nKorean beauty standards are a distinct feature of Korean culture. In 2015, South Korea became the only Eastern Asian country (among many European and American countries like Brazil, US, Italy, Colombia, and others) that entered into the top 10 \"countries with the highest rate of cosmetic surgeries\" in the world based on the global survey by ISAPS (the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons). Examples of Korean beauty criteria include slim figures, a small face, V-shaped jaw, double eyelids that exemplify innocence, aegyo-sal (making the under eye bags puffy), small lips, straight eyebrows, large eyes and flawless skin.\n\nKorean beauty standards have varied influences, and K-pop is one of the biggest impacts. K-pop has become globalized and exposed around the world; aside from the music, the physical appearance of idols portray have impacted the beauty standards in Korea.\n\nKorean students are not allowed to wear make-up and jewellery in school. Students, especially girls, have low self-esteem about their appearance and are eager to be more beautiful than others. Some decide to have cosmetic surgery to change their facial features. The most recent ‘official’ statistic put the percentage of Koreans undergoing cosmetic surgery in 2008 at around 20% among young girls. This is significant as it shows how popular cosmetic surgery is in South Korea. Many companies require a photo, height, and even family backgrounds of the applicants as part of the hiring process.\n\nWhile Korean women are more critical of their body image, many are not satisfied with how they present themselves. There is low-self esteem and less satisfaction in comparison to women from the United States based on the survey.\n\nBeauty is often seen as a means for socioeconomic success in the rapidly modernized and post-war economy of South Korea, which has seen a sluggish growth rate for jobs after its economic boom period. This has left Korea with a highly skilled and educated workforce to compete for a short supply of job opportunities and chances for upward social mobility. Koreans view investments in beauty such as cosmetic products, services and medical beauty treatments such as plastic surgery, dermatology, and cosmetic dentistry as a means of cultural capital to achieve an edge over peers for social and economic advancement.\n\nWomen in South Korea spend more money on cosmetics than women in any other Asian country. In 2015, South Korea exported more than 2.64 billion dollars of cosmetic goods. It is much higher than in 2014 where they exported around 1.91 billion dollars. Some of the most popular products used in Korean are BB (blemish balm) creams, CC (color correction) creams, serums, essences, ampoules, sea weed face masks, and scrubs. Korean beauty products contain ingredients not commonly found in Western products such as snail extract. In 2011 BB cream hit the shelves in America, which was previously exclusively used in Korea had a massive effect. In 2014, the US market for BB cream was around 164 million dollars.\n\nA massive difference between American and Korean beauty is how they achieve beauty. Americans mostly have a three-step beauty regime which includes cleansing, tone, and moisturization. Koreans on the other hand have a ten step beauty regime which includes makeup remover and oil cleanser, water-based cleanser, exfoliation, toner, essences, serums, booster and ampoules, sheet masks, eye cream, moisturizer, and lastly sun protection.\n\nAsian cosmetics are gaining an increasing amount of success in the beauty industry. The Euromonitor International predict that by the year of 2019, around 80% of global skincare revenue will come from Asia. At the moment there is more Asian beauty products in the West specifically from East Asia, especially South Korea and Japan.\n\nTattoos are frowned upon in Korea. There is a tattoo movement but it is relatively small. The tattoo movement remains underground since it is a small movement. Most of the people you see with tattoos are artists, musicians, gangsters, and foreigners. Tattoos are not allowed on Korean television. If someone with tattoos is on television they are asked to cover up the tattoos with clothes such as a long sleeve shirt. They will even blur out the tattoos if they can visually see them.\n\nFor someone in Korea to legally (official certified) give tattoos in Korea they must be a doctor. A doctor is the only legal person to give tattoos to the general public.\n\nMost tattoo parlors are not advertised to the general public in a straightforward manner like a neon sign saying \"tattoos here\". Most of the time, a person must be in contact with someone who knows where to find a tattoo artist. Most tattoo parlors are in apartment buildings. The apartment buildings would most often have sterilization machine and clean leather seats. The few places that advertise themselves to the public have a similar setup but are more open in the eye of the public. These sites often get raided by the police, get expensive fines, and are even forced to close down. You can also find travelling tattoo artists who are more likely go to the clients’ house or have the client come to their house.\n\nPlastic surgery in Korea is not only socially accepted but estimates have shown that one in three South Korean women between the age of 19 and 49 have had at least one surgery. Double eyelid surgery (also known as blepharoplasty) is the most common procedure, with which an eyelid crease is created to make the eye look bigger. This type of surgery or rhinoplasty is typically given as a high school graduation gift.\n\nDue to the differences in the facial bone structure of Asians, who have a wider, flatter facial bone structure than their western counterparts, facial bone contouring surgeries are extremely popular. V-line surgery (jaw and chin reduction) and cheekbone (zygoma) reduction surgeries are used to change the facial contour. Most celebrities are required to undergo these surgeries to trim the cheekbones, jaw and chin to create an oval shaped face which is considered to be the Korean standard of facial beauty. \n\nWith the rise in social acceptance of plastic surgery, shows like “LET ME IN” where complete surgery makeovers are given to unfortunate participants like Huh Ye Eun who have suffered due to deformities, are transformed and given a new lease of life. Shows like those have spread the popularity of Korean plastic surgery worldwide.\n\nSouth Korea has also seen an increasing influx of people wanting to have facial bone contouring surgeries due to the advanced techniques and clinical expertise of the Korean surgeons. Various advances in facial bone contouring surgeries like the T-osteotomy technique and the first published book on facial bone contouring surgeries further illustrates the advanced surgery methods used by Korean surgeons.\n\nFor the well-known Korean beauty standards, the first things that come into the public's mind would probably be pale skins, small face, and slim figures. However, these days in China, the beauty trend is also known as having the skin \"not only be pale, but as white as possible\", \"ideally small face which is e dan lain 鵝蛋臉 (translated into shaped like an upside down goose egg)\", and with slim bodies \"hopefully tall with long legs, small feet and a Pippa Middleton style bottom\".\n\nEven though Korean and Chinese beauty standards may sound quite similar, some details of these categories can still help to distinguish the differences between Koreans and Chinese easily. First of all, contemporary Korean beauty standards of eye makeup have shifted from traditional \"sexy\" cat eye to a \"cuter\" and more innocent puppy eye. The point of makeup is to \"purposefully create puffy under eyes, which are called the aegyo-sal (translated into the baby fat under the eye)\". Some people even tried to do plastic surgery for it. According to Allure, \"People think it makes your eyes look brighter and more youthful\". A representative Korean idol for the puppy eyes can be Chou Tzu-yu from Twice under the JYP entertainment.\n\nOn the other hand, big and cute eyes are also popular among the Chinese beauty trends. However, since \"50% of the Chinese girls have single eyelids, which they consider unattractive\", the Chinese girls tend to do eye surgery or use makeup techniques to make their eyes look as large as possible. For eye makeup, Chinese women tend to use darker eyeliners, such as black or dark brown, to exaggerate their eyes, whereas the Korean girls tend to pursue a more natural eye makeup by using lighter color eyeliners to create dedicated eyes. Moreover, Chinese beauty trends also introduce the puppy eyes as the Wo Chan 臥蟬 (translated into lying silkworm) to the public. It is known as a 4 to 7 millimeter puff that lies under the under eyelashes that look like a silkworm, which make the girls look cute and sweet when they smile. According to the Chinese traditional face reading, the people with Wo Chan臥蟬 are born to have good lives with good fortunes for their relationships and business.\n\nHaving a slim figure is probably one of the most important part in both Korean and Chinese beauty standards. However, the ways the idols from these two countries to keep fit are very different. The famous Korean singer IU under Leon entertainment is well-known for her diet plan, which she only has \"one apple for breakfast, one sweet potato for lunch, and a cup of protein for dinner\". Even though she is already known to the public as slim and tiny; only 162 centimeters tall and weighing around 45 kilograms, before important events, she would drink 3 liters of waters for 5 days straight to make her face look small on the 7th day. (6) \"And on the seventh day, you are basically a skeleton,\" she emphasized, adding that \"this way, you can go from thin to skeleton-skinny\". To look skinny on TV, the Korean idols would try all kinds of diets to keep their faces small and legs slim, which starts a trend for the girls all around Korean to follow these diet plans in order to be called \"skinny and beautiful\".\n\nOn the other hand, a famous Chinese actress Zheng Shuang 鄭爽 is known for her skinny zombie-like body, who is 168 centimeters tall but only weighs around 37 kilograms. In Chinese beauty standards, women should be as skinny as possible where people can see their bones. However, instead of eating less, most of the Chinese actresses chose to not eat at all or only eat 7 grains of rice one day to lose weight. One of the trends that happened a few years ago was called the A4 waist challenge, or the ant waist challenge, which the women hold up sheets of paper and take selfies - they \"win\" if the paper entirely obscures their waist, and the standard paper size is only across.\"\n\nAssembly Required; in Seoul's 'Makeover Town,' Surgeons Struggle to Keep up with Demand for Faces as Seen on TV\n"}

This includes a complete list of films with which he was involved (including the films on which he worked as assistant director before becoming a full director), as well as his little-known contributions to theater, television and literature.\n\nA documentary film about the Noh theater, \"Gendai no No\" (\"Modern Noh\"), which was begun by the director during a break in the shooting of \"Ran\", but was abandoned after about fifty minutes were filmed, is being completed according to Kurosawa's script and notes.\n\nNote: Data for the remainder of this filmography is derived primarily from the complete filmography created by Kurosawa's biographer, Stuart Galbraith IV, supplemented by IMDB's Kurosawa page.\n\nFor the following films that Kurosawa directed, he also received a production credit:\n\nIn addition, Kurosawa received a production credit on one film that he himself did not direct: \"Haru no tawamure\" (1949) (\"Spring Flirtation\"), written and directed by Kajiro Yamamoto, on which he served as an associate producer.\n\nKurosawa wrote or co-wrote the screenplays for all the films he himself directed. However, to supplement his income, he also wrote scripts for other Japanese directors throughout the 1940s, and even through the 1950s and part of the 1960s, long after he had become world-famous. He also worked on the scripts for two Hollywood productions he was slated to direct, but which, for complex reasons, were completed by and credited to other directors (although he reportedly did shoot some scenes for \"Tora tora tora!\", the footage from which has apparently not survived). Finally, near the end of his life, he completed scripts he intended to direct but did not live to make, which were then filmed by others. A table of all these screenplays is given below; all titles are Japanese productions unless otherwise noted.\n\nIn addition, Kurosawa wrote the following unproduced scripts, composed during the pre-war period in the 1930s and also the wartime period in the 1940s, either when he was still an assistant director or had just graduated to full director. Some of these won prizes in screenwriting contests, establishing his reputation as a promising talent even though they were never filmed.\n\n\nKurosawa edited all his own films, though he only occasionally took screen credit for it. There are, however, only a few instances in which he edited the work of others, as listed below.\n\n\nDuring the mid-to-late 1940s, for the first and apparently the only time in his career, Akira Kurosawa involved himself in a number of theater-related projects.\n\n\nShortly before the theatrical release of \"Dodesukaden\", a TV documentary about horses called \"Uma no Uta\" (\"Song of the Horse\"), directed by Kurosawa, was broadcast in Japan on August 31, 1970. (Kurosawa otherwise totally avoided working in television.) Almost nothing is known about this documentary and, as of August 2010, it is not available on home video in any form.\n\nPrior to writing the screenplay to his film, \"Stray Dog\" (\"Nora Inu\", 1949), Kurosawa created, in about six weeks, a novel based on the same story (presumably also called \"Stray Dog\"), which he never published. It was written in the style of one of his favorite writers, the French crime author Georges Simenon. Writing it was supposed to help him compose the script as quickly as possible, but he found that writing the screenplay took even longer than usual because of the complex differences between literature and film.\n\nIn 1980, inspired by the memoir of one of his heroes, Jean Renoir, he began to publish in serial form his autobiography, entitled \"Gama no abura\" (\"An Oily Toad\"). The book deals with the period from the director's birth to his winning the Golden Lion for \"Rashomon\" from the Venice Film Festival in 1951; the period from 1951 through 1980 is not covered. The title of the book is a reference to a legend according to which, if one places a deformed toad in a box full of mirrors, it will become so afraid of its own reflection that it will begin to sweat, and this sweat allegedly had medicinal properties. Kurosawa compared himself to the toad, nervous about having to contemplate, through the process of writing his life story, his own multiple \"reflections.\" It was published as a book in Japan in 1981, and in English translation the following year under the title \"Something Like an Autobiography\". The book's appearance coincided with the revival of interest in Kurosawa's work following the international release of \"Kagemusha.\" ()\n\nIn 1999, his book, \"Yume wa tensai de aru\" (\"A Dream Is a Genius\") was published posthumously. It has not been translated into English, except for Chapter 3. This chapter consists of a selection of 100 of the director's favorite films, listed in chronological order, with detailed commentaries on each film, all given at the request of Kurosawa's daughter, Kazuko. (Since he deliberately limits himself to one film per director, however, the list emerges as more of a \"favorite directors\" list than a \"greatest films\" list.) This chapter, but not the remainder of the book, can be found in English on the Internet. ()\n\n\"Complete Drawings\" (with text in Japanese) was published by Shogakukan in 1999.

In most cases, the aim is to introduce a new trait to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species. As of 2015, 26 plant species have been genetically modified and approved for commercial release in at least one country. The majority of these species contain genes that make them either tolerant to herbicides or resistant to insects. Other common traits include virus resistance, delayed ripening, modified flower colour or altered composition. In 2014, 28 countries grew GM crops, and 39 countries imported but did not grow them.\n\nRegulations regarding the commercialisation of genetically modified crops are mostly conducted by individual countries. For cultivation, environmental approval determines whether a crop can be legally grown. Separate approval is generally required to use GM crops in food for human consumption or as animal feed.\n\nGM crops were first planted commercially on a large scale in 1996, in the US, China, Argentina, Canada, Australia, and Mexico. Some countries have approved but not actually cultivated GM crops, due to public uncertainty or further government restrictions, while at the same time, they may import GM foods for consumption. For example, Japan is a leading GM food importer, and permits but has not grown GM food crops. The European Union regulates importation of GM foods, while individual member states determine cultivation. In the US, separate regulatory agencies handle approval for cultivation (USDA, EPA) and for human consumption (FDA).\nTwo genetically modified crops have been approved for food use in some countries, but have not obtained approval for cultivation. A GM Melon engineered for delayed senescence was approved in 1999 and a herbicide tolerant GM wheat was approved in 2004.\n\nIn 2014, 181.5 million hectares of genetically modified crops were planted in 28 countries. Half of all GM crops planted were genetically modified soybeans, either for herbicide tolerance or insect resistance. Eleven countries grew modified soybean, with the USA, Brazil and Argentina accounting for 90% of the total hectarage. Of the 111 hectares of soybean grown worldwide in 2014, 82% was genetically modified in some way. Seventeen countries grew a total of 55.2 million hectares of genetically modified maize and fifteen grew 23.9 hectares of genetically modified cotton. Nine million hectares of genetically modified canola was grown with 8 million of those in Canada. Other GM crops grown in 2014 include Alfalfa (862 000 ha), sugar beet (494 000 ha) and papaya (7 475 ha). In Bangladesh a genetically modified eggplant was grown commercially for the first time on 12ha.\n\nThe majority of GM crops have been modified to be resistant to selected herbicides, usually a glyphosate or glufosinate based one. In 2014, 154 million hectares were planted with a herbicide resistant crop and 78.8 million hectares had insect resistant. This include 51.4 million hectares planted in thirteen countries that contained both herbicide tolerance and insect resistance. Less than one million hectares contained other traits, which include providing virus resistance, delaying senescence, modifying flower colour and altering the plants composition. Drought tolerant maize was planted for just the second year in the USA on 275 000 hectares.\n\nGenetically modified crops engineered to resist herbicides are now more available than conventionally bred resistant varieties. They comprised 83% of the total GM crop area, equating to just under 8% of the arable land worldwide. Approval has been granted to grow crops engineered to be resistant to the herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, dicamba, glufosinate glyphosate, sulfonylurea, oxynil mesotrione and isoxaflutole Most herbicide resistant GM crops have been engineered for glyphosate tolerance, in the USA 93% of soybeans and most of the GM maize grown is glyphosate tolerant.\n\nMost currently available genes used to engineer insect resistance come from the \"Bacillus thuringiensis\" bacterium. Most are in the form of delta endotoxin genes known as cry proteins, while a few use the genes that encode for vegetative insecticidal proteins. Insect resistant crops target various species of coleopteran (beetles) and lepidopteran (moths). The only gene commercially used to provide insect protection that does not originate from \"B. thuringiensis\" is the Cowpea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI was first approved for use cotton in 1999 and is currently undergoing trials in rice.\n\nMany varieties of GM crops contain more than one resistance gene. This could be in the form of multiple insect resistant genes, multiple herbicide tolerance genes or a combination of the herbicide and insect resistant genes. Smartstax is a brand of GM maize that has eight different genes added to it, making it resistant to two types of herbicides and toxic to six different species of insects.\n\nWhile most crops are engineered to resist insects or tolerate herbicides some crops have been developed for other traits. Flowers have been engineered to display colours that they cannot do so naturally (in particular the blue color in roses). A few crops, like the genetically modified papaya, are engineered to resist viruses. Other modifications alter the plants composition, with the aim of making it more nutritious, longer lasting or more industrially useful. Recently crops engineered to tolerate drought have been commercialised.\n\nThe following graph shows the area planted in GM crops in the five largest GM crop producing countries. The area planted is presented along the y axis in thousands of hectares while the year is along the x axis.\n\n"}

{"id": "777042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=777042", "title": "Mercy", "text": "Mercy\n\nMercy (Middle English, from Anglo-French \"merci\", from Medieval Latin \"merced-\", \"merces\", from Latin, \"price paid, wages\", from \"merc-\", \"merxi\" \"merchandise\") is benevolence, forgiveness, and kindness in a variety of ethical, religious, social, and legal contexts.\n\nThe concept of a merciful God appears in various religions, including Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism and Islam. Performing acts of mercy as a component of religious beliefs is also emphasized through actions such as the giving of alms, and care for the sick and Works of Mercy.\n\nIn the social and legal context, mercy may refer both to compassionate behavior on the part of those in power (e.g. mercy shown by a judge toward a convict), or on the part of a humanitarian third party, e.g., a mission of mercy aiming to treat war victims.\n\n\"Mercy\" can be defined as \"compassion or forbearance shown especially to an offender or to one subject to one's power\"; and also \"a blessing that is an act of divine favor or compassion.\" \"To be at someone's mercy\" indicates a person being \"without defense against someone.\"\n\nIn a judicial context mercy is often termed \"clemency\". It is a sovereign prerogative that resides in the executive and is entirely discretionary. John Locke defined it as \"the power to act according to discretion, for the public good, without the prescription of the Law, and sometimes even against it.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit explained that \"The very nature of clemency is that it is grounded solely in the will of the dispenser of clemency. He need give no reasons for granting it or for denying it.\"\n\nHebrews 4:16 says, \"So let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help.\" Grace and mercy are similar in that both are free gifts of God and both are dispensed absent any merit on the part of the recipient. Grace is the favor of God, a divine assistance. Grace is what one receives that they do not deserve while mercy is what one receives when they do \"not\" get that which they deserve. \n\nAn emphasis on mercy appears in the New Testament, for example in the Magnificat and Benedictus (Song of Zechariah), in Luke's Gospel, and in the Beatitudes in : \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy\". In Apostle Paul refers to the mercy of God in terms of salvation: \"God, being rich in mercy... even when we were dead through our sins, made us alive together with Christ\".\n\nPsalm 117 calls upon all nations to praise the Lord, and that on account of his \"merciful kindness\". This is quoted by the Apostle Paul in Romans 15:11 to show that God has now fulfilled this prophecy and promise through Jesus Christ, who has been merciful in giving his life as a sacrifice for his people, both Jew and Gentile. Thus St Peter writes in 1 Peter 2:9,10:\n\nThis devotional element of mercy as part of the Christian tradition was echoed by Saint Augustine who called mercy \"ever ancient, ever new\". The Works of Mercy (seven corporal and seven spiritual works) are part of the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions.\n\nIn the encyclical \"Dives in misericordia\" (\"Rich in Mercy\") Pope John Paul II examines the role of mercy—both God's mercy, and also the need for human mercy. He sees in the Parable of the Prodigal Son () \"the essence of the divine mercy\". Having squandered his patrimony, justice would dictate that the prodigal should only expect to be received back as a hireling. The figure of the father is analogous to God as Father, who goes beyond the requirements of justice to welcome his son with compassion.\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church emphasizes the importance of the Works of Mercy (item 2447) and in Roman Catholic teachings, the mercy of God flows through the work of the Holy Spirit. Roman Catholic liturgy includes frequent references to mercy, e.g., as in \"Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison\": Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy.\n\nMercy has also been an important subject of Christian iconography. Since the Middle Ages, many representations in art encouraged people to practice the works of mercy and, as the art historian Ralf van Bühren explains using the example of Caravaggio, helped \"the audience to explore mercy in their own lives\".\n\nIn the 20th century, there was new focus on mercy in the Roman Catholic Church, partly due to the Divine Mercy devotion. The primary focus of the Divine Mercy devotion is the merciful love of God and the desire to let that love and mercy flow through one's own heart towards those in need of it. \nPope John Paul II was a follower of the Divine Mercy devotion, due to Saint Mary Faustina Kowalska (1905–1938), who is known as the \"Apostle of Mercy\". \n\nA number of Roman Catholic shrines are specifically dedicated to Divine Mercy, e.g.\nthe Basilica of Divine Mercy in Krakow Poland, and the National Shrine of The Divine Mercy (Stockbridge, Massachusetts). During the dedication of the Basilica of Divine Mercy John Paul II quoted and called mercy the \"greatest attribute of God Almighty\".\n\nThe first \"World Apostolic Congress on Mercy\" was held in Rome in April 2008 and was inaugurated by Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nOn 11 April, 2015, at St. Peter's Basillica, in a Papal Bull of Indiction entitled \"Misericordiae Vultus\" (\"The Face of Mercy\"), Pope Francis proclaimed a Special and Extraordinary Holy Year Jubilee Year of Mercy, from December 8, 2015: Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, until November 21, 2016: the Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ the King. The theme of the Extraordinary Jubilee is taken from Luke 6:36, \"Merciful, Like the Father\".\n\nIn Islam the title \"Most Merciful\" (al-Rahman) is one of the names of Allah and Compassionate (al-Rahim), is the most common name occurring in the Quran. Rahman and Rahim both derive from the root Rahmat, which refers to tenderness and benevolence. As a form of mercy, the giving of alms (zakat) is the fourth of the Five Pillars of Islam and one of the requirements for the faithful.\n\nThe Hebrew word for mercy is \"Rachamim\" which is always in plural form so that it literally means \"mercies\". \"Mercy includes showing kindness to those who don’t deserve it, and forgiving those that deserve punishment.\"\n\nMercy is one of the defining characteristics of God. Exodus 34:6 says: \"The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.\" This is also emphasized in the context of the Babylonian exile in Isaiah: \"For the Lord has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his suffering ones. But Zion said, 'The Lord has forsaken me, my Lord has forgotten me.' Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you.\" (Isaiah 49:13-15) Also: \"It is good to pray and fast, to be merciful and just.\" (Tobit 12:8) \n\nWhen David, because of his sin, was told to choose between a three-year famine, pursuit by his enemies for three months, or a three-day pestilence, he chose the pestilence saying, \"Let us fall by the hand of God, for he is most merciful; but let me not fall by the hand of man.\" Psalm 103:8 praises God for his mercy.\n\nKwan Yin the bodhisattva of mercy and compassion, is one of the best known and most venerated Bodhisattva in Asia.\n\nKaruṇā (often translated as \"compassion\") is part of the beliefs of both Buddhism and Jainism. Karuṇā is present in all schools of Buddhism and in Jainism it is viewed as one of the reflections of universal friendship.\n\nThe spiritual teacher Meher Baba described God as being \"all-merciful and eternally benevolent\" in his O Parvardigar prayer, and he held that we can approach God through the \"invocation of His mercy.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It has been argued that the two poles of similarity and contiguity are fundamental ones along which the human brain is structured; in the study of human language the two poles have been called metaphor and metonymy, while in the study of the unconscious they have been called condensation and displacement. In linguistics, they are connected to the paradigmatic and syntagmatic poles.\n\nThe couple metaphor-metonymy had a prominent role in the renewal of the field of rhetoric in the 1960s. In his 1956 essay, \"The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles\", Roman Jakobson describes the couple as representing the possibilities of linguistic selection (metaphor) and combination (metonymy); Jakobson's work became important for such French structuralists as Claude Lévi-Strauss and Roland Barthes. In his essay, Jakobson also argues that metaphor is the basis for poetry, especially as seen in literary Romanticism and Symbolism, whereas metonymy forms the basis for Realism in literature.\n\nAccording to Freud's work (1900), condensation and displacement (from German \"Verdichtung\" and \"Verschiebung\") are two closely linked concepts. In the unconscious, through the dynamic movement of cathexis (charge of libido, mental or emotional energy), it is possible that an idea (image, memory, or thought) passes on its whole charge to another idea; Freud called this process \"displacement.\" It is also possible that a single idea takes the whole charge of more than one other ideas; Freud called this process \"condensation.\" In other words, a condensation is when more than one displacement occurs towards the same idea.\n\nIn 1957, Jacques Lacan, inspired by an article by linguist Roman Jakobson, argued that the unconscious has the same structure of a language, and that condensation and displacement are equivalent to the poetic functions of metaphor and metonymy.\n\n"}
{"id": "34404303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34404303", "title": "Morphome (linguistics)", "text": "Morphome (linguistics)\n\nThe term morphome refers to a function in linguistics which is purely morphological or has an irreducibly morphological component. The term was introduced by Martin Maiden following Mark Aronoff's identification of morphomic functions and the morphomic level—a level of linguistic structure intermediate between and independent of phonology and syntax. In distinguishing this additional level, Aronoff makes the empirical claim that all mappings from the morphosyntactic level to the level of phonological realisation pass through the intermediate morphomic level.\n\nFunctions defined at the morphomic level are of many qualitatively different types.\n\nOne example is the different ways the perfect participle can be realised in English––sometimes, this form is created through suffixation, as in \"bitten\" and \"packed\", sometimes through a process of ablaut, as in \"sung\", and sometimes through a combination of these, such as \"broken\", which uses ablaut as well as the suffix \"-n\". Since these processes, which achieve the same result, are of different categories, it is not possible to call the formation of the perfect participle in English a suffix, so it must be assumed that it exists as an abstract category on the morphomic level.\n\nAnother is the division of lexemes into distinct inflectional classes. Inflectional classes present distinct morphological forms, but these distinctions bear no meaning beyond signalling inflectional patterns; they are internal to morphology, and thus morphomic.\n\nMartin Maiden's theory of morphomes has been mostly developed with regard to the Romance languages, where he identified many examples of morphomic stem distributions.\n\nA different typology of morphomic patterns has been put forth by Erich Round. He distinguishes rhizomorphomes, which are a property of roots (corresponding to the traditional notion of inflectional class), metamorphomes, which are a property of paradigms, a set of cells which behave in a particular way (corresponding to the morphome in Maiden's terms, such as patterns of stem distribution), and meromorphomes, which are a property of exponents, and have only been identified for now in Kayardild and related languages.\n"}

{"id": "1236047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1236047", "title": "Métis", "text": "Métis\n\nThe Métis () are members of ethnic groups native to Canada and parts of the United States that trace their descent to indigenous North Americans and European settlers. Originally the term applied to French-speaking mixed-race families, especially in the Red River area of what became Manitoba, Canada; in the late 19th century in Canada, those of mixed English descent were classified separately as Mixed Bloods.\n\nSince the late 20th century, the Métis in Canada have been recognized as a distinct aboriginal people under the Constitution Act of 1982; they number 451,795 as of 2011. Smaller communities identifying as Métis exist in the U.S.\n\nThe word derives from the French adjective \"métis\", also spelled \"metice\", referring to a hybrid, or someone of mixed ancestry. In the 16th century, French colonists used the term \"métis\" as a noun for people of mixed European and indigenous American parentage in New France (Quebec) and La Louisiane in North America; at the time, it applied generally to French-speaking people who were of partial ethnic French descent. (It is related to the Spanish term \"Mestizo\", which has the same meaning.) It later came to be used for people of mixed European and indigenous backgrounds in other French colonies, including Guadeloupe in the Caribbean; Senegal in West Africa; Algeria in North Africa; and the former French Indochina in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn Latin America, a similar word is \"mestizo\" in Spanish-speaking countries, and in Portuguese-speaking countries, \"mestiço\" is also used. The English word \"mestee\" is a corruption of the Middle French \"mestis\" (the letters 's' both pronounced at the start of the Middle French period, and both silent at the end of the Middle French period).\n\nIt has also been used to refer to people of mixed race born generally to indigenous women and French men in New France. The Métis in Canada married within their own group, and over time, created a distinct culture and ethnicity of their own. In former French colonies where slavery was part of society, a group known as \"gens du couleur libre\" (free people of color) developed from unions between African or mixed-race women and French male colonists. In New Orleans, the system of plaçage was well developed in the eighteenth century, in which women in these relationships received some protection by contracts, often negotiated by their mothers. Often the men freed the women, if they were enslaved, and their mixed-race children, if born into slavery. Property settlements were also part of the relationship, and the men sometimes provided for education of sons, sometimes in France.\nThe term \"mestee\" was widely used in the antebellum United States for mixed-race individuals, according to Jack D. Forbes. It was used for people of European and Native American ancestry, as well as European and African, and for those who were tri-racial. In the 19th century and up until 1930, United States census takers recorded people of color as mulatto, also meaning mixed race. \n\nAfter the American Civil War, the term \"mestee\" gradually fell into disuse when millions of slaves were emancipated as freedmen. As conservative whites in the South worked to re-establish white supremacy, they imposed Jim Crow laws after regaining control of state legislatures. In the early 20th century, they passed more stringent laws establishing the \"one-drop rule\". By this anyone with any known Sub-Saharan African ancestry was legally \"Black\", a more restrictive definition than had previously operated in the South, especially on the frontier. Scholar Jack D. Forbes has attempted to revive \"mestee\" as a term for the mixed-race peoples who were established as free before the Civil War.\n\nWorldwide, since the early 20th century the term Metis has been applied in various ways. \"Metisaje\" was used from the 1920s to the 1960s in some Latin American countries to indicate cultural hybridity, and at times to invoke a nationalist sentiment. Cultural \"Hybridity\" theorists have used the term \"métissage\" to examine postcolonial themes, including Françoise Lionnet. Creolité is a cultural and literary movement that has common threads with \"métis\" identity, and has been a counterpoint to the Négritude movement, although it has also been used to indicate \"race and gender specific\" themes as well.\n\n\"The Canadian Encyclopedia\" indicates that there is no complete consensus for the definition of Métis in Canada. The Canadian Encyclopedia's definition of Métis was not developed in consultation with Métis people or communities. It uses the following definition:\n\nWritten with a small m, \"métis\" is the French word for \"mixed\", and it is used here in a general sense for people of dual Indian-White ancestry. Capitalized, \"Métis\" generally refers to people of the post-contact indigenous people, the Métis Nation. It may variously refer to a distinctive socio cultural heritage, a means of ethnic self-identification, and sometimes a political and legal category, more or less narrowly defined.\nThe Métis Nation is considered to be rooted in what is known as the \"Métis Homeland,\" an area ranging from northwestern Ontario and moving westward across the prairies. In this area, fur trappers married indigenous Cree and Saulteaux women. A distinct ethnicity developed, as mixed-race descendants married within this group and remained involved with fur trapping and trading. They also began to farm in the Red River of the North area. \n\nPeople of \"mixed ancestry,\" although not of the Métis Nation, have a distinct history of their own. These unions began in the east, extending from the Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes. The fur trade and colonial development drew French voyageurs and coureurs des bois to the west, along with the later Hudson's Bay Company employees. Wintering partners of the fur trading companies typically took country wives for their months away from the eastern cities.\n\nAfter the fall of New France to the British 1763, many mixed-race populations continued to establish themselves, often specializing in the fur trade and related hunting. Some served as interpreters, as they often were fluent in both indigenous and European languages. English and Scottish traders married indigenous women, often the daughters of high-ranking chiefs, forming an elite mixed society. As the eighteenth century ended, the fur trade moved westward into the Plains. \n\nThe Métis Nation promoted their distinct and unique Indigenous identity in 1812, when Cuthbert Grant led a battle in the Pemmican War, flying the Métis flag. Many treaties throughout Canada were being negotiated in the nineteenth century, including in Ontario with the Robinson–Huron treaty. In 1870 the Métis at Red River, led by Louis Riel, resisted Canada's efforts to take over this area from the Hudson's Bay Company. They negotiated entry into Canada as the province of Manitoba, with promises to protect their land and rights. In 1885, the Métis resisted Canadian colonialism with the North-West Rebellion. The Métis were defeated and Riel was hanged as a traitor to Canada, but his role in history is controversial.\n\nMétis in the Métis Nation homeland received scrip under Section 32 of the Manitoba Act,and in the Northwest Territory via a series of Scrip Commissions that accompanied the negotiators of the numbered treaties in the Northwest Territory. Because scrip could only be applied to surveyed land, many Metis could not use it to purchase the unsurveyed land on which they were already living. They often moved onto the road allowances, where no roads had yet been built. The term \"Road Allowance people\" was used to describe these disposessed Metis. Racism toward Métis peoples in the west was prevalent during a large part of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. \n\nIn 1982, Métis were included as a distinct indigenous people in the Canadian constitution. They are defined as an ethnic group with their own culture, distinct from First Nations and Inuit peoples. Métis peoples have formed a variety of political organizations to promote their interests, and lobby the federal government through their primary national political association, the Métis National Council (MNC).\n\nIn 2003, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled in \"R.V. Powley\" that a family of Métis people in Ontario had the right to hunt moose as part of their Métis aboriginal rights. This case was funded by the Métis Nation of Ontario (MNO), a provincial affiliate of the MNC. The case established that the Métis had a history in Ontario, which was long debated by many people. The case also established the \"Powley test\", which helps to define who is Métis, and therefore eligible to rights as an aboriginal person.\n\nOn April 14, 2016, the Supreme Court in \"Daniels v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development)\" reached a landmark decision, ruling that Métis and non-status Indians are \"Indians\" for the purpose of s 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867.\n\n\n\n"}

There were no such cases of animosity in the 1960s, when scholarships provided by the Chinese government allowed many students from China-friendly African countries to study in Beijing. This policy was originally based on the idea of third world solidarity and Mao Zedong's linking of the fight against American and Soviet imperialism with Marxist class war. Many of these African students were given larger educational grants than native Chinese students, and hostility towards the Africans was a regular occurrence. Most of these students returned to their home countries before reaching the end of their courses due to poor living conditions and the political uncertainties of the Mao era. From the mid-1970s, China allowed African students to study outside of Beijing.\n\nAs well as resentment about the larger stipends given to African students, hostility from Chinese students towards Africans also flared up when there was contact between African men and Chinese women. In an incident in Shanghai in 1979, African students were attacked after playing loud music and making sexual remarks to Chinese women. These clashes became more common during the 1980s and sometimes led to arrests and deportations of African students. Cultural differences in dating habits added to the tensions.\n\nOn December 24, 1988 two male African students were entering their campus at Hohai University in Nanjing with two Chinese women. The occasion was a Christmas Eve party. A quarrel between one of the Africans and a Chinese security guard, who had suspected that the women the African students tried to bring into the campus were prostitutes and refused their entry, led to a brawl between the African and Chinese students on the campus which lasted till the morning, leaving 13 students injured. \n\n300 Chinese students, spurred by false rumors that a Chinese man had been killed by the Africans, broke into and set about destroying the Africans' dormitories, shouting slogans. Part of the destruction involved setting fire to the Africans' dormitory and locking them in. The President of the University had to order the fire department to take action.\n\nAfter the police had dispersed the Chinese students, many Africans fled to the railway station in order to gain safety at various African embassies in Beijing. The authorities prevented the Africans from boarding the trains so as to question those involved in the brawl. Soon their numbers increased to 140, as other African and non-African foreign students, fearing violence or simply by sympathy, arrived at the first-class waiting room at the station asking to be allowed to go to Beijing. \n\nBy this time, Chinese students from HoHai University had joined up with students from other Nanjing universities to make up a 3000-strong demonstration that called on government officials to prosecute the African students and reform the system which gave foreigners more rights than the Chinese. On the evening of December 26, the marchers converged on the railway station while holding banners calling for human rights and political reform. Chinese police managed to isolate the non-Chinese students from the marchers and moved them by force to a military guest house in Yizheng outside Nanjing. The protests were declared illegal, and riot police were brought in from surrounding provinces to pacify the demonstrators, which took several more days.\n\nThe African students and their sympathisers were removed from Yizheng to another military guesthouse closer to Nanjing on New Year's Eve, and were returned to their universities the following day.\n\nIn January, three of the African students were deported for starting the brawl. The other students returned to Hohai University and were required to follow new regulations, including a night-time curfew, having to report to university authorities before leaving the campus, and having no more than one Chinese girlfriend whose visits would be limited to the lounge area. Guests were still required to be registered.\n\nAnti-African demonstrations spread to other cities, including Shanghai and Beijing.\n\nThe Nanjing protests were groundbreaking dissidence for China and went from solely expressing concern about alleged improprieties by African men to increasingly calling for democracy or human rights. They were paralleled by burgeoning demonstrations in other cities during the period between the Nanjing and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, with some elements of the original protests that started in Nanjing still evident in Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, such as banners proclaiming \"Stop Taking Advantage of Chinese Women\" even though the vast majority of African students had left the country by that point.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "153907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153907", "title": "Neologism", "text": "Neologism\n\nA neologism (; from Greek νέο- \"néo-\", \"new\" and λόγος \"lógos\", \"speech, utterance\") is a relatively recent or isolated term, word, or phrase that may be in the process of entering common use, but that has not yet been fully accepted into mainstream language. Neologisms are often directly attributable to a specific person, publication, period, or event. In the process of language formation, neologisms are more mature than protologisms.\n\nNeologisms are often created by combining existing words (see compound noun and adjective) or by giving words new and unique suffixes or prefixes. Portmanteaux are combined words that are sometimes used commonly. \"Brunch\" is an example of a portmanteau word (breakfast + lunch). Lewis Carroll's \"snark\" (snake + shark) is also a portmanteau. Neologisms also can be created through abbreviation or acronym, by intentionally rhyming with existing words or simply through playing with sounds.\n\nNeologisms can become popular through memetics, by way of mass media, the Internet, and word of mouth, including academic discourse in many fields renowned for their use of distinctive jargon, and often become accepted parts of the language. Other times, however, they disappear from common use just as readily as they appeared. Whether a neologism continues as part of the language depends on many factors, probably the most important of which is acceptance by the public. It is unusual, however, for a word to enter common use if it does not resemble another word or words in an identifiable way.\n\nWhen a word or phrase is no longer \"new\", it is no longer a neologism. Neologisms may take decades to become \"old\", however. Opinions differ on exactly how old a word must be to cease being considered a neologism.\n\nPopular examples of neologism can be found in science, fiction, branding, literature, linguistic and popular culture. Examples include \"laser\" (1960) from Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation, \"robotics\" (1941), \"agitprop\" (1930).\n\nThe term \"neologism\" is first attested in English in 1772, borrowed from French \"néologisme\" (1734). A proponent of a new word or doctrine may be called a neologist. Neologists might study cultural and ethnic vernacular.\n\nThe term \"neologism\" has a broader meaning that includes not only \"an entirely new lexical item\" but also an existing word whose meaning has been altered. Sometimes, the latter process is called \"semantic shifting\", or \"semantic extension\". Neologisms are distinct from a person's \"idiolect\", one's unique patterns of vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.\n\nNeologisms are usually introduced when an individual or individuals find that a specific notion is lacking a term in a language, or when the existing vocabulary is insufficiently detailed. The law, governmental bodies, and technology have a relatively high frequency of acquiring neologisms. Another trigger that motivates neologists and protologists to coin a neologism is in order to disambiguate a previously existing term that may have been obscure or vague due to having multiple senses.\n\nNeologisms may come from a word used in the narrative of a book. Examples include \"grok\" from \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" by Robert A. Heinlein; \"McJob\" from \"\" by Douglas Coupland; \"cyberspace\" from \"Neuromancer\" by William Gibson and \"quark\" from James Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\".\n\nThe title of a book may become a neologism, for instance, \"Catch-22\" (from the title of Joseph Heller's novel). Alternatively, the author's name may give rise to the neologism, although the term is sometimes based on only one work of that author. This includes such words as \"Orwellian\" (from George Orwell, referring to his novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\") and \"Kafkaesque\" (from Franz Kafka).\n\nNames of famous characters are another source of literary neologisms, e.g. \"quixotic\" (referring to the title character in \"Don Quixote de la Mancha\" by Cervantes), \"scrooge\" (from the main character in Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol\") and \"pollyanna\" (from Eleanor H. Porter's book of the same name).\n\nCulture and technology use are major drivers in neologism development. Examples of recent pop-culture neologisms include Canadian \"Snowmageddon\", Russian \"Monstration\".\n\nIn these instances, words are used in small communities then spread through the use of social media. \"Doggo-Lingo\" specifically has spread primarily through Facebook group and Twitter account use. The suspected origin of this way of referring to dogs stems from a Facebook group created in 2008 and gaining popularity in 2014 in Australia. The Facebook group called DogSpotting posts pictures of dogs that members have seen with amusing captions, often using Doggo-Lingo. In Australian English it is common to use diminutives, often ending in –o, which could be where doggo-lingo was first used. The term has grown so that Merriam-Webster has acknowledged its use but notes the term needs to be found in published, edited work for a longer period of time before it can be deemed a new word making it the perfect example of a neologism.\n\nThe use and over-use of brand names is another example of neologism creation. The terms \"coke\" or \"cola\" may be used in reference to any Coca-Cola like beverage regardless of brand. Kleenex is used in reference to any facial tissue. Xerox or xerox-ing is used in reference to any photocopier or action of photocopying.\n\nNeologisms can also originate entirely online from social media and other forms of Internet media.\n\nBecause neologisms originate in one language, translations between languages can be difficult.\n\nIn the scientific community, where English is the predominant language for published research and studies, like-sounding translations (referred to as 'naturalization') are sometimes used. Alternatively, the English word is used along with a brief explanation of meaning.\nThe four translation methods are emphasized in order to translate neologisms: transliteration and transcription, the use of analogues, calque and loan translation.\n\nWhen translating from English to other languages, the naturalization method is most often used. The most common way that professional translators translate neologisms is through the Think aloud protocol (TAP), wherein translators find the most appropriate and natural sounding new word through speech. This way, translators are able to use potential translated neologisms in sentences and test them with different structures and syntax. Correct translations from English for specific purposes into other languages is crucial in various industries and legal systems. Inaccurate translations can lead to 'translation asymmetry' or conceptual misunderstandings which can lead to miscommunication. Many technical glossaries of English translations exist to combat this issue in the medical, judicial, and technological fields.\n\nIn psychiatry and neuroscience, the term \"neologism\" is used to describe words that have meaning only to the person who uses them, independent of their common meaning. The use of neologisms may also be due to aphasia acquired after brain damage resulting from a stroke or head injury.\n\nIn theology, a neologism refers to a relatively new doctrine (for example, Transcendentalism).\n\n"}

It can be said sometimes to be a type of urban legend, said to be passed down by older women to a younger generation. Such tales are considered superstition, folklore or unverified claims with exaggerated and/or inaccurate details. Old wives' tales often center on women's traditional concerns, such as pregnancy, puberty, social relations, health, herbalism and nutrition.\n\nIn this context, the word \"wife\" means \"woman\" rather than \"married woman\". This usage stems from Old English ' (\"woman\") and is akin to the German ' (also meaning \"woman\"). This sense of the word is still used in Modern English in constructions such as \"midwife\" and \"fishwife\".\n\nOld wives' tales are often invoked to discourage certain behaviors, usually of children, or to share knowledge of folk cures for ailments ranging from toothaches to dysentery.\n\nThe concept of old wives' tales has existed for centuries. In 1611, the King James Bible was published with the following translation of the Apostle Paul writing to his young protégé Timothy, \"But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness\" (I Timothy 4:7 KJV).\n\nOld wives' tales originate in the oral tradition of storytelling. They were generally propagated by illiterate women, telling stories to each other or to children. The stories do not attempt to moralise, but to teach lessons and make difficult concepts like death or coming of age easy for children to understand. These stories are also used to scare children so they don't do certain things.\n\nThese tales have often been collected by literate men, and turned into written works. Fairy tales by Basile, Perrault, and the Grimms have their roots in the oral tradition of women. These male writers took the stories from women, with their plucky, clever heroines and heroes, and turned them into morality tales for children.\n\nExamples of old wives' tales include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "167718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167718", "title": "Porcelain", "text": "Porcelain\n\nPorcelain () is a ceramic material made by heating materials, generally including kaolin, in a kiln to temperatures between . The toughness, strength, and translucence of porcelain, relative to other types of pottery, arises mainly from vitrification and the formation of the mineral mullite within the body at these high temperatures. Though definitions vary, porcelain can be divided into three main categories: hard-paste, soft-paste and bone china. The category that an object belongs to depends on the composition of the paste used to make the body of the porcelain object and the firing conditions.\n\nPorcelain slowly evolved in China and was finally achieved (depending on the definition used) at some point about 2,000 to 1,200 years ago, then slowly spread to other East Asian countries, and finally Europe and the rest of the world. Its manufacturing process is more demanding than that for earthenware and stoneware, the two other main types of pottery, and it has usually been regarded as the most prestigious type of pottery for its delicacy, strength, and its white colour. It combines well with both glazes and paint, and can be modelled very well, allowing a huge range of decorative treatments in tablewares, vessels and figurines. It also has many uses in technology and industry.\n\nThe European name, porcelain in English, come from the old Italian \"porcellana\" (cowrie shell) because of its resemblance to the surface of the shell. Porcelain is also referred to as china or fine china in some English-speaking countries, as it was first seen in imports from China. Properties associated with porcelain include low permeability and elasticity; considerable strength, hardness, toughness, whiteness, translucency and resonance; and a high resistance to chemical attack and thermal shock.\n\nPorcelain has been described as being \"completely vitrified, hard, impermeable (even before glazing), white or artificially coloured, translucent (except when of considerable thickness), and resonant\". However, the term \"porcelain\" lacks a universal definition and has \"been applied in an unsystematic fashion to substances of diverse kinds which have only certain surface-qualities in common\". \n\nTraditionally, East Asia only classifies pottery into low-fired wares (earthenware) and high-fired wares (often translated as porcelain), without the European concept of stoneware, which is high-fired but not generally white or translucent. Terms such as \"proto-porcelain\", \"porcellaneous\" or \"near-porcelain\" may be used in cases where the ceramic body approaches whiteness and translucency. A high proportion of modern porcelain is made of the variant bone china.\n\nKaolin is the primary material from which porcelain is made, even though clay minerals might account for only a small proportion of the whole. The word \"paste\" is an old term for both the unfired and fired materials. A more common terminology for the unfired material is \"body\"; for example, when buying materials a potter might order an amount of porcelain body from a vendor.\n\nThe composition of porcelain is highly variable, but the clay mineral kaolinite is often a raw material. Other raw materials can include feldspar, ball clay, glass, bone ash, steatite, quartz, petuntse and alabaster.\n\nThe clays used are often described as being long or short, depending on their plasticity. Long clays are cohesive (sticky) and have high plasticity; short clays are less cohesive and have lower plasticity. In soil mechanics, plasticity is determined by measuring the increase in content of water required to change a clay from a solid state bordering on the plastic, to a plastic state bordering on the liquid, though the term is also used less formally to describe the ease with which a clay may be worked. \n\nClays used for porcelain are generally of lower plasticity and are shorter than many other pottery clays. They wet very quickly, meaning that small changes in the content of water can produce large changes in workability. Thus, the range of water content within which these clays can be worked is very narrow and consequently must be carefully controlled.\n\nThe following section provides background information on the methods used to form, decorate, finish, glaze, and fire ceramic wares.\n\nUnlike their lower-fired counterparts, porcelain wares do not need glazing to render them impermeable to liquids and for the most part are glazed for decorative purposes and to make them resistant to dirt and staining. Many types of glaze, such as the iron-containing glaze used on the celadon wares of Longquan, were designed specifically for their striking effects on porcelain. Biscuit porcelain is unglazed.\n\nPorcelain wares may be decorated under the glaze using pigments that include cobalt and copper or over the glaze using coloured enamels. Like many earlier wares, modern porcelains are often biscuit-fired at around , coated with glaze and then sent for a second glaze-firing at a temperature of about or greater. Another early method is \"once-fired\", where the glaze is applied to the unfired body and the two fired together in a single operation.\n\nIn this process, \"green\" (unfired) ceramic wares are heated to high temperatures in a kiln to permanently set their shapes. Porcelain is fired at a higher temperature than earthenware so that the body can vitrify and become non-porous.\n\nPorcelain originated in China, and it took a long time to reach the modern material. Until recent times, almost all East Asian porcelain was of the hard-paste type. There is no precise date to separate the production of proto-porcelain from that of porcelain. Although proto-porcelain wares exist dating from the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BC), by the time of the Eastern Han dynasty period (206 BC–220 AD), glazed ceramic wares had developed into porcelain, which Chinese defined as high-fired ware. By the late Sui dynasty (581–618 AD) and early Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) the additional Western requirements of whiteness and translucency had been achieved, in types such as Ding ware. The wares were already exported to the Islamic world, where they were highly prized.\nEventually, porcelain and the expertise required to create it began to spread into other areas of East Asia. During the Song dynasty (960–1279 AD), artistry and production had reached new heights. The manufacture of porcelain became highly organised, and the kiln sites excavated from this period could fire as many as 25,000 wares. While Xing ware is regarded as among the greatest of the Tang dynasty porcelain, Ding ware became the premier porcelain of the Song dynasty.\n\nBy the time of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD), porcelain wares were being exported to Europe. Some of the most well-known Chinese porcelain art styles arrived in Europe during this era, such as the coveted \"blue-and-white\" wares. The Ming dynasty controlled much of the porcelain trade, which was expanded to Asia, Africa and Europe via the Silk Road. In 1517, Portuguese merchants began direct trade by sea with the Ming dynasty, and in 1598, Dutch merchants followed.\n\nSome porcelains were more highly valued than others in imperial China. The most valued types can be identified by their association with the court, either as tribute offerings, or as products of kilns under imperial supervision. Since the Yuan dynasty, the largest and best centre of production has made Jingdezhen porcelain. During the Ming dynasty, Jingdezhen porcelain become a source of imperial pride. The Yongle emperor erected a white porcelain brick-faced pagoda at Nanjing, and an exceptionally smoothly glazed type of white porcelain is peculiar to his reign. Jingdezhen porcelain's fame came to a peak during the Qing dynasty.\n\nAlthough the Japanese elite were keen importers of Chinese porcelain from early on, they were not able to make their own until the arrival of Korean potters that were taken captive during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598). They brought an improved type of kiln, and one of them spotted a source of porcelain clay near Arita, and before long several kilns had started in the region. At first their wares were similar to the cheaper and cruder Chinese porcelains with underglaze blue decoration that were already widely sold in Japan; this style was to continue for cheaper everyday wares until the 20th century.\n\nExports to Europe began around 1660, through the Chinese and the Dutch East India Company, the only Europeans allowed a trading presence. Chinese exports had been seriously disrupted by civil wars as the Ming dynasty fell apart, and the Japanese exports increased rapidly to fill the gap. At first the wares used European shapes and mostly Chinese decoration, as the Chinese had done, but gradually original Japanese styles developed. \n\nNabeshima ware was produced in kilns owned by the families of feudal lords, and were decorated in the Japanese tradition, much of it related to textile design. This was not initially exported, but used for gifts to other aristocratic families. Imari ware and Kakiemon are broad terms for styles of export porcelain with overglaze \"enamelled\" decoration begun in the early period, both with many sub-types.\n\nA great range of styles and manufacturing centres were in use by the start of the 19th century, and as Japan opened to trade in the second half, exports expanded hugely and quality generally declined. Much traditional porcelain continues to replicate older methods of production and styles, and there are several modern industrial manufacturers.\n\nThese exported Chinese porcelains were held in such great esteem in Europe that in English \"china\" became a commonly–used synonym for the Italian term \"porcelain\". The first mention of porcelain in Europe is in \"Il Milione\" by Marco Polo in XII sec. Apart from copying Chinese porcelain in \"faience\" (tin glazed earthenware), the soft-paste Medici porcelain in 16th-century Florence was the first real European attempt to reproduce it, with little success.\n\nEarly in the 16th century, Portuguese traders returned home with samples of kaolin, which they discovered in China to be essential in the production of porcelain wares. However, the Chinese techniques and composition used to manufacture porcelain were not yet fully understood. Countless experiments to produce porcelain had unpredictable results and met with failure. In the German state of Saxony, the search concluded in 1708 when Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus produced a hard, white, translucent type of porcelain specimen with a combination of ingredients, including kaolin and alabaster, mined from a Saxon mine in Colditz. It was a closely guarded trade secret of the Saxon enterprise.\n\nIn 1712, many of the elaborate Chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets were revealed throughout Europe by the French Jesuit father Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles and soon published in the \"Lettres édifiantes et curieuses de Chine par des missionnaires jésuites\". The secrets, which d'Entrecolles read about and witnessed in China, were now known and began seeing use in Europe.\n\nVon Tschirnhaus and Johann Friedrich Böttger were employed by Augustus II the Strong and worked at Dresden and Meissen in the German state of Saxony. Tschirnhaus had a wide knowledge of science and had been involved in the European quest to perfect porcelain manufacture when, in 1705, Böttger was appointed to assist him in this task. Böttger had originally been trained as a pharmacist; after he turned to alchemical research, he claimed to have known the secret of transmuting dross into gold, which attracted the attention of Augustus. Imprisoned by Augustus as an incentive to hasten his research, Böttger was obliged to work with other alchemists in the futile search for transmutation and was eventually assigned to assist Tschirnhaus. One of the first results of the collaboration between the two was the development of a red stoneware that resembled that of Yixing.\n\nA workshop note records that the first specimen of hard, white and vitrified European porcelain was produced in 1708. At the time, the research was still being supervised by Tschirnhaus; however, he died in October of that year. It was left to Böttger to report to Augustus in March 1709 that he could make porcelain. For this reason, credit for the European discovery of porcelain is traditionally ascribed to him rather than Tschirnhaus.\n\nThe Meissen factory was established in 1710 after the development of a kiln and a glaze suitable for use with Böttger's porcelain, which required firing at temperatures of up to to achieve translucence. Meissen porcelain was \"once-fired\", or \"green-fired\". It was noted for its great resistance to thermal shock; a visitor to the factory in Böttger's time reported having seen a white-hot teapot being removed from the kiln and dropped into cold water without damage. Although widely disbelieved this has been replicated in modern times.\n\nThe pastes produced by combining clay and powdered glass (frit) were called \"Frittenporzellan\" in Germany and \"frita\" in Spain. In France they were known as \"pâte tendre\" and in England as \"soft-paste\". They appear to have been given this name because they do not easily retain their shape in the wet state, or because they tend to slump in the kiln under high temperature, or because the body and the glaze can be easily scratched.\n\nExperiments at Rouen produced the earliest soft-paste in France, but the first important French soft-paste porcelain was made at the Saint-Cloud factory before 1702. Soft-paste factories were established with the Chantilly manufactory in 1730 and at Mennecy in 1750. The Vincennes porcelain factory was established in 1740, moving to larger premises at Sèvres in 1756. Vincennes soft-paste was whiter and freer of imperfections than any of its French rivals, which put Vincennes/Sèvres porcelain in the leading position in France and throughout the whole of Europe in the second half of the 18th century.\n\nDoccia porcelain of Florence was founded in 1735 and remains in production, unlike Capodimonte porcelain which was moved from Naples to Madrid by its royal owner, after producing from 1743-1759. After a gap of 15 years Naples porcelain was produced from 1771 to 1806, specializing in Neoclassical styles. All these were very successful, with large outputs of high-quality wares. In and around Venice, Francesco Vezzi was producing from around 1720 to 1735; survivals are very rare, but less so than from the Hewelke factory, which only lasted from 1758 to 1763. The Cozzi factory fared better, lasting from 1764 to 1812. The Le Nove factory produced from about 1752 to 1773, then was revived from 1781 to 1802. \n\nThe first soft-paste in England was demonstrated by Thomas Briand to the Royal Society in 1742 and is believed to have been based on the Saint-Cloud formula. In 1749, Thomas Frye took out a patent on a porcelain containing bone ash. This was the first bone china, subsequently perfected by Josiah Spode.\n\nIn the twenty-five years after Briand's demonstration, a number of factories were founded in England to make soft-paste table-wares and figures:\n\n\nWilliam Cookworthy discovered deposits of kaolin in Cornwall, making a considerable contribution to the development of porcelain and other whiteware ceramics in the United Kingdom. Cookworthy's factory at Plymouth, established in 1768, used kaolin and china stone to make porcelain with a body composition similar to that of the Chinese porcelains of the early 18th century.\n\nHard-paste porcelain came from East Asia, specifically China, and some of the finest quality porcelain wares are from this category. The earliest European porcelains were produced at the Meissen factory in the early 18th century; they were formed from a paste composed of kaolin and alabaster and fired at temperatures up to in a wood-fired kiln, producing a porcelain of great hardness, translucency, and strength. Later, the composition of the Meissen hard paste was changed and the alabaster was replaced by feldspar and quartz, allowing the pieces to be fired at lower temperatures. Kaolinite, feldspar and quartz (or other forms of silica) continue to constitute the basic ingredients for most continental European hard-paste porcelains.\n\nSoft-paste porcelains date back from the early attempts by European potters to replicate Chinese porcelain by using mixtures of clay and frit. Soapstone and lime were known to have been included in these compositions. These wares were not yet actual porcelain wares as they were not hard nor vitrified by firing kaolin clay at high temperatures. As these early formulations suffered from high pyroplastic deformation, or slumping in the kiln at high temperatures, they were uneconomic to produce and of low quality. \n\nFormulations were later developed based on kaolin with quartz, feldspars, nepheline syenite or other feldspathic rocks. These were technically superior, and continue to be produced. Soft-paste porcelains are fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain, therefore these wares are generally less hard than hard-paste porcelains.\n\nAlthough originally developed in England in 1748 in order to compete with imported porcelain, bone china is now made worldwide. The English had read the letters of Jesuit missionary Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles, which described Chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets in detail. One writer has speculated that a misunderstanding of the text could possibly have been responsible for the first attempts to use bone-ash as an ingredient of English porcelain, although this is not supported by researchers and historians. \n\nIn China, kaolin was sometimes described as forming the 'bones' of the paste, while the 'flesh' was provided by the refined rocks suitable for the porcelain body. Traditionally, English bone china was made from two parts of bone-ash, one part of kaolin and one part china stone, although this has largely been replaced by feldspars from non-UK sources.\n\nPorcelain and other ceramic materials have many applications in engineering, especially ceramic engineering. Porcelain is an excellent insulator for use at high voltage, especially in outdoor applications, see Insulator (electricity)#Material. Examples include: terminals for high-voltage cables, bushings of power transformers, insulation of high frequency antennas and many other components.\n\nPorcelain can be used as a building material, usually in the form of tiles or large rectangular panels. Modern porcelain tiles are generally produced by a number of recognised international standards and definitions. Manufacturers are found across the world with Italy being the global leader, producing over 380 million square metres in 2006. Historic examples of rooms decorated entirely in porcelain tiles can be found in several European palaces including ones at Galleria Sabauda in Turin, Museo di Doccia in Sesto Fiorentino, Museo di Capodimonte in Naples, the Royal Palace of Madrid and the nearby Royal Palace of Aranjuez. and the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing. \n\nMore recent noteworthy examples include the Dakin Building in Brisbane, California, and the Gulf Building in Houston, Texas, which when constructed in 1929 had a porcelain logo on its exterior. A more detailed description of the history, manufacture and properties of porcelain tiles is given in the article “Porcelain Tile: The Revolution Is Only Beginning.”\n\nBecause of its durability, inability to rust and impermeability, glazed porcelain has been in use for personal hygiene since at least the third quarter of the 17th century. During this period, porcelain chamber pots were commonly found in higher-class European households, and the term \"bourdaloue\" was used as the name for the pot.\n\nHowever bath tubs are not made of porcelain, but of porcelain enamel on a metal base, usually of cast iron. Porcelain enamel is a marketing term used in the US, and is not porcelain but vitreous enamel.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Between 1971 and 1983, Hansen abducted, raped, and murdered at least 17 women in and around Anchorage, Alaska, hunting them down in the wilderness with a Ruger Mini-14 and a knife. He was arrested and convicted in 1983 and was sentenced to 461 years and a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n\nRobert Hansen was born in Estherville, Iowa, in 1939. He was the son of a Danish immigrant and followed in his father's footsteps as a baker. In his youth, he was skinny and painfully shy, afflicted with a stutter and severe acne that left him permanently scarred. Shunned by the attractive girls in school, he grew up hating them and nursing fantasies of cruel revenge. Throughout childhood and adolescence, Hansen was described as being quiet and a loner and he had an unhealthy relationship with his domineering father. He started to practice both hunting and archery and often found refuge in these pastimes.\n\nIn 1957, Hansen enlisted in the United States Army Reserve and served for one year before being discharged. He later worked as an assistant drill instructor at a police academy in Pocahontas, Iowa. There, he began a relationship with a younger woman. He married her in the summer of 1960.\n\nOn December 7, 1960, he was arrested for burning down a Pocahontas County Board of Education school bus garage, for which he served 20 months of a three-year prison sentence in Anamosa State Penitentiary. His wife filed for divorce while he was incarcerated. Over the next few years, he was jailed several times for petty theft. In 1967, he moved to Anchorage, Alaska, with his second wife, whom he had married in 1963 and with whom he had two children. In Anchorage, he was well liked by his neighbors and set several local hunting records.\n\nOn June 13, 1983, 17-year-old Cindy Paulson escaped from Hansen, while he was trying to load her into his Piper Super Cub. She told police he had offered her $200 to perform oral sex but that, when she got into the car, he pulled a gun on her and drove her to his home in Muldoon. There, he held her captive, torturing, raping and sexually assaulting her. She mentioned that, after he chained her by the neck to a post in the house's basement, Hansen took a nap on a nearby couch.\n\nWhen he awoke, he put her in his car and took her to Merrill Field airport, where he told her that he intended to \"take her out to his cabin\" (a shack in the Knik River area of the Matanuska Valley accessible only by boat or bush plane). Paulson, crouched in the back seat of the car with her wrists cuffed in front of her body, waited to escape until Hansen was busy loading the airplane's cockpit. While Hansen's back was turned, Paulson crawled out of the back seat, opened the driver's side door and ran toward nearby Sixth Avenue.\n\nShe later told police that she had left her blue sneakers on the passenger side floor of the sedan's backseat, as evidence that she had been in the car. Hansen panicked and chased her, but Paulson made it to Sixth Avenue first and managed to flag down a passing truck. The driver, Robert Yount, alarmed by her disheveled appearance, stopped and picked her up. He drove her to the Mush Inn, where she jumped out of the truck and ran inside. While she pleaded with the clerk to phone her boyfriend at the Big Timber Motel, the truck driver continued on to work, where he called the police to report the barefoot, handcuffed woman.\n\nWhen Anchorage Police Department officers arrived at the Mush Inn, they were told that the young woman had taken a cab to the Big Timber Motel. APD officers arrived at Room 110 of the Big Timber Motel and found Cindy Paulson, still handcuffed and alone. She was taken to APD headquarters, where she described the perpetrator. Hansen, when questioned by APD officers, denied the accusation, stating that Paulson was just trying to cause some trouble because he would not pay her extortion demands. Although Hansen had several prior run-ins with the law, his meek demeanour and humble occupation as a baker, along with a strong alibi from his friend John Henning, kept him from being considered as a serious suspect and the case went cold.\n\nDetective Glenn Flothe of the Alaska State Troopers had been part of a team investigating the discovery of several bodies in and around Anchorage, Seward and the Matanuska-Susitna Valley area. The first of the bodies was found by construction workers near Eklutna Road. The body, dubbed \"Eklutna Annie\" by investigators, has never been identified. Later that year, the body of Joanna Messina was discovered in a gravel pit near Seward and in 1982, the remains of 23-year-old Sherry Morrow were discovered, in a shallow grave near the Knik River. Flothe now had three bodies and what looked like one killer.\n\nHe contacted Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Roy Hazelwood and requested help with a criminal psychological profile, based on the three recovered bodies. Hazelwood thought that the killer would be an experienced hunter with low self-esteem, have a history of being rejected by women and would feel compelled to keep \"souvenirs\" of his murders, such as a victim's jewelry. He also suggested that the assailant might stutter. Using this profile, Flothe investigated possible suspects until he reached Hansen, who fit the profile and owned a plane.\n\nSupported by Paulson's testimony and Hazelwood's profile, Flothe and the APD secured a warrant to search Hansen's plane, cars and home. On October 27, 1983, investigators uncovered jewelry belonging to some of the missing women, as well as an array of firearms in a corner hideaway of Hansen's attic. Also found was an aviation map with little \"x\" marks on it, hidden behind Hansen's headboard.\n\nWhen confronted with the evidence found in his home, Hansen denied it as long as he could but he eventually began to blame the women and tried to justify his motives. Eventually, confessing to each item of evidence as it was presented to him, he admitted to a spree of attacks against Alaskan women starting in 1971. Hansen's earliest victims were young women, usually between 16 and 19 and not sex workers, unlike the victims who led to his discovery.\n\nHansen is known to have raped and assaulted over 30 Alaskan women. He is also responsible for murdering at least 17, ranging in age from 16 to 41. They were:\n\nOf these 17 women, Hansen was only formally charged with the murder of four - Sherry Morrow, Joanna Messina, Eklutna Annie and Paula Goulding. He was also charged with the kidnapping and rape of Cindy Paulson.\n\nOnce arrested, Hansen was charged with assault, kidnapping, multiple weapons offenses, and theft and insurance fraud. The last charge was related to a claim filed with the insurance company over alleged theft of some trophies, whose funds he used to purchase the Super Cub. At trial, he claimed he later recovered the trophies in his backyard but forgot to inform the insurer.\n\nOnly after ballistics tests returned a match between bullets found at the crime scenes and Hansen's rifle, did he enter into a plea bargain. He pleaded guilty to the four homicides the police had evidence for (Morrow, Messina, Goulding and Eklutna Annie) and provided details about his other victims, in return for serving his sentence in a federal prison, along with no publicity in the press. Another condition of the plea bargain was his participation in deciphering the markings on his aviation map and locating his victims' bodies. He confirmed the police theory of how the women were abducted, adding that he would sometimes let a potential victim go if she convinced him that she wouldn't report him to police. He indicated that he began killing in the early 1970s.\n\nHe showed investigators 17 grave sites, in and around Southcentral Alaska, 12 of which were unknown to investigators. There remained marks on his map that he refused to give up, including three in Resurrection Bay, near Seward (authorities suspect two of these marks belong to the graves of Mary Thill and Megan Emrick, whom Hansen has denied killing). The remains of 12 (of a probable 21) victims were exhumed by the police and returned to their families. Hansen was sentenced by jury to 461 years plus life in prison, without the possibility of parole. He was first imprisoned at the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1988, he was returned to Alaska and briefly incarcerated at Lemon Creek Correctional Center in Juneau. He was also imprisoned at Spring Creek Correctional Center in Seward until May 2014, when he was transported to the Anchorage Correctional Complex for health reasons.\n\nHansen died at the age of 75, at Alaska Regional Hospital in Anchorage on August 21, 2014, due to undisclosed, lingering health conditions.\n\n\nDocumentaries:\n\nTV series:\n\n\n"}

It is a branch of animal husbandry. Sheep are raised principally for their meat (lamb and mutton), milk (sheep's milk), and fiber (wool). They also yield sheepskin and parchment.\n\nSheep can be raised in range of temperate climates, including arid zones. Farmers build fences, housing, shearing sheds and other facilities on their property, such as for water, feed, transport and pest control. Most farms are managed so sheep can graze pastures, sometimes under the control of a shepherd or sheep dog.\n\nThe major sources of income for a farm will come from the sale of lambs and the shearing of sheep for their wool. Farmers can select from various breeds suitable for their region and market conditions. When the farmer sees that a ewe (female adult) is showing signs of heat or estrus, they can organise for mating with males. Newborn lambs are typically subject to tail docking and males may be castrated.\n\nAccording to the FAOSTAT database of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the top five countries by number of heads of sheep (average from 1993 to 2013) were: mainland China (146.5 million heads), Australia (101.1 million), India (62.1 million), Iran (51.7 million), and the former Sudan (46.2 million).\n\nIn 2013, the five countries with the largest number of heads of sheep were mainland China (175 million), Australia (75.5 million), India (53.8 million), the former Sudan (52.5 million), and Iran (50.2 million). In 2013, the number of heads of sheep were distributed as follows: 44% in Asia, 28.2% in Africa; 11.2% in Europe, 9.1% in Oceania, 7.4% in the Americas.\n\nThe top producers of sheep meat (average from 1993 to 2013) were as follows: mainland China (1.6 million); Australia (618,000), New Zealand (519,000), the United Kingdom (335,000), and Turkey (288,857). The top five producers of sheep meat in 2013 were mainland China (2 million), Australia (660,000), New Zealand (450,000), the former Sudan (325,000), and Turkey (295,000).\n\nIn the United States, inventory data on sheep began in 1867, when 45 million head of sheep were counted in the United States. The numbers of sheep peaked in 1884 at 51 million head, and then declined over time to almost 6 million head.\n\nSince the 1960s, per capita consumption of lamb and mutton declined from nearly 5 pounds to just about 1 pound, due to competition from poultry, pork, beef, and other meats. Since the 1990s, U.S. sheep operations declined from around 105,000 to around 80,000 due to shrinking revenues and low rates of return. According to the Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, the \"sheep industry accounts for less than 1 percent of U.S. livestock industry receipts.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Uri drawings are strongly linear and do not have deep perspective; they do, however, balance positive and negative space. Designs are frequently asymmetrical, and are often painted spontaneously. \"Uri\" generally is not sacred, apart from those images painted on the walls of shrines and created in conjunction with some community rituals.\n\nThe drawing of \"uri\" was once practiced throughout most of Igboland, although by 1970 it had lost much of its popularity, and was being kept alive by a handful of contemporary artists. It was usually practiced by women, who would decorate each other's bodies with dark dyes to prepare for village events, such as marriage, title taking, and funerals; designs would sometimes be produced for the most important market days as well. Designs would last about a week.\n\nMost \"uri\" designs were named, and many differed among various Igbo regions. Some were abstract, using patterns such as zigzags and concentric circles, while others stood for household objects like stools and pots. Some represented animals such as pythons and lizards; others showed plants, like yam leaves, or heavenly bodies, including a crescent moon and stars. Still other designs depicted cutting and other actions.\n\nThe use of \"uri\" was not limited to the human body. Igbo women would also paint murals of designs on the walls of compounds and houses. These generally used four colors which could be created from natural bases easily found in the area; black was made from charcoal, reddish brown from the camwood tree, yellow from either soil or tree bark, and white from clay. When the British invaded the area at the turn of the twentieth century, they brought with them a commercial laundry additive which some painters used to create blue pigment. \"Uri\" was not only meant to express a specific message. It was also meant to beautify the female body and buildings to which it was applied, as beauty is equated with morality in Igbo culture.\n\nToday the practice of \"uri\" is being kept alive by, among others, Anam people who continues to pass the knowledge and use the culture and the artists of the Nsukka group, who have appropriated its designs and incorporated them into other media.\n\n"}
{"id": "4927911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4927911", "title": "Volver", "text": "Volver\n\nVolver (, meaning \"to go back\") is a 2006 Spanish drama film written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar. Headed by actress Penélope Cruz, the film features an ensemble cast also starring Carmen Maura, Lola Dueñas, Blanca Portillo, Yohana Cobo, and Chus Lampreave. Revolving around an eccentric family of women from a wind-swept region south of Madrid, Cruz plays Raimunda, a working-class woman forced to go to great lengths to protect her 14-year-old daughter Paula. To top off the family crisis, her mother Irene comes back from the dead to tie up loose ends.\n\nThe plot originates in Almodóvar's earlier film \"The Flower of My Secret\" (1995), where it features as a novel which is rejected for publication but is stolen to form the screenplay of a film named \"The Freezer\". Drawing inspiration from the Italian neorealism of the late 1940s to early 1950s and the work of pioneering directors such as Federico Fellini, Luchino Visconti, and Pier Paolo Pasolini, \"Volver\" addresses themes like sexual abuse, loneliness and death, mixing the genres of farce, tragedy, melodrama, and magic realism. Set in the La Mancha region, Almodovar's place of birth, the filmmaker cited his upbringing as a major influence on many aspects of the plot and the characters.\n\n\"Volver\" premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or. It received critical acclaim and ultimately won two awards at the festival, for Best Actress (shared by the six main actresses) and Best Screenplay. The film's Spanish premiere was held on 10 March 2006 in Puertollano, Spain, where the filming had taken place. Cruz was nominated for the 2006 Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the first Spanish woman ever to be nominated in that category.\n\nRaimunda (Penélope Cruz) and Sole (Lola Dueñas) are sisters who grew up in Alcanfor de las Infantas, a small village in La Mancha, but now both live in Madrid. Their parents had died in a fire three years before.\n\nSole returns for the funeral of her elderly, dementia-stricken Aunt Paula (Chus Lampreave). Aunt Paula's neighbour Agustina (Blanca Portillo) confesses to Sole that she has heard Paula talking to the ghost of their mother Irene (Carmen Maura). Sole encounters the ghost herself, and when she returns to Madrid, she discovers that the ghost has stowed away in the trunk of her car. Sole agrees to let Irene stay with her: Sole operates a hair salon in her apartment, and Irene will assist her. Irene says that she wants to know why Raimunda hates her, and why she herself is afraid to reveal herself to Raimunda.\n\nMeanwhile, Raimunda and her daughter Paula (Yohana Cobo) have a different death to cope with. Paula's father Paco (Antonio de la Torre) attempts to rape her, claiming that he is not really her father, and Paula stabs him in self-defense. Raimunda hides the corpse in the deep-freezer of a nearby restaurant with an absent owner, Emilio (Carlos Blanco). When members of a film crew happen upon the restaurant, Raimunda strikes a deal to cater for them, and finds herself back in the restaurant business.\n\nRaimunda reveals to Paula that Paco was not her biological father, and promises to tell her the whole story later. Agustina is diagnosed with terminal cancer and goes to Madrid for treatment. Raimunda visits her in the hospital. Agustina asks Raimunda if she has seen her mother's ghost. Agustina hopes that the ghost will be able to tell her about her own mother, who disappeared three years before. Raimunda leaves Paula with Sole, rents a van and transports the freezer to a convenient spot by the river Júcar. While staying in Sole's apartment, Paula meets her grandmother's ghost and grows close to her. The next night, Agustina comes to the restaurant, and Raimunda reveals two startling secrets: her father and Agustina's mother were having an affair, and Agustina's mother disappeared on the same day that Raimunda's parents died.\n\nSole tells Raimunda that she has seen their mother's ghost, who is in the next room with Paula. Irene admits that she did not, in fact, die in the fire, and reveals the whole truth. The reason for Raimunda and Irene's estrangement is that Raimunda's father sexually abused her, resulting in the birth of Paula; thus, Paula is Raimunda's daughter and her sister. Irene tells Raimunda that she did not know about the abuse until Aunt Paula told her about it, and never forgave herself for failing to stop it.\n\nIrene explains that she found her husband in bed with another woman and started the fire that killed them both. The ashes that had been presumed to be Irene's were, in fact, the ashes of Agustina's mother, the woman with whom Irene's husband was having an affair. After the fire, Irene wandered for several days in the countryside, until she decided that she wanted to turn herself in. But first, she wanted to say goodbye to Paula, who had lost the ability to look after herself and with whom Irene had been living prior to setting the fire. Paula welcomed Irene home as if nothing had happened, and Irene stayed, caring for her sister and expecting that the police would come soon to arrest her. Due to the superstitious and closed nature of the community, however, the police never came and the residents, accustomed to tales of the dead returning, explained the rare sightings of Irene as \"un fantasma\", a ghost.\n\nThe family reunites at Aunt Paula's house. Irene reveals her presence to Agustina, who believes her to be a ghost. Irene pledges to stay in the village and care for Agustina as her cancer worsens, saying to Raimunda that it was the least that she could do after killing Agustina's mother. Raimunda visits her mother at Agustina's house, and the two embrace and promise to repair their relationship.\n\n\n\"Volver\" was first developed by Pedro Almodóvar, based on a story actress Marisa Paredes told him during the production of their 1995 film \"The Flower of My Secret\", another film set in the La Mancha region. The story revolved around a heartbroken Puerto Rican man who opts to kill his mother-in-law in hopes of reuniting with his beloved wife, who left him and broke off contact, at her mother's funeral. Owning a restaurant, he leaves it in his neighbour's care, when he is about to kill his victim. Fascinated by the story and its background, Almodóvar decided on incorporating elements of it into the screenplay of \"The Flower of My Secret\", making it the plot of a movie-within-the-movie based on the main character's novel in the film. While working on the script for \"Volver\", he would however settle on outlining the role of the neighbour Raimunda, as the film's central character, while Emilio, the Puerto Rican, eventually became a supporting role only.\n\nAlmodóvar says of the story that \"it is precisely about death...More than about death itself, the screenplay talks about the rich culture that surrounds death in the region of La Mancha, where I was born. It is about the way (not tragic at all) in which various female characters, of different generations, deal with this culture\".\n\nPenélope Cruz was the first reported to have landed one of the starring roles in \"Volver\", having previously worked with Almodóvar on his films \"Live Flesh\" (1997) and \"All About My Mother\" (1999). In preparing for her role, the actress watched Italian neorealism films from the 1950s, many of them starring Sophia Loren and Claudia Cardinale, to study \"the Italian \"maggiorate\"\" that Almodóvar envisioned for her performance in the film. Cruz, who had to wear a prosthetic bottom while filming, noted the role of Raimunda as \"the best gift an actress can get\".\n\nCarmen Maura, the star of Almodóvar's debut \"Pepi, Luci, Bom\" (1980) and five additional films with the director, was the first to be cast in the film alongside Cruz. Her engagement marked her first collaboration with Almodóvar after a period of 18 years and a reported fallout during the production of \"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\" (1989). Maura commented on the \"borderline character\" of Irene as a \"very complicated [role to play]\".\n\nThe tango \"Volver\" by Carlos Gardel with lyrics by Alfredo Le Pera is converted to flamenco and is sung in the movie with the voice of Estrella Morente and lip synced by Penélope Cruz. The dance tune playing at the party prior to Raimunda's lip syncing is called \"Good Thing\" by the British three-piece indie-dance combo Saint Etienne.\n\nIn the US alone, the film had made $12,897,993 (15.4% of total) at the box office after 26.4 weeks of release in 689 theatres. The box office figure from the rest of the world is somewhere in the region of $71,123,059 (84.6% of total) according to Box Office Mojo. The total worldwide gross is estimated at $84,021,052.\n\nAs of 22 January 2007 the film had grossed $12,241,181 at the Spanish box office.\n\n\"Fotogramas\", Spain's top film magazine, gave it a five-star rating. Upon its U.S. release, A. O. Scott made it an \"NYT Critics' Pick\" and wrote:\nTo relate the details of the narrative—death, cancer, betrayal, parental abandonment, more death—would create an impression of dreariness and woe. But nothing could be further from the spirit of \"Volver\" which is buoyant without being flip, and consoling without ever becoming maudlin. Mr. Almodóvar acknowledges misfortune—and takes it seriously—from a perspective that is essentially comic. Very few filmmakers have managed to smile so convincingly in the face of misery and fatality: Jean Renoir and Billy Wilder come immediately to mind, and Mr. Almodóvar, if he is not yet their equal, surely belongs in their company. \"Volver\" is often dazzling in its artifice—José Luis Alcaine's ripe cinematography, Alberto Iglesias's suave, heart-tugging score— but it is never false. It draws you in, invites you to linger and makes you eager to return.\n\nRoger Ebert gave it his top rating of (four stars out of 4), calling it \"enchanting, gentle, transgressive\" and notes \"Almodovar is above all a director who loves women—young, old, professional, amateur, mothers, daughters, granddaughters, dead, alive. Here his cheerful plot combines life after death with the concealment of murder, success in the restaurant business, the launching of daughters and with completely serendipitous solutions to (almost) everyone's problems\".\n\nAs of 2015, the film has a \"Certified Fresh\" rating from critics at Rotten Tomatoes, scoring a 92% based on 148 \"fresh\" reviews out of 161 critics, with the general consensus being \"\"Volver\" catches director Pedro Almodóvar and star Penélope Cruz at the peak of their respective powers, in service of a layered, thought-provoking film\".\n\nThe film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2006.\n\nGeneral top ten\n\n\"Volver\" received a standing ovation when it was screened as part of the official selection at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, and won the Best Screenplay award as well as the award for Best Actress — which was shared by the six stars of the film.\n\nCruz was nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards, BAFTAs and Screen Actors Guild Awards. The film won the National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It received two nominations at the 63rd Golden Globe Awards: Best Actress for Penélope Cruz as well as Best Foreign Language Film.\n\n\n"}

This can include women filling behind the scene roles such as director, cinematographer, writer, and producer while also addressing the stories of women and character development through screenplays.\n\nRenowned female directors include Kathryn Bigelow, who is the only woman to receive an academy award for best director, along with many other women directors from around the world such as Mary Harron, Jane Campion, Sofia Coppola, and Catherine Hardwicke. Many successful cinematographers are also women, including Maryse Alberti, Reed Morano and Zoe White. \n\nWomen's cinema recognizes women's contributions all over the world, not only to narrative films but to documentaries as well. Recognizing the work of women occurs through various festivals and awards, such as the Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\"Women's cinema is a complex, critical, theoretical, and institutional construction\", Alison Butler explains. The concept has had its fair share of criticisms, causing some female filmmakers to distance themselves from it in fear of be associated with marginalization and ideological controversy.\n\nAlice Guy-Blaché was a film pioneer and likely the first female director. Working for the Gaumont Film Company in France at the time that the cinema was being invented, she created \"La Fée aux Choux\" (1896). The dates of many early films are speculative, but \"La Fée aux Choux\" may well be the first narrative film ever released. She served as Gaumont's head of production from 1896 to 1906 and ultimately produced hundreds of silent films in France and the United States.\n\nAmerican-born director, Lois Weber was coached and inspired by Guy-Blaché and found success in creating silent films. Weber is well known for her films \"Hypocrites\" (1915), \"The Blot\" (1921), and \"Suspense\" (1913). Weber's films often focus on difficult social issues. For instance, her film \"Where Are My Children? (1916)\" addresses the controversial issues of birth control and abortion. And she questioned the validity of capital punishment in \"The People vs. John Doe\" (1916).\n\nMabel Normand was another significant early female filmmaker. She started as an actress and became a producer-writer-director in the 1910s, working on the first shorts Charlie Chaplin did as The Tramp at Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios. She further collaborated with Sennett on other Keystone films and, during the late 1910s and early 1920s, she had her own movie studio and production company.\n\nWomen screenwriters were highly sought after in the early years of the cinema. Frances Marion, Anita Loos, and June Mathis all had successful careers in the silent and early-sound eras. Mathis was also the first female executive in Hollywood.\n\nIn Sweden, Anna Hofman-Uddgren was that country's first female film maker—producing the silent film \"Stockholmsfrestelser\" in 1911. She also acted in the film.\n\nAs the American cinema became a highly commercialized industry in the 1920s and its content became more and more conventionalized, the opportunities for women producers and directors became fewer and fewer. By the time sound arrived in the US in 1927 and the years immediately after, women's roles behind the camera were largely limited to scriptwriters, costume designers, set decorators, make-up artists, and the like. And the industry's implementation of self-censorship in the form of the Hays Code in 1934 meant that topics such as birth control and abortion were taboo. Dorothy Arzner was the only woman director to survive in this unfriendly environment. She did so by producing well made but formally rather conventional films. Nevertheless, it is possible to trace feminist elements in her films. Film critics find her film, \"Dance, Girl, Dance\", about two women struggling to make it in show business, to be particularly interesting from a feminist perspective. When the film was selected for inclusion in the National Film Registry, it was noted that \"The dancers, played by Maureen O'Hara and Lucille Ball, strive to preserve their own feminist integrity, while fighting for their place in the spotlight and for the love of male lead Louis Hayward.\" Beyond \"Dance, Girl, Dance\", Arzner also worked with some of Hollywood's most formidable actresses—including Katharine Hepburn in \"Christopher Strong\" (1933) and Joan Crawford in \"The Bride Wore Red\" (1937).\n\nThe experimental and avant-garde cinema is the genre considered to be closer to women filmmakers and one that also advances women themes. Annette Kuhn, for instance, noted such special affinity by citing that low investments of money and 'professionalism' have meant that it is more open than the mainstream film industry for women. Both Pam Cook and Laura Mulvey also noted an alignment and alliance of experimental and avant-garde cinema with feminist interest and feminist politics. Specifically, Mulvey explained that mainstream or Hollywood films are unable to provide the experience of contradiction, reinforcing anti-realism and, this is where the avant-garde cinema is useful for women and feminism because they share \"a common interest in the politics of images and problems of aesthetic language.\"\n\nWomen's involvement in the experimental and avant-garde cinema started in the early twentieth century, although it was limited due to the constraints of the social conventions of this period. It was only after the war when women became actively involved in this cinematic genre. Germaine Dulac was a leading member of the French avant-garde film movement after World War I. There is also the case of Maya Deren's visionary films, which belonged to the classics of experimental cinema and focused on the North-American avant-garde. The contemporaneous trend did not oppose the female filmmakers' entry into avant-garde filmmaking although, in its early years, they did not receive as much critical acclaim as their male counterparts.\n\nShirley Clarke was a leading figure of the independent American film scene in New York in the fifties. Her work is unusual, insofar as she directed outstanding experimental and feature films as well as documentaries. Joyce Wieland was a Canadian experimental film maker. The National Film Board of Canada allowed many women to produce non-commercial animation films. In Europe women artists like Valie Export were among the first to explore the artistic and political potential of videos.\n\nIn the late sixties, when the second wave of feminism started, the New Left was at its height. Both movements strongly opposed the 'dominant cinema', i.e. Hollywood and male European bourgeois auteur cinema. Hollywood was accused of furthering oppression by disseminating sexist, racist and imperialist stereotypes. Women participated in mixed new collectives like Newsreel, but they also formed their own film groups. Early feminist films often focused on personal experiences. A first masterpiece was \"Wanda\" by Barbara Loden, one of the most poignant portraits of alienation ever made.\n\nSecond-wave feminism would reveal itself in different forms in films in the latter part of the 20th century such as with the idea of \"sisterhoods\" in movies, a good example of which is \"Steel Magnolias\" in 1989. Other concepts of second-wave feminism in films involved women's oppression and the difficulty in identifying with the idea of femininity. During this time, feminism in movies would also be represented as a counter-cinema whereby filmmakers would attempt to intentionally deconstruct the model of the classical film. This style of feminist counter-cinema can be seen in the works of artists such as Sally Potter's \"Thriller\" in 1979.\n\nResisting the oppression of female sexuality was one of the core goals of second-wave feminism. Abortion was still very controversial in many western societies and feminists opposed the control of the state and the church. Exploring female sexuality took many forms: focusing on long-time censured forms of sexuality (lesbianism, sado-masochism) or showing heterosexuality from a woman's point of view.\nBirgit Hein, Elfi Mikesch, Nelly Kaplan, Catherine Breillat and Barbara Hammer are some of the directors to be remembered.\n\nA film notable for its empathic portrayal of sex work is Lizzie Borden's \"Working Girls\" (1986). Molly, a white lesbian in a stable mixed-race relationship, is a Yale-educated photographer who has chosen to augment her income through sex work in a low-key urban brothel. We accompany Molly on what turns out to be her last day on the job, understanding her professional interactions with her \"johns\" through her perspective, a completely original point of view, since, until Borden's film, sex workers had largely been depicted stereotypically. The story's sympathetic, well-rounded character and situation humanizes sex work, and the film itself combats the anti-pornography stance touted by many second-wave feminists, which Borden rejects as repressive.\n\nTypically women are portrayed as dependent on other characters, over-emotional, and confined to low status jobs when compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey & Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and definitely under represented. The roles that men play are the superhero, the wealthy business man or the all-powerful villain. When it comes to the roles females play they tend to be the housewife, the woman who can't obtain a man, the slut, or the secretary. The true comparison is masculinity versus femininity. The Bechdel test for film is a type of litmus test that examines the representation of women in media. The 3 factors tested are: 1. Are there at least 2 women in the film who have names? 2. Do those women talk to each other? 3. Do they talk to each other about something other than a man? (Sharma & Sender, 2014). Many roles that are given to women make them either dependent on the male counterpart or limits their role. Another characteristic of their role placement is that women are twice as likely to have a life-related role rather than a work-related role. Hollywood rarely chooses to have women be the all-powerful boss or to even have a successful career. There have been some examples that break this norm, such as \"The Proposal\" or \"I Don't Know How She Does It\". Even in these two films, the male counterpart is a strong role and in both the female lead is reliant on both actors for the storyline. Women do not stand on their own in movies and rarely are the center of attention without a male being there to steal the limelight. Some roles that have been portrayed in recent films have worked against this norm, such as Katniss in \"Hunger Games\" and Furiosa in \"\". These roles break the norm, as women typically are portrayed as dependent on other characters, over-emotional, and confined to low-status jobs compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey & Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and underrepresented.\n\nMany women fear(ed) even entering the film industry, let alone produce multiple pieces of work in the industry. It is said that both male and female workers believe hiring women into the industry is taking a big chance, or being risky. There are many discriminatory acts toward women during the hiring process into the industry such as age discrimination and providing them with lower pay rates. Most women workers in the film industry only become freelancers, which in most cases prevents them from creating careers and making a living out of their film/cinematography passion. (Wing-Fai, 2015). These are the fear tactics in place, whether purposely or not, to prevent women from thriving in the film industry.\n\nHowever, there is much more gendered discrimination towards women after they receive the job and actually begin to help and/or produce work. Statistics show that there is not many women in senior positions in the industry. Compared to the amount of women hired, it is clearly shown that women are not given the chance to keep their jobs for long periods of time. “However, it is notable that women lost their jobs at a rate that was six times that of men, indicating the particular and heightened vulnerability of women in the industry.” Women are not being promoted into higher positions as often as their male counterparts and are not even given the chance to stay long enough to get promoted. These are multiple issues happening during the hiring process and even the post-hire experiences of women which may make other women fear entering the industry in the first place.\n\nThe way women are treated in the workplace are also evidence of the inequalities against them in the film industry. Women’s pay rates and expectations in their background/experience in cinematography is much different than male workers. There are many scenarios in the industry that displays the woman with more qualifications for the job than the man, yet earns less money for the same job than the man. “It is worth noting that women in this field are significantly better qualified than their male counterparts, with a greater proportion being graduates and an even more significant difference in the numbers of women, compared to men, with higher degrees (Skillset, 2010a: 6).” Even the women who are overqualified are treated as if they are not, resulting in them working extra hard to become better and be rewarded as their male counterparts. All of these inequalities and discrimination toward women in the film industry creates a fear for women to even want to enter the industry.\n\nResisting patriarchal violence was a key concern of second-wave feminism during the 1960s to the 1980s. Consequently, many feminists of the second wave have taken part in the peace movements of the eighties, as had their foremothers in the older pacifist movements. The effects that war conflict had on women following the cold war was often overlooked. Post cold-war conflicts resulted in women being subjected to increased forms of torture, rape, and violence. This caused an increase in women’s peace organizations and initiatives to protest violence against women, resulting in more criticism of the patriarchal cliché of the 'peaceable' woman. Women film directors documented the participation of women in anti-imperialist resistance movements. Inspired by the Hindu goddess Mother Kali--who is traditionally associated with sexuality, violence, and motherly-tenderness-- German filmmakers Birgit and Wilhelm Hein created their Kali Film, which depicts women as violent and threatening, the opposite of the innocent “caretaker” stereotype generally assigned to women characters. The filmmakers assembled found footage from 'trivial' genres, the only domain of cinema in which the portrayal of aggressive women was allowed. \n\nFilmmakers have also begun to take on representations of sexuality and gender in films directed specifically at college students. As campus sexual assault continues to pervade universities, filmmakers have started to create films that address these issues. In 2014 a group of students and faculty at Texas Tech University created the film series “Sexism | Cinema,” to provide education on violence against women and sexual abuse on college campuses. In 2015, the films were screened and over 500 students were in attendance.\n\nKathryn Bigelow works in male-dominated genres like science fiction, action and horror. She became the first woman to win an Academy Award for Best Director and the Directors Guild of America Award in 2010 for \"The Hurt Locker\". In 2013, her film \"Zero Dark Thirty\" was met with universal acclaim and grossed $95 million in the United States box office. Bigelow went on to be nominated for Best Director at the BAFTA Awards, Golden Globe Awards and Directors Guild of America Award among others. However, she failed to be shortlisted for the category at the 85th Academy Awards in what was widely seen as a snub.\n\nAnne Fletcher has directed four studio-financed films: \"Step Up\" (2006), \"27 Dresses\" (2008), \"The Proposal\" (2009) and \"The Guilt Trip\" (2012) which have gone on to gross over $343 million at the US box office and $632 million worldwide. She is also attached to direct the sequel to the 2007 film \"Enchanted\".\n\nCatherine Hardwicke's films have grossed a cumulative total of $551.8 million. Her most successful films are \"Twilight\" (2008) and \"Red Riding Hood\" (2011).\n\nNancy Meyers has enjoyed success with her five features: \"The Parent Trap\" (1998), \"What Women Want\" (2000), \"Something's Gotta Give\" (2003), \"The Holiday\" (2006) and \"It's Complicated\" (2009) which have amassed $1,157.2 million worldwide. Before she started her directorial career she wrote some other successful films like \"Private Benjamin\" (1980) for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, \"Baby Boom\" (1987) or \"Father of the Bride\" (1991).\n\nSofia Coppola is a critically acclaimed director who has also had financial success. Her award-winning film \"Lost in Translation\" (2003) grossed over $119 million. \"The Virgin Suicides\" (1999), \"Marie Antoinette\" (2006) and \"The Bling Ring\" (2013) were also successful. Her father is Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nAva DuVernay is the director of the critically acclaimed \"Selma\" (2014) as well as the first African American woman to direct a triple-digit-budgeted film, \"A Wrinkle in Time\" (2018).\n\nA study done by USC Annenberg researched what it meant to be a female in the film industry, no matter if they were working behind the scenes or were fictional characters. USC Annenberg looked at two test groups for films, the top 100 films every year from 2007 to 2015 and the top 100 films in 2015.\n\nFor the top 100 films in 2015, women were leads and co-leads in 32 of them, while of the 32 films, only 3 of them included a race other than Caucasian. Out of the thousands of speaking roles, only 32 characters were LGBT and of those characters, 40% of them were racially diverse. Female characters were also three times more likely to be seen in a sexual context.\n\nBehind the scenes had similar statistics to the female fictional characters. Female directors, writers, and producers made up 19% of the 1,365 people that it took to create the top 100 films in 2015. The percentage of female writers (11.8%) and producers (22%) can be seen as high compared to female directors (7.5%). Of the 7.5% of female directors, three of them were African American and one was Asian.\n\nFor the top 100 films every year from 2007 until 2015, of the 800 films, 4.1% were directed by females.\n\nWhile there is still a gap between the percent of female and male filmmakers, women tend to be more involved in documentary films. There is a higher percentage of women directing documentaries than women directing narrative films.\n\nIn the history of the Academy Awards, there have been 11 female documentary directors that have won Oscars for Best Documentary Feature. Barbara Kopple received two of those awards with her films \"Harlan County, USA\" (1977) and \"American Dream\" (1991). Yvonne Smith's film \"Adam Clayton Powell\" (1990) was nominated as well, making her the first African American producer to be nominated for 'Best Documentary Feature'.\n\nThe Center of the Study of Women in Television and Film has dedicated 18 years to the study of women in the film industry. An annual report is created, discussing how women have contributed to as filmmakers. Most of the findings from the research shows that, statistically, it says the same from year to year. The highest earning movies of the past 20 years, with the exception of foreign films and reissues, have been monitored and studied by the Celluloid Ceiling to provide information on the contributions and employment of women on these films.According to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, as of 2017, “women comprised 18% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers working on the top 250 domestic grossing films.\"The same study concluded that in 2017, 10 or more women were given one of these positions in 1% of films, compared to 10 or more men being hired for these jobs in 70% of films.Information from the Celluloid Ceiling shows that more women tend to be employed on film projects directed by women.According to the Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy, \"in films with at least one female director, women comprised 53% of writers. Conversely, in films with male directors, women comprised just 10% of writers.\"Statistically, female directors generally create films about and for women, and hire women to assume the roles of main characters or protagonists.The Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy additionally found that \"in 2015, women comprised only 22% of protagonists and 18% of antagonists. Just 34% of major characters and 33% of all speaking characters in the top 100 domestic grossing films were women.”\n\nThe group also contributes their time to creating articles discussing how women are viewed in film, not only as filmmakers but as fictional characters as well.\n\nJulie Dash's \"Daughters of the Dust\" (1991) was the first full-length film with general theatrical release written and directed by an African American woman. Since then there have been several African or African-American women who have written, produced or directed films with national release. Neema Barnette (\"Civil Brand\"), Maya Angelou (\"Down in the Delta\"), Kasi Lemmons (\"Eve's Bayou\"), Cheryl Dunye (\"My Baby's Daddy\"), Stephanie Allain (\"Biker Boyz\"), Tracey Edmonds (\"Soul Food\"), Frances-Anne Solomon (\"A Winter Tale\") and Dianne Houston (\"City of Angels\"), Leslie Harris (Just Another Girl on the IRT) are among these filmmakers. In 1994 Darnell Martin became the first African American woman to write and direct a film produced by a major studio when Columbia Pictures backed \"I Like It Like That\".\n\nTo date, Nnegest Likké is the first African American woman to write, direct and act in a full-length movie released by a major studio, \"Phat Girlz\" (2006) starring Jimmy Jean-Louis and Mo'Nique.\n\nFor a much fuller accounting of the larger history of black women filmmakers, see Yvonne Welbon's 62-minute documentary \"Sisters in Cinema\" (2003).\n\nThe Cameroonian journalist Thérèse Sita-Bella directed a 1963 documentary, \"Tam-Tam à Paris\", and Sarah Maldoror, a French filmmaker of Guadeloupean descent, shot the feature-film \"Sambizanga\" in Angola in 1972. But the first African woman film director to gain international recognition was the Senegalese ethnologist Safi Faye with a film about the village in which she was born (\"Letter from the Village\", 1975). The 1989 Créteil International Women's Film Festival included short films by Leonie Yangba Zowe of the Central African Republic (\"Yangba-Bola\" and \"Lengue\", 1985) and Flora M'mbugu-Schelling of Tanzania. Other African women filmmakers include Anne Mungai, Fanta Régina Nacro (\"The Night of Truth\", 2004), Tsitsi Dangarembga (\"Mother's Day\", 2004) and Marguerite Abouet, an Ivorian graphic novel writer who co-directed an animated film based on her graphic novel: Aya de Yopougon (2012). The most successful film in the history of Nollywood, \"The Wedding Party\", was directed by Kemi Adetiba in 2016.\n\nA number of well-known Indian female filmmakers have achieved astounding commercial success from their films, including Mira Nair, Aparna Sen, Deepa Mehta, Gurinder Chadha, and Manju Borah. However, there are a number of other Indian women filmmakers who have made some remarkable films that go beyond just entertainment; they take advantage of their platform to address a range of social and political issues. Other noteworthy Indian women filmmakers include Nisha Ganatra, Sonali Gulati, Indu Krishnan, Eisha Marjara, Pratibha PJaaparmar, Nandini Sikand, Ish Amitoj Kaur, Harpreet Kaur, Leena Manimekalai and Shashwati Talukdar, Rima Das.\n\nDeepa Mehta is known as a transnational filmmaker whose work in film is recognized internationally at the highest levels. Her emotionally moving, award winning films have been played at almost every major film festival across the globe, and rank as favorites amongst many. She produced the film \"Heaven on Earth\", in 2008, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. Since its release, the film has turned into a useful tool for professionals who specialize in assisting abused women, specifically looking at the circumstances of immigrant women in abusive environments, as it has been screened at conferences of crown attorneys, judges and healthcare workers in order to help them better understand these women’s situations. Some of her other well-known works include her elemental trilogy: \"Earth\" (1996), \"Fire\" (1998), \"Water\" (2005), where dominant masculine values and practices of oppression and exploitation of women are challenged in this compelling three part series. Feminist social issues are highlighted, such as the mistreatment of widows, religious misogyny, and child brides in rural parts of India. She received an Oscar Nomination for \"Water\" in 2007. Other notable films of hers are \"Bollywood/Hollywood\" (2002), and the adaptation of \"Midnight’s Children\" (2012). \n\nMira Nair, a talented and accomplished Indian filmmaker, has written, produced and directed a plethora of award-winning documentaries. Her unique ability to provoke both western and non-western viewers in a variety of ways has led her to be seen as a non-traditional filmmaker who is not afraid of creating controversy through her work. \"So Far From India\" (1983) depicted the story of a young, working Indian immigrant in New York City and his harrowing experience of acculturation. While dealing with his own new struggles in America, he also has to worry about his pregnant wife back home. \"India Cabaret\" (1986), is a documentary-style film that lended a voice to strippers or cabaret dancers in Mumbai. Beyond these impressive works, she also has a list of feature films under her belt; her debut feature film, \"Salaam Bombay!\" (1988), which detailed the urban devastation created by prostitution and poverty, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1988, won the Prix du Publique for most popular entry at the Cannes Film Festival, the Camera D'Or for best first feature, as well as 25 other international awards.\n\nIn Japan for a long time Kinuyo Tanaka was the only woman to make feature films. She was able to do this against fierce resistance because she enjoyed a status as star actress. Using genre conventions, she showed women \"with a humorous affection rare in Japanese cinema of the period\" (Philip Kemp).\n\nCurrently, the best-known women filmmaker of Japan may be Naomi Kawase; 2007 she won the Grand Prix in Cannes, while Memoirs of a fig tree, the directorial debut of well-known actress Kaori Momoi, saw the light of the day in 2006. The sociocritical adventure film \"\" by Shimako Sato's was \"\"a breakthrough into a bigger budget; it starred Takeshi Kaneshiro and was released all over the world.\n\nSimilarly in South Korea, Yim Soon-rye landed a box-office-hit with \"Forever the Moment\", while So Yong Kim got some attention for her film \"In Between Days\" and Lee Suk-Gyung made the women-themed and subtly feminist \"The Day After\".\n\nOne of the important fifth-generation filmmakers of China is Ning Ying, who won several prizes for her films; in contrast to the controversy over some of her sixth-generation colleagues such as Zhang Yimou, who got accused of having sold out their ideals, Ning Ying has gone on to realize small independent films with themes strongly linked to Chinese daily life, therefore also being a link between the 5th and 6th generation. The Sixth Generation has seen a growing number of women filmmakers such as Liu Jiayin, best known for her film \"Oxhide\", and Xiaolu Guo; in 2001 Li Yu caused quite a stir with her lesbian love story \"Fish and Elephant\".\n\nThe most famous women filmmaker from Hong Kong is undoubtedly Ann Hui, who has made a wide array of films ranging from the wuxia genre to drama; Ivy Ho and Taiwanese Sylvia Chang also are known names in the Hong Kong industry, while in Taiwan queer filmmaker Zero Chou has gotten acclaim on festivals around the world.\n\nLindan Hu has documented the post-Mao re-emergence of female desire in women's cinema of the 1980s in mainland China. The films Hu considers are \"Army Nurse\" directed by Hu Mei and \"Women on the Long March\" directed by Liu Miaomiao.\n\nYasmin Ahmad (1958–2009) is considered one of the most important directors of Malaysia; originally a commercial director, she switched to feature films relatively late and gained international acclaim while also stirring controversy among conservatives in her home country.\n\nIn Pakistan, where the film industry is not very big, some prominent and brilliant directors are working. Conventional film industry has directors like Sangeeta and Shamim Ara who are making films with feminist themes. Especially to Sangeeta's credit there are some issue-based films. Now some new directors from television industry are also coming towards the medium of films. Sabiha Sumar and Mehreen Jabbar are two new names for films in Pakistan and are making brilliant films. Both of these directors has made films which are not only issue based addressing national issues but also these films have won international awards at different film festivals.\n\nRakhshan Bani-Etemad, a writer and a director, is probably Iran's best known and certainly most prolific female filmmaker. She has established herself as the elder stateswoman of Iranian cinema with documentaries and films dealing with social pathology. Contemporary Iranian poet Forugh Farrokhzad (1935—1967) was also a filmmaker. Her best-known film is \"The House is Black\" (Khane siah ast, 1962), a documentary of a leper colony in the north of Iran. Samira Makhmalbaf directed her first film \"The Apple\" when she was only 17 years old and won Cannes Jury Prize in 2000 for her following film \"The Blackboard\". Her step-mother Marzieh Meshkini made \"The Day I Became a Woman\" and Samira's sister Hana Makhmalbaf started her career with \"The Joy of Madness\", a behind-the-scenes documentary about Samira's film \"At Five in the Afternoon\", and has subsequently made two features, Buddha Collapsed out of Shame and \"Green Days\", a film about the Green Revolution that was banned in Iran.\n\nSumitra Peries is a veteran film director in Sri Lankan cinema and she is the wife of great Lester James Peries. She also held the post of Sri Lanka's ambassador to France, Spain and the United Nations in the late 1990s.\n\nInoka Sathyangani is an internationally acclaimed Sri Lankan film director and producer. In the year 2002, she received many number awards for her maiden effort Sulang Kirilli, which deals with the theme of abortion. The film secured the highest number of awards won by a single film in the history of Sri Lanka's film industry.\n\nMarta Rodriguez is a Colombian documentary film maker.\n\nThough women played a \"minimal\" role in the development of cinema in Argentina, two pioneering women were the director María Luisa Bemberg and the producer Lita Stantic. Lucrecia Martel is a major figure of the Argentinean \"buena onda\", the post-economic crash new cinema. Lucia Puenzo is the other prominent contemporary Argentinean director. Each of them has made three features to date (2014). In addition, María Victoria Menis has written and directed several critically acclaimed films, including La cámara oscura (2008) and María y el araña (2013).\n\nBrazilian Cinema has a number of women directors whose works date from the 1930s. Brazilian women directors' most prolific era unfolds from the 1970s. Some contemporary names include: Ana Carolina, Betse De Paula, Carla Camurati, Eliane Caffé, Helena Solberg, Lúcia Murat, Sandra Kogut, Suzana Amaral, and Tata Amaral.\n\nMatilde Landeta was the first woman to become a filmmaker during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema.

The concept is related to but differs from the concepts of heaven, the afterlife, and the Kingdom of God in that heaven is another place or state generally seen as above the world, the afterlife is generally an individual's life after death, and the Kingdom of God could be in the present (such as Realized eschatology) or the future.\n\nIn Hindu eschatology the current age is the Kali Yuga, a period of decline. Kalki ('Destroyer of Filth') will appear to purge all evil, beginning a golden age of Satya Yuga.\n\nThere have been a range of dates predicted, purportedly from different methods of calculation. Sri Potuluri Virabrahmendra Swami, for example, wrote 400 years ago in his \"Divya Maha Kala Gnana,\" or 'Divine Knowledge of the Time,' that Kalki would arrive when the moon, sun, Venus and Jupiter entered the same sign. This is not a rare occurrence and last happened in early 2012, passing without event. The time of arrival of Kalki has not been consistently asserted by astrologers.\n\n\"HaOlam HaBa\", or \"the world to come\", is an important part of Jewish eschatology, although Judaism concentrates on the importance of \"HaOlam HaZeh\" (\"this world\"). The afterlife is known as \"Olam haBa\", \"Gan Eden\" (the Heavenly Garden of Eden) and \"Gehinom\". According to the Talmud, any non-Jew who lives according to the Seven Laws of Noah is regarded as a \"Ger toshav\" (righteous gentile), and is assured of a place in the world to come, the final reward of the righteous.\n\nUnder Christian eschatology, the phrase is found in the Nicene Creed (current Ecumenical version): \"We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.\" It is also found in the King James Version of the New Testament at , , , , . Other related expressions are \"age to come\" which is typically found in more recent translations, Kingdom of God, Messianic Age, Millennial Age, The New Earth and New Jerusalem, and dispensation of the fulness of times and possibly also eternal life.\n\nIn Zoroastrian eschatology, the world to come is the \"frashokereti\", where the \"saoshyant\" will bring about a resurrection of the dead in the bodies they had before they died. This is followed by a last judgment. The \"yazatas\" Airyaman and Atar will melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and the molten metal will then flow across the earth like a river. All humankind—both the living and the resurrected dead—will be required to wade through that river, but for the righteous (\"ashavan\") it will seem to be a river of warm milk, while the wicked will be burned. The river will then flow down to hell, where it will annihilate Angra Mainyu and the last vestiges of wickedness in the universe.\n\n"}
