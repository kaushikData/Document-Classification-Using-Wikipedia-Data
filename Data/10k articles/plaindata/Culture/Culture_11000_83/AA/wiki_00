{"id": "1686342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1686342", "title": "Adaptive behavior", "text": "Adaptive behavior\n\nAdaptive behavior refers to behavior that enables a person (usually used in the context of children) to get along in his or her environment with greatest success and least conflict with others. This is a term used in the areas of psychology and special education. Adaptive behavior relates to every day skills or tasks that the average person is able to complete, similar to the term life skills.\n\nNonconstructive or disruptive social or personal behaviors can sometimes be used to achieve a constructive outcome. For example, a constant repetitive action could be re-focused on something that creates or builds something. In other words, the behavior can be adapted to something else.\n\nIn contrast, maladaptive behavior is a type of behavior that is often used to reduce one's anxiety, but the result is dysfunctional and non-productive. For example, avoiding situations because you have unrealistic fears may initially reduce your anxiety, but it is non-productive in alleviating the actual problem in the long term. Maladaptive behavior is frequently used as an indicator of abnormality or mental dysfunction, since its assessment is relatively free from subjectivity. However, many behaviors considered moral can be maladaptive, such as dissent or abstinence.\n\nAdaptive behavior reflects an individual’s social and practical competence to meet the demands of everyday living. Behavior patterns change throughout a person's development, across life settings and social constructs, changes in personal values, and the expectations of others. It is important to assess adaptive behavior in order to determine how well an individual functions in daily life: vocationally, socially and educationally.\n\n\nLimitations in self-care skills and social relationships, as well as behavioral excesses are common characteristics of individuals with mental disabilities. Individuals with mental disabilities who require extensive supports are often taught basic self care skills such as dressing, eating, and hygiene. Direct instruction and environmental supports, such as added prompts and simplified routines are necessary to ensure that deficits in these adaptive areas do not come to seriously limit one's quality of life.\n\nMost children with milder forms of mental disabilities learn how to take care of their basic needs, but they often require training in self-management skills to achieve the levels of performance necessary for eventual independent living. Making and sustaining friendships and personal relationships present significant challenges for many persons with mental disabilities. Limited cognitive processing skills, poor language development, and unusual or inappropriate behaviors can seriously impede interacting with others. Teaching students with mental disabilities appropriate social and interpersonal skills is one of the most important functions of special education. Students with mental disabilities more often exhibit behavior problems than children without disabilities. Some of the behaviors observed by students with mental disabilities are difficulties accepting criticism, limited self-control, and inappropriate behaviors. The greater the severity of the mental disabilities, generally the higher the incidence of behavioral problems.\n\nIn education, adaptive behavior is defined as that which (1) meets the needs of the community of stakeholders (parents, teachers, peers, and later employers) and (2) meets the needs of the learner, \"now\" and \"in the future\". Specifically, these behaviors include such things as effective speech, self-help, using money, cooking, and reading, for example.\n\nTraining in adaptive behavior is a key component of any educational program, but is critically important for children with special needs. The US Department of Education has allocated billions of dollars ($12.3 billion in 2008) for Special Education programs aimed at improving educational and early intervention outcomes for children with disabilities. \nIn 2001, the United States National Research Council published a comprehensive review of interventions for children and adults diagnosed with autism. The review indicates that interventions based on applied behavior analysis have been effective with these groups.\n\nAdaptive behavior includes socially responsible and independent performance of daily activities. However, the specific activities and skills needed may differ from setting to setting. When a student is going to school, school and academic skills are adaptive. However, some of those same skills might be useless or maladaptive in a job settings, so the transition between school and job needs careful attention.\n\nAdaptive behavior includes the age-appropriate behaviors necessary for people to live independently and to function safely and appropriately in daily life. Adaptive behaviors include life skills such as grooming, dressing, safety, food handling, working, money management, cleaning, making friends, social skills, and the personal responsibility expected of their age and social group. Specific skills include:\n\n\nAdaptive behaviors are considered to change due to the persons culture and surroundings. Professors have to delve into the students technical and comprehension skills to measure how adaptive their behavior is. \n\n\nEvery human being must learn a set of skills that is beneficial for the environments and communities they live in. Adaptive skills are stepping stones toward accessing and benefiting from local or remote communities. This means that, in urban environments, to go to the movies, a child will have to learn to navigate through the town or take the bus, read the movie schedule, and pay for the movie. Adaptive skills allow for safer exploration because they provide the learner with an increased awareness of his/her surroundings and of changes in context, that require new adaptive responses to meet the demands and dangers of that new context. Adaptive skills may generate more opportunities to engage in meaningful social interactions and acceptance. Adaptive skills are socially acceptable and desirable at any age and regardless of gender (with the exception of gender specific biological differences such as menstrual care skills, etc.)\n\nAdaptive skills encompass a range of daily situations and they usually start with a task analysis. The task analysis will reveal all the steps necessary to perform the task in the natural environment. The use of behavior analytic procedures has been documented, with children, adolescents and adults, under the guidance of behavior analysts and supervised behavioral technicians. The list of applications has a broad scope and it is in continuous expansion as more research is carried out in applied behavior analysis (see \"Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis\", \"The Analysis of Verbal Behavior\").\n\nAccording to practopoietic theory, creation of adaptive behavior involves special, \"poietic\" interactions among different levels of system organization. These interactions are described on the basis of cybernetic theory in particular, good regulator theorem. In practopoietic systems, lower levels of organization determine the properties of higher levels of organization, but not the other way around. This ensures that lower levels of organization (e.g., genes) always possess cybernetically more general knowledge than the higher levels of organization—knowledge at a higher level being a special case of the knowledge at the lower level. At the highest level of organization lies the overt behavior. Cognitive operations lay in the middle parts of that hierarchy, above genes and below behavior. For behavior to be adaptive, at least three adaptive traverses are needed.\n\n\n"}

It is now housed in the Gemäldegalerie of Berlin.\n\nAn inscription mentioned by Filippo Baldinucci, dated 20 November 1449, reported that the altarpiece was commissioned by Leonardo di Francesco di Nardo Falladanzi, the rector of San Miniato tra le Torri, a church in Florence. Falladanzi kept a notebook in which he noted that he paid \"maestro Andrea, pintore\" 104 lire for an altarpiece for the main altar of the church.\n\nThe church was demolished around 1888 (it was located where the main post office is today), and its heritage was dispersed, after which Andrea del Castagno's \"Assumption\" was acquired by Berlin's Gemäldegalerie.\n\nThe painting portrays Mary in a wide blue cloak, while she is lifted up from a sepulchre depicted in perspective. The cloak, as typical in Andrea del Castagno, is painted with a heavy use of chiaroscuro. The sepulchre contains roses, a flower usually associated with the Virgin. She is carried within a brilliant mandorla by three angels.\n\nAt Mary's sides, both with a red aureola, are St. Julian (left, with a sword) and St. Minias of Florence (right, with a stick and a crown). While the Virgin is portrayed in a realistic posture, the two saints have a more mystic and static appearance. Both men are elegantly dressed in the most expensive of contemporary costumes. Not only the damask fabrics, but also the saturated red color indicate the costliness of their garments.\n\nThe background was painted in gold, with a blending effect in correspondence of the saints' aureolas.\n"}
{"id": "4273140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4273140", "title": "Avatar (2009 film)", "text": "Avatar (2009 film)\n\nAvatar, marketed as James Cameron's Avatar, is a 2009 American epic science fiction film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron, and stars Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver. The film is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi – a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.\n\nDevelopment of \"Avatar\" began in 1994, when Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film. Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 film \"Titanic\", for a planned release in 1999, but, according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film. Work on the language of the film's extraterrestrial beings began in 2005, and Cameron began developing the screenplay and fictional universe in early 2006. \"Avatar\" was officially budgeted at $237 million. Other estimates put the cost between $280 million and $310 million for production and at $150 million for promotion. The film made extensive use of new motion capture filming techniques, and was released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats), and for \"4D\" experiences in select South Korean theaters. The stereoscopic filmmaking was touted as a breakthrough in cinematic technology.\n\n\"Avatar\" premiered in London on , 2009, and was internationally released on and in the United States and Canada on , to positive critical reviews, with critics highly praising its groundbreaking visual effects. During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office records and became the highest-grossing film of all time, as well as in the United States and Canada, surpassing Cameron's \"Titanic\", which had held those records for twelve years. It also became the first film to gross more than and the best-selling film of 2010 in the United States. \"Avatar\" was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three, for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects.\n\nFollowing the film's success, Cameron signed with 20th Century Fox to produce four sequels: \"Avatar 2\" and \"Avatar 3\" are currently filming, and will be released on December 18, 2020, and December 17, 2021 respectively; subsequent sequels will start shooting as soon as they wrap filming, and will be released in 2024 and 2025. Several cast members are expected to return, including Worthington, Saldana, Lang, and Weaver.\n\nIn 2154, humans have depleted Earth's natural resources, leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA for short) mines for a valuable mineral — unobtanium — on Pandora, a densely forested habitable moon orbiting the gas giant Polyphemus in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi, a species of , blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature and worship a mother goddess named Eywa.\n\nTo explore Pandora's biosphere, scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called \"avatars\", operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former Marine, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jake's avatar is attacked by a thanator and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.\n\nColonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's private security force, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree, which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Over the following three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge, and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.\n\nDespite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the biological neural network native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake and Grace and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.\n\nTo regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred Tree of Souls and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a pre-emptive strike against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi.\n\nDuring the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an AMP suit, escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.\n\nWith the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth, after which Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.\n\n\n\nIn 1994, director James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for \"Avatar\", drawing inspiration from \"every single science fiction book\" he had read in his childhood as well as from adventure novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard. In , Cameron announced that after completing \"Titanic\", he would film \"Avatar\", which would make use of synthetic, or computer-generated, actors. The project would cost $100 million and involve at least six actors in leading roles \"who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world\". Visual effects house Digital Domain, with whom Cameron has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release. However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he intended to tell. He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years. It was revealed in a \"Bloomberg BusinessWeek\" cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10 million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for \"Avatar\", which he showed to Fox executives in .\n\nIn February 2006, Cameron revealed that his film \"Project 880\" was \"a retooled version of \"Avatar\"\", a film that he had tried to make years earlier, citing the technological advances in the creation of the computer-generated characters Gollum, King Kong, and Davy Jones. Cameron had chosen \"Avatar\" over his project \"\" after completing a five-day camera test in the previous year.\n\nFrom January to April 2006, Cameron worked on the script and developed a culture for the film's aliens, the Na'vi. Their language was created by Dr. Paul Frommer, a linguist at USC. The Na'vi language has a lexicon of about 1000 words, with some 30 added by Cameron. The tongue's phonemes include ejective consonants (such as the \"kx\" in \"skxawng\") that are found in the Amharic language of Ethiopia, and the initial \"ng\" that Cameron may have taken from New Zealand Māori. Actress Sigourney Weaver and the film's set designers met with Jodie S. Holt, professor of plant physiology at University of California, Riverside, to learn about the methods used by botanists to study and sample plants, and to discuss ways to explain the communication between Pandora's organisms depicted in the film.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Cameron worked with a handful of designers, including famed fantasy illustrator Wayne Barlowe and renowned concept artist Jordu Schell, to shape the design of the Na'vi with paintings and physical sculptures when Cameron felt that 3-D brush renderings were not capturing his vision, often working together in the kitchen of Cameron's Malibu home. In , Cameron announced that he would film \"Avatar\" for a mid-2008 release and planned to begin principal photography with an established cast by . The following August, the visual effects studio Weta Digital signed on to help Cameron produce \"Avatar\". Stan Winston, who had collaborated with Cameron in the past, joined \"Avatar\" to help with the film's designs. Production design for the film took several years. The film had two different production designers, and two separate art departments, one of which focused on the flora and fauna of Pandora, and another that created human machines and human factors. In , Cameron was announced to be using his own Reality Camera System to film in 3-D. The system would use two high-definition cameras in a single camera body to create depth perception.\n\nWhile these preparations were underway, Fox kept wavering in its commitment to \"Avatar\" because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, \"Titanic\", even though Cameron rewrote the script to combine several characters together and offered to cut his fee in case the film flopped. Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future. In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron \"in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film,\" so he began shopping it around to other studios, and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof-of-concept to then-chairman Dick Cook. However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal. In , Fox finally agreed to commit to making \"Avatar\" after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to less than half of the film's official $237 million budget. After Fox accepted \"Avatar\", one skeptical Fox executive shook his head and told Cameron and Landau, \"I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for thinking you \"can\" do this ...\"\nIn December 2006, Cameron described \"Avatar\" as \"a futuristic tale set on a planet 200 years hence ... an old-fashioned jungle adventure with an environmental conscience [that] aspires to a mythic level of storytelling\". The press release described the film as \"an emotional journey of redemption and revolution\" and said the story is of \"a wounded former Marine, thrust unwillingly into an effort to settle and exploit an exotic planet rich in biodiversity, who eventually crosses over to lead the indigenous race in a battle for survival\". The story would be of an entire world complete with an ecosystem of phantasmagorical plants and creatures, and native people with a rich culture and language.\n\nEstimates put the cost of the film at about $280–310 million to produce and an estimated $150 million for marketing, noting that about $30 million in tax credits will lessen the financial impact on the studio and its financiers. A studio spokesperson said that the budget was \"$237 million, with $150 million for promotion, end of story.\"\n\n\"Avatar\" is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism and deep ecology.\nCameron said his inspiration was \"every single science fiction book I read as a kid\", and that he was particularly striving to update the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs's \"John Carter\" series and the deep jungles of Pandora were visualized from Disney's 37th animated film, \"Tarzan\". He acknowledged that \"Avatar\" shares themes with the films \"At Play in the Fields of the Lord\", \"The Emerald Forest\", and \"Princess Mononoke\", which feature clashes between cultures and civilizations, and with \"Dances with Wolves,\" where a battered soldier finds himself drawn to the culture he was initially fighting against.\n\nIn a 2007 interview with \"Time\" magazine, Cameron was asked about the meaning of the term \"Avatar\", to which he replied, \"It's an incarnation of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human's intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body.\"\nThe look of the Na'vi – the humanoids indigenous to Pandora – was inspired by a dream that Cameron's mother had, long before he started work on \"Avatar\". In her dream, she saw a blue-skinned woman 12 feet () tall, which he thought was \"kind of a cool image\". Also he said, \"I just like blue. It's a good color ... plus, there's a connection to the Hindu deities, which I like conceptually.\" He included similar creatures in his first screenplay (written in 1976 or 1977), which featured a planet with a native population of \"gorgeous\" tall blue aliens. The Na'vi were based on them.\n\nFor the love story between characters Jake and Neytiri, Cameron applied a star-crossed love theme, and acknowledged its similarity to the pairing of Jack and Rose from his film \"Titanic.\" An interviewer stated, \"Both couples come from radically different cultures that are contemptuous of their relationship and are forced to choose sides between the competing communities.\" Cameron felt that whether or not the Jake and Neytiri love story would be perceived as believable partially hinged on the physical attractiveness of Neytiri's alien appearance, which was developed by considering her appeal to the all-male crew of artists. Although Cameron felt Jake and Neytiri do not fall in love right away, their portrayers (Worthington and Saldana) felt the characters do. Cameron said the two actors \"had a great chemistry\" during filming.\n\nFor the film's floating \"Hallelujah Mountains\", the designers drew inspiration from \"many different types of mountains, but mainly the karst limestone formations in China.\" According to production designer Dylan Cole, the fictional floating rocks were inspired by Mount Huang (also known as Huangshan), Guilin, Zhangjiajie, among others around the world. Cameron had noted the influence of the Chinese peaks on the design of the floating mountains.\n\nTo create the interiors of the human mining colony on Pandora, production designers visited the \"Noble Clyde Boudreaux\" oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico during . They photographed, measured and filmed every aspect of the platform, which was later replicated on-screen with photorealistic CGI during post-production.\n\nCameron said that he wanted to make \"something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the adventure and all that\" but also have a conscience \"that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think a little bit about the way you interact with nature and your fellow man\". He added that \"the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are\" and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans \"represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future\".\n\nCameron acknowledges that \"Avatar\" implicitly criticizes the United States' role in the Iraq War and the impersonal nature of mechanized warfare in general. In reference to the use of the term \"shock and awe\" in the film, Cameron said, \"We know what it feels like to launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America.\" He said in later interviews, \"... I think it's very patriotic to question a system that needs to be corralled ...\" and, \"The film is definitely not anti-American.\"\nA scene in the film portrays the violent destruction of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers. Asked about the scene's resemblance to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, Cameron said he had been \"surprised at how much it did look like \".\n\nPrincipal photography for \"Avatar\" began in in Los Angeles and Wellington, New Zealand. Cameron described the film as a hybrid with a full live-action shoot in combination with computer-generated characters and live environments. \"Ideally at the end of the day the audience has no idea which they're looking at,\" Cameron said. The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film. The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3-D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace. In , Fox had announced that 3-D filming for \"Avatar\" would be done at 24 frames per second despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3-D film requires higher frame rate to make strobing less noticeable. According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional miniatures.\n\nMotion-capture photography lasted 31 days at the Hughes Aircraft stage in Playa Vista in Los Angeles. Live action photography began in at Stone Street Studios in Wellington, New Zealand, and was scheduled to last 31 days. More than a thousand people worked on the production. In preparation of the filming sequences, all of the actors underwent professional training specific to their characters such as archery, horseback riding, firearm use, and hand-to-hand combat. They received language and dialect training in the Na'vi language created for the film. Before shooting the film, Cameron also sent the cast to the Hawaiian tropical rainforests to get a feel for a rainforest setting before shooting on the soundstage.\n\nDuring filming, Cameron made use of his virtual camera system, a new way of directing motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, \"It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale.\" Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because there is no need for repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly. Cameron described the system as a \"form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements\".\n\nCameron gave fellow directors Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson a chance to test the new technology. Spielberg said, \"I like to think of it as digital makeup, not augmented animation ... Motion capture brings the director back to a kind of intimacy that actors and directors only know when they're working in live theater.\" Spielberg and George Lucas were also able to visit the set to watch Cameron direct with the equipment.\n\nTo film the shots where CGI interacts with live action, a unique camera referred to as a \"simulcam\" was used, a merger of the 3-D fusion camera and the virtual camera systems. While filming live action in real time with the simulcam, the CGI images captured with the virtual camera or designed from scratch, are superimposed over the live action images as in augmented reality and shown on a small monitor, making it possible for the director to instruct the actors how to relate to the virtual material in the scene.\n\nDue to Cameron's personal convictions about climate change, he allowed only plant-based (vegan) food to be served on set.\n\nA number of innovative visual effects techniques were used during production. According to Cameron, work on the film had been delayed since the 1990s to allow the techniques to reach the necessary degree of advancement to adequately portray his vision of the film. The director planned to make use of photorealistic computer-generated characters, created using new motion capture animation technologies he had been developing in the 14 months leading up to .\n\nInnovations include a new system for lighting massive areas like Pandora's jungle, a motion-capture stage or \"volume\" six times larger than any previously used, and an improved method of capturing facial expressions, enabling full performance capture. To achieve the face capturing, actors wore individually made skull caps fitted with a tiny camera positioned in front of the actors' faces; the information collected about their facial expressions and eyes is then transmitted to computers. According to Cameron, the method allows the filmmakers to transfer 100% of the actors' physical performances to their digital counterparts.\nBesides the performance capture data which were transferred directly to the computers, numerous reference cameras gave the digital artists multiple angles of each performance. A technically challenging scene was near the end of the film when the computer-generated Neytiri held the live action Jake in human form, and attention was given to the details of the shadows and reflected light between them.\n\nThe lead visual effects company was Weta Digital in Wellington, New Zealand, at one point employing 900 people to work on the film. Because of the huge amount of data which needed to be stored, cataloged and available for everybody involved, even on the other side of the world, a new cloud computing and Digital Asset Management (DAM) system named Gaia was created by Microsoft especially for \"Avatar\", which allowed the crews to keep track of and coordinate all stages in the digital processing. To render \"Avatar\", Weta used a server farm making use of 4,000 Hewlett-Packard servers with 35,000 processor cores with 104 terabytes of RAM and three petabytes of network area storage running Ubuntu Linux, Grid Engine cluster manager, and 2 of the animation software and managers, Pixar's RenderMan and Pixar's Alfred queue management system. The render farm occupies the 193rd to 197th spots in the TOP500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers. A new texturing and paint software system, called Mari, was developed by The Foundry in cooperation with Weta. Creating the Na'vi characters and the virtual world of Pandora required over a petabyte of digital storage, and each minute of the final footage for \"Avatar\" occupies 17.28 gigabytes of storage. It would often take the computer several hours to render a single frame of the film. To help finish preparing the special effects sequences on time, a number of other companies were brought on board, including Industrial Light & Magic, which worked alongside Weta Digital to create the battle sequences. ILM was responsible for the visual effects for many of the film's specialized vehicles and devised a new way to make CGI explosions. Joe Letteri was the film's visual effects general supervisor.\n\nComposer James Horner scored the film, his third collaboration with Cameron after \"Aliens\" and \"Titanic\". Horner recorded parts of the score with a small chorus singing in the alien language Na'vi in .\nHe also worked with Wanda Bryant, an ethnomusicologist, to create a music culture for the alien race.\nThe first scoring sessions were planned to take place in early 2009. During production, Horner promised Cameron that he would not work on any other project except for \"Avatar\" and reportedly worked on the score from four in the morning until ten at night throughout the process. He stated in an interview, \"\"Avatar\" has been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken.\" Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one. He first created a score that reflected the Na'vi way of sound and then combined it with a separate \"traditional\" score to drive the film.\nBritish singer Leona Lewis was chosen to sing the theme song for the film, called \"I See You\". An accompanying music video, directed by Jake Nava, premiered , 2009, on MySpace.\n\nThe first photo of the film was released on , 2009, and \"Empire\" released exclusive images from the film in its October issue. Cameron, producer Jon Landau, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, and Sigourney Weaver appeared at a panel, moderated by Tom Rothman, at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con on . Twenty-five minutes of footage was screened in Dolby 3D.\nWeaver and Cameron appeared at additional panels to promote the film, speaking on the 23rd and 24th respectively. James Cameron announced at the Comic-Con Avatar Panel that will be 'Avatar Day'. On this day, the trailer was released in all theatrical formats. The official game trailer and toy line of the film were also unveiled on this day.\n\nThe 129-second trailer was released online on , 2009.\nThe new 210-second trailer was premiered in theatres on , 2009, then soon after premiered online on Yahoo! on , 2009, to positive reviews.\nAn extended version in IMAX 3D received overwhelmingly positive reviews. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said that audience expectations were coloured by \"the [same] establishment skepticism that preceded \"Titanic\"\" and suggested the showing reflected the desire for original storytelling. The teaser has been among the most viewed trailers in the history of film marketing, reaching the first place of all trailers viewed on Apple.com with 4 million views.\nOn October 30, to celebrate the opening of the first 3-D cinema in Vietnam, Fox allowed Megastar Cinema to screen exclusive 16 minutes of Avatar to a number of press. The three-and-a-half-minute trailer of the film premiered live on , 2009, during a Dallas Cowboys football game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on the Diamond Vision screen, one of the world's largest video displays, and to TV audiences viewing the game on Fox. It is said to be the largest live motion picture trailer viewing in history.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company collaborated with Fox to launch a worldwide marketing campaign to promote the film. The highlight of the campaign was the website AVTR.com. Specially marked bottles and cans of Coca-Cola Zero, when held in front of a webcam, enabled users to interact with the website's 3-D features using augmented reality (AR) technology. The film was heavily promoted in an episode of the Fox Network series \"Bones\" in the episode \"The Gamer In The Grease\" (Season 5, Episode 9). \"Avatar\" star Joel David Moore has a recurring role on the program, and is seen in the episode anxiously awaiting the release of the film. A week prior to the American release, Zoe Saldana promoted the film on Adult Swim when she was interviewed by an animated Space Ghost. McDonald's had a promotion mentioned in television commercials in Europe called \"Avatarize yourself\", which encouraged people to go to the website set up by Oddcast, and use a photograph of themselves to change into a Na'vi.\n\n\"Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora\", a 224-page book in the form of a field guide to the film's fictional setting of the planet of Pandora, was released by Harper Entertainment on , 2009.\nIt is presented as a compilation of data collected by the humans about Pandora and the life on it, written by Maria Wilhelm and Dirk Mathison. HarperFestival also released Wilhelm's 48-page \"James Cameron's Avatar: The Reusable Scrapbook\" for children. \"The Art of Avatar\" was released on , 2009, by Abrams Books. The book features detailed production artwork from the film, including production sketches, illustrations by Lisa Fitzpatrick, and film stills. Producer Jon Landau wrote the foreword, Cameron wrote the epilogue, and director Peter Jackson wrote the preface. In , Abrams Books also released \"The Making of Avatar\", a 272-page book that detailed the film's production process and contains over 500 color photographs and illustrations.\n\nIn a 2009 interview, Cameron said that he planned to write a novel version of \"Avatar\" after the film was released. In , producer Jon Landau stated that Cameron plans a prequel novel for \"Avatar\" that will \"lead up to telling the story of the movie, but it would go into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with\", saying that \"Jim wants to write a novel that is a big, epic story that fills in a lot of things\". In August 2013 it was announced that Cameron hired Steven Gould to pen four standalone novels to expand the \"Avatar\" universe.\n\nCameron chose Ubisoft Montreal to create an \"Avatar\" game for the film in 2007. The filmmakers and game developers collaborated heavily, and Cameron decided to include some of Ubisoft's vehicle and creature designs in the film.\n\"James Cameron's Avatar: The Game\" was released on , 2009 for most home video game consoles (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo DS, iPhone) and Microsoft Windows, and for PlayStation Portable.\n\nMattel Toys announced in December 2009 that it would be introducing a line of \"Avatar\" action figures.\nEach action figure will be made with a 3-D web tag, called an i-TAG, that consumers can scan using a web cam, revealing unique on-screen content that is exclusive to each specific action figure. A series of toys representing six different characters from the film were also distributed globally in McDonald's Happy Meals.\n\nIn December 2009, France Post released a special limited edition stamp based on \"Avatar\", coinciding with the film's worldwide release.\n\n\"Avatar\" premiered in London on , 2009, and was released theatrically worldwide from to 18. The film was originally set for release on , 2009, during filming, but was pushed back to allow more post-production time (the last shots were delivered in November), and to give more time for theatres worldwide to install 3D projectors. Cameron stated that the film's aspect ratio would be 1.78:1 for 3D screenings and that a 2.39:1 image would be extracted for 2D screenings. However, a 3D 2.39:1 extract was approved for use with constant-image-height screens (i.e. screens which increase in width to display 2.39:1 films). During a 3D preview showing in Germany on , the movie's DRM 'protection' system failed, and some copies delivered could not be watched at all in the theaters. The problems were fixed in time for the public premiere. \"Avatar\" was released in a total of 3,457 theatres in the US, of which 2,032 theatres ran it in 3D. In total 90% of all advance ticket sales for \"Avatar\" were for 3D screenings.\n\nInternationally, \"Avatar\" opened on a total of 14,604 screens in 106 territories, of which 3,671 were showing the film in 3D (producing 56% of the first weekend gross). The film was simultaneously presented in IMAX 3D format, opening in 178 theaters in the United States on . The international IMAX release included 58 theaters beginning on , and 25 more theaters were to be added in the coming weeks. The IMAX release was the company's widest to date, a total of 261 theaters worldwide. The previous IMAX record opening was \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\", which opened in 161 IMAX theatres in the US, and about 70 international. 20th Century Fox Korea adapted and later released \"Avatar\" in 4D version, which included \"moving seats, smells of explosives, sprinkling water, laser lights and wind\".\n\n\"Avatar\" was released internationally on more than 14,000 screens. It earned $3,537,000 from midnight screenings domestically (United States and Canada), with the initial 3D release limited to 2,200 screens. The film earned $26,752,099 on its opening day, and $77,025,481 over its opening weekend, making it the second-largest December opening ever behind \"I Am Legend\", the largest domestic opening weekend for a film not based on a franchise (topping \"The Incredibles\"), the highest opening weekend for a film entirely in 3D (breaking \"Up\"s record), the highest opening weekend for an environmentalist film (breaking \"The Day After Tomorrow\"s record), and the 40th largest opening weekend in North America, despite a blizzard that blanketed the East Coast of the United States and reportedly hurt its opening weekend results. The film also set an IMAX opening weekend record, with 178 theaters generating approximately $9.5 million, 12% of the film's $77 million (at the time) North American gross on less than 3% of the screens.\n\nInternational markets generating opening weekend tallies of at least $10 million were for Russia ($19.7 million), France ($17.4 million), the UK ($13.8 million), Germany ($13.3 million), South Korea ($11.7 million), Australia ($11.5 million) and Spain ($11.0 million). \"Avatar\"s worldwide gross was US$241.6 million after five days, the ninth largest opening-weekend gross of all time, and the largest for a non-franchise, non-sequel and original film. 58 international IMAX screens generated an estimated $4.1 million during the opening weekend.\n\nRevenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 1.8% in domestic markets, marking a rare occurrence, earning $75,617,183, to remain in first place at the box office and recording what was then the biggest second weekend of all time. The film experienced another marginal decrease in revenue in its third weekend, dropping 9.4% to $68,490,688 domestically, remaining in first place at the box office, to set a third-weekend record.\n\n\"Avatar\" crossed the $1 billion mark on the 19th day of its international release, making it the first film to reach this mark in only 19 days. It became the fifth film grossing more than $1 billion worldwide, and the only film of 2009 to do so. In its fourth weekend, \"Avatar\" continued to lead the box office domestically, setting a new all-time fourth-weekend record of $50,306,217, and becoming the highest-grossing 2009 release in the United States. In the film's fifth weekend, it set the Martin Luther King Day weekend record, grossing $54,401,446, and set a fifth-weekend record with a take of $42,785,612. It held the top spot to set the sixth and seventh weekend records earning $34,944,081 and $31,280,029 respectively. It was the fastest film to gross $600 million domestically, on its 47th day in theatres.\n\nOn , it became the first film to earn over worldwide, and it became the first film to gross over in the U.S. and Canada, on , after 72 days of release. It remained at number one at the domestic box office for seven consecutive weeks – the most consecutive No. 1 weekends since \"Titanic\" spent 15 weekends at No.1 in 1997 and 1998 – and also spent 11 consecutive weekends at the top of the box office outside the United States and Canada, breaking the record of nine consecutive weekends set by \"\". By the end of its first theatrical release \"Avatar\" had grossed $749,766,139 in the U.S. and Canada, and $ in other territories, for a worldwide total of $.\n\nIncluding the revenue from a re-release of \"Avatar\" featuring extended footage, \"Avatar\" grossed $760,507,625 in the U.S. and Canada, and $2,027,457,462 in other countries for a worldwide total of $2,787,965,087 with 72.7% of its total worldwide gross in international markets. \"Avatar\" has set a number of box office records during its release: on , 2010, it surpassed \"Titanic\"s worldwide gross to become the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide 41 days after its international release, just two days after taking the foreign box office record. On , 47 days after its domestic release, \"Avatar\" surpassed \"Titanic\" to become the highest-grossing film of all time in Canada and the United States. It became the highest-grossing film of all time in at least 30 other countries and is the first film to earn over $2 billion in foreign box office receipts.\nIMAX ticket sales account for $243.3 million of its worldwide gross, more than double the previous record.\n\nBox Office Mojo estimates that after adjusting for the rise in average ticket prices, \"Avatar\" would be the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time in North America. Box Office Mojo also observes that the higher ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screenings have had a significant impact on \"Avatar\"s gross; it estimated, on , 2010, that \"Avatar\" had sold approximately tickets in North American theatres, more than any other film since 1999's \"\". On a worldwide basis, when \"Avatar\"s gross stood at $2 billion just 35 days into its run, \"The Daily Telegraph\" estimated its gross was surpassed by only \"Gone with the Wind\" ($3.0 billion), \"Titanic\" ($2.9 billion) and \"Star Wars\" ($2.2 billion) after adjusting for inflation to 2010 prices, with \"Avatar\" ultimately winding up with $2.8 billion by the end of its run in 2010. Reuters even placed it ahead of \"Titanic\" after adjusting the global total for inflation. The 2015 edition of Guinness World Records lists Avatar only behind Gone with the Wind in terms of adjusted grosses worldwide.'\n\nBefore its release, various film critics and fan communities predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, in line with predictions made for Cameron's previous blockbuster \"Titanic\". This criticism ranged from \"Avatar\"s film budget, to its concept and use of 3-D \"blue cat people\". \"Slate\" magazine's Daniel Engber complimented the 3D effects, but criticized them for reminding him of certain CGI characters from the \"Star Wars\" prequel films and for having the \"uncanny valley\" effect. \"The New York Times\" noted that 20th Century Fox executives had decided to release \"\" alongside \"Avatar\", calling it a \"secret weapon\" to cover any unforeseeable losses at the box-office.\nBox office analysts, on the other hand, estimated that the film would be a box office success. \"The holy grail of 3-D has finally arrived,\" said an analyst for Exhibitor Relations. \"This is why all these 3-D venues were built: for \"Avatar.\" This is the one. The behemoth.\" The \"cautionary estimate\" was that \"Avatar\" would bring in around $60 million in its opening weekend. Others guessed higher. There were also analysts who believed that the film's three-dimensionality would help its box office performance, given that recent 3D films had been successful.\n\nCameron said he felt the pressure of the predictions, but that pressure is good for film-makers. \"It makes us think about our audiences and what the audience wants,\" he stated. \"We owe them a good time. We owe them a piece of good entertainment.\" Although he felt \"Avatar\" would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target demographic, he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: \"If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience.\" Cameron was aware of the sentiment that \"Avatar\" would need significant \"repeat business\" just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed \"Avatar\" could inspire the same \"sharing\" reaction as \"Titanic\". He said that film worked because, \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it. They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life.\"\n\nAfter the film's release and unusually strong box office performance over its first two weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing \"Titanic\"s worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts. Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing \"Titanic\", such as 2008's \"The Dark Knight\", but \"Avatar\" was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. \"Most films are considered to be healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. \"This is just unprecedented. I had to do a double take. I thought it was a miscalculation.\" Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing \"Titanic\" because \"Today's films flame out much faster than they did when \"Titanic\" was released.\" Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, \"While \"Avatar\" may beat \"Titanic\"s record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass \"Titanic\" in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\" Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to \"try to topple \"Titanic\" off its perch\" because it \"just struck some kind of chord\" and there had been other good films in recent years. He changed his prediction by mid-January. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.\nAlthough analysts have been unable to agree that \"Avatar\"s success is attributable to one primary factor, several explanations have been advanced. First, January is historically \"the dumping ground for the year's weakest films\", and this also applied to 2010.\nCameron himself said he decided to open the film in December so that it would have less competition from then to January. \"Titanic\" capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998. Additionally, \"Avatar\" established itself as a \"must-see\" event. Gray said, \"At this point, people who are going to see \"Avatar\" are going to see \"Avatar\" and would even if the slate was strong.\" Marketing the film as a \"novelty factor\" also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theatres. \"It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home,\" stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com. The \"Oscar buzz\" surrounding the film and international viewings helped. \"Two-thirds of \"Titanic\"s haul was earned overseas, and \"Avatar\" [tracked] similarly ...\"Avatar\" opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them\", and the markets \"such as Russia, where \"Titanic\" saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than before.\n\nAccording to \"Variety\", films in 3D accumulated $1.3 billion in 2009, \"a threefold increase over 2008 and more than 10% of the total 2009 box-office gross\". The increased ticket price – an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets – helped the film. Likewise, \"Entertainment Weekly\" attributed the film's success to 3D glasses, but also to its \"astronomic word-of-mouth\". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but \"the buzz\" created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings. Gray said \"Avatar\" having no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. \"The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes,\" he said, \"but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films: \"Titanic\" (historical events), the \"Star Wars\" movies (an established film franchise), or \"The Lord of the Rings\" (literature). It was a tougher sell ...\"\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 83% based on 301 reviews, with a rating average of 7.5/10. The site's consensus reads \"It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but \"Avatar\" reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.\" On Metacritic — which assigns a weighted mean score — the film has a score of 83 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend revealed the average grade cinemagoers gave \"Avatar\" was \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Every demographic surveyed was reported to give this rating. These polls also indicated that the main draw of the film was its use of 3D.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" called the film \"extraordinary\" and gave it four stars out of four. \"Watching \"Avatar\", I felt sort of the same as when I saw \"Star Wars\" in 1977,\" he said, adding that like \"Star Wars\" and \"\", the film \"employs a new generation of special effects\" and it \"is not simply a sensational entertainment, although it is that. It's a technical breakthrough. It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message\".\nA. O. Scott of \"At The Movies\" also compared his viewing of the film to the first time he viewed \"Star Wars\" and he said \"although the script is a little bit ... obvious,\" it was \"part of what made it work\". Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" praised the film, saying \"The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in \"Avatar\", and it's very much a place worth visiting.\" Kirk Honeycutt of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave the film a positive review. \"The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention,\" he stated. Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" awarded \"Avatar\" a three-and-a-half out of four star rating and wrote in his print review \"It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just be as big as his dreams.\" Richard Corliss of \"Time\" magazine thought that the film was \"the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures.\" Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" thought the film has \"powerful\" visual accomplishments but \"flat dialogue\" and \"obvious characterization\". James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars; he wrote \"In 3-D, it's immersive – but the traditional film elements – story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc. – are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2-D version an engrossing 2½-hour experience.\"\n\n\"Avatar\"s underlying social and political themes attracted attention. Armond White of the \"New York Press\" wrote that Cameron used \"villainous American characters\" to \"misrepresent facets of militarism, capitalism, and imperialism\". Russell D. Moore of \"The Christian Post\" concluded that \"propaganda exists in the film\" and stated \"If you can get a theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war, then you've got some amazing special effects.\" Some commentators sympathetic to anarcho-primitivism have even praised the film as a manifesto for their cause. Adam Cohen of \"The New York Times\" was more positive about the film, calling its anti-imperialist message \"a 22nd-century version of the American colonists vs. the British, India vs. the Raj, or Latin America vs. United Fruit\". Ross Douthat of \"The New York Times\" opined that the film is \"Cameron's long apologia for pantheism [...] Hollywood's religion of choice for a generation now\", while Saritha Prabhu of \"The Tennessean\" called the film a \"misportrayal of pantheism and Eastern spirituality in general\", and Maxim Osipov of \"The Hindustan Times\", on the contrary, commended the film's message for its overall consistency with the teachings of Hinduism in the \"Bhagavad Gita\". Annalee Newitz of io9 concluded that \"Avatar\" is another film that has the recurring \"fantasy about race\" whereby \"some white guy\" becomes the \"most awesome\" member of a non-white culture. Michael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" called \"Avatar\" \"the season's ideological Rorschach blot\", while Miranda Devine of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" thought that \"It [was] impossible to watch Avatar without being banged over the head with the director's ideological hammer.\" Nidesh Lawtoo believed that an essential, yet less visible social theme that contributed to \"Avatar\"s success concerns contemporary fascinations with virtual avatars and \"the transition from the world of reality to that of virtual reality\".\n\nCritics and audiences have cited similarities with other films, literature or media, describing the perceived connections in ways ranging from simple \"borrowing\" to outright plagiarism. Ty Burr of \"The Boston Globe\" called it \"the same movie\" as \"Dances with Wolves\". Like \"Dances with Wolves\", \"Avatar\" has been characterized as being a \"white savior\" movie, in which a \"backwards\" native people is impotent without the leadership of a member of the invading white culture. Parallels to the concept and use of an avatar are in Poul Anderson's 1957 novelette \"Call Me Joe\", in which a paralyzed man uses his mind from orbit to control an artificial body on Jupiter. Cinema audiences in Russia have noted that \"Avatar\" has elements in common with the 1960s \"Noon Universe\" novels by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, which are set in the 22nd century on a forested world called Pandora with a sentient indigenous species called the Nave. Various reviews have compared \"Avatar\" to the films \"\", \"Pocahontas\" and \"The Last Samurai.\" NPR's \"Morning Edition\" has compared the film to a montage of tropes, with one commentator stating that \"Avatar\" was made by \"mixing a bunch of film scripts in a blender\". Gary Westfahl wrote that \"the science fiction story that most closely resembles \"Avatar\" has to be Ursula Le Guin's novella \"The Word for World Is Forest\" (1972), another epic about a benevolent race of alien beings who happily inhabit dense forests while living in harmony with nature until they are attacked and slaughtered by invading human soldiers who believe that the only good gook is a dead gook.\" The science fiction writer and editor Gardner Dozois said that along with the Anderson and Le Guin stories, the \"mash-up\" included Alan Dean Foster's 1975 novel, \"Midworld\". Some sources saw similarities to the artwork of Roger Dean, which featured fantastic images of floating rock formations and dragons. In 2013, Dean sued Cameron and Fox, claiming that Pandora was inspired by 14 of his images. Dean sought damages of $50m. Dean's case was dismissed in 2014, and \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted that Cameron has won multiple \"Avatar\" idea theft cases.\n\n\"Avatar\" received compliments from filmmakers, with Steven Spielberg praising it as \"the most evocative and amazing science-fiction movie since \"Star Wars\"\" and others calling it \"audacious and awe inspiring\", \"master class\", and \"brilliant\". Noted art director-turned-filmmaker Roger Christian is also a noted fan of the film. On the other hand, Duncan Jones said: \"It's not in my top three James Cameron films. ... [A]t what point in the film did you have any doubt what was going to happen next?\". For French filmmaker Luc Besson, \"Avatar\" opened the doors for him to now create an adaptation of the graphic novel series \"Valérian and Laureline\" that technologically supports the scope of its source material, with Besson even throwing his original script in the trash and redoing it after seeing the film. \"TIME\" ranked \"Avatar\" number 3 in their list of \"The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium (Thus Far)\" also earning it a spot on the magazine's All-TIME 100 list, and IGN listed \"Avatar\" as number 22 on their list of the top 25 Sci-Fi movies of all time.\n\n\"Avatar\" won the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for a total of nine, including Best Picture and Best Director. \"Avatar\" also won the 67th Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director, and was nominated for two others. At the 36th Saturn Awards, \"Avatar\" won all ten awards it was nominated for: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Music, Best Production Design and Best Special Effects.\n\nThe New York Film Critics Online honored the film with its Best Picture award. The film also won the Critics' Choice Awards of the Broadcast Film Critics Association for Best Action Film and several technical categories, out of nine nominations. It won two of the St. Louis Film Critics awards: Best Visual Effects and Most Original, Innovative or Creative Film. The film also won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for Production Design and Special Visual Effects, and was nominated for seven others, including Best Film and Director. The film has received numerous other major awards, nominations and honors.\n\nIn July 2010, Cameron confirmed that there would be an extended theatrical re-release of the film on , 2010, exclusively in 3D theaters and IMAX 3D. \"Avatar: Special Edition\" includes an additional nine minutes of footage, all of which is CG, including an extension of the sex scene and various other scenes that were cut from the original theatrical film. This extended re-release resulted in the film's run time approaching the current IMAX platter maximum of 170 minutes, thereby leaving less time for the end credits. Cameron stated that the nine minutes of added scenes cost more than a minute to produce and finish. During its 12-week re-release, \"Avatar: Special Edition\" grossed an additional $10.74 million in North America and $22.46 million overseas for a worldwide total of $33.2 million.\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in the US on , 2010 and in the UK on . The US release was not on a Tuesday as is the norm, but was done to coincide with Earth Day. The first DVD and Blu-ray release does not contain any supplemental features other than the theatrical film and the disc menu in favor of and to make space for optimal picture and sound. The release also preserves the film's native 1.78:1 () format as Cameron felt that was the best format to watch the film. The Blu-ray disc contains DRM (BD+ 5) which some Blu-ray players might not support without a firmware update.\n\n\"Avatar\" set a first-day launch record in the U.S. for Blu-ray sales at 1.5 million units sold, breaking the record previously held by \"The Dark Knight\" (600,000 units sold). First-day DVD and Blu-ray sales combined were over four million units sold. In its first four days of release, sales of \"Avatar\" on Blu-ray reached 2.7 million in the United States and Canada – overtaking \"The Dark Knight\" to become the best ever selling Blu-ray release in the region. The release later broke the Blu-ray sales record in the UK the following week. In its first three weeks of release, the film sold a total of DVD and Blu-ray discs combined, a new record for sales in that period. As of , 2012, DVD sales (not including Blu-ray) totaled over units sold with in revenue. \"Avatar\" retained its record as the top-selling Blu-ray in the US market until January 2015 when Disney's \"Frozen\" surpassed it.\n\nThe \"Avatar\" Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition on DVD and Blu-ray was released on , 2010. Three different versions of the film are present on the discs: the original theatrical cut, the special edition cut, and a collector's extended cut (with the DVD set spreading them on two discs, but the Blu-ray set presenting them on a single disc). The collector's extended cut contains 6 more minutes of footage, thus making it 16 minutes longer than the original theatrical cut. Cameron mentioned, \"you can sit down, and in a continuous screening of the film, watch it with the Earth opening\". He stated the \"Earth opening\" is an additional 4½ minutes of scenes that were in the film for much of its production but were ultimately cut before the film's theatrical release. The release also includes an additional 45 minutes of deleted scenes and other extras.\n\nCameron initially stated that \"Avatar\" would be released in 3D around , but the studio issued a correction: \"3-D is in the conceptual stage and \"Avatar\" will not be out on 3D Blu-ray in November.\" In , Fox stated that the 3D version would be released some time in 2011. It was later revealed that Fox had given Panasonic an exclusive license for the 3D Blu-ray version and only with the purchase of a Panasonic 3DTV. The length of Panasonic's exclusivity period is stated to last until . On , Cameron stated that the standalone 3D Blu-ray would be the final version of the film's home release and that it was, \"maybe one, two years out\". On Christmas Eve 2010, \"Avatar\" had its 3D television world premiere on Sky.\n\nOn August 13, 2012, Cameron announced on Facebook that \"Avatar\" would be released globally on Blu-ray 3D. The Blu-ray 3D version was finally released on October 16, 2012.\n\nTwo sequels to \"Avatar\" were initially confirmed after the success of the first film; this number was subsequently expanded to four. Their respective release dates are currently December 18, 2020, December 17, 2021, December 20, 2024, and December 19, 2025. Cameron is directing, producing and co-writing all four; Josh Friedman, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Shane Salerno all took a part in the writing process of all of the sequels before being assigned to finish the separate scripts, making the eventual writing credits for each film unclear.\n\nFilming for the first two sequels began in September 2017 and is expected to continue into 2018; the filming of the following two is expected to start as soon as \"Avatar 2\" and \"3\" wrap filming. Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Giovanni Ribisi, Joel David Moore, Dileep Rao, and CCH Pounder, are all reprising their roles, as are Stephen Lang and Matt Gerald, despite the deaths of their characters in the first film. Sigourney Weaver is also returning, although she stated that she would play a different character.\n\nNew cast members include Cliff Curtis and Kate Winslet as members of the Na'vi reef people of Metkayina, and Oona Chaplin as Varang, a \"strong and vibrant central character who spans the entire saga of the sequels\". Seven child actors will also portray pivotal new characters through the sequels: Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton and Trinity Bliss as Jake and Neytiri's children, Bailey Bass, Filip Geljo, and Duane Evans Jr. as free-divers of the Metkayina, and Jack Champion as a human.\n\nAlthough the last two sequels have been greenlit, Cameron stated in a November 26, 2017 interview: \"Let’s face it, if \"Avatar 2\" and \"3\" don’t make enough money, there’s not going to be a \"4\" and \"5\"\".\n\nOn November 14, 2018, Cameron announced filming on \"Avatar 2\" and \"3\" with the principal cast had been completed.\n\n\"Toruk - The First Flight\" is an original stage production by the Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil which premiered in November 2015 and has been touring other cities since 2016. Inspired by \"Avatar\", the story is set in Pandora's past, involving a prophecy concerning a threat to the Tree of Souls and a quest for totems from different tribes. Audience members can download an app in order to participate in show effects. On January 18, 2016, it was announced via the Toruk Facebook page that filming for an upcoming DVD has been completed and is currently undergoing editing.\n\nIn 2011, Cameron, Lightstorm, and Fox entered an exclusive licensing agreement with The Walt Disney Company to feature \"Avatar\"-themed attractions at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts worldwide, including a themed land for Disney's Animal Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The area, known as Pandora – The World of \"Avatar\", opened on May 27, 2017.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27118694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27118694", "title": "Barton Cylinder", "text": "Barton Cylinder\n\nThe Barton Cylinder is a Sumerian creation myth, written on a clay cylinder in the mid to late 3rd millennium BC, which is now in the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Joan Goodnick Westenholz suggests it dates to around 2400 BC (ED III).\n\nThe cylinder is inscribed with a Sumerian cuneiform mythological text, found at the site of Nippur in 1889 during excavations conducted by the University of Pennsylvania. The cylinder takes its name from George Barton, who was the first to publish a transcription and translation of the text in 1918 in \"Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions\". It is also referred to as University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Catalogue of the Babylonian Section (CBS) number 8383. Samuel Noah Kramer referred to it as \"The Nippur Cylinder\" and suggested it may date as far back as 2500 BC. The cylinder dates to the Old Babylonian period, but Falkenstein (1951) surmises that the composition was written in Archaic, pre-Ur III cuneiform, likely dating to the Akkad dynasty (c. 2300 BC). He concludes a non-written literary history that was characterised and repeated in future texts. Jan van Dijk concurs with this suggestion that it is a copy of a far older story predating neo-Sumerian times.\n\nThe most recent edition was published by Bendt Alster and Aage Westenholz in 1994. Jeremy Black calls the work \"a beautiful example of Early Dynastic calligraphy\" and discussed the text \"where primeval cosmic events are imagined.\" Along with Peeter Espak, he notes that Nippur is pre-existing before creation when heaven and earth separated. Nippur, he suggests is transfigured by the mythological events into both a \"scene of a mythic drama\" and a real place, indicating \"the location becomes a metaphor.\"\n\nBlack details the beginning of the myth: \"Those days were indeed faraway days. Those nights were indeed faraway nights. Those years were indeed faraway years. The storm roared, the lights flashed. In the sacred area of Nibru (Nippur), the storm roared, the lights flashed. Heaven talked with Earth, Earth talked with Heaven.\" The content of the text deals with Ninhursag, described by Bendt and Westenholz as the \"older sister of Enlil.\" The first part of the myth deals with the description of the sanctuary of Nippur, detailing a sacred marriage between An and Ninhursag during which heaven and earth touch. Piotr Michalowski says that in the second part of the text \"we learn that someone, perhaps Enki, made love to the mother goddess, Ninhursag, the sister of Enlil and planted the seed of seven (twins of) deities in her midst.\"\n\nThe Alster and Westenholz translation reads: \"Enlil's older sister / with Ninhursag / he had intercourse / he kissed her / the semen of seven twins / he planted in her womb\"\n\nPeeter Espak clarifies the text gives no proof of Enki's involvement, however he notes \"the motive described here seems to be similar enough to the intercourse conducted by Enki in the later myth \"Enki and Ninhursag\" for suggesting the same parties acting also in the Old-Sumerian myth.\"\n\nBarton's original translation and commentary suggested a primitive sense of religion where \"chief among these spirits were gods, who, however capricious, were the givers of vegetation and life.\" He discusses the text as a series of \"entreatments\" and \"appeals\" to the various provider and protector gods and goddesses, such as Enlil, in lines such as \"O divine lord, protect the little habitation.\" Barton suggests that several concepts within the text were later recycled in the much later biblical Book of Genesis. He describes Ninhursag in terms of a snake goddess who creates enchantments, incantations, and oils, to protect from demons, saying: \"Her counsels strengthen the wise divinity of An\", a statement which reveals a point of view similar to that of Genesis 3, () 'Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field.\" Barton also finds reference to the tree of life in the text, from which he claimed: \"As it stands the passage seems to imply a knowledge on the part of the Babylonians of a story kindred to that of Genesis (). However, in the absence of context one cannot build on this.\" Finding yet another parallel with Genesis, Barton mentions that \"The Tigris and Euphrates are twice spoken of as holy rivers – and the 'mighty abyss' (or 'well of the mighty abyss') is appealed-to for protection.\"\n\nHis translation reads: \"The holy Tigris, the holy Euphrates / the holy sceptre of Enlil / establish Kharsag.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Well formed generated collections generators and bisectors coincide, such as the perfect fifth (circle of fifths) in the diatonic collection. The term was introduced by Jay Rahn (1977), who considers any division between one and two thirds as approximately half (major third to minor sixth or 400 to 800 cents) and who applied the term only the equally spaced collections. Clough and Johnson both adapt the term to apply to generic scale steps. Rahn also uses aliquant bisector for bisectors which may be used to generate every note in a collection, in which case the bisector and the number of notes must be coprime. Bisectors may be used to produce the diatonic, harmonic minor, and ascending melodic minor collections. (Johnson 2003, p.97, 101, 158n10-12)\n\nThe diatonic scale may be derived from a chain of perfect fifths:\n\nFor example, the octatonic scale may be derived similarly to derivations of the diatonic scale by a chain of perfect fifths (a generator), by using a bisector of 5 scale steps (3 may also be used). However, five steps in the octatonic scale alternates between 7 and 8 semitones, so it is a bisector and not a generator:\n\n"}

{"id": "3251022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3251022", "title": "Cast Earth", "text": "Cast Earth\n\nCast Earth is a proprietary natural building material developed since the mid-1990s by Harris Lowenhaupt and Michael Frerking based on the earlier Turkish Alker, which is a concrete-like composite with soil of a suitable composition as its bulk component stabilized with about 15% calcined gypsum (plaster of Paris) instead of Portland cement. It can be used to form solid walls that need not be reinforced with a steel frame or timber framing, unless extra seismic reinforcement is necessary. Forms are set up and filled with Cast Earth, which sets quickly and solidly. Once the forms are removed the wall stays sound.\n\nCast Earth is often promoted as an environmentally friendly alternative to cast concrete. The Cast Earth slurry is poured in forms similar to concrete construction and is a suitable alternative to concrete walls in areas prone to hurricane damage. The technology has the potential to be able to compete against traditional wood frame construction in terms of cost. Cast Earth can also be installed with a lot less labor than most green alternatives, such as rammed earth. Since the product is proprietary, installation requires a crew trained by the Cast Earth company, leaving it out of reach of do-it-yourself builders. It is also not cost-effective for contractors unless they do a lot of Cast Earth installations. \n\nThe calcined gypsum sets quickly. When calcined gypsum is added to soil, the setting time is reduced even further, to mere minutes. Often this quick setting is too fast and a retardant must be added to the mix so it can be poured. In Alker, lime is added to extend working time to 20 minutes. Cast Earth uses another retardant for an even greater working time. This ingredient is proprietary and a carefully guarded secret. When the material is dry, it is similar to adobe in various ways, outperforming it in tensile strength, hardness, and erosion resistance. It also has less tendency to crack and shrink. Some Cast Earth walls do soak up water, however, depending upon the porosity of the earthen materials used. For example, decomposed granite tends to be prone to absorption if the eaves of the roof is inadequate or it is exposed to water for a prolonged time, i.e. days. Limestone materials however, tend to repel water once the walls are completely dried/cured.\n\n"}
{"id": "35623996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35623996", "title": "Clara (Mirbeau)", "text": "Clara (Mirbeau)\n\nClara is the main character in the French Novel \"\"The Torture Garden\"\" ( \"Le Jardin des supplices\", 1899), by Octave Mirbeau.\n\nClara, who has no last name or civil status, is an English woman with red hair and green eyes--“a greyish green of the young fruits of the almond tree.” Single, rich and bisexual, Clara lives near Canton, and leads an idle existence, entirely devoted to finding perverse pleasures. She is fully emancipated, financially and sexually, and freed from oppressive laws and taboos prevailing in the West and which, according to her critique of anarchist inspiration, prohibit the development of the individual. Clara thus claims to enjoy complete freedom. She particularly enjoys visiting the city prison every week, which is open to tourists on Wednesday. Clara delights in watching the death row inmates, many of whom are innocent or guilty of minor offenses, being brutally tortured and put to death.\n\nThis protagonist meets the anonymous narrator, a petty political crook, aboard the \"Saghalien\", where the pseudo-embryologist was sailing to Ceylon, as part of an official mission. In reality, his primary goal is just to distance himself from France. She seduces him, awakening his sexual desire along with the need to unburden himself, and becomes his mistress. She takes him with her to China, where both the narrator and Clara share a lover, Annie.\n\nTwo years later, the narrator, who had fled from Clara's pernicious embraces and went to Annam, returns. Clara regains her power over him and is pleased to dominate and humiliate him. She takes him to visit the torture garden of the prison, where they wander around. During a \"crescendo\" of horror, Clara experiences waves of ecstasy and has a hysterical fit. She then feels almost purified after climaxing. The scene takes place in a \"flower boat\", a floating brothel, where orgies take place. According to the narrator, the area is more like a place of punishment than a garden of delights. But, as Ki Pai, the boatman who regularly accompanies Clara, says, \"It will start all over again!\"\n\nThe enigmatic character of Clara, \"fairy of mass graves, angel of decomposition and decay\", seems to be based on pure fantasy, unrelated to a plausible reality that the novel would be expected to reproduce mimetically, to the point at which the narrator becomes haggard wondering whether she is not a figment of his imagination: \"Does she really exist?... I wonder, not without fear... Was she not born out of my debauchery and fever?... Is she like one of those impossible images, like a child in a nightmare? ... A criminal temptation, lust sparking the sick imaginations of murderers and madmen?... Could she be nothing but my soul, escaped outside of my body, despite myself, which materialized in the form of sin?... \"\n\nThis character is an illustration of a \"fin-de-siècle\" femme fatale, an all-powerful ghoul who treats men as puppets and enjoys their humiliation. Sadistic and voyeuristic, she experiences an intense and ever growing pleasure to view sophisticated executions, whose art was perfected by China, as opposed to industrial and technological massacres, which were practiced on a large scale in Europe without any concern for art. As Jean-Luc Planchais wrote, she is a \"bloody tribade who castrates ideals\", who \"believes herself to be God, the destruction of the other confirms her supremacy\".\n\nHowever, she is equally masochistic because she likes to imagine herself in the role of a victim whose suffering is an unparalleled source of ecstasy. For example, when witnessing the “iron rods” torture, she says, \"It felt like the rod entered the small of my back with every strike... It was atrocious and very sweet!\" Perverse, she is an apologist for \"lust\" in all its forms and sees it as \"the perfection of love\" because \"all the mental faculties of man are revealed and sharpened\" and that \"it is only by lust\" that can achieve \"development total personality. \" And it is through lust that she intends to initiate the shy narrator.\n\nThis character's perhaps monstrous values and claims seem totally at odds with the humanism of Octave Mirbeau, a defender of Alfred Dreyfus. However, one could make the argument that the novelist was using Clara's character as a means of denouncing English and French colonialism. The reader can only be disconcerted and uncomfortable and may lose his aesthetic and ethical bearings.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20777420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20777420", "title": "District 9", "text": "District 9\n\nDistrict 9 is a 2009 science fiction action film directed by Neill Blomkamp, written by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell, and produced by Peter Jackson and Carolynne Cunningham. It is a co-production of New Zealand, the United States, and South Africa. The film stars Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, and David James, and was adapted from Blomkamp's 2006 short film \"Alive in Joburg\".\n\nThe film is partially presented in a found footage format by featuring fictional interviews, news footage, and video from surveillance cameras. The story, which explores themes of humanity, xenophobia, and social segregation, begins in an alternate 1982, when an alien ship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa. When a population of sick and malnourished insect-like aliens is found aboard the ship, the South African government confines them to an internment camp called District 9. Years later, during the government's relocation of the aliens to another camp, one of the confined aliens named Christopher Johnson tries to escape with his son and return home, crossing paths with a bureaucrat named Wikus van der Merwe. The title and premise of \"District 9\" were inspired by events in Cape Town's District Six, during the apartheid era.\n\nA viral marketing campaign for the film began in 2008 at San Diego Comic-Con, while the theatrical trailer debuted in July 2009. \"District 9\" was released by TriStar Pictures on 14 August 2009, in North America and became a financial success, earning over $210 million at the box office. It also received acclaim from critics, who praised the film's direction, performances, themes, and story, and garnered numerous awards and nominations, including four Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing.\n\nIn 1982, an alien ship hovers over Johannesburg. When investigation teams enter, they discover a population of malnourished extraterrestrials, thereafter nicknamed \"prawns\". The South African government confines the aliens to District 9, a government camp. In 2010, following unrest between the aliens and locals, the government hires private military company Multinational United (MNU) to relocate the aliens to a new camp. Piet Smit, an MNU executive, appoints his son-in-law Wikus van de Merwe, a nebbish Afrikaner bureaucrat, to lead the relocation. The relocation uses bribes of cat food, which is addictive for the aliens.\n\nThree aliens—Christopher Johnson, his son, and a friend—are seen scavenging pieces of alien technology, from which they finish distilling a fluid which they collect in a small canister. During an inspection, Wikus discovers and confiscates the canister from the shack of Christopher's friend, but accidentally sprays some of the fluid onto his own face, which causes him to have a momentary seizure. Christopher's friend is subsequently killed by Koobus Venter, a mercenary soldier employed by MNU.\n\nWikus's body tissue begins to mutate into alien tissue. He is detained and transported to MNU headquarters for brutal experimentation, where researchers and officials discover that his chimeric DNA grants him the ability to use his transformed arm to wield alien weapons. When MNU doctors try to kill him by surgery to harvest his vital organs, Wikus overpowers them and escapes the facility. Venter and his men hunt Wikus down, while a smear story is broadcast, one that reaches his wife, Tania, claiming that Wikus is a wanted fugitive who has contracted a sexually transmitted disease from sex with prawns.\n\nWikus finds refuge in District 9 and learns that Christopher is hiding the command module of their spacecraft and the canister's fluid would be able to reactivate the command module and the dormant mothership. He claims he can reverse Wikus's mutation in the mothership. To recover the canister from MNU headquarters, Wikus obtains alien weapons from District 9 Nigerian arms dealer Obesandjo and his gang. They use these to assault the headquarters, retrieve the canister, and flee to District 9.\n\nUpon seeing the treatment of his people in the lab, Christopher decides to return to his home planet for help and explains that he cannot undo Wikus's mutation until he returns in three years. Enraged, Wikus knocks Christopher out and attempts to fly the command module to the mothership, but is almost immediately shot down by Venter and his men. They capture Wikus and Christopher, but Obesandjo's gang attacks the convoy and seize Wikus.\n\nChristopher's son remotely activates the mothership and an alien mechanized battle suit in Obesandjo's base that kills Obesandjo and his men. Wikus uses the suit to rescue Christopher, who promises to return in three years with a cure for Wikus. Wikus kills all the attacking soldiers before Venter cripples the suit, ejecting Wikus. As he corners a heavily injured Wikus, a group of aliens protect Wikus by killing Venter. The command module is lifted into the mothership and Christopher and his son leave Earth.\n\nA series of news broadcasts are shown about the potential return of the spacecraft and Wikus's whereabouts. MNU's illegal experiments are exposed and District 9 is demolished. Tania finds a metal flower on her doorstep, giving her hope that Wikus is still alive. The final scene shows a fully transformed Wikus in a junkyard, crafting a similar flower.\n\n\nLike \"Alive in Joburg\", the short film on which the feature film is based, the setting of \"District 9\" is inspired by historical events during the apartheid era, particularly alluding to District Six, an inner-city residential area in Cape Town, declared a \"whites only\" area by the government in 1966, with 60,000 people forcibly removed to Cape Flats, away. The film also refers to contemporary evictions and forced removals to suburban ghettos in post-apartheid South Africa, as well as the resistance of its residents. This includes the high-profile attempted forced removal of the Joe Slovo informal settlement in Cape Town to temporary relocation areas in Delft, plus evictions in the shack settlement, Chiawelo, where the film was actually shot. Blikkiesdorp, a temporary relocation area in Cape Town, has also been compared with the \"District 9\" camp earning a front-page spread in the \"Daily Voice\".\n\nThe film emphasizes the irony of Wikus and the impact of his experiences on his personality, which show him becoming more humane as he becomes less biologically human. Chris Mikesell from the University of Hawaii newspaper \"Ka Leo\" writes that \"Substitute 'black,' 'Asian,' 'Mexican,' 'illegal,' 'Jew,' or any number of different labels for the word 'prawn' in this film and you will hear the hidden truth behind the dialogue\".\n\nThemes of racism and xenophobia are shown in the form of speciesism. Used to describe the aliens, the word \"prawn\" is a reference to the Parktown prawn, a king cricket species considered a pest in South Africa. Copley has said that the theme is not intended to be the main focus of the work, but can work at a subconscious level even if it is not noticed.\n\nDuane Dudek of the \"Journal Sentinel\" wrote that \"The result is an action film about xenophobia, in which all races of humans are united in their dislike and mistrust of an insect-like species\".\n\nAnother underlying theme in \"District 9\" is states' reliance on multinational corporations (whose accountability is unclear and whose interests are not necessarily congruent with democratic principles) as a form of government-funded enforcement. As MNU represents the type of corporation which partners with governments, the negative portrayal of MNU in the film depicts the dangers of outsourcing militaries and bureaucracies to private contractors.\n\nProducer Peter Jackson planned to produce a film adaptation based on the \"Halo\" video-game franchise with first-time director Neill Blomkamp. Due to a lack of financing, the \"Halo\" adaptation was placed on hold. Jackson and Blomkamp discussed pursuing alternative projects and eventually chose to produce and direct, respectively, \"District 9\". Blomkamp had previously directed commercials and short films, but \"District 9\" was his first feature film. The director co-wrote the script with his wife, Terri Tatchell, and chose to film in South Africa, where he was born.\n\nIn \"District 9\", Tatchell and Blomkamp returned to the world explored in his short film \"Alive in Joburg\", choosing characters, moments and concepts that they found interesting including the documentary-style filmmaking, staged interviews, alien designs, alien technology/mecha suits, and the parallels to racial conflict and segregation in South Africa, and fleshing out these elements for the feature film.\n\nQED International financed the negative cost. After the 2007 American Film Market, QED partnered with Sony's TriStar Pictures for distribution in several territories.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Chiawelo, Soweto during a time of violent unrest in Alexandra (Gauteng) and other South African townships involving clashes between native South Africans and Africans born in other countries. The location that portrays \"District 9\" in itself was in fact a real impoverished neighborhood from which people were being forcibly relocated to government-subsidised housing. Several scenes were shot at the Ponte building.\n\nFilming for \"District 9\" took place during the winter in Johannesburg, South Africa. According to director Neill Blomkamp, during the winter season, Johannesburg \"actually looks like Chernobyl\", a \"nuclear apocalyptic wasteland\". Blomkamp wanted to capture the deserted, bleak atmosphere and environment, so he and the crew had to film during the months of June through July. The film took a total of 60 days of shooting. Filming in December raised another issue in that there was much more rain. Due to the rain, there was a lot of greenery to work with, which Blomkamp did not want. In fact, Blomkamp had to cut some of the vegetation in the scenery to portray the setting as desolate and dark.\n\nThe film features many weapons and vehicles produced by the South African arms industry, including the R5 and Vektor CR-21 assault rifles, Denel NTW-20 20 mm anti-materiel rifle, BXP submachine gun, Casspir armoured personnel carrier, Ratel infantry fighting vehicle, Rooikat armored fighting vehicle, Atlas Oryx helicopter and militarized Toyota Hilux \"technical\" pickup truck.\n\nBlomkamp said no single film influenced \"District 9\", but cited the 1980s \"hardcore sci-fi/action\" films such as \"Alien\", \"Aliens\", \"The Terminator\", \"\", \"Predator\" and \"RoboCop\" as subconscious influences. The director said, \"I don't know whether the film has that feeling or not for the audience, but I wanted it to have that harsh 1980s kind of vibe—I didn't want it to feel glossy and slick.\"\n\nBecause of the amount of hand-held shooting required for the film, the producers and crew decided to shoot using the digital Red One 4K camera. Cinematographer Trent Opaloch used nine digital Red Ones owned by Peter Jackson for primary filming. According to HD Magazine, \"District 9\" was shot on RED One cameras using build 15, Cooke S4 primes and Angenieux zooms. The documentary-style and CCTV-style cam footage was shot on the Sony EX1/EX3 XDCAM-HD. Additionally, the post-production team was warned that the most RED Camera footage they could handle a day was about an hour and a half. When that got to five hours a day reinforcements were called in and 120 terabytes of data was filled.\n\nAlready as a young child living in South Africa, Blomkamp was captivated by artwork and visual effects. \"I knew I wanted to be in movies … So I thought I wanted to be in special effects, like model-making and prosthetic effects.\" The combination of knowing he would find a career in the visual effects area and the advancement of technology allowing better computer graphics capabilities led him to work at a Canadian post-production company as a visual effects artist. The aliens in \"District 9\" were designed by Weta Workshop, and the design was executed by Image Engine.\n\nBlomkamp wanted the aliens to maintain both humanistic and barbaric features in the design of the creatures. According to Terri Tatchell, the director's writing partner, \"They are not appealing, they are not cute, and they don't tug at our heartstrings. He went for a scary, hard, warrior-looking alien, which is much more of a challenge.\" The look of the alien, with its exoskeleton-crustacean hybrid and crab-like shells, was meant to initially evoke a sense of disgust from viewers but as the story progresses, the audience was meant to sympathize with these creatures who had such human-like emotions and characteristics. Blomkamp established criteria for the design of the aliens. He wanted the species to be insect-like but also bipedal. The director wanted the audience to relate to the aliens and said of the restriction on the creature design, \"Unfortunately, they had to be human-esque because our psychology doesn't allow us to really empathize with something unless it has a face and an anthropomorphic shape. Like if you see something that's four-legged, you think it's a dog; that's just how we're wired ... If you make a film about an alien force, which is the oppressor or aggressor, and you don't want to empathize with them, you can go to town. So creatively that's what I wanted to do but story-wise, I just couldn't.\"\n\nBlomkamp originally sought to have Weta Digital design the creatures, but the company was busy with effects for \"Avatar\". The director then decided to choose a Vancouver-based effects company because he anticipated making films there in the future and because British Columbia offered a tax credit. Blomkamp met with Image Engine and considered them \"a bit of a gamble\" since the company had not pursued a project as large as a feature film. Aside from the aliens appearing on the operating table in the medical lab, all of them were created using CGI visual effects.\n\nWeta Digital designed the 2½-kilometre-diameter mothership and the drop ship, while the exo-suit and the little pets were designed by The Embassy Visual Effects. Zoic Studios performed overflow 2D work. On-set live special effects were created by MXFX.\n\nThe music for \"District 9\" was scored by Canadian composer Clinton Shorter, who spent three weeks preparing for the film. Director Neill Blomkamp wanted a \"raw and dark\" score, but one that maintained its South African roots. This was a challenge for Shorter, who found much of the South African music he worked with to be optimistic and joyful. Unable to get the African drums to sound dark and heavy, Shorter used a combination of taiko drums and synthesized instruments for the desired effects, with the core African elements of the score conveyed in the vocals and smaller percussion. Both the score and soundtrack feature music and vocals from Kwaito artists.\n\nSony Pictures launched a \"Humans Only\" marketing campaign to promote \"District 9\". Sony's marketing team designed its promotional material to emulate the segregational billboards that appear throughout the film. Billboards, banners, posters, and stickers were thus designed with the theme in mind, and the material was spread across public places such as bus stops in various cities, including \"humans only\" signs in certain locations and providing toll-free numbers to report \"non-human\" activity. This marketing strategy was designed to provoke reactions in its target audience, namely: sci-fi fans, and people concerned with social justice. Hence the overtly obvious use of fake segregational propaganda.\nAccording to Dwight Caines, Sony's president of digital marketing, an estimated 33,000 phone calls were made to the toll-free numbers during a two-week period with 2,500 of them leaving voicemails with reports of alien sightings. Promotional material was also presented at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, advertising the website D-9.com, which had an application presented by the fictional Multi-National United (MNU). The website had a local alert system for Johannesburg (the film's setting), news feeds, behavior recommendations, and rules and regulations. Other viral websites for the film were also launched, including an MNU website with a countdown timer for the film's release, an anti-MNU blog run by fictional alien character Christopher Johnson, and an MNU-sponsored educational website. An online game for \"District 9\" has also been made where players can choose to be a human or an alien. Humans are MNU agents on patrol trying to arrest or kill aliens. Aliens try to avoid capture from MNU agents whilst searching for alien canisters. This digital approach to marketing follows a rising trend among digital natives who develop marketing trends and techniques which are appropriate to the digital age, and is cost-efficient due to its reliance on social media and communications. This breaking down, and circumvention of existing marketing structures follows postmodernist theory in cinema.\n\nWETA released in July 2010 Christopher Johnson and Son as sculptures.\n\nAccording to the American Humane Association, the film displays an unauthorized \"no animals were harmed\" end credit, which is a registered trademark of the group.\n\n\"District 9\" grossed US$210.8 million, including US$115.6 million from the United States and Canada, against a production budget of US$30 million.\n\nIt opened in 3,048 theatres in Canada and the United States on 14 August 2009, and the film ranked first at the weekend box office with an opening gross of US$37.4 million. Among comparable science fiction films in the past, its opening attendance was slightly less than the 2008 film \"Cloverfield\" and the 1997 film \"Starship Troopers\". The audience demographic for \"District 9\" was 64 percent male and 57 percent people 25 years or older. The film stood out as a summer film that generated strong business despite little-known casting. Its opening success was attributed to the studio's unusual marketing campaign. In the film's second weekend, it dropped 49% in revenue while competing against the opening film \"Inglourious Basterds\" for the male audience, as Sony Pictures attributed the \"good hold\" to \"District 9\"s strong playability.\n\nThe film enjoyed similar success in the UK with an opening gross of £2,288,378 showing at 447 cinemas. It was just as popular in South Africa, where it was filmed on location.\n\nRotten Tomatoes reported that 90% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on a sample of 302 reviews, with an average score of 7.8/10. The website's consensus states, \"Technically brilliant and emotionally wrenching, \"District 9\" has action, imagination, and all the elements of a thoroughly entertaining science-fiction classic.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received a score of 81 based on 36 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nSara Vilkomerson of \"The New York Observer\" wrote, \"\"District 9\" is the most exciting science fiction movie to come along in ages; definitely the most thrilling film of the summer; and quite possibly the best film I've seen all year.\" Christy Lemire from the Associated Press was impressed by the plot and thematic content, claiming that \"\"District 9\" has the aesthetic trappings of science fiction but it's really more of a character drama, an examination of how a man responds when he's forced to confront his identity during extraordinary circumstances.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Lisa Schwarzbaum described it as \"... madly original, cheekily political, [and] altogether exciting ...\"\n\nRoger Ebert praised the film for \"giving us aliens to remind us not everyone who comes in a spaceship need be angelic, octopod or stainless steel\", but complained that \"the third act is disappointing, involving standard shoot-out action. No attempt is made to resolve the situation, and if that's a happy ending, I've seen happier. Despite its creativity, the film remains space opera and avoids the higher realms of science-fiction.\" Josh Tyler of Cinema Blend says the film is unique in interpretation and execution, but considers it to be a knockoff of the 1988 film \"Alien Nation\".\n\nIGN listed \"District 9\" at #24 on a list of the Top 25 Sci-Fi Films of All Time.\n\nNigeria's Information Minister Dora Akunyili asked movie theatres around the country to either ban the film or edit out specific references to the country, because of the film's negative depiction of the Nigerian characters as criminals and cannibals. Letters of complaint were sent to the producer and distributor of the film demanding an apology. She also said the gang leader Obesandjo is almost identical in spelling and pronunciation to the surname of former president Olusegun Obasanjo. The film was later banned in Nigeria; the Nigerian Film and Video Censors Board was asked to prevent cinemas from showing the film and also to confiscate it.\n\nHakeem Kae-Kazim, a Nigerian-born British actor also criticized the portrayal of Nigerians in the film, telling the \"Beeld\" (the leading Afrikaans-language daily newspaper): \"Africa is a beautiful place and the problems it does have can not be shown by such a small group of people.\"\n\nHowever, the Malawian actor Eugene Khumbanyiwa, who played Obesandjo, has stated that the Nigerians in the cast of \"District 9\" were not perturbed by the portrayal of Nigerians in the film, and that the film should not be taken literally: \"It's a story, you know. It's not like Nigerians do eat aliens. Aliens don't even exist in the first place.\"\n\nTeju Cole, a Nigerian-American writer, has commented that the \"one-dimensionality of the Nigerian characters is striking,\" even when taking into account the fact that \"District 9\" is meant to be a fable. He suggests two possible explanations for Blomkamp's narrative choice: first, that it is meant to reflect anti-foreigner sentiment within South Africa, or second, that it simply represents an oversight on Blomkamp's part.\n\nIn 2013, the movie was one of several discussed by David Sirota in \"Salon.com\" in an article concerning white savior narratives in film.\n\nAlexandra Heller Nicholas discusses Wikus's self-identity in District 9 as problematic due to him being a white man and the hero of the film. Nicholas argues that a white savior \"disempowers the film’s allegory to apartheid that comments on the corruption of the South African government\" as well as the discrimination black South-Africans dealt with during and post-apartheid. Making Wikus the \"white savior\" backtracks from the main message of \"District 9\" which is to show the audience the detrimental effects \"of colonialism brought by the Western world\". Another point Nicholas makes is that \"District 9\" is a \"stereotypical White Savior film\". She states that the plot is about a white man working for the government, who has roots \"in South Africa's apartheid culture\", involuntarily joins the \"victims of apartheid\". In this case, instead of black people, it's prawns.\n\nDoctor Shohini Chauduri wrote that \"District 9\" even echoes apartheid in its title, as it is reminiscent \"of District 6 in Cape Town, declared a whites-only area under the Group Areas Act…\" She also discusses how the wide shots used in \"District 9\" strongly emphasize the idea of exclusion under apartheid. The separation of people and \"prawns\" into human and non-human zones mark South Africa's social divisions.\n\n\"District 9\" was named one of the top 10 independent films of 2009 by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures. The film received four Academy Awards nominations for: Best Motion Picture of the Year (Peter Jackson, Carolynne Cunningham), Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay (Neill Blomkamp, Terri Tatchell), Best Achievement in Film Editing (Julian Clarke), Best Achievement in Visual Effects (Dan Kaufman, Peter Muyzers, Robert Habros, Matt Aitken); seven British Academy Film Awards nominations: Best Cinematography (Trent Opaloch), Best Screenplay – Adapted (Neill Blomkamp, Terri Tatchell), Best Editing (Julian Clarke), Best Production Design (Philip Ivey, Guy Potgieter), Best Sound (Brent Burge, Chris Ward, Dave Whitehead, Michael Hedges, Ken Saville), Best Special Visual Effects (Dan Kaufman, Peter Muyzers, Robert Habros, Matt Aitken), Best Director (Neill Blomkamp); five Broadcast Film Critics Association nominations: Best Makeup (Won), Best Screenplay, Adapted (Neill Blomkamp, Terri Tatchell), Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Action Movie; and one Golden Globe nomination: Best Screenplay – Motion Picture (Neill Blomkamp, Terri Tatchell).\n\nIt is the fifth TriStar Pictures film ever nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards (the previous four were \"As Good as It Gets\", \"Jerry Maguire\", \"Bugsy\" and \"Places in the Heart\"). It won the 2009 Bradbury Award from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.\n\nThe Blu-ray Disc and region 1 code widescreen edition of \"District 9\" as well as the 2-disc special-edition version on DVD was released on 22 December 2009. The DVD and Blu-ray Disc includes the documentary \"The Alien Agenda: A Filmmaker's Log\" and the special features \"Metamorphosis: The Transformation of Wikus\", \"Innovation: Acting and Improvisation\", \"Conception and Design: Creating the World of District 9\", and \"Alien Generation: Visual Effects\". The demo for the video game \"God of War III\" featured in the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo is also included with the Blu-ray release of \"District 9\" playable on the Sony PlayStation 3.\n\nOn 1 August 2009, two weeks before \"District 9\" was released to cinemas, Neill Blomkamp hinted that he intended to make a sequel if the film was successful enough. During an interview on the \"Rude Awakening\" 94.7 Highveld Stereo breakfast radio show, he alluded to it, saying \"There probably will be.\" Nevertheless, he revealed that his next project is unrelated to the \"District 9\" universe.\nIn an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Blomkamp stated that he was \"totally\" hoping for a follow-up: \"I haven't thought of a story yet but if people want to see another one, I'd love to do it.\"\nBlomkamp has posed the possibility of the next movie in the series being a prequel.\nIn an interview with \"Empire\" magazine posted on 28 April 2010, Sharlto Copley suggested that a follow-up, while very likely, would be about two years away, given his and Neill Blomkamp's current commitments.\n\nIn an interview with IGN in June 2013, Blomkamp said, \"I really want to make a \"District 9\" sequel. I genuinely do. The problem is I have a bunch of ideas and stuff that I want to make. I'm relatively new to this—I'm about to make my third film, and now the pattern that I'm starting to realise is very true is that you lock yourself into a film beyond the film you're currently working on. But it just doesn't work for me.\" Referring to a potential sequel, Blomkamp said \"[he] want[s] to make \"District 10\" at some point\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "944016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=944016", "title": "Fartlek", "text": "Fartlek\n\nFartlek, which means \"speed play\" in Swedish, is continuous training with interval training. Fartlek runs are a very simple form of a long distance run. Fartlek training “is simply defined as periods of fast running intermixed with periods of slower running.\" For some people, this could be a mix of jogging and sprinting, but for beginners it could be walking with jogging sections added in when possible. A simple example of what a runner would do during a fartlek run is “sprint all out from one light pole to the next, jog to the corner, give a medium effort for a couple of blocks, jog between four light poles and sprint to a stop sign, and so on, for a set total time or distance.\" The variable intensity and continuous nature of the exercise places stress on both the aerobic and anaerobic systems. It differs from traditional interval training in that it is unstructured; intensity and/or speed varies, as the athlete wishes. Fartlek training is generally associated with running, but can include almost any kind of exercise.\n\nSwedish coach Gösta Holmér developed fartlek in 1937, and, since then, many physiologists have adopted it. It was designed for the downtrodden Swedish cross country running teams that had been beaten throughout the 1920s by Paavo Nurmi and the Finns. Holmér's plan used a faster-than-race pace and concentrated on both speed and endurance training.\n\nThis is the first session that was designed by Gösta Holmér for a cross country (multi-terrain) runner. This is also an example of what a fartlek session might look like, but fartlek sessions should be designed for an athlete's own event or sport, as well as catering to their individual needs. Sessions should be at an intensity that causes the athlete to work at 60% to 80% of his or her maximum heart rate. This should mean that the body will not experience too much discomfort while exercising. An athlete should also include a good warm up at the beginning of the session, and a cool down at the end of the session, to improve performance, minimize post-workout muscle soreness, to decrease the chances of injury and for other reasons.\n\nRunners hypothetically “run hard for two mailboxes, recover for three, run hard for three, recover for two.\" When executing this type, the runner continues like this for the allotted time or distance determined. \n\nRunners speed up when they get close to a dog in order to pass them; after passing the dog, they would then slow down for the recovery period. \n\nMany runners use music while they run. Runners can use their music as a template for their fartlek run by changing their speed according to different parts of a song. For example, they can speed up during the chorus and slow down for the rest of the song.\n\nIn order to add more variety and complexity, runners can add another speed into the run. Within any run, “there is no reason why three different paces should not be included.\" This would change a normal fartlek by doing a jog, run, and a full out sprint.\n\nSteve Moneghetti (Mona) devised this session with his coach Chris Wardlaw over the phone back in 1983 when he was just 20. He wanted a solid fartlek session, one that would help improve his speed as well as endurance and stimulate an ability to change pace mid-run, something that helped later on his career when competing against African athletes, who tended to speed up mid-race. A session would consist of: 2×90sec, 4×60sec, 4×30sec, 4×15sec with a slower tempo for recovery of the same time between each repetition. The session takes 20 minutes in total.\n\nSince this workout is very easily manipulated, “fartlek training allows you to add an endless variety of intervals to your aerobic workouts, which helps to keep you stimulated.\" A great plus to performing this workout is the variety it adds to fitness regimens; it is possible to change the amount of distance, time, fast bursts, recovery periods, and even the time at which you do each component.\n\nFor competitive runners, fartleks and all other types of interval runs are the key for race day readiness. The alternating speeds that are the defining point of fartleks allow runners to work “both the aerobic and anaerobic training systems while simulating the ebb and flow nature of competitive running.\" \n\nFartleks keep runners' bodies at top shape so that they can keep racing. Putting fartlek runs in a workout routine keeps “muscles, tendons, nerves, etc. used in running going at top capacity.\" In other words, regularly implementing fartleks keeps your body strong enough to maintain the mechanics of racing.\n\nBy alternating the “intensity of your workouts, you will burn more calories than you would by keeping a steady pace.\" While running, the runner's body first burns the stored sugars and then begins to burn fat after the sugar is depleted. During a fartlek workout while the body is trying to replace the sugar storage, “fat stores are burned in a metabolic effect that lasts long after your workout.\" Fartleks are a great option for people that run for their health because the fat burning portion makes it a very efficient exercise.\n\nFartleks can be specially tailored to fit the needs of different types of athletes. An example includes basketball, where “you must exert maximum effort while running a fast break, while you exert very little effort while standing at the foul line.\" It is possible to alter the type and timing of the fartlek in order to mimic the intensity of an average basketball game. This can be done for other sports such as tennis, soccer, and football as well.\n\nComparable runs include the traditional interval training, tempo runs, and ladders. These workouts are very similar to fartleks, but there are slight differences that distinguish one from another.\n\nTempo runs are typically run for 20 to 25 minutes at a 6 or 7 RPE. This exercise is “like an Oreo cookie, with the warmup and cooldown as the cookie, and a run at an effort at or slightly above your anaerobic threshold (the place where your body shifts to using more glycogen for energy) as the filling.\" What runners do here is warm up at a slow and steady pace, then run harder than they would on a normal distance jog for an allotted amount of time, and then do a cool down with a very similar speed to the warm up. \n\nIntervals “are short, intense efforts followed by equal or slightly longer recovery time.\" By the end of a short burst of speed, the runner is barely able to keep up that pace. Unlike fartleks, interval runs are much more structured; usually running the fast and slow spurts at exact times or distances. Interval runs and tempo runs differ in the fact that tempo runs maintain a slightly fast pace for a set amount of time, while interval runs consist of alternating between sprints and slow sections instead of keeping one speed.\n\nThis workout is defined as “a speed workout in which the fast parts vary in length.\" Basically, athletes will run a small amount at a hard pace, work their way up, and work their way back down with timed breaks in between. Ladders are similar to interval training in that they require more structure, but they are different because the faster speed sections vary in time or distance. Although ladders are most similar to interval runs, the fact that the portions performed at the faster speed vary in length or time mirrors fartlek runs.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15669381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15669381", "title": "History of ballet", "text": "History of ballet\n\nBallet is a formalized form of dance with its origins in the Italian Renaissance courts of 15th and 16th centuries. Ballet spread from Italy to France with the help of Catherine de' Medici, where ballet developed even further under her aristocratic influence. An early example of Catherine's development of ballet is through 'Le Paradis d' Amour', a piece of work presented at her daughter's wedding, Marguerite de Valois to Henry of Navarre. Aristocratic money was responsible for the initial stages of development in 'court ballet', as it was royal money that dictated the ideas, literature and music used in ballets that were created to primarily entertain the aristocrats of the time. The first formal 'court ballet' ever recognized was staged in 1573, 'Ballet des Polonais'. In true form of royal entertainment, 'Ballet des Polonais' was commissioned by Catherine de' Medici to honor the Polish ambassadors who were visiting Paris upon the accession of Henry of Anjou to the throne of Poland. In 1581, Catherine de' Medici commissioned another court ballet, \"Ballet Comique de la Reine\", however it was her compatriot, Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx, who organized the ballet. Catherine de' Medici and Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx were responsible for presenting the first court ballet ever to apply the principles of Baif's Academie, by integrating poetry, dance, music and set design to convey a unified dramatic storyline. Moreover, the early organization and development of 'court ballet' was funded by, influenced by and produced by the aristocrats of the time, fulfilling both their personal entertainment and political propaganda needs.\n\nIn the late 17th century Louis XIV founded the Académie Royale de Musique (the Paris Opera) within which emerged the first professional theatrical ballet company, the Paris Opera Ballet. The predominance of French in the vocabulary of ballet reflects this history. Theatrical ballet soon became an independent form of art, although still frequently maintaining a close association with opera, and spread from the heart of Europe to other nations. The Royal Danish Ballet and the Imperial Ballet of the Russian Empire were founded in the 1740s and began to flourish, especially after about 1850. In 1907 the Russian ballet in turn moved back to France, where the Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev and its successors were particularly influential. Soon ballet spread around the world with the formation of new companies, including London's The Royal Ballet (1931), the San Francisco Ballet (1933), American Ballet Theatre (1937), The Royal Winnipeg Ballet (1939), The Australian Ballet (1940), the New York City Ballet (1948), the National Ballet of Canada (1951), and the National Ballet Academy and Trust of India (2002).\n\nIn the 20th century styles of ballet continued to develop and strongly influence broader concert dance, for example, in the United States choreographer George Balanchine developed what is now known as neoclassical ballet, subsequent developments have included contemporary ballet and post-structural ballet, for example seen in the work of William Forsythe in Germany.\n\nThe etymology of the word \"ballet\" reflects its history. The word \"ballet\" comes from French and was borrowed into English around the 17th century. The French word in turn has its origins in Italian \"balletto\", a diminutive of \"ballo\" (dance). \"Ballet\" ultimately traces back to Italian \"ballare\", meaning \"to dance\".\n\nBallet originated in the Renaissance court as an outgrowth of court pageantry in Italy, where aristocratic weddings were lavish celebrations. Tutus, ballet slippers and pointe work were not yet used. The choreography was adapted from court dance steps. Performers dressed in fashions of the times. For women that meant formal gowns that covered their legs to the ankle. Early ballet was participatory, with the audience joining the dance towards the end.\n\nDomenico da Piacenza (c. 1400–c. 1470) was one of the first dancing masters. Along with his students, Antonio Cornazzano and Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro, he was trained in dance and responsible for teaching nobles the art. Da Piacenza left one work: \" De arte saltandi et choreus ducendi\" (On the art of dancing and conducting dances), which was put together by his students.\n\nIn 1489 Galeazzo, Duke of Milan, married Isabella of Aragon in Tortona. An elaborate dance entertainment was arranged for the celebrations by the Italian dance master Bergonzio di Botta. The dances were linked by a slim narrative concerning Jason and the Argonauts, and each corresponded to a different course for the dinner. Tristano Calco of Milan wrote about the event, and it was considered so impressive, that many similar spectacles were \norganized elsewhere.\n\nBallet was further shaped by the French \"ballet de cour\", which consisted of social dances performed by the nobility in tandem with music, speech, verse, song, pageant, decor and costume. When Catherine de' Medici, an Italian aristocrat with an interest in the arts, married the French crown heir Henry II, she brought her enthusiasm for dance to France and provided financial support. Catherine's glittering entertainments supported the aims of court politics and usually were organized around mythological themes. The first \"ballet de cour\" was the \"Ballet de Polonais.\" This Ballet was performed in 1573 on the occasion of the visit of the Polish Ambassador. It was choreographed by Balthasar de Beaaujoyeulx and featured an hour-long dance for sixteen women, each representing a French province. \"Ballet Comique de la Reine\" (1581), which was also choreographed and directed by Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx, was commissioned by Louise of Lorraine, queen consort of King Henry III, son of Catherine, to celebrate the marriage of Henry's favorite the Duke de Joyeuse to Marguerite de Lorraine, the sister of Queen Louise. The ballet lasted for more than five hours and was danced by twenty four dancers: twelve naiades and twelve pages.\n\nIn the same year, the publication of Fabritio Caroso's \"Il Ballarino\", a technical manual on court dancing, both performance and social, helped to establish Italy as a centre of technical ballet development.\n\nBallet developed as a performance-focused art form in France during the reign of Louis XIV, who was passionate about dance. Pierre Beauchamp, the man who codified the five basic positions of the feet in ballet, was the king's personal dance teacher and favorite partner in \"ballet de cour\" in the 1650s. In 1661 Louis XIV, who was determined to reverse a decline in dance standards that began in the 17th century, established the Académie Royale de Danse. Beauchamp was appointed \"Intendant des ballets du roi\" and in 1680 became the director of the dance academy, a position he held until 1687.\n\nJean-Baptiste Lully, an Italian violinist, dancer, choreographer, and composer, who joined the court of Louis XIV in 1652, played a significant role in establishing the general direction ballet would follow for the next century. Supported and admired by King Louis XIV, Lully often cast the king in his ballets. The title of \"Sun King\" for the French monarch, originated in Louis XIV's role in Lully's \"Ballet de la Nuit\" (1653). The fourteen-year-old Louis XIV danced five roles in this 12-hour ballet. This Ballet was lavish and featured a scene where a set piece of a house was burned down, included witches, werewolves, gypsies, shepherds, thieves, and the goddesses Venus and Diana. Lully's main contribution to ballet were his nuanced compositions. His understanding of movement and dance allowed him to compose specifically for ballet, with musical phrasings that complemented physical movements. Lully also collaborated with the French playwright Molière. Together, they took an Italian theatre style, the \"commedia dell'arte\", and adapted it into their work for a French audience, creating the \"comédie-ballet\". Among their greatest productions, with Beauchamp as the choreographer, was \"Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme\" (1670).\n\nIn 1669 Louis XIV founded the Académie d'Opéra with Pierre Perrin as director. Louix XIV retired in 1670, largely because of excessive weight gain. Earlier, in 1661 he had founded a school, the \"Adacemie Royale de danse\". Beauchamp was the first ballet-master of the Opéra and created the dances for the new company's first production \"Pomone\" with music by Robert Cambert. Later, after Perrin went bankrupt, the king reestablished the Opéra as the Académie royale de Musique and made Lully the director. Beauchamp was one of the principal choreographers. In this position Lully, with his librettist Philippe Quinault, created a new genre, the \"tragédie en musique\", each act of which featured a \"divertissement\" that was a miniature ballet scene. With almost all his important creations Jean-Baptiste Lully brought together music and drama with Italian and French dance elements. His work created a legacy which would define the future of ballet.\n\nFrance's court was in some ways the leading source of fashionable culture for many other royal courts in Europe. Styles of entertainment were imitated, including the royal ballets. Courts in Spain, Portugal, Poland, Germany, and elsewhere all became audiences and participants in ballets. In addition to France, Italy became an important influence on the art form, predominantly Venice.\n\nProfessional ballet troupes began to organize and tour Europe, performing for aristocratic audiences. In Poland, King Władysław IV Vasa (1633–1648) hosted Italian opera productions, which included ballet performers in some scenes. The famous European ballet-masters who worked for the Polish court include Louis de Poitiers, Charles Duparc, Jean Favier, Antoine Pitrot, Antonio Sacco and Francesco Caselli.\n\nThe 18th century was a period of advance in the technical standards of ballet and the period when ballet became a serious dramatic art form on par with the opera. Central to this advance was the seminal work of Jean-Georges Noverre, \"Lettres sur la danse et les ballets\" (1760), which focused on developing the ballet d'action, in which the movements of the dancers are designed to express character and assist in the narrative. Noverre believed that: ballet should be technical but also move the audience emotionally, plots need to be unified, the scenery and music need to support the plot and be unified within the story, and that pantomime needs to be simple and understandable.\n\nReforms were made in ballet composition by composers such as Christoph Willibald Gluck. Finally, ballet was divided into three formal techniques \"sérieux\", \"demi-caractère\" and \"comique\". Ballet also began to be featured in operas as interludes called divertissements.\n\nVenice continued to be a centre of dance in Europe, particularly during the Venice Carnival, when dancers and visitors from across the continent would travel to the city for a lively cultural exchange. The city's Teatro San Benedetto became a famous landmark largely due to the ballets performed there. Italian ballet techniques remained the dominant influence in much of southern and eastern Europe until Russian techniques supplanted them in the early 20th century.\n\nBallet performances spread to Eastern Europe during the 18th century, into areas such as Hungary, where they were held in private theatres at aristocratic castles. Professional companies were established that performed throughout Hungary and also toured abroad. The Budapest National Theatre increasingly serving a role as a home for the dancers.\n\nSome of the leading dancers of the time who performed throughout Europe were Louis Dupré, Charles Le Picque with Anna Binetti, Gaetano Vestris, and Jean-Georges Noverre.\n\nThe ballerina became the most popular dance performer in Europe in the first half of the 19th century, gradually turning the spotlight away from the male dancer. In many performances, ballet heroes were played by a woman, like the Principal Boy in pantomime.\n\nThe professionalism of ballet companies became a focus for a new generation of ballet masters and dancers. Vienna was an important source of influential ballet coaches. The first ballet master of Hungary's National Theatre and Royal Opera was the Vienna-born Frigyes Campilli, who worked in Budapest for 40 years.\nThe 19th century was a period of great social change, which was reflected in ballet by a shift away from the aristocratic sensibilities that had dominated earlier periods through romantic ballet. Ballerinas such as Geneviève Gosselin, Marie Taglioni and Fanny Elssler experimented with new techniques such as pointework that gave the ballerina prominence as the ideal stage figure. Taglioni was known as the \"Christian Dancer,\" as her image was light and pure (associated with her role as the sylph in La Sylphide). She was trained primarily by her father, Filipo Taglioni. In 1834, Fanny Elssler arrived at the Paris Opera and became known as the \"Pagan Dancer,\" because of the fiery qualities of the \"Cachucha\" dance that made her famous. Professional librettists began crafting the stories in ballets. Teachers like Carlo Blasis codified ballet technique in the basic form that is still used today. The ballet boxed toe shoe was invented to support pointe work.\n\nThe Romantic movement in art, literature, and theatre was a reaction against formal constraints and the mechanics of industrialization.[22] The zeitgeist led choreographers to compose romantic ballets that appeared light, airy and free that would act as a contrast to the spread of reductionist science through many aspects of daily life that had, in the words of Poe, \"driven the hamadryad from the woods\". These \"unreal\" ballets portrayed women as fragile unearthly beings, ethereal creatures who could be lifted effortlessly and almost seemed to float in the air. Ballerinas began to wear costumes with pastel, flowing skirts that bared the shins. The stories revolved around uncanny, folkloric spirits. An example of one such romantic ballet is \"La Sylphide\", one of the oldest romantic ballets still performed today.\n\nOne strain of the Romantic movement was a new exploration of folklore and traditional ethnic culture. This influence was seen in the emergence of European folk dance and western portrayals of African, Asian, and Middle East peoples on European stages. In ballets from this period, non-European characters were often created as villains or as silly divertisements to fit the orientalist western understanding of the world. The National Opera of Ukraine, a performing arts theatre with a resident opera company, was established in Kiev in 1867. It also included a small resident troupe of ballet dancers, who would perform mainly folk-style dancing during opera productions. By 1893, this grew to a troupe large enough to stage large ballets. Folk dancing and ballets with Ukrainian stories were among the early productions.\n\nMany leading European professional ballet companies that survive today were established at new theatres in Europe's capital cities during the mid- to late- 19th century, including the Kiev Ballet, the Hungarian National Ballet, the National Theatre Ballet (Prague) and the Vienna State Ballet (formerly the Vienna State Opera Ballet). These theatres usually combined large opera, drama and ballet companies under the same roof. Composers, dramatists, and choreographers were then able to create works that took advantage of the ability to collaborate among these performance troupes.\n\nWhile France was instrumental in early ballet, other countries and cultures soon adopted the art form, most notably Russia. Russia has a recognized tradition of ballet, and Russian ballet has had great importance in its country throughout history. \nAfter 1850, ballet began to wane in Paris, but it flourished in Denmark and Russia thanks to masters such as August Bournonville, Jules Perrot, Arthur Saint-Léon, Enrico Cecchetti and Marius Petipa. In the late nineteenth century, orientalism was in vogue. Colonialism brought awareness of Asian and African cultures, but distorted with disinformation and fantasy. The East was often perceived as a faraway place where anything was possible, provided it was lavish, exotic and decadent. \nPetipa appealed to popular taste with \"The Pharaoh's Daughter\" (1862), and later \"The Talisman\" (1889), and \"La Bayadère\" (1877). Petipa is best remembered for his collaborations with Tchaikovsky. He used his music for his choreography of \"The Nutcracker\" (1892, though this is open to some debate among historians), \"The Sleeping Beauty\" (1890), and the definitive revival of \"Swan Lake\" (1895, with Lev Ivanov). These works were all drawn from European folklore.\n\nThe female dancers' classical tutu as it is recognized today began to appear at this time. It consisted of a short, stiff skirt supported by layers of crinoline or tulle that revealed the acrobatic legwork, combined with a wide gusset that served to preserve modesty.\n\nBallet companies from Europe began lucrative tours of theatres in North, Central and South America during the mid-19th century. The prestigious Colon Theater in Buenos Aires, Argentina had hosted foreign ballet artists on its stage, with touring companies from Europe presenting full ballets as early as 1867. By the 1880s, the Colon Theater had its own professional ballet company. It would still be several decades before most countries outside of Europe could claim their own professional ballet companies, however.\n\nSergei Diaghilev brought ballet full-circle back to Paris when he opened his company, Ballets Russes. It was made up of dancers from the Russian exile community in Paris after the Revolution.\n\nDiaghilev and composer Igor Stravinsky merged their talents to bring Russian folklore to life in \"The Firebird\" and \"Petrushka\" choreographed by Fokine. Diaghilev's next choreographic commissions went to Nijinsky. His First ballet was \"L'apres-midi d'un Faune\" (Afternoon of a Faun) to music by Debussy. It was notable for its two dimensional shapes and lack of ballet technique. It caused controversy by depicting the faun rubbing the scarf of one of the maidens on himself, in simulated masturbation. The most controversial work of the Ballets Russes however, was \"The Rite of Spring\", choreographed by Nijinsky with music by Stravinsky. The ballet's modern music, pigeon toed stomping and theme of human sacrifice shocked audiences so much they rioted.\n\nAfter the “golden age” of Petipa, Michel Fokine began his career in St. Petersburg but moved to Paris and worked with Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes.\nRussian ballet continued development under Soviet rule. There was little talent left in the country after the Revolution, but it was enough to seed a new generation. After stagnation in the 1920s, by the mid-1930s that new generation of dancers and choreographers appeared on the scene. The technical perfection and precision of dance was promoted (and demanded) by Agrippina Vaganova, who had been taught by Petipa and Cecchetti and headed the Vaganova Ballet Academy, the school to prepare dancers for the Kirov Ballet in St. Petersburg/Leningrad.\n\nBallet was popular with the public. Both the Moscow-based Bolshoi and the St. Petersburg (then Leningrad)-based Kirov ballet companies were active. Ideological pressure forced the creation of many socialist realist pieces, most of which made little impression on the public and were removed from the repertoire of both companies later.\n\nSome pieces of that era, however, were remarkable. The \"Romeo and Juliet\" by Prokofiev and Lavrovsky is a masterpiece. The \"Flames of Paris\", while it shows all the faults of socialist realist art, pioneered the active use of the corps de ballet in the performance and required stunning virtuosity. The ballet version of the Pushkin poem, \"The Fountain of Bakhchisarai\" with music from Boris Asafiev and choreography by Rostislav Zakharov was also a hit.\n\nThe well-known ballet \"Cinderella\", for which Prokofiev provided the music, is also the product of the Soviet ballet. During the Soviet era, these pieces were mostly unknown outside the Soviet Union and later outside of the Eastern Bloc. However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union they received more recognition.\n\nThe 1999 North American premiere of \"The Fountain of Bakhchisarai\" by the Kirov Ballet in New York was an outstanding success, for example. The Soviet era of the Russian Ballet put a lot of emphasis on technique, virtuosity and strength. It demanded strength usually above the norm of contemporary Western dancers. When watching restored old footage, one can only marvel at the talent of their prima ballerinas such as Galina Ulanova, Natalya Dudinskaya and Maya Plisetskaya and choreographers such as Pyotr Gusev.\n\nRussian companies, particularly after World War II engaged in multiple tours all over the world that revitalized ballet in the West.\n\n\"Maiden Tower\" written by Afrasiyab Badalbeyli is the first ballet in the Muslim East.\n\nFollowing the move of the Ballets Russes to France, ballet began to have a broader influence, particularly in the United States of America.\n\nFrom Paris, after disagreements with Diaghilev, Fokine went to Sweden and then the USA and settled in New York. Diaghilev believed that traditional ballet offered little more than prettiness and athletic display. For Fokine that was not enough. In addition to technical virtuosity he demanded drama, expression and historical authenticity. The choreographer must research the period and cultural context of the setting and reject the traditional tutu in favour of accurate period costuming.\n\nFokine choreographed \"Sheherazade\" and \"Cleopatra\". He also reworked \"Petrouchka\" and \"The Firebird\". One of his most famous works was \"The Dying Swan\", performed by Anna Pavlova. Beyond her talents as a ballerina, Pavlova had the theatrical gifts to fulfill Fokine's vision of ballet as drama. Legend has it that Pavlova identified so much with the swan role that she requested her swan costume from her deathbed.\n\nGeorge Balanchine developed state-of-the-art technique in America by opening a school in Chicago and more importantly, in New York. He adapted ballet to the new media, movies and television. A prolific worker, Balanchine rechoreographed classics such as \"Swan Lake\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\" as well as creating new ballets. He produced original interpretations of the dramas of William Shakespeare such as \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", and also of Franz Léhar's \"The Merry Widow\".\n\nIn 1967, Balanchine's \"Jewels\" broke with the narrative tradition and dramatized a theme rather than a plot. This focus fits with the state-sponsored funding sources in the United States which sought to encourage \"liberty and freethinking\" in contrast to narrative-driven dance, which was seen as to be connected too closely with socialism, especially Soviet communism. Today, partly thanks to Balanchine, ballet is one of the most well-preserved dances in the world.\n\nBarbara Karinska was a Russian emigree and a skilled seamstress who collaborated with Balanchine to elevate the art of costume design from a secondary role to an integral part of a ballet performance. She introduced the bias cut and a simplified classic tutu that allowed the dancer more freedom of movement. With meticulous attention to detail, she decorated her tutus with beadwork, embroidery, crochet and appliqué.\n\nGeorge Balanchine is often considered to have been the first pioneer of what is now known as neoclassical ballet, a style of dance between classical ballet and today's contemporary ballet. Tim Scholl, author of \"From Petipa to Balanchine\", considers Balanchine's \"Apollo\" (1928) to be the first neoclassical ballet. It represented a return to form in response to Serge Diaghilev's abstract ballets. \"Apollo\" and other works are still performed today, predominantly by the New York City Ballet. However, other companies are able to pay a fee for performance rights to George Balanchine's works.\n\nFrederick Ashton is another prominent choreographer associated with the neoclassical style. Three of his works have become standard pieces in the international repertoire: \"Sylvia\" (1952), \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1956), and \"Ondine\" (1958), the last of which was created as a vehicle to showcase Margot Fonteyn.\n\nOne dancer who trained with Balanchine and absorbed much of this neo-classical style was Mikhail Baryshnikov. Following Baryshnikov's appointment as artistic director of American Ballet Theatre in 1980, he worked with various modern choreographers, most notably Twyla Tharp. Tharp choreographed \"Push Comes To Shove\" for ABT and Baryshnikov in 1976; in 1986 she created \"In The Upper Room\" for her own company. Both these pieces were considered innovative for their use of distinctly modern movements melded with the use of pointe shoes and classically trained dancers—for their use of contemporary ballet.\n\nTharp also worked with the Joffrey Ballet company, founded in 1957 by Robert Joffrey. She choreographed \"Deuce Coupe\" for them in 1973, using pop music and a blend of modern and ballet techniques. The Joffrey Ballet continued to perform numerous contemporary pieces, many choreographed by co-founder Gerald Arpino.\n\nToday there are many contemporary ballet companies and choreographers. These include Madrid Ballet; Royal Ballet of Flanders; Alonzo King and his company, Alonzo King LINES Ballet; Nacho Duato and Compañia Nacional de Danza; William Forsythe, who has worked extensively with the Frankfurt Ballet and today runs The Forsythe Company; and Jiří Kylián, formerly the artistic director of the Nederlands Dans Theater. Traditionally \"classical\" companies, such as the Kirov Ballet and the Paris Opera Ballet, also regularly perform contemporary works.\n\nSeveral well-known ballet methods are named after their originators. For example, two prevailing systems from Russia are known as the Vaganova method after Agrippina Vaganova, and the Legat Method, after Nikolai Legat. The Cecchetti method was invented by Italian dancer Enrico Cecchetti (1850–1928), and the Bournonville method, which was invented by August Bournonville (1805–1879), is employed chiefly in Bournonville's own country of Denmark.\n\n\n"}

The term was used in Stove's book \"The Plato Cult\" as part of his argument against Karl Popper and other philosophers whom he characterised as \"modernists\". For Stove, Popper was influenced by the pervasive anti-Victorian mentality of the era, epitomised by Evelyn Waugh's book \"A Handful of Dust\", in which the absurdity of Victorian values is expressed by a parody of \"Victorian\" conceptions of the civilizing mission of imperialism, when the hero is finally trapped in the Amazonian jungle, forced eternally to read the works of Dickens to a tribal chief.\n\nFor Stove, the ascription of absurdity to Victorian culture was essentially a matter of taste, but one so powerful and irrational that it possessed the intensity of religious faith. As a result, it produced a revulsion – rather than a reasoned scepticism – to writers such as the Victorian philosopher of science William Whewell.\n\nFollowing Stove's usage, the term was taken up by the design historian Shelagh Wilson to refer to modernist distaste for Victorian architecture and design. Wilson argued that \"Palissyite\" design, influenced by the methods of Bernard Palissy, had been ridiculed and misunderstood by proponents of \"Puginite\" design, following the proto-modernist principles of Augustus Pugin. Wilson's argument formed part of a reaffirmation of the aesthetic principles of the grotesque.\n\nThe argument that distaste for Victorian cultural values ('Anti-victorianism') is irrational has been adopted by other writers,either following Stove's politically conservative attack on liberal thought, or Wilson's critique of modernism.\n\n\n\nVictorian Era\n"}

In modern usage, a house party is typically associated with teenage or young adult crowds, loud music, dancing, and the consumption of alcohol or other recreational drugs. Historically, the term has also referred to more genteel gatherings at country estates, lasting anywhere from several days to weeks.\n\nA house party might be organized several months, down to just a few hours, in advance. News of a party is often spread by word of mouth, the sending of formal invitations, or on social networking websites like Facebook. In the case of the latter, the host must be particularly careful of how public the information regarding the party is made. There have been cases where hundreds of people have turned up to a party they found out about on the internet without knowing the host personally, causing massive damage to the house or the items within it. In the United Kingdom, such an occurrence may be referred to as a 'Skins' party, named after a well-known TV show set in the English city of Bristol focusing on the lives of teenagers who often participate in and host such parties.\n\nA person who attends a house party, but has not been invited, is typically referred to as a \"gatecrasher\". Such an activity is usually perceived negatively, although more liberal hosts may permit gatecrashers, depending on their behaviour. \n\nIn some instances house parties do not attract large crowds, and with ten or fewer people are often referred to as a 'gathering'.\n\nAn early example of a house party can be seen in the play \"Mostellaria\" (\"The Haunted House\") by the Roman playwright Plautus. In it a young man called Philolaches is having a great time while his father is away on business.\n\nHouse parties have become a prominent feature in popular movies, particularly movies aimed at teenagers.

{"id": "17726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17726", "title": "Library of Alexandria", "text": "Library of Alexandria\n\nThe Great Library of Alexandria in Alexandria, Egypt, was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world. The Library was part of a larger research institution called the Mouseion, which was dedicated to the Muses, the nine goddesses of the arts. The idea of a universal library in Alexandria may have been proposed by Demetrius of Phalerum, an exiled Athenian statesman living in Alexandria, to Ptolemy I Soter, who may have established plans for the Library, but the Library itself was probably not built until the reign of his son Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The Library quickly acquired a large number of papyrus scrolls, due largely to the Ptolemaic kings' aggressive and well-funded policies for procuring texts. It is unknown precisely how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.\n\nAlexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning, in part because of the Great Library. Many important and influential scholars worked at the Library during the third and second centuries BC, including, among many others: Zenodotus of Ephesus, who worked towards standardizing the texts of the Homeric poems; Callimachus, who wrote the \"Pinakes\", sometimes considered to be the world's first library catalogue; Apollonius of Rhodes, who composed the epic poem the \"Argonautica\"; Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who calculated the circumference of the earth within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy; Aristophanes of Byzantium, who invented the system of Greek diacritics and was the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and Aristarchus of Samothrace, who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive commentaries on them. During the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes, a daughter library was established in the Serapeum, a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god Serapis.\n\nDespite the widespread modern belief that the Library was \"burned\" once and cataclysmically destroyed, the Library actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries, starting with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC during the reign of Ptolemy VIII Physcon, which resulted in Aristarchus of Samothrace, the head librarian, resigning from his position and exiling himself to Cyprus. Many other scholars, including Dionysius Thrax and Apollodorus of Athens, fled to other cities, where they continued teaching and conducting scholarship. The Library, or part of its collection, was accidentally burned by Julius Caesar during his civil war in 48 BC, but it is unclear how much was actually destroyed and it seems to have either survived or been rebuilt shortly thereafter; the geographer Strabo mentions having visited the Mouseion in around 20 BC and the prodigious scholarly output of Didymus Chalcenterus in Alexandria from this period indicates that he had access to at least some of the Library's resources.\n\nThe Library dwindled during the Roman Period, due to lack of funding and support. Its membership appears to have ceased by the 260s AD. Between 270–275 AD, the city of Alexandria saw a rebellion and an imperial counterattack that probably destroyed whatever remained of the Library, if it still existed at that time. The daughter library of the Serapeum may have survived after the main Library's destruction. The Serapeum was vandalized and demolished in 391 AD under a decree issued by Coptic Christian Pope Theophilus of Alexandria, but it does not seem to have housed books at the time and was mainly used as a gathering place for Neoplatonist philosophers following the teachings of Iamblichus.\n\nThe Library of Alexandria was not the first library of its kind. A long tradition of libraries existed in both Greece and in the ancient Near East. The earliest recorded archive of written materials comes from the ancient Sumerian city-state of Uruk in around 3400 BC, when writing had only just begun to develop. Scholarly curation of literary texts began in around 2500 BC. The later kingdoms and empires of the ancient Near East had long traditions of book collecting. The ancient Hittites and Assyrians had massive archives containing records written in many different languages. The most famous library of the ancient Near East was the Library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh, founded in the seventh century BC by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (ruled 668– 627 BC). A large library also existed in Babylon during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II ( 605– 562 BC). In Greece, the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos was said to have founded the first major public library in the sixth century BC. It was out of this mixed heritage of both Greek and Near Eastern book collections that the idea for the Library of Alexandria was born.\n\nThe Macedonian kings who succeeded Alexander the Great as rulers of the Near East wanted to promote Hellenistic culture and learning throughout the known world. Historian Roy MacLeod calls this \"a programme of cultural imperialism\". These rulers therefore had a vested interest to collect and compile information from both the Greeks and from the far more ancient kingdoms of the Near East. Libraries enhanced a city's prestige, attracted scholars, and provided practical assistance in matters of ruling and governing the kingdom. Eventually, for these reasons, every major Hellenistic urban center would have a royal library. The Library of Alexandria, however, was unprecedented due to the scope and scale of the Ptolemies' ambitions; unlike their predecessors and contemporaries, the Ptolemies wanted to produce a repository of all knowledge.\n\nThe Library was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world, but details about it are a mixture of history and legend. The earliest known surviving source of information on the founding of the Library of Alexandria is the pseudepigraphic \"Letter of Aristeas\", which was composed between 180 and 145 BC. The \"Letter of Aristeas\" claims that the Library was founded during the reign of Ptolemy I Soter ( 323– 283 BC) and that it was initially organized by Demetrius of Phalerum, a student of Aristotle who had been exiled from Athens and taken refuge in Alexandria within the Ptolemaic court. Nonetheless, the \"Letter of Aristeas\" is very late and it contains information that is now known to be inaccurate. Other sources claim that the Library was instead created under the reign of Ptolemy I's son Ptolemy II Philadelphus (283–246 BC).\n\nModern scholars agree that, while it is possible that Ptolemy I may have laid the groundwork for the Library, it probably did not come into being as a physical institution until the reign of Ptolemy II. By that time, Demetrius of Phalerum had fallen out of favor with the Ptolemaic court and could not, therefore, have had any role in establishing the Library as an institution. Stephen V. Tracy, however, argues that it is highly probable that Demetrius played an important role in collecting at least some of the earliest texts that would later become part of the Library's collection. In around 295 BC or thereabouts, Demetrius may have acquired early texts of the writings of Aristotle and Theophrastus, which he would have been uniquely positioned to do, since he was a distinguished member of the Peripatetic school.\n\nThe Library was built in the Brucheion (Royal Quarter) in the style of Aristotle's Lyceum, adjacent to (and in service of) the Mouseion (a Greek Temple or \"House of Muses\", whence the term \"museum\"). Its main purpose was to show off the wealth of Egypt, with research as a lesser goal, but its contents were used to aid the ruler of Egypt.\n\nThe exact layout of the library is not known, but ancient sources describe the Library of Alexandria as comprising a collection of scrolls, Greek columns, a walk, a room for shared dining, a reading room, meeting rooms, gardens, and lecture halls, creating a model for the modern university campus. The Library itself is known to have had an acquisitions department (possibly built near the stacks, or for utility closer to the harbor) and a cataloguing department. A hall contained shelves for the collections of papyrus scrolls known as \"bibliothekai\" (\"βιβλιοθῆκαι\"). According to popular description, an inscription above the shelves read: \"The place of the cure of the soul.\"\n\nThe Ptolemaic rulers intended the Library to be a collection of all knowledge and they worked to expand the Library's collections through an aggressive and well-funded policy of book purchasing. They dispatched royal agents with large amounts of money and ordered them to purchase and collect as many texts as they possibly could, about any subject and by any author. Older copies of texts were favored over newer ones, since it was assumed that older copies had undergone less copying and that they were therefore more likely to more closely resemble what the original author had written. This program involved trips to the book fairs of Rhodes and Athens. According to the Greek medical writer Galen, under the decree of Ptolemy II, any books found on ships that came into port were taken to the library, where they were copied by official scribes. The original texts were kept in the library, and the copies delivered to the owners. The Library particularly focused on acquiring manuscripts of the Homeric poems, which were the foundation of Greek education and revered above all other poems. The Library therefore acquired many different manuscripts of these poems, tagging each copy with a label to indicate where it had come from.\n\nIn addition to collecting works from the past, the Mouseion which housed the Library also served as home to a host of international scholars, poets, philosophers, and researchers, who, according to the first-century BC Greek geographer Strabo, were provided with a large salary, free food and lodging, and exemption from taxes. They had a large, circular dining hall with a high domed ceiling in which they ate meals communally. There were also numerous classrooms, where the scholars were expected to at least occasionally teach students. Ptolemy II Philadelphus is said to have had a keen interest in zoology, so it has been speculated that the Mouseion may have even had a zoo for exotic animals. According to classical scholar Lionel Casson, the idea was that if the scholars were completely freed from all the burdens of everyday life they would be able to devote more time to research and intellectual pursuits. Strabo called the group of scholars who lived at the Mouseion a σύνοδος (, \"community\"). As early as 283 BC, they may have numbered between thirty and fifty learned men.\n\nThe Library of Alexandria was not affiliated with any particular philosophical school and, consequently, scholars who studied there had considerable academic freedom. They were, however, subject to the authority of the king. A probably apocryphal story is told of a poet named Sotades of Maronea who wrote an obscene epigram making fun of Ptolemy II for marrying his sister Arsinoe II. Ptolemy II is said to have jailed him and, after he escaped, sealed him in a lead jar and dropped him into the sea. As a religious center, the Mouseion was directed by a priest of the Muses known as an \"epistates\", who was appointed by the king in the same manner as the priests who managed the various Egyptian temples. The Library itself was directed by a scholar who served as , as well as tutor to the king's son.\n\nThe first recorded head librarian was Zenodotus of Ephesus (lived 325– 270 BC). Zenodotus's main work was devoted to the establishment of canonical texts for the Homeric poems and the early Greek lyric poets. Most of what is known about him comes from later commentaries that mention his preferred readings of particular passages. Zenodotus is known to have written a glossary of rare and unusual words, which was organized in alphabetical order, making him the first person known to have employed alphabetical order as a method of organization. Since the collection at the Library of Alexandria seems to have been organized in alphabetical order by the first letter of the author's name from very early, Casson concludes that it is highly probable that Zenodotus was the one who organized it in this way. Zenodotus's system of alphabetization, however, only used the first letter of the word and it was not until the second century AD that anyone is known to have applied the same method of alphabetization to the remaining letters of the word.\n\nMeanwhile, the scholar and poet Callimachus compiled the \"Pinakes\", a 120-book catalogue of various authors and all their known works. The \"Pinakes\" has not survived, but enough references to it and fragments of it have survived to allow scholars to reconstruct its basic structure. The \"Pinakes\" was divided into multiple sections, each containing entries for writers of a particular genre of literature. The most basic division was between writers of poetry and prose, with each section divided into smaller subsections. Each section listed authors in alphabetical order. Each entry included the author's name, father's name, place of birth, and other brief biographical information, sometimes including nicknames by which that author was known, followed by a complete list of all that author's known works. The entries for prolific authors such as Aeschylus, Euripides, Sophocles, and Theophrastus must have been extremely long, spanning multiple columns of text. Although Callimachus did his most famous work at the Library of Alexandria, he never held the position of head librarian there. Callimachus's pupil Hermippus of Smyrna wrote biographies, Philostephanus of Cyrene studied geography, and Istros (who may have also been from Cyrene) studied Attic antiquities. In addition to the Great Library, many other smaller libraries also began to spring up all around the city of Alexandria.\n\nAfter Zenodotus either died or retired, Ptolemy II Philadelphus appointed Apollonius of Rhodes (lived 295– 215 BC), a native of Alexandria and a student of Callimachus, as the second head librarian of the Library of Alexandria. Philadelphus also appointed Apollonius of Rhodes as the tutor to his son, the future Ptolemy III Euergetes. Apollonius of Rhodes is best known as the author of the \"Argonautica\", an epic poem about the voyages of Jason and the Argonauts, which has survived to the present in its complete form. The \"Argonautica\" displays Apollonius's vast knowledge of history and literature and makes allusions to a vast array of events and texts, while simultaneously imitating the style of the Homeric poems. Some fragments of his scholarly writings have also survived, but he is generally more famous today as a poet than as a scholar.\n\nAccording to legend, during the librarianship of Apollonius, the mathematician and inventor Archimedes (lived  287 – 212 BC) came to visit the Library of Alexandria. During his time in Egypt, Archimedes is said to have observed the rise and fall of the Nile, leading him to invent the Archimedes' screw, which can be used to transport water from low-lying bodies into irrigation ditches. Archimedes later returned to Syracuse, where he continued making new inventions.\n\nAccording to two late and largely unreliable biographies, Apollonius was forced to resign from his position as head librarian and moved to the island of Rhodes (after which he takes his name) on account of the hostile reception he received in Alexandria to the first draft of his \"Argonautica\". It is more likely that Apollonius's resignation was on account of Ptolemy III Euergetes's ascension to the throne in 246 BC.\n\nThe third head librarian, Eratosthenes of Cyrene (lived 280– 194 BC), is best known today for his scientific works, but he was also a literary scholar. Eratosthenes's most important work was his treatise \"Geographika\", which was originally in three volumes. The work itself has not survived, but many fragments of it are preserved through quotation in the writings of the later geographer Strabo. Eratosthenes was the first scholar to apply mathematics to geography and map-making and, in his treatise \"Concerning the Measurement of the Earth\", he calculated the circumference of the earth and was only off by less than a few hundred kilometers. Eratosthenes also produced a map of the entire known world, which incorporated information taken from sources held in the Library, including accounts of Alexander the Great's campaigns in India and reports written by members of Ptolemaic elephant-hunting expeditions along the coast of East Africa.\n\nEratosthenes was the first person to advance geography towards becoming a scientific discipline. Eratosthenes believed that the setting of the Homeric poems was purely imaginary and argued that the purpose of poetry was \"to capture the soul\", rather than to give a historically accurate account of actual events. Strabo quotes him as having sarcastically commented, \"a man might find the places of Odysseus's wanderings if the day were to come when he would find the leatherworker who stitched the goatskin of the winds.\" Meanwhile, other scholars at the Library of Alexandria also displayed interest in scientific subjects. Bacchius of Tanagra, a contemporary of Eratosthenes, edited and commented on the medical writings of the Hippocratic Corpus. The doctors Herophilus (lived 335– 280 BC) and Erasistratus ( 304 – 250 BC) studied human anatomy, but their studies were hindered by protests against the dissection of human corpses, which was seen as immoral.\n\nAccording to Galen, around this time, Ptolemy III requested permission from the Athenians to borrow the original manuscripts of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, for which the Athenians demanded the enormous amount of fifteen talents () of a precious metal as guarantee that he would return them. Ptolemy III had expensive copies of the plays made on the highest quality papyrus and sent the Athenians the copies, keeping the original manuscripts for the library and telling the Athenians they could keep the talents. This story may also be construed erroneously to show the power of Alexandria over Athens during the Ptolemaic dynasty. This detail arises from the fact that Alexandria was a man-made bidirectional port between the mainland and the Pharos island, welcoming trade from the East and West, and soon found itself to be an international hub for trade, the leading producer of papyrus and, soon enough, books. As the Library expanded, it ran out of space to house the scrolls in its collection, so, during the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes, it opened a satellite collection in the Serapeum of Alexandria, a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god Serapis located near the royal palace.\n\nAristophanes of Byzantium (lived 257– 180 BC) became the fourth head librarian sometime around 200 BC. According to a legend recorded by the Roman writer Vitruvius, Aristophanes was one of seven judges appointed for a poetry competition hosted by Ptolemy III Euergetes. All six of the other judges favored one competitor, but Aristophanes favored the one whom the audience had liked the least. Aristophanes declared that all of the poets except for the one he had chosen had committed plagiarism and were therefore disqualified. The king demanded that he prove this, so he retrieved the texts that the authors had plagiarized from the Library, locating them by memory. On account of his impressive memory and diligence, Ptolemy III appointed him as head librarian.\n\nThe librarianship of Aristophanes of Byzantium is widely considered to have opened a more mature phase of the Library of Alexandria's history. During this phase of the Library's history, literary criticism reached its peak and came to dominate the Library's scholarly output. Aristophanes of Byzantium edited poetic texts and introduced the division of poems into separate lines on the page, since they had previously been written out just like prose. He also invented the system of Greek diacritics, wrote important works on lexicography, and introduced a series of signs for textual criticism. He wrote introductions to many plays, some of which have survived in partially rewritten forms. The fifth head librarian was an obscure individual named Apollonius, who is known by the epithet (\"the classifier of forms\"). One late lexicographical source explains this epithet as referring to the classification of poetry on the basis of musical forms.\n\nDuring the early second century BC, several scholars at the Library of Alexandria studied works on medicine. Zeuxis the Empiricist is credited with having written commentaries on the Hippocratic Corpus and he actively worked to procure medical writings for the Library's collection. A scholar named Ptolemy Epithetes wrote a treatise on wounds in the Homeric poems, a subject straddling the line between traditional philology and medicine. However, it was also during the early second century BC that the political power of Ptolemaic Egypt began to decline. After the Battle of Raphia in 217 BC, Ptolemaic power became increasingly unstable. There were uprisings among segments of the Egyptian population and, in the first half of the second century BC, connection with Upper Egypt became largely disrupted. Ptolemaic rulers also began to emphasize the Egyptian aspect of their nation over the Greek aspect. Consequently, many Greek scholars began to leave Alexandria for safer countries with more generous patronages.\n\nAristarchus of Samothrace (lived 216– 145 BC) was the sixth head librarian. He earned a reputation as the greatest of all ancient scholars and produced not only texts of classic poems and works of prose, but full \"hypomnemata\", or long, free-standing commentaries, on them. These commentaries would typically cite a passage of a classical text, explain its meaning, define any unusual words used in it, and comment on whether the words in the passage were really those used by the original author or if they were later interpolations added by scribes. He made many contributions to a variety of studies, but particularly the study of the Homeric poems, and his editorial opinions are widely quoted by ancient authors as authoritative. A portion of one of Aristarchus's commentaries on the \"Histories\" of Herodotus has survived in a papyrus fragment. In 145 BC, however, Aristarchus became caught up in a dynastic struggle in which he supported Ptolemy VII Neos Philopator as the ruler of Egypt. Ptolemy VII was murdered and succeeded by Ptolemy VIII Physcon, who immediately set about punishing all those who had supported his predecessor, forcing Aristarchus to flee Egypt and take refuge on the island of Cyprus, where he died shortly thereafter. Ptolemy VIII expelled all foreign scholars from Alexandria, forcing them to disperse across the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nPtolemy VIII Physcon's expulsion of the scholars from Alexandria brought about a shift in the history of Hellenistic scholarship. The scholars who had studied at the Library of Alexandria and their students continued to conduct research and write treatises, but most of them no longer did so in association with the Library of Alexandria. A diaspora of Alexandrian scholarship occurred, in which scholars dispersed first throughout the eastern Mediterranean and later throughout the western Mediterranean as well. Aristarchus's student Dionysius Thrax ( 170– 90 BC) established a school on the Greek island of Rhodes. Dionysius Thrax wrote the first book on Greek grammar, a succinct guide to speaking and writing clearly and effectively. This book remained the primary grammar textbook for Greek schoolboys until as late as the twelfth century AD. The Romans based their grammatical writings on it and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today. Another one of Aristarchus's pupils, Apollodorus of Athens ( 180– 110 BC), went to Alexandria's greatest rival, Pergamum, where he taught and conducted research. This diaspora prompted the historian Menecles of Barce to sarcastically comment that Alexandria had become the teacher of all Greeks and barbarians alike.\n\nMeanwhile, in Alexandria, from the middle of the second century BC onwards, Ptolemaic rule in Egypt grew less stable than it had been previously. Confronted with growing social unrest and other major political and economic problems, the later Ptolemies did not devote as much attention towards the Library and the Mouseion as their predecessors had. The status of both the Library and the head librarian diminished. Several of the later Ptolemies used the position of head librarian as a mere political plum to reward their most devoted supporters. Ptolemy VIII appointed a man named Cydas, one of his palace guards, as head librarian and Ptolemy IX Soter II (ruled 88–81 BC) is said to have given the position to a political supporter. Eventually, the position of head librarian lost so much of its former prestige that even contemporary authors ceased to take interest in recording the terms of office for individual head librarians.\n\nA shift in Greek scholarship at large occurred around the beginning of the first century BC. By this time, all major classical poetic texts had finally been standardized and extensive commentaries had already been produced on the writings of all the major literary authors of the Greek Classical Era. Consequently, there was little original work left for scholars to do with these texts. Many scholars began producing syntheses and reworkings of the commentaries of the Alexandrian scholars of previous centuries, at the expense of their own originalities. Other scholars branched out and began writing commentaries on the poetic works of postclassical authors, including Alexandrian poets such as Callimachus and Apollonius of Rhodes. Meanwhile, Alexandrian scholarship was probably introduced to Rome in the first century BC by Tyrannion of Amisus ( 100– 25 BC), a student of Dionysius Thrax.\n\nIn 48 BC, during Caesar's Civil War, Julius Caesar was besieged at Alexandria. His soldiers set fire to his own ships while trying to clear the wharves to block the fleet belonging to Cleopatra's brother Ptolemy XIV. This fire spread to the parts of the city nearest to the docks, causing considerable devastation. The first-century AD Roman playwright and Stoic philosopher Seneca the Younger quotes Livy's \"Ab Urbe Condita Libri\", which was written between 63 and 14 BC, as saying that the fire started by Caesar destroyed 40,000 scrolls from the Library of Alexandria. The Greek Middle Platonist Plutarch ( 46–120 AD) writes in his \"Life of Caesar\" that, \"[W]hen the enemy endeavored to cut off his communication by sea, he was forced to divert that danger by setting fire to his own ships, which, after burning the docks, thence spread on and destroyed the great library.\" The Roman historian Cassius Dio ( 155 – 235 AD), however, writes: \"Many places were set on fire, with the result that, along with other buildings, the dockyards and storehouses of grain and books, said to be great in number and of the finest, were burned.\" However, Florus and Lucan only mention that the flames burned the fleet itself and some \"houses near the sea\".\n\nScholars have interpreted Cassius Dio's wording to indicate that the fire did not actually destroy the entire Library itself, but rather only a warehouse located near the docks being used by the Library to house scrolls. Whatever devastation Caesar's fire may have caused, the Library was evidently not completely destroyed. The geographer Strabo ( 63 BC– 24 AD) mentions visiting the Mouseion, the larger research institution to which the Library was attached, in around 20 BC, several decades after Caesar's fire, indicating that it either survived the fire or was rebuilt soon afterwards. Nonetheless, Strabo's manner of talking about the Mouseion shows that it was nowhere near as prestigious as it had been a few centuries prior. Despite mentioning the Mouseion, Strabo does not mention the Library separately, perhaps indicating that it had been so drastically reduced in stature and significance that Strabo felt it did not warrant separate mention. It is unclear what happened to the Mouseion after Strabo's mention of it.\n\nFurthermore, Plutarch records in his \"Life of Marc Antony\" that, in the years leading up to the Battle of Actium in 33 BC, Mark Antony was rumored to have given Cleopatra all 200,000 scrolls in the Library of Pergamum. Plutarch himself notes that his source for this anecdote was sometimes unreliable and it is possible that the story may be nothing more than propaganda intended to show that Mark Antony was loyal to Cleopatra and Egypt rather than to Rome. Casson, however, argues that, even if the story was made up, it would not have been believable unless the Library still existed. Edward J. Watts argues that Mark Antony's gift may have been intended to replenish the Library's collection after the damage to it caused by Caesar's fire roughly a decade and a half prior.\n\nFurther evidence for the Library's survival after 48 BC comes from the fact that the most notable producer of composite commentaries during the late first century BC and early first century AD was a scholar who worked in Alexandria named Didymus Chalcenterus, whose epithet () means \"bronze guts\". Didymus is said to have produced somewhere between 3,500 and 4,000 books, making him the most prolific known writer in all of antiquity. He was also given the nickname (), meaning \"book-forgetter\" because it was said that even he could not remember all the books he had written. Parts of some of Didymus's commentaries have been preserved in the forms of later extracts and these remains are modern scholars' most important sources of information about the critical works of the earlier scholars at the Library of Alexandria. Lionel Casson states that Didymus's prodigious output \"would have been impossible without at least a good part of the resources of the library at his disposal.\"\n\nVery little is known about the Library of Alexandria during the time of the Roman Principate (27 BC–284 AD). The emperor Claudius (ruled 41–54 AD) is recorded to have built an addition onto the Library, but it seems that the Library of Alexandria's general fortunes followed those of the city of Alexandria itself. After Alexandria came under Roman rule, the city's status and, consequently that of its famous Library, gradually diminished. While the Mouseion still existed, membership was granted, not on the basis of scholarly achievement, but rather on the basis of distinction in government, the military, or even in athletics.\n\nThe same was evidently the case even for the position of head librarian; the only known head librarian from the Roman Period was a man named Tiberius Claudius Balbilus, who lived in the middle of the first century AD and was a politician, administrator, and military officer with no record of substantial scholarly achievements. Members of the Mouseion were no longer required to teach, conduct research, or even live in Alexandria. The Greek writer Philostratus records that the emperor Hadrian (ruled 117–138 AD) appointed the ethnographer Dionysius of Miletus and the sophist Polemon of Laodicea as members of the Mouseion, even though neither of these men are known to have ever spent any significant amount of time in Alexandria.\n\nMeanwhile, as the reputation of Alexandrian scholarship declined, the reputations of other libraries across the Mediterranean world improved, diminishing the Library of Alexandria's former status as the most prominent. Other libraries also sprang up within the city of Alexandria itself and the scrolls from the Great Library may have been used to stock some of these smaller libraries. The Caesareum and the Claudianum in Alexandria are both known to have had major libraries by the end of the first century AD. The Serapeum, originally the \"daughter library\" of the Great Library, probably expanded during this period as well, according to classical historian Edward J. Watts.\n\nBy the second century AD, the Roman Empire grew less dependent on grain from Alexandria and the city's prominence declined further. The Romans during this period also had less interest in Alexandrian scholarship and so the Library's reputation continued to decline as well. The scholars who worked and studied at the Library of Alexandria during the time of the Roman Empire were less well known than the ones who had studied there during the Ptolemaic Period. Eventually, the word \"Alexandrian\" itself came to be synonymous with the editing of texts, correction of textual errors, and writing of commentaries synthesized from those of earlier scholars—in other words, taking on connotations of pedantry, monotony, and lack of originality. Mention of both the Great Library of Alexandria and the Mouseion that housed it disappear after the middle of the third century AD. The last known references to scholars being members of the Mouseion date to the 260s. \n\nIn 272 AD, the emperor Aurelian fought to recapture the city of Alexandria from the forces of Queen Zenobia of the Palmyrene Empire. During the course of the fighting, Aurelian's forces destroyed the Broucheion quarter of the city in which the main library was located. If the Mouseion and Library still existed at this time, they were almost certainly destroyed during the attack as well. If they did survive the attack, then whatever was left of them would have been destroyed during the emperor Diocletian's siege of Alexandria in 297.\n\nScattered references indicate that, sometime in the fourth century, an institution known as the \"Mouseion\" may have been reestablished at a different location somewhere in Alexandria. Nothing, however, is known about the characteristics of this organization. It may have possessed some bibliographic resources, but whatever they may have been, they were clearly not comparable to those of its predecessor. For much of the late fourth century AD, the library of the Serapeum was probably the largest collection of books in the city of Alexandria. In the 370s and 380s, the Serapeum was still a major pilgrimage site for many pagans.\n\nIn addition to possessing the largest library in Alexandria, the Serapeum remained a fully functioning temple and it even had classrooms for philosophers to teach in. It naturally tended to attract followers of Iamblichean Neoplatonism. Most of these philosophers were primarily interested in theurgy, the study of cultic rituals and esoteric religious practices. The Neoplatonist philosopher Damascius (lived 458–after 538) records that a man named Olympus came from Cilicia to teach at the Serapeum, where he enthusiastically taught his students the rules of traditional divine worship and ancient religious practices. He enjoined his students to worship the old gods in traditional ways, and he may have even taught them theurgy.\n\nIn 391 AD, a group of Christian workmen in Alexandria uncovered the remains of an old Mithraeum. They gave some of the cult objects to the Christian bishop of Alexandria, Theophilus. Theophilus had the cult objects paraded through the streets so they could be mocked and ridiculed. The pagans of Alexandria were incensed by this act of desecration, especially the teachers of Neoplatonic philosophy and theurgy at the Serapeum. The teachers at the Serapeum took up arms and led their students and other followers in a guerilla attack on the Christian population of Alexandria, killing many of them before being forced to retreat and take refuge in the Serapeum itself.\n\nSince the Serapeum was built on top of a large hill and was surrounded by high walls, the teachers and their students were able to withstand a lengthy siege by the Christians of Alexandria and were even able to launch sorties against them on several occasions. According to Damascius, Olympus was the leader of the pagan guerilla fighters inside the Serapeum and he encouraged all the others to continue the vigilant worship of Serapis. Finally, the pagan guerilla fighters in the Serapeum were offered official amnesty from the emperor Theodosius I himself if they would agree to leave the temple. Olympus led a ceremony in which Serapis abandoned the temple and then they left, abandoning the Serapeum for the Christians to plunder. The Christians vandalized and demolished the temple to the ground, although some parts of the colonnade were still standing as late as the twelfth century. However, none of the accounts of the Serapeum's destruction mention anything about it having a library and sources written before its destruction speak of its collection of books in the past tense, indicating that it probably did not have any significant collection of scrolls in it at the time of its destruction.\n\nThe \"Suda\", a tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia, calls the mathematician Theon of Alexandria ( AD 335– 405) a \"man of the Mouseion\". According to classical historian Edward J. Watts, however, Theon was probably the head of a school called the \"Mouseion\", which was named in emulation of the Hellenistic Mouseion that had once included the Library of Alexandria, but which had little other connection to it. Theon's school was exclusive, highly prestigious, and doctrinally conservative. Neither Theon nor Hypatia seem to have had any connections to the militant Iamblichean Neoplatonists who taught in the Serapeum. Instead, Theon seems to have rejected the teachings of Iamblichus and may have taken pride in teaching a pure, Plotinian Neoplatonism. In around 400 AD, Theon's daughter Hypatia (born c. 350–370; died 415 AD) succeeded him as the head of his school. Like her father, she rejected the teachings of Iamblichus and instead embraced the original Neoplatonism formulated by Plotinus.\n\nTheophilus, the same bishop who ordered the destruction of the Serapeum, tolerated Hypatia's school and even encouraged two of her students to become bishops in territory under his authority. Hypatia was extremely popular with the people of Alexandria and exerted profound political influence. Theophilus respected Alexandria's political structures and raised no objection to the close ties Hypatia established with Roman prefects. Hypatia was later implicated in a political feud between Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, and Cyril of Alexandria, Theophilus's successor as bishop. Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril and, in March of 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christians, led by a lector named Peter. She had no successor and her school collapsed after her death.\n\nNonetheless, Hypatia was not the last pagan in Alexandria, nor was she the last Neoplatonist philosopher. Neoplatonism and paganism both survived in Alexandria and throughout the eastern Mediterranean for centuries after her death. British Egyptologist Charlotte Booth notes that a large number of new academic lecture halls were built in Alexandria at Kom el-Dikka shortly after Hypatia's death, indicating that philosophy was clearly still taught in Alexandrian schools. The late fifth-century writers Zacharias Scholasticus and Aeneas of Gaza both speak of the \"Mouseion\" as occupying some kind of a physical space. Archaeologists have identified lecture halls dating to around this time period, located near, but not on, the site of the Ptolemaic Mouseion, which may be the \"Mouseion\" to which these writers refer.\n\nIn AD 642, Alexandria was captured by the Muslim army of 'Amr ibn al-'As. Several later Arabic sources describe the library's destruction by the order of Caliph Omar. Bar-Hebraeus, writing in the thirteenth century, quotes Omar as saying to Yaḥyā al-Naḥwī: \"If those books are in agreement with the Quran, we have no need of them; and if these are opposed to the Quran, destroy them.\" Later scholars, including Father Eusèbe Renaudot in 1793, are skeptical of these stories, given the range of time that had passed before they were written down and the political motivations of the various writers.\n\nIt is not possible to determine the collection's size in any era with certainty. Papyrus scrolls constituted the collection, and although codices were used after 300 BC, the Alexandrian Library is never documented as having switched to parchment, perhaps because of its strong links to the papyrus trade. (The Library of Alexandria in fact was indirectly causal in the creation of writing on parchment — due to the library's critical need for papyrus, little was exported and thus an alternate source of copy material became essential.)\n\nA single piece of writing might occupy several scrolls, and this division into self-contained \"books\" was a major aspect of editorial work. King Ptolemy II Philadelphus (309–246 BC) is said to have set 500,000 scrolls as an objective for the library. The library's index, Callimachus's \"Pinakes\", has only survived in the form of a few fragments, and it is not possible to know with certainty how large and how diverse the collection may have been. At its height, the library was said to possess nearly half a million scrolls, and, although historians debate the precise number, the highest estimates claim 400,000 scrolls while the most conservative estimates are as low as 40,000, which is still an enormous collection that required vast storage space.\n\nAs a research institution, the library filled its stacks with new works in mathematics, astronomy, physics, natural sciences and other subjects. Its empirical standards were applied in one of the first and certainly strongest homes for serious textual criticism. As the same text often existed in several different versions, comparative textual criticism was crucial for ensuring their veracity. Once ascertained, canonical copies would then be made for scholars, royalty, and wealthy bibliophiles the world over, this commerce bringing income to the library.\n\nThe Library of Alexandria was one of the largest and most prestigious libraries of the ancient world, but it was far from the only one. By the end of the Hellenistic Period, almost every city in the Eastern Mediterranean had a public library and so did many medium-sized towns. During the Roman Period, the number of libraries only proliferated. By the fourth century AD, there were at least two dozen public libraries in the city of Rome itself alone. Although the Library of Alexandria was destroyed, in fact the centers of academic excellence had already moved to various capital cities. Furthermore, it is possible that most of the material from the Library of Alexandria actually survived, by way of the Imperial Library of Constantinople, the Academy of Gondishapur, and the House of Wisdom. This material may then have been preserved by the Reconquista, which led to the formation of European Universities and the recompilation of ancient texts from formerly scattered fragments.\n\nIn late antiquity, as the Roman Empire became Christianized, Christian libraries modeled directly on the Library of Alexandria and other great libraries of earlier pagan times began to be founded all across the Greek-speaking eastern part of the empire. Among the largest and most prominent of these libraries were the Theological Library of Caesarea Maritima, the Library of Jerusalem, and a Christian library in Alexandria. These libraries held both pagan and Christian writings side-by-side and Christian scholars applied to the Judeo-Christian scriptures the same philological techniques that the scholars of the Library of Alexandria had used for analyzing the Greek classics. Nonetheless, the study of pagan authors remained secondary to the study of the Christian scriptures until the Renaissance.\n\nIronically, the survival of ancient texts owes nothing to the great libraries of antiquity and instead owes everything to the fact that they were exhaustingly copied and recopied, at first by professional scribes during the Roman Period onto papyrus and later by monks during the Middle Ages onto parchment.\n\nThe idea of reviving the ancient Library of Alexandria in the modern era was first proposed in 1974, when Lotfy Dowidar was president of the University of Alexandria. In May 1986, Egypt requested the Executive Board of UNESCO to allow the international organization to conduct a feasibility study for the project. This marked the beginning of UNESCO and the international community's involvement in trying to bring the project to fruition. Starting in 1988, UNESCO and the UNDP worked to support the international architectural competition to design the Library. Egypt devoted four hectares of land for the building of the Library and established the National High Commission for the Library of Alexandria. Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak took a personal interest in the project, which greatly contributed to its advancement. Completed in 2002, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina now functions as a modern library and cultural center, commemorating the original Library of Alexandria. In line with the mission of the Great Library of Alexandria, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina also houses the International School of Information Science (ISIS), a school for students preparing for highly specialized post-graduate degrees, whose goal is to train professional staff for libraries in Egypt and across the Middle East.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16638592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16638592", "title": "Mantle of the expert", "text": "Mantle of the expert\n\nMantle of the Expert is an education approach that uses imaginary contexts to generate purposeful and engaging activities for learning. Within the fiction the students are cast as a team of experts working for a client on a commission. The commission is designed by the teacher to generate tasks and activities that fulfil the requirements of the client as well as create opportunities for students to study wide areas of the curriculum. For example, a class of students are cast (within the fiction) as a team of archaeologists excavating an Egyptian tomb for the Cairo Museum. To complete the commission they research ancient Egyptian history – learning about tombs, artefacts, and rituals – and in the process study history, geography, art, design and other subjects, as well as develop their skills in reading, writing, problem solving, and inquiry. Mantle of the Expert is not designed to teach the entire curriculum, all the time, but is rather an approach to be used selectively by the teacher along with a range of other methods.\n\nMantle of the Expert was developed by Dorothy Heathcote at Newcastle University in the 1970s and 80's. An internationally renowned authority on drama for learning, Heathcote's aim was to provide non-drama specialists with an approach that would support them in using drama across the curriculum. Heathcote believed drama was an underused approach outside drama studios and could be used as a powerful medium for learning across the curriculum.\n\nHeathcote said she didn't as much invent Mantle of the Expert as \"find herself doing it.\" In an interview with Sandra Hesten in 1993, Heathcote recounts working with a small group of children on a drama context about the Nativity – \"…thinking about it later I thought that's really important – they were expert kings. And then it began to dawn on me. People had to have a point of view. So when I reviewed the week I thought – the point of view of inn-keeping, the point of view of soldiers who are working for Rome, the point of view of angels, the point of view of kings. And that's when it started coming together.\"\n\nThis conversation is recorded by Hesten in her PhD thesis and is recounted by Heathcote at least two further times, once in the documentary \"Pieces of Dorothy\" and in an interview for the Mantle of the Expert website in 2009 - \"That was the start, I then started to think, what do I call it? That's when I got this crazy name. Which is extreme not crazy, just fanciful. I can't find a better name.\" Although Heathcote doesn't put a date on the 'Nativity' context in any of these interviews, it was likely to be around the mid-1970s, since soon after this time she began talking about Mantle of the Expert as a distinct approach and incorporated it into her courses at Newcastle University.\n\nWorking with her graduate students at Newcastle University, Heathcote spent much of the late 1970s and 80's researching, developing, and evaluating Mantle of the Expert across a range of settings – primary and secondary schools, special schools, borstals, and adult and child mental hospitals. Her method was to teach week long sessions, planned in advance with her students, which involved them playing different roles in the classroom. Although often involving a great deal of improvisation and discussion, Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert contexts were carefully planned and often elaborately embellished with resources, props, and costumes created by the graduate students. Essentially experimental in nature, these sessions were discussed, analysed, and evaluated by Heathcote and her students, and formed the foundations for the student's studies of the approach. In some cases these 'experiments' were documented.\n\nAfter retiring in 1987, Heathcote continued to work on Mantle of the Expert, and used the approach in various settings and in different parts of the world.\n\nIn 1995 she co-wrote, \"Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education\" with Gavin Bolton.\n\nAmong her students in the early 1980s was Luke Abbott. Abbott was a secondary school drama teacher at the time and took a year out to study with Heathcote on her graduate drama course. After completing his M.A. Abbott switched jobs and became a Local Authority advisor for Essex County Council and began working in schools – both primary and secondary – across the region.\n\nIn this new role Abbott used Mantle of the Expert with teachers in their classrooms, using Heathcote's laboratory method. His aim was to demonstrate how Mantle of the Expert worked with students in authentic classroom settings, using few props or elaborate resources. His approach was more pragmatic than Heathcote's and designed to be easier for teachers to implement.\n\nIn the early 2000s Abbott organised a series of conferences, both nationally and internationally, to promote the approach and its use as a pedagogy. With Heathcote as the keynote speaker and classroom teachers running workshops, Abbott's aim was to demystify Mantle of the Expert and turn the approach into something non-specialist drama teachers could use across the curriculum (as Heathcote had always planned). Schools such as Bealings Primary in Suffolk, Pound Lane Infants in Sussex, and Recreation Road Infants in Norwich began to use Mantle of the Expert as their main teaching approach and gained 'outstanding' grades from Ofsted, as well as excellent SATs results.\n\nSince this time, Abbott and others have continued to develop Mantle of the Expert, working to train teachers in the UK, New Zealand, USA, and Palestine. Since 2012 eight schools in different regions of England have become 'training schools' for Mantle of the Expert. And the approach is included in several university teacher training courses (including Newcastle).\n\nMantle of the Expert works by the teacher planning a fictional context where the students take on the responsibilities of an expert team. As the team, they are commissioned by a client (within the fiction) to work on a commission, which has been planned by the teacher to generate tasks and activities that involve them in studying and developing wide areas of the curriculum.\n\nFrom the beginning the students are aware that they are involved in a fiction. Mantle of the Expert is not a simulation invented by the teacher to trick them into thinking they are involved in something real.\n\nConsciously going in and coming out of the fiction is an important dimension of the Mantle of the Expert approach. Like imaginative play the participants are always aware that the fiction is something that can stop and start as and when they or the teacher decide. In this way, an activity inside the fiction can create a purpose for curriculum learning outside the fiction. The teacher can introduce the task to the students 'as if' they are the expert team, such as writing a report to the museum, and then stop the story and come out of the fiction to teach them directly the knowledge and skills they need to complete the task. Once the task is complete, the teacher can restart the story and the students can see how their work has an effect inside the fiction. It is this process of going in and coming out of the fictional context that defines Mantle of the Expert as a teaching and learning approach.\n\nThe 'mantle' in Mantle of the Expert is a metaphor.\n\nIt does not mean the students are endowed with expertise in the real world. Heathcote was clear about this. They are only experts inside the fiction, in the sense that they are taking on the powers and responsibilities of the team; they are not experts outside the fiction. Both the teacher and the students work collaboratively inside the fiction as people working for the same team. This means the teacher deliberately changes her power relationship with the students to one of equal power and authority. In this way decisions are made through discussion and distributed leadership. Outside the fiction, the teacher's authority remains unaffected.\n\nThe creation of a fictional context where the students experiment with making decisions, taking on responsibilities, and meeting challenging situations, is a kind of 'safe zone' within the classroom. Unlike the real world where children would rarely, if ever, have these experiences, in an imaginary world they can explore, discuss, and evaluate them. For Heathcote this is what she meant when she described her ideal classroom as a laboratory - \"when you enter such a lab you bring in your knowledge and training with you and take on the mantle of responsibility that goes with the character of the setting. Above all, you know that the result of what you do there matter to someone other than yourself. Such settings are cells effecting change in society.\"\n\nTim Taylor in his book, \"A Beginner's Guide to Mantle of the Expert\" identifies nine elements to the Mantle of the Expert approach. These are:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57797137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57797137", "title": "Miraitowa and Someity", "text": "Miraitowa and Someity\n\nMiraitowa (; pronounced \"mee-rah-e-toh-wa\") is the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics, and Someity (; pronounced \"soh-may-tee\") is the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Paralympics. Both events are scheduled to be held in Tokyo, Japan. The checkered design on both mascots was inspired by the Tokyo 2020 official logo, while Someity's pink design was inspired by cherry blossom flowers. Both fictional characters have various superpowers, such as teleportation.\n\nCreated by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competition process which took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, which selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision. The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for \"future\" and \"eternity\", and Someity is named after \"someiyoshino\", a type of cherry blossom. Someity's name also references the English phrase \"so mighty\". The mascots are expected to help finance the Tokyo Games through merchandising and licensing deals.\n\nIn late 2017 and early 2018, the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee held a competition to determine the design of the 2020 mascots. A total of 2,042 design submissions were accepted between 1 August and 14 August 2017. The entries were then subjected to a series of format and design examinations led by media specialists and the Organising Committee's Mascot Selection Panel to determine whether they \"would appeal to elementary school-aged children\" and whether they \"amply reflected the spirit of the Tokyo 2020 Games Vision\".\nBy mid-October 2017, this process reduced the pool to a shortlist of three sets of mascot candidates, which were unveiled on 7 December 2017. Each set included two mascots: one for the Olympic Games and the other for the Paralympic Games. Between 11 December 2017 and 22 February 2018, an election was conducted across 16,769 Japanese elementary schools to choose the winning entry, with each participating elementary school class allocated one vote. In total, 205,755 elementary school classes participated in the election.\n\nThe results were announced without names on 28 February 2018. The winning entry was candidate pair A, created by Ryo Taniguchi. The Mascot Selection Panel held a vote on a shortlist of proposed names on 28 May 2018, and names with the most votes were subjected to a trademark verification process before they became official. The names of the mascots, Miraitowa and Someity, were announced when the mascots made their formal debut at a press event on 22 July 2018.\n\nMiraitowa, the Olympic mascot, is a figure with blue-checkered patterns inspired by the Games' official logo. It is intended to embody \"both old tradition and new innovation\". The character has a \"strong sense of justice\" and is described as \"very athletic\". It has the ability to teleport anywhere instantly. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words \"mirai\" (future) and \"towa\" (eternity) combined. According to the Tokyo 2020 organizers, the name \"was chosen to promote a future full of eternal hope in the hearts of people all over the world\".\nSomeity, the Paralympic mascot, is a figure with pink-checkered patterns inspired by cherry blossom flowers and also the Games' official logo. The character is described as \"usually calm\" but can become \"very powerful when needed\". The character has the special ability to flight using a pink-checkered cape and cherry blossom-shaped antenna to \"talk to stones and the wind\" and can also move objects by looking at them. Someity is named after \"someiyoshino\", a type of cherry blossom, and it is also intended to refer to the English phrase \"so mighty\". \n\nAlthough the two mascots have conflicting personalities, they nonetheless have a strong friendship and respect for each other. According to their fictional backgrounds, Miraitowa and Someity \"live in the digital world\", and through the Internet, they can transport themselves between the digital world and the real world. According to Sadashige Aoki, an advertising theory professor at Hosei University, the mascots follow a Japanese tradition of \"creating personalized characters out of nature — mountains, rivers, animals and plants\", as well as a \"tradition of animism, a belief that every natural thing has a soul\". \n\nThe mascots were designed by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, who lives in the Fukuoka Prefecture in southern Japan. Taniguchi was persuaded by his father, who is also an illustrator, to study art at Cabrillo College in California. He has illustrated English-language textbooks for Japanese children. Taniguchi was uninvolved in the naming of the mascots, though he did attend a screening at which various naming proposals were introduced. As part of the agreement to use the mascots, Taniguchi transferred intellectual property rights to the mascots to the Olympic and Paralympic committees, and as a result, he will not receive any royalty payments from mascot-related licensing.\n\nThe mascots are expected to generate revenue to help finance the Tokyo Games. An Olympic official expected the mascots to generate $130 million () in revenue from licensing and merchandising. The organizers of Tokyo 2020 had been criticized for its budget management. According to \"Reuters\", a 2016 study found that overall expenses for the Olympics could be \"four times the initial estimate made in the bid process\". Tokyo 2020 must transfer intellectual property rights to the mascots to the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee after the Games are concluded, which would prevent Tokyo from licensing and developing the mascots after the Games are over.\n\nFrom late July to early September 2018, a \"Mascot House\" was located on the first floor of the Tokyo Midtown Hibiya building, where visitors could take photos with the mascots and purchase licensed merchandise featuring the mascots.\n\nThe public reaction to the mascot selection was \"generally positive\", according to an article published on \"Forbes\"' website in March 2018 by contributor Jake Adelstein. Adelstein described the mascots as \"cute\", though he commented that \"there was some criticism of the futuristic blue and pink characters falling clearly into traditional gender roles\". Adelstein speculated that the mascots would support the Olympics in Tokyo financially. Multiple observers compared the design of the mascots to that of the \"Pokémon\" franchise. An article by Agence France-Presse described the social media reaction to the mascot selection on as \"mixed\". Some users commented that the mascots were \"very Japanese and very cute\", while others commented that the mascots should have been \"more round\" or \"more huggable\". Other commentators said that the selected design \"appealed more to children whereas adults preferred the softer and more traditional options\".\n\nDan McQuade wrote in an article in sports news website \"Deadspin\" that it will be difficult for Miraitowa and Someity to match the popularity of Soohorang and Bandabi, the mascots of the 2018 Winter Olympics, citing statements from the BBC, which wrote that the 2020 mascots \"have a tough act to follow\", and \"The Japan Times\", which wrote in a headline that the success of Soohorang and Bandabi \"leaves Japan in a bind\". James Dator, in a blog entry published on the sports news website \"SB Nation\", wrote that there is \"nothing functionally wrong\" with the mascot design, but felt that Sanae Akimoto's pair C was a superior candidate and should have been chosen instead. Dator also argued that children should not have been the ones to make the final decision. On the other hand, Naoki Ogi, a Japanese pedagogy expert, emphasized the importance of the role of children in selecting the mascots, as opposed to adults. Japanese author Rurika Suzuki said that the mascots have a \"a very Japanese anime like quality\", describing them as \"brilliant and sporty and perfect for the Olympics\".\n\n"}

{"id": "45048311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45048311", "title": "Mushroom hat", "text": "Mushroom hat\n\nA mushroom hat (also sometimes referred to as a mushroom brim hat or dish hat) is a millinery style in which the brim of the hat tilts downwards, resembling the shape of a mushroom (or dish). It is a style that first emerged in the 1870s and 1880s, when it was usually made of straw. It became fashionable again from around 1907 to the late 1920s; these versions featured a distinctly downturned brim although the size and shape of the crown varied according to prevailing fashions.\n\nA new and exaggerated version of the mushroom hat was popularised by Christian Dior in 1947 as part of his \"New Look\" collection. This style generally had a minimal crown and a very wide brim, with some models resembling a flying saucer.\n\nThe defining characteristic of mushroom hats is their downturned brim, resembling a mushroom or toadstool. In the 1870s, designs in straw shaped like a mushroom became popular. These had a small crown trimmed with ribbons, flowers and – in the 1880s – bird decorations.\n\nIn 1907, mushroom hats in both straw and felt became popular. Such was their ubiquity that Evelyn Sharp lambasted them in an editorial in \"The Guardian\", writing: \"For about six months have we endured the sight of mushroom shapes in every kind of straw trimmed with a fringed silk scarf. I suppose there was some attraction in the mushroom hat when it was first designed, and I can still see its charms when it is very small and very flexible...worn by somebody in a motor car. But this autumnal growth of felt fungi deserves nothing but condemnation\". Her words fell on deaf ears as the popularity of mushroom shapes persisted. In 1909, a full-page advertisement in \"The Times\" describing Selfridge & Co's millinery choices detailed a mushroom brim hat decorated with ostrich feathers. In the same year, Dickins & Jones offered a: \"becoming mushroom hat...trimmed with wide Velvet Ribbon and a Large Posy of Flowers at side\". By 1915, variations on the design for younger girls included almost brimless mushroom models – similar to a cloche or bucket hat.\n\nThe mushroom hat was fashionable throughout the 1920s, with Princess Mary choosing a mushroom shape with a blue lace-covered brim for the opening day of Ascot in 1920. Five years later, the Duchess of York chose a mushroom design trimmed with vivid orange osprey feathers tucked at either side of the brim for Ascot's Ladies' Day race meeting.\n\nIt was a style that could incorporate the fashions for snug-fitting cloche-like designs or taller crowned hats. A fashion editorial of 1921 noted the value of wider-brimmed models: \"Plentiful sunshine has served to emphasize the advantages of a mushroom hat, which with its adequate protection often makes a sunshade unnecessary\". In the same year, velvet for babies were described as among the newest children's millinery. The hat design lent itself to ornate decorations with ribbon and feather trims and veils. It could also be made in a variety of materials, from straw for summer to felt or stiffened silk for winter; in 1925, Harvey Nichols offered a selection of mushroom hats for the autumn season in the latest velour fabric.\n\nA new variety of mushroom hat (also known as the dish hat) appeared at Dior's first fashion show on 12 February 1947. The hat balanced the neat jacket with nipped-in waist and full tulle-lined skirt, heralding a new lavishness in fabric and silhouette – what editor of American \"Harper's Bazaar\" Carmel Snow described at first viewing as a \"new look\".\n\nBy 1956, the fashion for new shapes meant a huge variety of options, as noted by \"The Guardian\"'s fashion correspondent Phyllis Heathcote: \"Flower-pots, sugar-loaves, mushrooms, melons, muffins – all these have inspired Paris milliners this season\". Of the mushroom look, she added: \"This may be small and snugly rounded, like the little pink 'Champignon de Paris' (Chabeau makes one of these in fine straw with a goffered frill of organdy under the brim that somehow carries the model away back to the source of its inspiration)...or it is wide and gently curving at the brim like the larger and flatter field variety. On these wider shapes go flat the airier techniques that the spring hat demands. Laizes of all kinds; fine picot straws, satin straws, gros-grain, short-pile summer velvet, raffia, coarse tulle, jersey, printed taffeta, crin, organdy, chiffon, and a great many flowers\". Other names for the variations that emerged include the mushroom cloche, a diminutive version of Dior's oversized dish.\n\nWide-brimmed mushroom hats continued to be popular throughout the 1950s and early '60s, with other designers incorporating the wide hat profile. Adaptations included Balmain's spring 1955 side-swept mushroom hat – a design in which the downward-curved brim of the hat dipped low on one side of the face and was tilted upwards on the other, forming an almost triangular profile.\n\nIn 1959, \"The Observer\" reported that mushroom hats were big news at Ascot for milliners such as Rose Vernier: \"The majority of her clients wanted big tulle mushrooms, but the younger girls asked for the youthful tailored shapes of medium size – when they were not demanding outsize Gigi bretons\".\n\nIn 1963, Balenciaga included extreme saucer-shaped versions of the design in velvet, worn with a tapered raglan-sleeved black wool crepe dress and lime yellow twill coat with pleated shoulder. By 1964, a more bucket-shaped line had re-emerged. Ricci showed a high-crowned white mushroom hat worn with a double-breasted gaberdine suit in the spring shows.\n\nThe mushroom shape has had a number of revivals in high fashion. During the mid 1980s, Frederick Fox created a much-photographed mushroom-style design for Diana, Princess of Wales – worn tilted and known as the 'flying saucer'. More recently, Stephen Jones designed oversized hats in fur – including mushroom-like designs – for the fall/winter 2012 Marc Jacobs' show at New York Fashion Week.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15150065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15150065", "title": "Names of Seoul", "text": "Names of Seoul\n\nSeoul has been known in the past by the successive names Wiryeseong (, Baekje era), Namgyeong (, Goryeo era), Hanseong (, Joseon era) or Hanyang (). During the period of Japanese invasion and colonization (1910-1945), Seoul was named to the Japanese or Gyeongseong () (in Korean). Its current name is \"Seoul\", and this name has been in use since at least 1882, at times concurrently with other names.\n\nSeoul originated from the Korean word “seo'ul” meaning \"capital city\". An etymological hypothesis presumes that the origin of the native word “seo'ul” derives from the native name \"Seorabeol\" (), which originally referred to Gyeongju, the capital of Silla, then called \"Geumseong\" ().\n\nUnlike most place names in Korea, \"Seoul\" has no corresponding hanja (Chinese characters used in the Korean language), although its name is presumed to derive from (\"Seorabeol\"), so Chinese-speaking countries for decades have referred to the city by its former name: (\"\" in Mandarin, \"Hon Sing\" in Cantonese and \"Hoe Zen\" in Shanghainese). On a 1751 map of China and Korea prepared in France, Seoul was marked as \"King-Ki-Tao, Capitale de la Coree\", using an approximation of the Chinese pronunciation of Gyeonggi Province (). The use of \"King-Ki-Tao\" to refer to Seoul was repeated again on the 1851 Tallis/Rapkin map of both Japan and Korea. For a time during the late 1940s and early 1950s, the transliterated name (), which closely resembles to the English pronunciation for Seoul, was used. \n\nThis often caused problems in translation, as in Korean, the terms \"Seoul\" and \"Hanseong\" are considered different. There exist many institutions and entities, most of them having no connections whatsoever, which use the two names. When the names of these institutions and entities are translated into Chinese, both \"Seoul\" and \"Hanseong\" were automatically translated to (). Typical examples of such errors in translation included Seoul National University versus Hansung University, which both would be translated to , as well as Seoul Science High School versus Hansung Science High School.\n\nThe problem, along with the confusion it caused for years, was solved in January 2005, when the Seoul City Government under then mayor Lee Myung Bak publicly requested that the Chinese name of the city be changed to (), written as in simplified Chinese in mainland China. The name was chosen by a select committee out of two names, the other being ().\n\nThe chosen name is a close transliteration of Seoul in Mandarin Chinese; () can also mean \"first\" or \"capital\". For a some time after the name change, Chinese-language news media have used both names interchangeably during their publications or broadcasts ( in print, [literally: Shouer, formerly Hancheng] in television and radio). Despite the adoption of () in Chinese media, the name () is still widely used by some Chinese people.\n\nFor some time, Mainland Chinese media refused to adopt the new name, claiming that Chinese people have the right to choose how they name other cities around the world (see Exonym and endonym). They relented by the end of the year.\n\nThis change was intended for Chinese speakers only, and has no effect on the Korean language name. The new name would be written and pronounced 수이 (Su-i) in Korean. Some linguists have criticized the selection of the new name, claiming that its pronunciation in Korean bears no resemblance to the native name at all, and that its intended representation of the Korean pronunciation, while effective in Mandarin, is lost in other regional dialects, such as in Cantonese, where the name is pronounced \"sau2 yi5\", or in Shanghainese, in which the new name () is pronounced \"sew2 el3\". These critics have said that the names \" or \" (the latter being the ancient name of Seoul) would have been much more effective in representing the city's Korean name.\n\n\"Gyeongseong\" is a Sino-Korean word for \"capital city\" (\"Gyeong\" () means \"capital\" and \"seong\" () means \"walled city\"). It was in occasional use to refer to Seoul throughout the Joseon dynasty, having earlier referred to the capitals of Goryeo and Silla. The term came into much wider use during the period of Japanese rule, because it is also the Korean form of , the former Japanese name used for Seoul during the colonial rule.\n\nSeoul was called Hanseong () or Hanyang () during the Joseon dynasty, but the city's main railway station, Seoul Station, opened with the name \"Gyeongseong Station\" () in 1900, which it retained until 1905. It was called Gyeongseong Station again from 1915 to 1947, when it assumed its current name.\n\n\"Gyeong\" is still used to refer to Seoul in the names of various railway lines and freeways, including:\n\n\n\n"}

NMS features over 150 CEOs and other executives, presidents, and other leaders in the emerging music business along with over 100 artist performances.\n\nIn 2012, NMS hosted the first New York Music Festival in collaboration with the New York City Mayor's Office of Media & Entertainment declaration of the city’s first New York Music Week. The festival took place in 17 venues throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn.\n\nNew Music Seminar 2015 took place June 21-23 in New York City.\n\nIn June 1980, Tom Silverman, Mark Josephson, Danny Heaps, and Scott Anderson brought 220 people together at a New York City rehearsal studio to discuss challenges in the music business. The event grew in subsequent years to act as a catalyst for change in it. The New Music Seminar added music showcases and a festival, initially called \"New York Nights\" and later, \"New Music Nights.\" These were held in various New York City clubs. At its peak, the first series of seminars attracted more than 8,000 participants from 35 countries.\n\nHaoui Montaug was panel director of the NMS at the time of his 1991 death.

The Artist Movement “conducted” by Margaret Cho featured star artists discussing how they got their break and tips on how to apply what worked for them.\n\nAfter a sold-out event in New York City on July 19–21, 2010, New Music Seminar returned to Los Angeles one day after the Grammys, with its 3-day event from February 14 through 16th, 2011, at the Sheraton Universal Hotel. The kickoff red carpet event, The After Grammy Jammy (the NMS Opening Night Party), was held at The Music Box in Hollywood on Monday night, February 14 with the “Artist on the Verge Finals”, which selects one artist who will walk away with over $50K in promotion and marketing, Tuesday, February 15 at The Roxy. The two-day, three-night conference included a symphony of five \"movements\" (focused discussions) over the course of two days, 12–18 minute Intensives (presentations) from key industry leaders, 22 mentoring sessions, daily and nightly musical performances, Summit Meetings and workshops on Rock, Hip Hop, Producers and Songwriting along with ongoing networking opportunities throughout.\n\nOn June 17–19, 2012, the New Music Seminar explored the exciting future of the music business with the SoundExchange Digital Broadcasting Summit and the BMI Creative Conclave; which took place at Webster Hall in New York City. The creative community and their label partners met the digital broadcasters, music bloggers, music technologists and all of the new music exposure and monetization players. Clear Channel CEO, Bob Pittman and Sean Parker were the keynote speakers and shared their vision for the future. Many sectors of the evolving new music business convened to discuss their perspectives for the exciting new future for the music business.\n\nIn 2013, the New Music Seminar, along with the SoundExchange Digital Broadcasting Summit, moved to the iconic New Yorker Hotel and held its opening night party at Webster Hall. 2013 marked a growth in international relationships spearheaded by the newly appointed General Manager, Peter Schwinge. Music showcases from France, Spain, and Sweden – an International Movement conducted by MIDEM, and an uptick in international sponsors and delegates enhanced the discussion throughout the global music community.\nA new addition, to the benefit of artists, was the Music Xray A&R Listening and Critique room where artists had the opportunity to have their music listened to, and critiqued by reps from Atlantic Records, Republic Records, RCA Records, Virgin Records, Label Recruit, LOCAL VIBES, Glassnote Records, Razor & Tie, Robbins Entertainment, Island Def Jam, and Columbia Records.\n\nThere was a 2015 event.\n\nSince the New Music Seminar's inception, many important music conferences worldwide have been formed, including SXSW, Winter Music Conference, In the City, CMJ and Canadian Music Week.\n"}

In the words of Eddie Chambers: \"In her work as an artist, academic, art historian, writer and curator, Archer-Straw consistently challenged the prevailing orthodoxies that treat Caribbean artists and cultural practice in geographical, racial and artistic isolation. In essence, her position was that we cannot fully understand or appreciate the practice of Caribbean artists without due consideration of broader factors such as migration, history, identity and, above all diaspora – the scattering of many black people beyond their ancestral homeland of Africa.\"\n\nPetrine Archer-Straw was born in Birmingham, England, to Jamaican parents, and raised during the 1960s in an atmosphere of \"... racial pride, and activism\". Her father arrived England in 1955 as a linotype press operator and subsequently sent for his family to join him. Archer-Straw notes that her home was a hub for the community. These were extremely formative experiences for the young Archer-Straw who also recalls how she \"would do the rounds [on Sunday] with my father, ... joining in house to house campaigning and, in the summer, attending the numerous rallies and protest marches. However, this community work eventually drew the ire of the right-wing British National Front and the family subsequently moved to Jamaica in the early 1970s, where Dr. Archer-Straw finished high school and started university.\n\nPetrine Archer-Straw earned a Theology, History, Sociology B.A. at the University of the West Indies (UWI) B.A. (1975–78) and later earned a Cultural History M.Phil (1983–87) at the same institution. She was also trained as an artist at the Jamaican School of Art (Diploma, Painting, 1979–82). She also received degrees from the Courtauld Institute at the University of London, where she earned an M.A. in Art History and PhD (Art History Modern, Negrophilia, 1994–95).\n\nPetrine Archer-Straw published numerous books and catalogues, including \"Eugene Palmer\" (October 1993, in collaboration with Jane Norrie), \"New World Imagery\" (October 1995), \"Negrophilia: Avant-Garde Paris and Black Culture in the 1920s\" (November 2000), \"Fifty Years, Fifty Artists\" (May 2001), and \"Back to Black: Art, Cinema and the Racial Imaginary\" (June 2005, in collaboration with David A. Bailey, and Richard J. Powell). Additionally, she taught at the Courtauld Institute at the University of London (lecturer, 1994–95), served as the first Head of Art History at the Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts in Jamaica (2002–05), and served as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow (2005–06) and Visiting Lecturer (from 2006) at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. She completed a two-year residency as a faculty guest in the Telluride House at Cornell. She taught the Caribbean Dialogs Live! course at TASP 2008 (Telluride Association Summer Program) with Professor Petrina Dacres.\n\nArcher-Straw's book \"Negrophilia: Avant-Garde Paris and Black Culture in the 1920s\" focused on the fashion for African artefacts, themes and emblems in Paris of the 1920s, including figures such as Josephine Baker. The book inspired a jazz album by Mike Ladd, \"Negrophilia: The Album\" (2005), on Thirsty Ear. The album's lyrics combine references to the milieu that Archer-Straw defines with references to the civil rights struggle in the US and more recent pop music; Pitchfork said: \"its best moments are stellar and exhilarating\" and scored it 7.2/10.\n\nIn addition to her academic work, Petrine Archer-Straw was a consultant for the development of the National Art Gallery of the Bahamas, and also curated numerous exhibits mainly related to Caribbean art and Jamaican art, including:\n\nPetrine Archer-Straw died unexpectedly, aged 56, on 5 December 2012 at UWI Hospital as the result of a sickle-cell crisis.\n\n"}
{"id": "1943137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943137", "title": "Progymnasmata", "text": "Progymnasmata\n\nProgymnasmata (Greek προγυμνάσματα \"fore-exercises\"; Latin \"praeexercitamina\") are a series of preliminary rhetorical exercises that began in ancient Greece and distended during the Roman Empire. These exercises were implemented by students of rhetoric, who began their schooling between ages twelve and fifteen. The purpose of these exercises was to prepare students for writing declamations after they had completed their education with the grammarians.\nThere are only four surviving handbooks of progymnasmata, attributed to Aelius Theon, Hermogenes of Tarsus, Aphthonius of Antioch, and Nicolaus the Sophist.\n\nComposition was not a primary subject taught in schools until the fifth century. In fact, the term “progymnasmata” first appeared in Chapter 28 of Rhetoric to Alexander, most likely written by Anaximenes of Lampsacus in the late fourth century. This work is preserved alongside those of Aristotle, yet he never mentions the use of preliminary exercises. But Aristotle does touch on the rhetorical forms, which became an aspect within the nature of progymnasmata. The use of preliminary rhetorical exercises is discussed briefly in some Greek and Roman dialogues, but all handbooks from that time remain lost today.\nThere are only four known surviving handbooks of progymnasmata. The earliest one is that of Theon, written some time during the first century A.D. In his introduction, Theon addresses teachers rather than students and criticizes students who skip out on these preliminary exercises.\nThe second handbook is attributed to one of the most influential rhetoricians of the second century, Hemogenes of Tarsus. But there is no preface to his work and the exercises are brief; therefore, many doubt its authenticity. But the third handbook is attributed to Aphthonius of Antioch, student of the great sophist Libanius during the second half of the fourth century. This is the most widely used and referenced handbook that became the standard on the practice of progymnasmata. His treatises were combined with rhetorical treatises of Hermogenes on stasis theory and style to create the “Hermogenic Corpus.”\nThe final handbook is attributed to Nicolaus of Myra, who taught rhetoric in Constantinople during the late fifth century.\n\nAlthough the exercises expressed in each known handbook are very similar, there are several minor variations between them. But because the work of Aphthonius is the one most widely recognized and practiced, these variations are often unrecognized. All students were asked to write out each assignment, memorize it, and then perform a class oration. The progymnasmata were taught in order, increasing in difficulty as the course advances. The courses were organized to begin with story-telling and end with making an argument. There was a focus on literature as a supplement to the course, paying close attention to models of rhetoric and literature. The progymnasmata of Aphthonius was first translated to Latin in the fifteenth century by Rudolphus Agricola.\n\nAesop's fables were popular at the time rhetoric became a common topic of study. There are three forms of fable: the rational form (where characters are men and women), the ethical form (where animals are protagonists), and a third form involving both. What all three have in common is they each have a moral, stated before the story begins or after it has concluded. In Aphthonius's handbook, the first exercise was to create a fable that followed the three forms.\n\nThis elementary assignment was to simply write a narrative (not to be confused with fable). It is assumed that this training is a result of Aristotle's theory of categories and introduces students to the four values of narrative, which is perspicuity, incisiveness, persuasiveness, and purity of language. The content of the narrative exercise in the progymnasmata is either political, historical, or based on fiction. Just as diegesis indicates the narrative plot of a film, the so-called narrative of a speech or oration moves the content forth.\n\nStudents were asked to take an action or saying of a famous person and elaborate on it. They were to develop the meanings of these actions or quotes with the framing under the headings of praise, paraphrase, cause, example of meaning, compare and contrast, testimonies, and an epilogue; anecdote is something that is frequently used in the Bible.\n\nMaxim or proverbs were first described by Aristotle, and in Aphthonius's book are divided into, protheptic, apotreptic, declarative, simple, and compound. A moral generalization was given to students about a writer, and they were asked to create something similar to an anecdote about the writer.\n\nThis exercise required the student to logically reason against something drawn from myths, narratives, or fables. The student's argument was that something was either impossible, illogical, unsuitable, and inexpedient.\n\nThe confirmation exercise is the opposite of refutation. The student was asked to reason in favor of something drawn from legends and literature.\n\nWorking out the commonplace involved attacking vice by envisioning criticism of stereotypes rather than individuals. Students do this by using contradiction, comparison, and maxim attacking the motivation of the demographic described.\n\nStudents used encomium to praise persons, things, times, places, animals, and growing things. Each praise could be engendered from the headings upbringing, deeds, skills, and sometimes was in the form of a comparison with another person, an epilogue, or a prayer.\n\nInvective opposes commonplace. It attacks a specific, named individual, usually a political or cultural figure.\n\nThe comparison exercise acts as a double encomium or a combination of an encomium of one person or thing and the invective against another.\n\nStudents used personification or ethopoeia by forming a speech ascribed to the ghost of a known person or of an imaginary or mythological character from past, present, or future times. This exercise was intended to request students to perform it with clarity, conciseness, and floridity.\n\nWhen asked to use ekphrasis to describe a person, place, thing, or time, students were obliged to produce a description that was complete. Included was detailed information about a person from head-to-toe, an action from start to finish, etc. This form is seen in many classical literature and historical writings.\n\nBecause this exercise is an introduction to argument in the philosophical schools, the use of thesis was not performed until first completing all previous exercises. Students had to come up with a thesis argument of their own nature; these questions were often ones difficult to answer.\n\nAphtonius calls this final exercise a gymnasma rather than progymnsasmata. This exercise is in the form of advocacy of a proposed law or opposition of it. The argument is first stated, a counterargument follows, and then the headings are discussed\n\nIn the past few years there has been considerable effort expended to see if the Progymnasmata could be adapted for use in elementary, middle and high school education. One of the leaders in this effort is James Selby, the author of the Classical Composition series, who has reduced the composition curriculum used by Quintilian and Cicero, to a level that can be effectively used by fourth through twelfth grade students.\n\nRhetorica and Progymnasmata is taught as a mandatory class in Sremski Karlovci, Serbia at Gymnasium of Karlovci high school, focusing on preparing students at early age for public speaking, as well as teaching classical rhetorics.\n\nThe progymnasmata is also taught at Highlands Latin School in Louisville, KY, as well as at Highlands Latin Cottage Schools (homeschooling support tutorials) around the United States.\n\n\n"}

Usually used in the context of rock and pop music, the term has been applied to other musical genres such as opera (The Three Tenors).\n\nSupergroups are sometimes formed as side projects and thus not intended to be permanent, while other times can become the primary project of the members' careers. It became popular in late 1960s rock music for members of already successful groups to record albums together, after which they normally split up. Charity supergroups, where prominent musicians perform or record together in support of a particular cause, have been common since the 1980s.\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" editor Jann Wenner credited Cream, which came together in 1966, as the first supergroup. Eric Clapton formerly of The Yardbirds and John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, along with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, ex of the Graham Bond Organization, formed the band in 1966, recorded four albums, and split up in 1968. Guitarist Clapton and drummer Baker went on to form Blind Faith, another blues rock supergroup which recruited former Spencer Davis Group and Traffic singer Steve Winwood and Family bassist Ric Grech. The group recorded one studio album before dissipating less than a year after formation.\n\nThe term may have come from the 1968 album \"Super Session\" with Al Kooper, Mike Bloomfield, and Stephen Stills.

{"id": "65015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65015", "title": "Swamp Thing", "text": "Swamp Thing\n\nSwamp Thing is a fictional character and hero in comic books published by American company DC Comics. A humanoid/plant elemental creature, created by writer Len Wein and artist Bernie Wrightson, the Swamp Thing has had several humanoid or monster incarnations in various different storylines. The character first appeared in \"House of Secrets\" #92 (July 1971) in a stand-alone horror story set in the early 20th century. The character then returned in a solo series, set in the contemporary world and in the general DC continuity. The character is a swamp monster that resembles an anthropomorphic mound of vegetable matter, and fights to protect his swamp home, the environment in general, and humanity from various supernatural or terrorist threats.\n\nThe character found perhaps its greatest popularity during the 1970s and early 1990s. Outside of an extensive comic book history, the Swamp Thing has inspired two theatrical films, a live-action television series, and a five-part animated series, among other media. IGN ranked him 28th in the \"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\" list. He appeared in his first live adaptation in the 1982 film. Dick Durock portrayed Swamp Thing while Ray Wise played Alec Holland. Durock reprised the role in the sequel film \"The Return of Swamp Thing\" along with playing Holland. Durock reprised the role again in the 1990 television series. The new Swamp Thing will be played by Derek Mears with Andy Bean playing his human form Alec Holland in the television series for the new DC streaming service.\n\nLen Wein came up with the idea for the character while riding a subway in Queens. He later recalled, \"I didn't have a title for it, so I kept referring to it as 'that swamp thing I'm working on.' And that's how it got its name!\" Bernie Wrightson designed the character's visual image, using a rough sketch by Wein as a guideline.\n\nLen Wein was the writer for the first 13 issues, before David Michelinie and Gerry Conway finished up the series. Burgeoning horror artist Bernie Wrightson drew the first 10 issues of the series while Nestor Redondo drew a further 13 issues, the last issue being drawn by Fred Carrillo. The original creative team worked closely together; Wrightson recalled that during story conferences, Wein would walk around the office acting out all the parts. The Swamp Thing fought against evil as he sought the men who murdered his wife and caused his monstrous transformation, as well as searching for a means to transform back to human form.\n\nThe Swamp Thing has since fought many villains. Though they only met twice during the first series, the mad Dr. Anton Arcane (with his obsession with gaining immortality) became the Swamp Thing's nemesis, even as the Swamp Thing developed a close bond with Arcane's niece Abigail Arcane. Arcane was aided by his nightmarish army of Un-Men and the Patchwork Man, alias Arcane's brother Gregori Arcane, who after a land mine explosion was rebuilt as a Frankenstein's Monster-type creature by his brother. Also involved in the conflict was the Swamp Thing's close friend-turned-enemy Matthew Cable, a federal agent who mistakenly believed the Swamp Thing to be responsible for the deaths of Alec and Linda Holland.\n\nAs sales figures plummeted towards the end of the series, the writers attempted to revive interest by introducing fantastical creatures, aliens, and even Alec Holland's brother, Edward (a plot point ignored by later writers), into the picture.\n\nThe last two issues saw the Swamp Thing transformed back into a human being and having to fight one last menace as an ordinary human. The series was cancelled and a blurb for an upcoming team-up with Hawkman led nowhere.\n\nIn 1982, DC Comics revived the \"Swamp Thing\" series, attempting to capitalize on the summer 1982 release of the Wes Craven film of the same name. A revival had been planned for 1978, but was a victim of the DC Implosion. The new series, called \"The Saga of the Swamp Thing\", featured an adaptation of the Craven movie in its first annual. Now written by Martin Pasko, the book loosely picked up after the Swamp Thing's appearance in \"Challengers of the Unknown\", with the character wandering around the swamps of Louisiana seen as an urban legend and feared by locals. Pasko's main arc depicted the Swamp Thing roaming the globe, trying to stop a young girl (and possible Anti-Christ) named Karen Clancy from destroying the world.\n\nWhen Pasko had to give up work on the title due to increasing television commitments, editor Len Wein assigned the title to British writer Alan Moore. When Karen Berger took over as editor, she gave Moore free rein to revamp the title and the character as he saw fit. Moore reconfigured the Swamp Thing's origin to make him a true monster as opposed to a human transformed into a monster. In his first issue, he swept aside most of the supporting cast Pasko had introduced in his year-and-a-half run as writer and brought the Sunderland Corporation to the forefront, as they hunted the Swamp Thing and \"killed\" him in a hail of bullets. The subsequent investigation revealed that the Swamp Thing was not Alec Holland transformed into a plant, but actually a wholly plant-based entity created upon the death of Alec Holland, having somehow absorbed Holland's memory and personality into himself. He is described as \"a plant that thought it was Alec Holland, a plant that was trying its level best to \"be\" Alec Holland.\" This is explained as a result of the plant matter of the swamp absorbing Holland's serum, with the Swamp Thing's appearance being the plants' attempt to duplicate Holland's human form. This revelation resulted in the Swamp Thing suffering a temporary mental breakdown and identity crisis, but he eventually reasserted himself in time to stop the latest scheme of the Floronic Man.\n\nIssue #32 was a strange twist of comedy and tragedy, as the Swamp Thing encounters Pogo, Walt Kelly's character.\n\nMoore would later reveal, in an attempt to connect the original one-off Swamp Thing story from \"House of Secrets\" to the main \"Swamp Thing\" canon, that there had been dozens, perhaps hundreds, of Swamp Things since the dawn of humanity, and that all versions of the creature were designated defenders of the Parliament of Trees, an elemental community which rules a dimension known as \"the Green\" that connects all plant life on Earth. Moore's \"Swamp Thing\" broadened the scope of the series to include ecological and spiritual concerns while retaining its horror-fantasy roots. In issue #37, Moore formally introduced the character of John Constantine as a magician/con artist who would lead the Swamp Thing on the \"American Gothic\" storyline. Alan Moore also introduced the concept of the DC characters Cain and Abel being the Biblical Cain and Abel caught in an endless cycle of murder and resurrection.\n\n\"The Saga of the Swamp Thing\" was the first mainstream comic book series to completely abandon the Comics Code Authority.\n\nWith issue #65, regular penciler Rick Veitch took over from Moore and began scripting the series, continuing the story in a roughly similar vein for 24 more issues. Veitch's term ended in 1989 in a widely publicized creative dispute, when DC refused to publish issue #88 because of the use of Jesus Christ as a character despite having previously approved the script in which the Swamp Thing is a cupbearer who offers Jesus water when he calls for it from the cross. The series was handed to Doug Wheeler, who made the cup that the Shining Knight believed to be the Holy Grail to be a cup used in a religious ceremony by a Neanderthal tribe that was about to be wiped out by Cro-Magnons, in the published version of issue #88. Beginning in issue #90, Wheeler reintroduced the Matango that Stephen Bissette had introduced in \"Swamp Thing Annual\" #4.\n\nAfter a period of high creative turnover, in 1991 DC sought to revive interest in \"Swamp Thing\" by bringing horror writer Nancy A. Collins on board to write the series. Starting with \"Swamp Thing Annual\" #6, Collins moved on to write \"Swamp Thing\" #110–138, dramatically overhauling the series by restoring the pre-Alan Moore tone and incorporating a new set of supporting cast members into the book. Collins resurrected Anton Arcane, along with the Sunderland Corporation, as foils for the Swamp Thing. Her stories tended to be ecologically based and at one point featured giant killer flowers.\n\nWith issue #140 (March 1994), the title was handed over to Grant Morrison for a four-issue arc, co-written by the then-unknown Mark Millar. As Collins had destroyed the status quo of the series, Morrison sought to shake the book up with a four-part storyline which had the Swamp Thing plunged into a nightmarish dreamworld scenario where he was split into two separate beings: Alec Holland and the Swamp Thing, which was now a mindless being of pure destruction. Millar then took over from Morrison with issue #144, and launched what was initially conceived as an ambitious 25-part storyline where the Swamp Thing would be forced to go upon a series of trials against rival elemental forces. Millar brought the series to a close with issue #171 in a finale where the Swamp Thing becomes the master of all elemental forces, including the planet.\n\nWritten by Brian K. Vaughan and drawn by Roger Petersen and Giuseppe Camuncoli in 2001, the third \"Swamp Thing\" series focused on the daughter of the Swamp Thing, Tefé Holland. Even though she was chronologically 11-12, the series had Tefé aged into the body of an 18-year-old with a mindwipe orchestrated by the Swamp Thing, Constantine and Abby in order to try to control her darker impulses, brought about by her exposure to the Parliament of Trees. Due to the circumstances under which she was conceived, while the Swamp Thing, possessing John Constantine, was not aware he was given a blood transfusion by a demon, she held power over both plants and flesh.\n\nBelieving herself to be a normal human girl named Mary who had miraculously recovered from cancer three years prior, she rediscovers her powers and identity when she finds her boyfriend and best friend betraying her on prom night. In a moment of anger, her powers manifest and she kills them both. Tefé then fakes her own death and embarks on a series of misadventures that take her across the country, and ultimately to Africa, in search of a mythical \"Tree of Knowledge\".\n\nDuring this series, it seems that the Swamp Thing and Abigail have reunited as lovers and are living in their old home in the Louisiana swamps outside Houma. The home in which they live more closely resembles the one that the Swamp Thing constructs for Abigail during the Moore run than the home in which they dwell during the Collins run. In a confrontation with Tefé, the Swamp Thing explains that he has cut himself off from the Green and there seems to be no trace of the god-like powers he acquired from the Parliaments of Air, Waves, Stone or Flames during the Millar run. Also, Vaughan's Swamp Thing does not seem to have been divorced from the humanity of his Alec Holland self. The disconnection between these two entities, however, emerges as a plot point in Volume 4.\n\nA fourth series began in 2004, with writers Andy Diggle (#1–6), Will Pfeifer (#7–8) and Joshua Dysart (#9–29). In this latest series, the Swamp Thing is reverted to his plant-based Earth Elemental status after the first storyline, and he attempts to live an \"eventless\" life in the Louisiana swamps. Tefé, likewise, is rendered powerless and mortal. Issue #29, intended to be the final issue of the fourth volume, was cancelled due to low sales numbers.\n\nThe conclusion of the series \"Brightest Day\" revealed that the Swamp Thing had become corrupted by the personality of the villain Nekron in the wake of the \"Blackest Night\" crossover. The Swamp Thing now believed himself to be Nekron, similar to how he had once believed himself to be Alec Holland. The Swamp Thing went on a rampage in Star City, ultimately seeking to destroy all life on Earth. The Entity within the White Lantern used several heroes, including Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Firestorm, the Martian Manhunter, Aquaman and Deadman to slow the rampage and to construct a new Swamp Thing based on the body of Alec Holland. Instead of merely thinking it was Holland, this version of the Swamp Thing would actually be him. The new Swamp Thing defeated and killed the corrupted and original Swamp Thing. The Swamp Thing then restored life to natural areas around the world and declared that those who hurt \"the Green\" would face his wrath. He also restored Aquaman, Firestorm, Hawkman, and the Martian Manhunter to normal. The book ended with the Swamp Thing killing several businessmen who engaged in deliberate, illegal polluting activities.\n\nThis three–issue miniseries follows immediately after the events of \"Brightest Day\", and follows the actions of John Constantine as he tries to work out what has changed with the Swamp Thing, and track him down, with the assistance of Zatanna, the Batman, and Superman.\n\nDC Comics relaunched \"Swamp Thing\" with issue #1 in September 2011 as part of The New 52.\n\nA six–issue miniseries written by Len Wein, co-creator of the Swamp Thing, with art by Kelley Jones was released between March and August 2016.\n\nAlex Olsen was a talented young scientist in Louisiana in the early 1900's married to a woman named Linda. Alex's assistant, Damian Ridge, was secretly in love with Linda and plotted the death of his friend. He tampered with Olsen's chemicals killing him in the explosion and dumped his body in the nearby swamp. Ridge used Linda's grief to convince her to marry him, only to one day become confronted with Alex Olsen again, now a risen humanoid pile of vegetable matter. Olsen killed Ridge, but Linda did not recognize him and ran away leaving Olsen to wander the swamps alone as a monster.\n\nAlbert Hollerer is a German airplane pilot who fought in World War II and was shot down over a bog in 1942. In the wake of his death in which he was burned alive, he became the Swamp Thing of that era. For years, he walked the Earth, keeping only a small airplane toy with him as the only memory of his former life. In 1954, the creature finally found peace among the Parliament of Trees.\n\nAlan Hallman was selected by the Parliament of Trees to be the planet's Earth elemental before Alec Holland became the Swamp Thing. He had been a scientist working on a formula to repair damaged crops when the Parliament chose him, and he died in flames—as all elementals must. However, while traversing the Green, he was captured within a creature of the Grey, which broke him down and converted him into fungus and mold. He was recreated as an emissary of the Grey by Matango, who gathered Hallman's consciousness back together in his Chamber of Dreams. With Matango's return from Hell, Alan Hallman was released into the Green to find and capture the Swamp Thing and his daughter Tefé and force them to surrender their individuality to the Grey.\n\nAaron Hayley is an American soldier in World War II, who was slain and arose as the Swamp Thing. Since there was already an active Plant Elemental at the time (Albert Höllerer), he was only active as Swamp Thing for a short time, and soon took his place among the Parliament of Trees.\n\nCalbraith A. H. Rodgers was born in England in 1920. Ever since he was a boy, he had heard whispers from the leaves, the flowers and the trees that something great and terrible would be waiting for him on the other side. Afraid of what would be waiting for him on the other side of death, he enlisted in the Royal Air Force to try and escape the pull of the Green. However, on May 3, 1942, on his fourth mission as a pilot during the war, his plane was shot down. Landing in a swamp, the dying Rodgers felt the branches and petals reaching for him, delivering him to his new life as the protector of the Green. By fusing the man with the Green in the final moments of his life, the Swamp Thing was created.\n\nRodgers served a number of years as the Swamp Thing before taking his place in the Parliament of Trees, the final resting place of his predecessors, where his consciousness would live on as the flesh of the body passed away. Rodgers would later leave the Parliament of Trees to become the Swamp Thing once again in order to warn Alec Holland of the coming of both the Rot and Sethe, the enemy that the Swamp Thing was born to defend the Green against. Rodgers knew that to remove his consciousness from the Parliament of Trees would mean true death. After delivering his message to Alec and warning him to stay away from Abby Arcane, he passed away.\n\nSwamp Thing can inhabit and animate vegetable matter anywhere, including alien plants, even sentient ones, and construct it into a body for himself. As a result, bodily attacks mean little to him. He can easily regrow damaged or severed body parts, and can even transport himself across the globe by leaving his current form, transferring his consciousness to a new form grown from whatever vegetable matter is present in the location he wishes to reach. He even grew himself a form out of John Constantine's meager tobacco supply on one occasion.\n\nSwamp Thing is normally human-sized or slightly larger than average, but he can grow bodies much larger. He once used Sequoioideae to grow a body the size of an office block.\n\nSwamp Thing possesses superhuman strength. While Swamp Thing's strength has never been portrayed as prominently as many of his other abilities, he is arguably one the most powerful beings in the DCU. DC's New 52 continuity made several changes, though mostly highlighting previous abilities and a physical look not dissimilar from previous incarnations. New 52 continuity did however bring Swamp thing further into the shared universe continuity by placing him permanently in the Justice League Dark team lineup. Partnering with many familiar faces like John Constantine, Zatanna Zatara, and Deadman. Swamp Thing's powers and abilities make him the true powerhouse of the team. His power limits have yet to be established. He has demonstrated sufficient strength to rip large trees out of the ground with ease and trade blows with the likes of Etrigan the Demon.\n\nSwamp Thing can control any form of plant life. He can make it bend to his will or accelerate its growth. This control even extends to alien life, as he once cured Superman of an infection caused by exposure to a Kryptonian plant that was driving Superman mad and causing his body to burn out its own power.\n\nAfter the run of Mark Millar, Swamp Thing had also mastered the elements of Fire, Earth, Water and Air, the Parliaments of each were later killed by The Word, implying that he has retained these abilities and has the power once held by the Parliaments. This has yet to be explained.\n\nThe new Swamp Thing (a resurrected Alec Holland) has no power over a White Lantern Power Ring but he can control all forms of plant life and even grow every kind even if it is unknown to him. He can also grow from any plant life anywhere, dead or alive. This is seen when Seeder creates a portal to the moon and banishes him there. However, Holland simply resurrects himself back on Earth from the plants growing on Seeder's face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, the \"Swamp Thing\" series has been nominated for and won several awards. Len Wein won the 1972 Shazam Award for \"Best Writer (Dramatic Division)\" and Berni Wrightson won the Shazam Award for \"Best Penciller (Dramatic Division)\" that same year for their work on \"Swamp Thing\". Wein and Wrightson also won the Shazam Award for \"Best Individual Story (Dramatic)\" in 1972 for \"Dark Genesis\" in \"Swamp Thing\" #1. The series won the Shazam Award for \"Best Continuing Feature\" in 1973.\n\nAlan Moore won the 1985 and 1986 Jack Kirby Awards for \"Best Writer\" for \"Swamp Thing\". Moore, John Totleben, and Steve Bissette won the 1985 Jack Kirby Award for \"Best Single Issue\" for \"Swamp Thing Annual\" #2. They also won the 1985, 1986, and 1987 Jack Kirby Awards for \"Best Continuing Series\" for \"Swamp Thing\".\n\n"}

The Tata Duende is considered a powerful spirit that protects animals and the jungle. There are many stories that have been passed on from generation to generation, to warn against this mischievous spirit. This creature has appeared on a postage stamp of Belize as part of a series on Belizean folklore.The name Tata Duende comes from the Mayan word \"Tata\" meaning Grandfather or old and the word \"Duende\" is Spanish for goblin. In Yucatec Maya the Tata Duende is known as Nukux Tat.\n\nThe Tata Duende is a famous folklore common to the Mayan culture and the Mestizo culture. According to different stories, this \"grandfather demon\" is well known for luring children into the jungle, therefore, the Tata Duende has been used to scare children into behaving. Farmers would blame the Tata Duende if weird things happened on the farm. For example: it was common to see a horse's mane braided and it is claimed that these braids would be difficult to loose, sometimes it had to be cut. The true origin of the 'Tata Duende' seems to be quite unclear since many countries may have similar descriptions but different names. However, the term 'Tata Duende' seems to be coined in the Belizean folklore.\n\nPeople who claimed to have seen the 'Tata Duende' said he was about 3 feet tall and wore a wide brimmed hat. Sometimes he wore a red hat and animal skin for clothing. He is also described as having his feet pointing backwards and his thumbs missing. Parents would tell their children that if they ever came across this creature to hide their thumbs or the Duende would bite it off. Some stories of people who have encountered the 'Tata Duende' say that they could recognize him because of his distinct whistle. Others say that he smokes cigars and plays the guitar. \n\nThe creature was investigated on a 5th season episode of \"Destination Truth\", where it was speculated that Tata Duende sightings might actually be of the indigenous spider monkey.\n\nThere are many stories warning people to be cautious at farms or jungle when walking alone. The Duende has a special interest in children where he would lure them deeper in the woods and the only way to escape him would be if you hide your thumbs and show only your four fingers. The Duende would think you are like him and would let you go. Other stories say that the Duende would appear mostly during the 'Lenten Season' especially on 'Good Friday.' He is also known for braiding horses' manes and little girls' hair. In addition, the 'Tata Duende' is known to often change into a small animal, or even someone you know.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "226519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226519", "title": "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad", "text": "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\n\nThe 7th Voyage of Sinbad is a 1958 Technicolor heroic fantasy adventure film from Columbia Pictures, produced by Charles H. Schneer, directed by Nathan H. Juran, that stars Kerwin Mathews, Torin Thatcher, Kathryn Grant, Richard Eyer, and Alec Mango. \n\nThis was the first of three Sinbad feature films from Columbia, the much later two being \"The Golden Voyage of Sinbad\" (1973) and \"Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger\" (1977). All three Sinbad films were conceptualized by Ray Harryhausen who used a full color widescreen stop-motion animation technique he created called Dynamation.\n\nWhile similarly named, the film does not follow the storyline of the tale \"The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor\" but instead has more in common with the Third and Fifth voyages of Sinbad.\n\n\"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\" was selected in 2008 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nSinbad the Sailor (Kerwin Mathews) and his crew land their ship on the island of Colossa, where they encounter Sokurah the magician (Torin Thatcher) fleeing from a giant cyclops. Though he escapes, Sokurah loses a magic lamp to the creature. Sinbad refuses his desperate pleas to return to the island because Parisa, Princess of Chandra (Kathryn Grant), is aboard. Sinbad has fallen in love with her, and their coming marriage is meant to secure peace between her father's realm and Sinbad's homeland, Baghdad.\n\nAfter reaching Baghdad, Sokurah performs magic at the pre-wedding festivities, temporarily turning Parisa's handmaiden into a serpent-like being. Despite his prowess and a dark prophecy about war between Baghdad and Chandra, the Caliph of Baghdad (Alec Mango) refuses to help the magician return to Colossa. Later that night, Sokurah secretly shrinks the princess, enraging her father, the Sultan of Chandra (Harold Kasket), who declares war on Baghdad. Sinbad and the Caliph give in to Sokurah, who explains that the eggshell of a Roc is needed for the potion to restore Parisa, and it can be found only on Colossa. Sokurah provides Sinbad with the plans for a giant crossbow for protection against the island's giant creatures.\n\nSinbad recruits additional crewmen from among the convicts in the Caliph's prisons. Before they reach Colossa, the cutthroats mutiny and capture Sokurah, Sinbad, and his men. During a violent storm, the sounds of keening demons from an island south of Colossa drives the crew nearly mad, endangering the ship. One of the men releases Sinbad so he can save the ship, while the mutineers' leader falls to his death from the crow's nest.\n\nOn Colossa, Sinbad, Sokurah, and six others enter the valley of the cyclops, followed by Sinbad's loyal aide Harufa (Alfred Brown). Sinbad and Sokurah split their forces. Sinbad and his men find the cyclops' treasure cave, but are captured by one of the creatures and locked in a wooden cage. In the meantime, Sokurah retrieves the magic lamp, but is chased by the cyclops, who kills three of the men. With Parisa's aid, Sinbad manages to escape, then blinds the one-eyed creature and lures it off the edge of a cliff to its death. Sinbad decides to keep the lamp until Parisa is returned to normal size.\n\nSokurah leads Sinbad and his starving men to the nesting place of the giant Rocs. Sinbad's men, out of hunger, try to break open a Roc egg, causing it to hatch, but the newborn chick is killed by the men and roasted for food. While the men are eating, Parisa enters the magic lamp and befriends the childlike Genie inside, Barani (Richard Eyer), who tells her how to summon him in exchange for her promise of his freedom. The parent Roc returns and slays the remaining men. Sinbad tries to summon the genie, but he is grabbed by the Roc, who drops him unconscious into its nest. Sokurah kills Harufa and abducts the princess, taking her to his underground fortress.\n\nSinbad awakes and rubs the magic lamp, summoning Barani, who takes Sinbad to Sokurah's fortress and helps him evade the chained dragon that stands guard. Sinbad reaches Sokurah, who restores the princess to normal. When Sinbad refuses to hand over the lamp, the magician animates a skeleton warrior, which Sinbad fights and destroys. With the help of the genie, Sinbad and Parisa make their way out of the cave, stopping to destroy the lamp by throwing it into a pool of lava, thus freeing Barani.\n\nLeaving the cave, they encounter another cyclops. Sinbad releases the dragon, which fights and kills the cyclops. Sinbad and Parisa make their escape, but Sokurah orders the dragon to hunt them down. Sinbad heads to the beach, where his men have readied the giant crossbow, and they use it to kill the dragon. The dying dragon collapses on Sokurah, crushing him to death. Sinbad, Parisa, and the remaining crew depart for Baghdad. They are joined by Barani, now human, who appoints himself as Sinbad's cabin boy and, in a final act of magic, presents Sinbad and Parisa with the treasure from the cyclops' cave as a wedding gift.\n\nIt took Ray Harryhausen 11 months to complete the full color, widescreen stop-motion animation sequences for \"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\". Harryhausen's \"Dynamation\" label was used for the first time on this film.\n\nHarryhausen gave the cyclops a horn, goat legs, and cloven hooves, an idea based upon the concept of the Greek god Pan. He lifted much of the creature's design (for example the torso, chest, arms, poise and style of movement) from his concept of the Ymir (the Venusian creature from his earlier \"20 Million Miles to Earth\"). He used the same armature for both figures; to do this, he had to cannibalize the ymir, removing the latter's latex body.\n\nHarryhausen researched the cobra-woman sequence (when Sakourah entertains the Caliph and the Sultan) by watching a belly dancer in Beirut, Lebanon. During the performance, Harryhausen says, \"smoke was coming up my jacket. I thought I was on fire! It turned out the gentleman behind me was smoking a hookah!\" The cyclops is the film's most popular character, but Harryhausen's personal favorite was the cobra-woman, a combination of Princess Parisa's maid, Sadi, and a cobra.\n\nThe film's original script had a climax that involved two cyclops fighting. In the final version, however, the climactic battle featured a single cyclops versus a dragon. The model of the dragon was more than three feet long and was very difficult to animate; the fight sequence took nearly three weeks for Harryhausen to complete. Originally, it was planned to have the dragon breathing fire from its mouth during the entire sequence, but the cost was deemed too high. So the scenes where it does breathe fire, Harryhausen used a flamethrower, shooting out flames 30 to 40 feet against a night sky, then superimposeing the filmed fire very near the dragon's mouth.\n\nThe sword fight scene between Sinbad and the skeleton proved so popular with audiences that Harryhausen recreated and expanded the scene five years later, this time having a group of seven armed skeletons fight the Greek hero Jason and his men in 1963's \"Jason and the Argonauts\".\n\nThe stop-motion cobra-woman figure used for the film was cannibalized 20 years later in order to make the Medusa figure in Harryhausen's final film, \"Clash of the Titans.\"\n\nThe music score for \"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\" was composed by Bernard Herrmann, better known at the time for his collaboration with the director Alfred Hitchcock. Herrmann went on to write the scores for three other Harryhausen films: \"Mysterious Island\", \"The 3 Worlds of Gulliver\", and \"Jason and the Argonauts\". Of the four, Harryhausen regarded the score for \"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\" as being the finest, due to the empathy Herrmann's main title composition evoked for the subject matter.\n\nThe soundtrack producer Robert Townson, who re-recorded the score in 1998 with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, described the music as rich and vibrant, commenting \"I would cite \"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\" as one of the scores which most validates film music as an art form and a forum where a great composer can write a great piece of music. As pure composition, I would place Sinbad beside anything else written this century and not worry about it being able to stand on its own\".\n\n\"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\" continues to be well-reviewed by critics, with many holding the opinion that it is the best film of the \"Sinbad\" trilogy. The film carries a 100% approval rating at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with several reviewers citing its nostalgic value. Mountain Xpress critic Ken Hanke calls it \"Childhood memory stuff of the most compelling kind.\"\n\n\nProducer Edward Small, impressed with the film's success, produced a fantasy film on his own in 1962, titled \"Jack the Giant Killer\", using the principal cast members of \"The 7th Voyage\", Kerwin Mathews as Jack and Torin Thatcher as the evil sorcerer Pendragon, reuniting as the starring characters.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26429281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26429281", "title": "Tron (franchise)", "text": "Tron (franchise)\n\nTron is an American science fiction media franchise. It began in 1982 with the Walt Disney Pictures film \"Tron\". It was followed by various film tie-ins, a comic series and the 2010 sequel \"\". More sequels were planned but have now been suspended, and a premiered on Disney XD in June 2012.\n\nTRON also existed as the TRON command in the early versions of the computer programming language BASIC. TRON stood for TRace ON, which prompted the program to print or display line numbers for each command line of a program as it ran, in order to assist in the debugging of the program. In the TRON film, TRON became a character who worked in programs to defeat evil elements trying to subvert the program.\n\n\"Tron\" is a 1982 American action science fiction film by Walt Disney Pictures. It stars Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn, Bruce Boxleitner as Tron and his User Alan Bradley, Cindy Morgan as Yori and Dr. Lora Baines, and Dan Shor as Ram. David Warner plays all three main antagonists: the program Sark, his User Ed Dillinger, and the voice of the Master Control Program. It was written and directed by Steven Lisberger. \"Tron\" has a distinctive visual style, as it was one of the first films from a major studio to use computer graphics extensively.\n\n\"Tron: Legacy\" is a 2010 science fiction film. Jeff Bridges returns as Kevin Flynn and also, in a digitally de-aged form, plays the film's antagonist, a new version of his CLU program. Bruce Boxleitner also returns as Alan Bradley and, likewise de-aged, as Tron. They are joined by Garrett Hedlund as Sam Flynn, Kevin's son, the film's primary protagonist; Olivia Wilde as digital warrior Quorra; Michael Sheen as Castor, owner of a nightclub within the Grid; and Beau Garrett as Gem, a program that works within the digital world. The film deals with Sam investigating the disappearance of his father twenty years earlier, a quest that ultimately leads him into an isolated digital world created by his father after the events of the first film. Original film director Steven Lisberger acted as a producer and consultant on the film, which was written by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis and directed by first-time director Joseph Kosinski.\n\nWhile never officially approved, it was announced that a third \"Tron\" film was in the works as of March 2015. It was also reported that Joseph Kosinski would return to direct and Olivia Wilde and Garrett Hedlund would reprise their roles from \"Tron: Legacy\".\n\nHowever, in May of the same year, the film was abruptly cancelled. It was reported that at the time of the cancellation, pre-production had almost been completed, with production having been planned to begin Fall 2015, likely in Vancouver, British Columbia. Disney had also been interested in adding Jared Leto to the cast, but an offer and negotiations never commenced.\n\nOn February 28, 2017, during a Q&A session with Joseph Kosinski, he revealed that Tron 3 isn't totally dead, instead saying it was in \"cryogenic freeze\".\n\nOn October 15, 2017, Jared Leto, in a recent interview with Collider, gave an update on the potential Tron reboot, confirming that the project does exist and he is involved. However, since it is in early planning stages, no other details have been said.\n\nIn March 2010, Disney announced that a TV series, entitled \"Tron: Uprising\", was in production. The premiere aired on June 7, 2012, on Disney XD. The series was cancelled after 19 episodes with the last episode airing on January 28, 2013.\n\nSince video games play a central role in the film, many video games based on \"Tron\" have been produced over the years. Atari, Inc. had plans to develop a real \"Space Paranoids\" game, but this was canceled due to the video game crash of 1983, along with arcade adaptations of \"Superman III\" and \"The Last Starfighter\". In 1982, Midway Games released the \"Tron\" arcade game, which consisted of four mini-games based on sequences in the film. This game earned more than the film's initial release. In 1983, Midway released \"Discs of Tron\", a sequel that focused on disc combat.\n\nMattel Electronics released three separate \"Tron\" games (unrelated to the arcade game) for the Intellivision game console in 1982: \"\", \"Tron Maze-A-Tron\", and \"\". \"Deadly Discs\" was later ported to the Atari 2600 (along with an original \"Tron\" game for that platform, \"Adventures of Tron\"), and a version also appeared for the short-lived Aquarius home computer. A special joystick resembling the \"Tron\" arcade game joystick was also created as a free giveaway in a special pack that included both Atari 2600 \"Tron\" video games.\n\nA PC game sequel released for Windows and Macintosh was released on August 26, 2003. In this first person shooter game, the player takes the part of Alan Bradley's son Jet, who is pulled into the computer world to fight a computer virus. A separate version of this game, called \"Tron 2.0 Killer App\", is available for the Xbox, and features new multiplayer modes. An almost completely different game of the same name is also available for the Game Boy Advance, where Tron and a Light Cycle program named Mercury (first seen in \"Tron 2.0\" for the PC) fight their way through the ENCOM computer to stop a virus called The Corruptor. This game includes light cycle, battle tank, and recognizer battle modes, several security-related minigames, and the arcade games \"Tron\" and \"Discs of Tron\". While the Game Boy Advance game is only minimally connected to the PC game, one of the 100 unlockable chips shows a picture of Jet Bradley.\n\nIn 2009, 42 Entertainment released eight, real-life \"Space Paranoids\" arcade machines during the 2009 San Diego Comic Con. They were placed in a recreated Flynn's Arcade near the convention center. The object of the game is to go through the levels and to achieve as many points as possible by destroying Recognizers. The total number of points a person can achieve is 999,000 pts, which is a reference to the score Flynn got in the film, and is a record currently held by the gamer with the initials FLN. You use a pilot-like joystick and a ball to move the turret and tank.\n\nA tie-in video game based upon \"\", titled \"\", released in December 2010. Teaser trailers were released in November 2009, with a longer trailer airing during the Spike Video Game Awards on December 12, 2009. \"Evolution\" was made at the same time as the film, and features heavy cross-over references, with members of the video game developers stating that some of the facts in film have more depth if the game is played first, as the game reveals more about that scene. It will also allow you to explore further parts of the Tron world.\n\nUnlike \"Tron: Evolution\", made for PS3, PSP, Xbox 360 and PC, \"Tron Evolution: Battle Grids\" is made exclusively for the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS, and its storyline predates that of the other versions. In this game you create your own program, this program will meet Quorra and Tron before the events of \"Tron: Legacy\" and they will train him to be the first ISO to win the Grid Games, but before that can happen you will have to battle and defeat the enemies that kidnapped Quorra and threatened that if you participate in the games she would be Derezzed. The video game is developed by n-Space and published by Disney Interactive Studios.\n\nAnnounced at the Games Award 2015, and available immediately afterwards in Early Access Tron RUN/r is described as an \"Action Arcade\" game.\n\nA game based on Disney history, \"Epic Mickey\" features several Tron elements in its Tomorrow City level. Spatter enemies wear the red suits of Sark's minions and one of the robotic Beetleworx of the area has a Lightcycle inspired torso. The boss of the level is Petetronic, a version of Pete dressed as Sark, who you must defeat by deflecting his disc attacks and using either thinner or paint to defeat him, paint turning his circuitry blue and friendly, thinner derezzing him, only to appear as an MCP like program in the alternate ending.\n\nCharacters from the Tron universe are used in \"Kingdom Hearts II\" and \"Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance\". In \"Kingdom Hearts II\", \"Space Paranoids\", a world based on the video game from the original movie, features the characters \"Tron\", \"Commander Sark\", and The \"Master Control Program\" (MCP).\n\nIn \"\", \"The Grid\" another world named after the system from \"\", appears in the game, and features the characters \"Kevin Flynn\", \"Sam\", \"Quorra\", \"CLU\", \"Rinzler\", and The \"Black Guards\".\n\nAn online multiplayer game developed by Disney, had a room based on \"Tron\", with Recognizers and the MCP in the background. There were also multiple furniture items in VMK based on Tron, such as Lightcycle Chairs, Tank Chairs, and a \"Tron\" Arcade Game Cabinet. It also featured the Red Tron suit (Sark) and Blue Tron Suit. VMK is closed as of May 21, 2008.\n\nFeatures abstract versions of characters from as playable characters.\n\nFeatures several Tron-based items including the Identity Disc (weapon pack), Light Runner (ground vehicle), Recognizer (aerial vehicle), and 3 Power Discs (User Control for increased experience, The Grid skydome, and TRON terrain).\n\nFrom 1982 to 1995, \"Tron\" was featured in Disneyland's PeopleMover attraction, as part of \"The World of Tron\", in which the light cycle sequence from the film was projected around park guests as their vehicle passed through a tunnel on the upper level of the Carousel Theater, placing the PeopleMover in the role of a light cycle. The attraction was known as PeopleMover Thru the World of Tron after this sequence was added. From 1977 to 1982, this segment was previously home to the \"SuperSpeed Tunnel,\" in which race cars were projected around the vehicles.\n\nIn 2010, the Epcot Monorail on the Walt Disney World Monorail System received wrap advertisements featuring blue and yellow light cycles on either side of the train to promote \"Tron Legacy\".\n\nElecTRONica was announced on the Disney Parks Blog for Disney California Adventure in Anaheim, California. Disney's \"ElecTRONica\" is an interactive nighttime dance party in Hollywood Pictures Backlot. It is a similar experience to Glow Fest, but with a focus on \"Tron: Legacy\". ElecTRONica features lights, lasers, music, and projections to promote the film. On October 29, 2010, the nighttime show \"World of Color\" began soft-openings after its second show for a \"Tron: Legacy\" themed encore using Daft Punk's original music from , using new effects and projections on Paradise Pier attractions, The segment was added on November 1, 2010 and ended on March 23, 2011. ElecTRONica ended on April 15, 2012 and replaced by Mad T Party.\n\nIn 2016, a roller coaster called TRON Lightcycle Power Run opened in Shanghai Disneyland. Guests board single-seat motorbike roller coasters modeled after light cycles and manufactured by Vekoma. A cloned version of this ride will open at Magic Kingdom before 2021.\n\nA novelization of \"Tron\" was released in 1982, written by American science fiction novelist Brian Daley. It included eight pages of color photographs from the movie. Also that year, Disney Senior Staff Publicist Michael Bonifer authored a book entitled \"The Art of Tron\" which covered aspects of the pre-production and post-production aspects of Tron. To support the film's release in 1982, Disney also published several books targeting children including \"Tron: A Pop-Up Book\", \"Tron: The Storybook\", and \"The Story of Tron\", a book and audio combination (with either 33 RPM 7 inch record or audio cassette).\n\nA nonfiction book about the making of the original film, called \"The Making of Tron: How Tron Changed Visual Effects and Disney Forever\" was published in 2011 and written by William Kallay.\n\nIn 2010, to coincide with the release of \"Tron: Legacy\", a range of new books have been released; including a range of junior novels – \"\"Tron the Junior Novel\" by Alice Alfonsi, \"Tron: Legacy: Derezzed\" by James Gelsey, \"Tron: Legacy: Out of the Dark\" by Tennant Redbank, \"Tron: Legacy: It's Your Call: Initiate Sequence\" by Carla Jablonski. Additional books include \"The Art of Tron: Legacy\" by Justin Springer, Joseph Kosinski, and Darren Gilford, and \"Tron Legacy: The Movie Storybook\"\" by James Ponti.\n\nTo support the release of the film in 1982, Disney briefly ran a Sunday comic strip adaptation of the film.\n\nIn 2003, 88 MPH solicited a mini-series titled \"Tron 2.0: Derezzed\". This comic was canceled before any issues were released.\n\nIn 2005, Slave Labor Graphics announced its six-issue limited series comic, \"\". The first issue was released in April 2006, the second issue in November of the same year. The comic book explores the concept of making a backup copy of a User within the computer system, and how that artificial intelligence might be materialized into the real world. The comic book was written by Landry Walker and Eric Jones, with art in the first two issues by Louie De Martinis. The artist on the last three issues is Mike Shoykhet.\n\nThe comic from Slave Labor Graphics opens with a detailed history of the \"Tron\" universe, providing this previously unseen background on the events that allowed Ed Dillinger and the MCP to rise to power:\n\nIn the early 1970s, a small engineering company called ENCOM introduced a revolutionary type of software designed to direct and streamline the transfer of data between networked machines. Ed Dillinger, the lead programmer on this project, realized the enormous potential of his team's creation and secretly encoded a secondary function to be activated upon installation: to copy the sub-routines of other programs and absorb their functions. This alteration allowed Dillinger to appropriate research and claim it as his own, and he rose quickly through ENCOM’s corporate ranks. This was the beginning of the Master Control Program.\n\nMarvel Comics released a two issue mini-series entitled \"\" in October 2010. The story takes place a year after the original film. To coincide with the release of the sequel \"Tron: Legacy\", Marvel also released in 2010 a comic adaptation of the original 1982 film. It was written by Peter David with art by Mirco Pierfederici.\n\nA manga version of \"Tron: Legacy\" was released by Earth Star Entertainment in Japan on June 30, 2011.\n\nLight cycles were originally fictional vehicles designed by Syd Mead for the simulated world of the \"Tron\" universe. 5 real-life replica light cycles were created by Parker Brothers Concepts in Florida, one of which was sold by Sotheby's for a reported $77,000.\n\nThese futuristic two-wheeled vehicles resemble motorcycles and create walls of colored light. The vehicles were primarily used in a competition between humanoid computer programs, similar to the 1976 arcade game \"Blockade\", which was the first of a genre called \"Snake\". Players are in constant motion on a playfield, creating a wall of light behind them as they move. If players hit a wall, their light cycle explodes, placing them out of the game; the last player in the game wins. Since the original display in \"Tron\", there have been numerous adaptations, as well as references in popular culture.\n\nA light cycle toy, in red and yellow versions, was produced by TOMY as part of the merchandising for the \"Tron\" film, along with action figures scaled to fit inside the toy cycles. Bootleg versions of TOMY's design were produced by other toy manufacturers that came in a wide variety of colors, including blue and silver, but were noticeably smaller than the TOMY-produced toy, too small in fact to accommodate one of the TOMY action figures.\nLight cycles make a return in \"Tron: Legacy\", with new designs by Daniel Simon. According to the press conference at Comic-Con 2009, a new vehicle appears called a \"Light Runner,\" a two-seat version of the light cycle. It is said to be very fast, and has the unique ability to go off the grid on its own power. We also get a glimpse at Kevin Flynn's own cycle, a \"Second Generation Light Cycle\" designed in 1989 by Flynn and “rumor has it it's still the fastest thing on the grid.” It incorporates some of the look of both films.\n\nThe tie-in video game \"\", which is set between the events of \"Tron\" and \"Tron: Legacy\", features light cycles in sections of the single-player mode and in certain game maps for the multiplayer mode. Light cycle use in multiplayer gives players the option to shift back and forth between cycle and foot travel at will, and provides multiple attack and defensive options beyond the classic \"boxing in\" of an opponent. In addition, the light cycles of \"Evolution\" can pass through their own light trails (and the trails of allied players) unharmed.\n\nA more classic interpretation of the lightcycle game is shown in the Wii-Game \"\", which is primarily based on offline multiplayer or singleplayer matches. These lightcycle battles don't allow the player to pass through his own trail but do allow passage through teammates' trails. There is also no option to travel on foot.\n\nA vehicle within \"\", the X-2 Phantom, is actually based upon a Light Cycle, with a slight variation as it bears a Purple theme.\n\nA motorcycle introduced for \"Grand Theft Auto Online\"'s \"Bikers\" update, the \"Shotaro\", heavily resembles a Light Cycle, with its name acting as an allusion to the 1988 Anime film \"AKIRA\".\n"}

It is also called pharmacopuncture, Korean Herb-acupuncture and acupuncture with medicinal herbs.\n\nTraditional Korean Medicine treatment of injecting herbal medicinal substances on the \"gyeonghyeol\" (經穴:Acupuncture points = the points of \"kyungrak\" (=meridians經絡)) which acts as both acupuncture stimulation and direct medicinal dosage.\n\nIt is also known as \"Yakchim\" (藥鍼) Immunization, \"Suchim\" (水针), \"Yakchimyobeop\"(a method of treatment of \"Yakchim\"), \"Hyeolwi\" (穴位) needle therapy. It is a type of medical science of Immunity (免疫医学) injecting to the important \"gyeonghyeol\" (經穴: acupuncture points) ingredients extracted from oriental medical herbs.\n\nIt can also be said that the therapy of a needle for acupuncture is a method of treatment stimulating the human body externally and the medication therapy is stimulating the internal organs internally. It has an intention of improving the effectiveness of treatment by enforcing the two therapies simultaneously. \n\nIn western pharmacodynamic sense, direct injection of medicinal substances into the body promotes quicker steadystate levels of substances either in the local tissue or in the blood stream, thus improving time-efficacy of the medicine (which has been a long concern when treating time-critical patients) \n\nIt was developed by Nam Sang Chun (南相千) from South Korea who had researched the formation of \"kyungrak\" (=meridians經絡) in 1956 and has strengthened the immunity developing into a specialty of acupuncture field and since 1963 he has examined closely the functioning of \"kyungrak\" (=meridians經絡) using a syringe with herbal medication such as \"sanjoin\" (酸棗仁), \"hwanggi\" (黃芪: Astragalus membranaceus Bunge), ginseng (人蔘) and \"nokyong\" (鹿茸: the young antlers of the deer). \n\nIt is distinguished that \"gyeonghyeol\" (經穴:Acupuncture points) has an effect by itself only with the stimulation of the needle, but can be achieved greater therapeutic effect with the injection of specific medicinal herbs. It is being researched and developed in several countries like South Korea, China and Japan and others, where the oriental therapies are prevalent. The department of the career of \"Yakchim\" has been implemented in the Korean Oriental medicine institute on August 26, 1990 in South Korea and the research and the diffusion about \"Yakchim\" (藥鍼) has been progressing actively.\n\nYakChim (藥鍼) is injecting remedy into the Kyonglak (經絡) system in order to maximize the effects and the time. Nowadays YakChim is used widely all around the world at the same time. Injections can be divided into Kije (氣劑) and Yunje. Kije (氣劑) is medicine injected directly injected into Kyonglak (經絡), and Yunje (潤劑) is a medicine that produces Ki (氣). Yunje works as a lubricating device.\n\n\n"}
