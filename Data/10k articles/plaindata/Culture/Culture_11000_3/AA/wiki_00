{"id": "714151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=714151", "title": "A Deepness in the Sky", "text": "A Deepness in the Sky\n\nA Deepness in the Sky is a science fiction novel by American writer Vernor Vinge. Published in 1999, the novel is a loose prequel (set twenty thousand years earlier) to his earlier novel \"A Fire Upon the Deep\" (1992). The title is coined by one of the story's main characters in a debate, in a reference to the hibernating habits of his species and to the vastness of space.\n\nThe plot begins with the discovery of an intelligent alien species on a planet orbiting an anomalous star, dubbed OnOff because for 215 of every 250 years it is dormant, releasing almost no energy. During this period, the planet freezes and its fauna go into hibernation. The planet's inhabitants, called \"Spiders\" by the humans for their resemblance to arachnids, have reached a stage of technological development very similar to that of Earth's humans in the early 20th century, although humans believe that they may once have been capable of space travel. If this is true, then whoever can establish ties with the aliens first could reap unimaginable rewards; humans have made contact with only one other intelligent (but non-technological) alien species in millennia of travel through the stars. Two human groups launch expeditions to the Spider world: the Qeng Ho (pronounced \"Chung Ho\" and named after the explorer Zheng He), traders who have developed a common interstellar culture for humanity; and the Emergents, a civilization that literally enslaves selected human minds and has only recently re-emerged from a Dark Age.\n\nThe Qeng Ho arrive at the OnOff star shortly before the Emergent fleet, a few years before the sun turns on, at which point the Spider civilization will \"wake up\" and continue its climb into a technological civilization. A reception held by the Emergents doubles as a vector to infect the Qeng Ho with a timed \"mindrot\" virus. The Emergents time an ambush to take advantage of the onset of symptoms.\n\nDuring these events, a concurrent history of the Spider civilization unfolds – mainly through the picaresque, and then increasingly political and technocratic, experiences of a small group of liberal-minded and progressive Spiders. Their struggles against ignorance and obsolescent traditions are coloured with oddly human-like descriptions and nomenclature, prefiguring some major plot revelations towards the end of the story.\n\nFar above, after a close fight, the Emergents subjugate the Qeng Ho; but losses to both sides force them to combine and adopt the so-called \"Lurker strategy\", monitoring and aiding the Spiders' technological development, waiting until they build up the massive infrastructure and technological base that the visitors need in order to repair their vessels.\n\nThe mindrot virus originally manifested itself on the Emergents' home world as a devastating plague, but they subsequently mastered it and learned to use it both as a weapon and as a tool for mental domination. Emergent culture uses mindrot primarily in the form of a variant which technicians can manipulate in order to release neurotoxins to specific parts of the brain. An active MRI-type device triggers changes through dia- and paramagnetic biological molecules. By manipulating the brain in this way, Emergent managers induce obsession with a single idea or specialty, which they call Focus, essentially turning people into brilliant appliances. Many Qeng Ho become Focused against their will, and the Emergents retain the rest of the population under mass surveillance, with only a portion of the crew not in suspended animation. The Qeng Ho trading culture gradually starts to dilute this, by demonstrating to the Emergents certain benefits of tolerated and restricted free trade; the two human cultures merge to some extent over the decades of forced co-operation.\n\nPham Nuwen, the founder of the Qeng Ho trading culture, is living aboard the fleet under the pseudonym Pham Trinli, posing as an inept and bumbling fleet elder. He subverts the Emergents' own oppressive security systems through a series of high-risk ruses. During his plotting he begins to admire the Emergents' Focus technology, seeing it as the missing link in his lifelong goal to create a true interstellar empire and break the cycle of collapse-and-rebuild that plagues human planetary civilizations.\n\nThe plan to wrest fleet control from the Emergents, however, requires the co-operation of Ezr Vinh, a much younger Qeng Ho who, through attrition, has become the Qeng Ho \"Fleet Manager\". Ezr's position as the unique liaison officer between Qeng Ho and Emergents leads him to despair, and he accepts Pham Nuwen's offer to join a plot against the Emergents as a way to personal redemption as well as to take revenge against the Emergents. However, his understanding of Pham's ambitions for Focus technology leads to a confrontation between them over the future use of Focus by the Qeng Ho. With new knowledge of the effects and victims of Focus, Pham is forced to admit the cost is too high, and the two reach an agreement and continue their plotting.\n\nThe critical moment comes when the Emergents attempt to provoke a nuclear war on the Spider home-world in order to seize power. The conspirators subvert the Emergents' systems and put their plans in action, but so do a small group of Spiders who have become aware of the humans and have been working in secret for years to subvert their Focused as well. Together, the two sides successfully defeat the ruling class of the Emergents.\n\nThe combined Emergent/Qeng Ho fleet now negotiates with the Spider civilization as a trading partner. Pham announces his plans to free all of the Focused in the entire Emergent civilization, and, if he survives that, to go to the Galactic Center to find the source of the OnOff star and the strange technology remnants that have clearly traveled with it.\n\nThe book discusses some of the problems of trying to maintain an interstellar trading culture without access to superluminal travel or to superluminal communication. Time-measurement details provide an interesting concept in the book: the Qeng Ho measure time primarily in terms of seconds, since the notion of days, months, and years has no usefulness between various star-systems. The timekeeping system uses terms such as kiloseconds and megaseconds. The Qeng Ho's computer and timekeeping systems feature the advent of \"programmer archaeologists\": the Qeng Ho are packrats of computer programs and systems, retaining them over millennia, even as far back to the era of Unix programs (as implied by one passage mentioning that the fundamental time-keeping system is the Unix epoch:\n\nThis massive accumulation of data implies that almost any useful program one could want already exists in the Qeng Ho fleet library, hence the need for computer archaeologists to dig up needed programs, work around their peculiarities and bugs, and assemble them into useful constructs.\n\nWith this work, Vinge introduces \"localizers\" to his set of science-fiction concepts. Localizers are tiny devices which can contain a simple processor, sensors, and short-range communications. Vinge explores how intelligent control can use mesh networking of these devices in ways quite different from those of traditional computer networks.\n\nOnly one concrete connection links \"A Deepness in the Sky\" with \"A Fire Upon the Deep\": the character of Pham Nuwen, the \"Programmer-at-Arms\", who appears in both books. Hints occur about the \"Zones of Thought\" mentioned in \"Fire\". That novel posits that space around the Milky Way is divided into concentric layers called \"Zones\", each being constrained by different laws of physics and each allowing for different degrees of biological and technological advancement. The innermost, the \"Unthinking Depths\", surrounds the galactic core and is incapable of supporting advanced life forms at all. The next layer, the \"Slow Zone\", is roughly equivalent to the real world in behavior and potential. Further out, the zone named the \"Beyond\" can support futuristic technologies such as AI and FTL travel. The outermost zone, the \"Transcend\", contains most of the galactic halo and is populated by incomprehensibly vast and powerful posthuman entities.\n\n\"A Deepness in the Sky\" takes place in the Slow Zone, though Vinge does not explain the connections, and the characters in the story remain unaware of the zones' existence. The sun's inexplicably strange behavior, the unusual planetary system (with only a solitary planet and several asteroid-sized diamonds), and the discovery of \"cavorite\" on the planet may indicate the system originated in the Transcend, though it is currently moving outward from the Unthinking Depths. Vinge's characters speculate that the Spiders descend from an ancient star-faring civilization, and that the anti-gravity material and other strange artifacts have connections with that civilization. Unfortunately, they guess the structure of the Zones (though not the actual properties) backwards, coming to the conclusion that the bright center of the galaxy is the most likely location for advanced civilization. This leads Pham on his path inwards to the Unthinking Depths, and his eventual resurrection.\n\nJoan D. Vinge has indicated that her novel \"The Outcasts of Heaven Belt\" is also set in the Slow Zone of the Zones of Thought setting. Both novels show their spacefaring civilizations using seconds, kiloseconds, megaseconds, and gigaseconds as their primary units of time.\n\n\"Deepness\" won the 2000 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the 2000 John W. Campbell Memorial Award, the 2000 Prometheus Award and the 2004 Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis for Best Foreign Fiction; as well, it was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel, the 2000 Arthur C. Clarke Award,\nand the 2000 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel\n\nNick Gevers called \"Deepness\" \"one of the best constructed and most absorbing space operas of the decade\", and commented that its \"shrewd triumph\" is that neither optimism nor pessimism defeats the other. John Clute lauded it as \"the most extended example of dramatic irony ever published,\" in that not only do none of the characters ever learn the truth about the universe, neither does anyone who has not read \"Fire\"; he did, however, criticize \"the odd dozen-page segments given over to hard-SF geekishness about orbits and computers and stuff\".\n\nThe SF Site's Greg L. Johnson considered the novel to be \"deceptively straight-forward\", and at \"Strange Horizons\", Amy Harlib praised it as \"huge, complex and captivating\" and \"rich and satisfying and deserving of its award\", emphasizing that it is the equal of its predecessor work. Kirkus Reviews described it as a \"chilling, spellbinding dramatization of the horrors of slavery and mind control\", while Publishers Weekly noted that it would \"fully engage\" readers' sense of wonder, and correctly predicted that it would be nominated for the Hugo Award.\n\n\n"}

Since the term \"Semitic\" itself represents a rough category when referring to cultures, as opposed to languages, the definitive bounds of the term \"ancient Semitic religion\" are only approximate.\n\nSemitic traditions and their pantheons fall into regional categories: Canaanite religions of the Levant, the Sumerian tradition–inspired Assyro-Babylonian religion of Mesopotamia, the Ancient Hebrew religion of the \nIsraelites, and Arabian polytheism. Semitic polytheism possibly transitioned into Abrahamic monotheism by way of the god El, whose name \"El\" is a word for \"god\" in Hebrew, cognate to Arabic Allah.\n\nAbbreviations: Ac. Akkadian-Babylonian; Ug. Ugaritic; Pp. Phoenician; Ib. Hebrew; Ar. Arabic; OSA Old South Arabian; Et. Ethiopic\n\n\nWhen the five planets were identified, they were associated with the sun and moon and connected with the chief gods of the Babylonian pantheon. A bilingual list in the British Museum arranges the sevenfold planetary group in the following order:\n\nThe religion of the Assyrian Empire (sometimes called Ashurism) centered on Ashur, patron deity of the city of Assur, and Ishtar, patroness of Nineveh. The last positively recorded worship of Ashur and other Assyrian gods dates back to the 3rd century AD.\n\nAshur, the patron deity of the eponymous capital from the Late Bronze Age, was in constant rivalry with the patron deity of Babylon, Marduk. In Assyria, Ashur eventually superseded Marduk, even becoming the husband of Ishtar.\n\nThe major Assyro-Babylonian and Akkadian gods were:\nMajor Assyro-Babylonian demons and heroes were:\n\nThe Canaanite religion was practiced by people living in the ancient Levant throughout the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Until the excavation (1928 onwards) of the city of Ras Shamra (also known as Ugarit) in Northern Syria and the discovery of its Bronze Age archive of clay tablet alphabetic cuneiform texts, scholars knew little about Canaanite religious practice. Papyrus seems to have been the preferred writing material for scribes at the time. Unlike the papyrus documents found in Egypt, ancient papyri in the Levant have often simply decayed from exposure to the humid Mediterranean climate. As a result, the accounts in the Bible became the primary sources of information on ancient Canaanite religion. Supplementing the Biblical accounts, several secondary and tertiary Greek sources have survived, including Lucian of Samosata's treatise \"De Dea Syria\" (The Syrian Goddess, 2nd century CE), fragments of the \"Phoenician History\" of Sanchuniathon as preserved by Philo of Byblos (c. 64 – 141 CE), and the writings of Damascius ( 458 – after 538). Recent study of the Ugaritic material has uncovered additional information about the religion, supplemented by inscriptions from the Levant and Tel Mardikh archive (excavated in the early 1960s).\n\nThe Canaanite religion shows the clear influence of Mesopotamian and Egyptian religious practices. Like other peoples of the ancient Near East, the Canaanites were polytheistic, with families typically focusing worship on ancestral household gods and goddesses while acknowledging the existence of other deities such as Baal, Anath, and El.\nKings also played an important religious role and in certain ceremonies, such as the sacred marriage of the New Year Festival; Canaanites may have revered their kings as gods.\n\nAccording to the pantheon, known in Ugarit as 'ilhm (Elohim) or the children of El (compare the Biblical \"sons of God\"), called El, fathered the other deities. In the Greek sources he was married to Beruth (Beirut, the city). The pantheon was supposedly obtained by Philo of Byblos from Sanchuniathon of Berythus (Beirut). The marriage of the deity with the city seems to have Biblical parallels with the stories that link Melkart with Tyre, Yahweh with Jerusalem, and Tanit and Baal Hammon with Carthage. El Elyon is mentioned (as \"God Most High\") in Genesis 14.18–19 as the God whose priest was Melchizedek, king of Salem. \n\nPhilo states that the union of El Elyon and his consort resulted in the birth of Uranus and Ge (Greek names for \"Heaven\" and \"Earth\"). This closely parallels the opening verse of the Hebrew Bible, Genesis 1:1—\"In the beginning God (Elohim) created the Heavens (\"Shemayim\") and the Earth\" (\"Eretz\"). It also parallels the story of the Babylonian Anunaki gods.\n\nThe \"Enuma Elish\" has been compared to the Genesis creation narrative. Some writers trace the story of Esther to Babylonian roots.\n\nEl Elyon also appears in Balaam's story in Numbers and in Moses song in Deuteronomy 32.8. The Masoretic Texts suggest:\n\nWhen the Most High ('Elyōn) divided to the nations their inheritance, he separated the sons of man (Ādām); he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the sons of Israel.\n\nRather than \"sons of Israel\", the Septuagint, the Greek Old Testament, or \"angels of God\", and a few versions even have \"huiōn theou\" (sons of God). The Dead Sea Scrolls version of this suggests that there were in fact 70 sons of the Most High God sent to rule over the 70 nations of the Earth. This idea of the 70 nations of Earth, each ruled over by one of the Elohim (sons of God), is also found in Ugaritic texts. The Arslan Tash inscription suggests that each of the 70 sons of El Elyon was bound to their people by a covenant. Thus, Crossan translates:\n\n<poem>The Eternal One ('Olam) has made a covenant oath with us,\nAsherah has made (a pact) with us.\nAnd all the sons of El,\nAnd the great council of all the Holy Ones (Qedesh).\nWith oaths of Heaven and Ancient Earth.</poem>\n\n"}

It stars Jordan Farris as a time-traveling youth who, along with multiple versions of Frankenstein's monster (Eric Gesecus), are pulled into the American Civil War.\n\nAfter Alan Jones is savagely beaten by a street gang, he ends up at the lab of mad scientist Dr. Tanner Finski and his assistant Igor, a child genius. There, Jones discovers that he is the key to an experiment that involves Frankenstein's monster. When the experiment goes wrong, Finski sends Jones and Igor back in time to the American Civil War, where an interdimensional portal has allowed an army of monsters to converge.\n\n\nShooting took place entirely within Oklahoma. Bellgardt recruited local actors to star in his film. For Dr. Finski, he always sought John Ferguson, who had played horror host Count Gregore. Gesecus, a fan of classic \"Frankenstein\" films, won his part partially through his knowledge of the classic monster. Gesecus was initially wary of becoming involved in a local, low budget effort, but his love for the character won out.\n\n\"Army of Frankensteins\" played at the DeadCENTER Film Festival in October 2014. It was released in Japan on August 2, 2014. It was released in the U.S. and Canada on Blu-ray, DVD, on demand, and digital on September 1, 2015.\n\nMegan Sando of the \"Stillwater News Press\" called it a \"hilarious sci-fi adventure\" whose \"gory special effects make up for the sometimes questionable acting\". Mark L. Miller of Ain't It Cool News wrote that it is \"a love letter to those classic horror films of old\". Miller criticized the monster design but said that \"seeing an army of them is amazingly fun\". Amanda Hunt of \"Scream\" magazine rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote that the film's creative and fun gore effects make up for its occasionally unconvincing acting. Jeremy Blitz of DVD Talk rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, \"This film is doomed not so much by its badness, but by its mediocrity.\"\n\nIt won Best Fantasy Film at the 2014 PollyGrind Film Festival and Best Musical Score at the 2014 Melbourne Independent Filmmakers Festival.\n\n"}

This influence of Chinese ceramics has to be viewed in the broader context of the considerable importance of Chinese culture on Islamic arts in general.\n\nDespite the distances involved, there is evidence of some contact between eastern and southwestern Asia from antiquity. Some very early Western influence on Chinese pottery seems to appear from the 3rd–4th century BCE. An Eastern Zhou red earthenware bowl, decorated with slip and inlaid with glass paste, and now in the British Museum, is thought to have imitated metallic vessels, possibly of foreign origin. Foreign influence especially is thought to have encouraged the Eastern Zhou interest in glass decorations.\nContacts between China and Central Asia were formally opened from the 2nd to 1st century BCE through the Silk Road. In the following centuries, a great cultural influx benefited China, embodied by the appearance in China of foreign art, new ideas and religions (especially Buddhism), and new lifestyles. Artistic influences combined a multiplicity of cultures which had intermixed along the Silk Road, especially Hellenistic, Egyptian, Indian and Central Asian cultures, displaying a strong cosmopolitanism.\n\nSuch mixed influences are especially visible in the earthenwares of Northern China in the 6th century, such as those of the Northern Qi (550–577) or the Northern Zhou (557–581). In that period, high quality high-fired earthenware starts to appear, called the \"jeweled type\", which incorporates lotuses from Buddhist art, as well as elements of Sasanian designs such as pearl roundels, lion masks or musicians and dancers. The best of these ceramics use bluish green, yellow or olive glazes.\n\nDirect contacts between the Muslim and Chinese worlds were marked by the Battle of Talas in 751 in Central Asia. Muslim communities are known to have been present in China as early as the 8th century CE, especially in commercial harbours such as Canton and Hangzhou.\n\nFrom the 9th century onwards, Islamic merchants started to import Chinese ceramics, which were at the core of the Indian Ocean luxury trade at that time. These exotic objects were cherished in the Islamic world and also became an inspiration for local potters.\n\nArchaeological finds of Chinese pottery in the Middle East go back to the 8th century, starting with Chinese pottery of the Tang period (618–907). Remains of Tang period (618–907) ceramics have been found in Samarra and Ctesiphon in present-day Iraq, as well as in Nishapur in present-day Iran. These include porcelaneous white wares from Northern Chinese kilns, celadon-glazed stoneware originating in the Yue kilns of Northern Zhejiang, and the splashed stoneware of Changsha kilns in Hunan Province.\n\nChinese pottery was the object of gift-making in Islamic lands: the Islamic writer Muhammad Ibn-al-Husain-Bahaki wrote in 1059 that Ali Ibn Isa, the governor of Khurasan, presented Harun al-Rashid, the Caliph, twenty pieces of Chinese imperial porcelain, the like of which had never been at a caliph's court before, in addition to 2,000 other pieces of porcelain\".\n\nBy the time of the Mongol invasion of China a considerable export trade westwards to the Islamic world was established, and Islamic attempts to imitate Chinese porcelain in their own fritware bodies had begun in the 12th century. These were less successful than those of Korean pottery, but eventually were able to provide attractive local competition to Chinese imports. Chinese production could adapt to the preferences of foreign markets; larger celadon dishes than the Chinese market wanted were favoured for serving princely banquets in the Middle East. Celadon wares were believed there to have the ability to detect poison, by sweating or breaking. After about 1450 celadon wares fell out of fashion in China, and the continuing production, of lower quality, was for export.\n\nThe Islamic market was apparently especially important in the early years of Chinese blue and white porcelain, which appears to have been mainly exported until the Ming; it was called \"Muslim blue\" by the Chinese. Again, large dishes were an export style, and the densely painted decoration of Yuan blue and white borrowed heavily from the arabesques and plant scrolls of Islamic decoration, probably mostly taking the style from metalwork examples, which also provided shapes for some vessels. This style of ornament was then confined to blue and white, and is not found in the red and white painted wares then preferred by the Chinese themselves. The cobalt blue that was used was itself imported from Persia, and the export trade in porcelain was handled by colonies of Muslim merchants in Quanzhou, convenient for the huge Jingdezhen potteries, and other ports to the south.\n\nThe start of the Ming dynasty was quickly followed by a decree of 1368, forbidding trade with foreign countries. This was not entirely successful, and had to be repeated several times, and the giving of lavish imperial diplomatic gifts continued, concentrating on silk and porcelain (19,000 pieces of porcelain in 1383), but it severely set back the export trade. The policy was relaxed under the next emperor after 1403, but had by then greatly stimulated the production of pottery emulating Chinese styles in the Islamic world itself, which was by now reaching a high level of quality in several countries (high enough to fool contemporary Europeans in many cases).\n\nOften Islamic production imitated not the latest Chinese styles, but those of the late Yuan and early Ming. In turn, Chinese potters began in the early 16th century to produce some items in overtly Islamic styles, including jumbled inscriptions in Arabic. These appear to have been made for the growing Chinese Muslim market, and probably those at court wishing to keep up with the Zhengde Emperor's (r. 1505–1521) flirtation with Islam.\n\nYue ware originated in the Yue kilns of Northern Zhejiang, in the site of Jiyuan near Shaoxing, called \"Yuezhou\" (越州) in ancient times. Yue ware was first manufactured from the 2nd century CE, when it consisted in some very precise imitations of bronze vessels, many of which were found in tombs of the Nanjing region. After this initial phase, Yue ware evolved progressively into true ceramic form, and became a true medium of artistic expression. Production in Jiyuan stopped in the 6th century, but expanded to various areas of Zhejiang, especially around the shores of Shanglinhu in Yuyaoxian.\n\nYue ware was highly valued, and was used as tribute for the imperial court in northern China in the 9th century. Significantly, it was also used in China's most revered Famen Temple in Shaanxi Province. Yue ware was exported to the Middle East early on, and shards of Yue ware have been excavated in Samarra, Iraq, in an early example of Chinese influences on Islamic pottery, as well as to East Asia and South Asia as well as East Africa from the 8th to the 11th century.\n\nTang period earthenware shards with low-fired polychrome three-color \"sancai\" glazes from the 9th century were exported to Middle-Eastern countries such as Iraq and Egypt, and have been excavated in Samarra in present-day Iraq and in Nishapur in present-day Iran. These Chinese styles were soon adopted for local Middle-Eastern manufactures. Copies were made by Iraqi craftsmen as soon as the 9th century CE.\n\nIn order to imitate Chinese \"Sancai\", lead glazes were used on top of vessels coated with white slip and a colorless glaze. The coloured lead glazes were then splashed on the surface, where they spread and mixed, according to the slipware technique.\n\nShapes were also imitated, such as the lobed dishes found in Chinese Tang ceramics and silverware which were reproduced in Iraq during the 9–10th century.\n\nConversely, numerous Central Asian and Persian influences were at work in the designs of Chinese \"sancai\" wares: pictures of Central Asian mounted warriors, scenes representing Central Asian musicians, vases in the shape of Middle-Eastern ewers.\n\nSoon after the sancai period, Chinese white ware ceramics also found their way to the Islamic world, and were immediately reproduced. The Chinese white ware was actually porcelain, invented in the 9th century, and used kaolin and high-temperature firing, but Islamic workshops were unable to duplicate its manufacture. Instead, they manufactured fine earthenware bowls with the desired shape, and covered them with a white glaze rendered opaque by the addition of tin, an early example of tin-glazing. The Chinese shapes were also reproduced, seemingly to pass for China-made wares.\n\nIn the 12th century, Islamic manufacturers further developed stone-paste techniques in order to obtain hard bodies approximating the hardness obtained by Chinese porcelain. This technique was used until the 18th century, when the Europeans discovered the Chinese technique for high-firing porcelain clays.\n\nThe Chinese fashion for greenware, or celadon, ware was also transmitted to the Islamic world, where it gave rise to productions using turquoise glazing and fish motifs identical to the ones used in China.\n\nThe technique of cobalt blue decorations seems to have been invented in the Middle East in the 9th century through decorative experimentation on white ware, and the technique of blue-and-white ware was developed in China in the 14th century. On some occasions, Chinese blue and white wares also incorporated Islamic designs, as in the case of some Mamluk brass works which were converted into blue and white Chinese porcelain designs. Chinese blue and white ware then became extremely popular in the Middle East, where both Chinese and Islamic types coexisted.\n\nFrom the 13th century, Chinese pictorial designs, such as flying cranes, dragons and lotus flowers also started to appear in the ceramic productions of the Near East, especially in Syria and Egypt.\nChinese porcelain of the 14th or 15th century was transmitted to the Middle East and the Near East, and especially to the Ottoman Empire either through gifts or through war booty. Chinese designs were extremely influential with the pottery manufacturers at Iznik, Turkey. The Ming \"grape\" design in particular was highly popular and was extensively reproduced under the Ottoman Empire. The style of Persian pottery known as Kubachi ware also absorbed influence from China, imitating both celadons and Ming blue-and-white porcelain.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is based in Tokyo and also in the Place Vendôme in Paris, the city in which they show their main collections during Paris Fashion Week and Paris Men's Fashion Week.\n\nThe Japanese flagship store is in Aoyama, Tokyo's high fashion district. The company also has concept stores Trading Museum Comme des Garçons and 10 Corso Como Comme des Garçons in Tokyo, and stores in Kyoto, Osaka and Fukuoka. Worldwide they have traditional Comme des Garçons stores in Rue du Faubourg St-Honoré in Paris and on West 22nd Street in New York City, as well as stores in Hong Kong, Beijing, Bangkok, Seoul, Singapore, Melbourne and Manila.\n\nSince 2004, Comme des Garçons has developed a market-based department store concept, stocking its main collections, its other brands, such as \"Shirt\", \"Play\", and a wide range of international designers. Its original market store, called Dover Street Market, is in London. In 2010, the company opened I.T Beijing Market Comme des Garçons, which was followed by a new market store in Ginza, Tokyo, in 2012 and New York City in 2013, as well as Berlin more recently.\n\nThe label was started in Tokyo by Rei Kawakubo in 1969 and established as a company Comme des Garçons Co. Ltd in 1973. It is written in Japanese as コム・デ・ギャルソン (\"Komu de Gyaruson\"). It became successful in Japan in the 1970s; a menswear line was added in 1978. The year 1981 saw Comme des Garçons's debut show in Paris. It created a splash for its predominant use of black and distressed fabrics. Throughout the 1980s, Comme des Garçons's clothes often were associated with a 'distressed' and 'punk' oriented style.\n\nComme des Garçons's designer fashion lines are designed and produced in Japan. Lines including \"Comme des Garçons Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons Noir, Comme des Garçons Homme, Comme des Garçons Honme Plus, Comme des Garçons Man, Comme des Garçons Deux and Comme des Garçons Shirt\", are all handmade. This is because Comme des Garçons adamantly values the quality of hand-made garments, reflected in the more expensive price and longevity of their products. Play, the company's luxury casual streetwear line, is mainly produced in Japan, Spain, and Turkey, with France's Play factory still utilizing many hand-made procedures as opposed to Japan, Spain, and Turkey's production line factory. This is because France's factory also produces hand-made only lines, including \"Tricot Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons Homme Plus Evergreen, and Junya Watanabe Comme Des Garçons\". It is believed that all fabrics are produced in Japan, but some China and Australia sold pieces are hand-finished in France for quality control purposes (distinguishable by the hand stitched heart emblem). In an article for \"Business of Fashion\" in April 2017, Tim Blanks reported generated revenue for CDG and its affiliates as \"over $280 million a year\".\n\nComme des Garçons collections are designed in the Comme des Garçons studio in Aoyama, Tokyo and are manufactured in Japan, France, Spain, and Turkey. The company has over the years recurrently associated itself with the arts and cultural projects internationally. The 1997 spring-summer collection, often referred to the \"lumps and bumps\" collection, which contained fabric in bulk and balls on the garments. This led to a collaboration, also in 1997, between Rei Kawakubo and New York-based choreographer Merce Cunningham called \"Scenario\". The 2006 autumn/winter collection dealt with the concept of the \"persona\", the different ways we present ourselves to the world. Fusing tailored menswear with more feminine elements such as corsets and flower printed dress fabrics, \"Persona\" was another collection that combined the feminine with the masculine by Comme des Garçons.\n\nJunya Watanabe and, as of recently, Tao Kurihara have started their own sub-labels under the Comme des Garçons name to much acclaim. Both also were involved in designing for the casual women's knitwear line \"Comme des Garçons Tricot\".\n\nComme des Garçons have collaborated with various other labels over the years including Fred Perry, Levi's Converse All Star, Speedo, Nike, Moncler, Lacoste, Cutler and Gross, Chrome Hearts, Hammerthor, S. N. S. Herning, Louis Vuitton, Supreme, and many others. Comme des Garçons and H&M collaborated on a collection which was released in the fall of 2008.\n\nNotably, Björk wears Comme des Garçons in the music video for \"Isobel\". Other celebrities who have worn Comme des Garçons include Lady Gaga, Matt Bellamy, Alexander McQueen, Krikor Jabotian, Chloë Sevigny, Kanye West, Usher, Tilda Swinton, Herb Ritts, Tatiana Sorokko, Karl Lagerfeld, Heidi Albertsen, Mary-Kate Olsen, Vincent Ng, Selma Blair, Leila Aldik, Drake, Joe Jonas, Ellen DeGeneres, ASAP Rocky, 2 Chainz, Frank Ocean who devoted a song to\nand her. John Waters, who devoted a chapter of his 2010 book \"Role Models\" to Comme des Garçons and Rei Kawakubo. Swedish musician Jonna Lee collaborated with Comms des Garçons in the creation of her audiovisual album \"Everyone Afraid to Be Forgotten\", where the fashion house designed the costumes for the film.\n\nAfter the Paris début, Comme des Garçons exhibited photographs by Peter Lindbergh at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 1986. In 1990, they held an exhibition of sculpture. The year 2005 saw an exhibition in Shinjuku, Tokyo of Comme Des Garçons advertising and graphic designs.\n\nIn August 2010, Comme des Garçons opened a , six-level flagship store in Seoul, South Korea, featuring a branded art-exhibition space, the company's first outside Japan.\n\nCommonly known for its heart-shaped logo with two eyes, Comme Des Garçons Play is Comme Des Garçons' casual luxury line. It is a more accessible variation of Comme Des Garcons's other lines. Directed at the younger market, Play is Comme Des Garcon's best selling clothes line.\n\nAfter Play made its debut on celebrities such as Kanye West, Pharell Williams, and Justin Timberlake, Play introduced collaborations with Nike, Jordan, Supreme, and Louis Vuitton, and was quickly viewed as a prominent international fashion brand. Nowadays, Comme Des Garçons is mainly recognized for the heart-eyes logo found on Play pieces. \"Dover Street Market Group\" primarily carries Play products as opposed to those from Comme Des Garçons's more high-end lines.\n\nComme des Garçons also produces a line of agendered fragrances, most of which are unconventional in the world of perfume, in the same spirit as the label's garments.\n\nThe company released its first fragrance, \"Comme des Garçons\", in 1994. 1998 saw the release of Comme des Garçons's first \"anti-perfume\" \"Odeur 53\", a blend of 53 non-traditional notes to create a modern and striking scent. Some of these notes are: oxygen, flash of metal, wash drying in the wind, mineral carbon, sand dunes, nail polish, cellulose, pure air of the high mountains, burnt rubber, and flaming rock. Director John Waters and architect Stephen Alesch both wear the fragrance.\n\nComme des Garçons released the perfume for the Luxe series \"Champaca\", for which artist Katerina Jebb produced the visuals.\n\nSince 2002, the perfume line joined Puig company to become part of its catalogue of fragrances. The company Puig owns a partial license for Comme des Garçons fragrances under company of, Comme des Garçons Parfums. Since granting a partial license for fragrances to Puig, Joffe has also created a division of fragrances within the Comme des Garçons company itself named, Comme des Garçons Parfums Parfums.\n\nComme des Garçons developed a unisex fragrance, G I R L, with Pharrell Williams, released on 28 August 2014. Artist KAWS designed the bottle.\n\nSignature Comme des Garçons boutiques are located in London (Dover Street Market), Paris, New York City, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, St. Petersburg, Tokyo (2x), Kyoto, Osaka, Fukuoka. The company also maintains concessions at select department stores, such as Isetan. In Paris, a Comme des Garçons perfumery can be found at 23 Place Marché St-Honoré.\n\nComme des Garçons opened the first of their 'Guerrilla' stores in 2004 in Berlin. The aim of the Guerrilla stores is to be open for only one year and to spend a minimal amount of money on the interiors. The stores also are to be located away from fashionable hubs and districts of a city. Comme des Garçons Guerrilla stores have been opened (and subsequently closed) in Reykjavik, Warsaw, Helsinki, Singapore, Stockholm, and Athens, amongst others. In July 2007, a Guerrilla Store opened in the Achrafieh district of Beirut, Lebanon, and in February 2008, a Guerrilla Store opened in downtown Los Angeles, the first in the United States. In November 2008, they opened another Guerilla store in the west end of Glasgow. 2004 also saw the opening in London of Dover Street Market (DSM), a multilevel store conceptualised by Rei Kawakubo.\n\nIn December 2009, Comme des Garçons opened a store in Hong Kong called \"Under The Ground\". Hong Kong also has had a Guerrilla store opened and closed in previous years, run by Silly Thing Hong Kong. In March 2012, Comme des Garçons opened a store in One Rockwell, Rockwell Center, Manila. Also, the first Dover Street Market in Japan opened in Ginza. In December 2013, Dover Street Market in New York City opened.\n\nStarting in May 2017, Rei Kawakubo will be the subject of one of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's fashion exhibitions in New York. \"Vogue\" magazine and the Metropolitan Museum in New York have announced that the exhibition dedicated to Kawakubo is scheduled for its 2017 season between 4 May 2017 and 4 September 2017. In an interview with \"Vogue\" in April 2017, Andrew Bolton, the curator for the Kawakubo exhibit at the Met stated: “I really think her influence is so huge, but sometimes it’s subtle. It’s not about copying her; it’s the purity of her vision... Rei was really involved in the design of the exhibit”. Bolton also stated that the exhibit in May 2017 will be an austere, all-white maze hosting approximately 150 Comme ensembles. Both the exhibit and accompanying book by Bolton are based upon the recurrent fashion dichotomies concentrating on eight thematic oppositions listed as: (1) fashion/antifashion; (2) design/not design; (3) model/multiple; (4) then/now; (5) high/low; (6) self/other; (7) object/subject; and (8) clothes/not clothes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7660", "title": "Comparative method", "text": "Comparative method\n\nIn linguistics, the comparative method is a technique for studying the development of languages by performing a feature-by-feature comparison of two or more languages with common descent from a shared ancestor, in order to extrapolate back to infer the properties of that ancestor. The comparative method may be contrasted with the method of internal reconstruction, in which the internal development of a single language is inferred by the analysis of features within that language. Ordinarily both methods are used together to reconstruct prehistoric phases of languages, to fill in gaps in the historical record of a language, to discover the development of phonological, morphological, and other linguistic systems, and to confirm or refute hypothesised relationships between languages.\n\nThe comparative method was developed over the 19th century. Key contributions were made by the Danish scholars Rasmus Rask and Karl Verner and the German scholar Jacob Grimm. The first linguist to offer reconstructed forms from a proto-language was August Schleicher, in his \"Compendium der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen\", originally published in 1861. Here is Schleicher's explanation of why he offered reconstructed forms:\nIn the present work an attempt is made to set forth the inferred Indo-European original language side by side with its really existent derived languages. Besides the advantages offered by such a plan, in setting immediately before the eyes of the student the final results of the investigation in a more concrete form, and thereby rendering easier his insight into the nature of particular Indo-European languages, there is, I think, another of no less importance gained by it, namely that it shows the baselessness of the assumption that the non-Indian Indo-European languages were derived from Old-Indian (Sanskrit).\n\nThe comparative method aims to prove that two or more historically attested languages descend from a single proto-language by comparing lists of cognate terms. From them, regular sound correspondences between the languages are established, and a sequence of regular sound changes can then be postulated, which allows the reconstruction of a proto-language. Relation is deemed certain only if at least a partial reconstruction of the common ancestor is feasible, and if regular sound correspondences can be established—with chance similarities ruled out.\n\n\"Descent\" is defined as transmission across the generations: children learn a language from the parents' generation and after being influenced by their peers transmit it to the next generation, and so on. For example, a continuous chain of speakers across the centuries links Vulgar Latin to all of its modern descendants.\n\nTwo languages are \"genetically related\" if they descended from the same ancestor language. For example, Italian and French both come from Latin and therefore belong to the same family, the Romance languages. Having a large component of vocabulary from a certain origin is not sufficient to establish relatedness: for example, as a result of heavy borrowing from Arabic into Persian, Modern Persian in fact takes more of its vocabulary from Arabic than from its direct ancestor, Proto-Indo-Iranian, but Persian remains a member of the Indo-Iranian family and is not considered \"related\" to Arabic.\n\nHowever, it is possible for languages to have different degrees of relatedness. English, for example, is related both to German and to Russian, but is more closely related to the former than to the latter. Although all three languages share a common ancestor, Proto-Indo-European, English and German also share a more recent common ancestor, Proto-Germanic, while Russian does not. Therefore, English and German are considered to belong to a different subgroup, the Germanic languages.\n\n\"Shared retentions\" from the parent language are not sufficient evidence of a sub-group. For example, German and Russian both retain from Proto-Indo-European a contrast between the dative case and the accusative case, which English has lost. However, this similarity between German and Russian is not evidence that German is more closely related to Russian than to English; it only means that the \"innovation\" in question—the loss of the accusative/dative distinction—happened more recently in English than the divergence of English from German. The division of related languages into sub-groups is more certainly accomplished by finding \"shared linguistic innovations\" differentiating them from the parent language, rather than shared features retained from the parent language.\n\nLanguages have been compared since antiquity. For example, in the 1st century BC the Romans were aware of the similarities between Greek and Latin, which they explained mythologically, as the result of Rome being a Greek colony speaking a debased dialect. In the 9th or 10th century AD, Yehuda Ibn Quraysh compared the phonology and morphology of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic, but attributed this resemblance to the Biblical story of Babel, with Abraham, Isaac and Joseph retaining Adam's language, with other languages at various removes becoming more altered from the original Hebrew.\n\nIn publications of 1647 and 1654, Marcus van Boxhorn first described a rigid methodology for historical linguistic comparisons and proposed the existence of an Indo-European proto-language (which he called \"Scythian\") unrelated to Hebrew, but ancestral to Germanic, Greek, Romance, Persian, Sanskrit, Slavic, Celtic and Baltic languages. The Scythian theory was further developed by Andreas Jäger (1686) and William Wotton (1713), who made early forays to reconstruct this primitive common language. In 1710 and 1723 Lambert ten Kate first formulated the regularity of sound laws, introducing among others, the term root vowel.\n\nAnother early systematic attempt to prove the relationship between two languages on the basis of similarity of grammar and lexicon was made by the Hungarian János Sajnovics in 1770, when he attempted to demonstrate the relationship between Sami and Hungarian (work that was later extended to the whole Finno-Ugric language family in 1799 by his countryman Samuel Gyarmathi), But the origin of modern historical linguistics is often traced back to Sir William Jones, an English philologist living in India, who in 1786 made his famous \nThe Sanscrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists. There is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the Gothick and the Celtick, though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanscrit; and the old Persian might be added to the same family.\n\nThe comparative method developed out of attempts to reconstruct the proto-language mentioned by Jones, which he did not name, but which subsequent linguists labelled Proto-Indo-European (PIE). The first professional comparison between the Indo-European languages known then was made by the German linguist Franz Bopp in 1816. Though he did not attempt a reconstruction, he demonstrated that Greek, Latin and Sanskrit shared a common structure and a common lexicon. Friedrich Schlegel in 1808 first stated the importance of using the eldest possible form of a language when trying to prove its relationships; in 1818, Rasmus Christian Rask developed the principle of regular sound-changes to explain his observations of similarities between individual words in the Germanic languages and their cognates in Greek and Jacob Grimm—better known for his \"Fairy Tales\"—in \"Deutsche Grammatik\" (published 1819–1837 in four volumes) made use of the comparative method in attempting to show the development of the Germanic languages from a common origin, the first systematic study of diachronic language change.\n\nBoth Rask and Grimm were unable to explain apparent exceptions to the sound laws that they had discovered. Although Hermann Grassmann explained one of these anomalies with the publication of Grassmann's law in 1862, Karl Verner made a methodological breakthrough in 1875 when he identified a pattern now known as Verner's law, the first sound-law based on comparative evidence showing that a phonological change in one phoneme could depend on other factors within the same word (such as the neighbouring phonemes and the position of the accent), now called \"conditioning environments\".\n\nSimilar discoveries made by the \"Junggrammatiker\" (usually translated as \"Neogrammarians\") at the University of Leipzig in the late 19th century led them to conclude that all sound changes were ultimately regular, resulting in the famous statement by Karl Brugmann and Hermann Osthoff in 1878 that \"sound laws have no exceptions\". This idea is fundamental to the modern comparative method, since the method necessarily assumes regular correspondences between sounds in related languages, and consequently regular sound changes from the proto-language. This \"Neogrammarian Hypothesis\" led to application of the comparative method to reconstruct Proto-Indo-European, with Indo-European being at that time by far the most well-studied language family. Linguists working with other families soon followed suit, and the comparative method quickly became the established method for uncovering linguistic relationships.\n\nThere is no fixed set of steps to be followed in the application of the comparative method, but some steps are suggested by Lyle Campbell and Terry Crowley, both authors of introductory texts in historical linguistics. The abbreviated summary below is based on their concepts of how to proceed.\n\nThis step involves making lists of words that are likely cognates among the languages being compared. If there is a regularly recurring match between the phonetic structure of basic words with similar meanings a genetic kinship can probably be established. For example, looking at the Polynesian family linguists might come up with a list similar to the following (a list actually used by them would be much longer):\n\nBorrowings or false cognates can skew or obscure the correct data. For example, English \"taboo\" () is like the six Polynesian forms due to borrowing from Tongan into English, and not because of a genetic similarity. This problem can usually be overcome by using basic vocabulary—such as kinship terms, numbers, body parts, pronouns, and other basic terms. Nonetheless, even basic vocabulary can be sometimes borrowed. Finnish, for example, borrowed the word for \"mother\", \"äiti\", from Gothic \"aiþei\".; English borrowed the pronouns \"they\", \"them\", and \"their(s)\" from Norse; and Thai (along with various other East Asian languages) borrowed its numbers from Chinese. An extreme case is represented by Pirahã, a Muran language of South America, which, it is controversially claimed, borrowed all its pronouns from Nheengatu.\n\nThe next step involves determining the regular sound-correspondences exhibited by the lists of potential cognates. For example, in the Polynesian data above, it is apparent that words that contain \"t\" in most of the languages listed have cognates in Hawaiian with \"k\" in the same position. This is visible in multiple cognate sets: the words glossed as 'one', 'three', 'man', and 'taboo' all show this relationship. This situation is termed a \"regular correspondence\" between \"k\" in Hawaiian and \"t\" in the other Polynesian languages. Similarly, in those data a regular correspondence can be seen between Hawaiian and Rapanui \"h\", Tongan and Samoan \"f\", Maori \"ɸ\", and Rarotongan \"ʔ\".\n\nMere phonetic similarity, as between English \"day\" and Latin \"dies\" (both with the same meaning), has no probative value. English initial \"d-\" does not \"regularly\" match —it is not possible to assemble a large set of English and Latin non-borrowed cognates such that English \"d\" repeatedly and consistently corresponds to Latin \"d\" at the beginning of a word—and whatever sporadic matches can be observed are due either to chance (as in the above example) or to borrowing (for example, Latin \"diabolus\" and English \"devil\"—both ultimately of Greek origin). English and Latin \"do\" exhibit a regular correspondence of \"t-\" : \"d-\" (where the notation \"A : B\" means \"A corresponds to B\"); for example,\n\nIf there are many regular correspondence sets of this kind (the more the better), then a common origin becomes a virtual certainty, particularly if some of the correspondences are non-trivial or unusual.\n\nDuring the late 18th to late 19th century, two major developments improved the method's effectiveness.\n\nFirst, it was found that many sound changes are conditioned by a specific \"context\". For example, in both Greek and Sanskrit, an aspirated stop evolved into an unaspirated one, but only if a second aspirate occurred later in the same word; this is Grassmann's law, first described for Sanskrit by Sanskrit grammarian Pāṇini and promulgated by Hermann Grassmann in 1863.\n\nSecond, it was found that sometimes sound changes occurred in contexts that were later lost. For instance, in Sanskrit velars (\"k\"-like sounds) were replaced by palatals (\"ch\"-like sounds) whenever the following vowel was \"*i\" or \"*e\". Subsequent to this change, all instances of \"*e\" were replaced by \"a\". The situation would have been unreconstructable, had not the original distribution of \"e\" and \"a\" been recoverable from the evidence of other Indo-European languages. For instance, the Latin suffix \"que\", \"and\", preserves the original \"*e\" vowel that caused the consonant shift in Sanskrit:\n\nVerner's Law, discovered by Karl Verner 1875, provides a similar case: the voicing of consonants in Germanic languages underwent a change that was determined by the position of the old Indo-European accent. Following the change, the accent shifted to initial position. Verner solved the puzzle by comparing the Germanic voicing pattern with Greek and Sanskrit accent patterns.\n\nThis stage of the comparative method, therefore, involves examining the correspondence sets discovered in step 2 and seeing which of them apply only in certain contexts. If two (or more) sets apply in complementary distribution, they can be assumed to reflect a single original phoneme: \"some sound changes, particularly conditioned sound changes, can result in a proto-sound being associated with more than one correspondence set\".\n\nFor example, the following potential cognate list can be established for Romance languages, which descend from Latin:\n\nThey evidence two correspondence sets, \"k : k\" and \"k : :\n\nSince French \"\" only occurs before \"a\" where the other languages also have \"a\", while French \"k\" occurs elsewhere, the difference is due to different environments (being before an \"a\" conditions the change) and the sets are complementary. They can therefore be assumed to reflect a single proto-phoneme (in this case \"*k\", spelled |c| in Latin). The original Latin words are \"corpus\", \"crudus\", \"catena\" and \"captiare\", all with an initial k-sound. If more evidence along these lines were given, one might conclude an alteration of the original k took place because of a different environment.\n\nA more complex case involves consonant clusters in Proto-Algonquian. The Algonquianist Leonard Bloomfield used the reflexes of the clusters in four of the daughter languages to reconstruct the following correspondence sets:\n\nAlthough all five correspondence sets overlap with one another in various places, they are not in complementary distribution, and so Bloomfield recognized that a different cluster must be reconstructed for each set; his reconstructions were, respectively, \"*hk\", \"*xk\", \"*čk\" (=), \"*šk\" (=), and \"çk\" (where \"x\" and \"ç\" are arbitrary symbols, not attempts to guess the phonetic value of the proto-phonemes).\n\nTypology assists in deciding what reconstruction best fits the data. For example, the voicing of voiceless stops between vowels is common, but not the devoicing of voiced stops in that environment. If a correspondence \"-t-\" : \"-d-\" between vowels is found in two languages, the proto-phoneme is more likely to be \"*-t-\", with a development to the voiced form in the second language. The opposite reconstruction would represent a rare type.\n\nHowever, unusual sound changes do occur. The Proto-Indo-European word for \"two\", for example, is reconstructed as \"*dwō\", which is reflected in Classical Armenian as \"erku\". Several other cognates demonstrate a regular change \"*dw-\" → \"erk-\" in Armenian. Similarly, in Bearlake, a dialect of the Athabaskan language of Slavey, there has been a sound change of Proto-Athabaskan \"*ts\" → Bearlake '. It is very unlikely that \"*dw-\" changed directly into \"erk-\" and \"*ts\" into ', but instead they probably went through several intermediate steps to arrive at the later forms. It is not phonetic similarity which matters when utilizing the comparative method, but regular sound correspondences.\n\nBy the principle of economy, the reconstruction of a proto-phoneme should require as few sound changes as possible to arrive at the modern reflexes in the daughter languages. For example, Algonquian languages exhibit the following correspondence set:\n\nThe simplest reconstruction for this set would be either \"*m\" or \"*b\". Both \"*m\" → \"b\" and \"*b\" → \"m\" are likely. Because \"m\" occurs in five of the languages, and \"b\" in only one, if \"*b\" is reconstructed, then it is necessary to assume five separate changes of \"*b\" → \"m\", whereas if \"*m\" is reconstructed, it is only necessary to assume a single change of \"*m\" → \"b\". \"*m\" would be most economical. (This argument assumes that the languages other than Arapaho are at least partly independent of each other. If they all formed a common subgroup, the development \"*b\" → \"m\" would only have to be assumed to have occurred once.)\n\nIn the final step, the linguist checks to see how the proto-phonemes fit the known typological constraints. For example, a hypothetical system,\nhas only one voiced stop, \"*b\", and although it has an alveolar and a velar nasal, \"*n\" and \"*ŋ\", there is no corresponding labial nasal. However, languages generally (though not always) tend to maintain symmetry in their phonemic inventories. In this case, the linguist might attempt to investigate the possibilities that what was earlier reconstructed as \"*b\" is in fact \"*m\", or that the \"*n\" and \"*ŋ\" are in fact \"*d\" and \"*g\".\n\nEven a symmetrical system can be typologically suspicious. For example, the traditional Proto-Indo-European stop inventory is:\n\nAn earlier voiceless aspirated row was removed on grounds of insufficient evidence. Since the mid-20th century, a number of linguists have argued that this phonology is implausible; that it is extremely unlikely for a language to have a voiced aspirated (breathy voice) series without a corresponding voiceless aspirated series. Thomas Gamkrelidze and Vyacheslav Ivanov provided a potential solution, arguing that the series traditionally reconstructed as plain voiced should in fact be reconstructed as glottalized—either implosive or ejective . The plain voiceless and voiced aspirated series would thus be replaced by just voiceless and voiced, with aspiration being a non-distinctive quality of both. This example of the application of linguistic typology to linguistic reconstruction has become known as the Glottalic Theory. It has a large number of proponents but is not generally accepted. As an alternative, the voiceless aspirated row was restored.\n\nThe reconstruction of proto-sounds logically precedes the reconstruction of grammatical morphemes (word-forming affixes and inflectional endings), patterns of declension and conjugation, and so on. The full reconstruction of an unrecorded protolanguage is an open-ended task.\n\nThe limitations of the comparative method were recognized by the very linguists who developed it, but it is still seen as a valuable tool. In the case of Indo-European, the method seemed to at least partially validate the centuries-old search for an Ursprache, the original language. These others were presumed ordered in a family tree, becoming the tree model of the neogrammarians.\n\nThe archaeologists followed suit, attempting to find archaeological evidence of a culture or cultures that could be presumed to have spoken a proto-language, such as Vere Gordon Childe's \"The Aryans: a study of Indo-European origins\", 1926. Childe was a philologist turned archaeologist. These views culminated in the \"Siedlungsarchaologie\", or \"settlement-archaeology\", of Gustaf Kossinna, becoming known as \"Kossinna's Law\". He asserted that cultures represent ethnic groups, including their languages. It was rejected as a law in the post–World War II era. The fall of Kossinna's Law removed the temporal and spatial framework previously applied to many proto-languages. Fox concludes:\nThe Comparative Method \"as such\" is not, in fact, historical; it provides evidence of linguistic relationships to which we may give a historical interpretation. ...[Our increased knowledge about the historical processes involved] has probably made historical linguists less prone to equate the idealizations required by the method with historical reality. ...Provided we keep [the interpretation of the results and the method itself] apart, the Comparative Method can continue to be used in the reconstruction of earlier stages of languages.\n\nProto-languages can be verified in many historical instances, such as Latin. Although no longer a law, settlement-archaeology is known to be essentially valid for some cultures that straddle history and prehistory, such as the Celtic Iron Age (mainly Celtic) and Mycenaean civilization (mainly Greek). None of these models can be or have been completely rejected, and yet none alone are sufficient.\n\nThe foundation of the comparative method, and of comparative linguistics in general, is the Neogrammarians' fundamental assumption that \"sound laws have no exceptions\". When it was initially proposed, critics of the Neogrammarians proposed an alternate position, summarized by the maxim \"each word has its own history\". Several types of change do in fact alter words in non-regular ways. Unless identified, they may hide or distort laws and cause false perceptions of relationship.\n\nAll languages borrow words from other languages in various contexts. They are likely to have followed the laws of the languages from which they were borrowed rather than the laws of the borrowing language.\n\nBorrowing on a larger scale occurs in areal diffusion, when features are adopted by contiguous languages over a geographical area. The borrowing may be phonological, morphological or lexical. A false proto-language over the area may be reconstructed for them or may be taken to be a third language serving as a source of diffused features.\n\nSeveral areal features and other influences may converge to form a sprachbund, a wider region sharing features that appear to be related but are diffusional. For instance, the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area suggested several false classifications of such languages as Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese before it was recognized.\n\nSporadic changes, such as irregular inflections, compounding, and abbreviation, do not follow any laws. For example, the Spanish words \"palabra\" ('word'), \"peligro\" ('danger') and \"milagro\" ('miracle') should have been \"parabla\", \"periglo\", \"miraglo\" by regular sound changes from the Latin \"parabŏla\", \"perīcŭlum\" and \"mīrācŭlum\", but the \"r\" and \"l\" changed places by sporadic metathesis.\n\nAnalogy is the sporadic change of a feature to be like another feature in the same or a different language. It may affect a single word or be generalized to an entire class of features, such as a verb paradigm. For example, the Russian word for \"nine\", by regular sound changes from Proto-Slavic, should have been , but is in fact . It is believed that the initial ' changed to ' under influence of the word for \"ten\" in Russian, .\n\nStudents of contemporary language changes, such as William Labov, note that even a systematic sound change is at first applied in an unsystematic fashion, with the percentage of its occurrence in a person's speech dependent on various social factors. The sound change gradually spreads, a process known as lexical diffusion. While not invalidating the Neogrammarians' axiom that \"sound laws have no exceptions\", their gradual application shows that they do not always apply to all lexical items at the same time. Hock notes, \"While it probably is true in the long run every word has its own history, it is not justified to conclude as some linguists have, that therefore the Neogrammarian position on the nature of linguistic change is falsified.\"\n\nThe comparative method is used to construct a tree model (German \"Stammbaum\") of language evolution, in which daughter languages are seen as branching from the proto-language, gradually growing more distant from it through accumulated phonological, morpho-syntactic, and lexical changes.\n\nThe tree model features nodes that are presumed to be distinct proto-languages existing independently in distinct regions during distinct historical times. The reconstruction of unattested proto-languages lends itself to that illusion: they cannot be verified and the linguist is free to select whatever definite times and places for them seem best. Right from the outset of Indo-European studies, however, Thomas Young said:It is not, however, very easy to say what the definition should be that should constitute a separate language, but it seems most natural to call those languages distinct, of which the one cannot be understood by common persons in the habit of speaking the other ... Still, however, it may remain doubtfull whether the Danes and the Swedes could not, in general, understand each other tolerably well ... nor is it possible to say if the twenty ways of pronouncing the sounds, belonging to the Chinese characters, ought or ought not to be considered as so many languages or dialects... But, ... the languages so nearly allied must stand next to each other in a systematic order…\n\nThe assumption of uniformity in a proto-language, implicit in the comparative method, is problematic. Even in small language communities there are always dialect differences, whether based on area, gender, class, or other factors. The Pirahã language of Brazil is spoken by only several hundred people, but it has at least two different dialects, one spoken by men and one by women. Campbell points out:\nIt is not so much that the comparative method 'assumes' no variation; rather, it is just that there is nothing built into the comparative method which would allow it to address variation directly...This assumption of uniformity is a reasonable idealization; it does no more damage to the understanding of the language than, say, modern reference grammars do which concentrate on a language's general structure, typically leaving out consideration of regional or social variation.\n\nDifferent dialects, as they evolve into separate languages, remain in contact with one another and influence each other. Even after they are considered distinct, languages near to one another continue to influence each other, often sharing grammatical, phonological, and lexical innovations. A change in one language of a family may spread to neighboring languages; and multiple waves of change are communicated like waves across language and dialect boundaries, each with its own randomly delimited range. If a language is divided into an inventory of features, each with its own time and range (isoglosses), they do not all coincide. History and prehistory may not offer a time and place for a distinct coincidence, as may be the case for proto-Italic, in which case the proto-language is only a concept. However, Hock observes:\n\nThe discovery in the late nineteenth century that isoglosses can cut across well-established linguistic boundaries at first created considerable attention and controversy. And it became fashionable to oppose a wave theory to a tree theory... Today, however, it is quite evident that the phenomena referred to by these two terms are complementary aspects of linguistic change...\n\nThe reconstruction of unknown proto-languages is inherently subjective. In the Proto-Algonquian example above, the choice of \"*m\" as the parent phoneme is only \"likely\", not \"certain\". It is conceivable that a Proto-Algonquian language with \"*b\" in those positions split into two branches, one which preserved \"*b\" and one which changed it to \"*m\" instead; and while the first branch only developed into Arapaho, the second spread out wider and developed into all the other Algonquian tribes. It is also possible that the nearest common ancestor of the Algonquian languages used some other sound instead, such as \"*p\", which eventually mutated to \"*b\" in one branch and to \"*m\" in the other. While examples of strikingly complicated and even circular developments are indeed known to have occurred (such as PIE \"*t\" > Pre-Proto-Germanic \"*þ\" > PG \"*ð\" > Proto-West-Germanic \"*d\" > Old High German \"t\" in \"fater\" > Modern German \"Vater\"), in the absence of any evidence or other reason to postulate a more complicated development, the preference of a simpler explanation is justified by the principle of parsimony, also known as Occam's razor. Since reconstruction involves many of these choices, some linguists prefer to view the reconstructed features as abstract representations of sound correspondences, rather than as objects with a historical time and place.\n\nThe existence of proto-languages and the validity of the comparative method is verifiable in cases where the reconstruction can be matched to a known language, which may only be known as a shadow in the loanwords of another language. For example, Finnic languages such as Finnish have borrowed many words from an early stage of Germanic, and the shape of the loans matches the forms that have been reconstructed for Proto-Germanic. Finnish \"kuningas\" 'king' and \"kaunis\" 'beautiful' match the Germanic reconstructions *\"kuningaz\" and *\"skauniz\" (> German \"König\" 'king', \"schön\" 'beautiful').\n\nThe Wave model was developed in the 1870s as an alternative to the tree model, in order to represent the historical patterns of language diversification. Both the tree-based and the wave-based representations are compatible with the Comparative Method.\n\nBy contrast, some approaches are incompatible with the Comparative method, including glottochronology and mass lexical comparison. Most historical linguists consider these to be flawed and unreliable.\n\n\n"}

It suggests manipulation of consumer demand so potent that it has a coercive effect, amounts to a departure from free-market capitalism, and has an adverse effect on society in general. According to one source, the power of such 'manipulation' is not straightforward. It depends upon a new kind of individualism - \"projective individualism\", where persons use consumer capitalism to project the kind of person who they want to be. \n\nSome use the phrase as shorthand for the broader idea that the interests of other non-business entities (governments, religions, the military, educational institutions) are intertwined with corporate business interests, and that those entities also participate in the management of social expectations through mass media.\n\nThe origins of consumer capitalism are found in the development of American department stores from the mid 19th Century, notably the advertising and marketing innovations at Wanamaker's in Philadelphia. Author William Leach describes a deliberate, coordinated effort among American 'captains of industry' to detach consumer demand from 'needs' (which can be satisfied) to 'wants' (which may remain unsatisfied). This cultural shift represented by the department store is also explored in Émile Zola's 1883 novel \"Au Bonheur des Dames\", which describes the workings and the appeal of a fictionalized version of Le Bon Marché.\n\nIn 1919 Edward Bernays began his career as the 'father of public relations' and successfully applied the developing principles of psychology, sociology and motivational research to manipulate public opinion in favor of products like cigarettes, soap, and Calvin Coolidge. New techniques of mechanical reproduction developed in these decades improved the channels of mass-market communication and its manipulative power. This development was described as early as the 1920s by Walter Benjamin and related members of the Frankfurt School, who foresaw the commercial, societal and political implications.\n\nIn business history, the mid-1920s saw Alfred P. Sloan stimulating increased demand for General Motors products by instituting the annual model year change and planned obsolescence, a move that changed the dynamics of the largest industrial enterprise in the world, away from technological innovation and towards satisfying market expectations.\n\nProbably the most obvious example of consumer capital tactics in the United States' history occurred during the first world war. During which the United States' government put out several campaigns and advertisements aimed to gain support for engaging in the war. At this time the government's involvement in the economy was known as propaganda. Advertisements, posters and campaigns were found everywhere, encouraging the public to add to the economy and consume more. Many of these public attempts encouraged mass consumption of domestic food to help put back into the economy and support the war. and In her book, Celia Malone Kingsbury even discusses how during the war the government manipulated the economy in such a way that the consumption of domestic food was made into a \"powerful weapon.\" The government manipulated the public by turning commercialism into a sort of nationalism, pride and support of one's country.\n\nAn important contribution to the critique of consumer capitalism has been made by the French philosopher Bernard Stiegler, but very little of this has been translated into English. Stiegler argues that capitalism today is governed not by production but by consumption, and that the techniques used to create consumer behavior amount to the destruction of psychic and collective individuation. The diversion of libidinal energy toward the consumption of consumer products, he argues, results in an addictive cycle, leading to hyperconsumption, the exhaustion of desire, and the reign of symbolic misery.\n\nIn light of the economic hardships the United States is today experiencing as a result of radical wealth inequalities, and perhaps a strong dependence on oil, consumer capitalist tactics have turned to credit as a means to maintaining a high level of expenditures in the form of consumer demand. Some of these tactics, to cite one extremely peripheral example, include government incentives to buy eco-friendly 'green' products, such as tax deductions for energy conserving home improvements or the purchasing of hybrid cars. These tactics, however, are not without critics. James Gustave Speth, former dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and author of \"The Bridge at the Edge of the World: Capitalism, the Environment, and Crossing from Crisis to Sustainability,\" does not believe the United States government should implement such tactics. Instead Gustave believes in more direct approaches to repair or avoid environmental damage. Rather than focusing on re-boosting the distressed economy, treat the problem.\n\n"}

Examples of such techniques are actions that disturb the normal activities of society such as demonstrations, general strike action, riot, terrorism, civil disobedience, and even revolution or insurrection. Social movements often engage in contentious politics. The concept distinguishes these forms of contention from the everyday acts of resistance explored by James C. Scott, interstate warfare, and forms of contention employed entirely within institutional settings, such as elections or sports. Historical sociologist Charles Tilly defines contentious politics as \"interactions in which actors make claims bearing on someone else's interest, in which governments appear either as targets, initiators of claims, or third parties.\"\n\nContentious politics has existed forever, but its form varies over time and space. For example, Tilly argues that the nature of contentious politics changed fairly dramatically with the birth of social movements in 18th-century Europe. \n\nThe concept of contentious politics was developed throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century by its most prominent scholars in the United States: Sidney Tarrow, Charles Tilly, and Doug McAdam. Until its development, the study of contentious politics was divided among a number of traditions each of which were concerned with the description and explanation of different contentious political phenomena, especially the social movement, the strike, and revolution. One of the primary goals of these three authors was to advance the explanation of these phenomena and other contentious politics under a single research agenda. There remains a significant plurality of agendas in addition to the one these three propose.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1622957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1622957", "title": "Culture of Pakistan", "text": "Culture of Pakistan\n\nCulture of Pakistan ( ) is intertwined with the culture of the broader Indian subcontinent. Comprises numerous ethnic groups: the Punjabis, Saraikis, Pothwaris, Kashmiris, Sindhis, Muhajirs in east, Makrani in the south; Baloch, Hazaras and Pashtuns in the west; and the Dards, Wakhi, Baltis, Shinaki and Burusho communities in the north. The culture of these Pakistani ethnic groups have been greatly influenced by many of its neighbours, such as the other South Asian, Iranic, Turkic as well as the peoples of Central Asia and West Asia.\n\nThe region has formed a distinct unit within the main geographical complex of Indian subcontinent, West Asia the Middle East and Central Asia from the earliest times, and is analogous to the position of Afghanistan. There are differences among the ethnic groups in cultural aspects such as dress, food, and religion, especially where pre-Islamic customs differ from Islamic practices. Their cultural origins also reveal influences from far afield and indigenous, including ancient India and Central Asia. Pakistan was the first region of the Indian subcontinent to be fully impacted by Islam and has thus developed a distinct Islamic identity, historically different from areas further east.\n\nPakistani literature originates from when Pakistan gained its independence as a sovereign state in 1947. The common and shared tradition of Urdu literature and English literature of Greater India was inherited by the new state. Over a period of time, a body of literature unique to Pakistan emerged, written in nearly all major Pakistani languages, including Urdu, English, Punjabi, Pashto, Seraiki, Baloch, and Sindhi.\n\nPoetry is a highly respected art and profession in Pakistan. The pre-eminent form of poetry in Pakistan almost always originates in Persian, due in part to the long-standing affiliation and heavy admiration the region's rulers once had for certain aspects of foreign Persian culture. The enthusiasm for poetry exists at a regional level as well, with nearly all of Pakistan's provincial languages continuing the legacy. Since the independence of the country in 1947 and establishment of Urdu as the national language, poetry is written in that language as well. The Urdu language has a rich tradition of poetry and includes the famous poets Muhammad Iqbal (national poet), Mir Taqi Mir, Ghalib, Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Ahmad Faraz, Habib Jalib, Jazib Qureshi, and Ahmad Nadeem Qasmi. Apart from Urdu poetry, Pakistani poetry also has blends of other regional languages. Balochi, Sindhi, Punjabi, Seraiki, and Pashto poetry have all incorporated and influenced Pakistani poetry.\n\nThe variety of Pakistani music ranges from diverse provincial folk music and traditional styles such as Qawwali and Ghazal Gayaki to modern forms fusing traditional and Western music, such as the synchronisation of Qawwali and Western music by the world-renowned Sabri Brothers and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. In addition, Pakistan is home to many famous folk singers such as the late Alam Lohar, who is also well known in Indian Punjab. The arrival of Afghan refugees in the western provinces has rekindled Dari music and established Peshawar as a hub for Afghan musicians and a distribution center for Afghani music abroad.\n\nKathak\n-the classical dance that developed in the royal courts of the Mughals.\n\nFolk dances are still popular in Pakistan and vary according to the region such as:\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are very similar to stage plays in theatres. They are performed by well-known actors and actresses in the Lollywood industry. The dramas and plays often deal with themes from everyday life, often with a humorous touch.\n\nAbdul Rehman Chughtai, Sughra Rababi, Ustad Allah Baksh, Aboo B. Rana, Ajaz Anwar, Ismail Gulgee, Jamil Naqsh, and Sadequain are prominent and outstanding creative painters of Pakistan. Pakistani vehicle art is a popular folk art.\n\nThe architecture of the areas now constituting Pakistan can be traced to four distinct periods: pre-Islamic, Islamic, colonial, and post-colonial. With the beginning of the Indus civilization around the middle of the 3rd millennium B.C., an advanced urban culture developed for the first time in the region, with large structural facilities, some of which survive to this day. Mohenjo Daro, Harappa and Kot Diji belong to the pre-Islamic era settlements. The rise of Buddhism, Guptas, Mouryas, and the Persian and Greek influence led to the development of the Greco-Buddhist style, starting from the 1st century CE. The high point of this era was reached with the culmination of the Gandhara style. An example of Buddhist architecture is the ruins of the Buddhist monastery Takht-i-Bahi in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nThe arrival of Islam in today's Pakistan introduced the classical Islamic construction techniques into Pakistan's architectural landscape. However, a smooth transition to predominantly picture-less Islamic architecture occurred. The town of Uch Sharif contains the tombs of Bibi Jawindi, Baha'is-Halim, and Jalaluddin Bukhari, which are considered some of the earliest examples of Islamic architecture in Pakistan and are on the UNESCO Tentative World Heritage Site list since 2004. One of the most important of the few examples of the Persian style of architecture is the tomb of the Shah Rukn-i-Alam in Multan. During the Mughal era, design elements of Islamic-Persian architecture were fused with, and often produced playful forms of, local art, resulting in the establishment of Mughal Architecture. Lahore, occasional residence of Mughal rulers, exhibits a multiplicity of important buildings from the empire, among them the Badshahi mosque, the fortress of Lahore with the famous Alamgiri Gate, the colourful, still strongly Mughal-influenced Wazir Khan Mosque as well as numerous other mosques and mausoleums. The Shahjahan Mosque of Thatta in Sindh also originates from the epoch of the Mughals, as does the Mohabbat Khan Mosque in Peshawar.\n\nIn the British colonial age, the buildings developed were predominantly of the Indo-European style, with a mixture of European and Indian-Islamic components. Post-colonial national identity is expressed in modern structures like the Faisal Mosque, the Minar-e-Pakistan and the Mazar-e-Quaid.\n\nThe official national sport of Pakistan is field hockey, but cricket and squash are the most popular sports. The Pakistan national field hockey team has won the Hockey World Cup a record four times. The Pakistan national cricket team won the Cricket World Cup in 1992, were runners-up in 1999, and co-hosted the games in 1987 and 1996. Additionally, they have also won the ICC World Twenty20 in 2009 and were runners-up in 2007. The team has also won the Austral-Asia Cup in 1986, 1990, and 1994.\nIn 2017, Pakistan won the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy against their rival India. \n\nAt the international level, Pakistan has competed many times at the Summer Olympics in field hockey, boxing, athletics, swimming, and shooting. Hockey is the sport in which Pakistan has been most successful at the Olympics, winning three gold medals (1960, 1968, and 1984). Pakistan has also won the Hockey World Cup four times (1971, 1978, 1982, and 1994). Pakistan has hosted several international competitions, including the South Asian Federation Games in 1989 and 2004.\n\nA1 Grand Prix racing is also becoming popular with the entry of a Pakistani team in the 2005 season. The Tour de Pakistan, modeled on the Tour de France, is an annual cycling competition that covers the length and breadth of Pakistan. Recently, football has grown in popularity across the country, where traditionally it had been played almost exclusively in the western province of Balochistan. FIFA has recently teamed up with the government to bring football closer to the northern areas.\n\nCulinary art in Pakistan mainly a mix of Indian cuisines with some Middle Eastern and Afghan influence. There are variations of cooking practices across the country, mostly from spicy in Punjab and Sindh to steamed and boiled in NWFP(now otherwise known as the province of khyber pakhtoon khwa and gilgit baltistan) and Balochistan. Urban centers of the country offer an amalgamation of recipes from all parts of the country, while food with specific local ingredients and tastes is available in rural areas and villages. \nDifferent specialties exist throughout the country mostly different type of rice like Biryani, Pulao or Boiled rice with vegetables and meat are used with Korma and desserts. There are also local forms of grilled meat or kebabs, Kheer desserts, and a variety of hot and cold drinks.\nRamadan, the holiest month of the Islamic calendar, is a month of fasting from dawn to sunset. It is widely observed by Pakistan's Muslim majority. Muslims during this month will fast, attend mosques with increased frequency, and offer \"Namaz-traveeh\" every day with Isha prayer and recite Qur'an. Special foods are cooked in greater quantities, parties are held, and special accommodation is made by workplaces and educational institutes.\n\nChand Raat is the \"Moon night\" when crescent moon is sighted on last day of Islamic month of Ramadan and next day is Eid ul-Fitr. In the night known as Chand Raat, people celebrate by various means, such as girls putting henna on their hands. People buy gifts and sweets that will be given to friends and families who come over to celebrate the end of Ramadan. The streets, major buildings, and landmarks, even outside of malls and plazas, put on displays of elaborate decorations and colorful light shows. There are large crowds in the city center to celebrate the beginning of Eid, and it is usually a boom time for business.\n\nThe two Eids, Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Adha, commemorate the passing of the month of fasting, Ramadan, and the willingness of Ibrahim to sacrifice his son Ismael for Allah. On these days, there are national holidays and many festival events that take place to celebrate Eid.<As Pakistan is a Muslim state, there are three days off for all businesses and government offices.\n\nOn the night before Eid, people search for the new moon to mark the end of Ramadan and arrival of Eid ul-Fitr. The day starts with morning prayers, then returning home for a large breakfast with family members. The day is spent visiting relatives and friends and sharing gifts and sweets with everyone. During the evening, Pakistanis often party, visit restaurants or relax in city parks.\n\nOn Eid ul-Fitr, money is given for charity and as gifts to young children.\n\nOn Eid ul-Adha, people may also distribute meat to relatives and neighbors and donate food to charity.\n\nMilaad un Nabi is a known religious festival which is celebrated in all over Pakistan. The Milaad is the celebration of the birthday of the Islamic last prophet Muhammad.\n\nMuharram is a month of remembrance and modern Shia meditation that is often considered synonymous with Ashura. Ashura, which literally means the \"Tenth\" in Arabic, refers to the tenth day of Muharram. It is well-known because of historical significance and mourning for the martyrdom of Hussein Ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad\n\nShias begin mourning from the first night of Muharram and continue for ten nights, climaxing on the 10th of Muharram, known as the Day of Ashura. The last few days up until and including the Day of Ashura are the most important because these were the days in which Imam Hussein and his family and followers (including women, children, and elderly people) were deprived of water from the 7th onward and on the 10th, Imam Hussain and 72 of his followers were martyred by the army of Yazid I at the Battle of Karbala on Yazid's orders. The surviving members of Imam Hussein's family and those of his followers were taken captive, marched to Damascus, and imprisoned there.\n\nWith the sighting of the new moon, the Islamic New Year is ushered in. The first month, Muharram is one of the four sacred months that [Allah] has mentioned in the Quran.\n\nJashn-e-Baharan sometimes referred to as \"Basant\", is a pre-Islamic Punjabi festival that marks the coming of spring. Celebrations in Pakistan are centered in Lahore, and people from all over the country and abroad come to the city for the annual festivities. Kite flying competitions took place all over the city's rooftops during Basant but are now prohibited. The fertile province of Punjab was intimately tied via its agriculture to the different seasons of the year. The arrival of spring was an important event for all farmers and was welcomed with a celebration, hence the name \"Jashn\" (celebration) \"Baharan\" (spring).\n\nOn 14th. August, the people of Pakistan celebrate the day when Pakistan gained its independence from British India and became an independent state for Muslims of South Asia. The day begins with gatherings and prayers in mosques all across Pakistan in which people pray for the betterment and success of their country. Early in the morning, a 21 cannon salute is given to all those who contributed and lost their lives for attaining Independence. Flag hoisting ceremonies are held in the capital Islamabad and all capital cities of other provinces. Mega-events are organized all across the country, in which the people of Pakistan sing their national anthem and famous classical and pop singers sing various patriotic songs. Famous governmental and private buildings are decorated with lights and the day is concluded by a spectacular firework in Major cities of Pakistan.\n\nSeptember 6 is another patriotic day when the Army of Pakistan displays Pakistani weaponry to the general public. All government officials attend the ceremony and recognitions are awarded to special people for their work. In March 2007, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) displayed the new jointly manufactured Chinese-Pakistani aircraft called the JF-17 Thunder.\n\nTraditionally, the government-owned Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV) has been the dominant media player in Pakistan. The PTV channels are controlled by the government and opposition views are not given much time. The past decade has seen the emergence of several private TV channels showing news and entertainment, such as GEO TV, AAJ TV, ARY Digital, HUM, MTV Pakistan, and others. Traditionally the bulk of TV shows have been plays or soap operas, some of them critically acclaimed. Various American, European, Asian TV channels, and movies are available to a majority of the population via Cable TV. Television accounted for almost half of the advertising expenditure in Pakistan in 2002.\n\nThe Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) was formed on 14 August 1947, the day of Pakistani independence. It was a direct descendant of the Indian Broadcasting Company, which later became All India Radio. At independence, Pakistan had radio stations in Dhaka, Lahore, and Peshawar. A major programme of expansion saw new stations open at Karachi and Rawalpindi in 1948, and a new broadcasting house at Karachi in 1950. This was followed by new radio stations at Hyderabad (1951), Quetta (1956), the second station at Rawalpindi (1960), and a receiving center at Peshawar (1960). During the 1980s and 1990s, the corporation expanded its network to many cities and towns of Pakistan to provide greater service to the local people. Today, there are over a hundred radio stations due to more liberal media regulations.\n\nPakistan's movie industry is known as Lollywood, named after the city of Lahore. Film production centers also exist in Karachi and Peshawar. The Pakistani film industry produces over forty feature-length films a year. Bollywood films are also popular in Pakistan but with recent bad relations with India, they tend to be on the cinema screen much lesser than they used to do.\n\nThe national dress is shalwar kameez for both men and women. It consists of a long, loose fitting tunic with trousers baggy enough to not to see the shape of their legs.\n\n"}

It is a public entity set up under the terms of the National Heritage Resources Act. It is mandated to care for that part of South Africa's national estate that is of provincial and local significance in the Western Cape. It may delegate responsibility for heritage resources of local significance to competent municipal governments.\n\nHeritage Western Cape is best known as the custodian of approximately 2,500 provincial heritage sites, but is also responsible for administration of other forms of protection of heritage established under the terms of the National Heritage Resources Act.\n\nHeritage Western Cape is the successor body to the former National Monuments Council in the Western Cape. Under the 1996 Constitution of South Africa, cultural matters are a competency shared between national and provincial government. This necessitated the creation of a system whereby many of the responsibilities of the former National Monuments Council were devolved to provincial level via the National Heritage Resources Act.\n\nWhilst provinces may pass their own heritage conservation legislation, the Government of the Western Cape chose to use provisions of the National Heritage Resources Act which allow it to establish a provincial heritage resources authority (PHRA). Heritage Western Cape was hence established by regulation on 25 October 2002. In 2003 a Council was appointed by the province’s Minister for Cultural Affairs and Sport and has since met on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe Council has established a number of sub-committees which meet regularly to carry out the legal responsibilities of the organisation. For the most part this concerns the processing of almost 3 300 applications per annum for work on sites protected under the terms of the National Heritage Resources Act.\n\nHeritage Western Cape inherited responsibility for approximately 2,500 former national monuments, now known as \"provincial heritage sites\". The National Heritage Resources Act provides for a greater variety of protection than did its predecessor and the organisation has continued to institute protections of various forms under its terms. A large part of this work is dedicated to transforming the heritage landscape of the Western Cape to ensure that the heritage of all its people enjoys equal recognition and appropriate protection.\n\nThe logo of the organisation was launched by the provincial Minister for Cultural Affairs and Sport on 13 May 2006.\n\nHeritage Western Cape is subject to a biennial assessment of competency by the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA) in terms of which it is determined which aspects of the National Heritage Resources Act it is qualified to implement. It has been assessed as competent to deal with all areas over which a provincial heritage resources authority is permitted to act, aside from Section 36 of the Act which covers certain aspects relating to graves and burials.\n\nTo clarify areas of uncertainty regarding mandate, representatives of Heritage Western Cape meet quarterly with SAHRA. Following a court case that created uncertainty regarding responsibility for sites that have been recognised as Grade I by SAHRA, but which have not yet been declared as national heritage sites, a memorandum of understanding has been concluded which allows Heritage Western Cape to deal with all such matters unless they concern archaeological sites and graves protected under Sections 35 and 36 of the National Heritage Resources Act.\n\nHeritage Western Cape is responsible for sites that fall within the following categories:\n\n\nHeritage Western Cape is governed by a Council which is appointed by the province's Minister of Cultural Affairs and Sport. It consists of up to 14 members appointed for a three-year term of office. The Council meets quarterly and has established an Executive Committee to manage its business between its meetings. The Executive is chaired by the chairperson of the Council and is otherwise made up of the chairpersons of standing sub-committees.\n\nThe terms of office of the present Council and its sub-committees expire on 31 October 2019.\n\nThere are five standing sub-committees which oversee aspects of the day-to-day business of the organisation. They are made up of specialists who are recognised for their expertise and experience in the areas of business of the committees on which they serve.\n\nEstablished in 2003, it considers permit applications relating to structures and landscapes that are provincial heritage sites, provisionally protected, on the register of heritage resources, public monuments or memorials, or older than 60 years. Applications to work on such sites are assessed by the committee to consider whether or not they should be approved. The committee meets monthly.\n\nApplications to work on archaeological and palaeontological sites and meteorite permit applications in the province are considered by the APM Committee. It also considers applications concerning provincial heritage sites, provisionally protected sites and sites on the register of heritage resources that have been protected for their archaeological or palaeontological value. The Committee also advises the IACom regarding impact assessments on archaeological, palaeontological and meteorite resources. The committee meets monthly.\n\nEstablished in 2010 it is responsible for considering impact assessments that are submitted to Heritage Western Cape under the terms of the National Heritage Resources Act, the National Environment Management Act, or The Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act. The committee meets monthly.\n\nEstablished in 2003 this Committee deals with appeals made against decisions taken by the committees and staff of Heritage Western Cape. The committee meets monthly. (There is a further right of appeal to a tribunal established by the provincial Minister for Cultural Affairs and Sport.)\n\nThis committee was established in 2012 via amalgamation of three sub-committees. It considers and makes recommendations to the Council on grading of heritage resources; adoption of inventories of heritage resources submitted to Heritage Western Cape by municipalities and conservation bodies; formal protection of sites as provincial heritage sites or placement on the 'register' and texts for the interpretation of heritage sites. The committee meets quarterly.\n\n\n\nHeritage Western Cape is managed by a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who is assisted by a Deputy Director. It has the following Sections: Administrative Support, Professional Services (responsible for processing application) and Policy and Planning responsible for policy development, research and inventories). The latter two are made up of professional archaeologists, architects, historians and planners.\n\nIn terms of delegations from the Council the staff deal with areas of responsibility of the organisation not covered by the committees, mainly the processing of applications for minor work on heritage resources. The staff also provides support to and makes recommendations to the Council and its sub-committees.\n\nThere are approximately 2,500 provincial heritage sites in the Western Cape. Most of these were declared under legislation that predates the National Heritage Resources Act. Known as \"national monuments\" from 1969–2000 and \"historical monuments\" from 1934–1969, these sites are in the process of being graded in terms of the grading system prescribed by the Act and which determines whether they remain provincial heritage sites, are included in the register of heritage resources or no longer enjoy formal protection.\n\nIn its early years Heritage Western Cape did not declare any new Provincial Heritage Sites, but in recent years has resumed declaration and has since 2009 gazetted the following:\n\n\nInventories of the national estate consist of identified heritage resources situated within a particular geographical area and/or within a certain category (e.g.: built environment, archaeology, etc.) and must be submitted to Heritage Western Cape at the time of compiling or amending a municipal planning scheme.\n\nInventories of heritage resources for aspects of the national estate situated in the following municipalities have been submitted to Heritage Western Cape:\n\n\nThese inventories deal primarily with built environment in an urban context and are not complete inventories of the municipalities concerned.\n\nHeritage Western Cape receives an annual transfer payment from the Western Cape Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport which covers the bulk of its operational costs. Its staff members are public servants in the employ of the Department which carries the cost of their salaries and benefits. Other sources of income include fees levied from charges for processing of applications.\n\nHeritage Western Cape is required to register conservation bodies interested in the protection of the national estate in the province. It has registered 84 such organisations which are consulted on matters before the organisation.\n\n\n\n"}

The method works by creating a command signal that cancels its own vibration.

Input shaping is implemented by convolving a sequence of impulses, known as an input shaper, with any arbitrary command. The shaped command that results from the convolution is then used to drive the system. If the impulses in the shaper are chosen correctly, then the shaped command will excite less residual vibration than the unshaped command. The amplitudes and time locations of the impulses are obtained from the system's natural frequencies and damping ratios. Shaping can be made very robust to errors in the system parameters.\n\n"}
{"id": "16022654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16022654", "title": "Ireland Shakespeare forgeries", "text": "Ireland Shakespeare forgeries\n\nThe Ireland Shakespeare forgeries were a cause célèbre in 1790s London, when author and engraver Samuel Ireland announced the discovery of a treasure-trove of Shakespearean manuscripts by his son William Henry Ireland. Among them were the manuscripts of four plays, two of them previously unknown.\n\nUpon the release of the manuscripts, such respected literary figures as James Boswell (biographer of Samuel Johnson) and poet-laureate Henry James Pye pronounced them genuine, as did various antiquarian experts. Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the leading theatre manager of his day, agreed to present one of the newly discovered plays with John Philip Kemble in the starring rôle. Excitement over the biographical and literary significance of the find turned to acrimony, however, when it was charged that the documents were forgeries. Edmond Malone, widely regarded as the greatest Shakespeare scholar of his time, conclusively showed that the language, orthography, and handwriting were not those of the times and persons to which they were credited. William Henry Ireland, the supposed discoverer, then confessed to the fraud.\n\nAlthough Shakespeare's works were readily available in versions both for the learned and for the general public, no satisfactory biography could be constructed. In spite of an intense search by would-be Shakespeare biographers from Nicholas Rowe to Edmond Malone, only scraps and legends turned up. There was an intense hope and expectation that some documents would surface to fill the gap.\n\nSamuel Ireland was an eager collector of antique relics—his collection included a piece of Charles II's cloak, Oliver Cromwell's leather jacket, and Joseph Addison's fruit knife—as well as a Shakespeare enthusiast. While gathering material for a forthcoming book, \"Picturesque Tours of the Upper, or Warwickshire Avon\", he passed through Stratford on Avon, Shakespeare's birthplace, by then already capitalising on this claim to fame, and made inquiries about the life of the dramatist. Although he had the satisfaction of being the first to introduce Shakespeare's crabtree and Anne Hathaway's cottage to the general public, Shakespeare documents eluded him.\n\nHis son William Henry Ireland had a fascination with forgery. He was heavily influenced by the novel \"Love and Madness\" by Herbert Croft which contained lengthy passages on the forger Thomas Chatterton. William witnessed his father's frustration first-hand. One moment, in particular, struck him forcibly. Knowing that the furniture and papers from New Place, Shakespeare's last residence, had been moved to Clopton house when New Place was demolished, Samuel Ireland reasoned that Shakespearean manuscripts might well be found there. Upon visiting however, he was informed by the current tenant that all the old papers—many of them Shakespeare's—had recently been burned. Samuel Ireland's distress at this news made a strong impression on the young man—even though it later turned out that this story was a nothing more than a joke at Ireland's expense. According to the younger Ireland's confessions, it was to please his father that he embarked on the career of literary forgery that would ultimately ruin them both.\n\nFrom a chance acquaintance met at a book-binder's the young man learned of a technique for simulating the appearance of ancient writing by using a special ink and then heating the paper. After a trial run creating a couple of relatively insignificant documents, he set out to devise something with Shakespeare's signature. His work at a legal firm gave him access to Elizabethan and Jacobean parchment deeds, so in December 1794 he cut a piece of parchment from one of them, used his special ink to write with and heated it over a candle. The result was a mortgage deed between Shakespeare and his fellow-actor John Heminges on one side, and Michael Fraser and his wife on the other. The text and signature he copied from the facsimile of the genuine 1612 mortgage deed printed in Malone's edition of Shakespeare. Ripping a seal from another early deed, young Ireland attached it to this concoction and presented the result to his father on 16 December. Samuel Ireland accepted it as authentic, and the next day took it to the Heralds' Office, which approved it as genuine.\n\nAsked where he had turned up this deed, William Henry replied that he had found it in an old trunk belonging to a chance acquaintance who did not wish to have his name revealed. Mr. H., as he called him, had freely given him this deed. The young discoverer suggested that there might well be more documents where this had come from, and quickly followed this up with a promissory note from Shakespeare to Heminges—the only such note (had it been genuine) ever discovered from the period.\n\nWith his next discovery William Henry moved from mere forgery to original art. Having learned—apparently from a chance remark by one of his father's friends rather than by research—that Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton had been Shakespeare's patron, he decided to create correspondence between them. \"Doe notte esteeme me a sluggarde nor tardye for thus havyinge delayed to answerre or rather toe thank you for youre greate Bountye,\" he has Shakespeare write sans punctuation. \"[G]ratitude is alle I have toe utter and that is tooe greate ande tooe sublyme a feeling for poore mortalls toe expresse O my Lord itte is a Budde which Bllossommes Bllooms butte never dyes.\" The Earl of Southampton replies in a similar vein, also sans punctuation, and with a similar spelling: “…as I have beene thye Freynde soe will I continue aughte thatte I canne doe forre thee praye commande me ande you shalle fynde mee Yours Southampton”. To explain how both letters could end up together in the same collection William Henry added a note explaining that Shakespeare’s was a “Copye” of the letter he sent. Samuel Ireland and his friends admired the style of the letters but not the earl’s penmanship; William Henry, not knowing that handwriting of the earl was extant, had written Southampton’s reply with his left hand.\n\nA flood of documents now followed, all coming from Mr. H’s ostensibly-miraculous chest. Shakespeare’s “Profession of Faith” proved he was a Protestant, a letter to fellow-actor Richard Cowley showed he was \"a perfect good natured man\", and a letter from Queen Elizabeth made it clear that he was favoured by the most powerful person in the land. A sketch of himself that accompanied his letter to Cowley showed that he was a wretched draftsman with an impenetrable sense of humour. Described in the letter as a \"whysycalle conceyte\", it was (as Malone put it) \"most truly whimsical, being a miserable drawing of our poet done by himself with a pen, from Martin Droeshout's print of him engraved seven years after his death….\" There were also theatrical receipts, contracts, a letter and poem to his future wife, \"Anna Hatherrewaye\", and even books from Shakespeare's library, complete with marginal annotations actually signed by the bard himself. Of most interest, however, were a manuscript of \"King Lear\" Shakespeare had prepared for the press, a few stray leaves of \"Hamblette\", and two previously unknown plays, \"Vortigern and Rowena\" and \"Henry II\".\n\nFrom the moment of discovery Samuel Ireland invited friends in to see his new possessions. On 20 December 1794 Sir Frederick Eden came to examine the seal on the Fraser lease. He announced that it represented a quintain, a device used in lance practice, and the conclusion was that Shakespeare had used it as a play on his own name. In February 1795 however he issued a general invitation to literary men to come to his house and examine them. The exhibition was a roaring success. Samuel Parr and Joseph Warton on hearing Samuel Ireland read the \"Profession of Faith\" proclaimed it superior to anything in the English liturgy. James Boswell got down on his knees to kiss the relics. Scottish antiquarian George Chalmers and educator Richard Valpy visited frequently, and editor James Boaden, author Herbert Croft, and poet-laureate Henry James Pye (among others) testified publicly to their belief in the authenticity of the papers.\n\nOne hitch developed when an alert visitor noted that a document supposedly written by the Earl of Leicester was dated 1590, whereas the nobleman had died in 1588. When Samuel Ireland confronted his son with this information, William Henry wanted to burn the document, but his father demurred. He suggested that the document might have been misdated at some later time, and the two agreed to tear off the date. The item was displayed, and subsequently printed, in this mutilated form. At least two scholars, antiquary Joseph Ritson and classicist Richard Porson, correctly recognised the documents as forgeries, and editor Henry Bate Dudley started lampooning the papers as early as 17 February 1795.\n\nAs Samuel Ireland did not invite the two greatest Shakespeare scholars of the day, Edmond Malone and George Steevens, to examine the manuscripts, suspicion was aroused. As one writer noted \"The publick would certainly have been gratified to know, that these extraordinary MSS. had been deemed genuine by Dr. Farmer, Messrs. Stevens or Malone; whose literary characters might have served as letters of credence.\" Samuel Ireland later observed that he was \"of a different sentiment with regard to the sanction, which his [Malone's] inspection would afford them.\" He did however attempt to get Richard Farmer to look at the papers without success.\n\nThe exhibition, which roused much public excitement, continued for more than a year. On 17 November Ireland and his son carried the papers to St. James's Palace, where the Duke of Clarence and Mrs. Jordan examined them, and on 30 December Ireland submitted them to the Prince of Wales at Carlton House.\n\nAs early as 26 December 1794 William Henry had announced the existence of Shakespeare's unknown play \"Vortigern and Rowena\", but it was not until March that he was able to present his father with the manuscript. It came with Shakespeare's correspondence with a printer purporting to explain why the play was unpublished. Both Richard Brinsley Sheridan of Drury Lane Theatre and Thomas Harris of Covent Garden expressed an interest in producing the play. Sheridan was the winner in this competition. Prompted by fears that a descendant of Shakespeare might surface to claim the rights to his productions, William Henry produced a deed to prove that one of his ancestors, coincidentally named William Henry Ireland, had saved Shakespeare from drowning, and that Shakespeare had rewarded him with all the newly discovered manuscripts.\n\nSamuel Ireland announced the publication of the papers on 4 March 1795, and the volume itself appeared in December of that year. William Henry had bitterly opposed this move, but his father was determined. Included were such items as the \"Profession of Faith,\" the letter from Queen Elizabeth, and the manuscript of \"King Lear\". \"Henry II\", \"Vortigern\", and the marginalia were excluded from this volume.\n\nShortly after the appearance of the book Samuel Ireland's neighbour, Albany Wallis, who had discovered one of the few authentic signatures of Shakespeare, came up with a new and startling discovery. He had turned up a genuine John Heminges signature, and of course it looked nothing like the signatures William Henry had produced. When the forger learned of this problem, however, he soon produced Heminges signatures that resembled the authentic one. It seems, William Henry explained, that there were \"two\" actors named John Heminges active at the time—hence the dissimilar signatures.\n\nThe volume was not well received. The first reply was James Boaden's \"A Letter to George Steevens\" (16 January 1796). Boaden concentrated on the manuscript of \"Lear\", observing that if this is Shakespeare's original, and the printed versions contaminated with alterations by the actors, then the players are \"at once converted ... into the most elaborate and polished masters of versification, and Shakspeare into a writer without the necessary ear for rhythm—a man who produced a series of harmonious versification by chance, and lost the supreme ascendancy in his art, from the not being able to number ten syllables upon his fingers.\" He also took aim at the spelling. Samuel Ireland's friends and supporters raced in with replies. Colonel Francis Webb, writing under the name \"Philalethes,\" argued that as the paper was old the documents must have belonged to Shakespeare's time; there would have been no reason to forge them then; therefore they must be genuine. Matthew Wyatt took potshots at Boaden by contrasting his views as a believer with those after his conversion. Walley Chamberlain Oulton maintained that the papers were so voluminous that forgery was out of the question. He expressed a hope that \"Vortigern\" would turn out to be genuine, as it might well revitalise contemporary drama. He looked to the judgment of the audience for the play's vindication.\n\nTwo crushing blows came quickly. The first was the publication of Malone's volume of over four hundred pages on 31 March 1796. Exposing the forgeries in detail, he showed one by one that each document was flawed in its handwriting, its language, its orthography, and its history. The spelling of the documents was not only not that of Shakespeare's time, it was that of no time whatsoever. Numerous historical inaccuracies—not least of which was the reference to the Globe before that playhouse had been built—exposed the forger's ignorance. The handwriting of the Queen and Southampton did not at all resemble authentic examples. Words appearing in the forgeries (\"upset\", for example) were not used in Shakespeare's time, or were used in a different sense than that of the papers.\n\nThe second blow came two days later, on 2 April, with the failure of \"Vortigern\" at Drury Lane Theatre. The excitement was intense and the crowd volatile; tickets had sold out early and seats were hard come by. While at first the play seemed to be a success with the audience, soon fits of laughter were heard and at one point the play came to a complete halt till order was restored. When Barrymore announced another performance of the play, the audience rebelled, and chaos reigned until the management substituted something else. William Henry Ireland blamed the actors, particularly Kemble, along with a \"Malone faction,\" for the failure of his play. Others attributed it to the quality of the play itself. \"Vortigern's\" opening night was also its final performance.\n\nFor the Irelands, father and son, the failure of the play, coupled with Malone's exposure of the hoax, was an unmitigated disaster. Samuel Ireland still believed the papers to be Shakespeare's, and refused to listen to anything his son had to say. William Henry confessed the forgery to his sisters, to his mother, and to Albany Wallis, but his father did not believe his story. The public, not surprisingly, accused Samuel Ireland of the fraud. Sales of his books suffered.\n\nBlaming Malone for his misfortunes, Samuel Ireland set out to write a book that would destroy the scholar's reputation. With the aid of Thomas Caldecott he attacked Malone for using forensic techniques like handwriting comparison to settle a literary question, rather than relying on taste and aesthetic sensibilities. Concerned for his father's reputation William Henry rushed into print with a pamphlet confessing to the forgeries, and his father replied immediately with a vindication of his conduct in the whole affair. This combination roused suspicions. George Steevens accused the two of collusion:The hopeful youth takes on himself the guilt of the entire forgery, and strains hard to exculpate his worthy father from the slightest participation in it. The father, on the contrary, declares that his son had not sufficient abilities for the execution of so difficult a task. Between them, in short, there is a pretended quarrel, that they may not look as if they were acting in concert on the present occasion.The charge would stick. George Chalmers' \"Apology for the Believers\" and Samuel Ireland's \"Investigation\" concentrated on attacking Malone rather than exonerating Samuel, and the public verdict was probably summed up in a print by John Nixon depicting the entire Ireland family engaged in forging the papers.\n\nThe culpability of Samuel Ireland remained a controversial topic for years to come. Although his son's \"Confessions\" (1805) did a great deal to establish his innocence, not everybody was convinced. Accounts by Clement Mansfield Ingleby in 1859 and George Dawson in 1888 took the position that the father was responsible for the forgeries and the son's \"Confession\" was a tissue of lies. The acquisition of Samuel Ireland's papers by the British Museum in 1876, however, provided a wealth of evidence that Samuel was the victim rather than the perpetrator of the fraud, and Ingleby changed his position in his 1881 paper on the Ireland Affair.\n\nAfter Samuel Ireland's death in 1800, the original forgeries, bound in three folio volumes, were sold to John \"Dog\" Dent, MP and bibliophile. The collections passed through several hands before being acquired by Mary Morley Crapo Hyde (1912—2003) and her first husband, Donald Hyde (1909—1966). She left the volumes to Harvard's Houghton Library after her death.\n\nBritish writer Peter Ackroyd provides an imaginative account of the Ireland's forgeries in his novel \"The Lambs of London\" published by Chatto & Windus in 2004. In the same year, BBC Radio 4 broadcast Martyn Wade's play about the forgeries, \"Another Shakespeare\".\n\nImages of forged signatures and notes of William Shakespeare in \"The courtier of Counte Baldessar Castilio Diuided into foure bookes.

An example is Robin Williams' character in \"Mrs. Doubtfire\", a father who has fun with his children but is a poor disciplinarian and is seen by his wife as an irresponsible head of the household.\n\nIn the past, psychology recognized the concept of \"puer aeternus\", or \"eternal boy\".

It is derived from the traditional archetypal \"eternal boy\", Peter Pan.\n\nOne of the most well-known and extreme cases of Peter Pan syndrome and the kidult mentality is Michael Jackson. Michael explicitly stated that he did not want to grow up and he owned an impressive collection of arcade video games, toy cars and fantasy and sci-fi memorabilia.\n\nIn the early 21st century, there was reporting that for an adult to have interests traditionally expected only from children is not necessarily an anomaly.

Enormous successes of films such as \"Shrek\" and \"Harry Potter\", of books traditionally targeted for teenagers and the fact that Disneyland is among the world's top adult (without kids) vacation destinations seem to indicate that \"kidulthood\" is a rather mainstream phenomenon.

They were written mostly by Charles Burney. Others on the scientific basis of music were by John Farey Sr, and technical descriptions of some musical instruments were given by his son.\n\nIt had been Burney's intention to write a \"Dictionary of Music\", but for various reasons he never did so. In 1801 when he was aged 75 he was offered the chance of writing music articles in Rees's \"Cyclopaedia\", and this occupied him to around 1805 or '06. His fee was £1000. Burney's brief was to 'include definitions in all the languages of Europe where Music has been much cultivated, with its history, biography, Criticism and discussions'\n\nThe articles contain an enormous amount of musical information, much of which being augmented versions of what he had already published in his earlier writings In addition, he took the opportunity to add new topics covering the years of the last quarter of the eighteenth century and much of the first decade of the nineteenth, in particular the London musical scene. In all he wrote 996 general articles. While the majority of the articles have some length, a good proportion are brief (3 or 4 lines or fewer), dictionary definitions, or cross references. Many of the former are terms derived from French and Italian. The encyclopaedic-length articles (as distinct from the dictionary-length articles) are usually longer than Burney's earlier published writings on the same topic.\n\nDr Percy Scholes cites a statement by Dr Rees from Preface to the \"Cyclopaedia\" that he had 'constantly interpolated his own additions to the articles of his specialists'. and quotes a passage from the article about Dance (Vol 11) describing 'in our own memory', Welsh church-goers being played out of church by a fiddle.\n\nJohn Farey, sr was by profession a geologist, but was greatly interested music. He was involved with the Choral Fund, the Cecilian Society and the Surrey Chapel Society, and also sang in oratorios in Drury Lane Theatre. He was particularly interested in the mathematics of music and temperament, and wrote all the 215 scientific articles on these topics for Rees. Farey's investigations of temperament involved discussing (and criticising) the various schemes in use then. He described them in a series of letters to the \"Philosophical Magazine\", and the \"Monthly Magazine\" as well as the \"American Journal of Science\". He also contributed 25 articles to the \"Edinburgh Encyclopædia\" on this topic .\n\nJohn Farey, jr was a prolific contributor to Rees's \"Cyclopaedia\", not only as a writer but also as an artist of many of the plates. For the four articles he wrote, he drew plates for two illustrating John Isaac Hawkins's \"Finger-keyed Viol\", and two different patterns of pipe organ. The plates were keyed to the texts of the articles, and for this reason it was necessary for Farey to have produced both, since writing the texts describing the plates would have required technical knowledge which Burney would not have possessed.\n\nAlphabetisation of articles:<br>\nThe work followed the common practice of conflating the letters I and J and U and V into single sequences. The topics included in this list therefore follow the sequence they appear in the original volumes.\n\nAnnotations:<br>\nThe articles are annotated to Mercer's edition of Burney's \"History\" (1935) and Scholes's edition of Burney's travels, \"Travels\" (1959). Where a page reference is given the text can be found there. Where a book is cited, but with no page, index entries were found, and Burney is presumed to have written his article using the information there. Where there is no annotation, the article must be unique to the \"Cyclopaedia\".\n"}

Only older men can play it.\n\nLukho is played on a 2x8 mancala board (i.e., 2 rows of 8 pits each), with 48 seeds.\n\nA peculiarity of Lukho is the game setup. In the beginning, 3 seeds are placed in each pit. Then, players can remove as many seeds as they want from their own pits. After that, both players drop, at the same time, any number of the seeds they have removed from their own pits into a single opponent's pit. Still at the same time, they then sow those seeds following the same rules described below for subsequent sowings (captures included). Note that since players move concurrently, the outcome of this startup phase is quite unpredictable. The first player to complete his sowing will be the first one to play in the remainder of the game.\n\nAnother peculiar element of Lukho is that, once the opening move described above is done, all of the subsequent moves are set. In other words, the outcome of the game is decided by that single opening move described above. At his turn, the player must take all the seeds from the leftmost non-empty pit of his row, and relay-sow them counterclockwise. If the last seed is dropped in an empty pit of the player's row, and the opponent's opposite pit is non empty, then the seeds in that pit are captured, together with the capturing seed. If there is a continuous line of non empty pits after the one that has been captured, all the pits in that line are also captured.\n\nThere's one more rule that is similar to that of \"bulls\" in Maasai's Enkeshui, and that is the only rule that does not apply in the first move of the game. If the last seed of a sowing is dropped in a pit that contains exactly one seed, the turn is over and that pit becomes a \"knife\" belonging to the player who just moved. Seeds that are in a knife cannot be moved, and at end game they will be automatically captured by the player who owns the knife.\n\nWhen one of the players cannot move any more, the game is over. The player who captured most seeds wins the game.\n\nUsually, players will play several games (usually twelve, or multiples of twelve). Each game brings a score that is calculated as follows:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20021276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20021276", "title": "Mexican muralism", "text": "Mexican muralism\n\nMexican muralism was the promotion of mural painting starting in the 1920s, generally with social and political messages as part of efforts to reunify the country under the post Mexican Revolution government. It was headed by “the big three” painters, Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. From the 1920s to about 1970s a large number of murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created on public buildings, starting a tradition which continues to this day in Mexico and has had impact in other parts of the Americas, including the United States where it served as inspiration for the Chicano art movement.\n\nMexico has had a tradition of painting murals, starting with the Olmec civilization in the pre Hispanic period and into the colonial period, with murals mostly painted to evangelize and reinforce Christian doctrine. The modern tradition has its roots in the 19th century, with this use of political and social themes. The first Mexican mural painter to use philosophical themes in his work was Juan Cordero in the mid 19th century. Although he did mostly work with religious themes such as the cupola of the Santa Teresa Church and other churches, he painted a secular mural at the request of Gabino Barreda at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (since disappeared).\n\nThe latter 19th century was dominated politically by the Porfirio Díaz regime. This government was the first to push for the cultural development of the country, supporting the Academy of San Carlos and sending promising artists abroad to study. However, this effort left out indigenous culture and people, with the aim of making Mexico like Europe. Gerardo Murillo, also known as Dr. Atl, is considered to be the first modern Mexican muralists with the idea that Mexican art should reflect Mexican life. Academy training and the government had only promoted imitations of European art. Atl and other early muralists pressured the Diaz government to allow them to paint on building walls to escape this formalism. Atl also organized an independent exhibition of native Mexican artists promoting many indigenous and national themes along with color schemes that would later appear in mural painting. The first modern Mexican mural, painted by Atl, was a series of female nudes using “Atlcolor” a substance Atl invented himself, very shortly before the beginning of the Mexican Revolution . Another influence on the young artists of the late Porfirian period was the graphic work of José Guadalupe Posada, who mocked European styles and created cartoons with social and political criticism.\n\nThe Mexican Revolution itself was the culmination of political and social opposition to Porfirio Díaz policies. One important oppositional group was a small intellectual community that included Antonio Curo, Alfonso Reyes and José Vasconcelos. They promoted a populist philosophy that coincided with the social and political criticism of Atl and Posada and influenced the next generation of painters such as Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros.\n\nThese ideas gained power as a result of the Mexican Revolution, which overthrew the Díaz regime in less than a year. However, there was nearly a decade of fighting among the various factions vying for power. Governments changed frequently with a number of assassinations, including that of Francisco I. Madero who initiated the struggle. It ended in the early 1920s with one-party rule in the hands of the Álvaro Obregón faction, which became the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). During the Revolution, Atl supported the Carranza faction and promoted the work of Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros, who would later be the founders of the muralism movement. Through the war and until 1921, Atl continued to paint murals among other activities including teaching the Mexico’s next generation of artists and muralists.\n\nIn 1921, after the end of the military phase of the Revolution, José Vasconcelos was appointed to head the Secretaría de Educación Pública. At the time, most of the Mexican population was illiterate and the government needed a way to promote the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. It was Vasconcelos’s idea have a government-backed mural program for this purpose. Similar to mural use in the pre Hispanic period and during the colonial period, the purpose of these murals were not simply aesthetic, but social, to promote certain ideals. These ideals or principles were to glorify the Mexican Revolution and the identity of Mexico as a mestizo nation, with the indigenous promoted as well as the Spanish. The government began to hire the country’s best artists to paint murals, calling some of them home from Europe including Diego Rivera. These initial muralists included Dr. Atl, Ramón Alva de la Canal, Federico Cantú and others but the main three would be David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera. His time as secretary was short but it set how muralism would develop. His image was painted on a tempera mural in 1921 by Roberto Montenegro, but this was short lived. His successor at the Secretaría de Educación Pública ordered it painted out. The muralists differed in style and temperament, but all believed that art was for the education and betterment of the people. This was behind their acceptance of these commissions as well as their creation of the Syndicate of Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors. \nThe first government sponsored mural project was on the three levels of interior walls of the old Jesuit institution Colegio San Ildefonso, at that time used for the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria. However, most of the murals in the Escuela National Preparatoria were done by José Clemente Orozco with themes of a mestizo Mexico, the ideas of renovation and the tragedies of the Revolution; Fernando Leal painted [\"dancers of Chalma\"] \"Los danzantes de Chalma\", no earlier than 1922. Opposite that mural, Jean Charlot painted \"La conquista de Tenochtitlán\" (Conquest of Tenochtitlan) by Jean Charlot—invited by Leal. \n\nThis project at the institution was followed by projects at the Palacio Nacional, the interior walls of the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the Escuela Nacional de Chapingo the Escuela Nacional de Medicina and the Secretaria de Educación Pública building among many others.\n\nThe movement was strongest from the 1920s to the 1950s, which corresponded to the country’s transformation from a mostly rural and mostly illiterate society to an industrialized one. While today they are part of Mexico’s identity, at the time they were controversial, especially those with socialist messages plastered on centuries-old colonial buildings. One of the basic underpinnings of the nascence of a post revolutionary Mexican art was that it should be public, available to the citizenry and above all not the province of a few wealthy collectors. The great societal upheaval made the concept possible as well as a lack of relatively wealthy middle class to support the arts. On this, the painters and the government agreed. One other point of agreement was that artists should have complete freedom of expression. This would lead to another element added to the murals over their development. In addition to the original ideas of a reconstructed Mexico and the elevation of Mexico’s indigenous and rural identity, many of the muralists, including the three main painters, also included elements of Marxism, especially the struggle of the working class against oppression.\n\nThe inception and early years of Mexico's muralist movement are often considered the most ideologically pure and untainted by contradictions between socialist ideals and government manipulation. This initial phase is referred to as the \"heroic\" phase while the period after 1930 is the \"statist\" phase with the transition to the latter phase caused by José Vasconcelos's resignation in 1924. Scholar Mary Coffey describes those who \"acknowledge a change but refrain from judgment about its consequences\" as taking the soft line and those who see all murals after 1930 as \"propaganda for a corrupt state\" as taking a hard line. Another stance is that the evolution of Mexican muralism as having an uncomplicated relationship with the government and as an accurate reflection of avant-garde and proletariat sentiments. However, hard liners see the movement as complicit in the corrupt government's power consolidation under the guise of a socialist regime.\n\nArt historian Leonard Folgarait has a slightly different view. He marks 1940 as the end of the post-revolutionary period in Mexico as well as the renaissance era of the muralist movement. The conclusion of the Lázaro Cárdenas administration (1934 – 1940) and the beginning of the Manuel Avila Camacho (1940 – 1946) administration saw the rise of an ultraconservative Mexico. The country’s policy was aimed at maintaining and strengthening a capitalist society. Mural artists like the Big Three spent the post-revolutionary period developing their work based on the promises of a better future, and with the advent of conservatism they lost their subject and their voice.\n\nThe Mexican government began to distance itself from mural projects and mural production became relatively privatized. This privatization was a result of patronage from the growing national bourgeoisie. Murals were increasingly contracted for theaters, banks, and hotels.\n\nMexican populist art production from the 1920s to the 1950s is often grouped under the name of “Escuela Mexicana de Pintura (y Escultura) (Mexican School of Painting and Sculpture), coined in the 1930s by art historians and critics. The term is not well-defined as it does not distinguish among some important stylistic and thematic difference, there is no firm agreement which artists belong to it nor if muralism should be considered part of it or separate. It is not a school in the classic sense of the word as it includes work by more than one generation and with different styles that sometimes clash. However, it does involve a number of important characteristics. Mexican School mural painting was a combination of public ideals and artistic aesthetics “positioned as a constituent of the official public sphere.” Three formal components of official Mexican muralism are defined as:\n1) Direct participation in official publicity and discourse\n2) Reciprocal integration of the visual discourse of the mural to an array of communicative practices participant in defining official publicity (including a variety of scriptural genres, but also public speech, debate and provocative public “event”)\n3) The development and public thematizing of a social-realist aesthetic (albeit multiform in character) as the visual register for the public sense of the mural work and as the doxic, or unquestioned, limits for public dispute over the representational space of the mural image\nMost painters in this school worked in Mexico City or other cities in Mexico, working almost uninterrupted on projects and/or as teachers, generally with support of the government. Most were concerned with the history and identity of Mexico and politically active. Most art from this school was not created for direct sale but rather for diffusion in both Mexico and abroad. Most were formally trained, often studying in Europe and/or in the Academy of San Carlos. \n\nA large quantity of murals were produced in most of the country from the 1920s to 1970, generally with themes related to politics and nationalism focused often on the Mexican Revolution, mestizo identity and Mesoamerican cultural history. These served as a form of cohesion among members of the movement. The political and nationalistic aspects had little directly to do with the Mexican Revolution, especially in the later decades. The goal was more to glorify it and its results as a means to legitimatize the post Revolution government. The other political orientation was that of Marxism, especially class struggle. This was strongest in the early movement with Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros all avowed communists. The political messages became less radical but they remained firmly to the left. Much of the mural production glorified the indigenous aspect of Mexican culture, considering it an important factor in the creation of modern Mexico. This was added with the idea of reexamining the country’s history from a different perspective. One other aspect that most of the muralists shared was a rejection of the idea that art was only for the elite, but rather as a benefit for the masses.\n\nThe murals took on monumental status because of where they were situated, mostly on the walls of colonial era government buildings and the themes that were painted. The mural painters of Mexico freely shared ideas and techniques as they were a closely knit group. However, the work of each was distinctive as the government did not set style and artists can generally be deduced without looking at signatures. Techniques included the revival of old techniques such as the fresco, painting on freshly plastered walls and encaustic or hot wax painting . Others used mosaics and high fire ceramics, as well as metal parts, and layers of cement. The most innovative of the artists was Siqueiros who worked with pyroxlene, a commercial enamel and Duco (used to paint cars), resins, asbestos, old machinery and was one of the first to use airbrush for artistic purposes. He pored, sprayed, dripped and splattered paint for the effects they created haphazardly.\n\nBy far, the three most influential muralists from the 20th century are Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Siqueiros, called “los tres grandes” (the three great ones). All believed that art was the highest form of human expression and a key force in social revolution. Their work defined the movement taking over from Vasconcelos. It created a mythology around the Mexican Revolution and the Mexican people which is still influential to this day, as well as promote Marxist ideals. At the time the works were painted, they also served as a form of catharsis over what the country had endured during the war. However, the three were different in their artistic expression. Rivera’s works were utopian and idealist, Orozco’s were critical and pessimistic and the most radical were those of Siqueiros, heavily focused on a scientific future. The differences among the three have much to do with how each experienced the Mexican Revolution. Rivera was in Europe the entire time and did not fight. He never depicted the horrors of the war but what he perceived to be the social benefits from it. The other two did and both did express the horrors of war in their work. There was resentment to Rivera by the other two because of it, especially from Siqueiros.\n\nOf the three, Rivera was the most traditional in terms of painting styles, drawing heavily from European modernism. In his narrative mural images, Rivera incorporated elements of cubism His themes were Mexican, often scenes of everyday life and images of ancient Mexico. He originally painted this in bright colors in the European style but modified it to more earthy tones to imitate indigenous murals. His greatest contribution is the promotion of Mexico’s indigenous past into how many people both inside and outside of the country view it.\n\nOrozco also began with a European style of expression. However his art developed into an angry denunciation of oppression especially by those he considered to be an evil and brutal rules class. His work was somber and dire, with emphasis on human suffering and fear of the technology of the future. His work shows an \"expressionist use of color, slashing lines, and parodic distortions of the human figure.\" Like most other muralists, Orozco condemned the Spanish as destroyers of indigenous culture, but he did have kinder depictions such as that of a Franciscan friar tending to an emaciated indigenous period. Unlike other artists, Orozco never glorified the Mexican Revolution, having fought in it, but rather depicted the horrors of this war. It caused many of his murals to be heavily criticized and even defaced.\n\nSiqueiros was the youngest and most radical of the three. He joined the Venustiano Carranza army when he was eighteen and experienced the Revolution from the front lines. Although all three muralists were communists, Siqueiros was the most dedicated, as evidenced by his portrayals of the proletarian masses. His work is also characterized with rapid, sweeping, bold lines and the use of modern enamels, machinery and other elements related to technology. His style showed a \"futurist blurring of form and technique.\" His fascination with technology as it relates to art was exemplified when he emphasized the mass communications visual technology of photograph and motion picture in his eventual movement toward neorealism. His radical politics made him unwelcome in Mexico and the United States, so he did much of his work in South America. However, his masterpiece is considered to be the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros, located in Mexico City.\n\nThe Big Three struggled to express their leftist leanings after the initial years painting murals under government supervision. These struggles with the post-revolution government lead the muralists to create a union of artists and produce a radical manifesto. José Vasconcelos, the Secretary of Public Education under President Álvaro Obregón (1920–24) contracted Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco to pursue painting with the moral and financial support of the new post-revolutionary government. Vasconcelos, while seeking to promote nationalism and “raza cosmica,” seemed to contradict this sentiment as he guided the muralists to create works in a classic, European style. The murals became a target of Vasconcelos’s criticism when the Big Three departed from classical proportion and figure. Siqueiros was dissatisfied with the incongruity between the murals and the revolutionary concerns of the muralists, and he advocated discussion among the artists of their future works.\n\nIn 1922 the muralists founded the Union of Revolutionary Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors of Mexico. The Union then released a manifesto listing education, art of public utility, and beauty for all as the social goals of their future artistic endeavors.\n\nAfter nearly a century since the beginning of the movement, Mexican artists still produce murals and other forms of art with the same “mestizo” message. Murals can be found in government buildings, former churches and schools in nearly every part of the country. One recent example is a cross cultural project in 2009 to paint a mural in the municipal market of Teotitlán del Valle, a small town in the state of Oaxaca. High school and college students from Georgia, United States, collaborated with town authorities to design and paint a mural to promote nutrition, environmental protection, education and the preservation of Zapotec language and customs.\n\nMexican muralism brought mural painting back to the forefront of Western art in the 20th century with its influence spreading abroad, especially promoting the idea of mural painting as a form of promoting social and political ideas. It offered an alternative to non-representational abstraction after World War I with figurative works that reflect society and its immediate concerns. While most Mexican muralists had little desire to be part of the international art scene, their influence spread to other parts of the Americas. Notable muralists influenced by Mexican muralism include Carlos Mérida of Guatemala, Oswaldo Guayasamín of Ecuador and Candido Portinari of Brazil .\nRivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros all spent time in the United States. Orozco was the first to paint murals in the late 1920s at Pomona College in Claremont, California, staying until 1934 and becoming popular with academic institutions. During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration employed artists to paint murals, which paved the way for Mexican muralists to find commissions in the country. Rivera lived in the United States from 1930 to 1934. During this time, he put on an influential show of his easel work at the Museum of Modern Art. The success of Orozco and Rivera prompted U.S. artists to study in Mexico and opened doors for many other Mexican artists to find work in the country. Siqueiros did not fare as well. He was exiled to the US from Mexico in 1932, moving to Los Angeles. During this time, he painted three murals, but they were painted over. The only one of the three to survive, (full name: \"América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos\", or \"Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism\"), was restored by the Getty Conservation Institute and the América Tropical Interpretive Center opened to provide public access.\n\nThe concept of mural as political message was transplanted to the United States, especially in the former Mexican territory of the Southwest. It served as inspiration to the later Chicano muralism but the political messages are different. Revolutionary Nicaragua developed a tradition of muralism during the Sandinista period.\n\n\n\n"}

He described the five peculiarities of Arabic and claimed, all other languages of man, were derived from Arabic,\n\nHe explained, in the Arabic language, even the lonely alphabets (a, b, c etc.) at times manifest full and extensive meanings. e.g.:( see pp. 10–11)\n\nفِ (fi) 'Be faithful'\n\nقِ (qi) 'Keep an eye on'\n\nلِ (li) 'Come nearer'\n\nعِ ('I) 'Call to mind'\n\nاِ (I) 'Promise'\n\nخِ (Khe) 'Go, neither slowly nor fast, but with rather moderate pace'\n\nہِ (hi) 'Burst thyself, or become weak'\n\nدِ (di) 'Pay blood-money'\n\nرِ (ri) 'Flare up, become brighter, or come out of the fireplace.' or 'Become dirty'\n\nشِ (shi) 'Paint thy garments with patterns '\n\nنِ (ni) 'Be slow or lazy'\n\nAhmad goes on explaining, sometimes even small single words give extensive meanings: e.g.\n\nعرضتُ (\"araztu\") means: \"I have roamed about Makkah, Madina, and all the habitations around them.\"\n\nطہفلتُ (\"Tahfaltu\") means: \"I eat and have determined always to eat Millet bread .\"\n\nجثمَ (\"Jasama\") means: \"Half the night has passed\".\n\nحیعلَ (\"Haya-al\") means: \"Come; Pray! It is proper time.\"\n\n\"The Arabic language possesses excellent qualities and signs which, in the eyes of scholars, invest it with the status of a Mother in relation to\nother languages, and these languages are like a shadow in relation to Arabic or like sparrows in relation to a preying falcon.\" (page 100).\n\nAhmad believed that Arabic, being the First Language, however, in due course of time, great changes in the structure and form of the vocal apparatus, man's ecology and environment, and many other unknown factors, caused a diversification of Arabic language into thousands of tongues, all derived from Arabic. He writes, quoting from the Hebrew Torah, Genesis 11:1:-\n\nHe after commenting upon the relationship of Hebrew, or Sanskrit to Arabic, writes:\n\nAhmad highlighted \"Five\" points of the excellence of the Arabic language: [page. 17]\n\n1. Arabic has a complete organised structure of roots, that is to say, the roots meet fully all the needs of human beings in the field of expression ; the other languages are not so fitted.\n\n2. In Arabic, the names of the Divine Being, the names of the principal constituent parts of the universe, of plants, animals and minerals and of the members of the human body, possess, in the why and wherefore of their contents, deep philosophy and learning.\n\n3. The Additions and the roots of Arabic words are perfectly organised. The scope of this organisation, by linking into one philosophical chain, all the verbs and nouns, belonging to the same root, points out their interrelationships. This is not to be found, to this degree of excellence, in other languages.\n\n4. In Arabic expressions, words are few but meanings are many, that is to say, the Arabic language makes use of (ا) [alif], and (ل) [laam] and nunnation (تنوین) and the sequence of words, in such a way that to express the same meaning the other languages need a number of sentences to be linked up for the same purpose.\n\n5. Arabic possesses roots and expressions which are the perfect means of portraying the most delicate and deep things of the mind and human ideas.\n\nA greater part of the book is devoted to manifest these characteristic in further details. He writes, \" Thousands of languages\nare stricken with the calamity of a drawback that instead of root-words they make use of complex grammatical constructions, which shows that at a time of need such constructions have been invented by man.\" [page. 22]\n\nAfter the above \"Introductory details\", the rest of the treatise is in a very lucid and elegant Arabic.[page 27-127]\nHe explains that Arabic is unique to follow the patterns we observe in Nature. Two distinct features, i.e.'the pre-existing' Grace of God, like the bounties of Nature, the qualities inherent in the soil and earth, the sun and the changing weathers etc. And the second aspect being human efforts, labour and endeavours, these combine to give birth to the fruit of human endeavours. To fulfil these \"Two\" requirements, Arabic has \"Two\" distinct words for \"Mercy\", \"Rahman\" [رحمان]and \"Raheem\". [رحیم].\nTo explain his point, Ahmad writes:\n\nAhmad believed that Arabic was the Language of Divine Realization and designed to fulfill the Physical and Spiritual needs of man. He classified the Arabic Root-Words, into ten categories, calling them as the \"Ten Circles of Roots\". He describes them as follows: (pp: 38-40)\n\nHow did language come into being? To quote Encyclopædia Britannica: \" On the ultimate origin of language speculation has been rife, more, however, among philosophers than among philologists, who have very often been too matter-of-fact to take an interest in this problem. Some scholars (among them quite recently W. Schmidt) see the insufficiency of the usual theories, and giving up all attempts at explaining it in a natural way fall back on the religious belief that the first language was directly given to the first men by God through a miracle.\" \n\nA renowned Philologist Sheikh Muhammad Ahmad Mazhar (1896-1993) has contributed immensely to the work of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and studied the various languages (around 35) and traced them to their Arabic Root-Words.

{"id": "307372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307372", "title": "Mīmāṃsā", "text": "Mīmāṃsā\n\nMīmāṃsā is a Sanskrit word that means \"reflection\" or \"critical investigation\" and thus refers to a tradition of brahminical thought which reflected on the meanings of certain Vedic texts. This tradition is also known as Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā because of its focus on the earlier (\"pūrva\") Vedic texts dealing with ritual actions, and similarly as Karma-Mīmāṃsā due to its focus on ritual action (\"karma\"). It is one of six Vedic \"affirming\" (āstika) schools of Hinduism. This particular school is known for its philosophical theories on the nature of dharma, based on hermeneutics of the Vedas, especially the Brāḥmanas and Saṃhitas. The Mīmāṃsā school was foundational and influential for the vedāntic schools, which were also known as Uttara-Mīmāṃsā for their focus on the \"later\" (\"uttara\") portions of the Vedas, the Upaniṣads. While both \"earlier\" and \"later\" Mīmāṃsā investigate the aim of human action, they do so with different attitudes towards the necessity of ritual praxis.\n\nMīmāṃsā has several sub-schools, each defined by its epistemology. The Prābhākara sub-school, which takes its name from the seventh-century philosopher Prabhākara, described the five epistemically reliable means to gaining knowledge: \"pratyakṣa\" or perception; \"anumāna\" or inference; \"upamāṇa\", by comparison and analogy; \"arthāpatti\", the use of postulation and derivation from circumstances; and \"śabda\", the word or testimony of past or present reliable experts. The Bhāṭṭa sub-school, from philosopher Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, added a sixth means to its canon; \"anupalabdhi\" meant non-perception, or proof by the absence of cognition (e.g., the \"lack\" of gunpowder on a suspect's hand)\n\nThe school of Mīmāṃsā consists of both atheistic and theistic doctrines, but the school showed little interest in systematic examination of the existence of Gods. Rather, it held that the soul is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active spiritual essence, and focused on the epistemology and metaphysics of \"dharma\". For the Mīmāṃsā school, \"dharma\" meant rituals and social duties, not \"devas\", or gods, because gods existed only in name. The Mīmāṃsakas also held that Vedas are \"eternal, author-less, [and] infallible\", that Vedic \"vidhi\", or injunctions and mantras in rituals are prescriptive \"kārya\" or actions, and the rituals are of primary importance and merit. They considered the Upaniṣads and other texts related to self-knowledge and spirituality as subsidiary, a philosophical view that Vedānta disagreed with.\n\nMīmāṃsā gave rise to the study of philology and the philosophy of language. While their deep analysis of language and linguistics influenced other schools of Hinduism, their views were not shared by others. Mīmāṃsakas considered the purpose and power of language was to clearly \"prescribe\" the proper, correct and right. In contrast, Vedāntins extended the scope and value of language as a tool to also \"describe\", \"develop\" and \"derive\". Mīmāṃsakas considered orderly, law driven, procedural life as central purpose and noblest necessity of dharma and society, and divine (theistic) sustenance means to that end.\n\nThe Mīmāṃsā school is a form of philosophical realism. A key text of the Mīmāṃsā school is the Mīmāṃsā Sūtra of Jaimini.\n\nMīmāṃsā, also romanized Mimansa or Mimamsa, means \"reflection, consideration, profound thought, investigation, examination, discussion\" in Sanskrit. It also refers to the \"examination of the Vedic text\" and to a school of Hindu philosophy that is also known as (\"prior\" inquiry, also ), in contrast to (\"posterior\" inquiry, also ) – the opposing school of Vedanta. This division is based on classification of the Vedic texts into ', the early sections of the Veda treating of mantras and rituals (Samhitas and Brahmanas), and the ' dealing with the meditation, reflection and knowledge of Self, Oneness, Brahman (the Upaniṣads). Between the \"Samhitas\" and \"Brahmanas\", the Mīmāṃsā school places greater emphasis to the Brahmanas - the part of Vedas that is a commentary on Vedic rituals.\n\nDonald Davis translates Mīmāṃsā as the \"desire to think\", and in colloquial historical context as \"how to think and interpret things\". In the last centuries of the first millennium BCE, the word Mīmāṃsā began to denote the thoughts on and interpretation of the Vedas, first as \"Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā\" for rituals portions in the earlier layers of texts in the Vedas, and as \"Uttara-Mīmāṃsā\" for the philosophical portions in the last layers. Over time, Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā was just known as the Mīmāṃsā school, and the Uttara-Mīmāṃsā as the Vedanta school.\n\nMīmāṃsā scholars are referred to as \"Mīmāṃsāka\"s.\n\nMīmānsā is one of the six classical Hindu \"darśanas\". It is among the earliest schools of Hindu philosophies. It has attracted relatively less scholarly study, although its theories and particularly its questions on exegesis and theology have been highly influential on all classical Indian philosophies. Its analysis of language has been of central importance to the legal literature of India.\n\nAncient Mīmānsā's central concern was epistemology (\"pramana\"), that is what are the reliable means to knowledge. It debated not only \"how does man ever learn or know, whatever he knows\", but also whether the nature of all knowledge is inherently circular, whether those such as foundationalists who critique the validity of any \"justified beliefs\" and knowledge system make flawed presumptions of the very premises they critique, and how to correctly interpret and avoid incorrectly interpreting dharma texts such as the Vedas. It asked questions such as \"what is \"devata\" (god)?\", \"are rituals dedicated to \"devatas\" efficacious?\", \"what makes anything efficacious?\", and \"can it be proved that the Vedas, or any canonical text in any system of thought, fallible or infallible (\"svatah pramanya\", intrinsically valid)?, if so, how?\" and others. To Mīmānsā scholars, the nature of non-empirical knowledge and human means to it are such that one can never demonstrate certainty, one can only falsify knowledge claims, in some cases. According to Francis Clooney, a professor at Harvard Divinity School specializing on Hinduism, the Mīmānsā school is \"one of the most distinctively Hindu forms of thinking; it is without real parallel elsewhere in the world\".\n\nThe central text of the Mīmānsā school is Jamini's \"Mīmānsā Sutras\", along with the historically influential commentaries on this sutra by Sabara and by Kumarila Bhatta. Together, these texts develop and apply the rules of language analysis (such as the rules of contradiction), asserting that one must not only examine injunctive propositions in any scripture, but also examine the alternate related or reverse propositions for better understanding. They suggested that to reach correct and valid knowledge it is not only sufficient to demand proof of a proposition, it is important to give proof of a proposition's negative as well as declare and prove one's own preferred propositions. Further, they asserted that whenever perception is not the means of direct proof and knowledge, one cannot prove such non-empirical propositions to be \"true or not true\", rather one can only prove a non-empirical proposition is \"false, not false, or uncertain\".\n\nFor example, Mīmānsākas welcome not only the demand for proof of an injunctive proposition such as \"agnihotra ritual leads one to heaven\", but suggest that one must examine and prove alternate propositions such as \"ritual does not lead one to heaven\", \"something else leads one to heaven\", \"there is heaven\", \"there is no heaven\" and so on. Mīmānsā literature states that if satisfactory, verifiable proof for all of such propositions cannot be found by its proponents and its opponents, then the proposition needs to be accepted as a part of a \"belief system\". Beliefs, such as those in the scriptures (Vedas), must be accepted to be true unless its opponents can demonstrate the proof of validity of their own texts or teacher(s) these opponents presume to be \"prima facie justified\", and until these opponents can demonstrate that the scriptures they challenge are false. If they do not try to do so, it is hypocrisy; if they try to do so, it can only lead to infinite regress, according to Mīmānsākas. Any historic scripture with widespread social acceptance, according to Mīmānsāka, is an activity of communication (\"vyavaharapravrtti\") and is accepted as authoritative because it is socially validated practice, unless perceptually verifiable evidence emerges that proves parts or all of it as false or harmful.\n\nMīmānsākas were predominantly concerned with the central motivation of human beings, the highest good, and actions that make this possible. They stated that human beings seek \"niratisaya priti\" (unending ecstatic pleasure, joy, happiness) in this life and the next. They argued that this highest good is the result of one's own ethical actions (\"dharma\"), that such actions are what the Vedic sentences contain and communicate, and therefore it important to properly interpret and understand Vedic sentences, words and meaning. Mīmānsā scholarship was centrally concerned with the philosophy of language, how human beings learn and communicate with each other and across generations with language in order to act in a manner that enables them to achieve that which motivates them. The Mīmānsā school focussed on \"dharma\", deriving ethics and activity from the \"karma-kanda\" (rituals) part of the Vedas, with the argument that ethics for this life and efficacious action for \"svarga\" (heaven) cannot be derived from sense-perception, and can only be derived from experience, reflection and understanding of past teachings.\n<poem>\nIn every human activity, the motivating force to perform an action is his innate longing for \"priti\" (pleasure, happiness),\nwhether at the lowest level or the highest level.\nAt the highest level, it is nothing but an unsurpassed state of \"priti\",\nwhich is ensured only by performing ethical actions.\n</poem>\n– Sabara, 2nd century Mīmānsā scholar\nAccording to Daniel Arnold, Mīmānsā scholarship has \"striking affinities\" with that of William Alston, the 20th century Western philosopher, along with some notable differences. The Mīmānsākas subjected to a radical critique, more than two thousand years ago, states Francis Clooney, the notions such as \"God,\" the \"sacred text,\" the \"author\" and the \"anthropocentric ordering of reality\".\n\nIn the field of epistemology, later Mīmāṃsākas made some notable contributions. Unlike the Nyaya or the Vaisheshika systems, the sub-school of Mīmāṃsā recognizes five means of valid knowledge (Skt. \"pramāṇa\"). The sub-school of Mīmāṃsā recognizes one additional sixth, namely \"anuapalabdhi\", just like Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism. These six epistemically reliable means of gaining knowledge are:\n\nMain article : Pratyaksha\n\n\"Pratyakṣa\" (प्रत्यक्ष्य) means perception. It is of two types in Mīmānsā and other schools of Hinduism: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind. The ancient and medieval Indian texts identify four requirements for correct perception: \"Indriyarthasannikarsa\" (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), \"Avyapadesya\" (non-verbal; correct perception is not through hearsay, according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), \"Avyabhicara\" (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and \"Vyavasayatmaka\" (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe). Some ancient scholars proposed \"unusual perception\" as \"pramana\" and called it internal perception, a proposal contested by other Indian scholars. The internal perception concepts included \"pratibha\" (intuition), \"samanyalaksanapratyaksa\" (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and \"jnanalaksanapratyaksa\" (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state). Further, some schools of Hinduism considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from \"Pratyakṣa-pramana\", so as to contrast \"nirnaya\" (definite judgment, conclusion) from \"anadhyavasaya\" (indefinite judgment).\n\nMain article : Anumana\n\n\"Anumāṇa\" (अनुमान) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason. Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of \"Anumana\". In all except one Hindu philosophies, this is a valid and useful means to knowledge. The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts: \"pratijna\" (hypothesis), \"hetu\" (a reason), and \"drshtanta\" (examples). The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts, state the ancient Indian scholars: \"sadhya\" (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and \"paksha\" (the object on which the \"sadhya\" is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if \"sapaksha\" (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if \"vipaksha\" (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps. For example, they demand \"Vyapti\" - the requirement that the \"hetu\" (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in \"all\" cases, in both \"sapaksha\" and \"vipaksha\". A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a \"nigamana\" (conclusion).\n\nMain article : Upamāṇa\n\n\"Upamāṇa\" means comparison and analogy. Some Hindu schools consider it as a proper means of knowledge. \"Upamana\", states Lochtefeld, may be explained with the example of a traveller who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later. The subject of comparison is formally called \"upameyam\", the object of comparison is called \"upamanam\", while the attribute(s) are identified as \"samanya\". Thus, explains Monier Monier-Williams, if a boy says \"her face is like the moon in charmingness\", \"her face\" is \"upameyam\", the moon is \"upamanam\", and charmingness is \"samanya\". The 7th century text Bhaṭṭikāvya in verses 10.28 through 10.63 discusses many types of comparisons and analogies, identifying when this epistemic method is more useful and reliable, and when it is not. In various ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism, 32 types of \"Upanama\" and their value in epistemology are debated.\n\n\"Arthāpatti\" (अर्थापत्ति) means postulation, derivation from circumstances. In contemporary logic, this \"pramāṇa\" is similar to circumstantial implication. As example, if a person left in a boat on river earlier, and the time is now past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this \"pramāṇa\" as invalid or at best weak, because the boat may have gotten delayed or diverted. However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable. Another common example for \"arthāpatti\" found in the texts of Mīmāṃsā and other schools of Hinduism is, that if \"Devadatta is fat\" and \"Devadatta does not eat in day\", then the following must be true: \"Devadatta eats in the night\". This form of postulation and deriving from circumstances is, claim the Indian scholars, a means to discovery, proper insight and knowledge. The Hindu schools that accept this means of knowledge state that this method is a valid means to conditional knowledge and truths about a subject and object in original premises or different premises. The schools that do not accept this method, state that postulation, extrapolation and circumstantial implication is either derivable from other \"pramāṇas\" or flawed means to correct knowledge, instead one must rely on direct perception or proper inference.\n\nMain article : Anupalabdhi, See also: Abhava\n\n\"Anupalabdi\" (अनुपलब्धि), accepted only by Kumarila Bhatta sub-school of Mīmāṃsā, means non-perception, negative/cognitive proof. \"Anupalabdhi pramana\" suggests that knowing a negative, such as \"there is no jug in this room\" is a form of valid knowledge. If something can be observed or inferred or proven as non-existent or impossible, then one knows more than what one did without such means. In the two schools of Hinduism that consider \"Anupalabdhi\" as epistemically valuable, a valid conclusion is either \"sadrupa\" (positive) or \"asadrupa\" (negative) relation - both correct and valuable. Like other \"pramana\", Indian scholars refined \"Anupalabdi\" to four types: non-perception of the cause, non-perception of the effect, non-perception of object, and non-perception of contradiction. Only two schools of Hinduism accepted and developed the concept \"non-perception\" as a \"pramana\". The schools that endorsed \"Anupalabdi\" affirmed that it as valid and useful when the other five \"pramanas\" fail in one's pursuit of knowledge and truth.\n\n\"Abhava\" (अभाव) means non-existence. Some scholars consider \"Anupalabdi\" to be same as \"Abhava\", while others consider \"Anupalabdi\" and \"Abhava\" as different. \"Abhava-pramana\" has been discussed in ancient Hindu texts in the context of \"Padārtha\" (पदार्थ, referent of a term). A \"Padartha\" is defined as that which is simultaneously \"Astitva\" (existent), \"Jneyatva\" (knowable) and \"Abhidheyatva\" (nameable). Specific examples of \"padartha\", states Bartley, include \"dravya\" (substance), \"guna\" (quality), \"karma\" (activity/motion), \"samanya/jati\" (universal/class property), \"samavaya\" (inherence) and \"vishesha\" (individuality). \"Abhava\" is then explained as \"referents of negative expression\" in contrast to \"referents of positive expression\" in \"Padartha\". An absence, state the ancient scholars, is also \"existent, knowable and nameable\", giving the example of negative numbers, silence as a form of testimony, \"asatkaryavada\" theory of causation, and analysis of deficit as real and valuable. \"Abhava\" was further refined in four types, by the schools of Hinduism that accepted it as a useful method of epistemology: \"dhvamsa\" (termination of what existed), \"atyanta-abhava\" (impossibility, absolute non-existence, contradiction), \"anyonya-abhava\" (mutual negation, reciprocal absence) and \"pragavasa\" (prior, antecedent non-existence).\n\n\"Śabda\" (शब्द) means relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts. Hiriyanna explains \"Sabda-pramana\" as a concept which means reliable expert testimony. The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly. He must rely on others, his parent, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other's lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through \"Sabda\" (words). The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the \"Sabda\" of reliable sources. The disagreement between the schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability. Some schools, such as Carvaka, state that this is never possible, and therefore \"Sabda\" is not a proper pramana. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.\n\nAn interesting feature of the Mīmāṃsā school of philosophy is its unique epistemological theory of the intrinsic validity of all cognition as such. It is held that all knowledge is \"ipso facto\" true (Skt. \"svataḥ prāmāṇyavāda\"). Thus, what is to be proven is not the truth of a cognition, but its falsity. The Mīmāṃsākas advocate the self-validity of knowledge both in respect of its origin (\"utpatti\") and ascertainment (\"jñapti\"). Not only did the Mīmāṃsākas make the very great use of this theory to establish the unchallengeable validity of the Vedas, but later Vedantists also drew freely upon this particular Mīmāṃsā contribution.\n\nThe core tenets of are ritualism (orthopraxy), anti-asceticism and anti-mysticism. The central aim of the school is elucidation of the nature of \"dharma\", understood as a set ritual obligations and prerogatives to be performed properly.\n\nMīmāṃsā theorists decided that the evidence allegedly proving the existence of God was insufficient. They argue that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a God to validate the rituals. Mīmāṃsā argues that the Gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the \"mantras\" that speak their names. To that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of Gods.\n\nDharma as understood by Pūrva Mīmāṃsā can be loosely translated into English as \"virtue\", \"morality\" or \"duty\". The Pūrva Mīmāṃsā school traces the source of the knowledge of dharma neither to sense-experience nor inference, but to verbal cognition (i.e. knowledge of words and meanings) according to Vedas. In this respect it is related to the Nyāya school, the latter, however, accepts only four sources of knowledge (\"pramāṇa\") as valid.\n\nThe Pūrva Mīmāṃsā school held dharma to be equivalent to following the prescriptions of the Saṃhitās and their Brāhmaṇa commentaries relating the correct performance of Vedic rituals. Seen in this light, Pūrva Mīmāṃsā is essentially ritualist (orthopraxy), placing great weight on the performance of karma or action as enjoined by the Vedas.\n\nEmphasis of Yajnic Karmakāṇḍas in Pūrva Mīmāṃsā is erroneously interpreted by some to be an opposition to Jñānakāṇḍa of Vedānta and Upaniṣads. Pūrva Mīmāṃsā does not discuss topics related to Jñānakāṇḍa, such as salvation (\"mokṣa\"), but it never speaks against mokṣa. Vedānta quotes Jaimini's belief in Brahman as well as in mokṣa:\n\nIn Uttara-Mīmāṃsā or Vedānta (4.4.5-7), Bāḍarāyaṇa cites Jaimini as saying (ब्राह्मेण जैमिनिरूपन्यासादिभ्यः) \"(The mukta Puruṣa is united with the Brahman) as if it were like the Brahman, because descriptions (in Śruti etc) prove so\".\n\nIn Vedānta (1.2.28), Bāḍarāyaṇa cites Jaimini as saying that \"There is no contradiction in taking Vaishvānara as the supreme Brahman\".\n\nIn 1.2.31, Jaimini is again quoted by Bāḍarāyana as saying that the nirguna (attribute-less) Brahman can manifest itself as having a form.\n\nIn 4.3.12, Bādarāyana again cites Jaimini as saying that the mukta Purusha attains Brahman.\n\nIn Pūrva Mīmāṃsā too, Jaimini emphasises the importance of faith in and attachment to the Omnipotent Supreme Being Whom Jaimini calls \"The Omnipotent Pradhaana\" (The Main):\n\nPūrva Mīmāṃsā 6.3.1: \"sarvaśaktau pravṛttiḥ syāt tathābhūtopadeśāt\" (सर्वशक्तौ प्रवृत्तिः स्यात् तथाभूतोपदेशात्). The term \"upadeśa\" here means instructions of the śāstras as taught. We should tend towards the omnipotent supreme being. In the context of Pūrva Mīmāṃsā 6.3.1 shown above, next two sutras becomes significant, in which this Omnipotent Being is termed as \"pradhāna\", and keeping away from Him is said to be a \"doṣa\", hence all beings are asked to get related (\"abhisambandhāt\" in tadakarmaṇi ca doṣas tasmāt tato viśeṣaḥ syāt pradhānenābhisambandhāt; Jaimini 6, 3.3) to the \"Omnipotent Main Being\" (api vāpy ekadeśe syāt pradhāne hy arthanirvṛttir guṇamātram itarat tadarthatvāt; Jaimini 6, 3.2). Karma-Mīmāṃsā supports the Vedas, and Rgveda says that one Truth is variously named by the sages. It is irrelevant whether we call Him as Pradhāna or Brahman or Vaishvānara or Shiva or God.\n\nThe school's origins lie in the scholarly traditions of the final centuries BCE, when the priestly ritualism of Vedic sacrifice was being marginalized by Buddhism and Vedanta. To counteract this challenge, several groups emerged dedicated to demonstrating the validity of the Vedic texts by rigid formulation of rules for their interpretation. The school gathers momentum in the Gupta period with Śābara, and reaches its apex in the 7th to 8th centuries with and Prabhākara.\n\nThe school for some time in the Early Middle Ages exerted near-dominant influence on learned Hindu thought, and is credited as a major force contributing to the decline of Buddhism in India, but it has fallen into decline in the High Middle Ages and today is all but eclipsed by Vedanta.\n\nThe foundational text for the Mīmāṃsā school is the Purva Mīmāṃsā Sutras of Jaimini (ca. 5th to 4th century BCE). A major commentary was composed by Śābara in ca. the 1th century BC. The school reaches its height with and (fl. ca. 700 CE). Both Kumarila Bhatta and Prabhākara (along with , whose work is no more extant) have written extensive commentaries on Śābara's Mīmāṃsāsūtrabhāṣyam.\nKumārila Bhaṭṭa, Mandana Miśra, Pārthasārathi Miśra, Sucarita Miśra, Ramakrishna Bhatta, Madhava Subhodini, Sankara Bhatta, Krsnayajvan, Anantadeva, Gaga Bhatta, Ragavendra Tirtha, VijayIndhra Tirtha, Appayya Dikshitar, Paruthiyur Krishna Sastri, Mahomahapadyaya Sri Ramsubba Sastri, Sri Venkatsubba Sastri, Sri A. Chinnaswami Sastri, Sengalipuram Vaidhyanatha Dikshitar were some of Mīmānsā scholars.\n\nThe ' of Jaimini (c. 3rd century BCE) has summed up the general rules of ' for Vedic interpretation.

{"id": "21052174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21052174", "title": "Pleiades in folklore and literature", "text": "Pleiades in folklore and literature\n\nThe high visibility of the star cluster Pleiades in the night sky has guaranteed it a special place in many cultures, both ancient and modern. The heliacal rising of Pleiades often marks important calendar points for ancient peoples.\n\nThe Tuareg Berbers living in the desert of North Africa call the Pleiades Cat iheḍ (pronounced: \"shat ihedd\"), or Cat ahăḍ (pronounced: \"shat ahadd\"). The name means in Berber: \"daughters of the night\". Other Berbers call this star cluster: Amanar (meaning: \"the guide\") or Tagemmunt (meaning: \"the group\").\n\nA Tuareg Berber proverb says:\n\n\"Cat ahăḍ as uḍănăt, ttukayeɣ ttegmyeɣ, anwar daɣ ttsasseɣ. As d-gmaḍent, ttukayeɣ ttegmyeɣ tabruq ttelseɣ.\"\n\nTranslation: When the Pleiades fall, I wake up looking for my goatskin bag to drink. When (the Pleiades) rise, I wake up looking for a cloth to wear.\n\nMeaning: When the Pleiades \"fall\" with the sun on the west, it means the hot season is coming, which implies the heat and the thirst of the summer. When the Pleiades rise from the east with the sun, it means the cold and rainy season is coming, and thus one does well to prepare for the cold.\n\nIn the Bible, the Pleiades are mentioned as כימה (\"Khima\") three times, always in conjunction with Orion—Amos 5:8; Job 9:9; and Job 38:31. The first two verses are references about their creation, but the third (taken in the context of the following verses) may be more about their ongoing appearance in the night sky. In Job 38:31, the Lord is speaking directly to Job and challenges him, asking if he can bind the chains of the Pleiades—the implication being that Job cannot, but the Lord can. Talmud (Bavli, Berakhot, 58b) says that it has about 100 stars, understanding the word כימה as כמאה \"ke' me-ah,\" \"about one hundred\" in Hebrew.\n\nThey are known as kimah in Jewish culture.\n\nLike most other astronomical findings in the Talmud, rabbinic tradition claims to have gotten such knowledge from Moses when he descended down from Mount Sinai, and hence, from God Himself.\n\nRabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki (\"Rashi\", 1040-1105), suggested that there were even more stars within the Pleiades Cluster when he expanded on the Talmud's question, \"What is meant by Kimah?” which is understood by the modern Orthodox community to mean that there are more than a hundred stars. Therefore, Rashi was saying that the passage in the Talmud only mentioned the most important stars, this numbering to about a hundred, while leaving out the less important ones (which could be hundreds more).\n\nAmazingly, the Pleiades are at max, 500 light years away, and here were the rabbis, commenting on the number of stars where other cultures could only detect 6-7.\n\nIn Arabic the Pleiades are known as \"al-Thurayya\" الثريا, and mentioned in Islamic literature. Muhammad is noted to have counted twelve stars in the constellation as reported in Ibn Ishaq (this was in the time before telescopes when most could only see six).\nThe name was borrowed into Persian and Turkish as a female given name, and is in use throughout the Middle East (for example Princess Soraya of Iran and Thoraya Obaid). It is also the name of the Thuraya satellite phone system based in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nMuhammad made mention of the Pleiades. A Hadith recalled by Imam Bukhari, states:\n\n\"*The chapter talked about above is Chapter 62 - Surah Al-Jummah - from the Qur'an.\"\n\n\"**The verse quoted here is verse 3 from the aforementioned chapter.\"\n\nIn Turkish the Pleiades are known as \"Ülker\". According to the Middle Turkic lexicographer Kaşgarlı Mahmud, writing in the 11th century, \"ülker çerig\" refers to a military ambush (\"çerig\" meaning 'troops in battle formation'): \"The army is broken up into detachments posted in various places,\" and when one detachment falls back the others follow after it, and by this device \"(the enemy) is often routed.\" Thus \"ülker çerig\" literally means 'an army made up of a group of detachments', which forms an apt simile for a star cluster. Ülker is also a unisex given name, a surname and the name of a food company best known for its chocolates.\n\nIn the Persian language Pleiades is known as \"Parvin\". Parvin is also a very popular given name in Iran and neighbouring countries (for example Parvin E'tesami).\n\nThe word has acquired a meaning of \"multitude\", inspiring the name of the French literary movement La Pléiade and an earlier group of Alexandrian poets, the Alexandrian Pleiad.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the stars of Pleiades represented the Seven Sisters.\n\nTo the Vikings, the Pleiades were Freyja's hens, and their name in many old European languages such as Hungarian compares them to a hen with chicks.\n\nThe astrological Pleiades were described in \"Three Books of Occult Philosophy\" by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (Köln, 1533, but published manuscript as early as 1510).\n\nIn Western astrology they represent coping with sorrow and were considered a single one of the medieval fixed stars. As such, they are associated with quartz and fennel.\n\nIn esoteric astrology the seven solar systems revolve around Pleiades.\n\nTo the Bronze Age people of Europe, such as the Celts (and probably considerably earlier), the Pleiades were associated with mourning and with funerals, since at that time in history, on the cross-quarter day between the autumn equinox and the winter solstice (see Samhain, also Halloween or All Souls Day), which was a festival devoted to the remembrance of the dead, the cluster rose in the eastern sky as the sun's light faded in the evening. It was from this acronychal rising that the Pleiades became associated with tears and mourning. As a result of precession over the centuries, the Pleiades no longer marked the festival, but the association has nevertheless persisted, and may account for the significance of the Pleiades astrologically.\n\nIn Baltic languages the name for this constellation is Sietynas in Lithuanian and Sietiņš in Latvian which is derived from \"sietas\" meaning \"a sieve\". In Lithuanian folk songs this constellation is often personified as a benevolent brother who helps orphan girls to marry or walks soldiers along the fields. But in Lithuanian folk tales as well as Latvian folk songs this constellation is usually depicted as an inanimate object, a sieve which gets stolen by the devil from the thunder god or is used to conjure light rain by thunder's wife and children.\n\nIn Ukrainian traditional folklore the Pleiades are known as Стожари (Stozhary), Волосожари (Volosozhary), or Баби-Звізди (Baby-Zvizdy).\n\n'Stozhary' can be etymologically traced to \"стожарня\" (stozharnya) meaning a 'granary', 'storehouse for hay and crops', or can also be reduced to the root \"сто-жар\", (sto-zhar) meaning 'hundredfold glowing' or \"a hundred embers\".\n\n'Volosozhary' (the ones whose hair is glowing), or 'Baby-Zvizdy' (female-stars) refer to the female tribal deities. According to the legend, seven maids lived long ago. They used to dance the traditional round dances and sing the glorious songs to honor the gods. After their death the gods turned them into water nymphs, and, having taken them to the Heavens, settled them upon the seven stars, where they dance their round dances (symbolic for moving the time) to this day. (see article in Ukrainian Wikipedia)\n\nIn Ukraine this asterism was considered a female talisman until recent times.\n\nThe old name of the starcluster in Hungarian is \"Fiastyúk\", meaning 'a hen with chicks'. There is also a version of the story popularized by the song \"A Nap és Szép háza\" (House of Sun and Wind) of Hungarian folk metal band Dalriada speaking of a poor woman with seven sons who cursed her sons to turn into ravens after the sons wasted their only food. She failed to find them, but received a prophecy that an eighth brother could find the sons. Her eighth son thus went to look for his brothers, died and the brothers as ravens came to feast on his carcass, resulting in them dying as well and the eight of them getting a place in the sky as the Pleiades cluster. \n\nIt was common among the indigenous peoples of the Americas to measure keenness of vision by the number of stars the viewer could see in the Pleiades, a practice which was also used in historical Europe, especially in Greece.\n\nIn the ancient Andes, the Pleiades were associated with abundance, because they return to the Southern Hemisphere sky each year at harvest-time. In Quechua they are called \"Qullqa\" (storehouse).\n\nThe ancient Aztecs of Mexico and Central America based their calendar upon the Pleiades. Their year began when priests first remarked the asterism heliacal rising in the east, immediately before the sun's dawn light obliterated the view of the stars. Aztecs called the Pleiades Tianquiztli (meaning \"marketplace\").\n\nPaul Goble, Native American storyteller, tells a Blackfoot legend that he says is told by other tribes as well. In the story, the Pleiades are orphans (\"Lost Boys\") that were not cared for by the people, so they became stars. Sun Man is angered by the mistreatment of the children and punishes the people with a draught, causing the buffalo to disappear, until the dogs, the only friends of the orphans, intercede on behalf of the people. Because the buffalo are not available while the Lost Boys are in the skies, the cosmical setting of the Pleaides was an assembly signal for Blackfoot hunter to travel to their hunting grounds to conduct the large-scale hunts, culminating in slaughters at buffalo jumps, that characterized their culture.\n\nA Cherokee myth (similar to that of the Onondaga people) indicates that seven boys who would not do their ceremonial chores and wanted only to play, ran around and around the ceremonial ball court in a circle, and rose up into the sky. Only six of the boys made it to the sky; the seventh was caught by his mother and fell to the ground with such force that he sank into the ground. A pine tree grew over his resting place.\n\nA Cheyenne myth \"The Girl Who Married a Dog\", states that the group of seven stars known as the Pleiades originated from seven puppies which a Cheyenne chief's daughter gave birth to after mysteriously being visited by a dog in human form to whom she vowed \"Wherever you go, I go\".\n\nThe Hopi had a relatively limited star lore, but determined the passage of time for nighttime rituals in the winter by observing the Pleiades (\"Tsöösöqam\") and Orion through a kiva entrance hatch as they passed overhead. The Pleiades were depicted in a mural on one kiva wall.\n\nThe Lakota Tribe of North America had a legend that linked the origin of the Pleiades to Devils Tower. According to the Seris (of northwestern Mexico), these stars are seven women who are giving birth. The constellation is known as \"Cmaamc\", which is apparently an archaic plural of the noun \"cmaam\" \"woman\".\n\nThe Monache people tell of six wives who loved onions more than their husbands and now live happily in \"sky country\".\n\nThe early Monte Alto Culture, and others in Guatemala such as Ujuxte and Takalik Abaj, made their early observatories using the Pleiades and \"Eta Draconis\" as reference; they were called \"the seven sisters\", and thought to be their original land.\n\nA Nez Perce myth about this constellation mirrors the ancient Greek myths about the Lost Pleiades. In the Nez Perce version the Pleiades is also a group of sisters, however the story itself is somewhat different. One sister falls in love with a man and, following his death, is so absorbed by her own grief that she tells her sisters about him. They mock her and tell her how silly it is of her to feel sad for the human after his death, and she in return keeps her growing sadness to herself, eventually becoming so ashamed and miserable about her own feelings that she pulls the sky over her face like a veil, blocking herself from view. This myth explains why there are only six of the seven stars visible to the naked eye.\n\nThe Pleiades (\"dilγéhé\") play a major role in Navajo folklore and ritual. In the Navajo creation story, Upward-reachingway, \"dilγéhé\" was the first constellation placed in the sky by Black God. When Black God entered the hogan of creation, the Pleiades were on his ankle; he stamped his foot and they moved to his knee, then to his ankle, then to his shoulder, and finally to his left temple. The seven stars of \"dilγéhé\" are depicted on ceremonial masks of Black God, in sand paintings and on ceremonial gourd rattles.\n\nThe Onondaga people's version of the story has lazy children who prefer to dance over their daily chores ignoring the warnings of the Bright Shining Old Man.\n\nThe Skidi Pawnee consider the Pleiades to be seven brothers. They observed the seven brothers, as well as Corona Borealis, the Chiefs, through the smoke hole of Pawnee lodges to determine the time of night.\n\nThe Shasta people tell a story of the children of racoon killed by coyote avenging their father's death and then rising into the sky to form the Pleiades. The smallest star in the cluster is said to be coyote's youngest who aided the young racoons.\n\nAmong the Ban Raji people, who live in semi-nomadic settlements scattered throughout western Nepal and northern India, the Pleiades are called the \"Seven sisters-in-law and one brother-in-law\" (\"Hatai halyou daa salla\"). Ban Rajis note that when the Pleiades rises up over the mountain each night, they feel happy to see their ancient kin (Fortier 2008: in press). On a more practical note, Ban Rajis can tell that evening has arrived, indicating that it is about eight o'clock by local time standards when their star-kin rise above the Nepali mountains bordering the Kali River.\n\nIn Chinese constellations they are 昴 \"mao\", the \"Hairy Head\" of the white tiger of the West.\n\nIn Indian astrology the Pleiades were known as the nakshatra which in Sanskrit is translated as \"the cutters\". The Pleiades are called the \"star of fire,\" and their ruling deity is the fire god Agni. It is one of the most prominent of the nakshatra, and is associated with anger and stubbornness. Karthigai (கார்த்திகை) in Tamil refers to the six wives of the six rishi (sages), the seventh being Arundhati the wife of Vasistha which relates to the star Alcor in Ursa Major. The six stars in Pleiades correspond to six wives, while the faithful wife Arundhati stuck with Sage Vasistha in Ursa Major. The six wives fell in love with Agni, hence the name Pleiades (star of fire).\n\nIn the island of Java, the asterism is known in Javanese as \"Lintang Kartika\" or \"Gugus Kartika\" (\"Kartika cluster\"), a direct influence from the ancient Hindu Javanese. Influenced by Hinduism, the stars represent the seven princesses, which is represented in the court dance of Bedhaya Ketawang of the royal palaces of Surakarta. The dance is performed once per year, on the second day of the Javanese month of Ruwah (during May) and is performed by the nine females, relatives or wives of the Susuhunan (prince) of Surakarta before a private audience in the inner circle of the Sultanate family. Another name for Pleiades in Java is \"Wuluh\".\n\nIn northern Java, its rising marks the arrival of the \"mangsa kapitu\" (\"seventh season\"), which marks the beginning of rice planting season.\n\nIn Japan, the Pleiades are known as 昴 \"Subaru\" which means \"coming together\" or cluster in Japanese, and have given their name to the car manufacturer whose logo incorporates six stars to represent the five companies that merged into one. Subaru Telescope, located in Mauna Kea Observatory on Hawaii, is also named after the Pleiades.\n\nIn Thailand the Pleiades are known as (ดาวลูกไก่) or the \"Chick Stars\", from a Thai folk tale. The story tells that a poor elderly couple who lived in a forest had raised a family of chickens: a mother hen and her six (or alternately seven) chicks. One day a monk arrived at the couple's home during his Dhutanga journey. Worried that they had no suitable food to offer him, the elderly couple contemplated cooking the mother hen. The hen overheard the conversation, and rushed back to the coop to say farewell to her children. She told them to take care of themselves, and that her death would repay the kindness of the elderly couple, who had taken care of all of them for so long. As the mother hen's feathers were being burned over a fire, the chicks threw themselves into fire in order to die along with their mother. The deity, impressed by and in remembrance of their love, immortalized the seven chickens as the stars of the Pleiades. In tellings of the story in which there were only six chicks, the mother is included, but often includes only the seven chicks.\n\nDepending on the language group or clan, there are several Aboriginal stories regarding the origins of the Pleiades. Some Indigenous Australian peoples believed the Pleiades was a woman who had been nearly raped by Kidili, the man in the moon.\n\nIn a legend told by the Wurundjeri people of south-eastern Australia, the Pleiades were represented by the seven Karatgurk sisters. These women were the first to possess the secret of fire and each one carried live coals on the end of her digging stick. Although they refused to share these coals with anybody, they were ultimately tricked into giving up their secret by Crow, who subsequently brought fire to mankind. After this, the Karatgurk sisters were swept into the night sky. Their glowing fire sticks became the bright stars of the Pleiades cluster.\n\nAnother version, often painted by Gabriella Possum Nungurayyi as this is her dreaming (or creation story), daughter of the late Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri from the Central desert art movement of Papunya, depicts the story of seven Napaltjarri sisters being chased by a man named Jilbi Tjakamarra. He tried to practice love magic on one of the sisters but the sister did not want to be with him, and ran away from him together with her sisters. They sat down at Uluru to search for honey ants but when they saw Jilbi, they went to Kurlunyalimpa and with the spirits of Uluru, transformed into stars. Jilbi transforms himself into what is commonly known as the Morning Star in Orion's belt , thus continuing to chase the seven sisters across the sky.\n\nThere is an analogous holiday in Hawaiʻi known as Makahiki.\n\nOccurring June 20 – June 22, the winter solstice (\"Te Maruaroa o Takurua\") is seen by the New Zealand Māori as the middle of the winter season. It follows directly after the first sighting of \"Matariki\" (The Pleiades) and \"Puanga/Puaka\" (Rigel) in the dawn sky, an event which marked the beginning of the New Year and was said to be when the Sun turned from his northern journey with his winter-bride \"Takurua\" (Sirius) and began his journey back to his summer-bride \"Hine Raumati\".\n\nIn the Swahili language of East Africa they are called \"kilimia\" (Proto-Bantu *ki-dimida in Bantu areas E, F, G, J, L, and S) which comes from the verb \"-lima\" meaning \"dig\" or \"cultivate\" as their visibility was taken as a sign to prepare digging as the onset of the rain was near.\n\nIn the closely related Sesotho language of the Southern Africa's Basotho people the Pleiades are called \"Seleme se setshehadi\" (\"the female planter\"). Its disappearance in April (the 10th month) and the appearance of the star Achernar signals the beginning of the cold season. Like many other Southern African cultures, Basotho associate its visibility with agriculture and plenty.\n\nThe 19th century astronomer Johann Heinrich von Mädler proposed the Central Sun Hypothesis, according to which all stars revolve around the star Alcyone, in the Pleiades. Based on this hypothesis, the Jehovah's Witnesses religion taught until the 1950s that Alcyone was likely to be the site of the throne of God.\n\nIn Theosophy, it is believed the \"Seven Stars of the Pleiades\" focus the spiritual energy of the Seven Rays from the \"Galactic Logos\" to the \"Seven Stars of the Great Bear\", then to Sirius, then to the Sun, then to the god of Earth (Sanat Kumara) and finally through the seven Masters of the Seven Rays to us.\n\nIn Ufology some believers describe Nordic alien extraterrestrials (called Pleiadeans) as originating from this system.\n\nIn New Age lore, some believe that Sun and the Earth will pass through a Photon belt from the Pleiades, causing a cataclysm and/or initiating a spiritual transition (referred to variously as a \"shift in consciousness,\" the \"Great Shift,\" the \"Shift of the Ages\").\n\nBarbara Marciniak, author of \"Bringers of the Dawn\", is one of the authors who contributes to the New Age mythos of Pleiadian ET beings who are linked to human ancestry.\n\n"}

Skirt dancing was itself a reaction against \"academic\" forms of ballet, incorporating tamed-down versions of folk and popular dances like the can-can.\n\nThe new dance was originated by Loïe Fuller, who gave varying accounts of how she developed it. By her own account, which is widely reported, having never danced professionally before, she accidentally discovered the effects of stage light cast from different angles on the gauze fabric of a costume she had hastily assembled for her performance in the play \"Quack M.D.\", and spontaneously developed the new form in response to the audience's enthusiastic reaction upon seeing the way her skirt appeared in the lights. During the dance she held her long skirt in her hands, and waved it around, revealing her form inside.\n\nThe Serpentine Dance was a frequent subject of early motion pictures, as it highlighted the new medium's ability to portray movement and light. Two particularly well-known versions were \"Annabelle Serpentine Dance\" (1894), a performance by Broadway dancer Annabelle Whitford from Edison Studios, and a Lumière brothers film made in 1896. Many other filmmakers produced their own versions, distributing prints that had been hand-tinted to evoke (though not quite reproduce) the appearance of colored light projection.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9363023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9363023", "title": "The God Beneath the Sea", "text": "The God Beneath the Sea\n\nThe God Beneath the Sea is a children's novel based on Greek mythology, written by Leon Garfield and Edward Blishen, illustrated by Charles Keeping, and published by Longman in 1970. It was awarded the annual Carnegie Medal (Garfield & Blishen) and commended for the companion Greenaway Medal (Keeping) by the British Library Association. Pantheon Books published a U.S. edition with illustrations by Zevi Blum in 1971.\n\nThe novel begins with newborn Hephaestus (the titular god beneath the sea) cast from Mount Olympus by his mother Hera. He is raised in a grotto by Thetis and Eurynome and the two goddesses tell him various Greek creation myths. The novel continues with myths of the Olympians and the age of gods and mortals, and concludes with Hephaestus returning to Olympus, having been cast down for a second time after reproaching Zeus.\n\nGarfield, Blishen, Keeping, and Longman collaborated on a sequel entitled \"The Golden Shadow\" (1973, ).\nIt is based on myths of the later heroic age, when divine activity was limited.\n\n\"The God Beneath the Sea\" is divided into three parts. Part one begins with the image of the infant Hephaestus plummeting from Olympus to the ocean. Thetis saves the baby and takes him to the grotto she shares with Eurynome. They raise the baby, telling him stories of Greek myths and giving him a hammer and anvil to play with. Part one concludes with Hermes inviting Hephaestus back to Olympus at Hera's bequest, and Hephaestus claiming Aphrodite for his wife. Part two tells the myths of Prometheus and Pandora, and part three tells various myths of gods interacting with mortals. The novel concludes with the Olympians unsuccessfully attempting to overthrow Zeus, and Hephaestus returning to Olympus from Lemnos, having been cast down from Olympus for a second time after reproaching Zeus.\n\nIn Part I, \"The Making of the Gods\", Thetis and Eurynome tell Hephaestus stories of the Titans and Olympians, in hopes of quelling his restless nature. They begin with the myths of the Titans emerging from Chaos, then tell of the birth of the Cyclopes and Hecatonchires, and the overthrowal of Uranus by his son Cronus. They tell of Cronus' ascension to the throne with his queen Rhea, and his descent to madness after the Furies torment him nightly with prophecies that he, like his father, would be overthrown by his son.\n\nHephaestus grows uglier and more violent with age. Thetis and Eurynome give him a hammer, anvil and forge to vent his fury and discover he is a gifted smith. Hephaestus' most beautiful creation is a brooch depicting a sea nymph and her lover; he threatens to destroy the brooch unless Thetis tells him who he is and how he came to live in the grotto. The goddesses resume their tales: Rhea and Zeus conspire to overthrow Cronus. The avenging children of Cronus defeat and imprison the Titans, sparing Rhea, Prometheus and Epimetheus.\n\nThe gods fashion their home on Olympus, and Zeus seduces Hera by transforming himself into a cuckoo. Their child is hideous and misshapen, and Hera throws the child out into the sky. At the revelation of his parentage, Hephaestus breaks the brooch, and half is washed to sea. His desire for vengeance are tempered by the realization of Zeus' immense power. The narrative then shifts from Hephaestus and the goddesses to recount concurrent events amongst the Olympians, including the arrival at Olympus of Apollo, Artemis, Athene and Hermes.\n\nPregnant again, Hera overlooks Zeus' infidelities, resolving to remain calm to avoid another monstrous child. Hera gives birth to her second son, Ares, and the immortals come to Olympus to honor the newborn god. Zeus commands Hermes to find a gift for Ares. Hermes finds the lost half of Hephaestus' broken brooch and returns it to Zeus as a gift. Zeus creates Aphrodite in the image of the brooch's nymph. Hermes then reunites the broken half of the brooch with the other half, which is worn by Thetis.\n\nHera, struck by the beauty of the brooch, demands to know who fashioned the brooch, then dispatches Hermes to fetch Hephaestus. Hermes returns Hephaestus to Olympus; Hephaestus forgives Hera and asks Zeus for Aphrodite as a wife. Ares demands a birthright from Zeus, and Zeus makes him god of hatred, discord and war.\n\nIn Part II, \"The Making of Men\", Prometheus makes men out of clay and the substance of Chaos to inhabit the earth, fearing that Zeus will give the earth to one of his children as a plaything. At Zeus' behest, Hermes commands Prometheus to destroy his creations. Instead, Prometheus teaches his creatures to sacrifice and worship Zeus. Prometheus offers Zeus the choice of two portions as sacrifice; Zeus mistakenly chooses the poorer portion, and in retribution forbids mankind the use of fire. Prometheus steals fire for them in defiance of Zeus. He continues to watch over mankind, finding strange impurites in the substance of Chaos he'd used to create them. These he scrapes away and hides in a sealed jar.\n\nZeus commands Hephaestus to make a woman. The Olympians bless her with gifts, and Zeus names her Pandora. Hermes gives Pandora to Epimetheus as a wife. Zeus punishes Prometheus by chaining him to a pillar in the Caucasus, where a vulture eats his liver daily. At night his wounds heal, so that his punishment can begin anew the next morning.\n\nPandora eventually finds Prometheus' hidden jar. Opening it, she releases malignant furies on mankind: madness, old age, vice and sickness. All that is left in the jar is a chrysalis that works as a healing balm. Hermes consoles the despairing Prometheus that hope was left behind for mankind, \"for who knows what may unfold from a chrysalis?\"\n\nPart III, \"Gods and Men\", begins with the tale of Lycaon turned to a wolf by Zeus after treating him with disrespect. Zeus begins a deluge. Prometheus shouts a warning to Deucalion, who makes a sea vessel to survive the storm with his wife, Pyrrha. They land at Mount Parnassus, and after praying they repopulate the earth by casting stones over their shoulders. The stones transform to people when they land.\n\nThe novel then tells of Persephone's abduction by Hades, and Demeter's search for her. After learning of Persephone's abduction from a shepherd, Demeter swears to Zeus that she will withdraw her blessings from the earth unless Hades returns Persephone. Zeus agrees to let Persephone return if she has not tasted the food of the dead. Ascalaphus, a gardener in the underworld, remembers that Pandora ate seven pomegranate seeds in Hades, and Demeter turns him into a screech-owl. Rhea intercedes and Demeter agrees to let Persephone live with Hades for three months of the year.\n\nThe novel tells myths of Autolycus, the son of Hermes and Chione, and Sisyphus. Autolycus steals the cattle of his neighbor Sisyphus; Sisyphus gains revenge by raping Autolycus' daughter Anticleia. Autolycus sends Anticleia to Ithaca to marry Laertes, who raises Odysseus, the son of Sisyphus and Anticleia, as his own. Sisyphus spies Zeus ravishing the daughter of the river god Asopus and tells Asopus where he had seen them in return for a gift of an eternal spring. He tricks death by trapping Hades in his own manacles. Hades is freed by Ares, but Sisyphus escapes death a second time by deceiving Persephone. At last Hermes takes Sisyphus to Tartarus, to be condemned to roll a boulder up a hill for eternity.\n\nMeanwhile, Hera and the Olympians conspire to imprison Zeus in a net while he is distracted raining thunderbolts on Asopus. Thetis fetches Briareus to free him. Zeus punishes Hera by hanging her in the sky, and sets Poseidon and Apollo the vain task of building the doomed city of Troy. Hephaestus, seeing Hera's punishment, berates Zeus, and Zeus throws Hephaestus for a second time from Olympus. Hephaestus lands on the isle of Lemnos and is nursed to health by the locals. He returns to Olympus and is greeted by Hermes. At the novel's conclusion, Autolycus muses in a letter to his daughter that his grandson Odysseus may one day visit the new city of Troy.\n\nBlishen and Garfield began work on \"The God Beneath the Sea\" after discovering that Greek mythology had had similar impacts on them as primary school children. In Blishen's words, \"these stories seemed to illuminate, to make clear, what was going on around me in my small and unimportant life. They were about love ... They were about the desire for power, about jealousy, about triumph and great defeat.\" Garfield suggested they should \"write the stories for today's children\" and remove the \"upholstered Victorian quality\" of the stories as told to themselves.\n\nThe authors aimed to restore the power the myths had had for the Greeks, and for themselves as children. They decided to tell the myths not as separate stories but as \"a fresh and original piece of fiction\" and a single, continuous account of the origins of the world, of man's struggle against his surroundings, and of man's struggle with his own nature. They hoped while writing the book to present the myths as \"a total coherent account of the human situation, the human predicament, and human opportunities.\" One of the main difficulties they encountered was selecting a sequence of myths from \"the enormous expanse\" of Greek mythology to form a single story that would increase the power of the work.\n\nThey shared a concern about recent developments in children's literature and society's attitudes towards children. They felt that older children's literature had been moving closer to adult literature, and that the book had taken them \"further than [they'd] ever been taken before\" towards that end. They felt it necessary to address \"meaningful violence\" and \"the strongest of human passions\" in the novel, because these were \"the preoccupations with which our children are, we know, at the moment filled.\"\n\nBlishen and Garfield used four source texts: E. V. Rieu's translations of the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\", the Metamorphoses, and Robert Graves' \"The Greek Myths\". The authors' primary source text was Graves' \"The Greek Myths\", because of the simplicity of his writing. They also borrowed from Ovid and many musical sources, including Handel.\n\nAbout the writing process the authors told \"Junior Bookshelf\" (August 1971), \"We wrote together, much of the time. One of us would actually commit the words to paper. There were often long silences. These might be broken, not by a grave suggestion as to further text, but by some wild burst of laughter. Much of the matter we were dealing with was most grim and tense. Laughter - and some schoolboyish joking - helped.\"\n\nCharles Keeping drew fifteen illustrations for \"The God Beneath the Sea\". His work was widely acclaimed by critics, but Keeping himself was dissatisfied with the illustrations. He was not enthusiastic about working on the book when approached by Garfield, as he disliked the Greek myths. The myths had been presented to him in school \"in the most boring fashion\" and as an art student he found Greek art \"cold and dispassionate.\" He saw the customary method of illustrating Greek myths in a stylized mimicking of Greek vase painting as \"an utter bore.\"\n\nAfter Garfield told Keeping he was using Robert Graves as a source, Keeping read \"The Greek Myths\" and found them \"quite disgusting\" and \"completely devoid of any love. This is all lust, rape, revenge and violence of every possible kind.\" Keeping looked for a deeper significance and philosophy in the stories, finding links to the Bible and other stories from other cultures and religions, and \"some basic human passions.\" In attempting to \"cover all the ground [Garfield and Blishen] covered with fifteen drawings\", Keeping felt he had \"to take a group of shapes that would project what this meant to me.\"\n\nKeeping decided not to use Greek costume as he was concerned readers would react the same way he used to: \"What does it mean? What does it do? Am I just delving into the past?\" He also avoided modern dress as \"this would be old fashioned within another fifteen years\", deciding in the end to dispense with \"any form of recognizable costume\" while avoiding \"anything that is appertaining to our particular moment in time.\" He used \"a figurative art. There's nothing else in it... except people, their emotions and their reactions to emotions.\"\n\nKeeping called his completed illustrations for \"The God Beneath the Sea\" \"a set of drawings much to my disgust not all awfully good.\" He saw them as violent and cruel illustrations of violent and cruel people, and attempted to visually project this by taking \"a symbolic line, so if you look at them you will find there's a symbolic overtone in them.\" At the time of the book's publication, Keeping was looking forward to working with the authors on the sequel \"The Golden Shadow\", as he hoped \"to redeem some of the mistakes of the first one.\"\n\nThe Library Association recognised \"The God Beneath The Sea\" for both of its annual children's book awards, the Carnegie Medal and the Kate Greenaway Medal. Garfield and Blishen won the Carnegie Medal, for the year's best children's book by a British subject.\nKeeping was a commended runner up for the companion Greenaway Medal, a distinction retired after 2002.\n\nIt was considered a controversial book at the time of its publication, with critical opinion divided on its merits. Reactions were particularly divided over the novel's prose style; John Rowe Townsend observed that \"The authors were asking English prose to do something it has never been at ease with since the seventeenth century, and many reviewers thought that the Garfield-Blishen attempt at high flight ended like that of Icarus.\" Robert Nye felt the authors had \"fallen into the trap of making everything impossibly vivid [...] thereby losing many of the subtleties that matter.\" Alan Garner in the \"New Statesman\" criticized the novel's prose as \"overblown Victoriana, 'fine' writing at its worst, cliché-ridden to the point of satire, falsely poetic, groaning with imagery and, among such a grandiloquent mess, intrusively colloquial at times.\" Rosemary Manning wrote in the \"Times Literary Supplement\" that the writing is \"lush, meandering and self-indulgent,\" and \"larded with ... lazy adjectives ... and weighed down under laborious similes.\"\n\nPositive reviewers saw the book's writing style as reinvigorating Greek myths for modern readers. \"History Today\" praised the book's \"poetic writing\" and \"sense of the terror and mystery of the universe.\" A review in \"The Spectator\" called it \"a remarkable book\" that \"should evoke a response from anyone clogged within the classics, wanting to see the poetry afresh.\" Ted Hughes reviewed the book positively, noting the authors' attempt to \"crack the Victorian plaster\" of \"moralizing dullness... concentrated on the Ancient Greeks\". For Hughes, the novel made the myths \"vividly new\"; the authors \"stripped away the pseudo-classical draperies and produced an intense, highly coloured, primitive atmosphere.\" \"The Classical Journal\" stated the novel's chief strength was \"a liveliness and vigor, of both style and action.\"\n\nThe novel's narrative structure was singled out by reviewers with similarly divided verdicts. For Manning, the novel's opening, \"an excellent device ...to allow the book to start dramatically\", and subsequent moments of pace and tension, are ruined by chronic over-writing. Nye felt the use of the two falls of Hephaestus as a framing device \"makes sense of what comes in-between\", but for Nye \"it is a savage sort of sense, depending to a large extent on melodrama\". \"History Today\" claimed the choice to retell the myths as a continuous narrative resulted in \"a brilliant poetic fantasy\"; Hughes said of the novel's series of stories, \"[t]heir zest sweeps you along. It is a real feat, to make everything sound so first hand.\" \"Contemporary Review\" observed a \"slight decline in narrative cohesiveness\" in the second half of the book, after the \"fine ... reworking of the earlier myths\" but felt it \"detracts little from the effectiveness of dramatic and narrative motifs ... which help tie together the disparate myths so well.\" \"The Spectator\" claimed \"the narrative is handled with dramatic, and comic, awareness of the epic voyage into our creative origins.\"\n\nPhilip Pullman cites \"The God Beneath the Sea\" as an inspiration for his fantasy literature. A 2001 article in \"The Guardian\" named \"The God Beneath the Sea\" the ninth best children's book of all time, calling it \"[v]isceral, overpowering, defiantly undomesticated\" and \"the best ever rendering of the Greek myths in modern English.\"\n\nIn contrast to the writing's mixed reception, critics were unanimous in acknowledging the power of Charles Keeping's illustrations. In an otherwise scathing review, Garner called them \"a singular vision of what Classical myth must have been. Two drawings especially – Cronos and Prometheus – are more terrible and beautiful than Goya.\" Manning stated that Keeping's \"contributions are magnificent... From this book, it is Keeping's interpretation of the 'enormous violent energy' of the Greek myths that will be remembered.\" \"The Spectator\" called the illustrations \"totems of potency\"; \"Contemporary Review\" said the \"bold, forceful and imaginative illustrations\" added to the \"dramatic presentation of the myths.\" Hughes saw the illustrations as \"relating the stories to the primitive roots of myth, rather than to the civilized commentators, taking the stories from scholarship and handing them back to imagination.\" Writing on the occasion of Keeping's nomination for the 1974 Hans Christian Andersen Award, a reviewer in \"The Times\" singled out the illustrations for \"The God Beneath the Sea\" and its sequel \"The Golden Shadow\" as \"probably the most striking evidence of Keeping's forceful presence\".\n\nThe U.S. publisher Random House replaced Keeping's work with illustrations by Zevi Blum. They were not well received by critics; one described them as \"MGM-style drawings, which substituted for drama a soft coyness and prurience.\"\n\n\n"}

The Chinese observed that the pine, bamboo and plum do not wither as the cold days deepen into the winter season unlike many other plants. Known by them as the \"Three Friends of Winter\", they entered the conventions of East Asian culture. Together they symbolize steadfastness, perseverance, and resilience. They are highly regarded in Confucianism and as such represent the scholar-gentleman's ideal.\n\nThe Three Friends of Winter are common in works of Chinese art and those cultures influenced by it. The three are first recorded as appearing together in a ninth-century poem by the poet Zhu Qingyu (朱慶餘) of the Tang dynasty. The Southern Song dynasty artist Zhao Mengjian (趙孟堅, c. 1199–1264), among others of the time, made this grouping popular in painting. \n\nThe actual term \"Three Friends of Winter\" can be traced back to the earliest known mention in literature, the \"Record of the Five-cloud Plum Cottage\" (五雲梅舍記) from \"The Clear Mountain Collection\" (霽山集) by the Song dynasty writer Lin Jingxi (林景熙, 1242–1310):\n\nCulturally, the \"Three Friends of Winter\"—pine, bamboo, and plum—are grouped together in the context of winter because they all flourish at that season. For this reason they are commonly known as the \"Three Friends of Winter\". They are also referred to simply by their linked names: \"Song Zhu Mei\" (松竹梅) in Chinese, transliterated as \"Sho Chiku Bai\" in Japanese (literally \"pine, bamboo, plum\").\n\nIn a Korean poem by Kim Yuki (1580–1658), the three friends are brought together in order to underline the paradoxical contrast:\n\nIn Japan, they are particularly associated with the start of the Lunar New Year, appearing on greeting cards and as a design stamped into seasonal sweets.\n\n"}

{"id": "4967845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4967845", "title": "Video feedback", "text": "Video feedback\n\nVideo feedback is the process that starts and continues when a video camera is pointed at its own playback video monitor. The loop delay from camera to display back to camera is at least one video frame time, due to the input and output scanning processes; it can be more if there is more processing in the loop.\n\nFirst discovered shortly after Charlie Ginsburg invented the first video recorder for Ampex in 1956, video feedback was considered a nuisance and unwanted noise. Technicians and studio camera people were chastised for allowing a video camera to see its own monitor as the overload of self-amplified video signal wreaked havoc with the 1950s video pickup, often ruining the pickup. It could also cause screen burn-in on a playback TV and/or monitors of the time as well, by generating static brightly illuminated display patterns.\n\nIn the 1960s early examples of video feedback art become introduced into the psychedelic art scene in New York City. Nam June Paik is often cited as the first video artist, although this is disputed; he had clips of video feedback on display in New York City at the Greenwich Cafe in the mid 1960s. \n\nEarly video feedback works were created by media artist/experimenters on the East and West Coasts in the late 1960s and early 70's. Video feedback artists Steina and Woody Vasulka, with Richard Lowenberg and others, formed The Kitchen, which was located in the kitchen of a broken-down hotel in lower Manhattan; while Skip Sweeney and others founded Video Free America in San Francisco, to nurture their video art and feedback experiments.\n\nDavid Sohn mentions video feedback in his 1970 book \"Film, the Creative Eye\". This book was part of the base curriculum for Richard Lederer of St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, when he introduced making videofeedback as part of an English curriculum in his 1970s course Creative Eye in Film. Several students in this class participated regularly in the making and recording of videofeedback. Sony had released the VuMax series of recording video cameras and manually \"hand-looped\" video tape decks by this time which did two things: it increased the resolution of the video image, which made the picture more attractive, and it brought video tape recording technology within the general public's grasp for the first time and allowed for such video experimentation to take place by the general public.\n\nDuring the 1980s and into the 1990s video technology became enhanced and evolved into high quality, high definition video recording. Michael C. Andersen generated the first known mathematical formula of the videofeedback process, and he has also generated a Mendeleev's square to show the gradual progressive formulaic change of the video image as certain parameters are adjusted.\n\nIn the 1990s the rave scene and a social return to art of a more psychedelic nature brought back displays of video feedback on large disco dance floor video screens around the world. There are filters for Adobe Photoshop and non linear video editors that often have video feedback as the filter description, or as a setting on a filter. These filter types either mimic or directly utilize video feedback for its result effect and can be recognized by its vortex, phantasmagoric manipulation of the original recorded image.\n\nMany artists have used optical feedback. An example is Queen's music video for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" (1975). The effect (in this simple case) can be compared to looking at oneself between two mirrors.\n\nOther videos that use variations of video feedback include:\n\nThe opening titles sequence for the British science fiction series \"Doctor Who\" employed this technique from 1963 to 1973 (initially in black and white, redone in 1967 to showcase the show's new 625-line broadcast resolution and feature the Doctor's face (Patrick Troughton at that time), then redone again, in colour this time, in 1970. The next title sequence for the show, which debuted in 1973, abandoned this technique in favour of slit-scan photography.\n\nThe optical feedback discussed so far—video feedback, created by a camera pointing at its own monitor—is actually just one particular example of optical feedback. Perhaps the most obvious example of optical feedback in science is the optical cavity found in almost every laser, which typically consists of two mirrors between which light is amplified. In the late 1990s it was found that so-called unstable-cavity lasers produce light beams whose cross-section present a fractal pattern.\n\nOptical feedback in science is often closely related to video feedback, so an understanding of video feedback can be useful for other applications of optical feedback. Video feedback has been used to explain the essence of fractal structure of unstable-cavity laser beams. The page discovery of fractal lasers gives an account of laser fractals, the developments of this work, links to further reading, and relates the laser context with video feedback systems. \n\nVideo feedback is also useful as an experimental-mathematics tool. Examples of its use include the creation of Fractal patterns using multiple monitors or multiple images created using mirrors.\n\nThe page video feedback in science provides an overview.\n\nSoftology's Video Feedback page provides links and information about real and simulated video feedback.\n\nOptical feedback is also found in the image intensifier tube and its variants. Here the feedback is usually an undesirable phenomenon, where the light generated by the phosphor screen \"feeds back\" to the photocathode, causing the tube to oscillate, and ruining the image. This is typically suppressed by an aluminum reflective screen deposited on the back of the phosphor screen, or by incorporating a microchannel plate detector.\n\nOptical feedback has been used experimentally in these tubes to amplify an image, in the manner of the cavity laser, but this technique has had limited use.\n\nOptical feedback has also been experimented with as an electron source, since a photocathode-phosphor cell will 'latch' when triggered, providing a steady stream of electrons. See US Patent 4,531,122 for a typical application.\n\nDouglas Hofstadter discusses video feedback in his book \"I Am a Strange Loop\" about the human mind and consciousness. He devotes a chapter to describing his experiments with video feedback.\n\nAt some point during the session, I accidentally stuck my hand momentarily in front of the camera's lens. Of course the screen went all dark, but when I removed my hand, the previous pattern did not just pop right back onto the screen, as expected. Instead I saw a different pattern on the screen, but this pattern, unlike anything I'd seen before, was not stationary.\n"}

{"id": "1331269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1331269", "title": "Vision span", "text": "Vision span\n\nVision span or perceptual span is a controversial concept referring to the angular span (vertically and horizontally), within which the human eye has sharp enough vision to perform an action accurately (reading or face recognition). The visual field of the human eye spans approximately 120 degrees of arc. However, most of that arc is peripheral vision. The human eye has much greater resolution in the macula, where there is a higher density of cone cells. The field of view that is observed with sufficient resolution to read text typically spans about 6 degrees of arc, which is wide enough to allow a clear view of about five words in a row when printed text at ordinary size is held about 50 centimeters from the eyes. Regarding face processing, the field of view with a sufficient amount of information in order to recognise faces accurately spans about 7° which represents about 45% of a face. The brain creates the illusion of having a greater visual span by automatically and unconsciously moving the center of vision into any area of interest in the field of view.\n\nWhile reading, readers will fail to recognize a word unless they are fixating within three to four character spaces of the word. The same is true for speed readers and skimmers. Speed readers cannot answer questions about a main point or detail, if they did not fixate directly on it or within three character spaces of it (Just and Carpenter 1987). When a text is removed whilst reading, readers can only accurately report upon the word they were fixating upon or the next one to the right (McConkie and Hogaoam 1985). There is no evidence from eye movement research that individuals are making predictions of text based upon hypotheses about the words in the periphery so that they can skip over or spend less time on unimportant or redundant words.\n\nMost speed reading courses claim that the peripheral vision can be used to read text. This has been suggested impossible because the text is blurred out through lack of visual resolution. At best the human brain can only \"guess\" at the content of text outside the macular region. There simply are not enough cone cells away from the center of the visual field to identify words in the periphery of the field.\n\nIt has been suggested that the fixation span can be stretched through training (meta guiding) to take in as much as a line for the purpose of skimming or speed reading. However other sources suggest that using this method can result in a severely reduced comprehension rate in comparison to normal reading (\"rauding\").\n\nSome speed reading courses stress that the human eye has to move very quickly. They also stress that the human eye should move in a pattern to fill in the information that was not properly perceived. The effective limit for scanning speeds based upon the limit of the human eye's resolution is about 300 words per minute. It is claimed that such speeds also require great practice, and extremely rapid eye movements, although research suggests that such training is not possible. It has been suggested by some speed reading promoters that the readers who achieve such speeds are on the autism spectrum. Research into reading rate suggests that study strategies, rather than speed reading, explains why expert readers, such as professors and editors, are more efficient than others.\n\nFace recognition system requires several fixation on different location (typically in a triangular pattern) for a face to be recognised. The same is true for the so-called Super Recognisers who are persons with high face recognition capabilities. Similarly to the reading span, the Facespan might be modulated by difficulty, expertise, age, disorder and other idiosyncratic differences between individuals. The idiosyncratic differences are thus most probably due to differences in Facespan rather than in oculomotor strategy. Previous study revealed that the Vision span is more accurately defined in number of characters rather than in visual angle.\n\n\n"}

Short tours can last under an hour, while longer ones can take in multiple sits and last a full day or more. A walk can be led by a tour guide, as an escort.\n\nA Grand Tour was \"a long tour of major cities\" undertaken in Europe in the 17th through 19th centuries, as part of a wealthy young man's education, and involved visits to cities, historic and cultural sites, with pedestrian activity confined to these cities or sites. \n\nA pilgrimage is a religious journey traditionally taken on foot, to a location of significance to the walker's faith. Only a minority of contemporary pilgrimages are on foot. Chaucer's 14th-century narrative poem \"Canterbury Tales\" certainly indicates that a pilgrimage can involve pleasure. \n\nThere are also similarities between walking tours that involve long hikes and backpacking, while non-pedestrian backpacking is a kind of modern, inexpensive Grand Tour that makes use of public transport.\n\nA walking tour is generally distinguished from an escorted tour by its length and the employment of tour guides, and can be under 12 hours, or last for a week or more. They are led by guides that have knowledge of the sites, or the landscape, covered on the tour, and explanations and interpretations of the site can cover a range of subjects, including places with historical, cultural and artistic significance. Walking tours, of various kinds and length, are universally part of the tourism industry, and can be found around the world.\n\nMany walking tours involve a payment to the guide, although some operate on a tip system. The \"pay what you want\" model started around 2004, and can be found in many countries. The UK-based Guild of Registered Tour has criticised the system for not requiring any training or certification of its guides.\n\nSeveral cities now have groups that are employing dramatic spectacle to add interest to their tours. Usually guided by actors in costume playing a role, these walking tours create the feel of living history as guests walk in the footsteps of those who came before them. These tours, which blend history and dramatic narrative, share \"history in a non-academic, very accessible fashion.\"\n\nThese tours are similar in nature to promenade theatre. Although the theatrical nature of these tours is similar to museum theatre in that it makes use of first person interpretation, the fact that these tours take place outside of traditional museum settings and requires the audience to move through urban environments makes this style of walking tour a genre of its own.\n\nSelf-guided tours, utilise a range of methods to aid travel through a place, or landscape, such as books, maps, pamphlets, and audio material.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "681269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=681269", "title": "Yardie", "text": "Yardie\n\nYardie (or Yaadi) is a term often used, particularly within the Caribbean expatriate and Jamaican diaspora community, to refer to persons of Jamaican origin, though its exact meaning changes depending on context. The term is derived from the Jamaican patois for home or \"yard\". The term may have specifically originated from the crowded government yards of two-storey concrete homes found in Kingston and inhabited by poorer Jamaican residents.\n\nHowever, especially outside of Jamaica, \"yardies\" or \"the Yardies\" usually specifically refers to Jamaican gangs or organized crime groups and gangsters of Jamaican origin, nationality, or ethnicity. The term is often used interchangeably with the term \"posse\" or \"Jamaican posse\" to refer to crime groups of Jamaican origin, with the term \"Posse\" used more frequently in Jamaica, the United States, and Canada to refer to Jamaican, Jamaican-American, and Jamaican-Canadian crime groups, and \"Yardies\" being deployed more frequently in the United Kingdom. Yardie gangs or \"posses\" are involved in a wide array of criminal activity depending on their location, ranging from political corruption, political violence, and assassination in Jamaica to drug trafficking and gang violence in the U.S., Canada, and U.K.\n\nDerived from Jamaican Patois, the term \"yardie\" can be ambiguous, having multiple meanings depending on context. In the most innocuous sense, \"yardie\" can simply refer to a Jamaican national; as \"yard\" can mean \"home\" in Jamaican Patois, Jamaican expatriates who moved abroad to countries such as the U.K. and U.S. would often refer to themselves and other Jamaicans as \"yardies\". \"Yardie\" may also more specifically apply to those Jamaicans originating in the impoverished \"government yards\" or courtyards of Jamaican public housing, and the term was eventually applied to criminals and gang members originating from these \"yards.\" As the term \"yard\" in Jamaican Patois can also refer to a territory, turf, or piece of land, \"yardie\" further gained gang or criminal connotations as Jamaican gangs or criminals claimed certain \"territories\" or \"turf\" and referred to such territory as their \"yards.\" Subsequently, in the U.K. and, to a lesser extent, North America, the term \"Yardie\" most frequently refers to gangsters or gangs of Jamaica origin, though these gang members themselves may refer to their gangs as \"posses\" or \"crews.\" The term is especially common in the U.K. to describe Jamaican or British Jamaican organized crime groups and gangs, while \"posse\" has become the more common term in North America.\n\nIn the 1950s in Trenchtown, Kingston, Jamaica, the government created social housing developments employing large public courtyards, and the courtyard areas soon became the hub of social and recreational activity in the crowded housing of Trenchtown. With increasing overcrowding and poverty, however, squatting and homelessness developed within the yards. Crime, drug abuse, and violence overran the yards, while political corruption and clientelism led to local politicians buying and selling patronage within the community and paying gangs and violent political supporters to intimidate voters and threaten, assault, or kill political opponents.\n\nBy the 1970s and 1980s, political violence and politically-affiliated organized crime groups and street gangs became increasingly common in poorer areas of Jamaica, with gangs often led by older bosses known as \"dons\" (in reference to the Sicilian Mafia don) and participating in both apolitical drug trafficking and racketeering and political violence and political intimidation. These gangs became known as \"Yardies,\" \"posses\", or \"crews\". Accounts of the association between Jamaican political factions and the rise of the Yardies are given in the factual books \"Ruthless\" by Geoff Small and \"Born Fi' Dead\" by Laurie Gunst.\n\nBy the 1980s, a drop in government budgets resulted in less money being paid by political parties to their gangs of armed supporters. These political Yardie gangs thus increasingly turned to apolitical criminal activity, such as drug trafficking, to bring in income. At the same time, the Jamaican government severely cracked down on Yardie gangs and political violence in general, leading many so-called Yardie gangsters to immigrate abroad and establish gangs the U.K., U.S., and Canada. The establishment of Yardie gangs abroad coincided with the rise of crack cocaine in both North America and the U.K., and Yardie and Posse gangs from Jamaica became heavily involved in the trafficking of crack cocaine and other drugs, in addition to illegal gambling and other criminal activity.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the British government encouraged immigration to the country to fill existing job vacancies. Within the Caribbean community, new arrivals from Jamaica were sometimes referred to as \"Yardies\" due to reference of Jamaica as \"back a yard\" (or \"back home\"). A large influx of inner city Jamaican immigration to Britain during the 1980s led to the rise of gang violence or behaviour on the part of Jamaicans which became known in wider British society as \"Yardie culture\" and the participants \"Yardies\". The terms \"Yardie gang\" or \"Yardie gun violence\" were largely used by the British media to describe violent crimes in London's black community. The gangs in London are specifically known to have occupied and operated in their infamous grounds of Brixton, Harlesden, Hackney, Tottenham, Peckham and Notting Hill.\n\nJamaican-born British writer Victor Headley wrote a bestselling 1992 novel entitled \"Yardie\". In 2018, British actor Idris Elba made his directorial debut with his feature film \"Yardie\", based on Headley's book.\n\nYardie gangs are notorious for their involvement in gun crime and the illegal drug trade, notably marijuana and crack cocaine in the United Kingdom. In 1993, Yardies were blamed for the murder of Police Constable Patrick Dunne, shot dead while patrolling in Clapham. In 2006, Rohan Chung, described as a Jamaican yard gangster was given three life sentences for the murders of Noel Patterson and his daughters, Connie and Lorna Morrison.\n\nBritish police are hesitant to categorize Yardie gangs as organized crime, since there appears to be no real structure or central leadership; gang affiliations can be described as loose at best. Neither have Yardies made any attempts at setting up fronts for their illegal activities, nor any serious attempts to corrupt and infiltrate law enforcement organisations. Academics have noted a tendency to over-label black British crime as \"Yardie\"-related due to stereotype and social narrative.\n\nA number of operations to combat Yardie gun crime have been set up, notably Operation Trident in the London area. Yardies (or imitating) gangs also appear to be active in Bristol, Birmingham, Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Nottingham but to a lesser extent.\n\nSome maintain that the supposed reach and influence in communities of these \"Yardies\" is a myth.\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n"}

In her stereotypical form, Zealandia appears as a woman of European descent who is similar in dress and appearance to Britannia, who is said to be the mother of Zealandia.\n\nAs a direct link to both Mother Britain and the old world, she brought a sense of history and classical respectability to the colony during the formative years as a young nation.\nZealandia appeared on postage stamps, posters, cartoons, war memorials, and New Zealand government publications most commonly during the first half of the 20th century. Zealandia was a commonly used symbol of the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition, which was held in Wellington in 1939 and 1940. Three large Zealandia statues exist in New Zealand towns or cities; one is in Waimate, one is in Palmerston, and one in Symonds Street, Auckland. The first two (in stone) are Second Boer War memorials and the latter one (in bronze) is a New Zealand Wars memorial. Some smaller statues exist in museums and in private hands.\n\nZealandia also featured on one penny definitive postage stamps issued in 1901 and 1909 during the reign of Queen Victoria and Edward VII when it went from being a Colony to a Dominion and was also depicted on a stamp featuring the coat of arms issued in 1929.\n\nThe woman who appears on the left side of the coat of arms of New Zealand is Zealandia. Apart from the coat of arms, Zealandia is seldom depicted in works today, or indeed referred to.\n\n"}
