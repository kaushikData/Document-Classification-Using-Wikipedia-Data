{"id": "33148906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33148906", "title": "Anthropology of development", "text": "Anthropology of development\n\nThe anthropology of development is a term applied to a body of anthropological work which views development from a \"critical\" perspective. The kind of issues addressed, and implications for the approach typically adopted can be gleaned from a list questions posed by Gow (1996). These questions involve anthropologists asking why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short why does so much planned development fail? \n\nThis \"anthropology of development\" has been distinguished from \"development anthropology\". Development anthropology refers to the application of anthropological perspectives to the multidisciplinary branch of development studies. It takes international development and international aid as primary objects. In this branch of anthropology, the term development refers to the social action made by different agents (institutions, business, enterprise, states, independent volunteers) who are trying to modify the economic, technical, political or/and social life of a given place in the world, especially in impoverished, formerly colonized regions.\n\nDevelopment anthropologists share a commitment to simultaneously critique and contribute to projects and institutions that create and administer Western projects that seek to improve the economic well-being of the most marginalized, and to eliminate poverty. While some theorists distinguish between the 'anthropology of development' (in which development is the object of study) and development anthropology (as an applied practice), this distinction is increasingly thought of as obsolete.\n\nSome describe the anthropological critique of development as one that pits modernization and an eradication of the indigenous culture, but this is too reductive and not the case with the majority of scholarly work. In fact, most anthropologists who work in impoverished areas desire the same economic relief for the people they study as policymakers, however they are wary about the assumptions and models on which development interventions are based. Anthropologists and others who critique development projects instead view Western development itself as a product of Western culture that must be refined in order to better help those it claims to aid. The problem therefore is not that of markets driving out culture, but of the fundamental blind-spots of Western developmental culture itself. Criticism often focuses therefore on the cultural bias and blind-spots of Western development institutions, or modernization models that: systematically represent non-Western societies as more deficient than the West; erroneously assume that Western modes of production and historical processes are repeatable in all contexts; or that do not take into account hundreds of years of colonial exploitation by the West that has tended to destroy the resources of former colonial society. Most critically, anthropologists argue that sustainable development requires at the very least more inclusion of the people who the project aims to target to be involved in the creation, management and decision making process in the project creation in order to improve development.\n\nThe British government established the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute in 1937 to conduct social science research in British Central Africa. It was part of the colonial establishment, although its head, anthropologist Max Gluckman, was a critic of colonial rule. Gluckman refused to describe colonialism as a simple case of \"culture contact\" since it was not a case of cultures mutually influencing each other, but of the forced incorporation of Africans into a foreign social, political and economic system. The anthropologists of the Institute were core members of what came to be known as the \"Manchester school\" of anthropology noted for looking at issues of social justice such as apartheid and class conflict.\n\nThe term \"subculture of poverty\" (later shortened to \"culture of poverty\") made its first prominent appearance in the ethnography \"Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty\" (1959) by anthropologist Oscar Lewis. Lewis struggled to render \"the poor\" as legitimate subjects whose lives were transformed by poverty. He argued that although the burdens of poverty were systemic and therefore imposed upon these members of society, they led to the formation of an autonomous subculture as children were socialized into behaviors and attitudes that perpetuated their inability to escape the underclass. In sociology and anthropology, the concept created a backlash, pushing scholars to abandon cultural justifications and negative descriptions of poverty, fearing such analysis may be read as \"blaming-the-victim.\"\n\nThe most influential modernization theorist in development was Walt Rostow, whose \"The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto\" (1960) concentrates on the economic side of the modernization, and especially the factors needed for a country to reach \"take-off\" to self-sustaining growth. He argued that today's underdeveloped areas are in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that therefore the task in helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Rostow's unilineal evolutionist model hypothesized all societies would progress through the same stages to a modernity defined by the West. The model postulates that economic growth occurs in five basic stages, of varying length:\n\n\nAs should be clear from the subtitle of his book, Rostow sought to provide a capitalist rebuttal to the unilinear Marxist growth models being pursued in the newly independent communist regimes in the second and third world; an effort that would lead to the \"Green revolution\" to combat the \"Red revolution\".\n\nGeorge Dalton applied the substantivist economic ideas of Karl Polanyi to economic anthropology, and to development issues. The substantivist approach demonstrated the ways in which economic activities in non-market societies were embedded in other, non-economic social institutions such as kinship, religion and political relations. He therefore critiqued the formalist economic modelling of Rostow. He was the author of \"Growth without development: An economic survey of Liberia\" (1966, with Robert W. Clower) and \"Economic Anthropology and Development: Essays on Tribal and Peasant Economies\" (1971).\n\nDependency theory arose as a theory in Latin America in reaction to modernization theory. It argues that resources flow from a \"periphery\" of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the \"World-system\" and hence poor countries will not follow Rostow's predicted path of modernization. Dependency theory rejected Rostow's view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and structures of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy and hence unable to change the system. \n\nImmanuel Wallerstein's \"world-systems theory\" was the version of Dependency theory that most North American anthropologists engaged with. His theories are similar to Dependency theory, although he placed more emphasis on the system as system, and focused on the developments of the core rather than periphery. Wallerstein also provided an historical account of the development of capitalism which had been missing from Dependency theory.\n\nWomen in development (WID) is an approach to development projects that emerged in the 1970s, calling for treatment of women's issues in development projects. Later, the Gender and development (GAD) approach proposed more emphasis on gender relations rather than seeing women's issues in isolation. The WID school grew out of the pioneering work of Esther Boserup. Boserup's most notable book is \"The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure\". This book presents a \"dynamic analysis embracing all types of primitive agriculture.\" Drawing on Boserup, the WID theorists pointed out that the division of labour in agriculture is frequently gendered, and that in societies practicing shifting cultivation, it is women who conduct most of the agricultural work. Development projects, however, were skewed towards men on the assumption they were \"heads of households.\"\n\nA major critique of development from anthropologists came from Arturo Escobar's seminal book \"Encountering Development\", which argued that Western development largely exploited non-Western peoples. Arturo Escobar views international development as a means for the Occident to keep control over the resources of its former colonies. Escobar shows that between 1945 and 1960, while the former colonies were going through decolonization, development plans helped to maintain the third world's dependency on the old metropole. Development projects themselves flourished in the wake of WWII, and during the cold war, when they were developed to \n\n1. stop the spread of Communism with the spread of capitalist markets; and \n\n2. create more prosperity for the West and its products by creating a global consumer demand for finished Western products abroad. \n\nSome scholars blame the different agents for having only considered a small aspect of the local people's lives without analyzing broader consequences, while others like dependency theory or Escobar argue that development projects are doomed to failure for the fundamental ways they privilege Western industry and corporations. Escobar's argument echos the earlier work of dependency theory and follows a larger critique more recently posed by Foucault an other poststructuralists.\n\nAt a critical juncture in the early nineteenth century the state began to connect itself to a series of groups “that in different ways had long tried to shape and administer the lives of individuals in pursuit of various goals” rather than simply extend the absolutist state’s repressive machinery of social control. Michel Foucault’s work on the prison, the clinic, and the asylum – on the development of “bio-power” – analyzed the plurality of governing agencies and authorities who developed programs, strategies, and technologies that were deployed to optimize the health, welfare and life of populations. He referred to this process with the neologism, “governmentality” (governmental rationality). One of the last of these new applied sciences was the \"development apparatus\", the post-world war extension of colonial rule after the independence of third world states.\nJames Ferguson utilized the governmentality framework in \"The Anti-Politics Machine: \"Development,\" Depoliticization and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho\" (1990), the first in many similar explorations. Ferguson sought to explore how \"development discourse\" works. That is, how do the language and practices used by development specialists influence the ways in which development is delivered, and what unintended consequences does it foster. He found that development projects which failed in their own terms could be redefined as \"successes\" on which new projects were to be modelled. The net effect of development, he found, was to \"de-politicize\" questions of resource allocation, and to strengthen bureaucratic power. In his analysis of a development project in Lesotho (South Africa) between 1978 and 1982, he examined the following discursive maneuvers. \n\nFerguson points out that a critical part of the development process is the way in which the object of development is defined. In defining this object, it is severed from its historical and geographic context, and isolated as a \"Less-Developed Country.\" In the case of Lesotho, its history as a grain exporting region was ignored, as was its current role as a labour reserve for the South African mines. Not wanting to deal with the apartheid South African regime, development agencies isolated the \"independent\" Lesotho from the regional economy in which it was entrapped in their project rationales and reports. Artificially taken out of this larger capitalist context, Lesotho's economy was described as \"isolated,\" \"non-market\" and \"traditional\" and thus a proper target for aid intervention.\n\nFerguson underscores that these discourses are produced within institutional settings where they must provide a charter for governmental intervention. Any analysis which suggests the roots of poverty lie in areas outside the scope of government are quickly dismissed and discarded since they cannot provide a rationale for state action. And since the capitalist economy is one such area which has been ideologically set outside the scope of governmental action, the discursive creation of a deformed ‘native economy’ creates the required opening for that intervention.\n\nFerguson writes that it is not enough to note development's failures; even the project managers initially recognized it as a failure. If that was all Ferguson had done, his book would not have had the influence it did. Asking if development is a failure is asking the wrong question; it ignores the “instrument effects” of what the projects DO do. In other words, we should ask what NON-economic functions does development serve? His answer:\n\nEcogovernmentality, (or Eco-governmentality), is the application of Foucault’s concepts of biopower and governmentality to the analysis of the regulation of social interactions with the natural world. The concept of Ecogovernmentality expands on Foucault’s genealogical examination of the state to include ecological rationalities and technologies of government. Following Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how government agencies, in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct “The Environment.” This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government’s larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.\n\nWork done by Arun Agrawal on local forest governance in India, is an example of this method of analysis. He illustrates how the production of specific types of expert knowledge (the economic productivity of forests) coupled with specific technologies of government (local Forest Stewardship Councils) can bring individual interest in line with those of the state. This, not through the imposition of specific outcomes, but by creating frameworks that rationalizes behavior in particular ways and involve individuals in the process of problem definition and intervention.\n\nThe term \"Green Revolution\" was first used in 1968 by former United States Agency for International Development (USAID) director William Gaud, who noted the spread of the new technologies:\n\"These and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the makings of a new revolution. It is not a violent Red Revolution like that of the Soviets, nor is it a White Revolution like that of the Shah of Iran. I call it the Green Revolution.\"\n\n\n"}

Of these references the most important are, perhaps, Strabo v.3.12; Ovid, \"Fasti\", 263-272; and Suetonius, \"Caligula\" 35, whose wording indicates that the old-world custom was dying out in the 1st century AD.

The bedtime story has long been considered \"a definite institution in many families\".\n\nReading bedtime stories yields multiple benefits for parents and children alike. The fixed routine of a bedtime story before sleeping can improve the child's brain development, language mastery, and logical thinking skills. The storyteller-listener relationship creates an emotional bond between the parent and the child. Due to \"the strength of the imitative instinct\" of a child, the parent and the stories that they tell act as a model for the child to follow.\n\nBedtime stories are also useful for teaching the child abstract virtues such as sympathy, unselfishness, and self-control, as most children are said to be \"naturally sympathetic when they have experienced or can imagine the feelings of others\". Thus, bedtime stories can be used to discuss darker subjects such as death and racism. As the bedtime stories broaden in theme, the child \"will broaden in their conception of the lives and feelings of others\".\n"}

It is derived from Einstein's mass-energy equivalency and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and is \"c\"/\"h\" ≈ 1.36 × 10 bits per second per kilogram. This value is important when designing cryptographic algorithms, as it can be used to determine the minimum size of encryption keys or hash values required to create an algorithm that could never be cracked by a brute-force search.\n\nFor example, a computer with the mass of the entire Earth operating at the Bremermann's limit could perform approximately 10 mathematical computations per second. If one assumes that a cryptographic key can be tested with only one operation, then a typical 128-bit key could be cracked in under 10 seconds. However, a 256-bit key (which is already in use in some systems) would take about two minutes to crack. Using a 512-bit key would increase the cracking time to approaching 10 years, without increasing the time for encryption by more than a constant factor (depending on the encryption algorithms used).\n\nThe limit has been further analysed in later literature as the maximum rate at which a system with energy spread formula_1 can evolve into an orthogonal and hence distinguishable state to another, formula_2. In particular, Margolus and Levitin has shown that a quantum system with average energy E takes at least time formula_3 to evolve into an orthogonal state.\nHowever, it has been shown that access to quantum memory enables computational algorithms that require arbitrarily small amount of energy/time per one elementary computation step.\n\n\n"}

It is also home to a study centre open to the general public. The CCA also provides educational programs and cultural activities.\n\nThe CCA also has an architectural garden located on the southern side of René-Lévesque Boulevard. The sculpture garden was realized by architect Melvin Charney.\n\nThe CCA was founded in 1979 by Montreal architect Phyllis Lambert. The purpose of the centre was to promote public awareness of the role architecture plays in society, as well as to encourage scholarly architectural research and to foster innovative design practices.\n\nThe CCA was designed and constructed between 1985 and 1989 by Montreal architect Peter Rose. The design of the museum incorporates the Shaughnessy House mansion, built for Thomas Shaughnessy, a Second Empire-style mansion that Lambert purchased in 1974 to prevent its demolition.\n\nThe CCA received the \"Honor Awards for Architecture|Honor Award for Architecture\" from the American Institute of Architects and the Governor General's Medals in Architecture in 1992.\n\nThe current building, which opened in 1989, surrounds Shaughnessy House and was designed by Peter Rose, in collaboration with Phyllis Lambert and Erol Argun.\n\nShaughnessy House, located at 1923 Dorchester St. W (today René-Lévesque Boulevard) was at built in 1874 according to plans by William Tutin Thomas.

It could be molded to the shape of the body, forming a type of shell. After the material dried it could be painted or gilded. The shell could be decorated with geometric shapes, deities, and inscriptions. During the Ptolemaic era, the single shell method was altered to include four to six pieces of cartonnage. There would generally be a mask, pectoral, apron, and foot casing. In certain instances there were two additional pieces used to cover the ribcage and stomach.\n\nThe materials used to produce cartonnage changed over time. In the Middle Kingdom it was common to use plastered linen, during the Third Intermediate Period, linen and stucco, during the Ptolemaic period, old papyrus scrolls and during the Roman period, thicker fibrous materials. \n\nReusing papyrus that was considered waste was a common practice during the Ptolemaic period.

{"id": "921126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=921126", "title": "Charge (heraldry)", "text": "Charge (heraldry)\n\nIn heraldry, a charge is any emblem or device occupying the field of an \"escutcheon\" (shield). This may be a geometric design (sometimes called an \"ordinary\") or a symbolic representation of a person, animal, plant, object or other device. In French blazon, the ordinaries are called \"pièces\" while other charges are called \"meubles\" (\"i.e.\" \"[the] mobile [ones]\").\n\nThe term \"charge\" can also be used as a verb; for example, if an escutcheon depicts three lions, then it is said to be \"charged with three lions;\" similarly, a crest or even a charge itself may be \"charged\", such as a pair of eagle wings \"charged with trefoils\" (e.g. Coat of arms of Brandenburg). It is important to distinguish between the ordinaries and divisions of the field, as these typically follow similar patterns, such as a shield \"divided\" \"per chevron\", as distinct from being \"charged with\" a chevron.\n\nWhile thousands of objects found in nature, mythology or technology have appeared in armory, there are several charges (such as the cross, the eagle and the lion) which have contributed to the distinctive flavour of heraldic design. Only these and a few other notable charges (crowns, stars, keys, etc.) are discussed in this article, but a more exhaustive list will be found at List of heraldic charges.\n\nIn addition to being shown in the regular way charges may be \"umbrated\" (this is to be distinguished from them being blazoned as \"detailed\" highly unusual description of them as being \"shaded\", and are rather irregularly sometimes stated to be \"in silhouette\" or are, more ambiguously, confusingly and unhelpfully, blazoned as \"futuristic\", \"stylized\" or \"simplified\". There are also several units in the United States Air Force with charges blazoned as \"mythical\", although this conception is meaningless and irrelevant to the conception of heraldry; neither does it affect the appearance of these charges.\n\nSome heraldic writers distinguish, albeit arbitrarily, between \"honourable ordinaries\" and \"sub-ordinaries\". While some authors hold that only nine charges are \"honourable\" ordinaries, exactly which ones fit into this category is a subject of constant disagreement. The remainder are often termed \"sub-ordinaries\", and narrower or smaller versions of the ordinaries are called \"diminutives\". While the term \"ordinaries\" is generally recognised, so much dispute may be found among sources regarding which are \"honourable\" and which are relegated to the category of \"sub-ordinaries\" that indeed one of the leading authors in the field, Arthur Charles Fox-Davies (1871–1928), wrote at length on what he calls the \"utter absurdity of the necessity for any [such] classification at all,\" stating that the ordinaries and sub-ordinaries are, in his mind, \"no more than first charges.\" Apparently ceding the point for the moment, Fox-Davies lists the generally agreed-upon \"honourable ordinaries\" as the bend, fess, pale, pile, chevron, cross, saltire and chief. Woodcock sheds some light on the matter, stating that earlier writers such as Leigh, Holme and Guillim proposed that \"honourable ordinaries\" should occupy one-third of the field, while later writers such as Edmondson favoured one-fifth, \"on the grounds that a bend, pale, or chevron occupying one-third of the field makes the coat look clumsy and disagreeable.\" Woodcock goes so far as to enumerate the ordinaries thus: \"The first Honourable Ordinary is the cross,\" the second is the chief, the third is the pale, the fourth is the bend, the fifth is the fess, the sixth is the inescutcheon, the seventh is the chevron, the eighth is the saltire, and the ninth is the bar, while stating that \"some writers\" prefer the bordure as the ninth ordinary. Volborth, having decidedly less to say on the matter, agrees that the classifications are arbitrary and the subject of disagreement, and lists the \"definite\" ordinaries as the chief, pale, bend, fess, chevron, cross and saltire. Boutell lists the chief, pale, bend, bend sinister, fess, bar, cross, saltire and chevron as the \"honourable ordinaries\". Thus, the chief, bend, pale, fess, chevron, cross and saltire appear to be the undisputed ordinaries, while authors disagree over the status of the pile, bar, inescutcheon, bordure and others.\n\nSeveral different figures are recognised as \"honourable ordinaries\", each normally occupying about one-fifth to one-third of the field. As discussed above, much disagreement exists among authors regarding which ordinary charges are \"honourable\", so only those generally agreed to be \"honourable ordinaries\" will be discussed here, while the remainder of ordinary charges will be discussed in the following section.\n\n\nMost of the ordinaries have corresponding \"diminutives\", narrower versions, most often mentioned when two or more appear in parallel: \"bendlets, pallets, bars\" (multiples of the \"fess\"), \"chevronels\".\n\nIn addition to those mentioned in the above section, other ordinaries exist. Some of these are variously called \"honourable ordinaries\" by different authors, while others of these are often called \"sub-ordinaries\".\n\n\nSo-called \"mobile charges\" are not tied to the size and shape of the shield, and so may be placed in any part of the field, although whenever a charge appears alone, it is placed with sufficient position and size to occupy the entire field. Common mobile charges include human figures, human parts, animals, animal parts, mythical creatures (or \"monsters\"), plants and floral designs, inanimate objects, and other devices. The heraldic animals need not exactly resemble the actual creatures.\n\nA number of geometric charges are sometimes listed among the subordinaries (see above), but as their form is not related to the shape of the shield – indeed they may appear independent of the shield (\"i.e.\" in crests and badges) – they are more usefully considered here. These include the escutcheon or inescutcheon, lozenge, fusil, mascle, rustre, billet, roundel, fountain, and annulet.\n\nSeveral other simple charges occur with comparable frequency. These include the mullet or star, crescent and cross.\n\nOne of the most frequently found charges in heraldry, if not \"the\" most, is the \"cross\", which has developed into, some say, 400 varieties. When the cross does not reach the edges of the field, it becomes a mobile charge. The plain \"Greek cross\" (with equal limbs) and \"Latin cross\" (with the lower limb extended) are sometimes seen, but more often the tip of each limb is developed into some ornamental shape. The most commonly found crosses in heraldry include the \"cross botonny\", the \"cross flory\", the \"cross moline\", the \"cross potent\", the \"cross patée\" or \"formée\", the \"cross patonce\" and the \"cross crosslet\".\n\nIn English heraldry the crescent, mullet, martlet, annulet, fleur-de-lis and rose may be added to a shield to distinguish cadet branches of a family from the senior line. It does not follow, however, that a shield containing such a charge necessarily belongs to a cadet branch. All of these charges occur frequently in basic (\"undifferenced\") coats of arms.\n\nHumans, deities, angels and demons occur more often as crests and supporters than on the shield. When humans do appear on the shield, they almost always appear \"affronté\" (facing forward), rather than toward the left like beasts. The largest group of human charges consists of saints, often as the patron of a town. Knights, bishops, monks and nuns, kings and queens also occur frequently. There are rare occurrences of a \"child\" (without further description, this is usually understood to be a very young boy, and young girls are extremely rare in heraldry), both the head and entire body. A famous example is the child swallowed by a dragon (the biscione) in the arms of Visconti dukes of Milan.\n\nGreco-Roman mythological figures typically appear in an allegorical or canting role. Angels very frequently appear, but angelic beings of higher rank, such as cherubim and seraphim, are extremely rare. An archangel appears in the arms of Arkhangelsk. The Devil or a demon is occasionally seen, being defeated by the archangel Saint Michael. Though the taboo is not invariably respected, British heraldry in particular, and to a greater or lesser extent the heraldry of other countries, frowns on depictions of God or Christ, though an exception may be in the not-uncommon Continental depictions of Madonna and Child, including the Black Madonna in the arms of Marija Bistrica, Croatia.\n\nMoors—or more frequently their heads, often crowned—appear with some frequency in medieval European heraldry. The term ascribed to them in Anglo-Norman is \"maure\", though they are also sometimes called \"moore\", \"blackmoor\", \"negro\" or occasionally \"savage\". Maures appear in European heraldry from at least as early as the 13th century, and some have been attested as early as the 11th century in Italy, where they have persisted in the local heraldry and vexillology well into modern times in Corsica and Sardinia. Armigers bearing moors or moors' heads may have adopted them for any of several reasons, to include symbolizing military victories in the Crusades, as a pun on the bearer's name in the canting arms of Morese, Negri, Saraceni, etc., or in the case of Frederick II, possibly to demonstrate the reach of his empire. Even the arms of Pope Benedict XVI feature a moor's head, crowned and collared red. Nevertheless, the use of moors (and particularly their heads) as a heraldic symbol has been deprecated in modern North America, where racial stereotypes have been influenced by a history of Trans-Atlantic slave trade and racial segregation, and applicants to the College of Arms of the Society for Creative Anachronism are urged to use them delicately to avoid creating offensive images.\n\nParts of human bodies occur more often than the whole, particularly heads (occasionally of exotic nationality), hearts (always stylized), hands, torso and armored limbs. A famous heraldic hand is the Red Hand of Ulster, alluding to an incident in the legendary Milesian invasion. Hands also appear in the coat of arms of Antwerp. Ribs occur in Iberian armory, canting for the Portuguese family \"da Costa\". According to Woodward & Burnett, the Counts Colleoni of Milan bear arms blazoned: \"Per pale argent and gules, three hearts reversed counterchanged;\" but in less delicate times these were read as canting arms showing three pairs of testicles (\"coglioni\" = \"testicles\" in Italian). The community of Cölbe in Hesse has a coat of arms with a similar charge.\n\nAnimals, especially lions and eagles, feature prominently as heraldic charges. Some differences may be observed between an animal's natural form and the conventional attitudes (positions) into which heraldic animals are contorted; additionally, various parts of an animal (claws, horns, tongue, etc.) may be differently coloured, each with its own terminology. Most animals are broadly classified, according to their natural form, into beasts, birds, sea creatures and others, and the attitudes that apply to them may be grouped accordingly. Beasts, particularly lions, most often appear in the \"rampant\" position; while birds, particularly the eagle, most often appear \"displayed\". While the lion, regarded as the king of beasts, is by far the most frequently occurring beast in heraldry, the eagle, equally regarded as the king of birds, is overwhelmingly the most frequently occurring bird, and the rivalry between these two is often noted to parallel with the political rivalry between the powers they came to represent in medieval Europe. Neubecker notes that \"in the heroic poem by Heinrich von Veldeke based on the story of Aeneas, the bearer of the arms of a lion is set against the bearer of the arms of an eagle. If one takes the latter to be the historical and geographical forerunner of the Holy Roman emperor, then the bearer of the lion represents the unruly feudal lords, to whom the emperor had to make more and more concessions, particularly to the powerful duke of Bavaria and Saxony, Henry the Lion of the House of Welf.\"\n\nThe beast most often portrayed in heraldry is the lion. When posed \"passant guardant\" (walking and facing the viewer), he is called a \"léopard\" in French blazon. Other beasts frequently seen include the wolf, bear, boar, horse, bull or ox, and stag or hart. The \"tiger\" (unless blazoned as a \"Bengal tiger\") is a fanciful beast with a wolflike body, a mane and a pointed snout. Dogs of various types, and occasionally of specific breeds, occur more often as crests or supporters than as charges. According to Neubecker, heraldry in the Middle Ages generally distinguished only between pointers, hounds and whippets, when any distinction was made. The unicorn resembles a horse with a single horn, but its hooves are usually cloven like those of a deer. The griffin combines the head (but with ears), chest, wings and forelegs of the eagle with the hindquarters and legs of a lion. The \"male griffin\" lacks wings and his body is scattered with spikes.\n\nThe bird most frequently found in armory is, by far, the eagle. Eagles in heraldry are predominantly presented with one or two heads, though triple-headed eagles are not unknown, and one eagle appearing in the Codex Manesse curiously has its wing bones fashioned into additional heads. Eagles and their wings also feature prominently as crests. Eagles most frequently appear full-bodied, with one head, in numerous positions including \"displayed\", \"statant\", \"passant\" and \"rising\". The \"demi-eagle\", which is shown only from the waist up, occurs less frequently. Double-headed eagles almost always appear \"displayed\". As a result of being the dominant charge on the imperial Byzantine, Holy Roman, Austrian and Russian coats of arms, the double eagle gained enduring renown throughout the Western world. Among the present day nations with an eagle charge on their coat of arms are: Albania, Austria, Germany, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Serbia. Additionally, the \"Double-Headed Eagle of Lagash\" is used as an emblem by the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. There are many meanings attached to this symbol, and it was introduced in France in the early 1760s as the emblem of the Knight Kadosh degree.\n\nThe martlet, a stylized swallow without feet (sometimes incorrectly, at least in the Anglophone heraldries these days, said to have no beak), is a mark of cadency in English heraldry, but also appears as a simple charge in undifferenced arms. The pelican is notable as frequently occurring in a peculiar attitude described as \"in her piety\" (\"i.e.\" wings raised, piercing her own breast to feed her chicks in the nest, which is how it is actually often blazoned, 'in its piety' being a fairly modern conceit). This symbol carries a particular religious meaning, and became so popular in heraldry that pelicans rarely exist in heraldry in any other position. Distinction is however observed, between a pelican \"vulning herself\" (alone, piercing her breast) and \"in her piety\" (surrounded by and feeding her chicks). The swan is also often seen, and the peacock in heraldry is described as being \"in its pride\". Other birds occur less frequently.\n\nThe category of sea creatures may be seen to include various fish, a highly stylized \"dolphin\", and various fanciful creatures, sea monsters, which are shown as half-fish and half-beast, as well as mermaids and the like. The \"sea lion\" and \"sea horse\", for example, do not appear as natural sea lions and seahorses, but rather as half-lion half-fish and half-horse half-fish, respectively. Fish of various species often appear in canting arms, e.g.: pike, also called luce, for Pike or Lucy; dolphin (a conventional kind of fish rather than the natural mammal) for the Dauphin de Viennois. The \"escallop\" (scallop shell) became popular as a token of pilgrimage to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela. The \"sea-lion\" and \"sea-horse\", like the mermaid, combine the foreparts of a mammal with the tail of a fish, and a dorsal fin in place of the mane. (When the natural seahorse is meant, it is blazoned as a \"hippocampus\".) The \"sea-dog\" and \"sea-wolf\" are quadrupeds but with scales, webbed feet, and often a flat tail resembling that of the beaver.\n\nReptiles and invertebrates occurring in heraldry include serpents, lizards, salamanders and others, but the most frequently occurring of these are various forms of dragons. The \"dragon\", thus termed, is a large monstrous reptile with, often, a forked or barbed tongue, membraned wings like a bat's, and four legs. The \"wyvern\" and \"lindworm\" are dragons with only two legs. The salamander is typically shown as a simple lizard surrounded by flames. Also notably occurring (undoubtedly owing much of its fame to Napoleon, though it also appears in much earlier heraldry) is the bee.\n\nAnimals' heads are also very frequent charges, as are the paw or leg (\"gamb\") of the lion, the wing (often paired) of the eagle, and the antlers (\"attire\") of the stag. Sometimes only the top half of a beast is shown; for example, the \"demi-lion\" is among the most common forms occurring in heraldic crests.\n\nHeads may appear \"cabossed\" (also \"caboshed\" or \"caboched\"): with the head cleanly separated from the neck so that only the face shows; \"couped\": with the neck cleanly separated from the body so that the whole head and neck are present; or \"erased\": with the neck showing a ragged edge as if forcibly torn from the body. While cabossed heads are shown facing forward (\"affronté\"), heads that are \"couped\" or \"erased\" face dexter unless otherwise specified for differencing. Heads of horned beasts are often shown cabossed to display the horns, but instances can be found in any of these circumstances. A lion's head cabossed is called simply a \"face\", and a fox's head cabossed, a \"mask\".\n\nThe \"attitude\", or position, of the creature's body is usually explicitly stated in English blazon. When such description is omitted, a lion can be assumed to be \"rampant\", a leopard or herbivore \"passant\".\n\nBy default, the charge faces dexter (left as seen by the viewer); this would be forward on a shield worn on the left arm. In German armory, animate charges in the dexter half of a composite display are usually turned to face the center.\n\n\nCertain features of an animal are often of a contrasting tincture. The charge is then said to be \"armed\" (claws and horns and tusks), \"langued\" (tongue), \"vilené\" or \"pizzled\" (penis), \"attired\" (antlers or very occasionally horns), \"unguled\" (hooves), \"crined\" (horse's mane or human hair) of a specified tincture.\n\nMany attitudes have developed from the herald's imagination and ever-increasing need for differentiation, but only the principal attitudes found in heraldry need be discussed here. These, in the case of beasts, include the erect positions, the seated positions, and the prone positions. In the case of birds, these include the \"displayed\" positions, the flying positions, and the resting positions. Additionally, birds are frequently described by the position of their wings. A few other attitudes warrant discussion, including those particular to fish, serpents, griffins and dragons.\n\nThe principal attitude of beasts is \"rampant\" (\"i.e.\" standing on one hind leg with forepaws raised as if to strike). Beasts also frequently appear walking, \"passant\" or, in the case of stags and the occasional unicorn, \"trippant\", and may appear \"statant\" (standing), \"salient\" or \"springing\" (leaping), \"sejant\" (seated), \"couchant\" or \"lodged\" (lying prone with head raised), or occasionally \"dormant\" (sleeping). The principal attitude of birds, namely the eagle, is \"displayed\" (\"i.e.\" facing the viewer with the head turned toward dexter and wings raised and upturned to show the full underside of both wings). Birds also appear \"rising\" or \"rousant\" (\"i.e.\" wings raised and head upturned as if about to take flight), \"volant\" (flying), \"statant\" (standing, with wings raised), \"close\" (at rest with wings folded), and waterfowl may appear \"naiant\" (swimming), while cranes may appear \"vigilant\" (standing on one leg). Fish often appear \"naiant\" (swimming horizontally) or \"hauriant\" (upwards) or \"urinant\" (downwards), but may also appear \"addorsed\" (two fish hauriant, back to back). Serpents may appear \"glissant\" (gliding in a wavy form) or \"nowed\" (as a figure-eight knot). Griffins and quadrupedal dragons constantly appear \"segreant\" (\"i.e.\" rampant with wings addorsed and elevated) and, together with lions, may appear \"combatant\" (\"i.e.\" two of them turned to face each other in the rampant position).\n\nPlants are extremely common in heraldry and figure among the earliest charges. The turnip, for instance, makes an early appearance, as does wheat. Trees also appear in heraldry; the most frequent tree by far is the oak (drawn with large leaves and acorns), followed by the pine. Apples and bunches of grapes occur very frequently, other fruits less so. When the fruit is mentioned, as to indicate a different tincture, the tree is said to be \"fructed\" of the tincture. If a tree is \"eradicated\" it is shown as if it has been ripped up from the ground, the roots being exposed. \"Erased\" is rarely used for a similar treatment. In Portuguese heraldry, but rarely in other countries, trees are sometimes found decorticated.\n\nThe most famous heraldic flower (particularly in French heraldry) is the \"fleur-de-lis\", which is often stated to be a stylised lily, though despite the name there is considerable debate on this. The \"natural\" lily, somewhat stylised, also occurs, as (together with the fleur-de-lis) in the arms of Eton College. The rose is perhaps even more widely seen in English heraldry than the fleur-de-lis. Its heraldic form is derived from the \"wild\" type with only five petals, and it is often \"barbed\" (the hull of the bud, its points showing between the petals) and \"seeded\" in contrasting tinctures. The thistle frequently appears as a symbol of Scotland.\n\nThe trefoil, quatrefoil and cinquefoil are abstract forms resembling flowers or leaves. The trefoil is always shown \"slipped\" (i.e. with a stem), unless blazoned otherwise. The cinquefoil is sometimes blazoned \"fraise\" (strawberry flower), most notably when canting for Fraser. The trillium flower occurs occasionally in a Canadian context, and the protea flower constantly appears in South Africa, since it is the national flower symbol.\n\nWheat constantly occurs in the form of \"garbs\" or sheaves and in fields (e.g. in the arms of the province of Alberta, Canada), though less often as ears, which are shown unwhiskered (though some varieties of wheat are naturally whiskered). Ears of rye are depicted exactly as wheat, except the ears droop down and are often whiskered. Barley, cannabis, maize, and oats also occur. The \"garb\" in the arms of Gustav Vasa (and in the Coat of Arms of Sweden) is not a wheatsheaf, although it was pictured in that way from the 16th to 19th century; rather, this \"vasa\" is a bundle but of unknown sort.\n\nVery few inanimate objects in heraldry carry a special significance distinct from that of the object itself, but among such objects are the \"escarbuncle\", the \"fasces\", and the \"key\". The escarbuncle developed from the radiating iron bands used to strengthen a round shield, eventually becoming a heraldic charge. The fasces (not to be confused with the French term for a \"bar\" or \"fess\") is emblematic of the Roman magisterial office and has often been granted to mayors. Keys (taking a form similar to a \"skeleton key\") are emblematic of Saint Peter and, by extension, the papacy, and thus frequently appear in ecclesiastical heraldry. Because St. Peter is the patron saint of fishermen, keys also notably appear in the arms of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers.\n\nThe sun is a disc with twelve or more wavy rays, or alternating wavy and straight rays, often represented \"in his splendour\" (\"i.e.\" with a face). The moon \"in her plenitude\" (full) sometimes appears, distinguished from a \"roundel argent\" by having a face; but crescents occur much more frequently. \"Estoiles\" are stars with six wavy rays, while \"stars\" (when they occur under that name) have straight rays usually numbering five in British and North American heraldry and six in continental European heraldry. Clouds often occur, though more frequently for people or animals to stand on or issue from than as isolated charges. The raindrop as such is unknown, though a drop of fluid (\"goutte\") is known. These occasionally appear as a charge, but more frequently constitute a field semé (known as \"goutté\"). The snowflake occurs in modern heraldry, sometimes blazoned as a \"snow crystal\" or \"ice crystal\".\n\nThe oldest geological charge is the \"mount\", typically a green hilltop rising from the lower edge of the field, providing a place for a beast, building or tree to stand. This feature is exceedingly common in Hungarian arms. Natural mountains and boulders are not unknown, though ranges of mountains are differently shown. An example is the arms of Edinburgh, portraying Edinburgh Castle atop Castle Rock. Volcanos are shown, almost without exception, as erupting, and the eruption is generally quite stylised. In the 18th century, \"landscapes\" began to appear in armory, often depicting the sites of battles. For example, Admiral Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson received a chief of augmentation containing a landscape alluding to the Battle of the Nile.\n\nBy far the most frequent building in heraldry is the \"tower\", a tapering cylinder of masonry topped with battlements, usually having a door and a few windows. The canting arms of the Kingdom of Castile are \"Gules, a tower triple-turreted Or\" (\"i.e.\" three small towers standing atop a larger one). A castle is generally shown as two towers joined by a wall, the doorway often shown secured by a portcullis. The portcullis was used as a canting badge by the House of Tudor (\"two-doors\"), and has since come to represent the British Parliament. The modern chess-rook would be indistinguishable from a tower; the heraldic chess rook, based on the medieval form of the piece, instead of battlements, has two outward-splayed \"horns\". Civic and ecclesiastical armory sometimes shows a church or a whole town, and cities, towns and Scots burghs often bear a mural crown (a crown in the form of a wall with battlements or turrets) in place of a crown over the shield. Ships of various types often appear; the most frequent being the ancient galley often called, from the Gaelic, a lymphad. Also frequent are anchors and oars.\n\nThe \"maunch\" is a 12th-century lady's sleeve style. Its use in heraldry arose from the custom of the knights who attended tournaments wearing their ladies sleeves, as \"gages d'amour\" (tokens of love). This fashion of sleeve would later evolve into Tippet-style stoles. In French blazon this charge is sometimes informally referred to as \"manche mal taillée\" (a sleeve badly cut).\n\nSpurs also occur, sometimes \"winged\", but more frequently occurring is the \"spur-rowel\" or \"spur-revel\", which is said to more often termed a \"mullet of five points pierced\" by English heralds.\n\nCrowns and coronets of various kinds are constantly seen. The ecclesiastical hat and bishop's mitre are nearly ubiquitous in ecclesiastical heraldry. The sword is sometimes a symbol of authority, as in the royal arms of the Netherlands, but may also allude to Saint Paul, as the patron of a town (e.g. London) or dedicatee of a church. Sometimes it is shown with a key, owing to the fact that Saints Peter and Paul are paired together. Other weapons occur more often in modern than in earlier heraldry. The mace also appears as a weapon, the war mace, in addition to its appearance as a symbol of authority, plain mace. The \"globus cruciger\", also variously called an \"orb\", a \"royal orb\", or a \"mound\" (from French \"monde\", Latin \"mundus\", the world) is a ball or globe surmounted by a cross, which is part of the regalia of an emperor or king, and is the emblem of sovereign authority and majesty.\n\nBooks constantly occur, most frequently in the arms of colleges and universities, though the Gospel and Bible are sometimes distinguished. Books if open may be inscribed with words. Words and phrases are otherwise rare, except in Spanish and Portuguese armory. Letters of the various alphabets are also relatively rare. Arms of merchants in Poland and eastern Germany are often based on house marks, abstract symbols resembling runes, though they are almost never blazoned as runes, but as combinations of other heraldic charges. Musical instruments commonly seen are the harp (as in the coat of arms of Ireland), bell and trumpet. The drum, almost without exception, is of the field drum type. Since musical notation is a comparatively recent invention, it is not found in early heraldry, though it does appear in 20th century heraldry.\n\nJapanese mon are sometimes used as heraldic charges. They are blazoned in traditional heraldic style rather than in the Japanese style.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4259402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4259402", "title": "Composition studies", "text": "Composition studies\n\nComposition studies (also referred to as composition and rhetoric, rhetoric and composition, writing studies, or simply composition) is the professional field of writing, research, and instruction, focusing especially on writing at the college level in the United States. In many American colleges and universities, undergraduate students must take freshman—sometimes even higher—composition courses. \n\nOver seventy American universities offer doctoral study in rhetoric and composition, programs which usually include study of composition pedagogical theory, research methodologies in rhetoric and composition, and the history of rhetoric. Many composition scholars study not only the theory and practice of post-secondary writing instruction, but also the influence of different writing conventions and genres on writers' composing processes. Composition scholars also publish in the fields of teaching English as a second or foreign language (TESOL), writing centers, and new literacies.\n\nMost US universities have a required first-year composition course, also referred to as FYC. This is not the same as a literature course, which focuses on literary analysis and interpretation, although some colleges and universities do incorporate literature and other humanities into their composition courses; often, however, composition courses offer intensive instruction in writing non-fiction, expository texts using academic discourse conventions. Writing curricula vary considerably from institution to institution, but it may emphasize many stages of different writing processes (invention or brainstorming, drafting, revision, editing, proofreading), different forms of writing (narration, exposition, description, argumentation, comparison and contrast), different portions of the written product (introductions, conclusions, thesis statements, presentation and documentation of forms of evidence, inclusion of quotations, etc.), along with different modalities of composing to expand the concept of 'writing'. Pedagogies or approaches to teaching writing are grounded in a range of different traditions and philosophies.\n\nSome universities require further instruction in writing and offer courses that expand upon the skills developed in First-year composition. Second level or advanced composition may emphasize forms of argumentation and persuasion, digital media, research and source documentation formats, and/or genres of writing across a range of disciplines and genres (see below). For example, the skills required to write business letters or annual reports will differ significantly from those required to write historical or scientific research or personal memoirs.\n\nDoctoral programs in Composition Studies are available at more than seventy universities and Masters's programs are available in over 170 universities. Such programs are commonly housed within English Studies or Education programs. However, recently there are an increasing number of departments specifically dedicated to this field of study (e.g. Composition Studies, Writing & Rhetoric, Composition & Linguistics, etc.).\n\nSecond language writing is the practice of teaching English composition to non native speakers and writers of English. Teaching writing to ESL students does not receive much attention because even in ESL classes teachers focus on speaking, listening and reading, not just writing. Paul Kei Matsuda in his article \"Situating ESL Writing in a Cross-Disciplinary Context\" stresses the importance of teaching writing specifically with understanding the needs of ESL students to help them improve their writing. Teaching writing has progressed through several approaches during the history of education in the United States. ESL teachers might need to explore common methods which are the cognitive, social and expressive theories to create an approach that meets the needs of ESL writers and help them to overcome their difficulties.\n\nThe first one of these approaches is the cognitive view which says that writing is progressing from one stage to another in a series of single steps. That means \"good\" writing is a planned process, which includes planning, translating and reviewing. \"Understanding Composing\" by Sondra Perl explains in detail this approach. She suggests that the composition of writing occurs as a recursive process. She took this idea from her observation of different writers. She thinks that writers return to \"backwards\" parts of the process in order to move \"forward\" with the overall composition. ESL teachers may find this approach helpful at first in teaching beginning ESL students because at this level students do not have large amounts of vocabulary and grammar or knowledge of the style of essays which is the basis of writing English. Al-Buainain Haifa in her article \"Student Writing Errors in EFL,\" points out that, when a researcher asked ESL students by using a survey what they would like to have learned or learned better in their writing classes, they found that the largest percentages expressed specific needs in vocabulary and grammar (17). Many kinds of grammar make ESL students confused, especially because there are many exceptions. Because writing styles are different in different languages, ESL students need time to master them. Therefore, ESL teachers should find an effective way to teach ESL students vocabulary, grammar and style because the writing of English requires them. The cognitive approach can meet these needs because it emphasizes the steps, organization and process of writing.\n\nAnother approach is the social view which shows the importance of teaching writing by making students learn the different languages of discourse communities. This is what David Bartholomae emphasizes in his article \"Inventing the University\". He uses \"Inventing the University\" as a phrase that describes the writing process that a student will experience when writing teachers ask them to write about a topic that relates with a discourse community which is new for them. Discourse community can be thought of as members of an academic discipline or a select audience. When the ESL students have become good at grammar and style, they face a large problem when they enter their chosen academic field. Bartholomae in this article illustrates that each academic community has a particular language or vocabulary. The problem is that any academic field has its own language, even jargon, that differs from one to another. This problem is faced not only by ESL students, but all American students will struggle with this when they begin the first year of their academic life. The social approach can be used by ESL teachers as a second step but they should make sure that their students master the basics of English writing such as grammar and style.\n\nMoreover, the expressive view which is represented in Donald Murray's article \"Teach Writing as a Process Not Product\", allows for wittier creating and freer movement. It suggests three elements for \"good\" writing which are integrity, originality, and spontaneity. However, it is difficult to evaluate them in a paper. Therefore, these standards cannot be relied upon to judge writing. In addition, these elements are not the important elements that help to assess \"good\" writing. ESL teachers might use this approach but it can only be used for highly advanced ESL students. It is difficult to ask ESL students to write freely if they possess limited vocabulary or grammar. They need examples to help them which they can find in the cognitive approach.\n\nESL teachers may use these common ways of teaching writing, but they need first to understand their student's difficulties. Learning writing is one of the essential difficulties that ESL students find in studying English, especially since writing is important in an academic community. Some ESL students may need to jump from being a student who does not speak English ever to a student who uses academic language in a short time which may put a large burden on their shoulders. Hence, teaching writing to ESL students is different than teaching native speakers. ESL teachers need to choose an effective way to meet the needs of ESL students. It would be helpful if ESL teachers look at these different ways of teaching writing to see which one addresses ESL students' difficulties in the best way or if a combination of these theories may be better.\n\nWhile multicultural pedagogies are not specifically tied to second-language writing pedagogies, compositionists have often considered how students' cultural knowledge and use of idioms, dialects, and/or languages other than American Edited English (AEA) can enhance their instruction in English composition. For example, Maxine Hairston's \"Diversity, Ideology, and Teaching Writing\" advocates for students' expressivist writing to be central in a composition course, and believes students \"need to write to find out how much they know and to gain confidence in the ability to express themselves effectively\" (186). Hairston also believes that teachers can design writing assignments to encourage \"cross-cultural awareness\" (191). In addition, Beth Daniell's approach in \"Narratives of Literacy: Connecting College Composition to Culture\" describes how studies in \"little narratives [that] almost all examine literacy in particular local settings\" championed by scholars who \"seldom make theoretical statements that claim to be valid for literate cultures in general or literate cultures in general,\" which would allow students to engage in cultural critique (403). Aaron Schutz and Anne Ruggles Gere's article for \"College English\", \"Service Learning and English Studies,\" described how Schutz's course, while it was mainly focused in service learning and local activism, engaged students in collaborative research and writing surrounding campus-wide issues, such as an instance of racial discrimination that occurred in the local student union; this allowed students to engage in cultural awareness as well as cultural critique (129-39).\n\nFurthermore, In \"Empowering Education,\" Ira Shor delineates a pedagogy in which the teacher facilitates discussion of generative themes produced by the students, using the example of his basic writing course with working-class students at \"a low-budget college in New York City\" several decades ago (10). The Freirean approach for teaching literacy and writing that Shor reviews in \"Empowering Education\" demonstrates how the generative words manifested themselves \"[through] researching local issues and language in the students' communities. From the many linguistic and sociological items…the educators selected some key concerns—generative themes expressed through generative words\" (55). In this framework, teachers and students research these items collaboratively, and once students have presented their research on problems in their community, they may begin to decide how they might analyze and upend power structures or rhetorical situations that contribute to and exacerbate such issues. For Shor's classroom, \"[t]he generative themes [that have] emerg[ed]…from student culture have most often related to sex, abortion, drugs, family, education, careers, work, and the economic crisis\" (56). Shor believes it is important to allow students to build a basis for problem-posing upon their prior knowledge and experiences to make it multicultural.\n\nShor also reviews Paolo Freire's literacy project in Brazil as described in Freire's \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\", which enforces the idea that all people are creators of culture through visuals, oral discussion, and creation of word lists that are the basis for which the people begin to use language to express how the dominant culture operates, how their home culture operates, and how these systemic actions impact themselves and the world (Freire 87-124). In this way, both Freire and Shor believe problem-posing education can be situated in multicultural practices as well as critical literacy practices. Shor insists \"subject matter is best introduced as problems related to student experience, in language familiar to them\" (63).\n\nOverall, previous scholars' discussion of multiculturalism in the classroom seems to privilege \"cross-cultural interactions\" and valuing students' home languages as well as their cultural ideologies. However, in Donald Lazere's \"Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric\", Lazere criticizes Hairston, Daniell, Schutz, Gere, and other scholars for their approaches because of their singular focus on localism in lieu of more \"global\" and critical approaches to the study of culture in the composition classroom (152-153). In addition, Lazere was critical of scholars' tendency to diminish the power of Edited American English (EAE) and misrepresent the power of the students' regional code (116). While Lazere supports Shor's approach to multicultural critical pedagogy, he admits some level of discomfort with applying it in his own classroom especially with respect to how much responsibility and stock Shor places in students (39).\n\nLazere's critique of previous scholarship related to multiculturalism pedagogies, in \"Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric\" and elsewhere, has prompted current composition theorists, both in second-language writing and in the field of composition in general, to consider how multicultural pedagogies can embrace globalism as much as localism.\n\nFor example, Lisa Eck's \"Thinking Globally, Teaching Locally\" describes how Eck teaches world literature courses in which students read cultural narratives and problematize them—in the article, she references her use of Tsitsi Dangarembga's \"Nervous Conditions\" in her composition classroom. Through her teaching, she is attempting to answer the question of how multicultural pedagogical practices could still be based in research, critical literacy, and problem-posing education. In her approach, she engages students in the kind of literary criticism that is necessary for analyzing and evaluating critical discourse: \"I work to make hybrid postcolonial identities familiar, even analogous at times, to what we understand as the process of identity formation for the average postmodern college student….I [also] use the Otherness of the cultures reproduced in foreign texts to estrange the American familiar\" (579). The kinds of inquiry students are using to analyze the text are to show how the text is \"both\" \"not about you\" and \"about you,\" and how these processes of identity formation are the kinds of processes necessary to critically evaluate public discourse.\n\nFurthermore, Jennifer S. Wilson's approach to critical pedagogy in second-language writing as she describes it in her article, \"Engaging Second Language Writers in Freshman Composition: A Critical Approach,\" utilizes a perspective that provides opportunities for the types of writing necessary for students to critically analyze and evaluate ideologies entrenched in the dominant discourse, even as they are learning English as their second language. In other words, the four major elements of the course that Wilson describes, especially with respect to the ideas she offers for critical writing assignments, create alternative pathways for students to produce writing that has the potential to disrupt cultural and political ideologies represented in various avenues and niches of the dominant public discourse. For example, in addition to incorporating \"local topics,\" Wilson provides options for students to \"investigate language use in certain communities, societies, or cultures\" as well as \"investigating\" the relationships between language and power (8-9). Even more important, she insists that \"[c]ritical pedagogy is concerned with minimizing the power differential between student and teacher; in composition classrooms one way for students to maximize their voices is to publish their work in authentic ways\" (9).\n\nBecause academic discourse is not monolithic (in other words, there are curricula that address that the concept of academic discourse can be applied to specific parts of a writing curriculum), many compositionists have created a writing across the curriculum (WAC) movement that situates writing-intensive instruction in specific academic discourse communities.\n\nMany university writing programs include writing in the disciplines (WID) courses, which focus on the genres and writing procedures that occur within specific fields of research.\n\nMany colleges and universities have a writing center, which offers supplementary tutorial support for writing specifically in English classes and/or across the curriculum. Many universities not in North America only offer writing instruction via writing centers. The European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing (EATAW), for example, specifically concerns itself with the study and advancement of writing centers in Europe.\n\nSince multimodality has resonated with Composition Studies, many writing centers have developed associated centers to support students' multimodal, multimedia composing. Some models for this work include the digital studio and the multiliteracy center.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1767727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1767727", "title": "Conflict management", "text": "Conflict management\n\nConflict management is the process of limiting the negative aspects of conflict while increasing the positive aspects of conflict. The aim of conflict management is to enhance learning and group outcomes, including effectiveness or performance in an organizational setting. Properly managed conflict can improve group outcomes.\n\nConflict resolution involves the reduction, elimination, or termination of all forms and types of conflict. Five styles for conflict management, as identified by Thomas and Kilmann, are: competing, compromising, collaborating, avoiding, and accommodating.\n\nBusinesses can benefit from appropriate types and levels of conflict. That is the aim of conflict management, and not the aim of conflict resolution. Conflict management does not imply conflict resolution.\n\nConflict management minimizes the negative outcomes of conflict and promotes the positive outcomes of conflict with the goal of improving learning in an organization.\n\nProperly managed conflict increases organizational learning by increasing the number of questions asked and encourages people to challenge the status quo.\n\nOrganizational conflict at the interpersonal level includes disputes between peers as well as supervisor-subordinate conflict. Party-directed mediation (PDM) is a mediation approach particularly suited for disputes between co-workers, colleagues or peers, especially deep-seated interpersonal conflict, multicultural or multiethnic disputes. The mediator listens to each party separately in a pre-caucus or pre-mediation before ever bringing them into a joint session. Part of the pre-caucus also includes coaching and role plays. The idea is that the parties learn how to converse directly with their adversary in the joint session. Some unique challenges arise when organizational disputes involve supervisors and subordinates. The Negotiated Performance Appraisal (NPA) is a tool for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and is particularly useful as an alternate mediation model because it preserves the hierarchical power of supervisors while encouraging dialogue and dealing with differences in opinion.\n\nThere are three orientations to conflict: lose-lose, win-lose, and win-win. The lose-lose orientation is a type of conflict that tends to end negatively for all parties involved. A win-lose orientation results in one victorious party, usually at the expense of the other. The win-win orientation is one of the most essential concepts to conflict resolution. A win-win solution arrived at by integrative bargaining may be close to optimal for both parties. This approach engages in a cooperative approach rather than a competitive one.\n\nAlthough the win-win concept is the ideal orientation, the notion that there can only be one winner is constantly being reinforced in American culture:\n\n\"The win-lose orientation is manufactured in our society in athletic competition, admission to academic programs, industrial promotion systems, and so on. Individuals tend to generalize from their objective win-lose situations and apply these experiences to situations that are not objectively fixed-pies\".\n\nThis kind of mentality can be destructive when communicating with different cultural groups by creating barriers in negotiation, resolution and compromise; it can also lead the \"loser\" to feel mediocre. When the win-win orientation is absent in negotiation, different responses to conflict may be observed.\n\nBlake and Mouton (1964) were among the first to present a conceptual scheme for classifying the modes (styles) for handling interpersonal conflicts in five types: forcing, withdrawing, smoothing, compromising, and problem solving.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, researchers began using the intentions of the parties involved to classify the styles of conflict management that they included in their models. Both Thomas (1976) and Pruitt (1983) put forth a model based on the concerns of the parties involved in the conflict. The combination of the parties' concern for their own interests (i.e. assertiveness) and their concern for the interests of those across the table (i.e. cooperativeness) yielded a particular conflict management style. Pruitt called these styles yielding (low assertiveness/high cooperativeness), problem solving (high assertiveness/high cooperativeness), inaction (low assertiveness/low cooperativeness), and contending (high assertiveness/low cooperativeness). Pruitt argues that problem-solving is the preferred method when seeking mutually beneficial options (win-win).\n\nKhun and Poole (2000) established a similar system of group conflict management. In their system, they split Kozan's confrontational model into two sub models: distributive and integrative.\n\nDeChurch and Marks (2001) examined the literature available on conflict management at the time and Ni established what they claimed was a \"meta-taxonomy\" that encompasses all other models.\n\nThey argued that all other styles have inherent in them into two dimensions:\n\nIn the study DeChurch and Marks conducted to validate this division, activeness did not have a significant effect on the effectiveness of conflict resolution, but the agreeableness of the conflict management style, whatever it was, did have a positive impact on how groups felt about the way the conflict was managed, regardless of the outcome.\n\nRahim (2002) noted that there is agreement among management scholars that there is no one best approach to how to make decisions, lead or manage conflict.\n\nIn a similar vein, rather than creating a very specific model of conflict management, Rahim created a meta-model (in much the same way that DeChurch and Marks, 2001, created a meta-taxonomy) for conflict styles based on two dimensions, concern for self and concern for others.\n\nWithin this framework are five management approaches: integrating, obliging, dominating, avoiding, and compromising.\n\nSpecial consideration should be paid to conflict management between two parties from distinct cultures. In addition to the everyday sources of conflict, \"misunderstandings, and from this counterproductive, pseudo conflicts, arise when members of one culture are unable to understand culturally determined differences in communication practices, traditions, and thought processing\". Indeed, this has already been observed in the business research literature.\n\nRenner (2007) recounted several episodes where managers from developed countries moved to less developed countries to resolve conflicts within the company and met with little success due to their failure to adapt to the conflict management styles of the local culture.\n\nAs an example, in Kozan's study noted above, he noted that Asian cultures are far more likely to use a harmony model of conflict management. If a party operating from a harmony model comes in conflict with a party using a more confrontational model, misunderstandings above and beyond those generated by the conflict itself will arise.\n\nInternational conflict management, and the cultural issues associated with it, is one of the primary areas of research in the field at the time, as existing research is insufficient to deal with the ever-increasing contact occurring between international entities.\n\nWith only 14% of researched universities reporting mandatory courses in this subject, and with up to 25% of the manager day being spent on dealing with conflict, education needs to reconsider the importance of this subject. The subject warrants emphasis on enabling students to deal with conflict management.\n\n\"Providing more conflict management training in undergraduate business programs could help raise the emotional intelligence of future managers.\" The improvement of emotional intelligence found that employees were more likely to use problem-solving skills, instead of trying to bargain.\n\nStudents need to have a good set of social skills. Good communication skills allow the manager to accomplish interpersonal situations and conflict. Instead of focusing on conflict as a behavior issue, focus on the communication of it.\n\nWith an understanding of the communications required, the student will gain the aptitude needed to differentiate between the nature and types of conflicts. These skills also teach that relational and procedural conflict needs a high degree of immediacy to resolution. If these two conflicts are not dealt with quickly, an employee will become dissatisfied or perform poorly.\n\nIt is also the responsibility of companies to react. One option is to identify the skills needed in-house, but if the skills for creating workplace fairness are already lacking, it may be best to seek assistance from an outside organization, such as a developmental assessment center.\n\nAccording to Rupp, Baldwin, and Bashur, these organizations \"have become a popular means for providing coaching, feedback, and experiential learning opportunities\". Their main focus is fairness and how it impacts employees' attitudes and performance.\n\nThese organizations teach competencies and what they mean. The students then participate in simulations. Multiple observers assess and record what skills are being used and then return this feedback to the participant. After this assessment, participants are then given another set of simulations to utilize the skills learned. Once again they receive additional feedback from observers, in hopes that the learning can be used in their workplace.\n\nThe feedback the participant receives is detailed, behaviorally specific, and high quality. This is needed for the participant to learn how to change their behavior. In this regard, it is also important that the participant take time to self-reflect so that learning may occur.\n\nOnce an assessment program is utilized, action plans may be developed based on quantitative and qualitative data.\n\nWhen personal conflict leads to frustration and loss of efficiency, counseling may prove to be a helpful antidote. Although few organizations can afford the luxury of having professional counselors on the staff, given some training, managers may be able to perform this function. Nondirective counseling, or \"listening with understanding\", is little more than being a good listener —\nsomething every manager should be.\n\nSometimes the simple process of being able to vent one's feelings—that is; to express them to a concerned and understanding listener–is enough to relieve frustration and make it possible for the frustrated individual to advance to a problem-solving frame of mind, better able to cope with a personal difficulty that is affecting his work adversely. The nondirective approach is one effective way for managers to deal with frustrated subordinates and co-workers.\n\nThere are other more direct and more diagnostic ways that might be used in appropriate circumstances. The great strength of the nondirective approach (nondirective counseling is based on the client-centered therapy of Carl Rogers), however, lies in its simplicity, its effectiveness, and the fact that it deliberately avoids the manager-counselor's diagnosing and interpreting emotional problems, which would call for special psychological training. No one has ever been harmed by being listened to sympathetically and understandingly. On the contrary, this approach has helped many people to cope with problems that were interfering with their effectiveness on the job.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1039873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1039873", "title": "Creative writing", "text": "Creative writing\n\nCreative writing is any writing that goes outside the bounds of normal professional, journalistic, academic, or technical forms of literature, typically identified by an emphasis on narrative craft, character development, and the use of literary tropes or with various traditions of poetry and poetics. Due to the looseness of the definition, it is possible for writing such as feature stories to be considered creative writing, even though they fall under journalism, because the content of features is specifically focused on narrative and character development. Both fictional and non-fictional works fall into this category, including such forms as novels, biographies, short stories, and poems. In the academic setting, creative writing is typically separated into fiction and poetry classes, with a focus on writing in an original style, as opposed to imitating pre-existing genres such as crime or horror. Writing for the screen and stage—screenwriting and playwrighting—are often taught separately, but fit under the creative writing category as well.\n\nCreative writing can technically be considered any writing of original composition. In this sense, creative writing is a more contemporary and process-oriented name for what has been traditionally called literature, including the variety of its genres. In her work, \"Foundations of Creativity\", Mary Lee Marksberry references Paul Witty and Lou LaBrant’s \"Teaching the People's Language\" to define creative writing. Marksberry notes:\n\nUnlike its academic counterpart of writing classes that teach students to compose work based on the rules of the language, creative writing is believed to focus on students’ self-expression. While creative writing as an educational subject is often available at some stages, if not throughout, K–12 education, perhaps the most refined form of creative writing as an educational focus is in universities. Following a reworking of university education in the post-war era, creative writing has progressively gained prominence in the university setting. In the UK, the first formal creative writing program was established as a Master of Arts degree at the University of East Anglia in 1970 by the novelists Malcolm Bradbury and Angus Wilson. With the beginning of formal creative writing programs:\nCreative Writing programs are typically available to writers from the high school level all the way through graduate school/university and adult education. Traditionally these programs are associated with the English departments in the respective schools, but this notion has been challenged in recent time as more creative writing programs have spun off into their own department. Most Creative Writing degrees for undergraduates in college are Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees (BFA). Some continue to pursue a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing, the terminal degree in the field. At one time rare, PhD. programs are becoming more prevalent in the field, as more writers attempt to bridge the gap between academic study and artistic pursuit.\n\nCreative writers typically decide an emphasis in either fiction or poetry, and they usually start with short stories or simple poems. They then make a schedule based on this emphasis including literature classes, education classes and workshop classes to strengthen their skills and techniques. Though they have their own programs of study in the fields of film and theatre, screenwriting and playwriting have become more popular in creative writing programs, as creative writing programs attempt to work more closely with film and theatre programs as well as English programs. Creative writing students are encouraged to get involved in extracurricular writing-based activities, such as publishing clubs, school-based literary magazines or newspapers, writing contests, writing colonies or conventions, and extended education classes.\n\nJobs directly related to a degree in creative writing include:\nJobs indirectly related include:\n\nCreative writing is usually taught in a workshop format rather than seminar style. In workshops students usually submit original work for peer critique. Students also format a writing method through the process of writing and re-writing. Some courses teach the means to exploit or access latent creativity or more technical issues such as editing, structural techniques, genres, random idea generating or unblocking writer's block . Some noted authors, such as Michael Chabon, Kazuo Ishiguro, Kevin Brockmeier, Ian McEwan, Karl Kirchwey, Rose Tremain and reputed screenwriters, such as David Benioff, Darren Star and Peter Farrelly, have graduated from university creative writing programs.\n\nCreative writing is considered by some academics (mostly in the USA) to be an extension of the English discipline, even though it is taught around the world in many languages. The English discipline is traditionally seen as the critical study of literary forms, not the creation of literary forms. Some academics see creative writing as a challenge to this tradition. In the UK and Australia, as well as increasingly in the USA and the rest of the world, creative writing is considered a discipline in its own right, not an offshoot of any other discipline.\n\nThose who support creative writing programs either as part or separate from the English discipline, argue for the academic worth of the creative writing experience. They argue that creative writing hones the students’ abilities to clearly express their thoughts and that creative writing entails an in-depth study of literary terms and mechanisms so they can be applied to the writer’s own work to foster improvement. These critical analysis skills are further used in other literary study outside the creative writing sphere. Indeed, the process of creative writing, the crafting of a thought-out and original piece, is considered by some to be experience in creative problem solving.\n\nDespite the large number of academic creative writing programs throughout the world, many people argue that creative writing cannot be taught. Louis Menand explores the issue in an article for the New Yorker in which he quotes Kay Boyle, the director of creative writing program at San Francisco State for sixteen years, who said, “all creative-writing programs ought to be abolished by law.” Contemporary discussions of creative writing at the university level vary widely; some people value MFA programs and regard them with great respect, whereas many MFA candidates and hopefuls lament their chosen programs' lack of both diversity and genre awareness.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2950845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2950845", "title": "De praestigiis daemonum", "text": "De praestigiis daemonum\n\nDe praestigiis daemonum, translated as On the Tricks of Demons, is a book that was a best seller by medical doctor Johann Weyer, also known as Wier, first published in Basel in 1563. The book argues that witchcraft does not exist and that those who claim that practice it are suffering from delusions, which should be treated as mental illnesses, rather than punished as witchcraft. It was influential in the abolishment of witchcraft trials in the Netherlands.\n\nWeyer disagreed with certain contemporaries about the justification of witch-hunting. Weyer believed that most, probably all, cases of alleged witchcraft resulted from delusions of the alleged witch, rather than actual, voluntary cooperation with spiritual evil. In brief, Weyer claimed that cases of alleged witchcraft were psychological rather than supernatural in origin.\\\n\nThe book contains a famous appendix also circulated independently as the \"Pseudomonarchia Daemonum\", a listing of the names and titles of infernal spirits, and the powers alleged to be wielded by each of them. Weyer relates that his source for this intelligence was a book called \"Liber officiorum spirituum, seu liber dictus Empto Salomonis, de principibus et regibus demoniorum\" (\"The book of the offices of spirits, or the book called Empto, by Solomon, about the princes and kings of demons). Weyer's reason for presenting this material was not to instruct his readers in diabolism, but rather to \"expose to all men\" the pretensions of those who claimed to be able to work magic, men who \"are not embarrassed to boast that they are mages, and their oddness, deceptions, vanity, folly, fakery, madness, absence of mind, and obvious lies, to put their hallucinations into the bright light of day.\" Weyer's source claimed that Hell arranged itself hierarchically in an infernal court which is divided into princes, ministries and ambassadors.\n\n\"De Praestigiis\" has been translated into English, French, and German; it was one of the principal sources of Reginald Scot's sceptical account of witchcraft, \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2916335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2916335", "title": "Deterritorialization", "text": "Deterritorialization\n\nDeterritorialization () is a concept created by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in \"Anti-Oedipus\" (1972). The term \"deterritorialization\" first occurs in French psychoanalytic theory to refer, broadly, to the fluid, dissipated and schizophrenic nature of human subjectivity in contemporary capitalist cultures (Deleuze & Guattari 1972).\n\nIts most common use, however, has been in relation to the process of cultural globalization. Though there are different inflections involved, the general implication that globalization needs to be understood in cultural-spatial terms as much as in institutional or political-economic ones is common to all accounts. In this broad sense, deterritorialization has affinities with the idea of the \"disembedding\" of social relations in, for example, Anthony Giddens's (1990) analysis of the globalizing properties of modernity.\n\n\"A Thousand Plateaus\" (1980) distinguishes between relative and an absolute deterritorialization. Relative deterritorialization is always accompanied by reterritorialization, while positive absolute deterritorialization is more akin to the construction of a \"plane of immanence\", akin to Spinoza's ontological constitution of the world. There is also a negative sort of absolute deterritorialization, for example in the subjectivation process (\"the face\"). \n\nThe function of deterritorialization is defined as \"the movement by which one leaves a territory\", also known as a \"line of flight\". Still, deterritorialization \"constitutes and extends\" the territory itself.\n\nWhen referring to culture, anthropologists use the term deterritorialized to refer to a weakening of ties between culture and place. This means the removal of cultural subjects and objects from a certain location in space and time. It implies that certain cultural aspects tend to transcend specific territorial boundaries in a world that consists of things fundamentally in motion.\n\nIn the context of cultural globalization, some argue deterritorialization is a cultural feature developed by the \"mediatization, migration, and commodification which characterize globalized modernity\". This implies that by people working towards closer involvement with the whole of the world, and works towards lessening the gap with one another, one may be widening the gap with what is physically close to them.\n\nAccording to the works of Arjun Appadurai, this cultural distancing from the locality, is intensified when people are able to expand and alter their imagination through the mediatization of alien cultural conditions, making this culture of remote origin one of a familiar material. This makes it difficult for a local entity to sustain and retain its own local cultural identity, which also affects the national identity of the region.\n\nFrom Appadurai's 1990 essay \"Disjuncture and Difference\": \"Deterritorialization, in general, is one of the central forces of the modern world because it brings laboring populations in to the lower-class sectors and spaces of relatively wealthy societies, while sometimes creating exaggerated and intensified senses of criticism or attachment to politics in the home state. Deterritorialization, whether of Hindus, Sikhs, Palestinians, or Ukrainians, is now at the core of a variety of global fundamentalisms, including Islamic and Hindu fundamentalism. In the Hindu case, for example, it is clear that the overseas movement of Indians has been exploited by a variety of interests both within and outside India to create a complicated network of finances and religious identifications, by which the problem of cultural reproduction for Hindus abroad has become tied to the politics of Hindu fundamentalism at home.\n\nAt the same time, deterritorialization creates new markets for film companies, art impressions, and travel agencies, which thrive on the end of the deterritorialized population for contact with its homeland. Naturally, these invented homelands, which constitute the mediascapes of deterritorialized groups, can often become sufficiently fantastic and one-sided that they provide the material for new ideoscapes in which ethnic conflicts can begin to erupt.\" (Appadurai 1990:11–12)\n\nDeterritorialization and reterritorialization exist simultaneously. In Deleuze and Guattari's follow-up to Anti-Oedipus, A Thousand Plateaus, they distinguish between relative deterritorialization, which is always accompanied by reterritorialization, and absolute deterritorialization, which gives rise to a plane of immanence. In both forms of deterritorialization, however, the idea of physical territory remains just that, an idea and reference point.\n\nMediatization works as a preferential source of deterritorialization, while it becomes a catalyser of other sources of deterritorialization (migrations, tourism, vast shopping centres, and economical transformations). As Tomlinson points out, mediatization is absolutely omnipresent in everyday contemporary cultural experiences, it therefore appears as clearly decisive in deterritorialized cultural experience. The aforementioned experience implies opening up to the world and amplifying cultural horizons through the globalized mass media. This means that globalization transforms the relation between the places where we live and our cultural activities, experiences and identities. Paradoxically, deterritorialization also includes reterritorialized manifestations, which García Canclini defines as \"certain relative, partial territorial relocalizations of old and new symbolic productions\". According to the concept of glocalization proposed by Robertson, deterritorialization and reterritorialization constitute both sides of the same coin of cultural globalization. Deterritorialization speaks of the loss of the \"natural\" relation between culture and the social and geographic territories, and describes a deep transformation of the link between our everyday cultural experiences and our configuration as preferably local beings. As Giddens argues, \"the very tissue of spatial experience alters, conjoining proximity and distance in ways that have few close parallels in prior ages\". Nevertheless, it is very important not to interpret the deterritorialization of localized cultural experiences as an impoverishment of cultural interaction, but as a transformation produced by the impact the growing cultural transnational connections have on the local realm, which means that deterritorialization generates a relativization and a transformation of local cultural experiences, whether it is from the local event itself or by the projection of symbolical shapes from the local event.\n\nAlthough the process of across-boundaries flow was imbalanced, it cannot be denied that it has profound influence on politics, economics, and culture from every dimension. Although there were imbalanced power presences in different nations, it is undeniable that people will gradually realize that in addition to their own lives around are mutually implicated in the distant shore, but also to reconcile the impact between their lives around and the distant side. That is, the flow process of beyond the boundaries not only the representatives of strengthening interdependence, but also representatives that they both have the cognitive of globalization. It formed an easily comprehensive characteristics about \"superterritorial\" and \"transworld\". In other words, the original divide in the territorial boundaries between them have lost some authority, what is the main phenomenon of deterritorialization. Therefore, no matter from what angle to explore globalization, deterritorialization has been a general consensus.\n\nThe word \"deterritorialization\" may have different meanings. Tomlinson had pointed out that many scholars use the vocabulary of deterritorialization to explain the process of globalization, however, there are still some scholars who prefer the use of related words, such as \"delocalization\" or \"displacement\". It emphasized different point in the use of different terms, but basically we can understand the meaning of these words that is to understand the transformation between local and cultures of the global modernity. In the text of Tomlinson, however, we found that he uses \"deterritorialization\" to explain the phenomenon instead of using \"delocalization\". But we can unearth that \"deterritorialization\" was more focused on liberating the people from the \"local\", is a process which no longer just only affected by neighborhood and familiar local, but also deeply influenced by the distant place.\n\nAs sociologist Anthony Giddens indicated, the most immediate experience of global modernity, in fact, is we stay in our own familiar environment but feel the feeling of living in different places because of globalization. Say in other words, the local has hardly affected by the distance place, however, under the impact of globalization, distant events made its influence reach into your daily life in the environment, which is the concept of \"displacement\". Due to the space experiences which were combined with neighboring and distant in people's daily life, it can be said that globalization has fundamentally changed our concept of the space.\n\nHowever, communication technology may act not only to fill the field of local cultural significance and identity which corroded by deterritorialization, but also to establish global cultural politics. Politics of deterritorialization and the displacement of sociological will lead the struggle between state and nation. One important new feature of global cultural politics, tied to the disjunctive relationships among the various landscapes which proposed by Appadurai, is that state and nation are at each other's throats, and the hyphen that links them is now less an icon of conjuncture than an index of disjuncture.\n\n\n\n"}

Ethnicity is usually an inherited status based on the society in which one lives. Membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language or dialect, symbolic systems such as religion, mythology and ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art or physical appearance.\n\nEthnic groups, derived from the same historical founder population, often continue to speak related languages and share a similar gene pool. By way of language shift, acculturation, adoption and religious conversion, it is sometimes possible for individuals or groups to leave one ethnic group and become part of another (except for ethnic groups emphasizing homogeneity\nor racial purity as a key membership criterion).\n\nEthnicity is often used synonymously with terms such as nation or people. In English, it can also have the connotation of something exotic (cf. \"ethnic restaurant\", etc.), generally related to cultures of more recent immigrants, who arrived after the dominant population of an area was established.\n\nThe largest ethnic groups in modern times comprise hundreds of millions of individuals (Han Chinese being the largest), while the smallest are limited to a few dozen individuals (numerous indigenous peoples worldwide). Larger ethnic groups may be subdivided into smaller sub-groups known variously as tribes or clans, which over time may become separate ethnic groups themselves due to endogamy or physical isolation from the parent group. Conversely, formerly separate ethnicities can merge to form a pan-ethnicity, and may eventually merge into one single ethnicity. Whether through division or amalgamation, the formation of a separate ethnic identity is referred to as ethnogenesis.\n\nThe term \"ethnic\" is derived from the Greek word ἔθνος \"ethnos\" (more precisely, from the adjective ἐθνικός \"ethnikos\", which was loaned into Latin as \"ethnicus\"). The inherited English language term for this concept is \"folk\", used alongside the latinate \"people\" since the late Middle English period.\n\nIn Early Modern English and until the mid-19th century, \"ethnic\" was used to mean heathen or pagan (in the sense of disparate \"nations\" which did not yet participate in the Christian oikumene), as the Septuagint used \"ta ethne\" (\"the nations\") to translate the Hebrew \"goyim\" \"the nations, non-Hebrews, non-Jews\". The Greek term in early antiquity (Homeric Greek) could refer to any large group, a \"host\" of men, a \"band\" of comrades as well as a \"swarm\" or \"flock\" of animals. In Classical Greek, the term took on a meaning comparable to the concept now expressed by \"ethnic group\", mostly translated as \"nation, people\"; only in Hellenistic Greek did the term tend to become further narrowed to refer to \"foreign\" or \"barbarous\" nations in particular (whence the later meaning \"heathen, pagan\").\n\nIn the 19th century, the term came to be used in the sense of \"peculiar to a race, people or nation\", in a return to the original Greek meaning. The sense of \"different cultural groups\", and in American English \"racial, cultural or national minority group\" arises in the 1930s to 1940s, serving as a replacement of the term race which had earlier taken this sense but was now becoming deprecated due to its association with ideological racism. \nThe abstract \"ethnicity\" had been used for \"paganism\" in the 18th century, but now came to express the meaning of an \"ethnic character\" (first recorded 1953).\nThe term \"ethnic group\" was first recorded in 1935 and entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1972. Depending on the context that is used, the term nationality may either be used synonymously with ethnicity, or synonymously with citizenship (in a sovereign state). The process that results in the emergence of an ethnicity is called ethnogenesis, a term in use in ethnological literature since about 1950.\n\nDepending on which source of group identity is emphasized to define membership, the following types of (often mutually overlapping) groups can be identified:\n\nIn many cases – for instance, the sense of Jewish peoplehood– more than one aspect determines membership.\n\nEthnography begins in classical antiquity; after early authors like Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus, Herodotus in c. 480 BC laid the foundation of both historiography and ethnography of the ancient world. The Greeks at this time did not describe foreign nations but had also developed a concept of their own \"ethnicity\", which they grouped under the name of Hellenes. Herodotus (8.144.2) gave a famous account of what defined Greek (Hellenic) ethnic identity in his day, enumerating\n\nWhether ethnicity qualifies as a cultural universal is to some extent dependent on the exact definition used. According to \"Challenges of Measuring an Ethnic World: Science, politics, and reality\", in Challenges of Measuring an Ethnic World: Science, Politics and Reality : Proceedings of the Joint Canada-United States Conference on the Measurement of Ethnicity, April 1–3, 1992, Joint Canada-United States Conference on the Measurement of Ethnicity, Department of Commerce, Statistics Canada, 1993, a conference organised by Statistics Canada and the United States Census Bureau (April 1–3, 1992).\nMany social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.\n\nAccording to Thomas Hylland Eriksen, the study of ethnicity was dominated by two distinct debates until recently.\n\nAccording to Eriksen, these debates have been superseded, especially in anthropology, by scholars' attempts to respond to increasingly politicised forms of self-representation by members of different ethnic groups and nations. This is in the context of debates over multiculturalism in countries, such as the United States and Canada, which have large immigrant populations from many different cultures, and post-colonialism in the Caribbean and South Asia.\n\nMax Weber maintained that ethnic groups were \"künstlich\" (artificial, i.e. a social construct) because they were based on a subjective belief in shared \"Gemeinschaft\" (community). Secondly, this belief in shared Gemeinschaft did not create the group; the group created the belief. Third, group formation resulted from the drive to monopolise power and status. This was contrary to the prevailing naturalist belief of the time, which held that socio-cultural and behavioral differences between peoples stemmed from inherited traits and tendencies derived from common descent, then called \"race\".\n\nAnother influential theoretician of ethnicity was Fredrik Barth, whose \"Ethnic Groups and Boundaries\" from 1969 has been described as instrumental in spreading the usage of the term in social studies in the 1980s and 1990s. Barth went further than Weber in stressing the constructed nature of ethnicity. To Barth, ethnicity was perpetually negotiated and renegotiated by both external ascription and internal self-identification. Barth's view is that ethnic groups are not discontinuous cultural isolates, or logical \"a prioris\" to which people naturally belong. He wanted to part with anthropological notions of cultures as bounded entities, and ethnicity as primordialist bonds, replacing it with a focus on the interface between groups. \"Ethnic Groups and Boundaries\", therefore, is a focus on the interconnectedness of ethnic identities. Barth writes: \"...categorical ethnic distinctions do not depend on an absence of mobility, contact and information, but do entail social processes of exclusion and incorporation whereby discrete categories are maintained despite changing participation and membership in the course of individual life histories.\"\n\nIn 1978, anthropologist Ronald Cohen claimed that the identification of \"ethnic groups\" in the usage of social scientists often reflected inaccurate labels more than indigenous realities:\n...the named ethnic identities we accept, often unthinkingly, as basic givens in the literature are often arbitrarily, or even worse inaccurately, imposed. \nIn this way, he pointed to the fact that identification of an ethnic group by outsiders, e.g. anthropologists, may not coincide with the self-identification of the members of that group. He also described that in the first decades of usage, the term ethnicity had often been used in lieu of older terms such as \"cultural\" or \"tribal\" when referring to smaller groups with shared cultural systems and shared heritage, but that \"ethnicity\" had the added value of being able to describe the commonalities between systems of group identity in both tribal and modern societies. Cohen also suggested that claims concerning \"ethnic\" identity (like earlier claims concerning \"tribal\" identity) are often colonialist practices and effects of the relations between colonized peoples and nation-states.\n\nAccording to Paul James, formations of identity were often changed and distorted by colonization, but identities are not made out of nothing:\n[C]ategorizations about identity, even when codified and hardened into clear typologies by processes of colonization, state formation or general modernizing processes, are always full of tensions and contradictions. Sometimes these contradictions are destructive, but they can also be creative and positive.\n\nSocial scientists have thus focused on how, when, and why different markers of ethnic identity become salient. Thus, anthropologist Joan Vincent observed that ethnic boundaries often have a mercurial character. Ronald Cohen concluded that ethnicity is \"a series of nesting dichotomizations of inclusiveness and exclusiveness\". He agrees with Joan Vincent's observation that (in Cohen's paraphrase) \"Ethnicity... can be narrowed or broadened in boundary terms in relation to the specific needs of political mobilization. This may be why descent is sometimes a marker of ethnicity, and sometimes not: which diacritic of ethnicity is salient depends on whether people are scaling ethnic boundaries up or down, and whether they are scaling them up or down depends generally on the political situation.\n\nDifferent approaches to understanding ethnicity have been used by different social scientists when trying to understand the nature of ethnicity as a factor in human life and society. As Jonathan M. Hall observes, World War II was a turning point in the ethnic studies. The consequences of Nazi racism discouraged essentianlist interpretations of ethnic groups and race. Ethnic groups came to be defined as social rather than as biological entities. Their coherence was attributed to shared myths, descent, kinship, a common place of origin, language, religion, customs and national character. So, ethnic groups are conceived as mutable rather than stable, constructed in discursive practices rather than written in the genes.\n\nExamples of various approaches are: primordialism, essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, modernism and instrumentalism.\n\nEthnicity is an important means by which people may identify with a larger group. Many social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.\nProcesses that result in the emergence of such identification are called ethnogenesis. Members of an ethnic group, on the whole, claim cultural continuities over time, although historians and cultural anthropologists have documented that many of the values, practices, and norms that imply continuity with the past are of relatively recent invention.\n\nEthnic groups differ from other social groups, such as subcultures, interest groups or social classes, because they emerge and change over historical periods (centuries) in a process known as ethnogenesis, a period of several generations of endogamy resulting in common ancestry (which is then sometimes cast in terms of a mythological narrative of a founding figure); ethnic identity is reinforced by reference to \"boundary markers\" - characteristics said to be unique to the group which set it apart from other groups.\n\n\"Ethnicity theory\" says that race is a social category and is but one of several factors in determining ethnicity. Some other criteria include: \"religion, language, 'customs,' nationality, and political identification\". This theory was put forth by sociologist Robert E. Park in the 1920s. It is based on the notion of “culture”.\n\nThis theory was preceded by over a century where biological essentialism was the dominant paradigm on race. Biological essentialism is the belief that white European races are biologically superior and other non-white races are inherently inferior. This view arose as a way to justify slavery of Africans and genocide of the Native Americans in a society which was supposedly founded on freedom for all. This was a notion that developed slowly and came to be a preoccupation of scientists, theologians, and the public. Religious institutions asked questions about whether there had been multiple genesis's (polygenesis) and whether God had created lesser races of men. Many of the foremost scientists of the time took up idea of racial difference. They would inadvertently find that white Europeans were superior. One method that was used was the measurement of cranial capacity.\n\nEthnicity theory was based on the assimilation model. Park outlined his four steps to assimilation: contact, conflict, accommodation, and assimilation. Instead of explaining the marginalized status of people of color in the United States with an inherent biological inferiority, he instead said that it was a failure to assimilate into American culture that held people back. They could be equal as long as they dropped their culture which was deficient compared to white culture.\n\nMichael Omi and Howard Winant's theory of racial formation directly confronts both ethnicity theory's premises and practices. They argue in Racial Formation in the United States that ethnicity theory was exclusively based on the immigration patterns of a white ethnic population and did not account for the unique experiences of non-whites in this country. While this theory identities different stages in an immigration process– contact, conflict, struggle, and as the last and best response, assimilation– it did so only for white ethnic communities. The ethnicity paradigm neglects the ways that race can complicate a community's interactions with basic social and political structures, especially upon contact.\n\nAnd assimilation– shedding the particular qualities of a native culture for the purpose of blending in with a host culture– did not work for some groups as a response to racism and discrimination as it did for others. Moreover, once the legal barriers to achieving equality had been dismantled, the problem of racism became the sole responsibility of already disadvantaged communities. It was assumed that if a Black or Latino community was not 'making it' by the standards that had been set by white ethnics, it was because that community did not hold the right values or beliefs. Or they must be stubbornly resisting dominant norms because they did not want to fit in. Omi and Winant's critique of ethnicity theory explains how looking towards a cultural defect for the source of inequality ignores the \"concrete sociopolitical dynamics within which racial phenomena operate in the U.S.\" In other words, buying into this approach effectively strips us of our ability to critically examine the more structural components of racism and encourages, instead, a “benign neglect” of social inequality.\n\nIn some cases, especially involving transnational migration, or colonial expansion, ethnicity is linked to nationality. Anthropologists and historians, following the modernist understanding of ethnicity as proposed by Ernest Gellner and Benedict Anderson see nations and nationalism as developing with the rise of the modern state system in the 17th century. They culminated in the rise of \"nation-states\" in which the presumptive boundaries of the nation coincided (or ideally coincided) with state boundaries.\nThus, in the West, the notion of ethnicity, like race and nation, developed in the context of European colonial expansion, when mercantilism and capitalism were promoting global movements of populations at the same time that state boundaries were being more clearly and rigidly defined.\n\nIn the 19th century, modern states generally sought legitimacy through their claim to represent \"nations.\" Nation-states, however, invariably include populations that have been excluded from national life for one reason or another. Members of excluded groups, consequently, will either demand inclusion on the basis of equality, or seek autonomy, sometimes even to the extent of complete political separation in their own nation-state. Under these conditions– when people moved from one state to another, or one state conquered or colonized peoples beyond its national boundaries– ethnic groups were formed by people who identified with one nation, but lived in another state.\n\nMulti-ethnic states can be the result of two opposite events, either the recent creation of state borders at variance with traditional tribal territories, or the recent immigration of ethnic minorities into a former nation state.\nExamples for the first case are found throughout Africa, where countries created during decolonisation inherited arbitrary colonial borders, but also in European countries such as Belgium or United Kingdom. Examples for the second case are countries such as Germany or the Netherlands, which were relatively ethnically homogeneous when they attained statehood but have received significant immigration during the second half of the 20th century. States such as the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland comprised distinct ethnic groups from their formation and have likewise experienced substantial immigration, resulting in what has been termed \"multicultural\" societies especially in large cities.\n\nThe states of the New World were multi-ethnic from the onset, as they were formed as colonies imposed on existing indigenous populations.\n\nIn recent decades feminist scholars (most notably Nira Yuval-Davis) have drawn attention to the fundamental ways in which women participate in the creation and reproduction of ethnic and national categories. Though these categories are usually discussed as belonging to the public, political sphere, they are upheld within the private, family sphere to a great extent. It is here that women act not just as biological reproducers but also as 'cultural carriers', transmitting knowledge and enforcing behaviours that belong to a specific collectivity. Women also often play a significant symbolic role in conceptions of nation or ethnicity, for example in the notion that 'women and children' constitute the kernel of a nation which must be defended in times of conflict, or in iconic figures such as Britannia or Marianne.\n\nRace and ethnicity are considered as related concepts. Ethnicity is used as a matter of cultural identity of a group, often based on shared ancestry, language and cultural traditions, while race is applied as a pseudoscientific grouping, based on physical similarities within groups. Race is a more controversial subject than ethnicity, due to common political use of the term. It is assumed that, based on power relations, there exist \"racialized ethnicities\" and \"ethnicized races\". Ramón Grosfoguel (University of California, Berkeley) argues that 'racial/ethnic identity' is one concept and that concepts of race and ethnicity cannot be used as separate and autonomous categories.\n\nBefore Weber (1864-1920), race and ethnicity were primarily seen as two aspects of the same thing. Around 1900 and before, the essentialist primordialist understanding of ethnicity predominated: cultural differences between peoples were seen as being the result of inherited traits and tendencies. With Weber's introduction of the idea of ethnicity as a social construct, race and ethnicity became more divided from each other.\n\nIn 1950 the UNESCO statement, \"The Race Question\", signed by some of the internationally renowned scholars of the time (including Ashley Montagu, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Gunnar Myrdal, Julian Huxley, etc.), stated: \"National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cultural groups do not necessarily coincide with racial groups: and the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connection with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term 'race' is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term 'race' altogether and speak of 'ethnic groups'.\"\n\nIn 1982 anthropologist David Craig Griffith summed up forty years of ethnographic research, arguing that racial and ethnic categories are symbolic markers for different ways that people from different parts of the world have been incorporated into a global economy:\nAccording to Wolf, racial categories were constructed and incorporated during the period of European mercantile expansion, and ethnic groupings during the period of capitalist expansion.\n\nWriting in 1977 about the usage of the term \"ethnic\" in the ordinary language of Great Britain and the United States, Wallman noted that\nIn the U.S., the OMB defines the concept of race as outlined for the US Census as not \"scientific or anthropological\" and takes into account \"social and cultural characteristics as well as ancestry\", using \"appropriate scientific methodologies\" that are not \"primarily biological or genetic in reference\".\n\nSometimes ethnic groups are subject to prejudicial attitudes and actions by the state or its constituents. In the 20th century, people began to argue that conflicts among ethnic groups or between members of an ethnic group and the state can and should be resolved in one of two ways. Some, like Jürgen Habermas and Bruce Barry, have argued that the legitimacy of modern states must be based on a notion of political rights of autonomous individual subjects. According to this view, the state should not acknowledge ethnic, national or racial identity but rather instead enforce political and legal equality of all individuals. Others, like Charles Taylor and Will Kymlicka, argue that the notion of the autonomous individual is itself a cultural construct. According to this view, states must recognize ethnic identity and develop processes through which the particular needs of ethnic groups can be accommodated within the boundaries of the nation-state.\n\nThe 19th century saw the development of the political ideology of ethnic nationalism, when the concept of race was tied to nationalism, first by German theorists including Johann Gottfried von Herder. Instances of societies focusing on ethnic ties, arguably to the exclusion of history or historical context, have resulted in the justification of nationalist goals. Two periods frequently cited as examples of this are the 19th century consolidation and expansion of the German Empire and the 20th century Nazi Germany. Each promoted the pan-ethnic idea that these governments were only acquiring lands that had always been inhabited by ethnic Germans. The history of late-comers to the nation-state model, such as those arising in the Near East and south-eastern Europe out of the dissolution of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, as well as those arising out of the former USSR, is marked by inter-ethnic conflicts. Such conflicts usually occur within multi-ethnic states, as opposed to between them, as in other regions of the world. Thus, the conflicts are often misleadingly labelled and characterized as civil wars when they are inter-ethnic conflicts in a multi-ethnic state.\n\nEthnic groups in Africa number in the hundreds, each generally having its own language (or dialect of a language) and culture.\n\nMany ethnic groups and nations of Africa qualify, although some groups are of a size larger than a tribal society. These mostly originate with the Sahelian kingdoms of the medieval period, such as that of the Akan, deriving from Bonoman (11th century) then the Kingdom of Ashanti (17th century).\n\nThere is an abundance of ethnic groups throughout Asia, with adaptations to the climate zones of Asia, which can be Arctic, subarctic, temperate, subtropical or tropical. The ethnic groups have adapted to mountains, deserts, grasslands, and forests.\n\nOn the coasts of Asia, the ethnic groups have adopted various methods of harvest and transport. Some groups are primarily hunter-gatherers, some practice transhumance (nomadic lifestyle), others have been agrarian/rural for millennia and others becoming industrial/urban. Some groups/countries of Asia are completely urban (Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore). The colonization of Asia was largely ended in the 20th century, with national drives for independence and self-determination across the continent.\n\nEurope has a large number of ethnic groups; Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct \"peoples of Europe\", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities within every state they inhabit (although they may form local regional majorities within a sub-national entity). The total number of national minority populations in Europe is estimated at 105 million people, or 14% of 770 million Europeans.\n\nA number of European countries, including France, and Switzerland do not collect information on the ethnicity of their resident population.\n\nRussia has over 185 recognized ethnic groups besides the 80% ethnic Russian majority. The largest group are the Tatars 3.8%.\nMany of the smaller groups are found in the Asian part of Russia (see Indigenous peoples of Siberia).\n\nAn example of a largely nomadic ethnic group in Europe is the Roma, pejoratively known as Gypsies. They originated from India and speak the Romani language.\n\n"}
{"id": "529208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=529208", "title": "Hapa", "text": "Hapa\n\nThe term \"hapa\" is a Native Hawaiian word which is literally translated as \"part\" or \"mix.\" In Hawaii, the word refers to any person of mixed ethnic heritage, regardless of the specific mixture. In California, the term has been used recently for any person of East Asian or Southeast Asian admixture. Therefore, the two uses are concurrent.\n\nContemporarily, Hapa has also come to mean a person of mixed Asian and other racial heritage.\n\nIn Hawaii, the term can be used in conjunction with other Hawaiian racial and ethnic descriptors to specify a particular racial or ethnic mixture. An example of this is \"hapa haole\" (part European/White).\n\nPukui states that the original meaning of the word \"haole\" was \"foreigner\". Therefore, all non-Hawaiians can be called \"haole\". In practical terms, however, the term is used as a racial description for Caucasians (whites), with the specific exclusion of Portuguese. Portuguese were traditionally considered to be a separate race in Hawaii.\n\n\"Hapa-haole\" also is the name of a type of Hawaiian music in which the tune, styling, and/or subject matter is Hawaiian, but the lyrics are partly, mostly, or entirely in English. Many \"hapa-haole\" songs had their musical roots in the Western tradition, and the lyrics were in some combination of English and Hawaiian; these songs first gained popularity outside the Territory of Hawaii beginning in 1912–1915, and include titles such as \"My Little Grass Shack in Kealakekua\" and \"Sweet Leilani\".\n\n\"Hapa haole\" is also used for Hawaiian-language hula songs that are partly in English, thus disqualifying them as \"authentic\" Hawaiian hula in some venues such as the Merrie Monarch Festival.\n\nSome see the use of the term as a misappropriation of Hawaiian culture. Others take a stronger stand in discouraging its usage and misuse as they consider the term to be vulgar and racist. However, the term, unlike other words referring to mixed race people, is not and has never been a derogatory term when used in its original Hawaiian context, although it was later degraded by non-Hawaiians such as Japanese-Americans. As Wei Ming Dariotis states, Hapa' was chosen because it was the only word we could find that did not really cause us pain. It is not any of the Asian words for mixed Asian people that contain negative connotations either literally (e.g. 'children of the dust', 'mixed animal') or by association (Eurasian).\"\nIn 2010, a film called One Big Hapa Family was released about Japanese-Canadians.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53835973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53835973", "title": "Happy Death Day", "text": "Happy Death Day\n\nHappy Death Day is a 2017 American slasher film directed by Christopher Landon, written by Scott Lobdell and starring Jessica Rothe, Israel Broussard, and Ruby Modine. The film was produced by Jason Blum through his Blumhouse Productions banner. It follows a college student who is murdered on her birthday and begins reliving the day over and over again, at which point she sets out to find the killer and stop her death.\n\nOriginally announced in 2007 under the title \"Half to Death\", the film was released on October 13, 2017, by Universal Pictures. It grossed $122 million worldwide on a $4.8 million budget and received generally positive reviews, with critics deeming the film entertaining while acknowledging the familiar premise, and describing it as \"\"Groundhog Day\" meets \"Scream\"\". A sequel, \"Happy Death Day 2U\", is scheduled to be released in February 2019.\n\nTheresa \"Tree\" Gelbman wakes up on her birthday in the dorm room of her classmate Carter Davis after drunken partying the previous evening. Tree ignores phone calls from her widowed father David. She dismisses Carter while leaving his room, and throws away a birthday cupcake given to her by her roommate Lori Spengler. Tree also meets with her married professor, Gregory Butler, with whom she is having an affair. That night, on her way to a party, Tree is lured into a tunnel and murdered by a figure wearing a mask of the campus mascot.\n\nTree wakes up the next morning in Carter's bed. She is unnerved to find the previous day's events repeating themselves. Baffled, she nonetheless relives the day and uses this second chance to avoid the tunnel and reach the party. However, the masked killer follows her to the party and murders her again. Tree awakens in Carter's bed, realizes that she is in a time loop and barricades herself in her room to avoid death. The killer, however, is already hiding there and slays her a third time.\n\nUpon waking up, Tree relays her story to Carter. He suggests taking advantage of the loop to identify her killer. She spends the next several iterations trailing suspected classmates and getting killed each time. After a loop where she is bludgeoned, Tree faints and awakens in the campus hospital. Her body shows evidence of recovery from multiple traumatic injuries, indicating that she has retained physical damage from her previous deaths. Shortly after escaping from the hospital, Tree is pursued and killed again.\n\nWaking up in Carter's bed again, Tree convinces Carter of her predicament by demonstrating her knowledge of the day's events. Tree admits to having a tremendous case of self-loathing, particularly for pushing away her father after the death of her mother years ago. Later, Tree sees a local news report on John Tombs, a serial killer being held at the campus hospital. Concluding that Tombs is her killer, Tree rushes to the hospital to warn of his escape. Tombs breaks free and nearly kills Tree, but Carter follows and rescues her. Tombs kills Carter before chasing Tree to a nearby bell tower, where she subdues him with a crowbar. Realizing that Carter will remain dead if she ends the loop, Tree hangs herself.\n\nBelieving she has solved her murder, Tree is happier and more relaxed during the next loop. Tree ends her affair with Professor Butler. She meets her father for lunch, and the two patch things up between themselves. That night she goes to the hospital, where she traps and kills Tombs. Relieved to finally be free, she celebrates her birthday in Carter's room and eats the cupcake given to her by Lori.\n\nTree wakes up still in the loop; confused and angered by her predicament, she returns to her room, where Lori offers her the cupcake again. Tree realizes this was the only time she had ever eaten the cupcake, dying in her sleep. Tree deduces that Lori, not Tombs, is her killer; Lori had poisoned the cupcake, which Tree declined to eat. So Lori utilized her job as a nurse at the hospital to drug and frame Tombs for Tree's murder. Tree invites Lori to eat the cupcake herself; when Lori will not, Tree proposes taking the cupcake to the police. Lori locks the door to prevent Tree from leaving, and admits to having an affair with Professor Butler herself. The jealous Lori attacks Tree, who stuffs the poisoned cupcake in Lori's mouth. She then kicks Lori through a window to her death.\n\nTree and Carter muse over the day's events in a restaurant. He offers her his room for the night, and Tree wakes up the next day believing herself to still be in the loop. Carter reveals it to be the next day at last; he was playing a prank on her. Tree is too relieved to be angry at him and the two kiss.\n\nThe film was first announced in July 2007, with Megan Fox attached to star. The film was originally titled \"Half to Death\", produced by Michael Bay and Rogue Pictures, and directed by Antti Jokinen. Christopher Landon was hired to rewrite the Scott Lobdell screenplay, and while he liked the reworked script the studio decided to not move on with it. The project was only revived years later, as original producer Angela Mancuso had lunch with Landon and remembered about \"Half to Death\". Landon decided to send the script to Jason Blum of Blumhouse Productions, with whom he had worked in the \"Paranormal Activity\" sequels, and he approved it, leading to a green-light by Universal Pictures. Blumhouse announced the project on October 11, 2016, with Landon directing and Jessica Rothe cast in the lead role of the film. On November 8, 2016, it was announced that Ruby Modine, Charles Aitken and Rachel Matthews had joined the cast, alongside Rothe and Israel Broussard. The film got eventually retitled \"Happy Death Day\" in June 2017.\n\nThe mask was constructed by Tony Gardner, the same man who built the \"Ghostface\" mask from every \"Scream\" film, and its design was personal. Landon explains, \"During preproduction ... I was expecting my first son. I don't know if I just had babies on the brain, or if I was subconsciously scared to become a father, but that baby image was floating around in my head. Tony made us a pig mask, too, but when I wore the baby mask in the office, I scared a co-worker, and we thought ... yeah, this is it. This is the one.\" \"Scream\" itself was listed among the influences Christopher Landon took for the film, along with \"Halloween\" (1978), \"Groundhog Day\" and comedies of the 1980s such as \"Sixteen Candles\" and \"Back to the Future\", given he aimed to make a \"fun, silly horror movie\". He also aimed to emulate the protagonist's personal growth in \"Groundhog Day\" to comment on \"this age of social media and all the crappy things that kids do to each other.\"\n\nComic book writer Scott Lobdell said he wanted to play with the tropes of the slasher genre, as according to him \"every slasher film opens up with the mean girl getting killed and the good girl living till the end. And I thought, 'How can I make the mean girl and the good girl the same person?'\" In the original draft, Lori and Dr. Butler were the killers together. Landon says, \"They were a psycho couple murdering Tree together. That ultimately didn't work for me. I thought Gregory was a great opportunity to be a suspect. To make him a killer, it didn't help me. That was a change I really wanted to make.\" Also, in the original draft there was no birthday, and no romance, which Landon added to humanize Tree. Landon decided to shorten the protagonist's name Teresa into Tree, which also conveyed her character arc as \"trees need to grow and you see this character go from one person to another\".\n\nFilming took place at and around Loyola University in New Orleans, Louisiana, and it lasted 5 weeks. The scenes where Tree awakens in Carter's bed after her death were filmed back to back in a span of two days. The scene after Lori dies was supposed to be at the sorority house, but the filming permit was over before production was able to shoot there, forcing the location to be changed into a Los Angeles diner also featured in another Blumhouse production, \"Split\".\n\nIn the original ending of the film, Tree is taken to the hospital after her encounter with Lori. The doctor instructs her to stay away from pain medication for at least a day due to the extent of her injuries. After he leaves, a nurse comes in and tells Tree she is giving Tree something for the pain and Tree informs the nurse of the doctor's orders. The nurse reveals herself to be Dr. Butler's wife Stephanie, who says it is for her pain and then murders Tree in revenge for the affair between her and Dr. Butler.\n\nThis version was shown in the test screenings for the film, and was received negatively by the audience, forcing the writers to come up with the theatrical ending. Director Christopher Landon also revealed Lori and Dr. Butler were the killers in the rough drafts, which later inspired the idea of the poisoned cupcake.\n\nBear McCreary composed the score of \"Happy Death Day\". Reflecting the film's blend of horror and comedy, McCreary stated that he wanted \"a schizophrenic, dual personality, with light-hearted comedic scoring on one end, and genuinely terrifying soundscapes on the other.\" This approach is highlighted by the two main leitmotifs, an energetic theme for Tree evoking contemporary pop music, and one for the killer that consists of distorted vocals provided by McCreary's young daughter Sonatin. The percussion in the score are mostly sampled from college marching band drum lines to evoke the collegiate setting. While the film's trailer featured 50 Cent's \"In Da Club\" as Tree's ringtone, Landon said the film could not afford to use the track, but still preferred the eventual song music supervisor Andrea von Foerster improvised, the comedic \"Busy Day Birthday\".\n\n\"Happy Death Day\" grossed $55.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $67 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $122.6 million, against a production budget of $4.8 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"Happy Death Day\" was released alongside \"Marshall\", \"The Foreigner\" and \"Professor Marston and the Wonder Women\", and was expected to gross $15–20 million from 3,130 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $1 million from Thursday night previews at 2,450 theaters, similar to fellow Blumhouse release \"The Visit\" ($1.05 million in 2015) and $11.6 million on its first day, increasing weekend projections to $26 million. It went on to debut to $26 million, topping the box office, making it the third Blumhouse Productions film of 2017 (after \"Split\" and \"Get Out\") to do so. It fell 64% in its second weekend to $9.4 million, finishing in third behind newcomers \"Boo 2! A Madea Halloween\" and \"Geostorm\".\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 71% based on 133 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Happy Death Day\" puts a darkly humorous sci-fi spin on slasher conventions, with added edge courtesy of a starmaking performance from Jessica Rothe.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 52% \"definite recommend\".\n\nCritics noted that although the film makes laudatory attempts at merging genres—including romantic comedy, horror and \"campus satire\"—the end results were mixed. Jamie East from \"The Sun\" likened it to a \"slasher \"Mean Girls\",\" while Chris Agar of Screen Rant said that the \"fun, if silly, blending of genre tropes ... ends up being a double-edged sword.\"\n\nThe film was released on digital HD on January 2, 2018 and was released on DVD and Blu-Ray on January 16, 2018. The home release features the original ending.\n\nDirector Christopher Landon talked about the possibility of a sequel, focusing on why Tree went into a time loop. Jessica Rothe stated that while most horror sequels retread the original, Landon's pitch instead \"elevates the movie from being a horror movie into a \"Back to the Future\" type of genre film where the sequel joins us right from where we left off, it explains a lot of things in the first one that didn't get explained, and it elevates everything.\"\n\nThe sequel was officially announced with filming scheduled to begin on May 10, 2018. Most of the original actors return, including Rothe, Modine, Israel Broussard, and Rachel Matthews. In addition, Suraj Sharma and Sarah Yarkin have been cast. In September 2018, the sequel's release was set for February 14, 2019.\n\n\n\n]\n"}

The style is related to the Socratic method. Developed at Phillips Exeter Academy, the method's name comes from the oil magnate and philanthropist Edward Harkness, a graduate of St. Paul's School, who presented the school with a monetary gift in 1930. It has been adopted in numerous schools, where small class-size makes it effective, but it remains impractical for larger classes. There are also downsides for students who are not good in taking notes. They must first learn the strategies in proper note-taking in the classroom. Harkness described its use as follows:\n\nHarkness learning can vary, most notably between humanities subjects such as English and history and technical subjects such as math or physics. There are general principles and goals, however, that go along with that method regardless of subject matter. The main goal is to encourage students to come up with ideas of their own and learn good reasoning and discussion skills. Depending on style, the teacher may interact very little, interjecting only to guide the discussion.\n\nThe Whole Group Discussion Technique follows the Harkness Method. It involves interaction throughout the class instead of the teacher simply delivering a lecture with students listening. Many teachers today prefer this approach because of heightened communication between the mentor and students. There are advantages and disadvantages in using this method. Auditory learners find this style more interesting. They are able to keep information completely since sounds reinforce the information. This process includes use of musical notes, memorization of lists, voice recordings, and chants for memorizing history terms. Teachers are able to check what students retain through questioning. Students can concentrate on their lessons and feel more at ease in asking questions during discussions.\n\nHowever, the Whole Group Discussion approach calls for effective classroom management by teachers. Otherwise, it may be too disturbing for them to implement ground rules for students. There are also downsides for students who are not good in taking notes. They must first learn the strategies in proper note-taking in the classroom. There are strategies in effective implementation of Whole Group Discussions. The Think-Pair-Share is commonly used for lower elementary pupils to persuade the children in acquiring listening and speaking skills. Philosophical Chairs is another strategy wherein teachers read sentences or topics with only two likely responses. It is either agree or disagree. Each group of students defends the position it adopted. Fishbowl is one of the most popular classroom discussion techniques. A group of two up to four students sit facing one another at the center of the classroom. The other students sit around their peers. Those at the middle discuss the selected subject matter or question while the others take notes related to the dialogue. The other strategies include Concentric Circles Strategy, Gallery Walk, Pyramid Strategy, and Carousel Walk.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1614090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1614090", "title": "Heritage tourism", "text": "Heritage tourism\n\nCultural heritage tourism (or just heritage tourism or diaspora tourism) is a branch of tourism oriented towards the cultural heritage of the location where tourism is occurring. \n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation in the United States defines heritage tourism as \"traveling to experience the places, artifacts and activities that authentically represent the stories and people of the past\", and \"heritage tourism can include cultural, historic and natural resources\".\n\nCulture has always been a major object of travel, as the development of the Grand Tour from the 16th century onwards attests. In the 20th century, some people have claimed, culture ceased to be the objective of tourism: tourism is now culture. Cultural attractions play an important role in tourism at all levels, from the global highlights of world culture to attractions that underpin local identities. (Richards, 1996)\n\nAccording to the Weiler and Hall, culture, heritage and the arts have long contributed to appeal of tourist destination. However, in recent years 'culture' has been rediscovered as an important marketing tool to attract those travellers with special interests in heritage and arts. \n\nAccording to the Hollinshead, cultural heritage tourism defines as cultural heritage tourism is the fastest growing segment of the tourism industry because there is a trend toward an increase specialization among tourists. This trend is evident in the rise in the volume of tourists who seek adventure, culture, history, archaeology and interaction with local people.\n\nCultural heritage tourism is important for various reasons; it has a positive economic and social impact, it establishes and reinforces identity, it helps preserve the cultural heritage, with culture as an instrument it facilitates harmony and understanding among people, it supports culture and helps renew tourism (Richards, 1996). As Benjamin \nPorter and Noel B. Salazar have ethnographically documented, however, cultural heritage tourism can also create tensions and even conflict between the different stakeholders involved (Porter and Salazar 2005).\n\nCultural heritage tourism has a number of objectives that must be met within the context of sustainable development such as; the conservation of cultural resources, accurate interpretation of resources, authentic visitors experience, and the stimulation of the earned revenues of cultural resources. We can see, therefore, that cultural heritage tourism is not only concerned with identification, management and protection of the heritage values but it must also be involved in understanding the impact of tourism on communities and regions, achieving economic and social benefits, providing financial resources for protection, as well as marketing and promotion. (J. M. Fladmark, 1994)\n\nHeritage tourism involves visiting historical or industrial sites that may include old canals, railways, battlegrounds, etc. The overall purpose is to gain an appreciation of the past. It also refers to the marketing of a location to members of a diaspora who have distant family roots there.\n\nDecolonization and immigration form the major background of much contemporary heritage tourism. Falling travel costs have also made heritage tourism possible for more people.\n\nAnother possible form involves religious travel or pilgrimages. Many Catholics from around the world come to the Vatican and other sites such as Lourdes or Fátima. Islam commands its followers to take the \"hajj\" to Mecca, thus differentiating it somewhat from tourism in the usual sense, though the trip can also be a culturally important event for the pilgrim.\n\nHeritage tourism can also be attributed to historical events that have been dramatised to make them more entertaining. For example, a historical tour of a town or city using a theme such as ghosts or Vikings. Heritage tourism focuses on certain historical events, rather than presenting a balanced view of that historical period. Its aim may not always be the presentation of accurate historical facts, as opposed to economically developing the site and surrounding area. As a result, heritage tourism can be seen as a blend of education, entertainment, preservation and profit.\n\nAnthropology and Ethnology were two major disciplines interested by the life of aborigines, their customs and political structures. Although, the firsts fieldworkers were not interested in expanding the colonization of main European powers, the fact was that their notes, books and field-work notes were employed by colonial officials to understand the aboriginal mind. From that moment on, anthropology developed a strange fascination for the Other's culture. The concepts of heritage and colonization were inextricably intertwined.\n\nAnother problem with heritage tourism is the effect on indigenous peoples whose land and culture is being visited by tourists. If the indigenous people are not a part of the majority, or ruling power in the country, they may not benefit from the tourism as greatly as they should. For example, in Mexico tourism has increased because of the predicted end of the Maya Calendar. However, the indigenous Maya are not benefitting from the increased traffic through the ruins and other cultural landmarks.\n\nHeritage tourism is supported by municipalities through promotion and tourist information in many countries and their administrative units, e.g. cities as Polish Bydgoszcz or Warsaw. \n\nThere are also many forms of presenting selected tourist topics in a harmonized way, for instance European Route of Brick Gothic and many others (Cultural Route of the Council of Europe).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5563057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5563057", "title": "Kansas Sampler", "text": "Kansas Sampler\n\nThe Kansas Sampler Foundation is a public non-profit 501(c) organization. The Foundation is located at the Kansas Sampler Center near Inman, Kansas. According to the organization's web site and publications, the mission is to preserve and sustain rural culture by educating Kansans about Kansas by networking and \"encouraging the support of rural communities.\" The support is generally in the form of encouraging awareness of, and commerce with, rural businesses. Methods include positive messages of motivation encouraging people to celebrate the sunflower state. Founded in 1993 by Mil and Marci Penner, the Kansas Sampler Foundation is based at the Penner family farm.\n\nThe Foundation stresses keeping rural Kansas vigorous. Accentuating \"rural culture elements\" like architecture, art, commerce, cuisine, customs, geography, history, and people — the goal is to get more Kansans to realize (and visit) the treasures in their state. Any one of these elements puts a person, place or thing on the list of places to see. They are reasons to celebrate towns. There is also a checklist to help communities catalog what they have to offer. Small rural towns are seen as critical to the continued character of Kansas.\n\nSupporters sample rural Kansas culture elements by attending the Kansas Sampler Festival. It takes place annually, roving to different Kansas communities every two years. About eight thousand people attended the 2006 festival in Garden City, Kansas. Approximately four hundred volunteers worked together to help put it on. It returned to the Lee Richardson Zoo in the spring of 2007. It has taken place in Inman, Kansas, Pratt, Kansas, Independence, Kansas and Ottawa, Kansas and in Concordia, Kansas, in the years since. \n\nMuch of the work of the Foundation matches the grass-roots, forward-thinking example of businesses and attractions featured at the Kansas Sampler Festival. The currency of awareness is spread in newsletters, and attitudes among member-supporters are tilted towards accentuating positive, mutual success and common survival — indeed a core value of the Foundation. There are group outings, and campaigns by members to trek across Kansas, finding out-of-the-way attractions, people and stories. \n\nThere several areas of interest under the umbrella of the foundation, and many ways to participate. Principal among them is the Kansas Explorers Club. Foundation director Marci Penner said, \"The club helps people know what there is to see and do in the nooks and crannies of the state.\" The Foundation's goal is to get 5,000 Kansas Explorer Club members.\n\nOrganizers believe that \"with that number of explorers driving around the state and spending money in small town cafes and specialty shops and appreciating the historic sites and natural landmarks it will help keep our towns alive and thriving.\"\n\nSimply put, The Kansas Explorers Club is a group of people bound by the common interest of exploring Kansas.\n\nThe Explorers Club newsletter comes out six times a year. In the pages, there are examples of places where the membership might go to explore, to find locally owned businesses, and to experience lesser-known aspects of the state. Suggested day-trips often lead the Explorer on a themed trip, such as visiting suriviving examples of the Old West in Kansas, a western-themed local eatery, and a bed and breakfast that dates back to frontier days. \n\nOne of the guiding principals is that Explorers 'dare to do dirt' - that is, they will seek out elusive best-kept secrets, and don't mind coming home tired, sunburned and with muddy boots for the experience. The stories, cautions, and recommendations from the trips appear in the newsletter. One motto is \"It's About the Journey\" which speaks to exploring.\n\nCelebrated explorers have taken it upon themselves to venture across Kansas for a certain purpose; Explorers might wish to eat lunch in as many towns as possible, or try to drink a beer in every Kansas county. The list of such Explorer accomplishments grew significantly after one explorer in particular gathered nationwide media attention for his crusade.\n\nThere is a secret, ritual greeting among members, and there is an annual 'Happening', specifically for the purpose of lots of Explorers trekking to one spot en masse. \n\nThe Kansas Explorers Club was founded in 1994 already has 1,800 members and is growing every day. The club also plans Group Adventures to places not normally accessible to the public and once a year they have a Grand Expedition. The Grand Expedition is a bus tour designed to help the public see common sights of Kansas with new eyes. Individual membership to the club is $18.61 (the year Kansas became a state). Members receive a membership card, the regular newsletters and information about trips, but they also learn the secret explorer greeting ritual. The club web site is or http://www.explorekansas.org/ . Address and contact information for the Kansas Sampler Foundation is 978 Arapaho Road, Inman, KS 67546 or call (620)585-2374.\n\nThe We Kan! section of the Sampler Foundation's on-line information calls the We Kan! network and newsletter \"a support group and information flow among rural communities to help develop the unique identity of each town and to attract visitors in a way that will help keep towns alive and thriving.\" Furthermore, it states \"It is a group of community leaders, volunteers, and supporters striving to make their communities better. Whatever the focus, We Kan! members enjoy the camaraderie of each other, the sharing of ideas, and a one-for-all, all-for-one attitude.\" according to the Sampler Foundation website . We Kan! awards are presented to distinguished Explorers annually.\n\nThe We Kan! newsletter is published to motivate, and to educate about strategies to help sustain rural Kansas culture. Articles outline the importance of spending in favor of small businesses, in order to keep them alive. The pages often bring tactics for making a difference, however small, in the life of a small town, and explains in some depth how and why rural commerce struggles to survive. There are also pointers as to changes in businesses around the state, and simple inexpensive steps for the individual to take to make a difference. An example is buying postage stamps at smaller post offices, so small towns can keep their U.S. Post Office open, and take a step back from the brink of disappearing.\n\nIn the tiny Woodson County town of Toronto, Kansas - population less than 300 in 2003, there is Lizard Lips Grill and Deli. \"The Kansas Guidebook for Explorers\" \nhttp://kansasguidebook.com/ says the \"combination deli, convenience store, and bait shop\" is a good source for area information. But is also a part of We Kan! lore. Lizard Lips is an example of a small, private business - vital to a community and on the cusp of bankruptcy, until We Kan! came along. They were challenged to go to the store and spend five dollars to keep it vital. The plan worked. The business stands out as a practical example of grass roots success in rural cultural commerce.\n\nMarci Penner founded the Kansas Sampler Foundation with her father, Mil Penner in 1993. The two had seen much of what the state of Kansas had to offer in their travels co-authoring a series of guidebooks, and found themselves championing small town survival not long after. She is the editor and publisher of the foundations newsletters, and her most recent book —\"The Kansas Guidebook for Explorers\" \nhttp://kansasguidebook.com/ — came out in 2005. Marci Penner serves on the state government Rural Kansas Task Force, and is the recipient of the Kansan of the Year award. Penner organized the first Valley Falls Retreat to promote the western heritage of rural Kansas.\n\nKansas Explorer's Club \n\nKansas Sampler Foundation \n\nThe Kansas Guidebook for Explorers \n\nInteractive 2011 Kansas Sampler Festival Guide \n"}

{"id": "2576095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2576095", "title": "Lingua Ignota", "text": "Lingua Ignota\n\nA Lingua Ignota (Latin for \"unknown language\") was described by the 12th century abbess of Rupertsberg, St. Hildegard of Bingen, OSB, who apparently used it for mystical purposes. To write it, she used an alphabet of 23 letters denominated \"litterae ignotae\".\n\nShe partially described the language in a work titled \"Lingua Ignota per simplicem hominem Hildegardem prolata\", which survived in two manuscripts, both dating to ca. 1200, the Wiesbaden Codex and a Berlin MS (Lat. Quart. 4º 674), previously Codex Cheltenhamensis 9303, collected by Sir Thomas Phillipps. The text is a glossary of 1011 words in Lingua Ignota, with glosses mostly in Latin, sometimes in German; the words appear to be a priori coinages, mostly nouns with a few adjectives. Grammatically it appears to be a partial relexification of Latin, that is, a language formed by substituting new vocabulary into an existing grammar.\n\nThe purpose of Lingua Ignota is unknown, and it is not known who, besides its creator, was familiar with it. In the 19th century some believed that Hildegard intended her language to be an ideal, universal language. However, nowadays it is generally assumed that Lingua Ignota was devised as a secret language; like Hildegard's \"unheard music\", she would have attributed it to divine inspiration. Inasmuch as the language was constructed by Hildegard, it may be considered one of the earliest known constructed languages.\n\nIn a letter to Hildegard, her friend and provost Wolmarus, fearing that Hildegard would soon die, asks \"ubi tunc vox inauditae melodiae? et vox inauditae linguae?\" (Descemet, p. 346; \"where, then, the voice of the unheard melody? And the voice of the unheard language?\"), suggesting that the existence of Hildegard's language was known, but there were no initiates who would have preserved its knowledge after her death.\n\nThe only extant text in the language is the following short passage:\nThese two sentences are written mostly in Latin with five key words in Lingua Ignota; as only one of these is unambiguously found in the glossary (\"loifol\" \"people\"), it is clear that the vocabulary was larger than 1011 words. (Higley 2007 finds probable correspondences for two other words.)\n\n\"loifol\" \"people\" apparently is inflected in Latin, yielding \"loifol-um\".\n\nNewman (1987) conjectures the translation\n\nThe glossary is in a hierarchical order, first giving terms for God and angels, followed by terms for human beings and terms for family relationships, followed by terms for body-parts, illnesses, religious and worldly ranks, craftsmen, days, months, clothing, household implements, plants, and a few birds and insects. Terms for mammals are lacking (except for the bat, Ualueria, listed among birds, and the gryphon, Argumzio, a half-mammal, also listed among the birds).\n\nThe first 30 entries are (after Roth 1880):\n\nNominal composition may be observed in \"peueriz\" \"father\" : \"hilz-peueriz\" \"stepfather\", \"maiz\" \"mother\" : \"hilz-maiz\" \"stepmother\", and \"scirizin\" \"son\" : \"hilz-scifriz\" \"stepson\", as well as \"phazur\" : \"kulz-phazur\". Suffixal derivation in \"peueriz\" \"father\", \"peuearrez\" \"patriarch\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Regulations of the profession vary by country and state. The terminology has evolved to include those once known as landscape gardeners, landscape designers, architects, surveyors, or civil engineers. In particular, this includes people from the 19th century who'd practiced before the term \"landscape architect\" was coined. Landscape architecture was also differentiated as a profession in the United States earlier than other parts of the world, but this ambiguity has persisted to the present day. In much of Europe, for example, landscape architecture is not a distinct profession; but there are many significant historical and contemporary examples of projects. Though their influence on landscape architecture may be great, this list precludes gardeners, botanists, writers, theoreticians, ecologists, artists, and others who did not practice landscape design at a site scale and were not trained as a historical 'landscape gardener' or contemporary 'landscape architect.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1984, Haruomi Hosono released the first generally recognized video game soundtrack album, \"Video Game Music\", and the practice experienced its \"golden age\" in the mid-to-late 1980s with hundreds of releases including Buckner & Garcia's \"Pac-Man Fever\", Namco's \"Video Game Graffiti\", and Koichi Sugiyama's orchestral covers of the \"Dragon Quest\" series. The 1990s saw many fewer commercial releases and a shift to promo releases with increasing use of video game samples in rap and hip hop.\n\nThe trend away from vinyl discs continued in the 2000s as fan-made remixes also began to be produced, however by the 2010s the trend reversed and the practice of producing video game soundtracks on vinyl experienced a revival. The vinyl revival of the 2010s has itself been attributed to inspiration in younger music buyers from video games, and it has led to the establishment of video game soundtrack oriented vinyl record labels like Black Screen Records, Data Discs, Brave Wave, and iam8bit, and shifts toward similar releases for labels like Ghost Ramp, Ship To Shore Phonograph Co., and Mondo Tees. In a 2015 article, music journalist Mike Diver suggested that \"this scene within a scene is experiencing boom times\", however he noted that some in the music industry, including Invada manager Redg Weeks, were concerned by the risk of over-saturation of the market. These concerns were later repeated by Jamie Crook of Data Discs, and although he has joined Mondo's Mo Shafeek in arguing that the vinyl medium itself and the related revival is in no way a fad or bubble, in 2017 \"Kotaku\" reported concerns from dedicated video game soundtrack labels that pressing plants were scheduling their manufacturing runs last in order to favor traditional labels.\n\nThe 2000s-2010s revival of interest in this medium has been characterized by releases in limited numbers and promotional albums only available at special events or as pre-order bonuses. In addition, the practice has been adopted by the cult and Indie game scenes, with its proponents citing audio quality, interactivity, artwork, nostalgia, unique content, and the fact that vinyl albums represent tangible aspects of intangible (digitally distributed) products as key elements to what makes vinyl soundtrack albums attractive. Additional considerations for collectors include archival and preservation aspects for older games, examination and recontextualization of the music as a means to expand or further explore the game, and curiosity among audiophiles unfamiliar with video gaming music as a genre. Due to the limited nature of modern releases, many albums are considered highly collectible, with some regularly selling in excess of $100 USD. For Western collectors, additional difficulty is imposed by the cost of importing albums from Japan where the majority were produced during the \"golden age\" of the 1980s.\n\nThe use of grooved vinyl discs as a sequenced/encoded rather than recorded data storage medium enabled the code of full motion videos (FMVs) and even simple video games to be stored in an analog format along with the soundtrack and sound effects. These vinyl data discs took two forms: the FMV-only Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED), and the program sheet. Uncommon even in the early 1980s when the practice was at its height, program sheet game data required that users record from the disc (typically a flexi disc like the \"Interface Age\" \"Floppy ROM\") onto an audio cassette tape which could then be used via the cassette port with microcomputers such as the BBC Micro, Commodore 64, Commodore PET, Commodore VIC-20, Dragon 32/64, ZX81, or ZX Spectrum. The use of CEDs to store video game FMV data was even less common, and required the game console (typically an arcade machine) to select a section of the grooved track to read with its stylus at just the right time for the video to be displayed. The numerous limitations of these techniques (background noise, scratches, and other audio-fidelity problems) contributed to their failure to receive widespread acceptance and video game data stored in this manner remains some of the most difficult to archive and preserve.\n\n"}
{"id": "48053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48053", "title": "Moral relativism", "text": "Moral relativism\n\nMoral relativism may be any of several philosophical positions concerned with the differences in moral judgments across different people and cultures. \"Descriptive\" moral relativism holds only that some people do in fact disagree about what is moral; \"meta-ethical\" moral relativism holds that in such disagreements, nobody is objectively right or wrong; and \"normative\" moral relativism holds that because nobody is right or wrong, we ought to tolerate the behavior of others even when we disagree about the morality of it.\n\nNot all descriptive relativists adopt meta-ethical relativism, and moreover, not all meta-ethical relativists adopt normative relativism. Richard Rorty, for example, argued that relativist philosophers believe \"that the grounds for choosing between such opinions is less algorithmic than had been thought\", but not that any belief is as valid as any other.\n\nMoral relativism has been debated for thousands of years, from ancient Greece and India to the present day, in diverse fields including art, philosophy, science, and religion.\n\nDescriptive moral relativism is merely the positive or descriptive position that there exist, in fact, fundamental disagreements about the right course of action even when the same facts hold true and the same consequences seem likely to arise. It is the observation that different cultures have different moral standards.\n\nDescriptive relativists do not necessarily advocate the tolerance of all behavior in light of such disagreement; that is to say, they are not necessarily normative relativists. Likewise, they do not necessarily make any commitments to the semantics, ontology, or epistemology of moral judgement; that is, not all descriptive relativists are meta-ethical relativists.\n\nDescriptive relativism is a widespread position in academic fields such as anthropology and sociology, which simply admit that it is incorrect to assume that the same moral or ethical frameworks are always in play in all historical and cultural circumstances.\n\nMeta-ethical moral relativism is unpopular among philosophers; many are quite critical of it, though there are several contemporary philosophers who support it.\n\nMeta-ethical moral relativists believe not only that people disagree about moral issues, but that terms such as \"good\", \"bad\", \"right\" and \"wrong\" do not stand subject to universal truth conditions at all; rather, they are relative to the traditions, convictions, or practices of an individual or a group of people. The American anthropologist William Graham Sumner was an influential advocate of this view. He argues in his 1906 work \"Folkways\" that what people consider right and wrong is shaped entirely - not primarily - by the traditions, customs, and practices of their culture. Moreover, since in his analysis of human understanding there cannot be any higher moral standard than that provided by the local morals of a culture, no trans-cultural judgement about the rightness or wrongness of a culture's morals could possibly be justified.\n\nMeta-ethical relativists are, first, descriptive relativists: they believe that, given the same set of facts, some societies or individuals will have a fundamental disagreement about what a person \"ought\" to do or prefer (based on societal or individual norms). What's more, they argue that one cannot adjudicate these disagreements using any available independent standard of evaluation—any appeal to a relevant standard would always be merely personal or at best societal.\n\nThis view contrasts with moral universalism, which argues that, even though well-intentioned persons disagree, and some may even remain unpersuadable (e.g. someone who is closed-minded), there is still a meaningful sense in which an action could be more \"moral\" (morally preferable) than another; that is, they believe there \"are\" objective standards of evaluation that seem worth calling \"moral facts\"—regardless of whether they are universally accepted.\n\nNormative moral relativists believe not only the meta-ethical thesis, but that it has normative implications on what we ought to do. Normative moral relativists argue that meta-ethical relativism implies that we \"ought\" to tolerate the behavior of others even when it runs counter to our personal or cultural moral standards. Most philosophers do not agree, partially because of the challenges of arriving at an \"ought\" from relativistic premises. Meta-ethical relativism seems to eliminate the normative relativist's ability to make prescriptive claims. In other words, normative relativism may find it difficult to make a statement like \"we think it is moral to tolerate behaviour\" without always adding \"other people think \"intolerance\" of certain behaviours is moral\". Philosophers like Russell Blackford even argue that intolerance is, to some degree, important. As he puts it, \"we need not adopt a quietism about moral traditions that cause hardship and suffering. Nor need we passively accept the moral norms of our own respective societies, to the extent that they are ineffective or counterproductive or simply unnecessary\". That is, it is perfectly reasonable (and practical) for a person or group to defend their subjective values against others, even if there is no universal prescription or morality. We can also criticize other cultures for failing to pursue even \"their own goals\" effectively.\n\nThe moral relativists may also still try to make sense of non-universal statements like \"in this country, it is wrong to do X\" or even \"to me, it is right to do Y\".\n\nMoral universalists argue further that their system often \"does\" justify tolerance, and that disagreement with moral systems does not always demand interference, and certainly not aggressive interference. For example, the utilitarian might call another society's practice 'ignorant' or 'less moral', but there would still be much debate about courses of action (e.g. whether to focus on providing better education, or technology, etc.).\n\nMoral relativism encompasses views and arguments that people in various cultures have held over several thousand years. For example, the ancient Jaina Anekantavada principle of Mahavira (c. 599–527 BC) states that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth; and the Greek philosopher Protagoras (c. 481–420 BC) famously asserted that \"man is the measure of all things\". The Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484–420 BC) observed that each society regards its own belief system and way of doing things as better than all others. Various other ancient philosophers also questioned the idea of an objective standard of morality.\n\nIn the early modern era Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677) notably held that nothing is inherently good or evil. The 18th-century Enlightenment philosopher David Hume (1711–1776) serves in several important respects as the father both of modern emotivism and of moral relativism, though Hume himself did not espouse relativism. He distinguished between matters of fact and matters of value, and suggested that moral judgments consist of the latter, for they do not deal with verifiable facts obtained in the world, but only with our sentiments and passions. But Hume regarded some of our sentiments as universal. He famously denied that morality has any objective standard, and suggested that the universe remains indifferent to our preferences and our troubles.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) believed that we have to assess the value of our values since values are relative to one's goals and one's self. He emphasized the need to analyze our moral values and how much impact they may have on us. The problem with morality, according to Nietzsche, is that those who were considered \"good\" were the powerful nobles who had more education, and considered themselves better than anyone below their rank. Thus, what is considered good is relative. A \"good man\" is not questioned on whether or not there is a \"bad\", such as temptations, lingering inside him and he is considered to be more important than a man who is considered \"bad\" who is considered useless to making the human race better because of the morals we have subjected ourselves to. But since what is considered good and bad is relative, the importance and value we place on them should also be relative. He proposed that morality itself could be a danger. Nietzsche believed that morals should be constructed actively, making them relative to who we are and what we, as individuals, consider to be true, equal, good and bad, etc. instead of reacting to moral laws made by a certain group of individuals in power.\n\nOne scholar, supporting an anti-realist interpretation, concludes that \"Nietzsche's central argument for anti-realism about value is explanatory: moral facts don't figure in the 'best explanation' of experience, and so are not real constituents of the objective world. Moral values, in short, can be 'explained away.\n\nIt is certain that Nietzsche criticizes Plato's prioritization of transcendence as the Forms. The Platonist view holds that what is 'true', or most real, is something which is other-worldly while the (real) world of experience is like a mere 'shadow' of the Forms, most famously expressed in Plato's allegory of the cave. Nietzsche believes that this transcendence also had a parallel growth in Christianity, which prioritized life-denying moral qualities such as humility and obedience through the church. (See \"Beyond Good and Evil\", \"On the Genealogy of Morals\", \"The Twilight of the Idols\", \"The Antichrist\", etc.)\n\nAnthropologists such as Ruth Benedict (1887–1948) have cautioned observers against ethnocentricism—using the standards of their own culture to evaluate their subjects of study. Benedict said that transcendent morals do not exist—only socially constructed customs do (\"see\" cultural relativism); and that in comparing customs, the anthropologist \"insofar as he remains an anthropologist ... is bound to avoid any weighting of one in favor of the other\". To some extent, the increasing body of knowledge of great differences in belief among societies caused both social scientists and philosophers to question whether any objective, absolute standards pertaining to values could exist. This led some to posit that differing systems have equal validity, with no standard for adjudicating among conflicting beliefs. The Finnish philosopher-anthropologist Edward Westermarck (1862–1939) ranks as one of the first to formulate a detailed theory of moral relativism. He portrayed all moral ideas as subjective judgments that reflect one's upbringing. He rejected G.E. Moore's (1873–1958) ethical intuitionism—in vogue during the early part of the 20th century, and which identified moral propositions as true or false, and known to us through a special faculty of intuition—because of the obvious differences in beliefs among societies, which he said provided evidence of the lack of any innate, intuitive power.\n\nSome evolutionary biologists believe that morality is a natural phenomenon that evolves by natural selection. In this case, morality is defined as the set of relative social practices that promote the survival and successful reproduction of the species, or even multiple cooperating species.\n\nSome philosophers, for example R. M. Hare (1919–2002), argue that moral propositions remain subject to human logical rules, notwithstanding the absence of any factual content, including those subject to cultural or religious standards or norms. Thus, for example, they contend that one cannot hold contradictory ethical judgments. This allows for moral discourse with shared standards, notwithstanding the descriptive properties or truth conditions of moral terms. They do not affirm or deny that moral facts exist, only that human logic applies to our moral assertions; consequently, they postulate an objective and preferred standard of moral justification, albeit in a very limited sense. Nevertheless, according to Hare, human logic shows the error of relativism in one very important sense (see Hare's \"Sorting out Ethics\"). Hare and other philosophers also point out that, aside from logical constraints, all systems treat certain moral terms alike in an evaluative sense. This parallels our treatment of other terms such as \"less\" or \"more\", which meet with universal understanding and do not depend upon independent standards (for example, one can convert measurements). It applies to good and bad when used in their non-moral sense, too; for example, when we say, \"this is a \"good\" wrench\" or \"this is a \"bad\" wheel\". This evaluative property of certain terms also allows people of different beliefs to have meaningful discussions on moral questions, even though they may disagree about certain \"facts\".\n\n\"Ethical Relativity\" is the topic of the first two chapters in \"The Concept of Morals\", in which Walter Terence Stace argues against moral absolutism, but for moral universalism.\n\nCritics propose that moral relativism fails because it rejects basic premises of discussions on morality, or because it cannot arbitrate disagreement. Many critics, including Ibn Warraq and Eddie Tabash, have suggested that meta-ethical relativists essentially take themselves out of any discussion of normative morality, since they seem to be rejecting an assumption of such discussions: the premise that there are right and wrong answers that can be discovered through reason. Practically speaking, such critics will argue that meta-ethical relativism may amount to moral nihilism, or else incoherence.\n\nThese critics argue specifically that the moral relativists reduce the extent of their input in normative moral discussions to either rejecting the very having of the discussion, or else deeming both disagreeing parties to be correct. For instance, the moral relativist can only appeal to preference to object to the practice of murder or torture by individuals for hedonistic pleasure. This accusation that relativists reject widely held terms of discourse is similar to arguments used against other \"discussion-stoppers\" like some forms of solipsism or the rejection of induction.\n\nPhilosopher Simon Blackburn made a similar criticism, and explains that moral relativism fails as a \"moral system\" simply because it cannot arbitrate disagreements.\n\nThe moral relativist might respond that their conception of morality is more accurate given the provided cross cultural data and that it seems to hold true regardless of the counter arguments of the position's objectors. They also might argue that most moral arguments are a form of the logical fallacy \"Begging the Question\" because it assumed that the moral position being argued is already good and moral and people who argue to \"prove\" their moral position are assuming that the cultural moral norms that they already have are already true. The critics, however, maintain that their conception of morality is, for that exact reason, inadequate. Ultimately critics can do little more than to \"invite\" moral-relativists to re-define \"morality\" in practical or morally realistic terms.\n\nSome arguments come when people question which moral justifications or truths are said to be relative. Because people belong to many groups based on culture, race, religion, etc., it is difficult to claim that the values of the group have authority for the members. A part of meta-ethical relativism is identifying which group of people those truths are relative to. Another component is that many people belong to more than one group. The beliefs of the groups that a person belongs to may be fundamentally different, and so it is hard to decide which are relative and which win out. A person practicing meta-ethical relativism would not necessarily object to either view, but develop an opinion and argument.\n\nCatholic and some secular intellectuals attribute the perceived post-war decadence of Europe to the displacement of absolute values by moral relativism. Pope Benedict XVI, Marcello Pera and others have argued that after about 1960, Europeans massively abandoned many traditional norms rooted in Christianity and replaced them with continuously evolving relative moral rules. In this view, sexual activity has become separated from procreation, which led to a decline in the importance of families and to depopulation. As a result, currently the population vacuum in Europe is filled by immigrants, often from Islamic countries, who attempt to reestablish absolute values which stand at odds with moral relativism. The most authoritative response to moral relativism from the Roman Catholic perspective can be found in \"Veritatis Splendor\", an encyclical by Pope John Paul II. Many of the main criticisms of moral relativism by the Catholic Church relate largely to modern controversies, such as elective abortion.\n\nBhikkhu Bodhi, an American Buddhist monk, has written: \"By assigning value and spiritual ideals to private subjectivity, the materialistic world view ... threatens to undermine any secure objective foundation for morality. The result is the widespread moral degeneration that we witness today. To counter this tendency, mere moral exhortation is insufficient. If morality is to function as an efficient guide to conduct, it cannot be propounded as a self-justifying scheme but must be embedded in a more comprehensive spiritual system which grounds morality in a transpersonal order. Religion must affirm, in the clearest terms, that morality and ethical values are not mere decorative frills of personal opinion, not subjective superstructure, but intrinsic laws of the cosmos built into the heart of reality.\"\n\nThe literary perspectivism begins at the different versions of the Greek myths. Symbolism created multiple suggestions for a vers. Structuralism teaches us the polysemy of the poems.\n\nExamples of relativistic literary works: Gogol's \"Dead Souls\"; \"The Alexandria Quartet\" by Lawrence Durrell; Raymond Queneau's \"Zazie dans le métro\". Or Nuria Perpinya's twenty literary interpretations of the Odyssey.\n\n\n\n"}

The dining concept spread throughout Thailand and into Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nSliced meat (most often pork) is grilled on the dome in the centre while the vegetables and other ingredients, such as fish balls, cook in the soup (also called Thai suki). The hot pot sits on a trough burning charcoal which grills or steams the ingredients. The best foods for this cooking method are pork, chicken, mutton, lamb, seafood, vegetables and mushrooms. The local traditional Thai mu kratha is usually served with “nam chim suki”. Nam chim suki is one of the popular dipping sauces in Thailand. It's well known for using chili sauce as the main ingredient. Some of the restaurants may serve \"nam chim seafood\" for eating with seafood. \nBefore eating \"mu kratha\" a lard has to grilled at the center of the pan so the fat from a lard can cover the surface of the pan. Because of this, the meat won't stick to the pan while being grilled.\n\nSince about 25 years Thailand has a lot of places offering \"mu kratha\" steamboat as it is easy to prepare and suits with a variety of foods.

The U.S. occupation authorities controlled the release of photographs and film footage of these events, while photographers and artists on the ground continued to produce visual representations of the effects of nuclear warfare. Photographer Yōsuke Yamahata began taking photographs of Nagasaki on August 10, 1945 (the day after the bombing), however his photographs were not released to the public until 1952 when the magazine \"Asahi Gurafu\" published them.\n\nIn 1948, the artistic movement of Eaismo, published a manifesto illustrating some aspects of the atomic age and, at the same time, criticizing the industrial use of nuclear power.\n\nIt was a movement of poetry and painting, founded by the Italian artist Voltolino Fontani, aiming to balance the role of men in a society upset by the danger of nuclear radiation. The artistic group was strengthened by the poet Marcello Landi and by the literary critic Guido Favati. In 1948 Voltolino Fontani depicted the disintegration and fragmentation of an atom on canvas, by creating the artwork: \"Dinamica di assestamento e mancata stasi\".\n\nIn 1951 the painters Enrico Baj and Sergio Dangelo created the , criticizing and putting the repetitiveness of painting (as an artistic and commercial phenomenon) in discussion.\nPlenty of Italian artists, in Milan and Naples, and foreigners like Yves Klein, Asger Jorn, Arman, Antonio Saura joined the movement. The main representative of the arte nucleare movement was Piero Manzoni, who in this context, for the first time in his life, put his talent in evidence.\n\nUnlike Eaismo, recommending artists to pursue painting values (and poetry), the arte nucleare movement tried to promote a new form of art in which painting was marginalized.\n\nIn the meantime, Spanish painter Salvador Dalì published the Mystical manifesto (1951), putting catholic mysticism and nuclear themes together.\nIn this period Dalì created artworks like Idillio atomico (1945) and Leda Atomica (1949).\n\nIn 1949 the French artist Bernard Lorjou started to paint his monumental artwork “l’age atomique” (The atomic age). The painting was concluded after one year and is now located in the Centre Pompidou.\n\nThe painter and photographer Eugene Von Bruenchenhein painted the artwork “Atomic age” in 1955, and other apocalyptical and post apocalyptical paintings up to 1965.\n\nThe British sculptor, Henry Moore, created a bronze public sculpture, entitled, Nuclear Energy (sculpture) (1967) that depicted both the fatality of nuclear weapons as well as celebrated the invention of nuclear energy for use as electrical power. The sculpture is located on the grounds of the University of Chicago, where the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction was produced at the Chicago Pile-1, under the oversight of the Manhattan Project and Enrico Fermi. The sculpture is in the form of a hybrid mushroom cloud and human skull.\n\nAfter the March 2011 accident that caused three nuclear reactors to melt down at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan, there have been numerous responses by contemporary Japanese artists, including Shigenobu Yoshida, Tatsuo Miyajima, Shimpei Takeda, Fuyuki Yamakawa, Iri and Toshi Maruki, and Hiroshima bomb survivor, Tadasi Tonoshiki. In 2015 an exhibition was organized in the Fukushima exclusion zone, \"Don't Follow the Wind\" by curator, Kenji Kubota, that includes the work of 12 international artists.\n\nThe cultural critic, Akira Mizuta Lippit, has written that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the most significant photographic and cinematic event of the 20th Century. There have been numerous exhibitions of photographic works, including the 2015 show, Camera Atomica, at the Art Gallery of Ontario, exhibiting two hundred works.\n\n"}

Taghiyev Street 4 (former Gorkogovskaya Street 6), previously owned by Baku millionaire Zeynalabdin Taghiyev, and now the palace building houses the National Museum of History of Azerbaijan. The building was constructed in 1893–1902 by civil engineer Józef Gosławski. The palace was Taghiyev's gift for his wife Sona khanim. The building covers a whole quarter in the central part of the city and has an ancient planning structure. The main symmetrical facade has been built in the forms of Italian Renaissance. \nDuring the construction of the palace, Goslawski used classic order, but some elements of the composition and interiors of the halls were inspired by Azerbaijani architectural traditions. Various architectural styles were used during the construction of the palace.\n\nH.Z. Taghiyev was the customer of Goslawski's architectural works. Examples of these works are Taghiyev's palace, the Muslim girls' school, Taghiyev's villa in Mardakan, Taghiyev's Caucasian-made textile factory building. Goslawski also took part in designing a dwelling house built on the corner of Zarifa Aliyeva Street (former Mercuryev Street), where H.Z.Taghiyev's theater was built. Thus, according to the scale of Baku, a small complex consisting of the architect's works appeared in one of the central areas.\n\nConstruction works were started in 1895 on the streets of Gorkovskaya and Mercuryevskaya. It was assumed from the words inscribed on the building facade. According to some sources, after the completion of the first part of the building, this part was given to Volzhko-Kamsky (Volzhsko-Kamsky) bank. The construction materials used for the building, as well as equipment, furniture, chandeliers and interior were brought from Russia and Western Europe and foreign craftsmen and artists were invited. It was reported that 270 people were employed as engineers, architects, carpenters and other masters at the construction of Taghiyev's palace.\n\nAll equipment inside the palace was imported from Russia, France, America, Germany. In the house heat and cooling systems were installed. 40 thousand rubles of gold were worked out by the masters on the ceiling patterns. The pillars of the palace decorated with diamond and colored mirror bottles, and the floor was covered with natural birch planks from Russia. Furniture from America, pictures and curtains were brought from Germany. Only 1.2 million rubles were spent on construction of the building (without imports of furniture and equipment from abroad).\n\nSince 1914, the Baku Treasury Bank headed by H.Z.Taghiyev was also in the palace. In April 1920, the Bolsheviks, who had taken power in Azerbaijan, confiscated the Taghiyev palace, and a part of the State History Museum had begun to operate. In 1941–1954, the Museum of History was transferred to the Shirvanshahs palace. In 1954, the second floor of the building was returned to the History Museum. On the first floor, the Technical and Medical Documents Archive was placed. All Tagiyev's property was handed over to the Azerbaijani History Museum in just 2000. Taghiyev palace has been reconstructed several times.\n\n"}

When the political opportunity disappears, for example because of a change in the public opinion caused by a rise in insecurity and violence, the movement dissolves.\n\nTarrow lists the qualities of a cycle of contention:\n\nTarrow (1998) notes that \"such widespread contention produces externalities that give challengers at least a temporary advantage and allows them to overcome the weaknesses in their resource base. It demands that states devise broad strategies of response that are either repressive or facilitative, or a combination of the two.\"\n\nHe writes that even defeated or suppressed movements leave some kind of residue behind them, and that effect of social movements, successful or failed, is cumulative in the long term, leading to new protest cycles. This is visible especially when those cycles are analysed in the historical frame. Prior to the 18th century, rebellions were usually aimed at local targets in response to local grievances, usually without many preparations and without allies in different social or ethnic groups. This has however changed in the 18th century, when social movements evolved in West Europe and North America (see also works by Charles Tilly).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41556826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41556826", "title": "Rugby union and apartheid", "text": "Rugby union and apartheid\n\nRugby union and apartheid had a complex relationship. From 1948 to 1994, international rugby relations with the country, and also the non-integrated nature of rugby within South Africa drew frequent controversy. South Africa remained a member of the International Rugby Board (IRB) throughout the apartheid era.\n\nHalt All Racist Tours was established in New Zealand in 1969 to oppose continued tours to and from South Africa. Though contacts were restricted after the Gleneagles Agreement in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 by the British Lions and by France, in 1981 by Ireland, and in 1984 by England. South Africa toured New Zealand in 1981. South Africa were excluded from the first two Rugby World Cups, in 1987 and 1991. Racially selected New Zealand sports teams toured South Africa until the 1970 All Blacks rugby tour allowed Māori to go under the status of 'honorary whites'.\n\nNo other issue, political or otherwise has divided the rugby community so much, at least not since the great schism with rugby league over professionalism. While many rugby fans and commentators would try and body swerve politics, at least politics of a certain kind, the apartheid issue brought it right into the heart of the game, in a very direct, and often physical way. The issue particularly came to the fore in the seventies and eighties. Unlike the split in the rugby world though, the apartheid issue attracted considerable interest from outside the sporting world.\n\nThe issue affected not only black South Africans, but also indigenous New Zealanders and to a lesser extent indigenous Australians. Many major rugby union international sides had few non-white players, but theoretically, a side such as would be frowned upon.\n\nThe famous Scottish rugby commentator, Bill McLaren, devotes an entire chapter to the subject in his autobiography, \"Talking of Rugby\", called \"Barred from the International Feast\". Like many other rugby fans, he expresses contempt for South Africa's \"\"unacceptable racist policy\", but adds \"it has been a disgrace that a world Rugby Union power has been eliminated from world competition for all those years.\"\"\n\nIan Robertson, documented how the Springboks' position slowly deteriorated over the decades, but suggested that the fault lay outwith the rugby fraternity:\n\nApartheid South Africa's last foreign tour was to New Zealand in 1981.\n\nLike most other institutions in South Africa, the South African rugby bodies were divided along racial lines:\n\n\nThere was also the South African Rugby Union (SARU), which was a non-racial body, with a considerable membership. However, only the SARB had any say in international tours, and they alone chose the national team.\n\nAt the end of the 1970s, the SARB took over the SARF and SARA, but Abdul Abbas, leader of SARU refused to co-operate with the new board until the game was integrated at club level and certain political laws scrapped.\n\nThe British and Irish Lions were regular visitors to South Africa until the 1980s, and the less formally segregated colony long before that. Their fondness for South Africa no doubt stemmed from the fact that the first tour they made was to South Africa. They would alternate these tours with tours to Australia and/or New Zealand.\n\nIn the years 1948-1980, the Lions made no less than five tours to South Africa, more or less one for every decade, and half of their total ten tours in this period. Their first tour in this period was in 1955, seven years after the formal inauguration of apartheid. They made further tours in 1962, 1968, 1974 and one final one in 1980. The controversy caused by this matter meant that the Lions would not go back there until their 1997 tour when the South Africa team was ostensibly mixed.\n\nThe Lions would have toured South Africa in 1986 if the regular schedule had been kept to but in December 1985 the South African Rugby Board announced they would not be inviting the Lions side to tour South Africa the following year. Political objections to South Africa's apartheid policies including a potential boycott of the 1986 Commonwealth Games and state of emergency in South Africa at the time lay behind this decision. The squad selected for this International Rugby Board centenary was the closest thing to an official 1986 British Lions side. It was managed by Clive Rowlands and coached by Mick Doyle. The 21 players selected were issued with Lions' blazers and ties and considered to be official British Lions.\n\nNew Zealand has a long history of sporting contact with South Africa, especially through rugby union. Until the 1970s this resulted in discrimination against Māori players, since the apartheid political system in South Africa for most of the twentieth century did not allow people of different races to play sport together, and therefore South African officials requested that Māori players not be included in sides which toured their country. Despite some of New Zealand's best players being Māori, this was agreed to, and Māori were excluded from tours of South Africa. Some Māori always objected to this, but it did not become a major issue until 1960, when there were several public protests at Māori exclusion from that year's tour. The protest group Halt All Racist Tours was formed in 1969. Although this was an issue in which Māori were central, and Māori were involved in the protests, the anti-tour movement was dominated by Pākehā (white New Zealanders).\n\nIn 1973 a proposed Springbok (South African rugby team) tour of New Zealand was cancelled. In 1976 the South African government relented and allowed a mixed-race All Black team to tour South Africa. However, by this time international opinion had turned against any sporting contact with South Africa, and New Zealand faced significant international pressure to cut ties. Despite this, in 1981 the Springboks toured New Zealand, sparking mass protests and civil disobedience. Although Pākehā continued to dominate the movement, Māori were prominent within it, and in Auckland formed the patu squad in order to remain autonomous within the wider movement.\n\nDuring and after the Tour, many Māori protesters questioned Pākehā protesters' commitment to racial equality, accusing them of focusing on racism in other countries while ignoring it within New Zealand. The majority of Pākehā protesters were not heavily involved in protest after the Tour ended, but a significant minority, including several anti-Tour groups, turned their attention to New Zealand race issues, particularly Pākehā prejudice and the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nSouth Africa's isolation in sport began in the mid-1950s and increased throughout the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of their having players of diverse races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the International Table Tennis Federation severed its ties with the all-white South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board. The apartheid government responded by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games.\n\nIn April 2010 it was revealed by Muru Walters that in 1956 Ernest Corbett, Minister of Māori Affairs, had told the Māori All Blacks to deliberately lose to the Springboks \"for the future of rugby\". The Māori team lost 37-0. This was followed by Walters calling for the New Zealand government to apologise for the way it treated Māori rugby players.\n\nForeign complaints about South Africa's bigoted sports brought more isolation. In 1960, Verwoerd barred a Māori rugby player from touring South Africa with the All Blacks, and the tour was cancelled. New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa again.\n\nIn 1961, South Africa left the Commonwealth, signifying a break with many of the major rugby playing nations.\n\nIn 1963, Lloyd McDermott, the first Australian aborigine on the team refused to go on a tour of South Africa, and switched to rugby league as a result.\n\nB. J. Vorster took Verwoerd's place as PM in 1966 and declared that South Africa would no longer dictate to other countries what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for sporting meets, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit Basil D'Oliveira, a Coloured South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. After protests, however, \"Dolly\" was eventually included in the team. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, like that of an England rugby team in 1969/70.\n\nIan Robertson describes the scene at Murrayfield in Edinburgh in 1969:\n\nThere was a huge police presence at the ground, with the terraces behind both sets of goalposts reserved exclusively for officers of the law with standing spectators restricted to just the East Terrace.\n\nIn March 1973, the Argentine government and the Union Argentina de Rugby had a great conflict: the government contested to UAR the permit given to San Isidro Club to visit South Africa, and forced the federal committee of UAR to resign. A new committee was elected on 24 April 1973. In November the government also forbade all visits to South Africa by any Argentine team and any visit of a South African team into Argentina. This ban remained until 1991.\n\nSouth Africa was the indirect cause of the 1976 Olympic boycott. A New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa prompted African countries to demand that the New Zealand Olympic team be excluded from the games. The IOC demurred on the grounds that rugby union was not an Olympic sport and the New Zealand Rugby Union was not affiliated to the New Zealand Olympic Committee. Of 28 African invitees, 26 boycotted the Games, joined by Iraq and Guyana.\n\nIn February, 1977, Danie Craven flew to London to plead for South African rugby's reintegration into the international scene, and to make a last ditch attempt to save the Springboks' scheduled tour of the British Isles in 1978, and the British and Irish Lions tour of South Africa in 1980.\n\nFor the first time I no longer have to circumvent questions, I can at long last look everybody in the face. It is really a disgrace that we in South Africa have tolerated putting the Blacks and Coloured in a place, perhaps the worst place imaginable in our rugby grounds. We are now closing a book and entering a new era. South Africa will never be the same again. You know we must make changes towards a multi-racial deal not to placate or pander to overseas opinion but because it is the right and just thing.\n\nHowever, some, such as Chris Laidlaw, later a Labour MP in New Zealand, had had enough, and believed that rugby's failure to engage with the issue properly was harming the sport:\n\nTimes have changed, however. Youth has begun to write its own rules and by the 1970s the conventions of the rugby community had begun to look a little creaky, its formalities became a bore. The cleavage was brought into sharp relief by the tragic failure of rugby to come to grips with the problem of racism in Southern Africa. The emerging reputation of the rugby player throughout the Anglo-Saxon world as an outdated, boorish oaf – a reputation derived as much from the insensitivities of the rugby community as from the intolerance of the younger generation - was given a new dimension by the quarrels over apartheid in sport. Rightly or wrongly, it has dealt the image of rugby a vicious blow, one from which it may never really recover. South Africa has now been exposed for what it really is, a malignant cancer in the corpus of rugby which has long called for the surgeon's knife. Yet the rugby community - most notably in New Zealand - still remains fatally hesitant when it comes to acting as doctor.\n\nBut there were criticisms of the behaviour of some of the protesters too. Bill McLaren thought apartheid was \"unacceptable\", but:\n\nThough contacts were restricted after the Gleneagles Agreement in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 by the British Lions and by France, in 1981 by Ireland, and in 1984 by England. In 1986, though a Lions tour was cancelled, South Africans played in all-star matches in Cardiff and in London marking the IRB centenary. South Africa was excluded from the first two Rugby World Cups, in 1987 and 1991.\n\nIn 1982 the political relationship between Australia and Argentina was also damaged due to the Falklands War.\n\nThe supposedly turned down its invitation to the 1987 Rugby World Cup, because of its distaste for the \"apartheid\" regime of South Africa. However, South Africa was not invited in the end. While the \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" states that rugby is popular in Great Britain, New Zealand, France, Romania and Australia, it tellingly makes no mention of South Africa. Chris Thau says that France approached the USSR before 1987 on the issue, and that the Soviets said that they would be happy to participate if South Africa was not invited. In the end, South Africa was not invited, but the USSR did not attend either. It has been said that:\n\nNo nation outside the Third World did more than the USSR to oppose \"apartheid\" in sport and have South Africa banned from world sports forums and arenas.\n\nThe Soviets leaned on other nations heavily:\n\nOver the years, Ferasse has resisted Eastern Bloc pressure to break with South Africa. At one point Moscow threatened to set up a rival Federation, but the Rumanians, with whom the French have long had good relationships, stood by France. Moscow tried again later by threatening to call off the v. match in Toulouse in November 1978. Once again Ferasse held firm and the Russians went to France, where they were beaten 29-7\n\nIn September 1981, was due to play the Mid-West in Chicago. To avoid protestors, they drove 77 miles to Racine and played in front of 247 spectators, winning 46-12. By the time they returned to Chicago, none of the protestors knew that the game had happened.\n\nIn 1989 a World XV, sanctioned by the IRB and funded by South African Breweries, played two tests against South Africa in 1989 in celebration of the centenary of the South African Rugby Board (SARB). The Springboks won both, by 20-19 at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town and the second test 22-16 on September 2 at Ellis Park in Johannesburg .\n\nThe 1981 Springboks tour of New Zealand was compromised by demonstrations, and the tourists had to be kept under strict security throughout their visit.\n\nTwo games had to be cancelled. The game at Hamilton in the first week of the tour saw 200 protestors rip down a chain fence, sprinkle tacks all over the pitch and then staged a sit-in on the half way line. At the time, a crowd of 25,000 was watching them playing Waikato. Subsequent matches saw the arrival of barbed wire, and police with batons. The match against South Canterbury at Timaru was cancelled because the authorities thought that they would not be able to control the demonstrations there.\n\nThe final test of the tour was buzzed by a Cessna aircraft - some in fact nicknamed it the \"Crazy Biggles Test\". The plane continually strafed the pitch, and dropped flour bombs, flares and leaflets. All-Black prop Gary Knight was temporarily stunned by a flour bomb.\n\nMusician Bruce Russell received two police convictions as a student leader of protests against the tour. He was at the University of Otago at the time.\n\nIt was a tight game, with Allan Hewson, the New Zealand full-back kicking a long range penalty to win the game 25–22. As Rod Chester and Nev McMillan described the scene:\n\nThere will probably never be another Test match like this. The tension generated by the closeness and importance of the game, combined with the efforts of the protestors inside, outside and above the ground, made for an exhilarating and yet terrifying afternoon.\n\nThe role of the NZ police also became more controversial as a result of the tour.\n\nThe NZRFU constitution contained much high-minded wording about promoting the image of rugby and New Zealand, and generally being a benefit to society. In 1985 the NZRFU proposed an All Black tour of South Africa that remobilised New Zealand protesters. Two lawyers successfully sued it, claiming such a tour would breach its constitution. The High Court stopped the tour.\n\nA \"rebel tour\" not government sanctioned went ahead in 1986, but after that sporting ties were cut, and New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa until the end of apartheid. This followed the intensely controversial 1981 South African tour New Zealand which had provoked nationwide protest and world-wide condemnation. The Cavaliers tour was very controversial within New Zealand and the players found that support for their actions was far less than they had expected. This controversy meant there were no future rugby contacts until the South African apartheid regime ended.\n\nThe All Blacks did not tour South Africa until after the fall of the apartheid régime (1990–1994), although after the 1985 tour was cancelled an unofficial tour took place in 1986 by a team that included 28 out of the 30 All Blacks selected for the 1985 tour, known as the New Zealand Cavaliers but often advertised in South Africa as the All Blacks or depicted with the Silver Fern.\n\nOf the 30 players who had been selected for the All Black tour, only David Kirk and John Kirwan did not join the Cavaliers. The rebel team were widely believed to have received large secret payments—a controversial issue at a time when rugby union was still supposedly an amateur sport \n\nOn their return, the NZRFU barred all the players from participating in the next two All Black tests, and instead selected a new group of players. Most of these replacement players were younger, and were quickly dubbed the \"Baby Blacks\". Those new All Blacks went on to form the basis of one of the most successful periods in All Black rugby, which resulted in many Cavalier players struggling to get their places back.\n\nThe Jaguars consisted mainly of Argentine rugby players, but also with some from Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay and Chile.\n\nWhile many of these countries suffered from dictatorships, they too had sporting bans of a sort. The Jaguars were not officially recognized by Union Argentina de Rugby, a stratagem to elude the prohibition of the Argentine government that since the early 1970s forbade any official relationship between any Argentine sport federation and South African and Rhodesian ones, due to the politics of those countries. This ostracism started in 1971 when the Argentine government forbade the \"Pumas\" to play a match in Rhodesia during the tour in South Africa.\n\nAfter his election in 1994, Nelson Mandela encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the Springboks, as South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup.\n\nPrior to the World Cup in 1995, the Springboks were only seeded ninth and were not expected to dethrone the incumbent champions Australia, who had not lost a game in the preceding 12 months.\n\nDuring the tournament, South Africa defeated Australia, Romania, Canada, Western Samoa and France. They then met New Zealand in the 1995 Rugby World Cup Final at Ellis Park Stadium. Springbok captain Francois Pienaar played on in extra-time despite a calf strain and the Springboks secured a three-point victory with a drop goal from Joel Stransky.\n\nDuring the remarkable post-match presentation ceremony, Nelson Mandela presented Pienaar with the Webb Ellis Cup while wearing a Springbok jersey bearing Pienaar's own number 6. During his acceptance speech, Pienaar made it clear that the team had won the trophy not just for the 60,000 fans at Ellis Park, but also for all 43,000,000 South Africans.\n\nThis was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as F.W. de Klerk later put it, \"Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans.\" Mandela's efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of whites, but also drew criticism from more militant blacks. His estranged wife, Winnie, accused the ANC of being more interested in appeasing whites than in helping blacks.\n\nThese events, along with the relationship between Mandela and Pienaar, were the subject of a 2008 book by John Carlin, \"Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation\", that spotlights the role of the 1995 Cup win in post-apartheid South Africa. Carlin sold the film rights to Morgan Freeman. The result was the 2009 film \"Invictus\", directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Freeman as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as Pienaar.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "588117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=588117", "title": "Saint Ursula", "text": "Saint Ursula\n\nSaint Ursula (Latin for 'little female bear') is a Romano-British Christian saint, died on October 21, 383. Her feast day in the pre-1970 General Roman Calendar is October 21. There is little definite information about her and the anonymous group of holy virgins who accompanied her and on some uncertain date were killed at Cologne. They remain in the Roman Martyrology, although their commemoration does not appear in the simplified Calendarium Romanum Generale (General Roman Calendar) of the 1970 Missale Romanum.\n\nThe earliest evidence of her is a 4th- or 5th-century inscription from the Church of St. Ursula, located on Ursulaplatz in Cologne which states that the ancient basilica had been restored on the site where some holy virgins were killed.\n\nHer legendary status comes from a medieval story that she was a princess who, at the request of her father King Dionotus of Dumnonia in south-west Britain, set sail along with 11,000 virginal handmaidens to join her future husband, the pagan governor Conan Meriadoc of Armorica. After a miraculous storm brought them over the sea in a single day to a Gaulish port, Ursula declared that before her marriage she would undertake a pan-European pilgrimage. She headed for Rome with her followers and persuaded the Pope, Cyriacus (unknown in the pontifical records, though from late 384 AD there was a Pope Siricius), and Sulpicius, bishop of Ravenna, to join them. After setting out for Cologne, which was being besieged by Huns, all the virgins were beheaded in a massacre. The Huns' leader fatally shot Ursula with a bow and arrow in about 383 AD (the date varies).\n\nThe \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" (1911) states that \"this legend, with its countless variants and increasingly fabulous developments, would fill more than a hundred pages. Various characteristics of it were already regarded with suspicion by certain medieval writers, and since Baronius have been universally rejected.\" Neither Jerome nor Gregory of Tours refers to Ursula in his writings. Gregory of Tours mentions the legend of the Theban Legion, to whom a church that once stood in Cologne was dedicated. The most important hagiographers (Bede, Ado, Usuard, Notker the Stammerer, Hrabanus Maurus) of the early Middle Ages also do not enter Ursula under October 21, her feast day.\n\nA legend resembling Ursula's appeared in the first half of the tenth century; it does not mention the name \"Ursula\", but rather gives the leader of the martyred group as \"Pinnosa\" or \"Vinnosa\". Pinnosa's relics were transferred about 947 from Cologne to Essen, and from this point forward Ursula's role was emphasized. In 970, for example, the first \"Passio Ursulae\" was written, naming Ursula rather than Pinnosa as the group's leader (although Pinnosa is mentioned as one of the group's members). This change might also be due in part to the discovery at this time of an epitaph speaking of Ursula, the \"innocent virgin\".\n\nAccording to Geoffrey of Monmouth, a 12th-century British cleric and writer, Ursula was the daughter of Dionotus, ruler of Cornwall. However, this may have been based on his misreading of the words \"Deo notus\" in the second \"Passio Ursulae\", written about 1105. The plot may have been influenced by a story told by the 6th-century writer Procopius about a British queen sailing with 100,000 soldiers to the mouth of the Rhine in order to compel her unwilling groom Radigis, king of the Varni, to marry her.\n\nWhile there was a tradition of virgin martyrs in Cologne by the fifth century, their number may have been limited to between two and eleven, according to different sources. Yet the cleric Wandelbert of the Abbey of Prüm stated in his martyrology in 848 that the number of martyrs counted \"thousands of saints\" who were slaughtered on the boards of the River Rhine. The 11,000 were first mentioned in the late 9th century; suggestions as to where this number came from have included the reading of the name \"Undecimillia\" or \"Ximillia\" as a number, or reading the abbreviation \"XI. M. V.\" as 'eleven thousand [in Roman numerals] virgins' rather than 'eleven martyred virgins'. One scholar has suggested that in the eighth or ninth century, when the relics of virgin martyrs were found, they included those of a girl named Ursula, who was eleven years old—in Latin, \"undecimilia\". This was subsequently misread or misinterpreted as \"undicimila\" ('eleven thousand'), thus producing the legend of the 11,000 virgins. In fact, however, the stone bearing the virgin Ursula's name states that she lived eight years and two months. Another theory is that there was only one virgin martyr, named Undecimilla, \"which by some blundering monk was changed into eleven thousand\". It has also been suggested that \"cum [...] militibus\", 'with [...] soldiers', was misread as \"cum [...] millibus\", 'with [...] thousands'. Most contemporary sources, however, cling to the number 11,000. The \"Passio\" from the 970s tries to bridge conflicting traditions by stating that the eleven maidens each commanded a ship containing one thousand virgins. Implicitly, the legend also refers to the twelve heavenly legions, mentioned in Matthew 23:53.\n\nThe Basilica of St. Ursula in Cologne holds the alleged relics of Ursula and her 11,000 companions. It contains what has been described as a \"veritable tsunami of ribs, shoulder blades, and femurs ... arranged in zigzags and swirls and even in the shapes of Latin words.\" The Goldene Kammer (Golden Chamber), a 17th-century chapel attached to the Basilica of St. Ursula, contains sculptures of their heads and torsos, \"some of the heads encased in silver, others covered with stuff of gold and caps of cloth of gold and velvet; loose bones thickly texture the upper walls.\" The peculiarities of the relics themselves have thrown doubt upon the historicity of Ursula and her 11,000 maidens. When skeletons of little children ranging in age from two months to seven years were found buried with one of the sacred virgins in 1183, Hermann Joseph, a Praemonstratensian canon at Steinfeld, explained that they were distant relatives of the eleven thousand. A surgeon of eminence was once banished from Cologne for suggesting that, among the collection of bones which are said to pertain to the heads, there were several belonging to full-grown mastiffs. The relics may have come from a forgotten burial ground. \n\nIt has also been theorized that Ursula is a Christianized form of the goddess Freya, who welcomed the souls of dead maidens. Other 19th-century scholars have referred to the goddesses Nehalennia, Nerthus and Holda.\n\nNothing reliable is known about the girls said to have been martyred at the spot. A commemoration of Saint Ursula and her companions in the Mass of Saint Hilarion, formerly in the General Roman Calendar on October 21, was removed in 1969, because \"their \"Passio\" is entirely fabulous: nothing, not even their names, is known about the virgin saints who were killed at Cologne at some uncertain time\". However, they are still mentioned in the Roman Martyrology, the official but professedly incomplete list of saints recognized by the Catholic Church, which speaks of them as follows: \"At Cologne in Germany, commemoration of virgin saints who ended their life in martyrdom for Christ in the place where afterwards the city's basilica was built, dedicated in honour of the innocent young girl Ursula who is looked on as their leader.\"\n\n\nCordula was, according to a legend in an edition of the Roman Martyrology presented in an English translation on a traditionalist Catholic website, one of Ursula's companions: \"Being terrified by the punishments and slaughter of the others, Cordula hid herself, but repenting her deed, on the next day she declared herself to the Huns of her own accord, and thus was the last of them all to receive the crown of martyrdom\". In his \"Albert the Great\", Joachim Sighart recounts that, on February 14, 1277, while work was being done at the church of St John the Baptist (\"Johanniterkirche\") in Cologne, Cordula's body was discovered; it was fragrant and on her forehead was written: \"Cordula, Queen and Virgin\". When Albert the Great heard of the finding, he sang mass and transferred the relics. Later, Cordula's supposed remains were moved to Königswinter and Rimini. Cordula's head was claimed by the Cathedral of Palencia. She is listed in the Roman Martyrology on October 22.\n\nThere are striking parallels between the 11th-century legend of Ursula and the story of Sunniva of Selje. Their names were sometimes confused by contemporaries. Both saints were considered to be Christian princesses who fled their homeland by ship in order to postpone or avert an undesired marriage with a pagan king. Both were accompanied by a large group of associates, both became victims of hostile foes. The development of their legends may have been interdependent. The martyrdom of Sunniva, however, took place after the first draft of the \"Passio Ursulae\".\n\n"}

{"id": "54414932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54414932", "title": "Sovereignty goddess", "text": "Sovereignty goddess\n\nSovereignty goddess is a scholarly term, almost exclusively used in Celtic Studies (though parallels for the idea have been claimed in other traditions, usually under the label \"hieros gamos\"). The term denotes a goddess who, personifying a territory, confers sovereignty upon a king by marrying or having sex with him. Some narratives of this type correspond to folk-tale motif D732, \"the Loathly Lady\", in Stith Thompson's \"Motif-Index\". This trope has been identified as 'one of the most well-known and often studied thematic elements of Celtic myth'. It has also, however, been criticised in recent research for leading to 'an attempt to prove that every strong female character in medieval Welsh and Irish tales is a souvenir of a Celtic sovereignty goddess'.\n\nThere is some evidence in Greek and Roman accounts of historical Celtic women that leading women such as Camma and Cartimandua might in antiquity actually have been associated with goddesses. It is also clear that medieval Irish rituals inaugurating a new king sometimes took the form of a \"banais ríghe\" ('wedding-feast of kingship'), because the king was imagined symbolically to be marrying his dominion, and that similar rituals known by the term \"feis\" might involve both sexual activity, and horses (in turn evoking the idea, prominent in modern scholarship, of Celtic horse-goddesses). Most luridly, Giraldus Cambrensis, in his 1188 \"Topographia Hibernica\", claimed that at the inauguration of the king of the Cenél Conaill, the successor to the kingship publicly sexually embraced a white mare. This would then be slaughtered and cooked into a broth in which the king bathed, before he and his people drank it. \n\nHowever, the type-text for the idea of the sovereignty goddess is the medieval Irish \"Echtra Mac nEchach\" ('the adventures of the sons of Eochaid'), in which a hideously ugly woman offers the young men water in return for a kiss. Only Niall kisses her with conviction, and moreover has sex with her, whereupon the woman becomes beautiful and utters the verse\n\nThe story is transparently a pseudo-history composed in support of the claim of the Uí Néill dynasty to dominance in Ireland.\n\nThe fairly strong evidence for a tradition of sovereignty goddesses in early Ireland has led to a fashion in Celtic scholarship for interpreting other female characters as euhemerised sovereignty goddesses, or for arguing that the portrayals of women have been influenced by traditions of sovereignty goddesses.\n\nThis way of reading medieval Celtic female characters goes back to the 1920s, and is related to the myth and ritual school of scholarship. For example, the protagonist of the Welsh \"Canu Heledd\" is sometimes read in this way, and figures as diverse as Guenevere; the Cailleach Bhéirre; Medb; Rhiannon; warrior women such as the Morrígan, Macha and Badb; and the loathly lady of Chaucer's \"Wife of Bath's Tale\" have been viewed in the same light.\n\nHowever, recent scholarship has tended to criticise these assumptions, in both medieval Irish and related material. For example, the portrayals of Gormflaith ingen Donncadha (d. 861), Gormflaith ingen Flann Sinna (c. 870–948), and Gormflaith ingen Murchada (960–1030) have all been read as showing influence from the idea of the sovereignty goddess, but this has been shown to rest on little evidence. Likewise the role of the Empress of Constantinople, who appears in the Middle Welsh \"Peredur\" but not in its French source, has been found to be open to other readings. Even where female characters might historically owe something to traditions of sovereignty goddesses, reading them primarily through this lens has been argued to be limiting and reductive.\n"}

The system consists of a series of story-high trusses spanning the total width between two rows of exterior columns and arranged in a staggered pattern on adjacent column lines. William LeMessurier, the founder Cambridge, Massachusetts engineering firm LeMessurier Consultants has been credited in developing this award winning system as part of his research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nThe staggered truss system came about due to sponsored research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Departments of Architecture and Civil Engineering in the 1960s by U.S. Steel. The research attempted to achieve the same floor-to-floor height with steel as you could with flat plate concrete. The system was presented at the 1966 AISC Conference (the predecessor to the current North American Steel Construction Conference). Additional benefits discovered were high resistance to wind loads and versatility of floor layout with large column-free areas.\n\nIt has been used with on a number of LeMessurier Consultants work in hotels including Lafayette Place Hotel in Boston and the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. Other locations that use this system include the Resorts International\nHotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Embassy Suites hotel in New York City, Baruch College Academic Center in New York City, Trump Taj-Mahal in Atlantic City NJ, and the Renaissance Hotel in Nashville TN\n\nThe staggered truss system for steel framing is an efficient structural system for high-rise apartments, hotels, motels, dormitories, and hospitals. The arrangement of story-high\ntrusses in a staggered pattern at alternate column lines provide large column-free areas for room layouts. These column free areas can be utilized for ballrooms, concourses, and other large areas.\n\nThe staggered truss structural system consists of story-high steel trusses placed on alternating column lines on each floor so that the long axis of one truss is always between the trusses on the floor below. The system staggers trusses on a 12’ module, meaning that on any given floor the trusses were 24’ apart.\n\nThe interaction of the floors, trusses, and columns makes the structure perform as a single unit, thereby taking maximum advantage of the strength and rigidity of all the\ncomponents simultaneously. Each component performs its particular function, totally dependent upon the others for its performance.\n\nThe total frame behaves as a cantilever beam when subjected to lateral loads. All columns are placed on the exterior wall of the building and function as the flanges of the beam, while the trusses which span the total transverse width between columns function as the web of the cantilever beam.\n\nWhile earlier staggered truss systems utilized channels for web diagonals and verticals, today most of the trusses are designed with hollow structural sections (HSS) for vertical and diagonal members because they are more structurally efficient and easier to fabricate. The trusses are fabricated with camber to compensate for dead load and are transported to the site, stored and then erected—generally in one piece.\n\nFabrication of this type of structure requires certified welders and overhead cranes capable of lifting 10 to 15-ton trusses and columns for projects up to 20 stories. Fabrication involves the following components: Columns, Spandrel Beams, Trusses, Secondary Columns & Beams and the Floor System.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "659757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=659757", "title": "Systems science", "text": "Systems science\n\nSystems science is an interdisciplinary field that studies the nature of systems—from simple to complex—in nature, society, cognition, engineering, technology and science itself. To systems scientists, the world can be understood as a system of systems. The field aims to develop interdisciplinary foundations that are applicable in a variety of areas, such as psychology, biology, medicine, communication, business management, engineering, and social sciences.\n\nSystems science covers formal sciences such as complex systems, cybernetics, dynamical systems theory, information theory, linguistics or systems theory. It has applications in the field of the natural and social sciences and engineering, such as control theory, operations research, social systems theory, systems biology, system dynamics, human factors, systems ecology, systems engineering and systems psychology. Themes commonly stressed in system science are (a) holistic view, (b) interaction between a system and its embedding environment, and (c) complex (often subtle) trajectories of dynamic behavior that sometimes are stable (and thus reinforcing), while at various 'boundary conditions' can become wildly unstable (and thus destructive). Concerns about Earth-scale biosphere/geosphere dynamics is an example of the nature of problems to which systems science seeks to contribute meaningful insights.\n\nSince the emergence of general systems research in the 1950s, systems thinking and systems science have developed into many theoretical frameworks.\n\n\nSystems sciences cover formal sciences like dynamical systems theory and applications in the natural and social sciences and engineering, such as social systems theory and system dynamics.\n\nGeneral systems scientists can be divided into different generations. The founders of the systems movement like Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Kenneth Boulding, Ralph Gerard, James Grier Miller, George J. Klir, and Anatol Rapoport were all born between 1900 and 1920. They all came from different natural and social science disciplines and joined forces in the 1950s to establish the general systems theory paradigm. Along with the organization of their efforts a first generation of systems scientists rose.\n\nAmong them were other scientists like Ackoff, Ashby, Margaret Mead and Churchman, who popularized the systems concept in the 1950s and 1960s. These scientists inspired and educated a second generation with more notable scientists like Ervin Laszlo (1932) and Fritjof Capra (1939), who wrote about systems theory in the 1970s and 1980s. Others got acquainted and started studying these works in the 1980s and started writing about it since the 1990s. Debora Hammond can be seen as a typical representative of these third generation of general systems scientists.\n\nThe International Society for the Systems Sciences (ISSS) is an organisation for interdisciplinary collaboration and synthesis of systems sciences. The ISSS is unique among systems-oriented institutions in terms of the breadth of its scope, bringing together scholars and practitioners from academic, business, government, and non-profit organizations. Based on fifty years of tremendous interdisciplinary research from the scientific study of complex systems to interactive approaches in management and community development. This society was initially conceived in 1954 at the Stanford Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences by Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Kenneth Boulding, Ralph Gerard, and Anatol Rapoport.\n\nIn the field of systems science the International Federation for Systems Research (IFSR) is an international federation for global and local societies in the field of systems science. This federation is a non-profit, scientific and educational agency founded in 1981, and constituted of some thirty member organizations from various countries. The overall purpose of this Federation is to advance cybernetic and systems research and systems applications and to serve the international systems community.\n\nThe best known research institute in the field is the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) located in Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States, dedicated to the study of complex systems. This institute was founded in 1984 by George Cowan, David Pines, Stirling Colgate, Murray Gell-Mann, Nick Metropolis, Herb Anderson, Peter A. Carruthers, and Richard Slansky. All but Pines and Gell-Mann were scientists with Los Alamos National Laboratory. SFI's original mission was to disseminate the notion of a separate interdisciplinary research area, complexity theory referred to at SFI as complexity science. Recently, IIT Jodhpur in Rajasthan, India started inculcating system science and engineering to its students through Bachelors, Masters and Doctorate programs. This makes it the first institution to offer system science education to students in India.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28486403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28486403", "title": "The Long Loud Silence", "text": "The Long Loud Silence\n\nThe Long Loud Silence is a science fiction novel written by Wilson A. Tucker. It was first published in hardback edition by Rinehart & Co. in 1952, followed by Dell paperback editions in 1952 and 1954.\n\nAt the Hugo Awards in 1953, The Long Loud Silence placed second to The Demolished Man for the inaugural Best Novel award.\n\nThe story takes place following a nuclear holocaust which wipes out every major city east of the Mississippi and leaves the survivors permanently infected with plague. To prevent the plague from spreading, the army sets up a cordon sanitaire along the Mississippi. The story follows one survivor, Russell Gary, as he attempts to get back across the river.\n\nGary, an army corporal, wakes up in a hotel room in Illinois following a drunken binge. He discovers that the town is deserted except for a handful of corpses and comes to the realization that the country has been subjected to an attack. He discovers one other survivor, a girl of 19. They take a car and, after filling it with supplies, drive toward Chicago, which they find to be in flames. They drive west, only to discover that almost all bridges over the Mississippi have been disabled; the one remaining bridge is guarded by army troops on the western side, who shoot anyone attempting to cross over. The girl abandons him; as he travels further, Gary learns that the nuclear attack was combined with bacteriological warfare which infected the entire population with pneumonic plague. Only those rare individuals with natural resistance have survived, but since they are carriers of the disease, the entire eastern third of the country has been quarantined.\n\nGary is nevertheless determined to cross over. He joins up with a former school teacher, Jay Oliver; they make camp in the hills outside an intact bridge in Kentucky, waiting for the army to allow people across. A woman joins them, trading sex for food. After realizing that the quarantine is permanent, the three decide to go to Florida for the winter where they find a fisherman's cabin on the Gulf coast. After a few months the woman becomes pregnant and expresses her preference for Oliver; Gary decides to leave.\n\nThe following winter he finds himself near the Canada–US border. He awakes one night in an abandoned car and sees a young girl running toward him, pursued by men with guns. Gary shoots the men and saves the girl, who tells him that the men have killed her brother. She leads Gary back to the scene of the murder; he discovers that the body has been partially dismembered and concludes that the men were cannibals. He takes the girl to her home, a farmhouse where both mother and father are still alive. Out of gratitude, the father offers to provide lodging if Gary will guard the farm. Gary agrees and spends the winter there.\n\nThe following spring he sets off toward Washington DC, hoping to find remnants of the government. While passing through Ohio he chances upon a convoy of army trucks under attack. He joins the attack and saves the convoy. The commanding officer thanks him, but makes it clear that he can not join them; they have come from the west, with orders to deliver gold from Fort Knox, and have not been exposed to the virus. Gary offers to fix a tire, but does so in such a way that it slowly loses air; he catches up with the convoy and through a combination of stealth and boldness, kills most of the men and takes one of the trucks. He drives to the bridge on the Mississippi where the men had been planning to cross over. Masquerading as one of them, he is allowed to cross. From there he escapes into the country side; he is labeled an \"enemy agent\" and a manhunt is initiated but he evades capture. However, everyone he comes in close contact with succumbs to the plague. He finally realizes that he has no future in the west and returns over the river, to survive for a number of years until he encounters the girl he had met in Illinois.\n\nDamon Knight wrote that \"The Long Loud Silence\" is a phenomenally good book ... The plotting is close-knit without being contrived; the style is compact and eloquent; the characters, in Faulkner's words, \"stand up on their hind legs and cast a shadow.\" ... The book is honest, courageous, deeply felt.\n\nIn his \"Books\" column for \"F&SF\", he selected Tucker's novel as one of the 10 best sf books of the 1950s.\n\nBoucher and McComas praised Tucker's writing for its \"strikingly effective simplicity.\"\n\nCyril M. Kornbluth also praised the novel, writing that it was \"a book of social criticism which might have had the effect of an \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" or Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\"\". He suggested that the novel was overlooked because publishers chose to market it as science fiction rather than as mainstream fiction.\n\nGroff Conklin, although describing the novel as \"easily readable,\" faulted its lack of \"imaginative richness\" when compared to similar stories.\n\nCyril M. Kornbluth wrote that Tucker's original ending had the protagonist eat his erstwhile mistress, but that Tucker's editor persuaded him to have the two join forces instead. Tucker's original ending was first published, with the author's cooperation, in the Swedish translation of the book that appeared as \"Den långa tystnaden\" [\"The Long Silence\"] in 1979.\n\nCannibalism in popular culture\n"}
{"id": "571630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=571630", "title": "Venus figurines", "text": "Venus figurines\n\nA Venus figurine is any Upper Paleolithic statuette portraying a woman, with fewer images depicting men or figures of uncertain sex, and those in relief or engraved on rock or stones are often discussed together. Most have been unearthed in Europe, but others have been found as far away as Siberia, extending their distribution across much of Eurasia, although with many gaps, such as the Mediterranean outside Italy.\n\nMost of them date from the Gravettian period (26,000–21,000 years ago), but examples exist as early as the Venus of Hohle Fels, which dates back at least 35,000 years to the Aurignacian, and as late as the Venus of Monruz, from about 11,000 years ago in the Magdalenian. These figurines were carved from soft stone (such as steatite, calcite or limestone), bone or ivory, or formed of clay and fired. The latter are among the oldest ceramics known. In total, some 144 such figurines are known; virtually all of modest size, between 3 cm and 40 cm or more in height. They are some of the earliest works of prehistoric art.\n\nMost of them have small heads, wide hips, and legs that taper to a point. Various figurines exaggerate the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva, although many do not, and the concentration in popular accounts on those that do reflects modern preoccupations rather than the range of actual artefacts. In contrast, arms and feet are often absent, and the head is usually small and faceless. Depictions of hairstyles can be detailed, and especially in Siberian examples, clothing or tattoos may be indicated.\n\nThe original cultural meaning and purpose of these artifacts is not known. It has frequently been suggested that they may have served a ritual or symbolic function. There are widely varying and speculative interpretations of their use or meaning: they have been seen as religious figures, as erotic art or sex aids, grandmother goddesses or as self-depictions by female artists.\n\nThe expression 'Venus' was first used in the mid-nineteenth century by the Marquis de Vibraye, who discovered an important ivory figurine and named it \"La Vénus impudique\" or \"Venus Impudica\" (\"immodest Venus\"), contrasting it to the \"Venus Pudica\", Hellenistic sculpture by Praxiteles showing Aphrodite covering her naked pubis with her right hand.\n\nThe use of the name is metaphorical as there is no link between the figurines and the Roman goddess Venus, although they have been interpreted as representations of a primordial female goddess. The term has been criticised for being more a reflection of modern western ideas than reflecting the beliefs of the sculptures' original owners, but the name has persisted.\n\n\"Vénus impudique\", the figurine that gave the whole class its name, was the very first Paleolithic sculptural representation of a woman discovered in modern times. It was found in about 1864 by Paul Hurault, 8th Marquis de Vibraye at the famous archaeological site of Laugerie-Basse in the Vézère valley (one of the many important Stone Age sites in and around the commune of Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil in Dordogne, southwestern France). The Magdalenian \"Venus\" from Laugerie-Basse is headless, footless, armless but with a strongly incised vaginal opening.\n\nFour years later, Salomon Reinach published an article about a group of steatite figurines from the caves of Balzi Rossi. The famous Venus of Willendorf was excavated in 1908 in a loess deposit in the Danube valley, Austria. Since then, hundreds of similar figurines have been discovered from the Pyrenees to the plains of Siberia. They are collectively described as \"Venus figurines\" in reference to the Roman goddess of beauty, Venus, since the prehistorians of the early 20th century assumed they represented an ancient ideal of beauty. Early discourse on \"Venus figurines\" was preoccupied with identifying the race being represented and the steatopygous fascination of Saartjie Baartman, the \"Hottentot Venus\" exhibited as a living ethnographic curiosity to connoisseurs in Paris early in the nineteenth century.\n\nIn September 2008, archaeologists from the University of Tübingen discovered a 6 cm figurine woman carved from a mammoth's tusk, the Venus of Hohle Fels, dated to at least 35,000 years ago, representing the earliest known sculpture of this type, and the earliest known work of figurative art altogether. The ivory carving, found in six fragments in Germany's Hohle Fels cave, represents the typical features of Venus figurines, including the swollen belly, wide-set thighs, and large breasts.\n\nThe majority of the Venus figurines appear to be depictions of women, many of which follow certain artistic conventions, on the lines of schematisation and stylisation. Most of them are roughly lozenge-shaped, with two tapering terminals at top (head) and bottom (legs) and the widest point in the middle (hips/belly). In some examples, certain parts of the human anatomy are exaggerated: abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, vulva. In contrast, other anatomical details are neglected or absent, especially arms and feet. The heads are often of relatively small size and devoid of detail. Some may represent pregnant women, while others show no such signs. It has been suggested that aspects of the typical depiction and perspective, such as the large and often pendulous breasts, emphasis on the upper rather than lower buttocks, and lack of feet and faces, support the theory that these are self-portraits by women without access to mirrors, looking at their own bodies. The absence of feet has led to suggestions that the figures might have been made to stand upright by inserting the legs into the ground like a peg.\n\nThe high amount of fat around the buttocks of some of the figurines has led to numerous interpretations. The issue was first raised by Édouard Piette, excavator of the Brassempouy figure and of several other examples from the Pyrenees. Some authors saw this feature as the depiction of an actual physical property, resembling (but \"not\" depicting) the Khoisan tribe of southern Africa, while others interpreted it as a symbol of fertility and abundance.\n\nRecently, similar figurines with protruding buttocks from the prehistoric Jōmon period Japan were also interpreted as steatopygia of local women, possibly under nutritional stress. (c.f.Jōmon Venus)\n\nThe Venus of Willendorf and the Venus of Laussel bear traces of having been externally covered in red ochre. The significance of this is not clear, but is normally assumed to be religious or ritual in nature—perhaps symbolic of the blood of menstruation or childbirth. Some buried human bodies were similarly covered, and the colour may just represent life.\n\nAll generally accepted Paleolithic female figurines are from the Upper Palaeolithic. Although they were originally mostly considered Aurignacian, the majority are now associated with the Gravettian and Solutrean. In these periods, the more rotund figurines are predominant. During the Magdalenian, the forms become finer with more detail; conventional stylization also develops.\n\nA number of attempts to subdivide or classify the figurines have been made. One of the less controversial is that by Henri Delporte, simply based on geographic provenance. He distinguishes:\n\nAccording to André Leroi-Gourhan, there are cultural connections between all these groups. He states that certain anatomical details suggest a shared Oriental origin, followed by a westward diffusion.\n\nThere are many interpretations of the figurines, often based on little argument or fact.\n\nLike many prehistoric artifacts, the cultural meaning of these figures may never be known. Archaeologists speculate, however, that they may be emblems of security and success, fertility icons, or direct representations of a mother goddess. The female figures, as part of Upper Palaeolithic portable art, appear to have no practical use in the context of subsistence. They are mostly discovered in settlement contexts, both in open-air sites and caves; burial contexts are much rarer.\n\nAt Gagarino in Russia, seven Venus figurines were found in a hut of 5 m diameter; they have been interpreted as apotropaic amulets, connected with the occupants of the dwelling. At Mal'ta, near Lake Baikal in Siberia, figurines are only known from the left sides of huts. The figurines were probably not hidden or secret amulets, but rather were displayed to be seen by all (a factor that may explain their wide geographic spread). An image of excess weight may have symbolized a yearning for plenty and security.\n\nHelen Benigni argues in \"The Emergence of the Goddess\" that the consistency in design of these featureless, large-breasted, often pregnant figures throughout a wide region and over a long period of time suggests they represent an archetype of a female Supreme Creator. Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age people likely connected the female as a creator innately tied to the cycles of nature: women were commonly believed to give birth and their menstrual cycles aligned with lunar cycles and tides.\n\nSome scholars and popular theorists suggest a direct continuity between the Palaeolithic female figurines and later examples of female depictions from the Neolithic or even the Bronze Age. Such views have been contested on numerous grounds, not least the general absence of such depictions during the intervening Mesolithic.\n\nA female figurine which has 'no practical use and is portable' and has the common elements of a Venus figurine (a strong accent or exaggeration of female sex linked traits, and the lack of complete lower limbs) may be considered to be a Venus figurine, even if from after the main Palaeolithic period. Figurines which match this definition, apart from date, have been found in the Neolithic and into the Bronze Age. The period and location that a figurine came from will contribute to the opinion of a given archeologist, such that ceramic figurines from the late ceramic Neolithic may be accepted as Venus figurines, while stone figurines from later periods are not. This is a matter of ongoing debate given the strong similarity between many figurines from the Palaeolithic, Neolithic and beyond. A reworked endocast of a brachiopod from around 6000 BC in Norway has been identified as a late Venus figurine. \n\nThis means that a given female figurine may or may not be classified as a Venus figure by any given archeologist, regardless of its date, though most archaeologists disqualify figurines which date from after the Paleolithic, even though their purpose could have been the same. For instance, the Mehrgarh figurine has all of the common characteristics of a venus stone figurine, including large breasts and incomplete legs, however it came from what is now Pakistan and also dates to 3000 BCE, which lies after the beginning of the Bronze Age.\n\n\n\n"}
