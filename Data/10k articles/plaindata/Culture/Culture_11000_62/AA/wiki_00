This is the first cinema rendition of the story, directed by Michael Anderson and starring Edmond O'Brien as protagonist Winston Smith, and featuring Donald Pleasence, Jan Sterling, and Michael Redgrave. The character O'Brien, the antagonist, was renamed \"O'Connor\", due to the shared surname of the actor Edmond O'Brien.\n\nThe film was distributed in 1956 on a double bill with another British sci-fi film, \"The Gamma People\". After the customary distributor agreement expired, the film was withdrawn from theatrical and TV distribution channels by Orwell's estate and has not been obtainable legally for many years.\n\nIn 1954, Peter Cushing and Andre Morell starred in a BBC-TV made-for-TV adaptation which was extremely popular with British audiences, leading to the production of the 1956 O'Brien theatrical film version. Pleasence had also appeared in the BBC television version, playing the character of Syme, which for the film was amalgamated with that of Parsons.\n\nLike the earlier film adaption of \"Animal Farm\", \"1984\" was secretly funded by the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nA voice-over narrator explains that in the mid-1950s, a nuclear war and devastation of Earth gave rise to three powerful police superstates continually at war with one another: Oceania, ruled by the omnipresent Big Brother; Eurasia ruled by the communists, and finally East Asia ruled by a sub-branch of socialists. By 1984, London, with its bomb-proof ministry, was designated as the capital of Airstrip One, a province of Oceania.\n\nIn the spring of 1984, as the sound of air raid sirens wail above the London streets, Winston Smith (O'Brien), a member of the elite Outer Party, takes cover in an underpass and encounters Julia (Sterling), a woman he suspects may be a member of the Thought Police. After the air raid sirens abate, Winston goes to his apartment, where an electronic surveillance eye examines the contents of his briefcase. Smuggling a small black diary past the eye, Winston begins to write down the subversive thoughts he fears to say aloud. Winston's reverie is interrupted when Selina Parsons (Wolveridge), a little girl who lives next door and is in training to become a spy for Big Brother, enters his apartment to practice denouncing him as a traitor. After his daughter heads off for her spy indoctrination, Robert Parsons (Pleasence), Selina's father, invites Winston to join him at the local Chestnut Tree café for some tea.\n\nAt the cafe, Winston and Parsons spot Rutherford and Jones, two Outer Party traitors who have been rehabilitated by the government's Ministry of Love. Afterwards, Winston goes to a junk shop in an impoverished section of the city to wonder at the beauteous objects of yesteryear that are now deemed worthless. As the elderly proprietor (Kossoff) shows Winston his wares, Julia enters the shop, sending Winston scurrying into the street, where he is stopped by the police and ordered to report to Administration the next morning.\n\nAt the Administration the next day, a party officer reprimands Winston for socializing with the common masses (the Proles). Winston then proceeds to his job at the Records Department at the Ministry of Truth, where he revises history to vindicate Big Brother's pronouncements. When Winston discovers a photo that would prove Jones and Rutherford innocent, O'Connor (Redgrave), Winston's superior and a minister of the exclusive Inner Party, instructs him to destroy it.\n\nThat evening, at a political rally to foment hate against Eurasia, Julia passes Winston a note professing her love to him. Later, they arrange to meet Sunday in a meadow outside London, far from the prying microphones and monitors of Big Brother. There, they touch each other, an act prohibited by the Anti-Sex League and proceed to make love (off-camera).\n\nTwo weeks later, Winston and Julia meet clandestinely at a bell tower, and Winston proposes renting a room at the junk store, one of the few places free of the omnipresent monitors. The elderly proprietor honors their request and sets up a cozy bedroom and kitchen for them. In the sanctity of their quarters, after Julia removes her austere party uniform and dons a frilly blouse, Winston confides that he believes O'Connor may be a member of the Underground.\n\nOne night, while leafing through his diary, Winston finds a note written in O'Connor's handwriting that reads \"down with Big Brother.\" The next day at work, O'Connor tells Winston to come by his apartment that evening to pick up some documents. Convinced that O'Connor represents their only hope to break free of the tyranny of Big Brother, Julia and Winston go to his apartment and declare that they want to join the Underground. After drinking a toast to the demise of Big Brother, O'Connor asks if there is anything they would not do for the Underground and Julia replies that she would not be separated from Winston. O'Connor then instructs Winston to carry an empty briefcase with him at all times.\n\nA few days later, during a rally to launch Hate Week, a man in the crowd switches briefcases with Winston, and when Winston opens the case, he finds a copy of a treatise by Calidor, the alleged leader of the Underground. Back in their secret room, Julia muses that only love can defeat Big Brother and thus provide hope for the future. At that moment, a telescreen hidden behind a mirror breaks its silence to condemn Julia's sentiments, after which, the police, accompanied by the elderly proprietor, burst in to arrest them.\n\nAt the Ministry of Love, Winston is confined in a pit-like room for hours (and probably days). Soon after, Parsons is thrown into the pit, his daughter having denounced him for muttering in his sleep \"Down with Big Brother.\" After Parsons is taken away, O'Connor enters the room and reveals himself to be a covert agent of the state who has been investigating Winston for some time. Under O'Connor's direction, Winston is subjected to a brainwashing campaign. Still resistant after a series of electroshock treatments, Winston declares that despite his continuing loyalty to the state, the party will never eradicate his love for Julia. O'Connor then ushers Winston into the dreaded Room 101, where each prisoner must confront their own personal terror. Having ascertained that Winston's worst fear is being eaten alive by rats, O'Connor confines him in a room filled with the squealing rodents, after which Winston breaks down and begs them to feed Julia to the rodents instead. His will broken, the door opens and Winston falls sobbing into O'Connor's arms.\n\nAfter O'Connor authorizes his release, Winston mindlessly wanders through the streets, where he spots Julia, her eyes vacant as his, seated on a bench. After they confess their mutual betrayal, Big Brother broadcasts that the Eurasian army has been routed in battle and that the war will be soon over. In the final shot, the rehabilitated and brainwashed Winston and Julia then fervently join the crowd in cheering \"Long live Big Brother!\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1205439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1205439", "title": "Automaticity", "text": "Automaticity\n\nAutomaticity is the ability to do things without occupying the mind with the low-level details required, allowing it to become an automatic response pattern or habit. It is usually the result of learning, repetition, and practice. Examples of tasks carried out by 'muscle memory' often involve some degree of automaticity.\n\nExamples of automaticity are common activities such as walking, speaking, bicycle-riding, assembly-line work, and driving a car (the last of these sometimes being termed \"highway hypnosis\"). After an activity is sufficiently practiced, it is possible to focus the mind on other activities or thoughts while undertaking an automatized activity (for example, holding a conversation or planning a speech while driving a car).\n\nJohn Bargh (1994), based on over a decade of research, suggested that four characteristics usually accompany automatic behavior:\n\nBargh states that these are simply common characteristics; not all are needed for a process to be considered automatic. For instance, stereotype activation has been described as an automatic process: it is unintentional and efficient, requiring little effort. However stereotype activation is accompanied by above chance awareness and if conflicting processing goals are available then it becomes controlled. Therefore, stereotype activation only satisfies two of Bargh's criteria, but is still considered to be an example of automatic processing.\n\nLaBerge and Samuels (1974) helped explain how reading fluency develops. Automaticity refers to knowing how to perform some arbitrary task at a competent level without requiring conscious effort — \"i.e.\", it is a form of unconscious competence.\n\nMoreover, if the student is automatic or is \"a skilled reader, multiple tasks are being performed at the same time, such as decoding the words, comprehending the information, relating the information to prior knowledge of the subject matter, making inferences, and evaluating the information's usefulness to a report he or she is writing\" (Samuels). It is essential to understand automaticity and how it is achieved to better a student's performance. This is important for teachers because automaticity should be focused on in early years to ensure higher level reading skills in adolescence.\n\nAutomaticity can be disrupted by explicit attention when the devotion of conscious attention to the pattern alters the content or timing of that pattern itself. This phenomenon is especially pronounced in situations that feature high upside and/or downside risk and impose the associated psychological stress on one's conscious mind; one's performance in these situations may either \"a\") be unimpaired or even enhanced (\"flow\") or \"b\") deteriorate (\"choke\").\n\nThis effect has been named the \"centipede effect\" after the fable of the \"Centipede's dilemma\", where a toad immobilises a centipede simply by asking it how it walks. The centipede's normally unconscious locomotion was interrupted by conscious reflection on it. The psychologist George Humphrey referred to this parable in his 1923 \"The story of man's mind\": \"No man skilled at a trade needs to put his constant attention on the routine work,\" he wrote. \"If he does, the job is apt to be spoiled.\"\n\nIn \"Influence\", Robert Cialdini's book about social psychology and influence tactics, Cialdini explains how common automatic response patterns are in human behavior, and how easily they can be triggered, even with erroneous cues. He describes an experiment conducted by social psychologists Langer, Chanowitz, and Blank which illustrates how compliant people will be with a request if they hear words that sound like they are being given a reason, even if no actual reason is provided. The experimenters approached people standing in line to use a photocopier with one of three requests:\n\nWhen given the request plus a reason, 94% of people asked complied with the request. When given the request without a reason, only 60% complied. But when given the request with what sounds like a reason but isn't, compliance jumped back to 93%. Langer, Chanowitz, and Blank are convinced that most human behavior falls into automatic response patterns.\n\nHowever, when the request was made larger (20 pages instead of 5), subjects expected a sound reason before complying, as illustrated in the table.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9490727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9490727", "title": "BioArt", "text": "BioArt\n\nBioArt is an art practice where humans work with live tissues, bacteria, living organisms, and life processes. Using scientific processes such as biotechnology (including technologies such as genetic engineering, tissue culture, and cloning) the artworks are produced in laboratories, galleries, or artists' studios. The scope of BioArt is considered by some artists to be strictly limited to \"living forms\", while other artists would include art that uses the imagery of contemporary medicine and biological research, or require that it address a controversy or blind spot posed by the very character of the life sciences.\n\nAlthough BioArtists work with living matter, there is some debate as to the stages at which matter can be considered to be alive or living. Creating living beings and practicing in the life sciences brings about ethical, social, and aesthetic inquiry. The phrase \"BioArt\" was coined by Eduardo Kac in 1997 in relation to his artwork \"Time Capsule\". Although it originated at the end of the 20th century, through the works of pioneers like Joe Davis, Marta de Menezes and the artists hosted by Symbiotica, BioArt is more widely practiced now.\n\nBioArt is often intended to be shocking or humorous. One survey of the field, \"Isotope: A Journal of Literary Science and Nature Writing\", puts it this way: \"BioArt is often ludicrous. It can be lumpy, gross, unsanitary, sometimes invisible, and tricky to keep still on the auction block. But at the same time, it does something very traditional that art is supposed to do: draw attention to the beautiful and grotesque details of nature that we might otherwise never see.\"\n\nWhile raising questions about the role of science in society, \"most of these works tend toward social reflection, conveying political and societal criticism through the combination of artistic and scientific processes.\"\n\nWhile most people who practice BioArt are categorized as artists in this new media, they can also be seen as scientists, since the actual medium within a work pertains to molecular structures, and so forth. Because of this dual-acceptance, the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard University invites anyone to submit works based on scientific or artistic value. This can encourage anyone to submit work they strongly respond to.\n\nThe laboratory work can pose a challenge to the artist, at first, as the environment is often foreign to the artist. While some artists have prior scientific training, others must be trained to perform the procedures or work in tandem with scientists who can perform the tasks that are required. Bio artists often use formations relating to or engaged with science and scientific practices, such as working with bacteria or live-tissue.\n\nMuch of the art involves tissue-culturing and transgenics, a term for a variety of genetic engineering processes through which genetic material from one organism is altered by the addition of synthesized or transplanted genetic material from another organism.\n\nIn 2000, Eduardo Kac commissioned the creation of a transgenic GFP bunny as part of a piece called GFP Bunny. \"The PR campaign included a picture of Kac holding a white rabbit and another, iconic image of a rabbit photographically enhanced to appear green.\"\n\nThe Tissue Culture & Art Project in collaboration with Stelarc grew a 1/4 scale replica of an ear using human cells. The project was carried out at Symbiotica: the Art & Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology, University of Western Australia.\n\nThe scope of the term BioArt is a subject of ongoing debate. The primary point of debate centers around whether BioArt must necessarily involve manipulation of biological material, as is the case in microbial art which by definition is made of microbes. A broader definition of the term would include work that addresses the social and ethical considerations of the biological sciences. Under these terms BioArt as a genre has many crossovers with fields such as critical or speculative design. This type of work often reaches a much broader general audience, and is focused on starting discussions in this space, rather than pioneering or even using specific biological practices. Examples in this space include Ray Fish shoes, which advertised shoes made and patterned with genetically engineered stingray skin, and BiteLabs, a biotech startup that attempted to make salami out of meat cultured from celebrity tissue samples.\n\nBioArt has been scrutinized for its apparent lack of ethics. \"USA Today\" reported that animal rights groups accused Kac and others of using animals unfairly for their own personal gain, and conservative groups question the use of transgenic technologies and tissue-culturing from a moral standpoint.\n\nAlka Chandna, a senior researcher with PETA in Norfolk, Virginia, has stated that using animals for the sake of art is no different from using animal fur for clothing material. \"Transgenic manipulation of animals is just a continuum of using animals for human end, regardless of whether it is done to make some sort of sociopolitical critique. The suffering and exacerbation of stress on the animals is very problematic.\"\n\nHowever, many BioArt projects deal with the manipulation of cells and not whole organisms, such as \"Victimless Leather\" by Symbiotica. \"An actualized possibility of wearing 'leather' without killing an animal is offered as a starting point for cultural discussion. Our intention is not to provide yet another consumer product, but rather to raise questions about our exploitation of other living beings.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "351429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=351429", "title": "Close reading", "text": "Close reading\n\nIn literary criticism, close reading is the careful, sustained interpretation of a brief passage of a text. A close reading emphasizes the single and the particular over the general, effected by close attention to individual words, the syntax, the order in which the sentences unfold ideas, as well as formal structures. A truly attentive close reading of a two-hundred-word poem might be thousands of words long without exhausting the possibilities for observation and insight.\n\nLiterary close reading and commentaries have extensive precedent in the exegesis of religious texts, and more broadly, hermeneutics of ancient works. For example, Pazand, a genre of middle Persian literature, refers to the \"Zend\" (literally: 'commentary'/'translation') texts that offer explanation and close reading of the Avesta, the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism. The scriptural commentaries of the Talmud offer a commonly cited early predecessor to close reading. In Islamic studies, the close reading of the Quran has flourished and produced an immense corpus. But the closest religious analogy to contemporary literary close reading, and the principal historical connection with its birth, is the rise of the higher criticism, and the evolution of textual criticism of the Bible in Germany in the late eighteenth century.\n\nIn the practice of literary studies, the technique of close reading emerged in 1920s Britain in the work of I. A. Richards, his student William Empson, and the poet T.S. Eliot, all of whom sought to replace an \"impressionistic\" view of literature then dominant with what Richards called a \"practical criticism\" focused on language and form. American New Critics in the 1930s and 1940s anchored their views in similar fashion, and promoted close reading as a means of understanding that the autonomy of the work (often a poem) mattered more than anything else, including authorial intention, the cultural contexts of reception, and most broadly, ideology.For these critics, including Cleanth Brooks, John Crowe Ransom, and Allen Tate, only close reading, because of its attentiveness to the nuances and interrelation of language and form, could address the work in its complex unity.Their influence on American literary criticism and English departments held sway for several decades, and even after New Criticism faded from prominence in American universities in the waning years of the Cold War, close reading remained a fundamental, almost naturalized, skill amongst literary critics.By the turn of the 21st century, efforts to historicize New Critical aesthetics and its apolitical pretense prompted scholars, especially in departments of English, to debate the fate of close reading, asking about its status as a critical practice.\n\nIn two of its 2010 bulletins, the American Departments of English (ADE) featured a cluster of articles that attempted to take stock of what the 21st century held for close reading. The articles were motivated, as all of the scholars remarked, by the changes they had observed in the work of their colleagues and students -- as well as in contemporary culture -- that made them think again about why close reading mattered to the study of literature. Jonathan Culler noted that because the discipline had taken close reading for granted, it had disappeared from discussions of the goals of literary criticism.For Culler, as for Jane Gallop, that absence needed remedying, and therefore signaled an opportunity for departments of English to renew -- in order to capitalize on -- one of the more distinctive traits of studying literature. If New Criticism and its isolationist stance had given away to the politicization of literary studies, and if technological developments were changing the very ways in which people read, Culler and Gallop emphasized that the signature of close reading, meticulous attention to the workings of language and form, still had value.N. Katherine Hayles and John Guillory, meanwhile, each interested in the impact of digital media on the ways people read, argued that close reading skills were not only translatable to the digital context, but could also exist productively alongside the hyper-reading that web interfaces and links had generated.\n\nWhile the New Criticism popularized close reading in universities, it tended to emphasize its principles and offer extended examples rather than prescribe specific methods and practices. This tendency towards what Vincent B. Leitch calls \"canonical statements\" appeared in essays and book-length studies, from John Crowe Ransom's \"The New Criticism\" (1949) and Allen Tate's \"A Note on Autotelism\" (1949), to Cleanth Brooks' \"The Well Wrought Urn\" (1947), Rene Wellek and Austin Warren's \"Theory of Literature\" (1949), and W.K. Wimsatt's \"The Verbal Icon\" (1954). The first ten chapters of \"The Well Wrought Urn\" thus focus individually on poems across British literary history (John Donne, William Shakespeare, John Milton, Alexander Pope, Thomas Gray, John Keats, William Wordsworth, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, W.B. Yeats, and T.S. Eliot) before concluding with \"The Heresy of Paraphrase,\" in which Brooks abstracts the premises on which his analyses rest. Meanwhile, when Wellek and Warren describe their preference for an \"intrinsic\" study of literature in \"Theory of Literature\", they refer to examples of elements they claim are crucial to a work -- from euphony, rhythm, and meter to image, metaphor, and myth -- and cite concrete examples of these drawn from literary history, but do not indicate steps by which readers might translate such thinking into their own analyses. Wimsatt takes a mixed approach in \"The Verbal Icon\", combining theoretical chapters (\"The Intentional Fallacy,\" \"The Affective Fallacy\") with those that discuss concerns he feels are necessary to the study of poetry (\"The Concrete Universal,\" \"Symbol and Metaphor,\" \"The Substantive Level,\" \"One Relation of Rhyme to Reason,\" \"When is Variation 'Elegant'?\",\"Verbal Style: Logical and Counterlogical\"), but he too leaves it to his readers to imagine how they might deploy these views.\n\nAs Culler notes in his essay for the 2010 bulletin of the American Departments of English, this tendency not to make statements of method meant that most students of the New Critics learned by example. Thus in the New Critical classroom, \"the charismatic pedagogue could pose a question you had not thought of about relations between form and meaning or point to a textual difficulty that had escaped your attention.\" More than fifty years later, this \"closeness of close reading\" remains vital to the work of more recent thinkers whose thinking has contributed to the radical changes in literary studies and displaced New Criticism. Of these he cites his contemporary, the deconstructionist Barbara Johnson, who stands out for her claim that the value of close reading lies in its capacity for taking seriously what does not immediately make sense.Well aware of the stark differences between New Criticism and deconstruction, Culler here brings the two together, suggesting that their shared investments indicate an understanding of close reading worth maintaining.\n\nIn French criticism, close reading is similar to \"explication de texte\", the tradition of textual interpretation in literary study, as proposed by Gustave Lanson. As an analytical technique, \"close reading\" compares and contrasts the concept of \"distant reading\", the technique for “understanding literature, not by studying particular texts, but by aggregating and analyzing massive amounts of data”, as described, by Kathryn Schulz, in “What is Distant Reading?”, an article about the literary scholar Franco Moretti.\n\nBrooks's discussion of John Keats's \"Ode to a Grecian Urn\" embodies his use of close reading. In \"Keats's Sylvan Historian,\" he finds the controversy over the poem's famous lines misplaced, and insists instead that \"the ambiguity\" of \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty -- that is all/Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\" is best understood as an expression of the urn itself (151-153). The poem pursues this ambiguity, he writes, in lines that describe the urn on the one hand as a \"bride of quietness\" and a \"foster-child of silence\" and on the other, a \"sylvan historian\" (155). In this way the poem describes the urn in paradoxical terms much as the urn utters a paradoxical line. Brooks then pursues this logic by considering how \"sylvan historian\" might not only describe the urn as a kind of historian but also the kind of history the urn is said to tell. Further, if he claims that this history is uncertain because it's not clear \"what men or gods\" feature in it, he continues that line of thinking as he proceeds through the ode's stanzas: when he emphasizes that the \"unheard melodies\" of the figures depicted on the urn's face are \"sweeter than any audible music,\" that \"action goes on though the actors are motionless,\" that \"the maiden, always to be kissed, never actually kissed,\" that the \"boughs...cannot shed their leaves,\" and when he claims that this \"ironic undercurrent\" only increases over the course of the poem, to culminate in those infamous lines (156-159, 164). From following the poem in this way, Brooks arrives at the assertion that his interpretation is \"derived from the context of the \"Ode\" itself\" (164).\n\nBrooks's close reading is typical of the New Critical investment in the textual object alone. Yet scholars have also found close reading productive for more politically and socially invested work, thereby refusing the New Critical belief in literary transcendence while seizing on the care with which it treated textuality. In \"The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination\" (1979), best known as one of the earliest statements of feminist literary criticism, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar deployed close reading to make a case for the distinctiveness of the female literary imagination. The sixteen chapters of \"Madwoman\" thus pursue their arguments -- that women writers expressed their anxiety about authorship, their rage over being constrained to docile femininity, their canny encoding of their patriarchal critique -- with the attention to language, imagery, and form Gilbert and Gubar had been trained to wield as graduate students in the late 1960s. New Critical echoes are thus evident in the individual chapters devoted to close readings of Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\", Emily Bronte's \"Wuthering Heights\", Charlotte Bronte's \"The Professor\", \"Jane\" \"Eyre\", \"Shirley\", and \"Villette\", but so is the political innovation. Reviewers -- academic and mainstream -- recognized this trait, describing the two scholars as “gnostic heretics who claim to have found the secret code that unlocks the mysteries in old texts” (Schreiber 11)and their interpretations as a \"skillful joint peeling away of the layers\" of women's writing\" (129).\n\nIn an even more extreme example, Jacques Derrida in \"Ulysses Gramophone\" devotes more than eighty pages to the word \"yes\" in James Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\", an effort which J. Hillis Miller describes as a \"hyperbolic, extravagant... explosion\" of the technique of close reading.\n\nThe push for more close-reading instruction in primary and secondary education is partially due to increased feedback from college professors in the early-mid 2000s that students were arriving in university classrooms with few comprehension skills. The increased demand for students to acquire concrete skills in high school that they would need in transitioning to higher education and to adult life culminated in the creation of the Common Core State Standards in 2009. Since then, there has been a push for English Language Arts teachers, especially at the secondary level, to help students develop close-reading strategies. Several of the English Language Arts (ELA) Standards for Reading Literature require students to be able to cite direct textual evidence, and to analyze words in context. For example, CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.9-10.4 asks students to \"Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in the text, including figurative and connotative meanings; analyze the cumulative impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone (e.g., how the language evokes a sense of time and place; how it sets a formal or informal tone).\"\n\nToday, as most states have adopted the Common Core Standards, there is an increasing number of resources designed to help teachers instruct and implement close-reading strategies in their classrooms. In 2012, Kylene Beers and Robert E. Probst published \"Notice & Note: Strategies for Close Reading\", which established six \"signposts\" that alert readers to significant moments in a work of literature and encourage students to read closely. \n\nAnother resource, developed by Beth Burke (NBCT) for the \"Tampa Bay Times\" NIE (Newspaper in Education), presents the steps involved in close reading and how to scaffold the strategies for students. She recommends using the Gradual Release Model in instruction, beginning by modeling a close reading in front of the class, then having students work on the strategy in groups before attempting it alone. \n\nAdditional ways to support students in close-reading instruction include providing graphic organizers that help them group their ideas with textual evidence.\n\n"}

Verbal context influences the way an expression is understood; hence the norm of not citing people out of context. Since much contemporary linguistics takes texts, discourses, or conversations as the object of analysis, the modern study of verbal context takes place in terms of the analysis of discourse structures and their mutual relationships, for instance the coherence relation between sentences.\n\nNeurolinguistic analysis of context has shown that the interaction between interlocutors defined as parsers creates a reaction in the brain that reflects predictive and interpretative reactions. It can be said then, that mutual knowledge, co-text, genre, speakers, hearers create a neurolinguistic composition of context.\n\nTraditionally, in sociolinguistics, social contexts were defined in terms of objective social variables, such as those of class, gender, age or race. More recently, social contexts tend to be defined in terms of the social identity being construed and displayed in text and talk by language users. Influenced by space.\n\nThe influence of context parameters on language use or discourse is usually studied in terms of \"language variation\", style or register (see Stylistics). The basic assumption here is that language users adapt the properties of their language use (such as intonation, lexical choice, syntax, and other aspects of \"formulation\") to the current communicative situation. In this sense, language use or discourse may be called more or less 'appropriate' in a given context. It is the language or derigitave terms surrounding set paragraph, novel or article.\n\nIn the theory of sign phenomena, adapted from that of Charles Sanders Peirce, which forms the basis for much contemporary work in linguistic anthropology, the concept of context is integral to the definition of the index, one of the three classes of signs comprising Peirce's second trichotomy. An index is a sign which signifies by virtue of \"pointing to\" some component in its context, or in other words an indexical sign is related to its object by virtue of their co-occurrence within some kind of contextual frame.\n\nCommunicative systems presuppose contexts that are structured in terms of particular physical and communicative dimensions, for instance time, location, and communicative role.\n\n"}

When the family had a meal, they threw a bit into the fire on the hearth for the Penates. They were thus associated with Vesta, the Lares, and the Genius of the \"paterfamilias\" in the \"little universe\" of the \"domus\".\n\nLike other domestic deities, the Penates had a public counterpart.\n\nAn etymological interpretation of the Penates would make them in origin tutelary deities of the storeroom, Latin \"penus\", the innermost part of the house, where they guarded the household's food, wine, oil, and other supplies. As they were originally associated with the source of food, they eventually became a symbol of the continuing life of the family. Cicero explained that they \"dwell inside, from which they are also called \"penetrales\" by the poets\". The 2nd-century AD grammarian Festus defined \"penus\", however, as \"the most secret site in the shrine of Vesta, which is surrounded by curtains.\" Macrobius reports the theological view of Varro that \"those who dig out truth more diligently have said that the Penates are those through whom we breathe in our inner core \"(penitus)\", through whom we have a body, through whom we possess a rational mind.\"\n\nThe Penates of Rome (\"Penates Publici Populi Romani\") had a temple on the Velia near the Palatine. Dionysius of Halicarnassus says it housed statues of two youths in the archaic style.\n\nThe public cult of the ancestral gods of the Roman people originated in Lavinium, where they were also closely linked with Vesta. One tradition identified the public Penates as the sacred objects rescued by Aeneas from Troy and carried by him to Italy. They, or perhaps rival duplicates, were eventually housed in the Temple of Vesta in the Forum. Thus the Penates, unlike the localized Lares, are portable deities.\n\nArchaeological evidence from Lavinium shows marked Greek influence in the archaic period, and Aeneas was venerated there as Father Indiges. At the new year, Roman magistrates first sacrificed to Capitoline Jupiter at Rome, and then traveled to Lavinium for sacrifices to Jupiter Indiges and Vesta, and a ceremonial visit to the \"Trojan\" Penates.\n"}
{"id": "6759688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6759688", "title": "Duff Beer", "text": "Duff Beer\n\nDuff Beer is a brand of beer that originated as a fictional beverage on the animated series \"The Simpsons\". Beers using the Duff branding have been brewed in a number of countries, resulting in legal battles with varying results. An official version of the beer is sold in three variations near the Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios. In 2015, 21st Century Fox, producer of \"The Simpsons\", began selling licensed Duff beer in Chile, with a view to driving out brandjacking.\n\nIn 2016, \"Time\" included Duff Beer in a list of the most influential fictional companies of all time.\n\nDuff is Homer Simpson's beer of choice. It is a parody of stereotypical mass-market American lager: cheap, poor-quality, and heavily marketed.\n\nThe beer's slogan is \"Can't Get Enough of That Wonderful Duff\", though there are others. In \"Duffless\", parking lot signs at the Duff brewery have the slogans \"It's Always Time For Duff\" and \"Now Leaving Duff Country\". In \"Homer's Odyssey\", Duff is described as \"The beer that makes the days fly by\".\n\nTheir spokesperson is Duffman, a parody of Budweiser's '70s-era mascot Bud Man. He is a muscular, bleach-blond, well-tanned man with whitened teeth who wears a blue leotard and cape, red Duff Beer ballcap, mirror sunglasses, and a utility belt full of cans of Duff Beer. He speaks in a loud and overly-enthusiastic staccato voice (like a radio DJ or beer commercial pitchman) and does a lot of exaggerated physical movements like a male exotic dancer - like dancing in place, groin-thrusting, hip shaking, and rubbing his buttocks with a towel. There are apparently many identical Duffmen; however, like mall Santas they never appear at the same place at the same time (to not disillusion the kids). One retired Duffman in Alcoholics Anonymous referred to himself as \"Barry Duffman\", indicating that he had to assume the identity of Duffman as part of the job. Some of the actors who play him have actually died (presumably from alcohol-related causes); their demise was never acknowledged because the character of Duffman is unaging and immortal. At public appearances he is often flanked by a random pair of beautiful, scantily-clad women who act as arm-candy, backup dancers, and assistants.\n\nWhile Duff Beer comes in several varieties, it is revealed on a Duff Brewery tour in \"Duffless\" that regular Duff, Duff Light, and Duff Dry are the same beer, although Homer and Barney apparently remain oblivious to the fact. A tasting room contains Duff Dark beer and Duff Gummy Beers candy; it also contains several varieties that Barney stated they had not tried yet: Raspberry Duff, Lady Duff and Tartar Control Duff.\n\nIn \"A Tree Grows in Springfield\", Homer asks for Moe's best beer, so Moe gives him a Duff Adequate. In \"The Great Louse Detective\", Duffman claims that Duff Stout is \"the beer that made Ireland famous\".\n\nIn \"Homer the Moe\", Moe sells \"Malaysian Duff\", which is made with soy sauce at his trendy bar. In \"The Springfield Files\", Homer is craving something different than the usual Duff. So Moe gives Homer a bottle of \"Düff\" (Swedish Duff) - it's just a can of regular Duff with the accent mark drawn on in marker pen.\n\nIn \"The War of Art\", Homer offers Kirk Van Houten a bottle of Canadian Duff (or \"Le Duff avec Codeine\" on the label in French), which is laced with Cough Medicine. The label on the bottle's neck has a picture of Canadian Duffman wearing a Mountie uniform and saying his catch phrase in both English (\"Oh Yeah!\") and French (\"Mais Oui!\").\n\nIn \"Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk\", Homer celebrates a recent minor stock windfall by ordering a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve, which is implied to be more costly and of better quality, and which is an apparent spoof of Henry Weinhard's Private Reserve. \n\nIn the season 21 episode \"To Surveil With Love\", Duffman makes a giveaway of Duff advertising in Moe's bar while \"Get Ready For This\" by 2 Unlimited plays on the background, suggesting this might be the theme song for the beer brand or for the character.\n\nFudd, a competitor to Duff, appears in the episodes \"Colonel Homer\" and \"Lemon of Troy\", the latter showing it being enjoyed by residents of Shelbyville, rival town to the Simpsons' home of Springfield. Consumption of Fudd however is alleged by bartender Moe Szyslak to have made hillbillies go blind.\n\nIn the episode entitled \"Selma's Choice\", Bart and Lisa Simpson travel with their aunt Selma to Duff Gardens, a parody of the Busch Gardens amusement park, but also containing elements of Disneyland. In the gift shop, Bart spots \"beer goggles\", spectacles that mimic what drunks see: they make Aunt Selma appear young, feminine, and beautiful to Bart - and also, somehow, alter her voice. Later, they see the mascots of Duff Beer, the Seven Duffs.\n\nIn the same episode, there is also a direct parody of the \"It's a Small World\" attraction at Disney parks. In the cartoon, the boats float on a brown liquid as animatronic children sing \"Duff beer for me, Duff beer for you, I'll have a Duff, You have one, too,\" over and over again. Lisa drinks the liquid in the ride on a dare from Bart, and she freaks out from its hallucinogenic properties.\n\nOther Duff Gardens attractions include the Beeramid, the Beerquarium (\"Home of the world's happiest fish\"), the Beer Hall of Presidents, the Washing Machine ride, the Whiplash rollercoaster, singing group Hooray for Everything (who sing a politically correct version of Lou Reed's \"Walk on the Wild Side\" and are based on Up with People), and a direct parody of Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade.\n\nThe Seven Duffs are characters at the Duff Gardens theme park. The \"Duffs\" are a reference to Walt Disney's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". The Seven Duffs are named Sleazy, Queasy, Surly, Edgy, Tipsy, Dizzy, and Remorseful.\n\nSome have speculated that the name was inspired by one-syllable beer names in the United States (such as \"Bud\"), and \"The Simpsons\"' writers had found the name humorous. However, longtime Simpsons animator, producer, and director David Silverman has stated that Groening named the beer \"Duff\" simply for the convenient rhyme in the slogan \"Can't Get Enough of that Wonderful Duff\".\n\nIn an excerpt from his autobiography, Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan claimed that the beer was named after him as the writers were fans of the band and he was known for his extreme alcohol consumption and was popularly called \"The King of Beers\". This is a claim \"Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening has called \"absurd\". In response McKagan has stated that he thought it was common knowledge and uncontroversial that he was the origin of the name, and jokingly called assertions to the contrary \"absurd.\"\n\nIn fact, Moe's Tavern is a very close recreation of a tavern that was a block from the University of Oregon when Groening was there, called Duffy's. It even had red and green diamond pane windows inside. The beer of choice was Blitz Weinhard, aka Blitz.\n\nMatt Groening has stated that he will not license the Duff trademark to brew an actual beer, over concern that it would encourage children to drink. However, there have been a few notable cases of individual companies and persons who have used the term \"Duff Beer\" with varying success.\n\nDuff's Famous Wings in Buffalo and Rochester, New York sells their own form of Duff's beer on tap.\n\nBilbo's pizza and brewery in Kalamazoo, Michigan also brewed their own form of Duff beer, which had a Homer Simpson tap handle to complete the reference.\n\nOn June 1, 2013, Universal Studios Florida began offering Duff Beer in their expanded Springfield area at a replica of Moe's Tavern and a waterfront Duff Brewery.\n\nIn Germany the Eschweger Klosterbrauerei, a brewery in Hessen, brewed a Duff Beer under the German Reinheitsgebot, under contract for Duff Beer UG. It was distributed in many European countries, and in Australia from 2011.\n\nDuff Beer UG applied for an EU Community Trade Mark (CTM) in 2009, which was opposed by Twentieth Century Fox. In 2011 the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market decided in favour of Fox, and in 2012 Duff Beer UG appealed to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).\n\nTwentieth Century Fox had itself been granted a CTM for the logo \"Duff BEER\" for use in several categories of non-beer merchandise. Fox had applied for the CTM in 1999, but opposition from the makers of \"Mac Duff's\"-branded wine and spirits delayed the grant till 2006. Fox's CTM was cancelled by the OHIM in 2011, following a 2010 ruling by the Brussels Commercial Court that a \"Beer\" logo applied exclusively to non-beer merchandise was misleading.\n\nIn 2014, Duff Beer UG's CTM was transferred to Fox, and the ECJ case was withdrawn. There was also a German trademark registered in 1999 to Duff Beverage GmbH, creating what one lawyer in 2015 called a \"very complex situation\".\n\nDaleside Brewery in England makes a beer called Duff.\nDuff Beer UG's beer is distributed in the United Kingdom as \"The Legendary Duff Beer\". While news reports of its 2011 introduction mentioned \"The Simpsons\", its own website does not, although it refers to its \"iconic packaging\" and states \"The product has certainly fulfilled its namesake in becoming a modern day legend\".\n\nIn the mid 1990s, the Lion Nathan brewery in Australia produced a beer called Duff. 20th Century Fox brought legal action against the company. The product was ordered to be pulled from store shelves and destroyed, because of the likely association in public mind between the \"Simpsons\" brand and characters and Lion Nathan's product, though the manufacturer did not use any \"Simpsons\" characters or the \"Simpsons\" Duff Beer design. The beer became a collectors' item in the process, with one case selling for US$13,000.\n\nDuff Beer UG's beer was introduced in Australia in 2011.\n\nOn September 8, 2014 another incarnation of Duff which had only been launched in May 2014 for sale through the Woolworths chain was pulled from Australian shelves due to a complaint to Alcohol Beverages Advertising Code adjudication panel.\n\nThe Investigations Police of Chile seized 60,000 bottles of Duff-brand beer in the city of Linares following an intellectual property complaint from 20th Century Fox in March 2013.\n\nPartially due to unauthorized Duff beer in the country, Fox announced plans to sell official Duff beer in Chile starting in early 2016, with plans to expand elsewhere in South America and into Europe. Producing a real Duff beer will allow Fox stronger trademark protections of the Duff name; as a fictional product, it is more susceptible to piracy.\n\nSince 2006, Rodrigo Contreras, from Guadalajara, Mexico is setting up a business with the purpose of selling Duff beer. He managed to register the \"Duff\" trademark in Mexico, as well as the domain name DuffDeMexico.com. Contreras designed the bottle to be identical to the one portrayed on \"The Simpsons\". The bottle can be seen at his website. The beer is currently available at a few bars, but Contreras has stated his intention of selling it at convenience stores and even exporting it to the United States.\n\nThis case has been featured on several Mexican newspapers and magazines, but most of them focus on the novelty the beer represents, rather than the legal implications of it. The \"Duff\" trademark was not registered in Mexico before Contreras registered it; however, Mexican intellectual property law recognizes the concept of \"brand notoriety\", which states that if any brand is well known by a specific section of the consumers or the industry due to the commercial activities or advertisement done by its owners, they have the right to claim the ownership of the trademark.\n\nSince its inception, the Mexican brand Duff has spread to other countries in Latin-America like Brazil, Chile, Colombia, among others. In some countries, the legal implications and intellectual property is being questioned by Fox representatives, but no court decision has been met yet.\n\nDuff Beer UG's beer was introduced into France in 2011, though with limited success. Since French television has a strict prohibition on advertising and product placement of alcohol, subsequent broadcasts of \"The Simpsons\" have blurred the Duff logo on screen. The name is not censored on the soundtrack, but Duffman was redubbed \"Uffman\".\n\nDuff Brewery in Dunedin, New Zealand brewed Duff Beer many years before \"The Simpsons\", but due to threatened legal action by Fox they negotiated at name to McDuff.\n\nThe gift shop of The Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios sells a canned energy drink made by Boston America Corp. that is designed to look like a Duff Beer can. It is also sold at a limited number of other locations, including Five Below, 2nd & Charles, and in the UK at American import stores such as Cybercandy, and Bootleggers.\n"}

{"id": "21456217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21456217", "title": "Ethics and religious culture", "text": "Ethics and religious culture\n\nEthics and religious culture (Éthique et culture religieuse) is a course taught in all elementary and high schools in Quebec. It replaces the abolished subject of religious/moral education in these schools and is compulsory in all schools: private as well as public. The aim of the subject is to develop ethical thinking and dialog skills in response to the changing religious/ non religious diversity of cultural communities in the Province. It also allows for all students to understand Quebec's religious history. ( MELS ERC Curriculum LEARN QUEBEC) The program's twin paramount principles are Recognition of Others and Pursuit of the Common Good. It is also claimed that the course will promote a \"culture of dialogue\" among students.\n\nThe project was adopted under the liberal government of Jean Charest, and has garnered some controversy. The first year this course has been taught is 2008-2009.\n\nThe course has been opposed by three main groups:\n\n\nMany condemned the fact that the State is imposing a vision of morals and religion (or lack thereof), which has traditionally been the purview of parents.\n\nTwo legal challenges were launched against the compulsory nature of this course.\n\nA court case against the ERC curriculum was heard from the 11th to the 15th of May, 2009 in Quebec’s Superior Court in Drummondville. Two Catholic parents were challenging the school’s refusal of an exemption for both their first grader and their sixteen-year-old who was in last year of high school. They were arguing that the course’s contents put their children’s faith at risk by being premature, relativistic and polytheistic, and teaching ethics detached from the parents' moral framework. It was seen as a test case for Quebec parents.\n\nThe parents lost their court case and decided to bring their cause to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted the parents leave to appeal, but on hearing the merits determined that the appellants were unable to prove their case.\n\nThe case was heard on the 18th of May 2011 by the highest tribunal in Canada. A summary of the legal issues at stake is listed on the Supreme Court's site. The parents' factum is to be found here.\nApart from the original parties, 8 additional parties were granted the status of interveners (a pointer is supplied to the party's factum):\nThe Evangelical Fellowship of Canada wrote a FAQ in layman's terms explaining what it saw as the issues at stake and how this court case differs from the Loyola one.\nTwo court reports were published, one in English by a writer of the Catholic register, another more detailed in French by a parent in favour of parents being exempt of this course if they so wish.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard the case and ruled that \"...[the court] cannot conclude that the appellants have been able to prove their case.\" \n\nThe parents were awarded the Catholics Civil Right League's yearly award for their defense of parents' free choice in education.\n\nA private Catholic high school, Loyola High School in Montreal, also launched a court challenge. Loyola High was challenging the fact that the Ministry of Education has not allowed it to teach what it deems an equivalent ethics and religion course better fitting the Catholic outlook of the school. It alleged that the Ministry had done so despite provisions in the law that would allow such an equivalent course.\n\nLoyola High won its court case and is now exempt for the ERC course and may teach its equivalent Catholic course. On the 18th of June 2010, Superior Court Justice Gerard Dugre compared the attempt of the education minister to impose a secular emphasis on Loyola High School's teaching of the course to the intolerance of the Spanish Inquisition: \"The obligation imposed on Loyola to teach the ethics and religious culture course in a lay fashion assumes a totalitarian character essentially equivalent to Galileo's being ordered by the Inquisition to deny the Copernican universe,\" the judge wrote in his 63-page decision.\n\nSeveral polls had shown the Quebec population to be polarized around this course. While 45% opposed the course in October 2008, 72% wanted parents to be able to choose the moral and religious training their children will get at school: the new ERC course or a traditional denominational religion course. In May 2009, the proportion of Quebecers wanting this choice had risen to 76%.\n\nOn May 28, 2009, the Canadian Jewish News announced the formation of a grassroots organization to represent \"a response of Orthodox Judaism to the Ethics and Religious Culture program.\" The organization, calling itself the Council on Jewish Education in Quebec, commended the Quebec government for championing the cause of universal friendship among human beings, and for identifying \"Recognition of Others\" and \"Pursuit of the Common Good\" as values to be taught. However, the organization contended that because Orthodox Jews are required according to Torah law to limit their study of theology to the theology of the Torah, the curriculum should consist of the Noahide Code. The \"Hade'ah Vihaddibur\" online Orthodox Jewish weekly newspaper reported a comparable sentiment expressed by the Israeli halakhic decisor Yosef Shalom Eliashiv. Consistent with this response, the Montreal Gazette, in an op/ed published on June 6, 2009 (p. B6), noted that Quebec Jewish school curricula are exclusively loyal to the theology of the Torah.\n\n"}

His name is derived from the Middle High German \"grob\" or \"grop\", meaning coarse or vulgar. The Old High German cognate is \"gerob\", \"gerop\".\n\nThe word \"grobian\" has thus passed into the English language as an obscure word for any crude, sloppy, or buffoonish person.\n\nThe satirist Sebastian Brant (1457-1521) conceived Saint Grobian as the patron saint of coarse manners in his famous poem \"Das Narrenschiff\" (1494). \"Das Narrenschiff\" describes the worship paid to this new saint.\n\nGrobian is found later in several works of the period.\n\nFriedrich Dedekind (1524-1598) published \"Grobianus et Grobiana: sive, de morum simplicitate, libri tres\" in 1558 at Cologne. Here Grobian is a counselor who teaches men on how to avoid bad manners, gluttony, and drunkenness.\n\nDedekind's work appeared in England in 1605 as \"The Schoole of Slovenrie: Or, Cato turnd wrong side outward\", published by one \"R.F.\". The \"Schoole\" was imagined as a place where one was instructed to use one's greasy fingers to grab at the nicest portions of any dish and snatch food belonging to fellow diners. Holding back the desire to urinate, fart, and vomit is taught to be bad for one's health; thus, one has to indulge freely in all three activities.\n\nThe work also inspired Thomas Dekker's \"The Guls Horne-Booke\" (1609).\n\nThe German writer Melchior Meyr was the author of a work entitled \"Gespräche mit einem Grobian\" (1866).\n\nSebastian Brant's allegory was translated into English by Alexander Barclay and Henry Watson as \"Ship of Fools\", both in 1509.

The sole species, Hylotrupes bajulus, is known by several common names, including house longhorn beetle, old house borer, and European house borer. Originating in Europe, and having been spread in timber and wood products, the beetle now has a practically cosmopolitan distribution, including Southern Africa, Asia, the Americas, Australia, and much of Europe and the Mediterranean.\n\n\"Hylotrupes bajulus\" preferentially attacks freshly produced sapwood of softwood timber, in Australia particularly pine, so, contrary to the name \"old-house borer\", the species is more often found in new houses; maybe because the beetles are attracted to the higher resin content of wood harvested more recently than 10 years earlier. If old wood is attacked, the damage is usually greater. As the nutrient content of wood decreases with age the larva has to consume larger amounts of wood. In Australia the infection of home construction is mainly caused by the use of wood already infected with the eggs or larvae of the beetles if the wood is not properly kiln-dried in production.\n\nThe life cycle from egg to egg typically takes two to ten years, depending on the type of wood, its age and quality, its moisture content, and also depending on environmental conditions such as temperature. Only the larvae feed on the wood. Larvae usually pupate just beneath the wood surface and eclose in mid to late summer. Once the exoskeleton of the newly emerged adult beetle has hardened sufficiently the adults cut oval exit holes 6–10 mm (¼ to 3/8 in) in diameter, typically leaving coarse, powdery frass in the vicinity of the hole. Adults are most active in the summer. They are brown to black, appearing grey because of a fine grey furriness on most of the upper surface. On the pronotum two conspicuously hairless tubercles are characteristic of the species.\n"}
{"id": "23270459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23270459", "title": "Inception", "text": "Inception\n\nInception is a 2010 science fiction action film written, co-produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan, and co-produced by Emma Thomas. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious, and is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious. The ensemble cast additionally includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\n\nAfter the 2002 completion of \"Insomnia\", Nolan presented to Warner Bros. a written 80-page treatment about a horror film envisioning \"dream stealers\" based on lucid dreaming. Deciding he needed more experience before tackling a production of this magnitude and complexity, Nolan retired the project and instead worked on 2005's \"Batman Begins\", 2006's \"The Prestige\", and \"The Dark Knight\" in 2008. The treatment was revised over 6 months and was purchased by Warner in February 2009. \"Inception\" was filmed in six countries, beginning in Tokyo on June 19 and ending in Canada on November 22. Its official budget was $160 million, split between Warner Bros and Legendary. Nolan's reputation and success with \"The Dark Knight\" helped secure the film's $100 million in advertising expenditure.\n\n\"Inception\"s première was held in London on July 8, 2010; it was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters beginning on July 16, 2010. \"Inception\" grossed over $828 million worldwide, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 2010. The home video market also had strong results, with $68 million in DVD and Blu-ray sales. \"Inception\" opened to acclaim from critics, who praised its screenplay, visual effects, score, and ensemble cast. It won four Academy Awards for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for four more: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Original Score.\n\nDominick \"Dom\" Cobb and Arthur are \"extractors\", who perform corporate espionage using an experimental military technology to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Their latest target, Japanese businessman Saito, reveals that he arranged their mission himself to test Cobb for a seemingly impossible job: planting an idea in a person's subconscious, or \"inception\". To break up the energy conglomerate of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer, Saito wants Cobb to convince Fischer's son and heir, Robert, to dissolve his father's company. In return, Saito promises to use his influence to clear Cobb of a murder charge, allowing Cobb to return home to his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: Eames, a conman and identity forger; Yusuf, a chemist who concocts a powerful sedative for a stable \"dream within a dream\" strategy; and Ariadne, an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes, recruited with the help of Cobb's father-in-law, Professor Stephen Miles. While dream-sharing with Cobb, Ariadne learns his subconscious houses an invasive projection of his late wife Mal.\n\nWhen the elder Fischer dies in Sydney, Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten-hour flight back to Los Angeles, which the team (including Saito, who wants to verify their success) uses as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream. At each dream level, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a \"kick\" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level; to be successful, these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level, a fact complicated due to the nature of time which flows much faster in each successive level. The first level is Yusuf's dream of a rainy Los Angeles. The team abducts Fischer, but they are attacked by armed projections from Fischer's subconscious, which has been specifically trained to defend him against such intruders. The team takes Fischer and a wounded Saito to a warehouse, where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up, the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into \"limbo\", a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is extremely difficult, if not impossible, and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream. Despite these setbacks, the team continues with the mission.\n\nEames impersonates Fischer's godfather, Peter Browning, to suggest Fischer reconsider his father's will. Yusuf drives the van as the other dreamers are sedated into the second level. In the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur, Cobb persuades Fischer that he has been kidnapped by Browning and Cobb is his subconscious protector. Cobb persuades him to go down another level to explore Browning's subconscious (in reality, it is a ruse to enter Fischer's). The third level is a fortified hospital on a snowy mountain dreamed by Eames. The team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as Cobb takes Fischer into the equivalent of his subconscious. Yusuf, under pursuit by Fischer's projections in the first level, deliberately drives off a bridge and initiates his kick too soon. This causes an avalanche in Eames' level and removes the gravity of Arthur's level, forcing him to improvise a new kick synchronized with the van hitting the water. Mal's projection emerges and kills Fischer; Cobb kills Mal, and Saito succumbs to his wounds. Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to rescue Fischer and Saito, while Eames sets up a kick by rigging the hotel with explosives.\n\nCobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to Limbo while experimenting with the dream-sharing technology. Sedated for a few hours of real time, they spent fifty years in a dream constructing a world from their shared memories. When Mal refused to return to reality, Cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem (an object dreamers use to distinguish dreams from reality) and reminding her subconscious that their world was not real. However, when she woke up, Mal still believed that she was dreaming. In an attempt to \"wake up\" for real, Mal committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in the care of Professor Miles.\n\nThrough his confession, Cobb makes peace with his guilt over Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's projection and wakes Fischer up with a kick. Revived at the mountain fort, Fischer enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man. While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awake on the plane and Saito makes a phone call.\n\nUpon arrival at Los Angeles Airport, Cobb passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and Professor Miles accompanies him to his home. Using his totem—a spinning top that spins indefinitely in a dream world but falls over in reality—Cobb conducts a test to prove that he is indeed in the real world, but he ignores its result and instead joins his children in the garden.\n\n\nInitially, Nolan wrote an 80-page treatment about dream-stealers. Originally, Nolan had envisioned \"Inception\" as a horror film, but eventually wrote it as a heist film even though he found that \"traditionally [they] are very deliberately superficial in emotional terms.\" Upon revisiting his script, he decided that basing it in that genre did not work because the story \"relies so heavily on the idea of the interior state, the idea of dream and memory. I realized I needed to raise the emotional stakes.\" Nolan worked on the script for nine to ten years. When he first started thinking about making the film, Nolan was influenced by \"that era of movies where you had \"The Matrix\" (1999), you had \"Dark City\" (1998), you had \"The Thirteenth Floor\" (1999) and, to a certain extent, you had \"Memento\" (2000), too. They were based in the principles that the world around you might not be real.\"\n\nNolan first pitched the film to Warner Bros. in 2001, but then felt that he needed more experience making large-scale films, and embarked on \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Dark Knight\". He soon realized that a film like \"Inception\" needed a large budget because \"as soon as you're talking about dreams, the potential of the human mind is infinite. And so the scale of the film has to feel infinite. It has to feel like you could go anywhere by the end of the film. And it has to work on a massive scale.\" After making \"The Dark Knight\", Nolan decided to make \"Inception\" and spent six months completing the script. Nolan states that the key to completing the script was wondering what would happen if several people shared the same dream. \"Once you remove the privacy, you've created an infinite number of alternative universes in which people can meaningfully interact, with validity, with weight, with dramatic consequences.\"\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio was the first actor to be cast in the film. Nolan had been trying to work with the actor for years and met him several times, but was unable to convince him to appear in any of his films until \"Inception\". DiCaprio finally agreed because he was \"intrigued by this concept—this dream-heist notion and how this character's going to unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life.\" He read the script and found it to be \"very well written, comprehensive but you really had to have Chris in person, to try to articulate some of the things that have been swirling around his head for the last eight years.\" DiCaprio and Nolan spent months talking about the screenplay. Nolan took a long time re-writing the script in order \"to make sure that the emotional journey of his character was the driving force of the movie.\" On February 11, 2009, it was announced that Warner Bros. purchased \"Inception\", a spec script written by Nolan.\n\nPrincipal photography began in Tokyo on June 19, 2009, with the scene where Saito first hires Cobb during a helicopter flight over the city.\nThe production moved to the United Kingdom and shot in a converted airship hangar in Cardington, Bedfordshire, north of London. There, the hotel bar set which tilted 30 degrees was built. A hotel corridor was also constructed by Guy Hendrix Dyas, the production designer, Chris Corbould, the special effects supervisor, and Wally Pfister, the director of photography; it rotated a full 360 degrees to create the effect of alternate directions of gravity for scenes set during the second level of dreaming, where dream-sector physics become chaotic. The idea was inspired by a technique used in Stanley Kubrick's \"\" (1968). Nolan said, \"I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario\". The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40 ft (12 m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway's length grew to 100 ft (30 m). The corridor was suspended along eight large concentric rings that were spaced equidistantly outside its walls and powered by two massive electric motors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Arthur, spent several weeks learning to fight in a corridor that spun like \"a giant hamster wheel\". Nolan said of the device, \"It was like some incredible torture device; we thrashed Joseph for weeks, but in the end we looked at the footage, and it looks unlike anything any of us has seen before. The rhythm of it is unique, and when you watch it, even if you know how it was done, it confuses your perceptions. It's unsettling in a wonderful way\". Gordon-Levitt remembered, \"it was six-day weeks of just, like, coming home at night battered ... The light fixtures on the ceiling are coming around on the floor, and you have to choose the right time to cross through them, and if you don't, you're going to fall.\" On July 15, 2009, filming took place at University College London for the sequences occurring inside a Paris college of architecture in the story, including the library, Flaxman Gallery and Gustav Tuck Theatre.\n\nFilming moved to France where they shot Cobb entering the college of architecture (the place used for the entrance was the Musée Galliera) and the pivotal scenes between Ariadne and Cobb, in a bistro (a fictional one set up at the corner of Rue César Franck and Rue Bouchut) and then on the Bir-Hakeim bridge. For the explosion that takes place during the bistro scene, the local authorities would not allow the actual use of explosives. High-pressure nitrogen was used to create the effect of a series of explosions. Pfister used six high-speed cameras to capture the sequence from different angles and make sure that they got the shot. The visual effects department then enhanced the sequence, adding more destruction and flying debris. For the \"Paris folding\" sequence and when Ariadne \"creates\" the bridges, green screen and CGI were used on location.\n\nTangier, Morocco, doubled as Mombasa, where Cobb hires Eames and Yusuf. A foot chase was shot in the streets and alleyways of the historic medina quarter. To capture this sequence, Pfister employed a mix of hand-held camera and steadicam work. Tangier was also used to film an important riot scene during the initial foray into Saito's mind.\n\nFilming moved to the Los Angeles area, where some sets were built on a Warner Bros. sound stage, including the interior rooms of Saito's Japanese castle (the exterior was done on a small set built in Malibu beach). The dining room was inspired by the Nijo Castle built around 1603. These sets were inspired by a mix of Japanese architecture and Western influences. The production also staged a multi-vehicle car chase on the streets of downtown Los Angeles, which involved a freight train crashing down the middle of a street. To do this, the filmmakers configured a train engine on the chassis of a tractor trailer. The replica was made from fiberglass molds taken from authentic train parts and then matched in terms of color and design. Also, the car chase was supposed to be set in the midst of a downpour but the L.A. weather stayed typically sunny. The filmmakers were forced to set up elaborate effects (e.g., rooftop water cannons) to give the audience the impression that the weather was overcast and soggy. L.A. was also the site of the climactic scene where a Ford Econoline van flies off the Schuyler Heim Bridge in slow motion. This sequence was filmed on and off for months with the van being shot out of a cannon, according to actor Dileep Rao. Capturing the actors suspended within the van in slow motion took a whole day to film. Once the van landed in the water, the challenge for the actors was not to panic. \"And when they ask you to act, it's a bit of an ask,\" explained Cillian Murphy. The actors had to be underwater for four to five minutes while drawing air from scuba tanks; underwater buddy breathing is shown in this sequence. Cobb's house was in Pasadena. The hotel lobby was filmed at the CAA building in Century City. Limbo was made on location in Los Angeles and Morocco with the beach scene filmed at Palos Verdes beach with CGI buildings. N Hope St. in Los Angeles was the primary filming location for Limbo, with green screen and CGI being used to create the dream landscape.\n\nThe final phase of principal photography took place in Alberta in late November 2009. The location manager discovered a temporarily closed ski resort, Fortress Mountain. An elaborate set was assembled near the top station of the Canadian chairlift, taking three months to build. The production had to wait for a huge snowstorm, which eventually arrived. The ski-chase sequence was inspired by Nolan's favorite James Bond film, \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" (1969): \"What I liked about it that we've tried to emulate in this film is there's a tremendous balance in that movie of action and scale and romanticism and tragedy and emotion.\"\n\nThe film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format on 35 mm film, with key sequences filmed on 65 mm, and aerial sequences in VistaVision. Nolan did not shoot any footage with IMAX cameras as he had with \"The Dark Knight\". \"We didn't feel that we were going to be able to shoot in IMAX because of the size of the cameras because this film given that it deals with a potentially surreal area, the nature of dreams and so forth, I wanted it to be as realistic as possible. Not be bound by the scale of those IMAX cameras, even though I love the format dearly\". In addition Nolan and Pfister tested using Showscan and Super Dimension 70 as potential large format high frame rate camera systems to use for the film, but ultimately decided against either format. Sequences in slow motion were filmed on a Photo-Sonics 35mm camera at speeds of up to 1000 frames per second. Wally Pfister tested shooting some of these sequences using a high speed digital camera, but found the format to be too unreliable due to technical glitches. \"Out of six times that we shot on the digital format, we only had one useable piece and it didn't end up in the film. Out of the six times we shot with the Photo-Sonics camera and 35mm running through it, every single shot was in the movie.\" Nolan also chose not to shoot any of the film in 3D as he prefers shooting on film using prime lenses, which is not possible with 3D cameras. Nolan has also criticized the dim image that 3D projection produces, and disputes that traditional film does not allow realistic depth perception, saying \"I think it's a misnomer to call it 3D versus 2D. The whole point of cinematic imagery is it's three dimensional... You know 95% of our depth cues come from occlusion, resolution, color and so forth, so the idea of calling a 2D movie a '2D movie' is a little misleading.\" Nolan did test converting \"Inception\" into 3D in post-production but decided that, while it was possible, he lacked the time to complete the conversion to a standard he was happy with. In February 2011 Jonathan Liebesman suggested that Warner Bros were attempting a 3D conversion for Blu-ray release.\n\nWally Pfister gave each location and dream level a distinctive look to aid the audience's recognition of the narrative's location during the heavily crosscut portion of the film: the mountain fortress appears sterile and cool, the hotel hallways have warm hues, and the scenes in the van are more neutral.\n\nNolan has said that the film \"deals with levels of reality, and perceptions of reality which is something I'm very interested in. It's an action film set in a contemporary world, but with a slight science-fiction bent to it,\" while also describing it as \"very much an ensemble film structured somewhat as a heist movie. It's an action adventure that spans the globe\".\n\nFor dream sequences in \"Inception\", Nolan used little computer-generated imagery, preferring practical effects whenever possible. Nolan said, \"It's always very important to me to do as much as possible in-camera, and then, if necessary, computer graphics are very useful to build on or enhance what you have achieved physically.\" To this end, visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin built a miniature of the mountain fortress set and then blew it up for the film. For the fight scene that takes place in zero gravity, he used CG-based effects to \"subtly bend elements like physics, space and time.\"\n\nThe most challenging effect was the \"limbo\" city level at the end of the film because it continually developed during production. Franklin had artists build concepts while Nolan gave his ideal vision: \"Something glacial, with clear modernist architecture, but with chunks of it breaking off into the sea like icebergs\". Franklin and his team ended up with \"something that looked like an iceberg version of Gotham City with water running through it.\" They created a basic model of a glacier and then designers created a program that added elements like roads, intersections and ravines until they had a complex, yet organic-looking, cityscape. For the Paris-folding sequence, Franklin had artists producing concept sketches and then they created rough computer animations to give them an idea of what the sequence looked like while in motion. Later during principal photography, Nolan was able to direct Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page based on this rough computer animation Franklin had created. \"Inception\" had close to 500 visual effects shots (in comparison, \"Batman Begins\" had approximately 620) which is considered minor in comparison to contemporary visual effects epics that can have around 1,500 or 2,000 special effects images.\n\nThe score for \"Inception\" was written by Hans Zimmer, who described his work as \"a very electronic, dense score\", filled with \"nostalgia and sadness\" to match Cobb's feelings throughout the film. The music was written simultaneously to filming, and features a guitar sound reminiscent of Ennio Morricone, played by Johnny Marr, former guitarist of The Smiths.\nÉdith Piaf's \"Non, je ne regrette rien\" (\"No, I Do Not Regret Anything\") pointedly appears throughout the film, used to accurately time the dreams, and Zimmer reworked pieces of the song into cues of the score.\n\nIn \"Inception\", Nolan wanted to explore \"the idea of people sharing a dream space...That gives you the ability to access somebody's unconscious mind. What would that be used and abused for?\" The majority of the film's plot takes place in these interconnected dream worlds. This structure creates a framework where actions in the real or dream worlds ripple across others. The dream is always in a state of production, and shifts across the levels as the characters navigate it. By contrast, the world of \"The Matrix\" (1999) is an authoritarian, computer-controlled one, alluding to theories of social control developed by thinkers Michel Foucault and Jean Baudrillard. However, according to one interpretation Nolan's world has more in common with the works of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari.\n\nDavid Denby in \"The New Yorker\" compared Nolan's cinematic treatment of dreams to Luis Buñuel's in \"Belle de Jour\" (1967) and \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" (1972). He criticized Nolan's \"literal-minded\" action level sequencing compared to Buñuel, who \"silently pushed us into reveries and left us alone to enjoy our wonderment, but Nolan is working on so many levels of representation at once that he has to lay in pages of dialogue just to explain what's going on.\" The latter captures \"the peculiar malign intensity of actual dreams.\"\n\nDeirdre Barrett, a dream researcher at Harvard University, said that Nolan did not get every detail accurate regarding dreams, but their illogical, rambling, disjointed plots would not make for a great thriller anyway. However, \"he did get many aspects right,\" she said, citing the scene in which a sleeping Cobb is shoved into a full bath, and in the dream world water gushes into the windows of the building, waking him up. \"That's very much how real stimuli get incorporated, and you very often wake up right after that intrusion\".\n\nNolan himself said, \"I tried to work that idea of manipulation and management of a conscious dream being a skill that these people have. Really the script is based on those common, very basic experiences and concepts, and where can those take you? And the only outlandish idea that the film presents, really, is the existence of a technology that allows you to enter and share the same dream as someone else.\"\n\nOthers have argued that the film is itself a metaphor for filmmaking, and that the filmgoing experience itself, images flashing before one's eyes in a darkened room, is akin to a dream. Writing in \"Wired\", Jonah Lehrer supported this interpretation and presented neurological evidence that brain activity is strikingly similar during film-watching and sleeping. In both, the visual cortex is highly active and the prefrontal cortex, which deals with logic, deliberate analysis, and self-awareness, is quiet. Paul argued that the experience of going to a picturehouse is itself an exercise in shared dreaming, particularly when viewing \"Inception\": the film's sharp cutting between scenes forces the viewer to create larger narrative arcs to stitch the pieces together. This demand of production parallel to consumption of the images, on the part of the audience is analogous to dreaming itself. As in the film's story, in a cinema one enters into the space of another's dream, in this case Nolan's, as with any work of art, one's reading of it is ultimately influenced by one's own subjective desires and subconscious. At Bir-Hakeim bridge in Paris, Ariadne creates an illusion of infinity by adding facing mirrors underneath its struts, Stephanie Dreyfus in \"la Croix\" asked \"Is this not a strong, beautiful metaphor for the cinema and its power of illusion?\"\n\nNolan combined elements from several different film genres into the film, notably science fiction, heist film, and film noir.\nMarion Cotillard plays \"Mal\" Cobb, Dom Cobb's projection of his guilt over his deceased wife's suicide. As the film's main antagonist, she is a frequent, malevolent presence in his dreams. Dom is unable to control these projections of her, challenging his abilities as an extractor. Nolan described Mal as \"the essence of the femme fatale\", the key \"noir\" reference in the film. As a \"classic femme fatale\" her relationship with Cobb is in his mind, a manifestation of Cobb's own neurosis and fear of how little he knows about the woman he loves. DiCaprio praised Cotillard's performance saying that \"she can be strong and vulnerable and hopeful and heartbreaking all in the same moment, which was perfect for all the contradictions of her character\".\n\nNolan began with the structure of a heist movie, since exposition is an essential element of that genre, though adapted it to have a greater emotional narrative suited to the world of dreams and subconscious. Or, as Denby surmised, \"the outer shell of the story is an elaborate caper\". Kristin Thompson argued that exposition was a major formal device in the film. While a traditional heist movie has a heavy dose of exposition at the beginning as the team assembles and the leader explains the plan, in \"Inception\" this becomes nearly continuous as the group progresses through the various levels of dreaming. Three-quarters of the film, until the van begins to fall from the bridge, are devoted to explaining its plot. In this way, exposition takes precedence over characterisation. Their relationships are created by their respective skills and roles. Ariadne, like her ancient namesake, creates the maze and guides the others through it, but also helps Cobb navigate his own subconscious, and as the sole student of dream sharing, helps the audience understand the concept of the plot.\n\nNolan drew inspiration from the works of Jorge Luis Borges and \"Blade Runner\" (1982) by Ridley Scott.\n\nThe film cuts to the closing credits from a shot of the top apparently starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, \"I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it.\" The film's script concludes with \"Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT\". Nolan said, \"I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — and this is what I tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing.\" Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, \"If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream.\"\n\nSome pundits have argued that the top was not in fact Cobb's totem, rendering the discussion irrelevant. They say that the top was Mal's totem; Cobb's was his wedding ring, as he can be seen wearing it whenever he is in a dream and without it whenever he isn't. As he hands his passport to the immigration officer, his hand is shown with no ring; thus he was conclusively in reality when seeing his children. Furthermore, the children were portrayed by different actors, indicating they had aged.\n\nMark Fisher argued that \"a century of cultural theory\" cautions against accepting the author's interpretation as anything more than a supplementary text, and this all the more so given the theme of the instability of any one master position in Nolan's films. Therein the manipulator is often the one who ends up manipulated and Cobb's \"not caring\" about whether or not his world is real may be the price of happiness and release.\n\nWarner Bros. spent $100 million marketing the film. Although \"Inception\" was not part of an existing franchise, Sue Kroll, president of Warner's worldwide marketing, said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of \"Christopher Nolan as a brand\". Kroll declared that \"We don't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can't make those elements work, it's a sad day.\" The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy—as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, \"You have this movie which is going to have a pretty big built in fanbase... but you also have a movie that you are trying to keep very secret. Chris [Nolan] really likes people to see his movies in a theater and not see it all beforehand so everything that you do to market that—at least early on—is with an eye to feeding the interest to fans.\"\n\nA viral marketing campaign was employed for the film. After the revelation of the first teaser trailer, in August 2009, the film's official website featured only an animation of Cobb's spinning top. In December, the top toppled over and the website opened the online game \"Mind Crime\", which upon completion revealed \"Inception\"s poster. The rest of the campaign unrolled after WonderCon in April 2010, where Warner gave away promotional T-shirts featuring the PASIV briefcase used to create the dream space, and had a QR code linking to an online manual of the device. \"Mind Crime\" also received a stage 2 with more resources, including a hidden trailer for the movie. More pieces of viral marketing began to surface before \"Inception\"s release, such as a manual filled with bizarre images and text sent to \"Wired\" magazine, and the online publication of posters, ads, phone applications, and strange websites all related to the film. Warner also released an online prequel comic, \"Inception: The Cobol Job\".\n\nThe official trailer released on May 10, 2010 through \"Mind Game\" was extremely well received. It featured an original piece of music, \"Mind Heist\", by recording artist Zack Hemsey, rather than music from the score. The trailer quickly went viral with numerous mashups copying its style, both by amateurs on sites like YouTube and by professionals on sites such as CollegeHumor. On June 7, 2010, a behind-the-scenes featurette on the film was released in HD on Yahoo! Movies.\n\n\"Inception\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 3, 2010, in France, and the week after in the UK and USA (December 7, 2010). Warner Bros. also made available in the United States a limited Blu-ray edition packaged in a metal replica of the PASIV briefcase, which included extras such as a metal replica of the spinning top totem. With a production run of less than 2000, it sold out in one weekend. \"Inception\" was released on 4K Blu-ray and digital copy along with every Christopher Nolan film on December 19, 2017. , the home video releases have sold over 9million units and grossed over .\n\nIn a November 2010 interview, Nolan expressed his intention to develop a video game set in the \"Inception\" world, working with a team of collaborators. He described it as \"a longer-term proposition\", referring to the medium of video games as \"something I've wanted to explore\".\n\n\"Inception\" was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters on July 16, 2010. The film had its world premiere at Leicester Square in London, United Kingdom on July 8, 2010. In the United States and Canada, \"Inception\" was released theatrically in 3,792 conventional theaters and 195 IMAX theaters. The film grossed $21.8 million during its opening day on July 16, 2010, with midnight screenings in 1,500 locations. Overall the film made $62.7 million and debuted at No.1 on its opening weekend. \"Inception\"s opening weekend gross made it the second-highest-grossing debut for a science-fiction film that was not a sequel, remake or adaptation, behind \"Avatar\" $77 million opening weekend gross in 2009. The film held the top spot of the box office rankings in its second and third weekends, with drops of just 32% ($42.7 million) and 36% ($27.5 million) respectively, before dropping to second place in its fourth week, behind \"The Other Guys\".\n\n\"Inception\" grossed US$292 million in the United States and Canada, US$56 million in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta and US$475 million in other countries for a total of $823 million worldwide. Its five highest-grossing markets after the US and Canada (US$292) were China (US$68million), the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta (US$56 million), France and the Maghreb region (US$43 million), Japan (US$40 million) and South Korea (US$38 million). It was the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2010 in North America, and the fourth-highest internationally, behind \"Toy Story 3\", \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1\". The film currently stands as the 44th-highest-grossing of all time. \"Inception\" is the third most lucrative production in Christopher Nolan's career—behind \"The Dark Knight\" and \"The Dark Knight Rises\"— and the second most for Leonardo DiCaprio—behind \"Titanic\".\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 345 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Smart, innovative, and thrilling, \"Inception\" is that rare summer blockbuster that succeeds viscerally as well as intellectually.\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". In polls conducted by CinemaScore during the opening weekend audience members gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" called \"Inception\" a \"wildly ingenious chess game,\" and concluded \"the result is a knockout.\"\nJustin Chang of \"Variety\" praised the film as \"a conceptual tour de force\" and wrote, \"applying a vivid sense of procedural detail to a fiendishly intricate yarn set in the labyrinth of the unconscious mind, the writer-director has devised a heist thriller for surrealists, a Jungian's \"Rififi\", that challenges viewers to sift through multiple layers of (un)reality.\" Jim Vejvoda of IGN rated the film as perfect, deeming it \"a singular accomplishment from a filmmaker who has only gotten better with each film.\" \"Relevant\"s David Roark called it Nolan's \"greatest accomplishment,\" saying, \"Visually, intellectually and emotionally, \"Inception\" is a masterpiece.\"\n\nIn its August 2010 issue, \"Empire Magazine\" give the film a full five stars and wrote, \"it feels like Stanley Kubrick adapting the work of the great sci-fi author William Gibson [...] Nolan delivers another true original: welcome to an undiscovered country.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film a B+ grade and wrote, \"It's a rolling explosion of images as hypnotizing and sharply angled as any in a drawing by M. C. Escher or a state-of-the-biz video game; the backwards splicing of Nolan's own \"Memento\" looks rudimentary by comparison.\" The \"New York Post\"s Lou Lumenick gave the film a four-star rating and wrote, \"DiCaprio, who has never been better as the tortured hero, draws you in with a love story that will appeal even to non-sci-fi fans.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" awarded the film a full four stars and said that \"Inception\" \"is all about process, about fighting our way through enveloping sheets of reality and dream, reality within dreams, dreams without reality. It's a breathtaking juggling act.\" Richard Roeper, also of the \"Sun-Times\", gave \"Inception\" an \"A+\" score and called it \"one of the best movies of the [21st] century.\"\n\nBBC Radio 5 Live's Mark Kermode named \"Inception\" as the best film of 2010, stating that \"\"Inception\" is proof that people are not stupid, that cinema is not trash, and that it is possible for blockbusters and art to be the same thing.\"\n\nMichael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote, \"I found myself wishing \"Inception\" were weirder, further out [...] the film is Nolan's labyrinth all the way, and it's gratifying to experience a summer movie with large visual ambitions and with nothing more or less on its mind than (as Shakespeare said) a dream that hath no bottom.\" \"TIME Magazine\"s Richard Corliss wrote that the film's \"noble intent is to implant one man's vision in the mind of a vast audience [...[ The idea of moviegoing as communal dreaming is a century old. With \"Inception\", viewers have a chance to see that notion get a state-of-the-art update.\" Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" felt that Nolan was able to blend \"the best of traditional and modern filmmaking. If you're searching for smart and nervy popular entertainment, this is what it looks like.\"\n\"USA Today\" Claudia Puig give the film three-and-a-half out of four stars and felt that Nolan \"regards his viewers as possibly smarter than they are—or at least as capable of rising to his inventive level. That's a tall order. But it's refreshing to find a director who makes us stretch, even occasionally struggle, to keep up.\"\n\nNot all reviewers gave the film positive reviews. \"New York Magazine\"s David Edelstein claimed in his review that he \"ha[d] no idea what so many people are raving about. It's as if someone went into their heads while they were sleeping and planted the idea that \"Inception\" is a visionary masterpiece and—hold on ... Whoa! I think I get it. The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype—a metaphor for itself.\" of \"The New York Observer\"s Rex Reed explained that the film's development was \"pretty much what we've come to expect from summer movies in general and Christopher Nolan movies in particular ... [it] doesn't seem like much of an accomplishment to me.\" A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" commented \"there is a lot to see in \"Inception\", there is nothing that counts as genuine vision. Mr. Nolan's idea of the mind is too literal, too logical, and too rule-bound to allow the full measure of madness.\" \"The New Yorker\"s David Denby considered the film to \"not nearly [be] as much fun as Nolan imagined it to be\", concluding that \"\"Inception\" is a stunning-looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies, a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else.\"\n\nWhile some critics have tended to view the film as perfectly straightforward, and even criticize its overarching themes as \"the stuff of torpid platitudes,\" online discussion has been much more positive. Heated debate has centered on the ambiguity of the ending, with many critics like Devin Faraci making the case that the film is self-referential and tongue-in-cheek, both a film about film-making and a dream about dreams. Other critics read \"Inception\" as Christian allegory and focus on the film's use of religious and water symbolism. Yet other critics, such as Kristin Thompson, see less value in the ambiguous ending of the film and more in its structure and novel method of storytelling, highlighting \"Inception\" as a new form of narrative that revels in \"continuous exposition\".\n\nSeveral critics and scholars have noted the film has many striking similarities to the 2006 anime film \"Paprika\" by Satoshi Kon (and Yasutaka Tsutsui's 1993 novel of the same name), including plot similarities, similar scenes, and similar characters, arguing that \"Inception\" was influenced by \"Paprika\". Several sources have also noted plot similarities between the film and the 2002 Uncle Scrooge comic \"The Dream of a Lifetime\" by Don Rosa.\n\nIn April 2014, \"The Daily Telegraph\" placed the title on its top ten list of the most overrated films. \"Telegraph\"s Tim Robey stated, \"It's a criminal failing of the movie that it purports to be about people's dreams being invaded, but demonstrates no instinct at all for what a dream has ever felt like, and no flair for making us feel like we're in one, at any point.\" The film won an informal poll by the \"Los Angeles Times\" as the most overrated movie of 2010.\n\nIn March 2011, the film was voted by BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra listeners as their ninth favorite film of all time. \"Inception\" was voted as the third best sci-fi film of all time in the 2011 list \"\", based on a poll conducted by ABC and \"People\". In 2012, \"Inception\" was ranked the 35th Best Edited Film of All Time by the Motion Picture Editors Guild. In the same year, Total Film named it the most rewatchable movie of all time. In 2014, \"Empire\" ranked \"Inception\" the tenth greatest film ever made on their list of \"The 301 Greatest Movies Of All Time\" as voted by the magazine's readers, while \"Rolling Stone\" magazine named it the second best science fiction film since the turn of the century. \"Inception\" was ranked 84th on \"Hollywood's 100 Favorite Films\", a list compiled by \"The Hollywood Reporter\" in 2014, surveying \"Studio chiefs, Oscar winners and TV royalty\". In 2016, \"Inception\" was voted the 51st best film of the 21st Century by BBC, as picked by 177 film critics from around the world. The film was included in the Visual Effects Society's list of \"The Most Influential Visual Effects Films of All Time\".\n\n\"Inception\" was listed on many critics' top ten lists.\n\n\"Inception\" appeared on over 273 critics' lists of the top ten films of 2010, being picked as No.1 on 55 of those lists. It was the second most mentioned film in both the top ten and No.1 lists only behind \"The Social Network\" and was one of the most critically acclaimed films of 2010, alongside the former, \"Toy Story 3\", \"The King's Speech\", and \"Black Swan\".\n\nThe film won many awards in technical categories, such as Academy Awards for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects, and the British Academy Film Awards for Best Production Design, Best Special Visual Effects and Best Sound. In most of its artistic nominations, such as Film, Director, and Screenplay at the Oscars, BAFTAs and Golden Globes, the film was defeated by \"The Social Network\" and \"The King's Speech\". However, the film did win the two highest honors for a science fiction or fantasy film: the 2011 Bradbury Award for best dramatic production and the 2011 Hugo Award for best dramatic presentation, long form.\n\nNumerous pop and hip hop songs reference the film, including Common's \"Blue Sky\", N.E.R.D's \"Hypnotize U\", XV's \"The Kick\", The Black Eyed Peas' \"Just Can't Get Enough\", Lil Wayne's \"6 Foot 7 Foot\", Jennifer Lopez's, \"On the Floor\", and B.o.B's \"Strange Clouds\", while T.I. had \"Inception\"-based artwork on two of his mixtapes. An instrumental track by Joe Budden is titled \"Inception.\" The animated series \"South Park\" parodies the film in the show's tenth episode of its fourteenth season, titled \"Insheeption\". The film was also an influence for Ariana Grande's video for \"No Tears Left to Cry.\"\n\nThe film inspired the suffix \"-ception\", which can be appended to a noun to indicate a layering, nesting, or recursion of the thing in question.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6534572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6534572", "title": "Indigenous psychology", "text": "Indigenous psychology\n\nIndigenous psychology is defined by Kim and Berry (1993) as \"the scientific study of human behavior or mind that is native, that is not transported from other regions, and that is designed for its people.\" Indigenous psychology generally advocates examining knowledge, skills and beliefs people have about themselves and studying them in their natural contexts. Theories, concepts and methods are developed to correspond with psychological phenomena. Indigenous psychology explicitly advocates for incorporating both the content and the context of research. Indigenous psychology is considered necessary since existing psychological theories are not necessarily universal, and may often represent the psychology and cultural traditions of Europe and North America. \n\"Indigenous psychology seeks to discover how the cultural views, theories, assumptions and classifications coupled with overarching social institutions influence psychological topics in each respective culture (2007). Indigenous psychologies are rooted in the systematic influences of formal, political and educational institutions as well as social factors that have and will continue to change the state of psychology. These psychologies grow out of the basic, political, economic, religious, and social components of each culture (Lawson, Graham and Baker, 2007). Indigenous psychologies usually use two distinct categories of psychological knowledge; scientific and applied knowledge reflected in scientific and professional psychology. Many indigenous countries prioritize these two categories usually based on the application of psychological knowledge to overcome challenges facing their culture, such as strengthening education, employment, health, population control and religious conflict rather than attempting to fund new scientific research with limited resources (2007).\n\nKim, Yang and Hwang (2006) distinguish 10 characteristics of indigenous psychology. \n\nAlthough there is debate within the indigenous psychology movement about whether indigenous psychology represents a more universalistic or a more relativistic approach (Chakkarath, 2012), most of these 10 characteristics are advocated by the majority of those in the indigenous psychology movement.\n\nPolitical and economic instability has greatly hindered the development of psychology as a science in Latin America, South Africa, and Indian-Asian Psychology. This problem is a phenomenon that is present across the majority of non-northwestern indigenous psychologies, creating unstable societies (Lawson, Graham, & Baker, 2007, p. 436).\n\nLack of national capital creates a shortage in influential professional fields like psychology and propagates the science of the leading countries. Nations such as the United States, that flourish economically, affect the poorer and less flourishing countries, and in doing so interject their western ideologies the indigenous nations with whom they trade. (Allwood and Berry 2006, p. 248) note six sources of influence on the development of global indigenous psychologies:\n\n\nEach individual indigenous culture maintains their own emic explanations for, and solutions to, their own psychological and behavioral issues. Western psychology needs to shift over and learn to understand the indigenous cultures in their own setting, as Allwood and Berry state, \"…the science has a dual responsibility: to understand people in their own terms (IP), and to search for general principles of human behavior. The development of an IP is valuable in its own right, but they may also collectively serve as building blocks in creating a more general psychology.\" (Allwood, 2006, p. 265)\n\nIn South Africa, specifically, apartheid was a major downfall for their psychology. This period in time intentionally neglected and isolated the field of psychology. \"…in 1948 the Afrikaner National Party gained power and created the system of apartheid to maintain control over the country’s social, economic, and political system\" (Lawson, Graham, & Baker, 2007, p. 438).\n\nIn the India-Asian psychology, there are three strands of psychology which are defined by Rao (1988) \"…to be general psychology…that has universal relevance and application…country and region-specific psychology…the study of geographically bound persons…and native based weltanschauung psychology…driven by the understanding of geographically bound persons yet…highly theoretical or philosophical component\" (Lawson, Graham, & Baker, 2007, p. 441).\n\nIn order for these different countries to better focus their psychological stand points different programs need to instituted and more persons need to become involved in becoming psychologists. \"The current and future states of… indigenous psychologies, require the sustained growth of their scientific research base at the same pace as their applied professional interventions\" (Lawson, Graham, & Baker, 2007, p. 441).\n\nIndigenous psychologies can be alike when they include two different categories of psychological knowledge, explicitly, scientific and applied knowledge reflected in scientific and professional psychology. Each indigenous psychology prioritizes the two in a distinctive way. Trends do exist between more industrialized nations such as the United States. Challenges arise when trying to achieve a successful applied psychology in a culture. One challenge is finding adequate resources. Another challenge is shaping the practice of psychology to suit the circumstances a new culture. It is important to be able to understand the difference between indigenous psychologies and psychological specialties. Psychological specialties include such topics of study lifespan developmental psychology, health psychology, organizational psychology, and social psychology. Indigenous psychologies are culturally specific, and aim to describe, explain, or predict psychological phenomena from within a given culture's worldview.\n\nIndigenous psychology, as defined by Heelas and Lock (1981), consists of the cultural views, theories, classifications and assumptions coupled with the overarching social institutions that influence psychological topics in each respective culture. (Lawson, Graham, Baker, 2007 p. 435) While indigenous psychologies have existed for a long time, only recently have they been studied in the context of global psychology.\nWhile international psychology influences indigenous psychology, it is within each indigenous psychology that the unique histories, social mores, needs and practicalities of a certain culture can be addressed. For example, many Indian psychologists with Western training have incorporated their instruction to include aspects of Indian culture that aren’t necessarily relevant to Western psychology. They have learned to place more emphasis on extended family and community which is more suited to the societal norms of Indian culture than Western culture. (Lawson, Graham, Baker, 2007 p. 440)\nWestern European and American psychologies have historically had the resources to advance psychology both in the applied fields and scientifically. This has not been the case for many indigenous psychologies. For example, in India, where the population is well over one billion, as of 2005 there were only seventy universities teaching psychology. The lack of trained professionals and the demands of an impoverished population have left psychologists in India struggling to meet the needs of its citizens. This has often taken priority over scientific advancement.\n\nIndigenous psychology is useful for studying the impact of political, economic, religious, and social aspects on a specific society. South Africa for example, has been in political and racial turmoil for decades if not centuries, enduring violence and apartheid. Development of indigenous psychology as a focus can limit influence of western concepts and encourage cultivation of socially appropriate methods for the area. According to Lawson, Graham, and Baker (2007), South African psychology should address specific issues related to apartheid such as violence, poverty, racism, and HIV/AIDS to overcome social unrest. Other issues that should also be addressed include addressing the lingering individual trauma associated with apartheid and using a more inclusionary theory versus the exclusionary policies of past psychologies (p. 439).\nIt is important to understand the importance of globalization when exploring indigenous psychologies. In article from the Monitor (May 2006), the APA Senior Director of International Affairs, Merry Bullock discusses globalization of psychology. The article defines globalization as the movement of people and knowledge across borders in the attempt to establish common goals and to develop a homogenized world view of psychology (p. 9). According to Lawson, Graham, and Baker (2007); \"The challenge facing global psychology is trying to find a way to integrate psychology with culture for a more complete understanding of the Human affective, behavioral and cognitive systems\" (p. 434).\n\nGlobalization is also linked to indigenous psychology. In the globalization of psychology there is the hope that Western psychological ideals can be integrated with indigenous psychologies in order to address specific needs of particular countries and/or cultures. Bullock of the APA addresses the opportunities of incorporating Western psychological ideals with ingenious psychologies when she writes: \n\"Globalization offers a tremendous opportunity for psychology to enrich its content, methods and scope. Like all opportunities, however, this must be nurtured, and it must be addressed by open discussion about how to do it. Although we might all agree that it is important to keep an inquiring mind, to share and learn as well as to inform and teach, we also know that our cognitive and social systems make this difficult to implement. To do so, we need strategic and open discussion about assumptions and biases, and we need collaborative interaction to seek a common set of psychological principles\" (p. 9).\nThe future of psychology is expanding worldwide contributing to the formation of psychologies tailored to fit each culture around the world yet linked to an evolving global psychology.\" (Lawson, Graham and, Baker p.435) Understanding indigenous psychologies and finding a way to incorporate them into already established psychological knowledge will positively change the field of psychology.\n\nWhile it is important and necessary that we find a way for indigenous psychologies and global psychologies to mix, we must be careful that assimilation or its predecessors not follow as a result of our desire to mix differing cultural ideals. \"Assimilation refers to those processes whereby groups with distinctive identities become culturally and socially fused.\" (Hughes, p. 222) When assimilation occurs it forces the structural context of a society to change often forcing its cultural traditions to undergo a new development. Assimilation occurs most often when a dominant group and less controlling group interact. While it provides a way for better social interaction and communication to happen it is often the cause of one culture losing its traditions and original beliefs.\n\nRelated to indigenous psychology is a field called critical psychology. This branch of psychology investigates how and why psychology focuses on the individual and disregards power differentials, social, and racial impacts on psychopathology. This branch may be applicable specifically in South Africa due to the apartheid. Authors Painter and Terre Blanche (2004) analyze critical psychology and compare it to what they call mainstream psychology. They describe steps being taken to apply social, political, economical, and racial influences to the field in South Africa and a concern for psychology in South Africa mirroring psychology in the UK and US which would be counter-productive. The advocacy of using social influences in South African society by Painter and Terre Blanche supports the effort to apply indigenous psychology in the area. Further application of indigenous psychology or similar methods will contribute to the field of global psychology.\n\nThree things are in common with indigenous societies including a shortage of resources, professional vs. scientific priority of psychology and the challenge of integrating psychology with culture. \nIndigenous psychologies practice applied psychology over research psychology. They often lack financial support and resources for research psychology. They end to focus on the application of psychological knowledge to overcome challenges facing their country such as strengthening education, employment, health, population control, ethnic and religious conflicts rather than allocating limited resources to expand research psychology. With indigenous psychologies they have evolved more as a profession than a science. \nInstability of a country greatly hinders the development of psychology.Indigenous psychologies may be influenced by western psychology but develop it to better fit their culture.\n\nThe concept of \"parallel lives\" is a useful one for understanding more recent Native American experience so as to better understand how Native American indigenous ways of knowing have been impacted by historical events following the arrival of European and other settlers to the North American continent. Ed Edmo, a well-known Native American storyteller, author, and poet, comparing his experience of the deliberate flooding of Celilo Falls near The Dalles, Oregon in order to build a dam with that of his friend Lani Roberts, a European-American, writes: \"our lives were lived in parallel fashion because of the differences in our ethnic heritage,\" and \"we grew up in the same geographical space but lived in radically different worlds\" as a result of the \"profound racism\" that Native people have suffered (Xing, 173-4).\n\nAn excellent resource for better understanding Native American Psychology in terms of pathology stemming in large part from the traumas inflicted on Native American peoples as a result of their contact with European settlers, is Harold Napoleon’s slim but powerful book Yuuyaraq: The Way of the Human Being. Harold Napoleon is a Yup'ik Eskimo who wrote his book to try to make sense of the profound sadness of his people, and to understand how he came to cause the death of his own son as a result of alcohol abuse. In the book, Harold suggests that his people were suffering from a kind of post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of the \"Great Death\" in which his culture and people were nearly wiped out by disease and other traumatic experiences resulting from contact with European settlers. He further suggests that denial, nallunguarluku, literally ‘pretending it didn’t happen,’ has become something of a cultural trait, one manifestation of which is difficulty in talking about painful circumstances…which can lead to alienation, anger, and self-destructive behavior that some people seek to numb with alcohol\" (Napoleon, viii).\n\nNapoleon writes: \"Yuuyaraq (the way of the human being) encompassed the spirit world in which the Yup'ik lived. It outlined the way of living in harmony with this spirit world and with the spirit beings which inhabited this world\" (Napoleon, 5). Despite the traumas inflicted on Native peoples, from the Great Death(s) to the forced migration and relocation of the Trail of Tears and reservation life, this connection to spirit is something which Native Americans have in common with other racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States, such as African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latino/Hispanic Americans which all \"place strong emphasis on the interplay and interdependence of spiritual life and healthy functioning\" (Sue, 226). While in the West, \"incorporating religion in the rational decision-making process or in the conduct of therapy has generally been seen as unscientific and unprofessional,\" such spiritual \"indigenous healing methods are beginning to be seen as having much to offer Western forms of mental health practice (Sue, 225). These contributions are valuable \"not only because multiple belief systems now exist in our society, but also because counseling and psychotherapy have historically neglected the spiritual dimension of human existence (Sue, 228). It is certain that Western psychology has much to learn from pathological as well as positive psychological traits associated with specific indigenous psychological experiences and ways of knowing.\n\nIn the interest of bridging the gap between contemporary forms of therapy and traditional non-Western indigenous healing, Derald Wing Sue and David Sue propose the following 7 guidelines for Western-trained therapists in dealing with clients of non-Western and indigenous cultures:\n\n\nAnother important contributor to Native American indigenous psychology, was Rupert Ross (1992, 2006). Although in Canada, Ross’ efforts remain relevant to many Native American cultures, especially in Alaska. Ross (1992, 2006) who, while working as a Crown Attorney with First Nations went beyond the confines of the current criminal justice system to explore the aboriginal people who were forced to adhere to it.\n\nRoss (1992) found physiological and psychological differences that prevented aboriginal people proper justice. The ethics of non-interference, that anger not be shown, respecting praise and gratitude, the conservation-withdrawal tactic, and the notion that the time must be right were rules that guided traditional time (Ross, 1992, 13-44). Although assimilating to a degree, Ross (1992) suggested that perhaps there were areas of knowledge from them that our nation could learn from (Ross, 1992, p. 75-77). Even the western scientific method of studying cause of effect differed, as the First Nation believed that humans should not give cause, hence should have no effect on their environment (Ross, 1992, p. 75-77). Ross (1992, 2006) wrote two books on the subject, entitled Dancing With a Ghost: Exploring Aboriginal Reality and Returning to the Teaching: Exploring Aboriginal Justice.\n\nThe Latin American Community has been attempting to rectify their current status, even if it has been a challenge for the professionals in the field of Psychology in Latin America. \n\"Fortunately, recent developments in social issues such as population control, economic development, community psychology (Freire, 1970), national psychology (Diaz-Guerrero, 1984) and child development (Recagno 1982). Applied interventions will ultimately be enhanced from these and other lines of research, providing a more systematic method for addressing the affective, behavioral and cognitive psychological systems of member of a particular culture.\" (Baker, Graham, Lawson and Robert 2007) In the areas that are often looked upon as being problematic for individuals and the Latin American societies, there has been progress in research. It does help some, for American psychologists to continue these studies in America as well. The demographics may be different, however many cultural aspects continue to affect the Latin American population in America today. Those issues are in need of elaboration.\nLatin America has come a long way when it comes to indigenous psychologies because they basically had to jump through loopholes when they faced democracy. They have experienced people who worked in the field that were killed because of what they were studying, which is psychology. Along with the hardship of losing their teachers they didn’t have funding when they needed it to expand. By working together, people of Latin America can make it happen by sticking together and get this field of study back up on its feet again (pg 436-437).\n\n“Latin American psychology has developed as a profession faster than it has as a science” (Baker, Graham, Lawson and Robert 2007) In Latin America there is a high social demand for professional psychologists which is what has helped fuel the need for psychology. Research is especially needed in Latin America because of the constant changing of their social and economic conditions (437). Research in Latin America has recently become implemented in order to help with population control, economic development, and community psychology (Freire, 1970). Liberation psychology which came about in the 19th century was the original attempt to focus on issues such as overcrowding, land reform, and violence (437). Martin Baro defined liberation psychology as “a paradigm in which theories don’t define the problems of the situation; rather, the problems demand or select their own theorization” (Martin-Baro, 1989). Many countries have since taken on this theory and thus created all of the unique indigenous psychologies.\n\nIndian-Asian psychology, like South African and Latin American psychology, suffers \"from a lack of resources stemming from the political and economic instability of both [India and Asia]\" (Lawson, 2007, p. 438). Though it is true that Indian ad Asian (especially Chinese) psychologies were initially very influenced by European and American psychology, local \"social, religious, and philosophical pressures and beliefs\" have since affected the psychology of the region in huge ways (Lawson, 2007, p. 439).\n\nFormal institutions both cultivated and oppressed psychology in the India-Asia region (Lawson, 2007, p. 439). Turbulent and shaky are good words to describe the political atmosphere that these regions endured, which of course was reflected in the field of psychology. The \"lack of intellectual infrastructure as a result of scarce financial resources\" (Lawson, 2007, p. 439) was most certainly felt by specific areas, which in turn led to \"impoverished sociocultural context and centralized government control of resources\" (Lawson, 2007, p. 440).\n\nWhat can be said for psychology in the region is persistence. Even though there are twenty four native languages (each one having various dialects), and even though psychology has only been in the formal academic setting since the early twentieth century when Western psychology entered Calcutta, forward progress has nonetheless been made. Although the \"region has neither an accreditation nor licensing system for psychology programs and practicing psychologist\" (Lawson, 2007, p. 440), there are positive shifts occurring.\n\nThis shift can be seen in the relationship between applied psychology and research psychology. Thankfully, the shift from strictly applied professional psychology to scientific research psychology has begun to gain force (Lawson, 2007, p. 439). It is also important to recognize the shift that has taken place between Western psychology and Indian-Asian psychology. Currently many with \"formal Western training have molded their instruction to better fit their culture, thereby integrating cultural and traditional components into their practices\" (Lawson, 2007, p. 440). Out of this, three different strand of psychology have developed that are specific to this particular region. They are general psychology, country- and region-specific psychology, and native-based weltanschauung psychology (Lawson, 2007, p. 441).\nIndian-Asian people have had very strong ties to their culture and what is going on in their countries. They tend to look at how they have been doing things for many centuries and using it in all the different types of studies. Psychology is no different because they still look to their friends and family for input and advice on what needs to happen. They are very strong in their countries (pg 440).\n\nAccording to Robert B. Lawson, Jean E. Graham, and Kristin M. Baker, psychology has been strongly influenced by the nation’s political turmoil, particularly over the past sixty years (Lawson, Graham, & Baker, 2007, p. 437). Colonial, apartheid, capitalist, and patriarchal forces all influenced South African psychology, resulting in the formation of a psychology faced with adversity; the apartheid period intentionally neglected and isolated the field of psychology so that when South Africa first held democratic elections in the mid-1990s, the problems facing psychology as a science and profession were merely beginning to surface (2007, p. 438).\n\nSouth African psychology during the apartheid period was dominated by political influences, such as selective economic sanctions, segregation, and people being exiled from their native land; the influences of the apartheid period resulted in a grossly underdeveloped psychological field at the time of the fall of the apartheid (Lawson, Graham, & Baker, 2007, p. 438). With approximately 5,000 psychologists for a population of over forty-three million people, practicing clinical psychologists greatly outnumber research psychologists, leaving few South African psychologists capable of crafting broad-scale psychological interventions (2007, p. 438). Today, vast efforts are being made to extend South African psychology beyond its borders, which is mostly due to the apartheid no longer isolating the field form international scholarship (2007, p. 438).\n\nThe first steps for South African psychology in the aftermath of apartheid were to take a more collectivist orientation, indigenous focus, rigorous scholarship, and international exchange (Lawson, Graham, & Baker, 2007, p. 438). South African psychologists face the dilemma of keeping international influence and indigenous psychology in balance with South African perspectives; South Africa is in desperate need of psychologists that are willing and able to assist in overcoming the aftermath of apartheid, especially with issues such as violence, poverty, racism, and HIV/AIDS (2007, p. 439).\n\nWhile the resources available to South African psychologists are limited due to past apartheid constraints, measures are being taken to expand the number of psychologists trained to be basic researchers and field clinical psychologists (Lawson, Graham, & Baker, 2007, p. 439). Psychologists in South Africa race to respond to the social pressures and constraints placed on the field in the apartheid aftermath and there are now multiple efforts underway to develop South African psychology as both a profession and a science (2007, p. 439).\nIn South Africa, they had some tough times. They had to bring in their own as president and he has been working hard to get his country back on its feet after the apartheid. There were lots of racial issues that needed to be resolved and also the improving the people’s trains of thought. Psychology is one of their answers and they are working to get it going even it has taken a while (pg 438).\n\nWith the apartheid system that was established in South Africa major turmoil was caused amongst native and non-native South Africans. The apartheid system was based on laws of segregation, which grew in severity as time passed. Some of the first segregation laws that were established did not allow for whites and \"non-whites\" to interact with each other. Even if these interactions wanted, whites and blacks were not allowed to marry or engage socially. In addition to this, \"white jobs\" and \"black jobs\" were established which also created segregation in the workplace (Lawson, Graham, & Baker, 2007, p. 438). As apartheid progressed into its final stages, black South African citizens were no longer able to live in South Africa; they were sent back to African homelands causing them to lose their citizenship and be exiled (Lawson, Graham, & Baker, 2007, p. 438). Around 1990 the anti-apartheid era began, which helped to reintegrate blacks into the South African society. After receiving pressure from the United States and Great Britain, the apartheid system that once ruled South Africa started to become undone. The constitution in South Africa was rewritten in 1994, which helped usher in Nelson Mandela as the country’s political leader. With the country in his control, he completely outlawed any remainders of the apartheid system (Lawson, Graham, & Baker, 2007, p. 438).\n\nWhile the apartheid system was still in place, South African psychology became extremely underdeveloped due to political power controlling everything in this society. There is little to no diversity amongst psychologists in South Africa. Not only are a majority of the practicing psychologists white, but most of them practice clinical psychology, rather than focusing on research (Lawson, Graham, & Baker, 2007, p. 438). This does not allow much of a chance for many psychological breakthroughs or findings to come out of South Africa. With the apartheid system abolished and a new democratic system in place, the education of psychology is being revamped improving the field greatly. More efforts are being made to encourage South Africans, especially blacks, to join the research field of psychology. Advocates are hoping their efforts will help to improve both basic and applied psychological research, and allow psychology in South Africa to branch out beyond itself (Lawson, Graham, & Baker, 2007, p. 438).\n\nThe Philippine experience has proven that approaching psychology using Western models cannot incorporate the intricacies of Asian cultures (Pe-Pua & Protacio-Marcelino, 2000: 50). In addition, while many commentators have thought of Filipino psychology as a branch of Asian psychology, there is a continuing discussion on what comprise the subject. This will determine whether Filipino psychology is to be placed under the domain of either Asian psychology or Eastern psychology. \n\nFilipino psychology is seen as largely postcolonial and is seen as a kind of liberation psychology, aiming to be familiar with the psychology of subjugated communities by conceptually addressing the oppressive sociopolitical structure in which they exist (Tomaneng, 2015). The approaches (Filipino: \"lapit\") in Filipino psychology are different from that of the West. In Filipino psychology, the subjects are treated as active participants to the research undertaking, called \"kalahok\", who are considered as equal in status to the researcher. The participants are included in the research as a group, and not as individuals - hence, an \"umpukan\", or natural cluster, is required to serve as the participants, per se. The researcher, who merely acts as a facilitator, is introduced to the \"umpukan\" by a \"tulay\" (bridge), who is also a part of the \"umpukan\" and is an esteemed member of the community being studied (Javier, 1996).\n\nCultural views, theories and assumptions within social institutions influence cultures around the world through the application of psychological practices on indigenous populations. The historic, cultural and religious beliefs specific to each population directly affect the application of such psychologies. The specific beliefs of indigenous people must be considered in order to bridge the barrier between psychological ideas and the real world application of these ideas on indigenous people. An excerpt from an article on the American Psychological Associations web site explains this idea and shows how connecting psychology with cultural beliefs can strengthen a doctor patient relationship.\n\n\"Delhi psychologist Aruna Broota, PhD, doesn't let her doctoral training at an American university stand in the way of using Indian folk beliefs in her work. The importance of such beliefs were evident in a recent case in which one of Broota's patients beat his wife. Broota's probing revealed that the husband was angry at his wife for disobeying her mother-in-law by having her child immunized on a day the mother-in-law considered inauspicious. Broota's analysis? The women should have placed a small black mark behind the child's ear to protect him from evil.\"Pardon my saying so, but if there was a white therapist, he would try to be 'rational,'\" says Broota, a psychology professor at the University of Delhi and editor of the Journal of Research and Applications in Clinical Psychology. \"Whereas in India, we try to look into the belief system of the client. I was being ancient as well as modern to create peace in the house\" (Clay, 2002).\"\n\nThis article and many more are available on the APA web site http://www.apa.org/monitor/may02/india.aspx.\n\nIn addition to the broader dimensions of western colonial and cultural influence on indigenous psychologies, there are specific limitations for indigenous psychologies that arise from the pervasive (nearly universal) acceptance of western diagnostic tools as the primary source of diagnostic features/criteria for psychopathology (Thakker & Ward, 1998: Poznyak, Reed, & Clark, 2011). The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision [DMS-IV-TR] (2000), continues to be used as an overarching framework for mental illness across cultures, and may suppress or distort indigenous understandings of mental illness of psychopathological processes. By virtue of its culture-specific origin and oversight the DSM-IV-TR is culturally bound within western ontological paradigms, and thus may not be, in whole or in part, appropriate for the diverse needs of other cultures (Thakker & Ward, 1998).\n\nIt is possible, and imperative, that indigenous psychologies find meaningful points of integration with western psychologies, and may include the systematic operationalization of mental illness within rigorous diagnostic criteria (Lawson, Graham, & Baker, 2007). However, integration towards a global psychology, or other overarching cross-cultural framework of psychological phenomena transcendent of specific cultural ontologies may require the inclusion of paradigms and methodologies that exist apart from traditional western-scientific understandings of rigor. Moreover, diagnostic criteria will remain an important point of conversation and controversy for global psychology, as it jeopardizes the basic ability of researchers to generalize and categorize the prevalence/incidence of mental illness in a global context (Poznyak, Reed, & Clark, 2011).\n\n"}

As is the case with many of her novels, there is a strong focus on nanotechnology and genetic engineering. Also typical of her works, government and corporate corruption plays a large role in the story, in this case as antagonistic suppressors of generally positive and liberating transhumanizing technology.\n\n\"Limit of Vision\" tells the story of a rogue colony of artificial, independently viable neural cells called asterids (nicknamed LOVs, because their size is at the limit of human vision) which escapes from containment aboard a corporate research lab in low Earth orbit. Plummeting to Earth, the colony's habitat lands off the coast of Vietnam, to be picked up by Ela Suvanatat, a freelance journalist. Ela is helped by a group of young children living under the protection of a ROSA (ROving Silicon Agent, a nearly sentient computer program) named \"Mother Tiger\", who see an opportunity to advance their lots in life by cooperating with the LOVs in a form of symbiosis. Events quickly spiral out of control as the corporate lab, \"Equasys\", joins with the UN to eradicate the LOVs.\n\nVirgil Copeland and Randall Panwar are forced to give a project review to the senior staff of \"Equatorial Systems\" alone when their fellow scientist Gabrielle Villanti fails to show up. Panwar stumbles through the presentation, showcasing their life work: asterids (artificial neurons) known as LOVs. Although LOVs showed promise in initial experiments, the enhanced intelligence of the test animals was offset by the uncontrolled growth of the LOVs, which eventually killed their hosts. LOVs were therefore made dependent on two amino acids: nopaline for metabolism and octopine for reproduction. In the second phase of the experiment, the LOVs were encased in silicate shells. These LOVs were able to safely interact with the test animals. Unfortunately, an unrelated incident at a rival biotechnology company prompted a government crackdown, and the LOVs were exported to the \"Hammer\", a space station in low Earth orbit.\n\nPanwar's presentation is cut short when security interrupt with news of an incident at the lab. Gabrielle, Panwar, and Virgil had illegally implanted LOV clusters on their foreheads in order to communicate with the LOV colonies in their care, and Gabrielle had apparently entered a fugue state and died of exhaustion while in communion with their latest experimental subject. Their administrators learn of this shortly when they discover Virgil attempting to surreptitiously remove the LOVs from Gabrielle's corpse, and the two surviving scientists are put into quarantine. Unfortunately, the LOV colony is quite a bit more intelligent and resourceful than anyone had anticipated; it has overcome several obstacles and colonized key areas of the \"Hammer\". When it learns what has happened, it takes control of several drones and severs the lab module from the space station.\n\nEla Suvanatat is a freelance journalist doing a story on the plight of fishing villages in Vietnam when the \"Equasys\" lab module crashes offshore. Although it is quickly declared off limits by the government, Ela hires a boat and makes her way out to the crash site. She is barely able to scoop up a few stray LOVs which have survived atmospheric reentry and get back to shore before the military arrives and cordons off the site.\n\nRacing through the marsh ahead of military patrols, Ela comes into contact with the \"Roi Nuoc\", a group of children under the care of a nearly sentient computer program named \"Mother Tiger\". The \"Roi Nuoc\" take her to one of their benefactors, a businessman named Ky Xuan Nguyen. While cleaning up at his house, Ela discovers that the packet of LOVs has torn and most of her find is missing, but there are a few LOVs lodged in her forehead.\n\nMeanwhile, Virgil and Panwar attempt escape from quarantine, but Panwar is gunned down and Virgil barely makes it to Panwar's one-man automated submarine. Virgil shortly receives from a message from Ela, who is worried that her LOVs seem to be dying. He tells her that crown galls on some plants might contain nopaline, and orders her a supply of both nopaline and octopine tablets from a chemical supply company.\n\nEla is forced to flee her safe house when the military begins a house-to-house search, but she stops along the way to gather crown galls and then asks one of the \"Roi Nuoc\" to lead her back to the pool in which she took shelter after swimming ashore. At the pool, Ela plunges half of her crown galls into the mud, hoping to save any LOVs which had made their way into the water.\n"}

It describes why governments and power-holders monopolize radio, satellite, internet and other media through censorship using regulations, technology and other controls. It has also been used to theorize about what happens when there is a loss of monopoly or oligopoly.\n\nThe theory was originally developed in the 1990s by Monroe Price, professor of law at Cardozo Law School and professor of communication studies at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. His theory explains media regulation in terms of a market with an exchange, not of cash for goods or services, but identity for loyalty.\n\nPrice describes sellers as: \"Sellers in the market are all those for whom myths and dreams and history [i.e. identity] can somehow be converted into power and wealth—classically states, governments, interest groups, business and others.\" Price illustrates buyers, medium of exchange, and their relationship:\n\nThe \"buyers\" are citizens, subjects, nationals, consumers—recipients of packages of information, propaganda, advertisements, drama, and news propounded by the media. The consumer \"pays\" for one set of identities or another in several ways that, together, we call \"loyalty\" or \"citizenship.\"\n\nPayment, however, is not expressed in the ordinary coin of the realm: It includes not only compliance with tax obligations, but also obedience to laws, readiness to fight in armed services, or even continued residence within a country. \nFinally, the concept of identity consists of a party platform, ideology, or national ideals and aspirations. It may be as ephemeral as the hope for a better future or as concrete as the desire for a national homeland. Identity is valuable to buyers as it contains both the legacy of their past history and the promise of their dreams for the future (whether it is for wealth, a better life, or an education).\n\nThe central idea is that governments and power-holders act in such a way as to preserve their control over the market. The theory was applied with respect to markets offering identity through various media—radio and satellite broadcasting and the internet.\n\nWhen a monopoly or oligopoly over the flow of information is lost, the unavoidable consequence is destabilization. Market for Loyalties Theory predicts the consequences of loss of control through the application of the concept of elasticity. \n\nAll other factors being equal, the less elasticity in the market prior to the loss of monopoly or oligopoly, the greater the destabilizing effect of the loss of such control. \n\" Link to graphical illustration of inelasticity.\n\nSubstitute goods consist of two items where \"a rise in the price of one causes an increase in demand for the other.\" In 1926, Marco Fanno, an Italian economist, demonstrated that elasticity (and more importantly, stability) increase with additional substitutes. In the case of the Market for Loyalties, the more substitutes for \"identity\", and be implication the more competition of \"identity\" in the instance of oligopoly, the more elastic the demand curve and the less destabilizing a loss of monopoly or oligopoly over an information environment will have. Furthermore, as the number of competing messages of identity in the Market for Loyalties approaches infinity, the presence of any new message of identity should have infinitesimal effect. Thus, when the concept of elasticity is applied to Market for Loyalties Theory, it creates an argument supporting the broadest possible freedom of speech.\n\nA complete understanding of the economics underlying the loss of monopoly control over the market requires consideration of other factors of elasticity besides substitute goods. Additional consumers of identity, who were sidelined during prior periods of oligopoly. For instance Shi'a were marginalized in Iraq from fully participating in society during Saddam Husein's regime, and the Shi'a presence after the fall of the regime would increase demand in the Market for Loyalties. \n\nAnother important factor affecting elasticity in the Market for Loyalties and stability after loss of monopolized control is the presence of retail and wholesale markets. In Iraq the significance of tribalism, whereby loyalty could be sold \"wholesale\" had the effect of locking in the choices of individuals to their particular tribe. They simply were not free to choose their allegiances. The ultimate effect was to increase the inelasticity of the demand curve, thereby increasing the instability after the Market for Loyalties became more open following the removal of Saddam Husein's regime (the principal censor of information in the market).\n\nHigh transaction costs (the cost of switching loyalty) also can work to create a steep demand curve and instability following monopoly control. The cost of shifting identity with and loyalty to various tribes, political organizations, and religions can be quite high—resulting in a loss of family, friends and social standing and even trigger persecution. In an intolerant society, the high transaction costs of shifting one's identity and loyalty also operate to produce an inelastic demand curve and instability upon opening of a Market for Loyalties that had been previously constricted by monopoly or oligopoly.\n\n"}

Mary McNeal is in a chair and another woman named Mrs. Gustin is laying on a couch. Mary is putting her under hypnosis to find a significant past life. Mrs. Gustin finds herself working in a dress shop during the American Revolutionary war and she discovers this is why she is fearful of men in uniform. When Mrs. Gustin asks if Mary has been able to find a past life, she claims that she has been unable to remember. After Mrs. Gustin leaves, Mary once again tries to hypnotize herself and discover a past life. She awakens the next day on her couch with no new information about any past lives - or so she thinks.\n\nMary arrives at what she thinks is her next appointment and is late. She knocks and discovers that the woman already knows about her past lives and is abruptly shown out. Confused, Mary goes to what she thought was her office only to find it is now an employment counselling center. She tries to find help since she has no idea why everything is different. Jim Sinclair, the man at the employment center, attempts to help her believing she is another unemployed person. She is curious when he asks why she didn't put information about her past lives. When she is unable to recall she panics and leaves. Sinclair calls someone and talks to them about Mary saying that \"she could be the one.\"\n\nLater, Sinclair and another man discuss Mary again and talk about how she might have to be killed. Meanwhile, Mary finds a homeless woman who wants to die and when Mary asks why the homeless woman tells her that she had a pretty good life in her past life but she hates her current life. Mary tries to make her believe that she is needed here and now by Mary herself because she doesn't have anyone or anything. Mary runs to get help but runs into Sinclair and the other man. They drug and kidnap her and when she awakens in an empty warehouse, Mary discovers that because she can't recall her past lives she is deemed worthy by the man and Sinclair. They put her under and she starts talking about herself but still no information about her past lives. When they discover she is telling the truth they want her to help them forget their past lives.\n\nIn this alternate reality everyone remembers all their past lives; being able to remember past grudges, stressful times, and everyday problems from each life. To remember so much can drive someone insane and not only that but they can just die and go on. One can become lethargic and just kill themselves so they can go on to another life. They want her to help them and others quit trying to avenge or yearn for joys from the past and make this life - the present life - much more desirable. They know she has a drive to help others, but most of all she has a gift: the ability to make one forget past lives and all the \"baggage\" that comes with them. Soon, Mary is working with Sinclair to help people forget about their past lives through hypnotism and lead happier lives.\n\n"}

Due to religious dietary restrictions and Shabbat observance the school asked for accommodation in order to participate without violating their religious beliefs. The school asked for two trials to be changed from Saturday to Thursday or Friday in order to avoid violating Shabbat. In response the school obtained attorney Nathan Lewin to represent the school. Lewin filed a complaint with the US Department of Justice alleging religious discrimination and a violation of civil rights. Attorney Elizabeth Price resigned from the Georgia State Bar in protest over the National Board refusing to grant the requests for accommodation. The Anti-Defamation League sent a letter of protest to the National Board complaining against the lack of reasonable accommodation, asking the National Board not to punish children for their religious beliefs. The United States Congress condemned the National Board for failing to provide for these accommodations. On May 7, 2009, Fulton County Superior Court Chief Judge Doris Downs ruled that unless the competition would accommodate the Orthodox Jewish students, then the courthouse would not be allowed to be used for the competition.\n\n"}

Émile Henriot coined the term in an article in the popular French newspaper \"Le Monde\" on May 22, 1957 to describe certain writers who experimented with style in each novel, creating an essentially new style each time. Most of the founding authors were published by Les Éditions de Minuit with the strong support of Jérôme Lindon.\n\nAlain Robbe-Grillet, an influential theorist as well as writer of the Nouveau Roman, published a series of essays on the nature and future of the novel which were later collected in \"Pour un Nouveau Roman\". Rejecting many of the established features of the novel to date, Robbe-Grillet regarded many earlier novelists as old-fashioned in their focus on plot, action, narrative, ideas, and character. Instead, he put forward a theory of the novel as focused on objects: the ideal \"nouveau roman\" would be an individual version and vision of things, subordinating plot and character to the details of the world rather than enlisting the world in their service.\n\nDespite the assertions of \"nouveauté\", this vision of the novel can be construed as developing from earlier writers' suggestions and practice. Joris-Karl Huysmans, ninety years before, had suggested how the novel might be depersonalised; more recently, Franz Kafka had shown that conventional methods of depicting character were not essential; James Joyce had done the same for plot; and absurdist writers had engaged with some of the themes that preoccupied writers of the \"nouveau roman\".\n\nAlain Robbe-Grillet became an elected member of the Académie française on 25 March 2004, succeeding Maurice Rheims at seat No. 32. Claude Simon, the 1985 Nobel Laureate in Literature, is often identified with the \"nouveau roman\" movement. Jean Ricardou is the theorist of the \"nouveau roman\" literary movement.\n\nThe \"Nouveau Roman\" style also left its mark on screen as writers Marguerite Duras and Alain Robbe-Grillet became involved with the Left Bank film movement (often labelled as part of the French New Wave). Their collaboration with director Alain Resnais resulted in critical successes such as \"Hiroshima mon amour\" (1958) and \"Last Year in Marienbad\" (1961). They would later go on to direct their own films.\n\nThe \"Nouveau Roman\" influenced French-language writers in Quebec such as Jacques Godbout and Gerard Bessette. The Canadian-born French writer Nancy Huston declared that she began writing in direct reaction to the stark style of the \"Nouveau Roman\" in \"Nord Perdu\" (1999).

{"id": "13696101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13696101", "title": "Paradox (literature)", "text": "Paradox (literature)\n\nIn literature, the paradox is an anomalous juxtaposition of incongruous ideas for the sake of striking exposition or unexpected insight. It functions as a method of literary composition and analysis that involves examining apparently contradictory statements and drawing conclusions either to reconcile them or to explain their presence.\n\nLiterary or rhetorical paradoxes abound in the works of Oscar Wilde and G. K. Chesterton. Most literature deals with paradox of situation; Rabelais, Cervantes, Sterne, Borges, and Chesterton are recognized as masters of situation as well as verbal paradox. Statements such as Wilde's \"I can resist anything except temptation\" and Chesterton's \"spies do not look like spies\" are examples of rhetorical paradox. Further back, Polonius' observation that \"though this be madness, yet there is method in't\" is a memorable third. Also, statements that are illogical and metaphoric may be called paradoxes, for example: \"The pike flew to the tree to sing.\" The literal meaning is illogical, but there are many interpretations for this metaphor.\n\nCleanth Brooks, an active member of the New Critical movement, outlines the use of reading poems through paradox as a method of critical interpretation. Paradox in poetry means that tension at the surface of a verse can lead to apparent contradictions and hypocrisies. Brooks' seminal essay, \"The Language of Paradox\", lays out his argument for the centrality of paradox by demonstrating that paradox is \"the language appropriate and inevitable to poetry.\" The argument is based on the contention that referential language is too vague for the specific message a poet expresses; he must \"make up his language as he goes.\" This, Brooks argues, is because words are mutable and meaning shifts when words are placed in relation to one another.\n\nIn the writing of poems, paradox is used as a method by which unlikely comparisons can be drawn and meaning can be extracted from poems both straightforward and enigmatic.\n\nBrooks points to William Wordsworth's poem \"It is a beauteous evening, calm and free\". He begins by outlining the initial and surface conflict, which is that the speaker is filled with worship, while his female companion does not seem to be. The paradox, discovered by the poem's end, is that the girl is more full of worship than the speaker precisely because she is always consumed with sympathy for nature and not – as is the speaker – in tune with nature while immersed in it.\n\nIn his reading of Wordsworth's poem, \"Composed upon Westminster Bridge\", Brooks contends that the poem offers paradox not in its details, but in the situation the speaker creates. Though London is a man-made marvel, and in many respects in opposition to nature, the speaker does not view London as a mechanical and artificial landscape but as a landscape composed entirely of nature. Since London was created by man, and man is a part of nature, London is thus too a part of nature. It is this reason that gives the speaker the opportunity to remark upon the beauty of London as he would a natural phenomenon, and, as Brooks points out, can call the houses \"sleeping\" rather than \"dead\" because they too are vivified with the natural spark of life, granted to them by the men that built them.\n\nBrooks ends his essay with a reading of John Donne's poem \"The Canonization\", which uses a paradox as its underlying metaphor. Using a charged religious term to describe the speaker's physical love as saintly, Donne effectively argues that in rejecting the material world and withdrawing to a world of each other, the two lovers are appropriate candidates for canonization. This seems to parody both love and religion, but in fact it combines them, pairing unlikely circumstances and demonstrating their resulting complex meaning. Brooks points also to secondary paradoxes in the poem: the simultaneous duality and singleness of love, and the double and contradictory meanings of \"die\" in Metaphysical poetry (used here as both sexual union and literal death). He contends that these several meanings are impossible to convey at the right depth and emotion in any language but that of paradox. A similar paradox is used in Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\", when Juliet says, \"For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmer's kiss.\"\n\nBrooks' contemporaries in the sciences were, in the 1940s and 50's, reorganizing university science curricula into codified disciplines. The study of English, however, remained less defined and it became a goal of the New Critical movement to justify literature in an age of science by separating the work from its author and critic (see Wimsatt and Beardsley's Intentional fallacy and Affective fallacy) and by examining it as a self-sufficient artifact. In Brooks's use of the paradox as a tool for analysis, however, he develops a logical case as a literary technique with strong emotional effect. His reading of \"The Canonization\" in \"The Language of Paradox\", where paradox becomes central to expressing complicated ideas of sacred and secular love, provides an example of this development.\n\nAlthough paradox and irony as New Critical tools for reading poetry are often conflated, they are independent poetical devices. Irony for Brooks is \"the obvious warping of a statement by the context\" whereas paradox is later glossed as a special kind of qualification that \"involves the resolution of opposites.\"\n\nIrony functions as a presence in the text – the overriding context of the surrounding words that make up the poem. Only sentences such as 2 + 2 = 4 are free from irony; most other statements are prey to their immediate context and are altered by it (take, as an example, the following joke. \"A woman walks into a bar and asks for a \"double entendre\". The bartender gives it to her.\" This last statement, perfectly acceptable elsewhere, is transformed by its context in the joke to an innuendo). Irony is the key to validating the poem because a test of any statement grows from the context – validating a statement demands examining the statement in the context of the poem and determining whether it is appropriate to that context.\n\nParadox, however, is essential to the structure and being of the poem. In \"The Well Wrought Urn\" Brooks shows that paradox was so essential to poetic meaning that paradox was almost identical to poetry. According to literary theorist Leroy Searle, Brooks' use of paradox emphasized the indeterminate lines between form and content. \"The form of the poem uniquely embodies its meaning,\" and the language of the poem \"affects the reconciliation of opposites or contraries.\" While irony functions within the poem, paradox often refers to the meaning and structure of the poem and is thus inclusive of irony. This existence of opposites or contraries and the reconciliation thereof is poetry and the meaning of the poem.\n\nR.S. Crane, in his essay \"The Critical Monism of Cleanth Brooks\", argues strongly against Brooks' centrality of paradox. For one, Brooks believes that the very structure of poetry is paradox, and ignores the other subtleties of imagination and power that poets bring to their poems. Brooks simply believed that, \"'Imagination' reveals itself in the balance or reconciliation of opposite or discordant qualities.\" Brooks, in leaning on the crutch of paradox, only discusses the truth poetry can reveal, and speaks nothing about the pleasure it can give. (231) Also, by defining poetry as uniquely having a structure of paradox, Brooks ignores the power of paradox in everyday conversation and discourse, including scientific discourse, which Brooks claimed was opposed to poetry. Crane claims that, using Brooks' definition of poetry, the most powerful paradoxical poem in modern history is Einstein's formula E = mc, which is a profound paradox in that matter and energy are the same thing. The argument for the centrality of paradox (and irony) becomes a \"reductio ad absurdum\" and is therefore void (or at least ineffective) for literary analysis.\n"}

It aims to create/strengthen awareness of the relationship between phonological awareness skills to reading and writing.\n\nAdapted from Auditory Discrimination in Depth (Lindamood & Lindamood, 1975), which is now known as the Lindamood Phoneme Sequencing (LiPS) Program.\n\nThe PAL introduces identification, segmentation, blending and manipulation of speech sounds in syllables. It does not encourage reading using the whole-word approach instead teaching children to break written words up into individual graphemes and matching letters with their corresponding phonemes before reassembling the phonemes back into words to read.\n\nDeveloping an awareness of linguistic terms: Checks child's understanding of literacy terminology used and teaches the child how to talk about language (metalinguistic skills).\n\nSound–symbol association: Determines child's knowledge of how letters and sounds correspond, and that can be several representations of each sound.\n\nBlock representation of Consonant or vowel sequences: This component facilitates the child's ability to segment words into individual phonemes through developing auditory analysis skills. A single block represents an individual sound, and a row of blocks represent a string of sounds; so that the number of blocks directly correlates to the number of sounds in the sequence.\n\nBlock representation of syllables: Once the child understands that syllables consist of sounds, they then have to count the number of sounds, the order and distinguish between phonetic features. N.B. all block representation tasks deal only with non-words; this is to prevent the child from using pre-learned spelling patterns to respond to the tasks.\n\nReading and spelling non-words: This builds on previously learnt skills by using block representation to read and spell non-words.

The focus of this level is the ability to decode and encode CVC syllables, before applying this skill in reading and spelling. This incorporates the learning of long and short vowels in addition to consonants. Words used at this level have consistent grapheme-phoneme correspondences (GPCs).\n\nLevel 2 (complex words): Consonant clusters are introduced, in addition to application of specific rules (e.g. borrower c and g, and Magic E).\n\nLevel 3 (multisyllabic words): Specific teaching on how to break words up into syllables and the introduction of grammatical morphemes. This level builds on the previously learned abilities of segmenting and manipulating sounds by transferring these skills to syllables within multisyllabic words.\n\nThe manual\nColoured blocks, letter tiles\nRecord sheets and file/folder\nSuitable reinforcement (stickers, stamps etc.)\n\nTherapy should be delivered by a suitably qualified speech therapist.\n\nReading Freedom Remedial Reading Program (Calder, 1992)\n\nSounds Abound.

Pictorial carpets are usually framed to sell and use.\n\nThe very concept and expectations of Persian rugs slowly started to change over the past 25 years. The original tableau rug, also known as pictorial carpet is not known when it was weaved together but some of the old rugs back in 19th & 20th century show that the similar type design were used such as hunting scene in Isfahan or Qum carpet as well as floral design in Isfahan and Tabriz carpet.\n\nAlso picturesque scenes from ancient Persia showing the king and his wife is another example. After the 1979 revolution in Iran, the whole industry started to change and many of the original patterns which were famous in Iran were exported to many countries which they have started producing similar products with much lower quality such as China, Turkish, Afghanistan, India etc. and unfortunately selling them in the global market known as Persian design carpets. This have hurt the industry significantly which the export of the Persian rugs has been reducing year by year after the revolution. At the same time a new trend slowly started to take shape as part of the Persian rug culture and Iranian came to a conclusion since they are best known carpet weaver and the oldest known carpet maker in the world & modern society, why not to re-produce some of the most famous, well known and rare art works from across the globe in the new product known as “tableau rug”. What is known is that now this is a new trend in the ancient world of Persian rug.\n\nPictorial carpets are being woven exactly the same way as the Persian rug has been made over the past 2500 years so there is no different in quality. The main different is that in pictorial carpet, there is not the ancient design and it always has a picture or scenery that are much more colorful with many different scenes. They can be framed the same way as an art work or painting and they are designed to be hung on the wall.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44334925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44334925", "title": "Polandball", "text": "Polandball\n\nPolandball, also known as countryballs, refers to user-generated visual art, typically manifesting as online comics, where countries are personified as (typically) spherical personas decorated with their country's flag, interacting in often broken English named \"Engrish\" (with the exception of countryballs that speak English natively). The characters poke fun at national stereotypes and international relations, as well as historical conflicts. It is an Internet meme which originated on the /int/ board of German imageboard Krautchan.net in the latter half of 2009.\n\nThe comics style may be referred to both as \"Polandball\" (by convention, even in cases where there is no Poland among the cartoon characters) and \"countryball\" (or, collectively, \"countryballs\").\n\nPolandball has its roots in an August 2009 \"cyberwar\" between Polish Internet users and the rest of the world on drawball.com. The website, which offers a virtual canvas, allows Internet users to draw whatever they want, and to draw over others' drawings. On the Internet in Poland, an idea was raised to draw the Polish flag on the ball, and thousands of Poles together managed to take over the drawball with a painting of white on top of red, with the word \"POLSKA\" written in the middle. After co-ordination from 4chan, this was then covered over by a giant swastika.\n\nKrautchan.net is a German-language imageboard whose /int/ board is frequented by English-speaking netizens. The beginning of the Polandball meme is credited to \"Falco\", a British user on /int/, who created the meme in September 2009 using Microsoft Paint in an apolitical way to troll \"Wojak\", a Pole on the same board who contributes in broken English, after which Polandball cartoons were enthusiastically drawn by Russians.\n\nPolandball comics have no defined authors, and anyone is able to make one. This has become an internet meme, presented e.g., at Reddit and Facebook.\n\nThe premise of Polandball is that it represents Poland and its history, relations with other countries and stereotypes, focusing on Polish megalomania and national complexes. With the exception of English-speaking ones, interactions between countryballs tend to be written in broken English and Internet slang, reminiscent of the lolcat meme, and by the end of the cartoon Poland, which is purposely represented as red on top of white (the reverse of the Polish flag), is typically seen weeping.\n\nSome Polandball comics arise from the premise that Russia can fly into space, whilst Poland can not. (Although in reality, a Polish astronaut, Mirosław Hermaszewski, did fly into space aboard the Soviet Soyuz 30 spacecraft in 1978.)\n\nOne of the most popular Polandball comics begins with the premise that Earth is going to be struck by a giant meteor, leading to all countries with space technology leaving Earth and going into orbit around the planet. At the end of the cartoon, Poland, still on earth, is crying, and in broken English pronounces the canonical Polandball catchphrase \"Poland cannot into space\". In this humorous way, Russians put a halt to all discussion with Poles on which country is superior.\n\nPolandball can also include comics on other countries, but by convention these comics are usually still referred to as Polandball, although they can also be called countryballs. Countries are also represented as balls, although there are many novel exceptions. Singapore, Bermuda, and more rarely the Colombian department Nariño take the form of a triangle, in which Singapore is sometimes referred to as \"Tringapore\". Nepal (sometimes called \"Nepalrawr\") is in the shape of its national flag (one triangle on top of another) and has teeth. There are a few other \"rawrs\" like Nepal, such as the Maratha Empire and the state of Ohio. The German Empire of 1871–1918 (on Facebook and elsewhere) or the theoretical Fourth Reich (on Reddit) is a tall rectangle with small eyes and is known as \"Reichtangle\". Israel as well as the Jewish Autonomous Oblast takes the form of a hypercube (in reference to Jewish physics). The State of Michigan is also commonly depicted as a cube. Kazakhstan takes the form of a brick sometimes called \"Kazakhbrick\", due to Kazakhstan being the only country whose flag icon was inadvertently not changed to a ball on Krautchan. Omsk, a city in Russia, generally takes the form of a malevolent bird or humanoid entity, and is based on a drawing by German artist Heiko Müller titled \"Winged Doom\". Many countries also have established accessories. The United States sports a pair of shades, the United Kingdom wears a monocle and a top hat (as does Hong Kong, since it was once a territory of the United Kingdom) and Canada is often seen wearing a coonskin cap. Indonesia is always drawn with either a songkok or Asian conical hat to distinguish it from Poland (given its upside-down flag), with Monaco also distinguishing itself by often being drawn extremely small. Vatican City also regularly wears a mitre. Other noted countryballs include countries whose emblems are offset to the hoist of their flags (i.e Serbia and Slovakia) which are usually depicted as eyepatches, with Austria-Hungary often being depicted as blind while wearing two eyepatches. The orientation of the star and crescent on the flag of Mauritania give the appearance that the countryball is perpetually smiling. India is sometime shown wearing a turban with some Hindu and traditional markings on its forehead.\n\nThe simplicity of Polandball, added with its recognition of world history and a focus on current affairs, makes the meme suited to commenting on international events. Amongst events which have been covered by Polandball and have been noted in the media, are the Senkaku Islands dispute, the 2013 papal conclave which saw Jorge Mario Bergoglio being elected as the new Pope, the 2014 Ukrainian crisis, the 2014 Crimean crisis and issues relating to Filipino workers in Taiwan.\n\nA report on the Russian radio station Vesti FM noted a post on Livejournal which asked readers to list five images that come to mind when thinking of Poland or Poles. The five pages of responses, illustrating the deep historical ties between Russia and Poland, recalled subjects including False Dmitriy I, \"Tomek in the Land of the Kangaroos\" by Polish author Alfred Szklarski, \"Czterej pancerni i pies\" (\"Four tank-men and a dog\"), Russophobia and Polandball.\n\nWojciech Oleksiak, writing on culture.pl, a project of the Polish government-funded Adam Mickiewicz Institute which has the aim of promoting Polish language and culture abroad, noted that due to anyone being able to create a Polandball comic, the existence of the meme has created new opportunities for people to express their personal views on race, religion and history. In describing Polandball as the Internet \"par excellence\", he further stated that comic plots can be \"rude, impolite, racist, abusive, or just plain dumb\", whilst also noting that the politically incorrect nature of the comics add to the attractiveness of the meme.\n\nAt the same time, Oleksiak notes that Polandball comics often employ exaggerated Polish stereotypes, such as Poles not being as proficient in English as other nationalities, and Poland itself being a country full of dull-witted psycho-Catholics. On the other hand, some stereotypes employed in Polandball comics, such as Poles telling stories about the nation's glorious history and dwelling on a deep rooted martyrdom, are mostly true; whilst the stereotype that Poles hold many national complexes and blame external forces for their own failures, is true, but somewhat justified.\n\nOleksiak further notes that from Polandball, Poles can learn to have \"a sense of humour about our long-time grudges\".\n\n"}

{"id": "44160271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44160271", "title": "Relationship maintenance", "text": "Relationship maintenance\n\nRelationship maintenance (or relational maintenance) refers to a variety of behaviors exhibited by relational partners in an effort to maintain that relationship. Relational maintenance is defined by scholars in four different ways:\n\nFirst, in order to keep a relationship in existence (for example, adult friends that contact each other infrequently, but adequately to maintain the friendship), means the relationship continues without termination. Second, in order to keep a relationship in a specified state or condition, human communication professors Kathryn Dindia and Daniel Canary \"refers to sustaining the present level of certain dimensions or qualities thought to be important in relationship development.\" There are three elements of a stable relationship: \n\nDindia and Canary's third definition of relational maintenance refers to keeping a relationship in a satisfactory condition or to maintain satisfaction within the relationship. \"For example, this third definition implies that no one can be in a stable, but dissatisfying relationship.\" Fourthly, to keep a relationship in repair means to keep the relationship in good, sound, or working condition and to repair a relationship that has come apart. Repair of the relationship means \"changing a relationship from its present condition and restoring it to a previous (more advanced) state after decline or decay.\"\n\nWhen maintaining a relationship, any behavior that is positive and promotes deepening trust and closeness between people is a prosocial maintenance behavior. The more prosocial behavior is evident in a relationship, the more likely for strong bonds to be formed, and the relationship to prosper and continue. Low levels of Prosocial maintenance behavior gives less reinforcement in the relationship, and thus more a weak foundation often leads to the relationships deterioration, or at least non-progression.\n\nSpecific prosocial maintenance behaviors that could be exhibited by prosocial standards are positivity, openness, assurances, social networking, task sharing, supportiveness, romance, humor, and joint activities. Each of these qualities equates to spending time together, and interacting either physically or emotionally.\n\nProsocial maintenance behavior does not value one source of positivity more than the other, although the individual might. Verbalizing your fondness for your partner through positive speech might be what your partner specifically craves in your relationship, while another partner might find more affection in your willingness to help with household chores together. This type of task sharing is also a part of what is known as \"routine maintenance\", and a relatively equal effort by each party is a prosocial function that greatly adds to relationship satisfaction.\n\nAs a contrast to prosocial behavior that is used to strengthen bonds and reinforce a relationship, anti-social maintenance behavior is another strategic behavior pattern that can be used to maintain a current relationship. Its use of continuing a relationship at its current level, would be to decline invitations to opportunities to create new levels of a relationship. By declining these opportunities, this exemplifies an Antisocial behavior, which is generally deliberate in its implementation.\n\nModes of communication vary from spoken to written, verbal to nonverbal, and face-to-face to computer-mediated. Depending on the mode of communication, the same message can be interpreted in a different way. Therefore, different types of relationships can be maintained through different types of communication.\n\nFace-to-face communication affords the greatest opportunity for precise communication because immediate feedback from the receiver can tell whether the message has been understood accurately. Technology today provides limited face-to-face communication to everyone, even those separated by long distance. Businesses have used videoconferencing for many years but programs like Skype now allow a personal face-to-face conversation with anyone in the world. With the technological advancements that have taken place over the past decade, communication has also evolved from handwritten letters to emails and text messaging and significantly shortened response times.\n\nRomantic and close personal relationships use more openness and assurance maintenance behaviors and these are easier to communicate in person. But even these close connections are relying on more computer mediated communication today. Texting can have many uses, from coordinating task sharing to simply letting someone know you are thinking about them. People may use Facebook to plan activities with others, announce new relationships, and provide support and encouragement to those in need. Even the birthday card has migrated online. Although technology cannot replace face-to-face communication in these cases, it can supplement and reinforce the importance of the relationship.\n\nCasual connections do not need the same amount of attention as close friendships and romantic relationships. Although there may be some face-to-face communication or telephone calls, social media such as Facebook is enough to maintain an acquaintanceship. Here they can post photos and comments to maintain contact and keep up on each other's lives. If someone is having a bad day, they can provide the necessary support and positivity needed to maintain the relationship.\n\nSome relationships start and stay online. Individuals may meet through a message board or on Facebook while living hundreds of miles away. These virtual relationships require the least amount of maintenance. People in a virtual-only relationship may be highly committed to each other and display just as much maintenance behavior as those in close proximity.\n\nA drawback to using only computer mediated communication is idealization which occurs when a person in a relationship describes the relationship and partner in an unrealistically positive manner. Idealization often will reflect unreal expectations. Mediated communication allows people to control every aspect of the message and they can present an image of themselves that is not real. Facebook relationship maintenance follows implicit rules for interaction. People expect others to present themselves on Facebook in a positive manner and even to limit a post of anything that could hurt their own image or that of a friend. Even if those in a virtual or long-distance relationship do arrange to meet in person, it is usually set up well in advance and allows time to prepare for control of the encounter to reinforce the online image rather than the reality of their life.\n\nDespite its drawbacks, computer-mediated communication has changed the way people maintain relationships. Through the technological advancements that have taken place over the past twenty years, communication has evolved from handwritten letters to emails to text messaging to Facebook to Skype, significantly shortening response times with every step. The increased use and familiarity with technology, even as it evolves, will result in user's adaptation to computer mediated communication and reduce some of the advantages of face-to-face communication. However, the amount of time spent together improves the satisfaction in any relationship and face-to-face communication is still recommended whenever possible.\n\nBehavior patterns in a relationship can be classified as being \"strategic\" or \"routine\". Both are common behaviors, though they are embodied in different ways and perhaps with different ulterior motives.\n\nA \"strategic\" maintenance behavior is an action that is strategically carried out to help maintain a relationship. When you phone somebody to congratulate them on a birthday or anniversary, it is a deliberate action that clearly shows you taking the time to show your affection for someone you have a relationship with. These are clear strategic behaviors designed to give positive reinforcement.\n\nA \"routine\" maintenance behavior is less strategic and has more to do with the everyday tasks in life. For example, if a wife is cleaning up from dinner, and her husband decides to take out the trash. This would be considered a Routine Maintenance Behavior. They are used without the express purposes of maintaining a relationship, yet they still help people preserve their bonds with one another.\n\nStatistically, couples have shown that routine maintenance means more to their relationship than strategic maintenance does. Part of this has to do with the difference in routine maintenance and an exchange relationship. The key difference being that benefits are given without one expected in return, as in an exchange relationship. From this perspective the maintenance and enhancement of close relationships depends on the extent that both people are concerned for each other's needs, and are willing and able to meet those needs.\n\nRomantic relationships have an extra element that is not found in friendship relationships. In romantic relationships, there is the intimacy element that is added. This is physical intimacy and a deeper emotional intimacy than a friendship would have. There are four relationship stages when it comes to romantic relationships:\n\nIt was reported that married and engaged couples used more assurances and task sharing than did dating couples. However, engaged and seriously dating couples reported that they used openness and positivity more than did married couples. Then, married couples reported the most social networking. Daters tended to be more social with one another. For example, they called and sent each other notes and cards more than the married couples did.\n\nPartners tend to disclose more information early on in their relationship stages then they do after they get to know one another better.\n\nIn the marriage stage of relationships, couples tend to have a curvilinear pattern. They use maintenance behavior early on in the relationship and then also in the later years of their marriage. Partners tend to be very excited about the new marriage and work at the relationship maintenance. As the years progress they may shift focus to family or careers, but then later on when their children have grown and they are settled in their careers the focus may come back to the relationship maintenance since the couple have less distractions.\n\nThere are four types of cross-sex friendships that are different in terms of romantic intent. Strictly platonic groups have both sides saying they do not want anything romantic out of the relationship. Those in mutual romance groups both want the friendship to become romantic. Individuals in a desires-romance group indicate that they wanted the friendship to become romantic, but the partner indicate they want to stay friends. Last, the rejects-romance group said that they would like the friendship to stay platonic, but the other person wanted it to become romantic.\n\nFriends who have romantic intentions are more likely to use prosocial maintenance behavior. Friends that want to move to romantic relationships use more maintenance behaviors, as increases in maintenance behavior mark a change from friendship to romance.\n\nGroups that wished to keep the relationship platonic or with only one person interested in romance utilize less relationship maintenance. These groups tend to talk about outside relationships and there is activity done together and less flirtations used.\n\nThis type of relationship can be one of the most challenging relationships to maintain. One of the main challenges in maintaining a long-distance relationship is the lack of face-to-face contact and communication. Face-to-face communication is thought to be the adhesive that holds a romantic relationship together. When couples are able to have face-to-face communication, they are able to do things together, and interact with each other in a physical manner.\n\nPeople in long-distance relationships typically use less maintenance behaviors, such as openness, assurances, and joint activities, than people that are in a geographically close relationship.\n\nIndividuals in long-distance relationships are usually on their best behavior when they are able to be together in person. Compared to couples in geographically close relationships, people in long-distance relationships tend to engage in less joint activities, task sharing, and social networking.\n\nWhen compared to couples in proximal relationships, partners in long-distance relationship often perceive that their communication with one another was more restricted but of higher quality. It may be the quality of the communication rather than the quantity that is most important in keeping a lasting long-distance relationship working.\n\nKnapp's relational development model outlines a form by which relationships are formed and dissolve. The building up and breaking down of relationships is given in ten stages. Maintenance in Knapp's model accounts for the struggle that exist between the fifth stage, bonding, and the sixth stage, differentiation.\n\nBonding allows a dyad to demonstrate to society that they are connected, such as through a marriage ceremony. Differentiation allows for individuals in the couple to maintain their personal space, such as through having their own friends, hobbies, or careers. Relationship maintenance exists in the delicate balance between bonding and differentiation. Should a couple begin to differentiate to a great degree, they will likely begin to fall into relationship dissolution.\n\nRelationships in both romantic and business manners can be identified through ten steps, which Mark Knapp identified and named Knapp's relationship model. The first five steps involved are coming together stages known as escalation, and the termination or de-escalation model. The stages of a relationship can be compared to an elevator ride and how it goes either up to higher levels of intimacy, or goes down to termination. Time spent on each level may differ depending on speed of the relationship or intimacy shared. Different levels can remain the highest stage if we don't find what we are looking for and turn around back to the beginning. On the other hand, levels can be entirely skipped or surpassed. Researchers agree that relationships are always moving either forward or back, and communication indicators can determine the stage of the relationship.\n\nContrary to the escalation stages are the termination stages. Termination can be sensed even before it happens through non-verbal cues such as a decrease in physical touch, eye contact, etc.\n\nAfter the termination stages runs its course, relationships often return to the friendship status or in the unfortunate scenario, complete avoidance. If relationships started in the friendship stage and comes to an end in a positive note, friendship status is more likely to be achieved.\n\n"}
{"id": "3225161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3225161", "title": "Renaissance of the 12th century", "text": "Renaissance of the 12th century\n\nThe Renaissance of the 12th century was a period of many changes at the outset of the high Middle Ages. It included social, political and economic transformations, and an intellectual revitalization of Western Europe with strong philosophical and scientific roots. These changes paved the way for later achievements such as the literary and artistic movement of the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century and the scientific developments of the 17th century.\n\nThe groundwork for the rebirth of learning was laid by the process of political consolidation and centralization of the monarchies of Europe. This process of centralization began with Charlemagne (768–814) King of the Franks and later (800–814), Holy Roman Emperor. Charlemagne's inclination towards education, which led to the creation of many new churches and schools where students were required to learn Latin and Greek, has been called the \"Carolingian Renaissance.\" A second \"renaissance\" occurred during the reign of Otto I (The Great) (936–973) King of the Saxons and from 962 onwards Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Otto was successful in unifying his kingdom and asserting his right to appoint bishops and archbishops throughout his kingdom. Otto's assumption of this ecclesiastical power brought him into close contact with the best educated and ablest class of men in his kingdom. Because of this close contact many new reforms were introduced in the Saxon Kingdom and in the Holy Roman Empire. Thus, Otto's reign has also been called a \"renaissance.\" Therefore, the Renaissance of the twelfth century has been identified as the third and final of the medieval renaissances. Yet the renaissance of the twelfth century was far more thoroughgoing than those renaissances that preceded in the Carolingian or in the Ottonian periods. Indeed, Charlemagne's \"Carolingian Renaissance\" was really more particular to Charlemagne himself, and was really more of a \"veneer on a changing society\" than a true renaissance springing up from society, and the same might be said of the Ottonian Renaissance.\n\nCharles H. Haskins was the first historian to write extensively about a renaissance that ushered in the High Middle Ages starting about 1070. In 1927, he wrote that:\nBritish art historian Kenneth Clark wrote that Western Europe's first \"great age of civilisation\" was ready to begin around the year 1000. From 1100, he wrote, monumental abbeys and cathedrals were constructed and decorated with sculptures, hangings, mosaics and works belonging to one of the greatest epochs of art and providing stark contrast to the monotonous and cramped conditions of ordinary living during the period. Abbot Suger of the Abbey of St. Denis is considered an influential early patron of Gothic architecture and believed that love of beauty brought people closer to God: \"The dull mind rises to truth through that which is material\". Clark calls this \"the intellectual background of all the sublime works of art of the next century and in fact has remained the basis of our belief of the value of art until today\".\n\nLegal historian Vanja Hamzić noted:\n<br>\nInterested in gender and sexual diversity in this period, Hamzić considers \"an unlikely rise of neo-Roman European civil law and Seljuk proto-civil legality and its formidable effect on two paradigmatic twelfth-century intellectual debates on the public, legal and theological standing of 'sodomy' (\"peccatum sodomiticum\", \"liwāṭ\"): one in amongst prominent Benedictines and the other between the leading Ḥanafī scholars\". He argues that these debates, \"led in the distinct spirit of \"concordia discors\" (discordant harmony) or \"ikhtilāf\" (permissible scholarly disagreement), are indispensable for our understanding of legal and social aspects of sexual and gender diversity in the twelfth century and, in turn, the way in which certain rapturous pluralities were continued and ruptured—concomitantly\". This complicates the story of the twelfth-century Renaissance as a site of both progressive and deeply troubled legal, religious and social developments.\n\nThe translation of texts from other cultures, especially ancient Greek works, was an important aspect of both this Twelfth-Century Renaissance and the latter Renaissance (of the 15th century), the relevant difference being that Latin scholars of this earlier period focused almost entirely on translating and studying Greek and Arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics, while the later Renaissance focus was on literary and historical texts.\n\nIn Northern Europe, the Hanseatic League was founded in the 12th century, with the foundation of the city of Lübeck in 1158–1159. Many northern cities of the Holy Roman Empire became Hanseatic cities, including Hamburg, Stettin, Bremen and Rostock. Hanseatic cities outside the Holy Roman Empire were, for instance, Bruges, London and the Polish city of Danzig (Gdańsk). In Bergen and Novgorod the league had factories and middlemen. In this period the Germans started colonizing Eastern Europe beyond the Empire, into Prussia and Silesia.\n\nThe era of the Crusades brought large groups of Europeans into contact with the technologies and luxuries of Byzantium for the first time in many centuries. Crusaders returning to Europe brought numerous small luxuries and souvenirs with them, stimulating a new appetite for trade, carried out by both the Hanseatic League/Rus via the Black Sea routes, as well as rising Italian maritime powers such as Genoa and Venice. \n\nIn the mid 13th century, the \"Pax Mongolica\" re-invigorated the land-based trade routes between China and West Asia that had fallen dormant in the 9th and 10th centuries. Following the Mongol incursion into Europe in 1241, the Pope and some European rulers sent clerics as emissaries and/or missionaries to the Mongol court; these included William of Rubruck, Giovanni da Pian del Carpini, Andrew of Longjumeau, Odoric of Pordenone, Giovanni de Marignolli, Giovanni di Monte Corvino, and other travelers such as Niccolò da Conti. While the accounts of Carpini et al were written in Latin as letters to their sponsors, the account of the later Italian traveler Marco Polo, who followed his father and uncle as far as China, was written first in French c.1300 and later in other popular languages, making it relatively accessible to larger groups of Europeans.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, Western Europe had entered the Middle Ages with great difficulties. Apart from depopulation and other factors, most classical scientific treatises of classical antiquity, written in Greek or Latin, had become unavailable. Philosophical and scientific teaching of the Early Middle Ages was based upon the few Latin translations and commentaries on ancient Greek scientific and philosophical texts that remained in the Latin West, the study of which remained at minimal levels. Only the Christian church maintained copies of these written works, and they were periodically replaced and distributed to other churches.\n\nThis scenario changed during the renaissance of the 12th century. For several centuries, popes had been sending clerics to the various kings of Europe. Kings of Europe were typically illiterate. Literate clerics would be specialists of some subject or other, such as music, medicine or history etc., otherwise known as Roman cohors amicorum, the root of the Italian word corte 'court'. As such, these clerics would become part of a king's retinue or court, educating the king and his children, paid for by the pope, whilst facilitating the spread of knowledge into the Middle Ages. The church maintained classic scriptures in scrolls and books in numerous scriptoriums across Europe, thus preserving the classic knowledge and allowing access to this important information to the European kings. In return, kings were encouraged to build monasteries that would act as orphanages, hospitals and schools, benefiting societies and eventually smoothing the transition from the Middle Ages.\n\nThe increased contact with the Islamic world in Muslim-dominated Spain and Sicily, the Crusades, the Reconquista, as well as increased contact with Byzantium, allowed Western Europeans to seek and translate the works of Hellenic and Islamic philosophers and scientists, especially the works of Aristotle. Several translations were made of Euclid but no extensive commentary was written until the middle of the 13th century.\n\nThe development of medieval universities allowed them to aid materially in the translation and propagation of these texts and started a new infrastructure which was needed for scientific communities. In fact, the European university put many of these texts at the center of its curriculum, with the result that the \"medieval university laid far greater emphasis on science than does its modern counterpart and descendent.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the 13th century, there were reasonably accurate Latin translations of the main ancient Greek scientific works. From then on, these texts were studied and elaborated, leading to new insights into the phenomena of the universe. The influence of this revival is evident in the scientific work of Robert Grosseteste.\n\nDuring the High Middle Ages in Europe, there was increased innovation in means of production, leading to economic growth.\n\nAlfred Crosby described some of this technological revolution in \"The Measure of Reality : Quantification in Western Europe, 1250-1600\" and other major historians of technology have also noted it.\n\nThe early 12th century saw a revival of the study of Latin classics, prose, and verse before and independent of the revival of Greek philosophy in Latin translation. The Cathedral schools at Chartres, Orleans, and Canterbury were centers of Latin literature staffed by notable scholars. John of Salisbury, secretary at Canterbury, became the bishop of Chartres. He held Cicero in the highest regard in philosophy, language, and the humanities. Latin humanists possessed and read virtually all the Latin authors we have today—Ovid, Virgil, Terence, Horace, Seneca, Cicero. The exceptions were few—Tacitus, Livy, Lucretius. In poetry, Virgil was universally admired, followed by Ovid.\n\nLike the earlier Carolingian revival, the 12th-century Latin revival would not be permanent. While religious opposition to pagan Roman literature existed, Haskins argues that “it was not religion but logic” in particular “Aristotle’s New Logic toward the middle of [the 12th] century [that] threw a heavy weight on the side of dialectic ...” at the expense of the letters, literature, oratory, and poetry of the Latin authors. The nascent universities would become Aristotelean centers displacing the Latin humanist heritage until its final revival by Petrarch in the 14th century.\n\nThe study of the Digest was the first step to the revival of Roman legal jurisprudence and the establishment of Roman law as the basis of civil law in continental Europe. The Bologna University was Europe's center of legal scholarship during this period.\n\nA new method of learning called scholasticism developed in the late 12th century from the rediscovery of the works of Aristotle; the works of medieval Muslims and Jews influenced by him, notably Maimonides, Avicenna (see Avicennism) and Averroes (see Averroism). The great scholastic scholars of the 13th century were Albertus Magnus, Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas. Those who practiced the scholastic method defended Roman Catholic doctrines through secular study and logic. Other notable scholastics (\"schoolmen\") included Roscelin and Peter Lombard. One of the main questions during this time was the problem of the universals. Prominent non-scholastics of the time included Anselm of Canterbury, Peter Damian, Bernard of Clairvaux, and the Victorines.\n\nThe 12th-century renaissance saw a revival of interest in poetry. Writing mostly in their own native languages, contemporary poets produced significantly more work than those of the Carolingian Renaissance. The subject matter varied wildly across epic, lyric, and dramatic. Meter was no longer confined to the classical forms and began to diverge into newer schemes. Additionally, the division between religious and secular poetry became smaller. In particular, the Goliards were noted for profane parodies of religious texts.\n\nThese expansions of poetic form contributed to the rise of vernacular literature, which tended to prefer the newer rhythms and structures.\n\n\n\n"}

It can refer to a flight schedule, a baseball schedule, or any other type of schedule. In the context of amateur radio a sked is a pre-arranged or scheduled contact between ham radio operators. In boating, a sked is a pre-arranged check-in via VHF radio with a monitoring agency (rescue, fishing or other) while undertaking a long journey or when at sea for an longer than normal time. This is done for safety purposes to enable a search to start early if something untoward happens.\n\nA sked is a pocket-sized bifold or trifold schedule about the size of a baseball card printed for a sports team. Typically, a team logo or an image associated with the team (a player or the stadium or arena, for example) appears on the front, one or more sponsors are listed on the back. Inside is a listing of the season's home and away games.\n\nSkeds are collected as sports memorabilia, trading heavily enough on Ebay to merit a category. Older schedules are like individual works of art, many featuring beautiful artwork, logos and pictures of many stars and hall of fame players. Often variations are available with different sponsors. Schedules can also be quite scarce. Most were put in a wallet and seldom survived past that season, and quantities produced are a lot lower than Topps or Upper Deck baseball cards. This makes them desirable as a collectible since many baseball card collectors feel that current baseball card production rates are too high.\n\nThe first reference to sports schedule collecting may be in The Sports Collectors Bible (1979). Collectors tend to use the moniker \"skedder\" to identify themselves. Many collectors first realized there were others who collected schedules when they saw ads in the back of Sports publications, advertising schedules for sale or schedules that advertisers were looking for. Collectors began to publish newsletters focused solely on schedules that were distributed to other collectors. Newsletters were made up of sked lists by sport, editorial pieces, and ads from Skedders about schedules they had for sale or trade or schedules they were in search of.\n"}
{"id": "24455791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24455791", "title": "Synthetic morphology", "text": "Synthetic morphology\n\nSynthetic morphology is a sub-discipline of the broader field of synthetic biology.\n\nIn standard synthetic biology, artificial gene networks are introduced into cells, inputs (e.g. chemicals, light) are applied to those networks, and the networks perform logical operations on them and output the result of the operation as the activity of an enzyme or as the amount of green fluorescent protein. Using this approach, synthetic biologists have demonstrated the ability of their gene networks to perform Boolean computation, to hold a memory, and to generate pulses and oscillation. \n\nSynthetic morphology extends this idea by adding output modules that alter the shape or social behaviour of cells in response to the state of the artificial gene network. For example, instead of just making a fluorescent protein, a gene network may switch on an adhesion molecule so that cells stick to each other, or activate a motility system so that cells move. It has been argued that the formation of properly-shaped tissues by mammalian cells involves mainly a set of about ten basic cellular events (cell proliferation, cell death, cell adhesion, differential adhesion, cell de-adhesion, cell fusion, cell locomotion, chemotaxis, haptotaxis, cell wedging). Broadly similar lists exist for tissues of plants, fungi etc. In principle, therefore, a fairly small set of output modules might allow biotechnologists to 'program' cells to produce artificially-designed arrangements, shapes and eventually 'tissues'. \n\nThe term synthetic morphology was introduced to the peer reviewed scientific literature in 2008 and is now becoming more widely used both in peer-reviewed literature and texts.\n"}

{"id": "404176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=404176", "title": "The Knight's Tale", "text": "The Knight's Tale\n\n\"The Knight's Tale\" () is the first tale from Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\".\n\nThe Knight is described by Chaucer in the \"General Prologue\" as the person of highest social standing amongst the pilgrims, though his manners and clothes are unpretentious. We are told that he has taken part in some fifteen crusades in many countries and also fought for one pagan leader against another. However though the list of campaigns, mentioned by Chaucer, is real, \"and though it was perhaps just possible for one man to have been in them all, [it] is probably idealized.\" Chaucer's portrait of the Knight in the \"Prologue\" \"is generally thought to show a man of unsullied ideals, though some see him as a mercenary.\" He is accompanied on his pilgrimage by the Squire, his 20-year-old son.\n\nThe story introduces various typical aspects of knighthood such as courtly love and ethical dilemmas. \nThe epic poem \"Teseida\" (full title \"Teseida delle Nozze d’Emilia\", or \"The Theseid, Concerning the Nuptials of Emily\") by Giovanni Boccaccio is the source of the tale, although Chaucer makes many significant diversions from that poem. The \"Teseida\" has 9,896 lines in twelve books, while \"The Knight's Tale\" has only 2,250 lines—though it is still one of the longer poems in the \"Tales\". Most of the epic characteristics of the \"Teseida\" are removed, and instead the poem conforms primarily to the genre of romance; there are no epic invocations; the fighting and mythological references are severely reduced; Theseus' conquests, the assault on Thebes, and the epic catalogue of heroes fighting for Palamon and Arcite are all severely compressed.\n\nThe tale is considered a chivalric romance, yet it is markedly different from either the English or French traditions of such tales. For instance, there is the inclusion of philosophical themes—mainly of the kind contained in the \"Consolation of Philosophy\" of Boethius—astrological references and an epic context.\n\nThe following tale by the Miller also involves the conflict between two men over a woman. It is a direct antithesis to the Knight's, with none of the nobility or heritage of classical mythology, but is instead rollicking, bawdy, comedic, and designed to annoy the Knight.\n\nTwo cousins and knights, Palamon and Arcite, are captured and imprisoned by Theseus, duke of Athens, after being found unconscious following his battle against Creon. Their cell is in the tower of Theseus' castle, with a window which overlooks his palace garden. The imprisoned Palamon wakes early one morning in May and catches sight of Princess Emily (Emelye), who is Theseus's sister-in-law, down in the courtyard picking flowers for a garland. He instantly falls in love with her; his moan is heard by Arcite, who then also wakes and sees Emily. He falls in love with her as well. This angers Palamon, who believes that he claimed her first. Arcite argues that he has the right to love Emily as well.\n\nThe friendship between Palamon and Arcite quickly deteriorates over their competition for Emily's love. After some years, Arcite is released from prison through the good offices of Perotheus, a mutual friend of Theseus's and Arcite's, amending Arcite's sentence down from imprisonment to exile; but Arcite then later secretly returns to Athens in disguise and enters service in Emily's household, to get close to her. Palamon eventually escapes by drugging the jailer, and, while hiding in a grove, overhears Arcite singing about love and fortune.\n\nThey begin to duel with each other over who should get Emily, but are thwarted by the arrival of Theseus. Theseus originally plans to sentence the two to death, but upon the protests of his wife and Emily, he decides to have them compete in a tournament instead. Palamon and Arcite are to gather 100 men apiece and to fight a mass judicial tournament, the winner of which is to marry Emily. The forces are assembled. On the night before the tournament, Palamon prays to Venus to make Emily his wife; Emily prays to Diana to remain unmarried, or else to marry the one who truly loves her; and Arcite prays to Mars for victory. Theseus lays down rules for the tournament so that if any man becomes seriously injured, he must be dragged out of the battle and is no longer in combat. Because of this, the story seems to claim at the end that there were almost no deaths on either side.\n\nAlthough both Palamon and Arcite fight valiantly, Palamon is wounded by a chance sword thrust from one of Arcite's men, and is unhorsed. Theseus declares the fight to be over. Arcite wins the battle, but following a divine intervention by Saturn, he is mortally wounded by his horse throwing him off and then falling on him before he can claim Emily as his prize. As he dies, he tells Emily that she should marry Palamon, because he would make a good husband for her. Palamon marries Emily, and thus all three prayers are fulfilled.\n\nThe First Mover or the Firste Moevere is a speech delivered by Theseus, spanning lines 2129–2216, bringing the poem's narrative to its close.\n\nThe First Mover appears near the end of the poem, after the protagonists Arcite and Palamon have finished their duel for Emily's hand; Arcite is slain, and Theseus speaks to console Emily and Palamon as they grieve for Arcite.\n\nTheseus begins with a reference to the First Mover, the \"primum movens\", or unmoved mover of Aristotelian philosophy creating the “Great Chain of Love”, the \"kyndely enclyning\", or natural inclination, that holds the universe together in Medieval cosmology. He describes the inevitability of death for all things at their proper time, using the destruction of an oak tree, a stone, and a river as examples, and listing all the classes of medieval society as universally subject to death. He then shifts to a discussion of the proper way to respond to this inevitability of death. Theseus maintains that, since every man must die when his time comes, that it is best to die with a good name and reputation, on good terms with his friends, and having died with honour. Theseus's comfort to Emily and Palamon is that Arcite died in just such a manner, having acquitted himself well in a feat of arms.\n\nIt is generally acknowledged among scholars that the First Mover speech draws on the philosophy of Boethius. What the purpose of the speech is, however, has been assessed variously. Some scholars maintain that the speech, with its Boethian elements, is not only representative of Boethian philosophy, but of Chaucer's own beliefs, and a reconciliation of Boethian and Christian philosophy, though this is disputed.\nThe speech has also been read as a parody of Boethius's \"Consolation of Philosophy\", as a narrative device simply conveying an idea from the Character of Theseus to the characters of Palamon and Emily, as a transition from a tragic character death to a happy ending, as a council of how and when to die properly, and even as an expression of disappointment in not only the events of the tournament, but in the divine order he describes.\n\nRichard Edwardes's 1566 play \"Palamon and Arcite\" is based on it, but the text of the play is lost. Another version of the story was performed in 1594, but this is only known from a reference in Philip Henslowe's diary. \"The Two Noble Kinsmen\", a 1613 play co-written by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, is based on the tale.\n\nJohn Dryden translated this story to a more modern language in the style of his time. Dryden's book is entitled \"Palamon and Arcite\" and is longer than the original text due to Dryden's own poetic touches.\n\nIn Alan Plater's 1975 TV series \"Trinity Tales\" the story is transformed into a competition between two young men for the attentions of a barmaid.\n\nThe story is one of the tales that inspired the 2001 movie \"A Knight's Tale\", in which Chaucer himself is one of the principal characters.\n\nAdapted for the BBC's Canterbury Tales in 2003, Palamon and Arcite were changed to Paul (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Ace (John Simm), and the story moved to a modern prison setting where the two men battle for the attentions of a prison teacher named Emily (Keeley Hawes).\n\n\n\n"}

His only problem seems to be an \"internal derangement of the knee\" but a mid-life crisis has struck and he is discovering angst. His familiar doses of cognitive therapy, aromatherapy, and acupuncture all offer no help, and he becomes obsessed with the philosophy of Kierkegaard. Moreover, Tubby, as Passmore is nicknamed, and referred to by several characters in the novel, undertakes a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in order to find his first love.\n\nThe novel is divided into four parts. The first part is written as a journal, the second part is written in dramatic monologues, the third part consists of journal entries and a memoir and the fourth part is a narrative written after the events happened and Tubby has returned to London.\n\nIn the first part, Tubby starts writing a journal triggered by a description he had to write for his cognitive behavior therapist. Before that Tubby wrote only screenplays but no narrative texts. During the writing Tubby reflects upon his problems and depression.\n\nThe dramatic monologues seem to present an outward look on Tubby but the reader finds out later that the monologues were written by Tubby himself which ruins the objectivity of this part. The reader cannot step out of Tubby's perspective but reads everything filtered through his eyes.\n\nIn the third part, the reader is presented the memoir about Maureen, Tubby's first love and his first girlfriend. It is by writing down their story that Tubby realizes what his problem is: he betrayed Maureen by dumping her in front of their friends.\n\nThe fourth part is written by Tubby looking backward on the events. He tells about his travel to Spain where he searched for Maureen on the Way of St. James. It is there, that Tubby comes to terms with his problems and finds peace.\n\nWhile writing his journal and looking up words and names, Tubby encounters the writings of Søren Kierkegaard. A list of Kierkegaard book titles catches his attention and motivates him to delve into Kierkegaard's journals and publications. Tubby feels that he and Kierkegaard have experienced similar difficulties. For example, Tubby likens his being mocked in a magazine article to Kierkegaard's Corsair Affair; and the way Tubby dumps Maureen, he feels, is akin to Kierkegaard's breakup with Regine. Tubby struggles to find a way out of his depression. Even though Tubby denies Christianity it may be interpreted that he undergoes the three (Kierkegaardian) existential stages of 'the Aesthetic', 'the Ethical' and 'the Religious' and takes leaps of faith to move from one stage to another.\n\n"}

Votes added by the magazine's readers are taken into consideration to recognize and give out the awards. Other annual features include the T+L 500, a list of the world's top 500 hotels, and America's Favorite Cities, where readers rank U.S. cities in different categories.\n\n\"Travel + Leisure\" magazine was purchased from American Express Publishing by Time Inc. (which would later be acquired by Meredith Corporation) on October 1, 2013.\n\nCurrent and defunct international editions:\n"}
{"id": "11368550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11368550", "title": "Wave model", "text": "Wave model\n\nIn historical linguistics, the wave model or wave theory (German \"Wellentheorie\") is a model of language change in which a new language feature (innovation) or a new combination of language features spreads from its region of origin, affecting a gradually expanding cluster of dialects. The theory was intended as a substitute for the tree model, which did not seem to be able to explain the existence of some features, especially in the Germanic languages, by descent from a proto-language. At its most ambitious, it is a wholesale replacement for the tree model of languages. During the 20th century, the wave model has had little acceptance as a model for language change overall, except for certain cases, such as the study of dialect continua and areal phenomena; it has recently gained more popularity among historical linguists, due to the shortcomings of the Tree model.\n\nThe tree model requires languages to evolve exclusively through social splitting and linguistic divergence. In the “tree” scenario, the adoption of certain innovations by a group of dialects should result immediately in their loss of contact with other related dialects: this is the only way to explain the nested organisation of subgroups imposed by the tree structure.\n\nSuch a requirement is absent from the Wave Model, which can easily accommodate a distribution of innovations in intersected patterns. Such a configuration is typical of dialect continua (and of linkages, see below), that is, historical situations in which dialects share innovations with different neighbours simultaneously, in such a way that the genealogical subgroups they define form an intersected pattern. This explains the popularity of the Wave model in studies of dialectology.\n\nJohannes Schmidt used a second metaphor to explain the formation of a language from a continuum. The continuum is at first like a smooth, sloping line. Speakers in close proximity tend to unify their speech, creating a stepped line out of the sloped line. These steps are the dialects. Over the course of time, some steps become weak and fall into disuse, while others preempt the entire continuum. As example Schmidt used Standard German, which was defined to conform to some dialects and then spread throughout Germany, replacing the local dialects in many cases.\n\nIn modern linguistics, the wave model has contributed greatly to improve, but not supersede, the tree model approach of the comparative method. Some scholars have even proposed that the wave model does not complement the tree model but should replace it for the representation of language genealogy. The recent works have also focused on the notion of a linkage, a family of languages descended from a former dialect continuum: Linkages cannot be represented by trees and must be analysed by the wave model.\n\nAdvocacy of the wave theory is attributed to Johannes Schmidt and Hugo Schuchardt.\n\nIn 2002 to 2007, Malcolm Ross and his colleagues theorized that Oceanic languages can be best understood as developing through the wave model.\n\n"}
