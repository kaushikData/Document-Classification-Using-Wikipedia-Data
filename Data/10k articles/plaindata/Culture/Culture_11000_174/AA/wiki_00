{"id": "57511274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57511274", "title": "A Summary History of New-England", "text": "A Summary History of New-England\n\nA Summary History of New-England is an 18th-century history book regarding New England by the American author, Hannah Adams. It was first published in Dedham, Massachusetts in 1799, by Herman Mann and James H. Adams, and followed her \"A View of Religions\", which was published in 1784. Not arrogating to herself the honors of an original historian, Adams exonerated herself from a large share of responsibility, and at the same time earned considerable merit by the judicious use which she has made of the labor of others. She included or abridged their accounts, as occasion demanded.\n\nIn \"A Summary History of New-England\", Adams presented a narrative more comprehensive than any previously written. It related to five of the oldest and populous states, and deduced their history leading to the period of the adoption of the federal government. The narrative was designed to be merely a summary, compiled from the collections of more laborious authors, and from fugitive or miscellaneous publications. A succinct, clear, comprehensive, and judicious view of the subject was the scope of the work, avoiding minute details and intricate inquiries. Upon publication, the \"Summary History\" was a desideratum, and its appearance satisfied the general expectation.\n\nAfter the publication of Adams' second edition of \"A View of Religions\" (1791), she taught school, boarding in the homes of the children. But it was not long before, inspired by her last literary venture, she determined to write another book. It was poverty, or, as she said, “desperation, not vanity,\" that first induced her to become an author or compiler of history. With a desire to help those who in early life had been deprived of reading much, if anything, of the history of their country, she began to write a history of New England. There was then no such history but Cotton Mather's \"Magnalia Christi Americana\", and Daniel Neal's \"History of New England\". \n\nHad there been one coming down to the acceptance of the Federal Constitution, her task would have been easier. As it was, she was obliged to spend much time among old state papers, ancient news prints, and old records in official places. The continued perusal of these so affected her eyes that a delay of two or three years in the appearance of the book, in 1799, after the research began, was a consequence.\n\nAdams made liberal use of the works of noted and popular writers on American affairs, but exercised the privilege of new modelling and abridging their accounts. She was praised for her selection of authorities, and in the use which she made of them. She manifested an accurate knowledge of her subject, an ardent love of liberty, and a \"masculine rećtitude of judgment\". \n\nThe history, divided into forty chapters, was published in an octave form, of about five hundred pages. The work commenced with an account of Christopher Columbus' discovery of America. It glanced at the political and ecclesiastical state of Great Britain immediately subsequent to the Reformation; at the persecution of nonconformists under the reigns of Elizabeth and James; and at the motives which impelled John Robinson and his band of adherents first to Leiden, and a part of them afterwards to Plymouth. It described the character of the Plymouth Colony settlers, their sufferings, government, manners, and religion. It treated of the theological tenets in which the continually-multiplying adventurers were, and in which they were not agreed; of their ambition to be governed by biblical laws; and of their love of liberty in England. The book contained a sketch of the American Revolutionary War, occupying nearly half of its pages. \n\nAdams published in 1805 \"An abridgement of the history of New-England, for the use of young persons\" (B. & J. Homans, and John West. A. Newell, printer; Boston). The later work retained the most important parts of the \"Summary History\". In twenty chapters, she comprised the substance of her first book. Long accounts of polemic divinity, which might not be read by the young, nor understood by the old, were omitted, and greatly abbreviated the story of the American Revolutionary War. She improved her work by means of later writers, and particularly by John Marshall's life of George Washington. The paragraphs were numbered, and the form and size of the book were well-suited to the use of children. It was said by Munroe & Francis (1895) that Adams possessed uncommon acuteness in discovering the repositories of knowledge adapted to her purpose, and a facility in using it.\n\nA second edition titled, \"An Abridgment of the History of New England, for the use of young persons. Now introduced into the principal schools of this town\", was published in Boston, in 1807.\n\nThe book was well-received in Europe and the United States.\n\nIn 1808, Jedidiah Morse and Elijah Parish published their \"A compendious history of New-England\". In it, they avoided reference to Adams' \"Summary History\", perhaps considering it to be \"too expensive and too disjointed to be useful\". \n\nIn 1809, Adams became a complainant and alleged an interference with her \"Summary History\" and its abridgment, by the \"Compendious History of New England\", which Drs. Morse and Parish published in two editions. Adams was represented in this submission by Stephen Higginson. After full deliberation on the evidence and observations presented to the referees (Thomas Dawes, John Davis, and Samuel Dexter), it was their opinion (Boston, 11 May 1809), that Drs. Morse and Parish, in making the publication complained of, had not violated any right, which any judicatory, legal or equitable, was competent to enforce. They were, however of opinion, that Adams, by her pre-occupation of the subject, and her assiduous and useful labors in the management of it, was entitled to attention and respect from gentlemen, contemplating a publication of like import, embracing the same period of time, and which, unless obviously defective, must necessarily exhibit strong features of resemblance to Adams' work. It was also stated that peculiar circumstances of Adams were also to be regarded, and seemed to require particular tenderness and attention, in any procedure, which might tend to diminish the profits of her literary labors. From a due estimation of these considerations, there should, the referees conceived, have resulted a conviction, that some amicable overtures were due to Adams, for satisfying her undefined claims, before a publication was made so similar to hers, and so likely to interfere with her reasonable expectations. The obligations should have restrained Drs. More and Parish from bringing their \"Compendious History\" into competition with Adams' \"Summary History\" and its Abridgment, without previous reasonable offers of compromise with her.\n\nIn 1867, Morse's son, Sidney, wrote:—\n\nThe 1895 review by Munroe & Francis of \"Compendious history\" stated that the authors had condescended to avail themselves of important information contained in Adams' work, which they were unable to readily obtain elsewhere. Of particular mention was their account of the settlement of Providence and Rhode Island, which they borrowed from Adams, and which was procured from old newspapers and rolls at the injurious expense of Adams' eyesight and health. It was duly noted that Morse & Parish gave no credit to Adams though they extracted entire sections from her \"Summary History\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "246497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246497", "title": "American folk music", "text": "American folk music\n\nThe term American folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as \"traditional music\", \"traditional folk music\", \"contemporary folk music\", or \"roots music\". Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as Great Britain, Europe, or Africa. Musician Mike Seeger once famously commented that the definition of American folk music is \"...all the music that fits between the cracks.\"\n\nRoots music is a broad category of music including bluegrass, gospel, old time music, jug bands, Appalachian folk, blues, Cajun and Native American music. The music is considered American either because it is native to the United States or because it developed there, out of foreign origins, to such a degree that it struck musicologists as something distinctly new. It is considered \"roots music\" because it served as the basis of music later developed in the United States, including rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and jazz.\n\nMost songs of the Colonial Fletch and Revolutionary period originated in England, Scotland and Ireland and were brought over by early settlers. \"Barbara Allen\" remains a popular traditional ballad originating in England and Scotland, which immigrants introduced to the United States. The murder ballad \"Pretty Polly\" is an American version of an earlier British song, \"The Gosport Tragedy\".\n\nAfrican American folk music in the area has roots in slavery and emancipation. \"Sacred music, both a Capella and instrumentally accompanied, is at the heart of the tradition. Early spirituals framed Christian beliefs within native practices and were heavily influenced by the music and rhythms of Africa.\" Spirituals are prominent, and often use a call and response pattern. \"Gospel developed after the Civil War (1861-65). It relied on biblical text for much of its direction, and the use of metaphors and imagery was common. Gospel is a \"joyful noise,\" sometimes accompanied by instrumentation and almost always punctuated by hand clapping, toe tapping, and body movement.\"\n\nSea shanties functioned to lighten the burden of routine tasks and provide a rhythm that helped workers perform as a team.\n\nCowboys songs are typically ballads that cowboys sang in the West and Southwest. The familiar Streets of Laredo\" (or \"Cowboys Lament\") derives from an Irish folk song of the late 18th century called \"The Unfortunate Rake\", which in turn appears to have descended from the even earlier \"The Bard of Armagh\". While \"Streets of Laredo\" uses the same melody as \"The Unfortunate Rake\", \"St. James Infirmary Blues\" adapts the story to a different tune. This illustrates how folk songs can change in the retelling and appear in a variety of versions.\n\nThe \"Ballad of John Henry (folklore)\" is about an African-American folk hero said to have worked as a \"steel-driving man\".\n\nMany roots musicians do not consider themselves folk musicians. The main difference between the American folk music revival and American \"roots music\" is that roots music seems to cover a broader range, including blues and country.\n\nRoots music developed its most expressive and varied forms in the first three decades of the 20th century. The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl were extremely important in disseminating these musical styles to the rest of the country, as Delta blues masters, itinerant honky tonk singers, Cajun musicians spread to cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York. The growth of the recording industry in the same period was also important; higher potential profits from music placed pressure on artists, songwriters, and label executives to replicate previous hit songs. This meant that musical fads, such as Hawaiian slack-key guitar, never died out completely, since a broad range of rhythms, instruments, and vocal stylings were incorporated into disparate popular genres.\n\nBy the 1950s, forms of roots music had led to pop-oriented forms. Folk musicians like the Kingston Trio, blues-derived rock and roll and rockabilly, pop-gospel, doo wop and R&B (later secularized further as soul music) and the Nashville sound in country music all modernized and expanded the musical palette of the country.\n\nThe roots approach to music emphasizes the diversity of American musical traditions, the genealogy of creative lineages and communities, and the innovative contributions of musicians working in these traditions today. In recent years roots music has been the focus of popular media programs such as Garrison Keillor's public radio program, \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and the feature film by the same name.\n\nAmerican traditional music is also called roots music. Roots music is a broad category of music including bluegrass, country music, gospel, old time music, jug bands, Appalachian folk, blues, Cajun and Native American music. The music is considered American either because it is native to the United States or because it developed there, out of foreign origins, to such a degree that it struck musicologists as something distinctly new. It is considered \"roots music\" because it served as the basis of music later developed in the United States, including rock and roll, contemporary folk music, rhythm and blues, and jazz.\n\nAppalachian music is the traditional music of the region of Appalachia in the Eastern United States. It derives from various European and African influences—including English ballads, Irish and Scottish traditional music (especially fiddle music), hymns, and African-American blues. First recorded in the 1920s, Appalachian musicians were a key influence on the early development of Old-time music, country music, and bluegrass, and were an important part of the American folk music revival.\n\nInstruments typically used to perform Appalachian music include the banjo, American fiddle, fretted dulcimer, and guitar.\n\nEarly recorded Appalachian musicians include Fiddlin' John Carson, Henry Whitter, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, the Carter Family, Clarence Ashley, Frank Proffitt, and Dock Boggs, all of whom were initially recorded in the 1920s and 1930s. Several Appalachian musicians obtained renown during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, including Jean Ritchie, Roscoe Holcomb, Ola Belle Reed, Lily May Ledford, and Doc Watson.\n\nThe Carter Family was a traditional American folk music group that recorded between 1927 and 1956. Their music had a profound impact on bluegrass, country, Southern Gospel, pop and rock musicians. They were the first vocal group to become country music stars; a beginning of the divergence of country music from traditional folk music. Their recordings of such songs as \"Wabash Cannonball\" (1932), \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\" (1935), \"Wildwood Flower\" (1928), and \"Keep on the Sunny Side\" (1928) made them country standards.\n\nCountry and bluegrass artists such as Loretta Lynn, Roy Acuff, Dolly Parton, Earl Scruggs, Chet Atkins, and Don Reno were heavily influenced by traditional Appalachian music. Artists such as Bob Dylan, Jerry Garcia, and Bruce Springsteen have performed Appalachian songs or rewritten versions of Appalachian songs.\n\nCajun music, an emblematic music of Louisiana, is rooted in the ballads of the French-speaking Acadians of Canada. Cajun music is often mentioned in tandem with the Creole-based, Cajun-influenced zydeco form, both of Acadiana origin. These French Louisiana sounds have influenced American popular music for many decades, especially country music, and have influenced pop culture through mass media, such as television commercials.\n\nBefore recorded history American Indians in this area used songs and instrumentation; music and dance remain the core of ceremonial and social activities. \"Stomp dance\" remains at its core, a \"call and response\" form; instrumentation is provided by rattles or shackles worn on the legs of women. \"Other southeastern nations have their own complexes of sacred and social songs, including those for animal dances and friendship dances, and songs that accompany stickball games.\n\nCentral to the music of the southern Plains Indians is the drum, which has been called the heartbeat of Plains Indian music. Most of that genre traces back to the hunting and warfare that was a strong part of plains culture. During the reservation period, they frequently used music to relieve boredom and despair. Neighbors gathered, exchanged and created songs and dances. This is a part of the roots of the modern intertribal powwow. Another common instrument is the courting flute.\n\nShape-note or sacred harp singing developed in the early nineteenth century as a way for itinerant singing instructors to teach church songs in rural communities. They taught using song books that represented musical notation of tones by geometric shapes that associated a shape with a pitch. Sacred harp singing became popular in many Oklahoma rural communities, regardless of ethnicity.\n\nLater, the blues tradition developed, with roots in and parallels to sacred music. By the early 20th century, jazz developed, born from a \"blend of ragtime, gospel, and blues\" \"Anglo-Scots-Irish music traditions gained a place in Oklahoma after the Land Run of 1889. Because of its size and portability, the fiddle was the core of early Oklahoma Anglo music, but other instruments such as the guitar, mandolin, banjo, and steel guitar were added later. Various Oklahoma music traditions trace their roots to the British Isles, including cowboy ballads, western swing, and contemporary country and western.\" \"Mexican immigrants began to reach Oklahoma in the 1870s, bringing beautiful canciones and corridos love songs, waltzes, and ballads along with them. Like American Indian communities, each rite of passage in Hispanic communities is accompanied by traditional music.\n\nThe acoustic guitar, string bass, and violin provide the basic instrumentation for Mexican music, with maracas, flute, horns, or sometimes accordion filling out the sound.\" Other Europeans (such as Bohemians and Germans) settled in the late nineteenth century. Their social activities centered on community halls, \"where local musicians played polkas and waltzes on the accordion, piano, and brass instruments.\"\n\nLater Asians contributed to the musical mix. \"Ancient music and dance traditions from the temples and courts of China, India, and Indonesia are preserved in Asian communities throughout the state, and popular song genres are continually layered on to these classical music forms\"\n\nTejano and New Mexico music, heard throughout the American Southwest and South Texas, is rooted in the musics of the Native American and Hispanic/Latino communities of the regions. Tejano music is also heavily influenced by Regional Mexican and Country music, while New Mexico music is much more influenced by Hispano folk and Western music. Both styles have influenced one another over the years, and incorporated American popular music styles.\n\nGenres here range as widely as the definition of folk music itself; working definitions are based on the style and themes of the music regardless of its source. Many are a part of the American Folk Music Revival, including works by Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, The Weavers, Burl Ives, and others. A more commercially oriented pop music version of folk emerged in the 1960s, including performers such as The Kingston Trio, The Limeliters, The Brothers Four, Peter, Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, The Highwaymen, Judy Collins, The New Christy Minstrels, and Gordon Lightfoot, as well as counterculture and folk rock performers including Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Arlo Guthrie, and Buffy Sainte-Marie. Folk composer and musician Robert Schmertz composed and wrote pieces related to historical events in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2004, NPR published the book titled \"The NPR Curious Listener's Guide to American Folk Music\", Linda Ronstadt wrote the foreword.\n\nIn 2007, James P. Leary published \"Polkabilly: How the Goose Island Ramblers Redefined American Folk Music\", which proposes a redefinition of traditional American folk music and identifies a new genre of music from the Upper Midwest known as \"Polkabilly\", which blends ethnic music, old-time country music, and polka. The book was awarded the American Folklore Society’s Chicago Folklore Prize for the best book in the field of folklore scholarship.\n\nNotable American folk/roots musicians include:\nGroups:\n\n\"Hootenanny\", a weekly musical variety show broadcast on the ABC network in the U.S. in 1963-1964, primarily featured folk musicians.\n\nThe soundtrack of the 2000 film \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" is exclusively roots music, performed by Alison Krauss, The Fairfield Four, Emmylou Harris, Norman Blake and others.\n\nIn 2001, PBS broadcast a 4-part documentary series, \"American Roots Music,\" that explored the historical roots of American roots music through footage and performances by the creators of the movement.\n\nThe 2003 film \"A Mighty Wind\" is a tribute to (and parody of) the folk-pop musicians of the early 1960s.\n\nA six-hour public television series, \"The Music of America: History Through Musical Traditions,\" appeared in 2010.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5356681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5356681", "title": "Anti-Iranian sentiment", "text": "Anti-Iranian sentiment\n\nAnti-Iranian sentiment also known as Anti-Persian sentiment, Persophobia, or Iranophobia refers to feelings and expression of hostility, hatred, discrimination, or prejudice towards Iran (Persia) and its culture, and towards persons based on their association with Iran and Iranian culture. Its opposite is Persophilia.\n\nHistorically, prejudice against Iranians (more specifically ethnic Persians) was prominent in the Arab World, particularly on the part of some Arabs following the Arab invasion of Iran.\n\nThe word \"ʻajam\" is derived from the root ʻ-J-M and refers to \"unclear, vague and/or incomprehensible\" as opposed to \"ʻarabi\", which means \"clear, understandable; with perfect Arabic tongue\". ʻAjam came to mean \"one who mumbles\" (کند زبانان), similar to the Slavic ethnonym and their usage of \"mutes\" to refer to Germans. It came to be \"applied especially to Persians\", and the distinction of the two terms is found already in pre- and early Islamic literature (ʻAjam Temtemī). \"In general, \"ajam\" was a pejorative term, used by Arabs because of their contrived social and political superiority in early Islam.\", as summarized by Clifford Bosworth. Although Arabic dictionaries state that the word ʻajami is used for all \"non-Arabs\", the designation was primarily used for Persians.\n\nSunni Arabs use slurs against Persians by calling them \"fire worshipers\" and \"majoos\", \"majus\" (ماجوس) which means Zoroastrians, Magi.\n\nPatrick Clawson states that \"The Iranians chafed under Umayyad rule. The Umayyads rose from traditional Arab aristocracy. They tended to marry other Arabs, creating an ethnic stratification that discriminated against Iranians. Even as Arabs adopted traditional Iranian bureaucracy, Arab tribalism disadvantaged Iranians.\"\n\nMany Arab Muslims believed that Iranian converts should not clothe themselves as Arabs, among many other forms discrimination that existed.\nMu'awiyah, in a famous letter addressed to Ziyad ibn Abih, the then governor of Iraq, wrote:\n\nMistreatment of Iranians and other non-Arabs during the early period of Islam is well documented. Under the rule of Umayyads, although many of the \"mawlas\" (non-Arab Muslims) employed by a patron enjoyed favourable position as equal to an Arab Muslim, they were generally victims of cultural bias and even sometimes considered to be of an equal footing of a slave. According to sources of that time, the mistreatment of mawlas was a general rule. They were denied any positions in the government under Umayyad rule.\n\nThe Umayyid Arabs are even reported to have prevented the mawali from having \"kunyahs\", as an Arab was only considered worthy of a \"kunya\". They were required to pay taxes for not being an Arab:\n\nZarrinkoub presents a lengthy discussion on the large flux and influence of the victorious Arabs on the literature, language, culture and society of Persia during the two centuries following the Islamic conquest of Persia in his book \"Two Centuries of Silence\".\n\nAfter the Islamic conquest of the Sassanid Empire, during the reign of the Ummayad dynasty, the Arab conquerors imposed Arabic as the primary language of the subject peoples throughout their empire. Not happy with the prevalence of the Iranian languages in the divan, Hajjāj ibn Yusuf ordered the official language of the conquered lands to be replaced by Arabic, sometimes by force. According to Biruni\n\nIt is difficult to imagine the Arabs not implementing anti-Persian policies in light of such events, writes Zarrinkoub in his famous \"Two Centuries of Silence\", where he exclusively writes of this topic. Reports of Persian speakers being tortured are also given in al-Aghānī.\n\nPredominantly Shia Islamic Iran has always exhibited a sympathetic side for Ali (the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad) and his progeny. Even when Persia was largely Sunni, this was still evident as can be seen from the writings remaining from that era. Rumi for example praises Ali in a section entitled \"Learn from ʻAli\". It recounts Ali's explanation as to why he declined to kill someone who had spit in his face as ʻAli was defeating him in battle. Persian literature in praise of Ali's progeny is quite ubiquitous and abundant. These all stem from numerous traditions regarding Ali's favor of Persians being as equals to Arabs.\n\nSeveral early Shiite sources speak of a dispute arising between an Arab and an Iranian woman. Referring the case to ʻAli for arbitration, ʻAli reportedly did not allow any discrimination between the two to take place. His judgment thus invited the protest of the Arab woman. Thereupon, ʻAli replied, \"In the Qurʼan, I did not find the progeny of Ishmael (the Arabs) to be any higher than the Iranians.\"\n\nIn another such tradition, Ali was once reciting a sermon in the city of Kufah, when Ash'as ibn Qays, a commander in the Arab army protested, \"Amir-al-Momeneen! These Iranians are excelling the Arabs right in front of your eyes and you are doing nothing about it!\" He then roared, \"I will show them who the Arabs are!\" Ali immediately retorted, \"While fat Arabs rest in soft beds, the Iranians work hard on the hottest days to please God with their efforts. And what do these Arabs want from me? To ostracize the Iranians and become an oppressor! I swear by the God that splits the nucleus and creates Man, I heard the prophet once say, just as you strike the Iranians with your swords in the name of Islam, so will the Iranians one day strike you back the same way for Islam.\"\n\nWhen the Sassanid city of Anbar fell to the forces of Mu'awiyeh, news reached Ali that the city had been sacked and plundered spilling much innocent blood. Early Shi'ite sources report that Ali gathered all the people of Kufa to the mosque and gave a fiery sermon. After describing the massacre, he said, \"If somebody hearing this news now faints and dies of grief, I fully approve of it!\" It is from here that Ali is said to have had more sympathy for Iranians while author S. Nureddin Abtahi claims that Umar highly resented them. However, a hadith on Ali's banning of the game of shatranj (chess), narrates that Ali said \"Chess is the gambling game of the Ajam\"\n\nIt was in Baghdad where the first Arab nationalists, mainly of Palestinian and Syrian descent, formed the basis of their overall philosophies. Prominent among them were individuals such as Mohammad Amin al-Husayni (the Mufti of Jerusalem) and Syrian nationalists such as Shukri al-Quwatli and Jamil Mardam. Sati' al-Husri, who served as advisor to the Ministry of Education and later as Director General of Education and Dean of the College of Law, was particularly instrumental in shaping the Iraqi educational system. Other prominent Pan-Arabists were Michel Aflaq and Khairallah Talfah, as well as Sati' al-Husri, Salah al-Din al-Bitar, Zaki al-Arsuzi and Sami Shwkat (brother of Naji Shawkat). These individuals formed the nucleus and genesis of true pan-Arabism.\n\nSati' al-Husri's campaigns against schools suspected of being positive towards Persia are well documented. One dramatic example is found in the 1920s when the Iraqi Ministry of Education ordered Husri to appoint Muhammad Al-Jawahiri as a teacher in a Baghdad school. A short excerpt of Husri's interview with the teacher is revealing:\n\nSaddam Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti forced out tens of thousands of people of Persian origin from Iraq in the 1970s, after having been accused of being spies for Iran and Israel. Today, many of them live in Iran.\n\nEarly on in his career, Saddam Hussein and pan-Arab ideologues targeted the Arabs of southwest Iran in an endeavour to have them separate and join 'the Arab nation.' Hussein made no effort to conceal Arab nationalism in his war against Iran (which he called \"the second Battle of al-Qādisiyyah). An intense campaign of propaganda during his reign meant that many school children were taught that Iran provoked Iraq into invading and that the invasion was fully justified.\n\n\"Yellow revolution\", \"yellow wind\", \"yellow storm\" were thrown as slurs by Saddam Hussein against Iran due to Hulagu's 1258 sack of Baghdad during the Mongol wars and the terms \"Persian\" and \"Elamites\" were also used by Saddam as insults.\n\nOn 2 April 1980, a half-year before the outbreak of the war, Saddam Hussein visited Al-Mustansiriya University in Baghdad. By drawing parallels to the 7th-Century defeat of Persia in the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah, he announced:\n\nSaddam also accused Iranians of \"murdering the second (Umar), third (Uthman) and fourth (Ali) Caliphs of Islam\", invading the three islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs in the Persian Gulf and attempting to destroy the Arabic language and civilization.\n\nIn the war, Iraq made extensive use of chemical weapons (such as mustard gas) against Iranian troops and civilians as well as Iraqi Kurds. Iran expected a condemnation by UN of this act and sent allegation to UN. At time (-1985) the UN Security Council issued statements that \"chemical weapons had been used in the war.\" However, in these UN-statements Iraq was not mentioned by name, so that the situation is viewed as \"in a way, the international community remained silent as Iraq used weapons of mass destruction against Iranian as well as Iraqi Kurds\" and it is believed that the United States had prevented UN from condemning Iraq.\n\nIn December 2006, Hussein said he would take responsibility \"with honour\" for any attacks on Iran using conventional or chemical weapons during the 1980–1988 war, but he took issue with charges he ordered attacks on Iraqis.\n\nOn the execution day, Hussein said, \"I spent my whole life fighting the infidels and the intruders, [...] I destroyed the invaders and the Persians.\" He also stressed that the Iraqis should fight the Americans and the Persians. Mowaffak al Rubiae, Iraq's National Security adviser, who was a witness to Hussein's execution described him as repeatedly shouting \"down with Persians.\" Hussein built an anti-Iranian monument called Hands of Victory in Baghdad in 1989 to commemorate his declaration of victory over Iran in the Iran-Iraq war (though the war is generally considered a stalemate). After his fall, it was reported that the new Iraqi government had organized the Committee for Removing Symbols of the Saddam Era and that the Hands of Victory monument had begun to be dismantled. However, the demolition was later halted.\n\n\"Al-Salafi\" magazine, quoted in \"The Times\", states, \"Iran has become more dangerous than Israel itself. The Iranian Revolution has come to renew the Persian presence in the region. This is the real clash of civilizations.\"\n\nIn response to the anti-Arab remarks from Iran's supreme leader when he accused Arab authorities of killing Muslims, Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh, Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, stated in 2016 that Iranian leaders are descendants of Zoroastrians and are \"not Muslims.\"\n\nAl-Qaeda has been increasingly singling out Iran and Shiites, describing the \"Persians\" as the enemy of Arabs and complicit in the occupation of Iraq.\n\nAccording to the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans (PAAIA), nearly half of Iranian Americans surveyed in 2008 by Zogby International have themselves experienced or personally know another Iranian American who has experienced discrimination because of their ethnicity or country of origin. The most common types of discrimination reported are airport security, social discrimination, employment or business discrimination, racial profiling and discrimination at the hands of immigration officials.\n\nThe Iranian hostage crisis of the US embassy in Tehran in November 1979 precipitated a wave of anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States, against the new Islamic regime and Iranian nationals and immigrants. Even though such sentiments gradually declined after the release of the hostages at the start of 1981. In response, some Iranian immigrants to the US have distanced themselves from their nationality and instead identify primarily on the basis of their ethnic or religious affiliations.\n\nSince the 1980s and especially since the 1990s, Hollywood's depiction of Iranians has vilified Iranians as in television programs such as \"24\", \"John Doe\", \"On Wings of Eagles\" (1986), and \"\" (1981), which was based on a true story. Critics maintain that Hollywood's \"tall walls of exclusion and discrimination have yet to crumble when it comes to the movie industry's persistent misrepresentation of Iranians and their collective identity\".\n\nThe 1991 film \"Not Without My Daughter\" was criticized for its portrayal of Iranian society. Filmed in Israel, it was based on the autobiography by Betty Mahmoody. In the book and film, an American woman (Mahmoody) traveled to Tehran with her young daughter to visit her Iranian-born family of her husband. Mahmoody's husband then undergoes a strange transformation in Iran, ranging from an educated and sophisticated citizen to an abusive, backwards peasant, eventually deciding that they will not return to the United States. Betty is told that she can divorce him and leave, but their daughter must stay in Tehran under Islamic law. Ultimately, after 18 months in Iran, Betty and her daughter escape to the American embassy in Turkey.\n\nSeveral Western critics, including Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun Times\" and Caryn James of \"The New York Times\", criticized the film for stereotyping Iranians as misogynistic and fanatical. According to Ebert, the film depicts Islamic society \"in shrill terms\", where women are \"willing or unwilling captives of their men\", deprived of \"what in the West would be considered basic human rights\". Furthermore, Ebert says, \"No attempt is made—deliberately, I assume—to explain the Muslim point of view, except in rigid sets of commands and rote statements\". Ebert then contends, \"If a movie of such a vitriolic and spiteful nature were to be made in America about any other ethnic group, it would be denounced as racist and prejudiced.\"\n\nAccording to Jane Campbell, the film \"only serves to reinforce the media stereotype of Iranians as terrorists who, if not actively bombing public buildings or holding airline passengers hostage, are untrustworthy, irrational, cruel, and barbaric.\"\n\nThe film was also criticized in Iran. A 2002 Islamic Republic News Agency article claimed that the film \"[made] smears...against Iran\" and \"stereotyped Iranians as cruel characters and wife-beaters\". In a Finnish documentary, \"Without My Daughter\", film maker Alexis Kouros tells Mahmoody's husband's side of the story, showing Iranian eyewitnesses accusing the Hollywood film of spreading lies and \"treasons\". Alice Sharif, an American woman living with her Iranian husband in Tehran, accuses Mahmoody and the filmmakers of deliberately attempting to foment anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.\n\nThe 2004 film \"Alexander\" by American director Oliver Stone has been accused of negative and inaccurate portrayal of Persians.\n\nThe 2007 film \"300\", an adaptation of Frank Miller's 1998 graphic novel, was criticized for its racist portrayal of combatants in the Persian army at the Battle of Thermopylae. Reviewers in the United States and elsewhere \"noted the political overtones of the West-against-Iran story line and the way Persians are depicted as decadent, sexually flamboyant and evil in contrast to the noble Greeks\". With bootleg versions of the film already available in Tehran with the film's international release and news of the film's surprising success at the U.S. box office, it prompted widespread anger in Iran. Azadeh Moaveni of \"Time\" reported, \"All of Tehran was outraged. Everywhere I went yesterday, the talk vibrated with indignation over the film\". Newspapers in Iran featured headlines such as \"Hollywood declares war on Iranians\" and \"300 AGAINST 70 MILLION\" (Iran's population). \"Ayende-No\", an independent Iranian newspaper, said that \"[t]he film depicts Iranians as demons, without culture, feeling or humanity, who think of nothing except attacking other nations and killing people\". Four Iranian Members of Parliament have called for Muslim countries to ban the film, and a group of Iranian film makers submitted a letter of protest to UNESCO regarding the film's alleged misrepresentation of Iranian history and culture. Iran's cultural advisor to president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has called the film an \"American attempt for psychological warfare against Iran\".\n\nMoaveni identified two factors which may have contributed to the intensity of Iranian indignation over the film. First, she describes the timing of the film's release, on the eve of Norouz, the Persian New Year, as \"inauspicious.\" Second, Iranians tend to view the era depicted in the film as \"a particularly noble page in their history\". Moaveni also suggests that \"the box office success of \"300\", compared with the relative flop of \"Alexander\" (another spurious period epic dealing with Persians), is cause for considerable alarm, signaling ominous U.S. intentions\".\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", Iranian critics of \"300\", ranging from bloggers to government officials, have described the movie \"as a calculated attempt to demonise Iran at a time of intensifying U.S. pressure over the country's nuclear programme\". An Iranian government spokesman described the film as \"hostile behavior which is the result of cultural and psychological warfare\". Moaveni reported that the Iranians she interacted with were \"adamant that the movie was secretly funded by the U.S. government to prepare Americans for going to war against Iran\".\n\nDana Stevens of Slate states, \"If \"300\", the new battle epic based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley, had been made in Germany in the mid-1930s, it would be studied today alongside \"The Eternal Jew\" as a textbook example of how race-baiting fantasy and nationalist myth can serve as an incitement to total war. Since it is a product of the post-ideological, post-Xbox 21st century, \"300\" will instead be talked about as a technical achievement, the next blip on the increasingly blurry line between movies and video games.\n\nThe requests of the Ministry of Education and Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands to monitor Iranian students has led to a situation that Iranian students cannot study at the University of Twente in the city of Enschede and Eindhoven University of Technology in the city of Eindhoven. The latter university had even asked the AIVD, the Dutch intelligence service, to monitor Iranian students. AIVD stated that it was not its duty to do so, and the University has decided to stop admitting any applicants from Iran, regardless of the degree sought. The Dutch government says that if fears the theft of sensitive nuclear technology that could assist the Iranian government in constructing nuclear weapons. After protests were lodged, the Dutch government announced again that Iranian students and the Dutch citizens of Iranian heritage are not allowed to study at many Dutch universities or go to some areas in the Netherlands.\n\nAdditionally, several other universities stated that the government had prohibited them from admitting students from Iran, and technical colleges were not allowed to give Iranian students access to knowledge of nuclear technology. It was noted that it was the first time after the German occupation during the Second World War that ethnic-, religion- or racial-based restrictions were imposed in the Netherlands. Harry van Bommel, a parliamentarian of the Dutch Socialist Party (SP), condemned the \"berufsverbot\", deliberately using a German word associated with the Second World War.\n\nAlthough the Dutch authorities state that the UN security council's resolution 1737 (2006) authorises them and obliges all member states of the UN to take such a measure, it remains the only country to have done so.\n\nOn 3 February 2010, a court in the Hague ruled that the Dutch government's policy to ban Iranian-born students and scientists from certain master's degrees and from nuclear research facilities is overly broad and a violation of an international civil rights treaty.\n\nAccording to a 2013 survey 75% of Turks look at Iran unfavorably against 14% with favorable views. Political scientist Shireen Hunter writes that there are two significant groups in Turkey that are hostile towards Iran: \"the military establishment and the ultra-Kemalist elite\" and the \"ultranationalists with pan-Turkist aspirations\" (such as the Grey Wolves). Canadian author Kaveh Farrokh also suggests that pan-Turkist groups (the Grey Wolves in particular) have encouraged anti-Iranian sentiments.\n\nHistorically, the Shia Muslims were discriminated in the Ottoman Empire as they were associated with their Iranian/Persian neighbors. In Turkey, relatively large communities of Turks, Kurds and Zazas are Alevi Shia, while some areas in Eastern Anatolia, notably Kars and Ağrı, are Twelver Shia.\n\nAccording to political adviser Eldar Mamedov, \"Anti-Iranian policies [have been] carried out by various Azerbaijani governments since the 1990s.\" Azerbaijan's second President Abulfaz Elchibey (1992–93) and his government has been widely described as pursuing Pan-Turkic and anti-Iranian policies.\n\nAccording to a July 2007 poll in Armenia, Iran is viewed largely as an important partner (23%), rather than a political and economic threat (8%). According to a 2013 poll, the overwhelming majority of respondents opposed women marrying Iranians (89% vs 10% approving). In contrast, a slight majority approved doing business with Iranians (52% vs 46%).\n\n<div style=\"font-size: 90%\">\n</div style=\"font-size: 90%\">\n\n\n"}

His accomplice, 16-year-old Fred Barras, was fatally shot by Martin in his remote farmhouse in Emneth Hungate, Norfolk. Fearon, aged 29 at the time, was hospitalised with gunshot wounds to his legs after being shot by Martin in the same house.\n\nFearon, a career criminal and Irish traveller, had been convicted at that point of about thirty offences, starting with handling stolen goods in September 1986, for which he was fined £25, through theft, burglary, drugs, fraud and wounding, for which he received a one-year prison sentence, his third and at the time longest custodial sentence, in May 1997.\n\nOther crimes included obtaining property by deception, criminal damage, failing to surrender to bail, attempted burglary, and theft from a vehicle.\n\nFearon had planned to burgle Bleak House, belonging to Tony Martin, after he had heard fellow Irish travellers talking in a Newark pub two months earlier about the farm, which had been burgled several times. On 20 August, Fearon persuaded Darren Bark (then 33 years old), also from Newark-on-Trent, to drive Fred Barras and himself to the farm. Bark stayed in the car waiting in a lane, while Fearon and Barras entered the farmhouse. When confronted they attempted to flee through a window but were shot by Martin; Fearon in the leg and Barras in the back. Barras died at the site, but Fearon managed to escape and obtain medical assistance from a couple in a cottage nearby. Martin subsequently left the farm and spent the night at a friend's house. \n\nOn 10 January 2000 Fearon and Bark admitted to conspiring to burgle Martin's farmhouse. Fearon was sentenced to three years in prison and Bark to 30 months (with an additional 12 months arising from previous offences). Fearon was released on 10 August 2001.\n\nIn April of the same year Martin was convicted of murdering Barras, the charge was reduced in 2001 to manslaughter, the sentence to 5 years, on appeal, due to diminished responsibility. Fearon was released after eighteen months, Martin after about three years, having been refused early parole.\n\nDuring 2003, Fearon applied for, and received, an estimated £5,000 of legal aid to sue Martin for loss of earnings due to the injury he sustained. However, the case was thrown into doubt when photographs of Fearon cycling were published in \"The Sun\" showing Fearon's injuries were not as serious as had been claimed. Fearon later dropped the case when Martin agreed to drop a counter-claim.\n\nIn March 2005, the BBC was criticised for making a monetary payment, widely reported to be £4,500, to Fearon in return for an interview. The interview and information thus gathered was intended for a documentary being made about the case. The payment was justified by the BBC on the basis that Fearon was the only person who could provide specific information on what happened during the Tony Martin break-in. John Humphrys, while conducting an interview, pointed out on the \"Today\" programme that the Fearon's testimony was a matter of public record while Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the Lord Chancellor, described the BBC payment as a \"disgusting warping of our values\". Brendon Fearon was also approached to appear in an episode of \"Real Crime\" (\"A Shot in the Dark\") shown on ITV in 2008. As in 2005 he demanded a fee but this time his request was declined and he did not appear.\n\nFearon was again jailed for 18 months on 6 February 2003 for dealing in heroin. Controversy was again provoked, in July 2003 when Fearon left Ranby prison after serving less than a third of his 18-month sentence - just days before Martin's release. The Home Secretary, David Blunkett requested an explanation from the head of the prison service.\n\nOn 2 September 2003 Fearon was arrested for taking a Toyota Land Cruiser on 24 August without the owner's consent. On 9 November 2003, he was found guilty of driving the vehicle without insurance and recalled to prison to serve the remainder of the preceding sentence.\n\nIn August 2005 Fearon was arrested with Dean Thompson, accused of drawing out £11,000 from a bank machine using stolen cash cards. Fearon was bailed to appear before magistrates in October.\n\nIn February 2006, Fearon was banned from two public houses in Newark. The Crown Court Judge called Fearon \"a menace\" and issued him with an 18-month community order for his part in causing a large disorder occurring at the said locations.\n"}
{"id": "2596218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2596218", "title": "Chickenlover", "text": "Chickenlover\n\n\"Chickenlover\" is the third episode of the second season of the American animated television series \"South Park\". The 16th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on May 20, 1998. The episode was written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with David R. Goodman, and directed by Parker. In the episode, Officer Barbrady resigns as South Park's only police officer because of his illiteracy. Anarchy ensues, just as chickens are mysteriously being molested across South Park. Barbrady enlists the help of the boys to learn to read and discover who is molesting the chickens. Cartman, meanwhile, masquerades as a police officer.\n\nStan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman visit the \"Booktastic Bus\", a mobile library. They are initially intrigued, but become uninterested in reading after meeting the strange driver. Word spreads that a pervert is molesting chickens in town. When Officer Barbrady starts the investigation, he is confronted with his illiteracy. He resigns in shame and anarchy immediately breaks out. Later, he is put into the boys' class to learn to read.\n\nBarbrady recruits the boys to help him with his task, showing his knowledge of the police code. From then on, Cartman patrols the town on his Big Wheel, enforcing his own brand of justice. The molester is finally caught in the petting zoo and turns out to be the bookmobile driver. He plotted this all along to encourage Barbrady to learn to read. After being given a copy of Ayn Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged\", Barbrady knocks down the man with a club to the head to teach Cartman how to properly deal with criminals. The town holds a parade for Barbrady, and when he is asked to give a speech, he reveals how \"Atlas Shrugged\" convinced him to never read again.\n\nOriginally, Cartman was supposed to receive a gun during his stint as a deputy police officer, but Comedy Central's censors were reluctant to show a child with a firearm. The season one episode \"Volcano\" depicted children wielding firearms, but it was allowed then as the usage was considered less controversial by Comedy Central. The episode was originally titled \"Chickenfucker\", but it was changed as Comedy Central did not want any profane wording in any of its titles.\n\n\"Chickenlover\" was originally broadcast on Comedy Central in the United States on May 27, 1998. The second season of the show started in April 1998, with two episodes. Then, on May 20, the episode \"Ike's Wee Wee\" started a six-episode run of the season.\n\nAll 18 episodes of the second season, including \"Chickenlover\", were released on a DVD box set on June 3, 2003.\n\n"}
{"id": "5703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5703", "title": "Cyberpunk", "text": "Cyberpunk\n\nCyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a futuristic setting that tends to focus on a \"combination of lowlife and high tech\" featuring advanced technological and scientific achievements, such as artificial intelligence and cybernetics, juxtaposed with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the social order.\n\nMuch of cyberpunk is rooted in the New Wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when writers like Philip K. Dick, Roger Zelazny, J. G. Ballard, Philip José Farmer and Harlan Ellison examined the impact of drug culture, technology and the sexual revolution while avoiding the utopian tendencies of earlier science fiction. Released in 1984, William Gibson's influential debut novel \"Neuromancer\" would help solidify cyberpunk as a genre, drawing influence from punk subculture and early hacker culture. Other influential cyberpunk writers included Bruce Sterling and Rudy Rucker. The Japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of Katsuhiro Otomo's manga series \"Akira\", with its 1988 anime film adaptation later popularizing the subgenre.\n\nEarly films in the genre include Ridley Scott's 1982 film \"Blade Runner\", one of several of Philip K. Dick's works that have been adapted into films. The films \"Johnny Mnemonic\" and \"New Rose Hotel\", both based upon short stories by William Gibson, flopped commercially and critically. More recent additions to this genre of filmmaking include the 2017 release of \"Blade Runner 2049\", sequel to the original 1982 film, and the 2018 Netflix TV series \"Altered Carbon\".\n\nLawrence Person has attempted to define the content and ethos of the cyberpunk literary movement stating: \nCyberpunk plots often center on conflict among artificial intelligences, hackers, and megacorporations, and tend to be set in a near-future Earth, rather than in the far-future settings or galactic vistas found in novels such as Isaac Asimov's \"Foundation\" or Frank Herbert's \"Dune\". The settings are usually post-industrial dystopias but tend to feature extraordinary cultural ferment and the use of technology in ways never anticipated by its original inventors (\"the street finds its own uses for things\"). Much of the genre's atmosphere echoes film noir, and written works in the genre often use techniques from detective fiction. There are sources who view that cyberpunk has shifted from a literary movement to a mode of science fiction due to the limited number of writers and its transition to a more generalized cultural formation.\n\nThe origins of cyberpunk are rooted in the New Wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 70s, where \"New Worlds\", under the editorship of Michael Moorcock, began inviting and encouraging stories that examined new writing styles, techniques, and archetypes. Reacting to conventional storytelling, New Wave authors attempted to present a world where society coped with a constant upheaval of new technology and culture, generally with dystopian outcomes. Writers like Roger Zelazny, J.G. Ballard, Philip Jose Farmer, and Harlan Ellison often examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution with an avant-garde style influenced by the Beat Generation (especially William S. Burroughs' own SF), Dadaism, and their own ideas. Ballard attacked the idea that stories should follow the \"archetypes\" popular since the time of Ancient Greece, and the assumption that these would somehow be the same ones that would call to modern readers, as Joseph Campbell argued in \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\". Instead, Ballard wanted to write a new myth for the modern reader, a style with \"more psycho-literary ideas, more meta-biological and meta-chemical concepts, private time systems, synthetic psychologies and space-times, more of the sombre half-worlds one glimpses in the paintings of schizophrenics.\"\n\nThis had a profound influence on a new generation of writers, some of whom would come to call their movement \"Cyberpunk\". One, Bruce Sterling, later said:\nBallard, Zelazny, and the rest of New Wave was seen by the subsequent generation as delivering more \"realism\" to science fiction, and they attempted to build on this.\n\nSimilarly influential, and generally cited as proto-cyberpunk, is the Philip K. Dick novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\", first published in 1968. Presenting precisely the general feeling of dystopian post-economic-apocalyptic future as Gibson and Sterling later deliver, it examines ethical and moral problems with cybernetic, artificial intelligence in a way more \"realist\" than the Isaac Asimov \"Robot\" series that laid its philosophical foundation. This novel was made into the seminal movie \"Blade Runner\", released in 1982. This was one year after another story, \"Johnny Mnemonic\" helped move proto-cyberpunk concepts into the mainstream. This story, which also became a film years later, involves another dystopian future, where human couriers deliver computer data, stored cybernetically in their own minds.\n\nIn 1983 a short story written by Bruce Bethke, called \"Cyberpunk\", was published in \"Amazing Stories\". The term was picked up by Gardner Dozois, editor of \"Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine\" and popularized in his editorials. Bethke says he made two lists of words, one for technology, one for troublemakers, and experimented with combining them variously into compound words, consciously attempting to coin a term that encompassed both punk attitudes and high technology.\n\nHe described the idea thus:\nAfterward, Dozois began using this term in his own writing, most notably in a \"Washington Post\" article where he said \"About the closest thing here to a self-willed esthetic “school” would be the purveyors of bizarre hard-edged, high-tech stuff, who have on occasion been referred to as “cyberpunks” — Sterling, Gibson, Shiner, Cadigan, Bear.\"\n\nAbout that time, William Gibson's novel \"Neuromancer\" was published, delivering a glimpse of a future encompassed by what became an archetype of cyberpunk \"virtual reality\", with the human mind being fed light-based worldscapes through a computer interface. Some, perhaps ironically including Bethke himself, argued at the time that the writers whose style Gibson's books epitomized should be called \"Neuromantics\", a pun on the name of the novel plus \"New Romantics\", a term used for a New Wave pop music movement that had just occurred in Britain, but this term did not catch on. Bethke later paraphrased Michael Swanwick's argument for the term: \"the movement writers should properly be termed neuromantics, since so much of what they were doing was clearly Imitation \"Neuromancer\"\".\n\nSterling was another writer who played a central role, often consciously, in the cyberpunk genre, variously seen as keeping it on track, or distorting its natural path into a stagnant formula. In 1986 he edited a volume of cyberpunk stories called \"\", an attempt to establish what cyberpunk was, from Sterling's perspective.\n\nIn the subsequent decade, the motifs of Gibson's \"Neuromancer\" became formulaic, climaxing in the satirical extremes of Neal Stephenson's \"Snow Crash\" in 1992.\n\nBookending the Cyberpunk era, Bethke himself published a novel in 1995 called \"Headcrash\", like \"Snow Crash\" a satirical attack on the genre's excesses. Fittingly, it won an honor named after cyberpunk's spiritual founder, the Philip K. Dick Award.\n\nIt satirized the genre in this way:\nThe impact of cyberpunk, though, has been long-lasting. Elements of both the setting and storytelling have become normal in science fiction in general, and a slew of sub-genres now have -punk tacked onto their names, most obviously Steampunk, but also a host of other Cyberpunk derivatives.\n\nPrimary figures in the cyberpunk movement include William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Bruce Sterling, Bruce Bethke, Pat Cadigan, Rudy Rucker, and John Shirley. Philip K. Dick (author of \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\", from which the film \"Blade Runner\" was adapted) is also seen by some as prefiguring the movement.\n\n\"Blade Runner\" can be seen as a quintessential example of the cyberpunk style and theme. Video games, board games, and tabletop role-playing games, such as \"Cyberpunk 2020\" and \"Shadowrun\", often feature storylines that are heavily influenced by cyberpunk writing and movies. Beginning in the early 1990s, some trends in fashion and music were also labeled as cyberpunk. Cyberpunk is also featured prominently in anime and manga: \"Akira\", \"Gunnm\", \"Ghost in the Shell\", \"Cowboy Bebop\", \"Serial Experiments Lain\", \"Dennou Coil\", \"Ergo Proxy\" and \"Psycho Pass\" being among the most notable.\n\nCyberpunk writers tend to use elements from hardboiled detective fiction, film noir, and postmodernist prose to describe an often nihilistic underground side of an electronic society. The genre's vision of a troubled future is often called the antithesis of the generally utopian visions of the future popular in the 1940s and 1950s. Gibson defined cyberpunk's antipathy towards utopian SF in his 1981 short story \"The Gernsback Continuum,\" which pokes fun at and, to a certain extent, condemns utopian science fiction.\n\nIn some cyberpunk writing, much of the action takes place online, in cyberspace, blurring the line between actual and virtual reality. A typical trope in such work is a direct connection between the human brain and computer systems. Cyberpunk settings are dystopias with corruption, computers and internet connectivity. Giant, multinational corporations have for the most part replaced governments as centers of political, economic, and even military power.\n\nThe economic and technological state of Japan is a regular theme in the Cyberpunk literature of the '80s. Of Japan's influence on the genre, William Gibson said, \"Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk.\" Cyberpunk is often set in urbanized, artificial landscapes, and \"city lights, receding\" was used by Gibson as one of the genre's first metaphors for cyberspace and virtual reality. The cityscapes of Hong Kong and Shanghai have had major influences in the urban backgrounds, ambiance and settings in many cyberpunk works such as \"Blade Runner\" and \"Shadowrun\". Ridley Scott envisioned the landscape of cyberpunk Los Angeles in \"Blade Runner\" to be \"Hong Kong on a very bad day\". The streetscapes of \"Ghost in the Shell\" were based on Hong Kong. Its director Mamoru Oshii felt that Hong Kong's strange and chaotic streets where \"old and new exist in confusing relationships\", fit the theme of the film well. Hong Kong's Kowloon Walled City is particularly notable for its disorganized hyper-urbanization and breakdown in traditional urban planning to be an inspiration to cyberpunk landscapes.\n\nOne of the cyberpunk genre's prototype characters is Case, from Gibson's \"Neuromancer\". Case is a \"console cowboy,\" a brilliant hacker who has betrayed his organized criminal partners. Robbed of his talent through a crippling injury inflicted by the vengeful partners, Case unexpectedly receives a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be healed by expert medical care but only if he participates in another criminal enterprise with a new crew.\n\nLike Case, many cyberpunk protagonists are manipulated, placed in situations where they have little or no choice, and although they might see things through, they do not necessarily come out any further ahead than they previously were. These anti-heroes—\"criminals, outcasts, visionaries, dissenters and misfits\"—call to mind the private eye of detective fiction. This emphasis on the misfits and the malcontents is the \"punk\" component of cyberpunk.\n\nCyberpunk can be intended to disquiet readers and call them to action. It often expresses a sense of rebellion, suggesting that one could describe it as a type of culture revolution in science fiction. In the words of author and critic David Brin:\n\n...a closer look [at cyberpunk authors] reveals that they nearly always portray future societies in which governments have become wimpy and pathetic ...Popular science fiction tales by Gibson, Williams, Cadigan and others \"do\" depict Orwellian accumulations of power in the next century, but nearly always clutched in the secretive hands of a wealthy or corporate elite.\n\nCyberpunk stories have also been seen as fictional forecasts of the evolution of the Internet. The earliest descriptions of a global communications network came long before the World Wide Web entered popular awareness, though not before traditional science-fiction writers such as Arthur C. Clarke and some social commentators such as James Burke began predicting that such networks would eventually form.\n\nSome observers cite that cyberpunk tends to marginalize sectors of society such as women and Africans. For instance, it is claimed that cyberpunk depicts fantasies that ultimately empower masculinity using fragmentary and decentered aesthetic that culminate in a masculine genre populated by male outlaws. Critics also note the absence of any reference to Africa or an African-American character in the quintessential cyberpunk film \"Blade Runner\" while other films reinforce stereotypes.\n\nMinnesota writer Bruce Bethke coined the term in 1980 for his short story \"Cyberpunk,\" which was published in the November 1983 issue of \"Amazing Science Fiction Stories\". The term was quickly appropriated as a label to be applied to the works of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Pat Cadigan and others. Of these, Sterling became the movement's chief ideologue, thanks to his fanzine \"Cheap Truth.\" John Shirley wrote articles on Sterling and Rucker's significance. John Brunner's 1975 novel \"The Shockwave Rider\" is considered by many to be the first cyberpunk novel with many of the tropes commonly associated with the genre, some five years before the term was popularized by Dozois.\n\nWilliam Gibson with his novel \"Neuromancer\" (1984) is arguably the most famous writer connected with the term cyberpunk. He emphasized style, a fascination with surfaces, and atmosphere over traditional science-fiction tropes. Regarded as ground-breaking and sometimes as \"the archetypal cyberpunk work,\" \"Neuromancer\" was awarded the Hugo, Nebula, and Philip K. Dick Awards. \"Count Zero\" (1986) and \"Mona Lisa Overdrive\" (1988) followed after Gibson's popular debut novel. According to the Jargon File, \"Gibson's near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the future in ways hackers have since found both irritatingly naïve and tremendously stimulating.\"\n\nEarly on, cyberpunk was hailed as a radical departure from science-fiction standards and a new manifestation of vitality. Shortly thereafter, however, some critics arose to challenge its status as a revolutionary movement. These critics said that the SF New Wave of the 1960s was much more innovative as far as narrative techniques and styles were concerned. Furthermore, while \"Neuromancer\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s narrator may have had an unusual \"voice\" for science fiction, much older examples can be found: Gibson's narrative voice, for example, resembles that of an updated Raymond Chandler, as in his novel \"The Big Sleep\" (1939). Others noted that almost all traits claimed to be uniquely cyberpunk could in fact be found in older writers' works—often citing J. G. Ballard, Philip K. Dick, Harlan Ellison, Stanisław Lem, Samuel R. Delany, and even William S. Burroughs. For example, Philip K. Dick's works contain recurring themes of social decay, artificial intelligence, paranoia, and blurred lines between objective and subjective realities. The influential cyberpunk movie \"Blade Runner\" (1982) is based on his book, \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\". Humans linked to machines are found in Pohl and Kornbluth's \"Wolfbane\" (1959) and Roger Zelazny's \"Creatures of Light and Darkness\" (1968).\n\nIn 1994, scholar Brian Stonehill suggested that Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel \"Gravity's Rainbow\" \"not only curses but precurses what we now glibly dub cyberspace.\" Other important predecessors include Alfred Bester's two most celebrated novels, \"The Demolished Man\" and \"The Stars My Destination\", as well as Vernor Vinge's novella \"True Names\".\n\nScience-fiction writer David Brin describes cyberpunk as \"the finest free promotion campaign ever waged on behalf of science fiction.\" It may not have attracted the \"real punks,\" but it did ensnare many new readers, and it provided the sort of movement that postmodern literary critics found alluring. Cyberpunk made science fiction more attractive to academics, argues Brin; in addition, it made science fiction more profitable to Hollywood and to the visual arts generally. Although the \"self-important rhetoric and whines of persecution\" on the part of cyberpunk fans were irritating at worst and humorous at best, Brin declares that the \"rebels did shake things up. We owe them a debt.\"\n\nFredric Jameson considers cyberpunk the \"supreme literary expression if not of postmodernism, then of late capitalism itself\".\n\nCyberpunk further inspired many professional writers who were not among the \"original\" cyberpunks to incorporate cyberpunk ideas into their own works, such as George Alec Effinger's \"When Gravity Fails\". \"Wired\" magazine, created by Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe, mixes new technology, art, literature, and current topics in order to interest today's cyberpunk fans, which Paula Yoo claims \"proves that hardcore hackers, multimedia junkies, cyberpunks and cellular freaks are poised to take over the world.\"\n\nThe film \"Blade Runner\" (1982)—adapted from Philip K. Dick's \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\"—is set in 2019 in a dystopian future in which manufactured beings called replicants are slaves used on space colonies and are legal prey on Earth to various bounty hunters who \"retire\" (kill) them. Although \"Blade Runner\" was largely unsuccessful in its first theatrical release, it found a viewership in the home video market and became a cult film. Since the movie omits the religious and mythical elements of Dick's original novel (e.g. empathy boxes and Wilbur Mercer), it falls more strictly within the cyberpunk genre than the novel does. William Gibson would later reveal that upon first viewing the film, he was surprised at how the look of this film matched his vision for \"Neuromancer\", a book he was then working on. The film's tone has since been the staple of many cyberpunk movies, such as \"The Matrix trilogy\" (1999-2003), which uses a wide variety of cyberpunk elements.\n\nThe number of films in the genre or at least using a few genre elements has grown steadily since \"Blade Runner\". Several of Philip K. Dick's works have been adapted to the silver screen. The films \"Johnny Mnemonic\" and \"New Rose Hotel\", both based upon short stories by William Gibson, flopped commercially and critically. These box offices misses significantly slowed the development of cyberpunk as a literary or cultural form although a sequel to the 1982 film \"Blade Runner\" was released in October 2017 with Harrison Ford reprising his role from the original film.\n\nIn addition, \"tech-noir\" film as a hybrid genre, means a work of combining neo-noir and science fiction or cyberpunk. It includes many cyberpunk films such as \"Blade Runner\", \"Burst City\", \"Robocop\", \"12 Monkeys\", \"The Lawnmower Man\", \"Hackers\", \"Hardware\", and \"Strange Days.\"\n\nThe Japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of Katsuhiro Otomo's manga series \"Akira\", with its 1988 anime film adaptation later popularizing the subgenre. \"Akira\" inspired a wave of Japanese cyberpunk works, including manga and anime series such as \"Ghost in the Shell\", \"Battle Angel Alita\", \"Cowboy Bebop\", and \"Serial Experiments Lain\". Other early Japanese cyberpunk works include the 1982 film \"Burst City\", the 1985 original video animation \"Megazone 23\", and the 1989 film \"\".\n\nCyberpunk themes are widely visible in anime and manga. In Japan, where cosplay is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. William Gibson's \"Neuromancer,\" whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in Chiba, one of Japan's largest industrial areas, although at the time of writing the novel Gibson did not know the location of Chiba and had no idea how perfectly it fit his vision in some ways. The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the 1980s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture.\n\nCyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside Japan. \"The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture. It is a culture that does not exist right now, so the Japanese concept of a cyberpunk future, seems just as valid as a Western one, especially as Western cyberpunk often incorporates many Japanese elements.\" William Gibson is now a frequent visitor to Japan, and he came to see that many of his visions of Japan have become a reality:\nModern Japan simply was cyberpunk. The Japanese themselves knew it and delighted in it. I remember my first glimpse of Shibuya, when one of the young Tokyo journalists who had taken me there, his face drenched with the light of a thousand media-suns—all that towering, animated crawl of commercial information—said, \"You see? You see? It is \"Blade Runner\" town.\" And it was. It so evidently was.\n\nCyberpunk themes have appeared in many anime and manga, including the ground-breaking \"Akira\", \"Appleseed\", \"Ghost in the Shell\", \"Ergo Proxy\", \"Battle Angel Alita\", \"Megazone 23\", \"Neo Tokyo\", \"Goku Midnight Eye\", \"Cyber City Oedo 808\", \"Bubblegum Crisis\", \"\", \"Angel Cop\", \"Extra\", \"Blame!\", \"Armitage III\", \"Texhnolyze\", \"Serial Experiments Lain\", \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" and \"Psycho-Pass\".\n\n\"Akira\" (1982 manga) and its 1988 anime film adaptation have influenced numerous works in animation, comics, film, music, television and video games. \"Akira\" has been cited as a major influence on Hollywood films such as \"The Matrix\", \"Chronicle\", \"Looper\", \"Midnight Special\", and \"Inception\", as well as cyberpunk-influenced video games such as Hideo Kojima's \"Snatcher\" and \"Metal Gear Solid\", Valve's \"Half-Life\" series and Dontnod Entertainment's \"Remember Me\". \"Akira\" has also influenced the work of musicians such as Kanye West, who paid homage to \"Akira\" in the \"Stronger\" music video, and Lupe Fiasco, whose album \"Tetsuo & Youth\" is named after Tetsuo Shima. The popular bike from the film, Kaneda's Motorbike, appears in \"Steven Spielberg\"'s film \"Ready Player One\", and CD Projekt's video game \"Cyberpunk 2077\".\n\n\"Ghost in the Shell\" (1989) influenced a number of prominent filmmakers. Its 1995 anime film adaptation inspired The Wachowskis to create \"The Matrix\" (1999) and its sequels. \"The Matrix\" series took several concepts from the film, including the Matrix digital rain, which was inspired by the opening credits of \"Ghost in the Shell\", and the way characters access the Matrix through holes in the back of their necks. Other parallels have been drawn to James Cameron's \"Avatar\", Steven Spielberg's \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\", and Jonathan Mostow's \"Surrogates\".\n\nThe original video animation \"Megazone 23\" (1985) has a number of similarities to \"The Matrix\". \"Battle Angel Alita\" (1990) has had a notable influence on filmmaker James Cameron, who was planning to adapt it into a film since 2000. It was an influence on his TV series \"Dark Angel\", and he is the producer of the 2018 film adaptation \"\".\n\nThere are cyberpunk video games. Popular series include the \"Megami Tensei\" series, \"Deus Ex\" series, \"Syndicate\" series, and \"System Shock\" and its sequel. Other games, like \"Blade Runner\", \"Ghost in the Shell\", and the \"Matrix\" series, are based upon genre movies, or role-playing games (for instance the various \"Shadowrun\" games).\n\nSeveral RPGs called \"Cyberpunk\" exist: \"Cyberpunk\", \"Cyberpunk 2020\" and \"Cyberpunk v3\", by R. Talsorian Games, and \"GURPS Cyberpunk\", published by Steve Jackson Games as a module of the GURPS family of RPGs. \"Cyberpunk 2020\" was designed with the settings of William Gibson's writings in mind, and to some extent with his approval, unlike the approach taken by FASA in producing the transgenre \"Shadowrun\" game. Both are set in the near future, in a world where cybernetics are prominent. In addition, Iron Crown Enterprises released an RPG named \"Cyberspace\", which was out of print for several years until recently being re-released in online PDF form. CD Projekt Red is currently developing \"Cyberpunk 2077,\" a cyberpunk first-person open world RPG video-game based on the tabletop RPG \"Cyberpunk 2020\".\nIn 1990, in a convergence of cyberpunk art and reality, the United States Secret Service raided Steve Jackson Games's headquarters and confiscated all their computers. Officials denied that the target had been the \"GURPS Cyberpunk\" sourcebook, but Jackson would later write that he and his colleagues \"were never able to secure the return of the complete manuscript; [...] The Secret Service at first flatly refused to return anything – then agreed to let us copy files, but when we got to their office, restricted us to one set of out-of-date files – then agreed to make copies for us, but said \"tomorrow\" every day from March 4 to March 26. On March 26 we received a set of disks which purported to be our files, but the material was late, incomplete and well-nigh useless.\" Steve Jackson Games won a lawsuit against the Secret Service, aided by the new Electronic Frontier Foundation. This event has achieved a sort of notoriety, which has extended to the book itself as well. All published editions of \"GURPS Cyberpunk\" have a tagline on the front cover, which reads \"The book that was seized by the U.S. Secret Service!\" Inside, the book provides a summary of the raid and its aftermath.\n\nCyberpunk has also inspired several tabletop, miniature and board games such as \"Necromunda\" by Games Workshop. \"Netrunner\" is a collectible card game introduced in 1996, based on the \"Cyberpunk 2020\" role-playing game. \"Tokyo NOVA\", debuting in 1993, is a cyberpunk role-playing game that uses playing cards instead of dice.\n\nSome musicians and acts have been classified as cyberpunk due to their aesthetic style and musical content. Often dealing with dystopian visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more squarely in the category than others. Bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include Psydoll, Front Line Assembly, Clock DVA and Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Some musicians not normally associated with cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring such themes. Albums such as Gary Numan's \"Replicas\", \"The Pleasure Principle\" and \"Telekon\" were heavily inspired by the works of Philip K. Dick. Kraftwerk's \"The Man-Machine\" and \"Computer World\" albums both explored the theme of humanity becoming dependent on technology. Nine Inch Nails' concept album \"Year Zero\" also fits into this category. Fear Factory concept albums are heavily based upon future dystopia, cybernetics, clash between man and machines, virtual worlds. Billy Idol's \"Cyberpunk\" drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the cyberdelic counter culture in its creation. \"1. Outside\", a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by David Bowie, was warmly met by critics upon its release in 1995. Many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including Sonic Youth, whose albums \"Sister\" and \"Daydream Nation\" take influence from the works of Philip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively.\n\nVaporwave and synthwave are also influenced by cyberpunk. The former has been interpreted as a dystopian critique of capitalism in the vein of cyberpunk and the latter as a nostalgic retrofuturistic revival of aspects of cyberpunk's origins.\n\nSome Neo-Futurism artworks and cityscapes have been influenced by cyberpunk, such as the Sony Center in the Potsdamer Platz public square of Berlin, Germany.\n\nSeveral subcultures have been inspired by cyberpunk fiction. These include the cyberdelic counter culture of the late 1980s and early 90s. Cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as \"cyberpunks\", attempted to blend the psychedelic art and drug movement with the technology of cyberculture. Early adherents included Timothy Leary, Mark Frauenfelder and R. U. Sirius. The movement largely faded following the dot-com bubble implosion of 2000.\n\nCybergoth is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration from cyberpunk fiction, as well as rave and Gothic subcultures. In addition, a distinct cyberpunk fashion of its own has emerged in recent years which rejects the raver and goth influences of cybergoth, and draws inspiration from urban street fashion, \"post apocalypse\", functional clothing, high tech sports wear, tactical uniform and multifunction. This fashion goes by names like \"tech wear\", \"goth ninja\" or \"tech ninja\". Important designers in this type of fashion are ACRONYM, Demobaza, Boris Bidjan Saberi, Rick Owens and Alexander Wang.\n\nThe Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong (demolished in 1994) is often referenced as the model cyberpunk/dystopian slum as, given its poor living conditions at the time coupled with the city's political, physical, and economic isolation has caused many in academia to be fascinated by the ingenuity of its spawning.\n\nAs a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new subgenres of science fiction emerged, some of which could be considered as playing off the cyberpunk label, others which could be considered as legitimate explorations into newer territory. These focused on technology and its social effects in different ways. One prominent subgenre is \"steampunk,\" which is set in an alternate history Victorian era that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk's bleak film noir world view. The term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to describe some of the novels of Tim Powers, James P. Blaylock, and K.W. Jeter, but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their collaborative novel \"The Difference Engine\" the term was being used earnestly as well.\n\nAnother subgenre is \"biopunk\" (cyberpunk themes dominated by biotechnology) from the early 1990s, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by genetic manipulation. Paul Di Filippo is seen as the most prominent biopunk writer, including his half-serious ribofunk. Bruce Sterling's Shaper/Mechanist cycle is also seen as a major influence. In addition, some people consider works such as Neal Stephenson's \"The Diamond Age\" to be postcyberpunk.\n\nCyberpunk works have been described as well-situated within postmodern literature.\n\nRole playing game publisher R. Talsorian Games, owner of the \"Cyberpunk 2020\" franchise, trademarked the word \"Cyberpunk\" in the United States in 2012. Video game developer CD Projekt, which is developing \"Cyberpunk 2077\", bought the U.S. trademark from R. Talsorian Games, and has filed a trademark in the European Union.\n\n"}
{"id": "48388470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48388470", "title": "Detroit: Become Human", "text": "Detroit: Become Human\n\nDetroit: Become Human is an adventure game developed by Quantic Dream and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation 4, released worldwide on 25 May 2018. The plot revolves around three androids: Kara (Valorie Curry), who escapes the owner she was serving to explore her newfound sentience and protect a young girl; Connor (Bryan Dechart), whose job is to hunt down sentient androids; and Markus (Jesse Williams), who devotes himself to releasing other androids from servitude. They may survive or perish depending on dialogue choices that shape the story.\n\n\"Detroit: Become Human\" is based on Quantic Dream's 2012 technology demonstration \"Kara\"; Curry returned to reprise the title role. To research the setting, the developers visited Detroit, Michigan. The script took writer and director David Cage, who consulted artificial intelligence experts, over two years to complete. They built a new engine to complement the game and cast hundreds of actors before commencing the process of shooting and animation. Philip Sheppard, Nima Fakhrara, and John Paesano served as composers for Kara, Connor, and Markus, respectively.\n\n\"Detroit: Become Human\" was met with generally favourable reviews from critics, who praised the setting, visuals, smaller moments in the story, main characters, their voice actors, the impact choices had on the narrative, and flowchart feature, but criticised the motion controls, mishandling of historical and thematic allegories, and aspects of the plot and characters. The game is Quantic Dream's most successful launch and has sold 1.5 million copies.\n\n\"Detroit: Become Human\" is an adventure game played from a third-person view, which is subject to a set and controllable perspective. There are multiple playable characters who can die as the story continues without them; as a result, there is no \"game over\" message following a character's death. The right analogue stick on the DualShock controller is used to interact with objects and observe one's surroundings, the left is for movement, and R2 scans an environment for possible actions; the motion controls and touchpad are also employed. Via quick time events and dialogue decisions, the story will branch out depending on which choices are made. These can be viewed in a flowchart during and immediately after a given chapter; the player can rewind to certain points in the story to reshape decisions in the event of regret. Certain scenes feature countdowns, which force the player to think and act quickly. Levels abound with magazines for players to read. The playable characters are:\n\nObtaining clues by highlighting and analysing the environment with augmented vision allows Connor to reconstruct and replay events that occurred before. The more information Connor collects within an allotted time, the greater the chance of success in deciding a course of action. Markus has the power to grant androids free will and calculate the outcomes of certain acts.\n\nCaretaker android Markus and his owner return home and alert the police of a suspected burglary. In confronting the perpetrator, Markus bypasses his programming, thereby becoming a deviant android with full autonomy, leading the police to shoot him at arrival. Markus awakes in a landfill of broken androids and, after escaping, discovers Jericho, a wrecked ship and safe haven for deviants. There, Markus rallies the others to fight for their rights. They perform several acts of civil disobedience, which catches the public's attention and gets more androids to join. This culminates with the FBI attacking Jericho. If he survives, Markus and the others set up a final march, resulting in either all of the deviants being killed or the president opening peace talks.\n\nPolice investigator android Connor is sent by the CyberLife corporation to assist Lieutenant Hank Anderson, an alcoholic who hates androids. In the course of their investigation into an outbreak of deviants, they either bond or fall apart, potentially resulting in Hank committing suicide. During his hunt for Markus' group, Connor starts to doubt himself, though he can stay firm in his beliefs. He eventually locates Jericho, where he can become a deviant himself. If he defects, Connor infiltrates CyberLife Tower and converts everyone there into deviants. If not, he attempts to snipe Markus during the final protest, but is stopped by a SWAT team or Hank. In the end, if peace is achieved, Connor can choose whether or not to shoot Markus during a speech.\n\nKara, a housekeeper android for Todd Williams and his daughter Alice, escapes with her after he attacks them and leaves Kara a deviant. The two travel across Detroit, intending to make it to Canada, which has no specific laws involving androids and where they will be safe. Kara and Alice befriend another android named Luther along the way, who joins them on their journey. They seek the aid of an android sympathiser, who points them to Jericho to obtain passports. They get caught up in the attack there, which may result in Luther, Kara, and Alice's deaths. Kara also learns that Alice is in fact an android, replacing the daughter taken away by Todd's wife. They can make it to Canada by bus or boat, survive a recycling centre, or in either case die trying.\n\n\"Detroit: Become Human\" had a development budget of €30 million. The game is based on Quantic Dream's 2012 PlayStation 3 technology demonstration \"Kara\", which received strong reactions and an award at the LA Shorts Fest. It starred Valorie Curry, who would later reprise the title role. Writer and director David Cage wanted to make the demo into a full game, despite not originally having planned to, because he was curious as to what would happen next. He took inspiration from Ray Kurzweil's \"The Singularity Is Near\", which explains that the rate at which human intelligence develops pales in comparison to that of a machine. Therefore, Cage proposes that machines may one day have emotions. Androids were designed with reference to artificial organs, how their energy would be generated, and human eye movement. An android's abilities were determined by each of their given profession. Experts in artificial intelligence were consulted to discern which technological advancements were the most feasible. Detroit was chosen as the setting to revitalise a city that had succumbed to economic decline after a historical contribution to American industry. The developers travelled to Detroit to conduct field research, taking pictures, visiting abandoned buildings, and meeting people.\n\nIn late 2013, Cage was in preproduction on \"Detroit: Become Human\", which he said would build upon his work on \"Heavy Rain\" and \"\". Cage's script – between 2,000 and 3,000 pages – was first relayed to the design team while programmers created the graphics as well as a new game engine with advancements in features like rendering, dynamic lighting, shading, bokeh, and physical cameras. Quantic Dream improved their game engine's depth of field after Mark Cerny, lead architect of the PlayStation 4, came to evaluate it. In October 2016, the screenplay was completed after more than two years. Writer Adam Williams was hired to help finish and flesh out the story. Cage used charts and diagrams to see where the choices would end up; penning \"five or six thousand pages of notes\", he likened the story to a Rubik's Cube. Two scenes were cancelled for how violence was portrayed. The casting extended to Los Angeles, London, and Paris in search for more than 250 actors to portray 513 roles. The actors were scanned in 3D, whose models were then made into characters. Shooting and animation followed, and on 8 September 2017, the performance capture was finished after 324 days. \"Detroit: Become Human\" was worked on by the 180 staff members at Quantic Dream and also outsourced to the Philippines, China, Vietnam, and India. The game has 35,000 camera shots, 74,000 unique animations, and 5.1 million lines of code.\n\nThe characters Connor and Markus are played by Bryan Dechart and Jesse Williams, respectively. Clancy Brown, Lance Henriksen, and Minka Kelly portray supporting characters Lieutenant Hank Anderson, Carl Manfred, and North, respectively. There are three different composers, one for each playable character: Philip Sheppard for Kara, Nima Fakhrara for Connor, and John Paesano for Markus. Sheppard's cello sequence in Kara's theme was inspired by the flames of a log fire, whereas the motif layered over it came from the two syllables in her name. Fakhrara created custom instruments and used vintage synthesizers in order that the sound could represent the robotic nature of Connor. Paesano's music was made with the idea that it would be \"like a church hymn\", personifying Markus' transformation into a leader. Sheppard recorded at Abbey Road Studios with the English Session Orchestra; Paesano was at Synchron Stage Vienna with the Synchron Stage Orchestra. Director of photography Aymeric Montouchet used \"thick grain and shaky long lens\" with shallow depth of field for Kara, \"small, tight grain\" and a blue palette for Connor, and orange and white colours for Markus. The game was released to manufacturing on 23 April 2018, after four years of production.\n\n\"Detroit: Become Human\" was announced on 27 October 2015 at a Sony press conference during Paris Games Week. It appeared at E3 2016 and E3 2017, showing trailers of additional playable characters and gameplay. Following E3 2017, Cage confirmed that the game would be released in 2018, later specified as the first or second quarter therein. The game was released on 25 May 2018 for PlayStation 4. If pre-ordered, \"Detroit: Become Human\" would come with a dynamic theme and digital soundtrack, while the digital deluxe edition included a copy of \"Heavy Rain\", a digital art book, digital soundtrack, two dynamic themes, and ten avatars. The soundtrack was available for streaming on 22 June 2018.\n\nAfter the 2017 Paris Games Week, a new trailer was criticised for its portrayal of child abuse, specifically a scene in which a 10-year-old girl is attacked by her father. Dechart defended the trailer, saying the story \"elicits empathy\". A demo of the first scene, \"The Hostage\", was made available on the PlayStation Store on 24 April 2018, accompanied by an Amazon Alexa skill that guides the player through the demo. The game was promoted in Japan with the live action short film, \"Tokyo: Become Human\". This was followed by a launch trailer and two animated English-language shorts introducing Elijah Kamski, the creator of the androids, and Chloe, the first android to pass the Turing test.\n\n\"Detroit: Become Human\" received \"generally favorable reviews\", according to review aggregator Metacritic. \"Destructoid\"s Chris Carter said that, despite tiring of Quantic Dream's penchant for detective stories, he enjoyed its execution and Connor's \"calm demeanor and android origin\". Carter praised the setting, calling it \"believable\" and \"captivating\", while also noting that the \"smaller moments\" were among its strengths. Michael Goroff of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" favoured the fact that the playable characters were androids because their second-class citizenship status created an \"effective viewpoint\". The controls and quick-time events were also subject to approval. Goroff lauded the \"incredibly satisfying and sometimes unexpected\" impact of the collective decisions and declared this the game's \"biggest accomplishment\". Writing for \"Game Informer\", Kimberley Wallace agreed with Carter's assessment of the \"little moments\" and said the character development was \"fun to watch\", well-handled, and the \"highlight of the game\". She appreciated how the branching narratives affected the latter parts and complimented Quantic Dream for the \"impressive\" achievement. Paul Tamburro at \"Game Revolution\" wrote that \"Detroit: Become Human\" boasted a \"compelling world ... enriched by fantastic performances and state-of-the-art motion-capturing\". He commended Curry, Dechart, and Williams for their \"engrossing performances\" and said the game was among \"the most well-acted\" around. He also felt the choices \"drastically\" changed the story.\n\nPeter Brown of \"GameSpot\" welcomed the variety of cycling between characters for ensuring player engagement. The game's \"most dreadful and horrific scenes\" made a considerable impression on Brown, some of which he found to be \"truly unforgettable\". Additionally, he remarked that the visuals were beautiful and \"captivating to behold\". \"GamesRadar+\"s Andy Hartup praised Quantic Dream for making \"an interactive story capable of provoking genuine, honest, and varied emotions\". He thought the consequences of the decisions were \"utterly delightful\", albeit rarely, and saw the setting as \"beautiful\". Hartup liked the character models, calling them \"the most remarkable you’ll see in gaming\", and favoured the eyes in particular. On the decision-making aspects, he proclaimed \"Detroit: Become Human\" \"the new gold standard ... for meaningful choice in gaming\". Lucy O'Brien at \"IGN\" wrote that the game \"manages to be a frequently moving melodrama that bends to your choices with meaningful results\". She also praised the acting of Curry, Dechart, and Williams, observing different benefits to each character. O'Brien appraised the general plot as \"big, ambitious fun\" and the environments as \"beautifully detailed\". Like Goroff, Wallace, Tamburro, and Hartup, O'Brien found the \"branching paths to be multiple and deep\", while also complimenting the flowcharts, a feature Colm Ahern of \"VideoGamer.com\" singled out as one of the game's few redeeming qualities.\n\nConversely, Carter criticised the game's \"surface level exploration\" of the Ship of Theseus, questioning the director's subtlety. He blamed the weakness of Kara's story on Cage's writing, called the portrayal of domestic and substance abusers \"cartoonish\", and complained about occasional \"wooden acting\". Goroff's only annoyance with the controls concerned its motion-sensitive feature, especially disparaging its use in quick-time events. Wallace thought Markus' story was the worst of the three, citing \"predictable speeches\" and \"black-and-white decisions\" as the primary problems. She suggested that the narrative suffered \"heavy-handed\" attempts at historical parallels, and noted, as Carter did, that its representation of abuse seemed \"exploitive due to the over-the-top antics\". She felt the use of the motion controls and touchpad was \"unintuitive\" and wanted more variety from the gameplay. Tamburro faulted the opening act for its \"slow\" and \"dull\" interactions, the quick-time events for their abundance, and occasional story paths for being \"highly questionable\". Brown viewed Markus as \"remarkably lacking in nuance\" and the allegories to actual history as \"on-the-nose\" and \"distracting\". He commented that the flowchart exposition was \"ultimately detrimental\" to player immersion and wished there was a way of disabling it. Hartup disliked the moments in which themes were either \"fumble[d]\" or \"pushed too far\". O'Brien observed multiple plotholes and found a considerable amount of \"clumsy\" exposition and dialogue. Ahern wrote in his verdict, \"\"Detroit: Become Human\" wants to move you ... The thing is, it really doesn't ... when the narrative is as cringey and ham-fisted as it is you won't want to play through it multiple times\".\n\n\"Detroit: Become Human\" reached fifth place on the UK chart after two days of release. In its first week, the game topped both the overall sales and console sales charts. Though it sold fewer copies than \"Beyond: Two Souls\" and \"Heavy Rain\" in that region, Cage and executive producer Guillaume de Fondaumière claimed \"Detroit: Become Human\" was the studio's most successful launch yet. The NPD Group later confirmed it had a sales growth in excess of twenty percent over \"Heavy Rain\". It was the third best-selling video game overall, generating the third-most revenue in the US, and sold the most out of any title on the PlayStation Store in May 2018, having been available for six days. The game released in Japan with 39,548 units (which rose to 56,480 after two weeks), second to \"\". In the UK, the second week also saw it become the second best-selling video game (behind \"FIFA 18\"). The game sold one million copies after the first two weeks. For the week ending 10 June, its physical sales fell to fourth place in the UK. Its Japanese sales hit 74,458 copies on 17 June, but dropped from the country's console chart one week later, when the game was placed ninth on the UK individual formats chart. Two months after release, a total of 1.5 million people had played the game.\n\nIn 2017, \"Detroit: Become Human\" won the award for \"Best of E3\" at \"GameSpot\"s Best of E3 Awards, and was nominated for \"Best PlayStation 4 Game\" and \"Best Adventure Game\" at \"IGN\"s Best of E3 Awards, and for \"Adventure Game\" at \"Hardcore Gamer\"s Best of E3 Awards.\n"}
{"id": "3268359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3268359", "title": "Ecological humanities", "text": "Ecological humanities\n\nThe ecological humanities (also environmental humanities) is an interdisciplinary area of research, drawing on the many environmental sub-disciplines that have emerged in the humanities over the past several decades (in particular environmental literature, environmental philosophy, environmental history and environmental anthropology). The ecological humanities aim to help bridge traditional divides between the sciences and the humanities, and between Western, Eastern and Indigenous ways of knowing the natural world and the place of humans in it (Rose 2004).\n\nThe ecological humanities are characterised by a \"connectivity ontology\" and a commitment to two fundamental axioms relating to the need to submit to ecological laws and to see humanity as part of a larger living system.\n\nOne of the fundamental ontological presuppositions of ecological humanities is that the organic world and its inorganic parts are seen as a single system whereby each part is linked to each other part. This world view in turn shares an intimate connection with Lotka's physiological philosophy and the associated concept of the \"World Engine\". When we see everything as connected, then the traditional questions of the humanities concerning economic and political justice become \"enlarged,\" into a consideration of how justice is connected with our transformation of our environment and ecosystems. The consequence of such a connectivity ontology is, as proponents of the ecological humanities argue, that we begin to seek out a more inclusive concept of justice that includes non-humans within the domain of those to whom rights are owing. This broadened conception of justice involves \"enlarged\" or \"ecological thinking\", which presupposes the enhancement of knowledge sharing within fields of plural and diverse ‘knowledges’. This kind of knowledge sharing is called transdisciplinarity. It has links with the political philosophy of Hannah Arendt and the works of Italo Calvino. As Calvino put it, \"enlarge[s] the sphere of what we can imagine\". It also has connections with Leibniz's Enlightenment project where, the sciences are simultaneously abridged while also being enlarged.\n\nThe situation is complicated however by the recognition of the fact that connections are both \"non-linear\" and \"linear\". The ecological humanities therefore, require both linear and non-linear modes of language through which reasoning about justice can be done. Thus there is a motivation to find linguistic modes which can adequately express both linear and non-linear connectivities.\n\nThere are three axioms of ecological humanities:\n\n\nPutting the first and second axioms another way, the connections between and among living things are the basis for how ecosystems are understood to work, and thus constitute laws of existence and guidelines for behaviour (Rose 2004)\n\nThe first of these axioms has a tradition in social sciences (\"see\" Marx, 1968: 3). From the second axiom the notions of \"ecological embodiment/ embeddedness\" and \"habitat\" have emerged from Political Theory with a fundamental connectivity to rights, democracy and ecologism (Eckersley 1996: 222, 225; Eckersley 1998).\n\nThe third axiom comes from the strong 'self-reflective' tradition of all 'humanities' scholarship and it encourages ecological humanities to investigate its own theoretical basis (and without which, ecological humanities is just 'ecology').\n\nSome theorists have suggested that the inclusion of non-humans in the consideration of justice links ecocentric philosophy with political economics. This is because the theorising of justice is a central activity of political economic philosophy. If in accordance with the axioms of ecological humanities, theories of justice are enlarged to include ecological values then the necessary result is the synthesis of the concerns of ecology with that of political economy: i.e. Political Economic Ecology.\n\nThe question of what language can best depict the linear and non-linear causal connections of ecological systems appears to have been taken up by the school of ecology known as systems ecology. To depict the linear and non-linear internal relatedness of ecosystems where the laws of thermodynamics hold significant consequences (Hannon et al. 1991: 80), Systems Ecologist H.T. Odum (1994) predicated the Energy Systems Language on the principles of ecological energetics. In ecological energetics, just as in ecological humanities, the causal bond between connections is considered an ontic category (see Patten et al. 1976: 460).

The word \"Erau\" is derived from the Kutai word \"eroh\", meaning crowded, noisy, joyful.\n\nThe legend began in the Kutai Kartanegara Ing Martadipura Kingdom in the 13th century, when it was situated in \"Tepian Baru\" or \"Kutai Lama\". It is a legend of the greatness of the Kingdom’s first Sultan, who was said to be a descent from BROT.\n\nThe story goes that in a village called \"Jaitan Layar\", in the East Kalimantan mountainous slope, a kingdom official and his wife has been married for a few years, but had not yet been blessed with a child. They would pray to their God, hoping that a child will soon be born.\n\nOne night, as the couple were sleeping, they were interrupted by a deafening noise from the outside. A bright light shone on the night as if it was daylight. The wife told his husband to check what the whole commotion is all about. When outside, the husband found a box made of golden stone. He opened the lid and inside he found a baby covered with a golden blanket. On the baby's right hand was an egg and on his left was a golden kris.\n\nSuddenly seven Gods appeared before him. One of the Gods would say,\n\nThe husband told the Gods that he will obey all of their commands and thanked them for answering his prayers. Once the Gods disappeared, he took the baby inside to his wife. The baby cried of hunger, confused as to what to do, the husband burnt incense, scatter yellow rice on the floor, and prayed to the Gods. Soon after, the God told the wife, “Wipe your breast with your hand repeatedly until milk is flowing.” The wife did as she was told and aromatic milk flowed, which the baby lapped up ravenously.\n\nFor the next 40 days and nights, obeying the Gods’ commands, the baby laid on the villagers’ laps. He was bathed with flower water. And on the third day, his umbilical cord broke off and the villagers celebrated the occasion by shooting fire to the sky for seven times. The baby was named \"Aji Batara Agung Dewa Sakti\".\n\nAs the boy grew up to be 5 years old, he was restless and impatient, he wants to be able to play outside, swim in the river, walk around the village like other children. The husband then remembered the God’s command and so he arranged with the villagers of Jaitan Layar to conduct the Erau ceremony. This was to be the first Erau ceremony. It was conducted lavishly for the next 40 days and nights. The Jaitan Layar community and its surrounding attended the ceremony.\n\nBefore the ceremony, buffalos were slaughtered and the corpses were prepared. During the \"Tijak Tanah\" ceremonial rite, Aji’s feet would be placed on the heads of buffalos, living and dead; and on human, living and dead. Then, covered with yellow cloth, Aji was accompanied to the nearby river where he bathed, performing the \"Mandi ke Tepian\" ceremonial rite. His feet would step on iron and on stone. The villagers, male and female, would then join him in the river. Afterwards, Aji was returned to his house while wearing lavish clothing. Accompanied by the song of \"Gajah Perwata\" orchestra and the sound of \"Sapu Jagat\" cannon, he was brought to the village yard where he laid on brightly coloured rugs. He was fed with betel leaves.\n\nThe party would then started in earnest. Food and drinks were free flowing, various performances and animal competition were held, men and women were dancing. The party continued for 7 days and nights. After the party, the decorations, utensils and musical instruments were then donated to the poor villagers.\n\nAji grew up and became the first Sultan of Kutai Kartanegara (1300–1325). During his inauguration, Erau ceremony was also conducted.\n\nThe Sultan married a beautiful princess named \"Putri Karang Melenu\", who was also thought to be the descendant of God. The story goes that she was initially a small worm found by a \"Hulu Dusun\" officer in \"Melanti\" village near Mahakam River while he was chopping wood.\n\nThe officer saw a worm that kept circling the block of wood and gazing at him tearfully. The officer took it home with him, where it grew up day by day, bigger and bigger until it became a dragon. But the dragon never left the house. One night, the officer dreamt that he met a girl who was to become his daughter. She said, “Father, don’t be afraid, let me leave this house and the village, build me a stairwell so I can slither down”. At once, he woke up and told his wife, Babu Jaruma.\n\nThe officer would then spend the days that followed building a stair made of \"lampong\" wood, with the steps made of bamboo and tied with \"lembiding\" roots. When he finished, he heard the girl’s voice again, “As I step down to earth, come and follow me. Burn some sesame and sprinkle some yellow rice around me. When I slither down to the river and swim, follow my spume”.\n\nThe dragon slithered down the stairs, to the river and swam seven times up and down the stream, came up the opposite river bank and slithered left and right three times when torrential rain came down, accompanied by strong winds and thunder.\n\nThe officer and his wife crossed the river with great difficulty. But then the weather cleared up and they saw that the river was filled with foam and rainbow-like lights were gleaming. The couple went closer to take a better look and saw a gong with a baby inside. The couple took the baby with them and brought her up as if she was their own. After three days, the baby’s umbilical cord broke, she was then named Putri Karang Melenu.\n\nWhen she grew up to become a beautiful young lady, the Gods united her with Aji, who was at the time already a Sultan. The couple had a son, which they named \"Aji Batara Agung Paduka Nira\".\n\nThe legend of \"Putri Karang Melenu\" is perhaps the story behind the \"Mengulur Naga\" procession of the Erau ceremony.\n\nEvery coronation of the Kutai Kartanegara Sultans, since the time that the first Sultan was inaugurated, had been commemorated with an Erau ceremony. Erau ceremonies then developed from being solely for the Sultan's coronation to a celebration commemorating the vesting of title to individuals for their outstanding service to the kingdom. The duration of the ceremony would depend upon the Kutai Palace’s wealth, it ranged from 7 days to a maximum of 40 days continuously.\n\nThe Erau ceremonies were traditionally organised by the Kutai palace courtiers, who would invite the kingdom's community leaders. Arriving from all corners of the kingdom, the leaders would bring supplies of food, livestock, fruits, and also artists for entertainment. The Sultan and his courtiers would then provide free meals to the kingdom's citizens as a gesture of the Sultan's gratitude to the dedication of his people.\n\nThe last known traditional Erau ceremony was in 1965, for the commemoration of the \"Sultan Aji Pangeran Adipati Praboe Anoem Soerya Adiningrat\" coronation. The traditional Erau ceremony ended along with the end of the Kutai Kartanegara Sultanate reign, when its territory was converted into the autonomous region of Kutai Kartanegara (abbrev. Kukar) Regency.\n\nIn the effort of preserving the cultural traditions of Kutai, the \"bupati\" (taken from a Sanskrit word, which contemporarily means the holder of executive power of the local government) of Kukar Regency government, Drs. H. Achmad Dahlan, mandated that Erau be a biennial festival commemorating the foundation of the capital Tenggarong on 29 September 1782. This biennial festival was first held in 1971.\n\nFrom the advice of Kukar's last Sultan, Sultan Aji Muhammad Parikesit, the district government is only allowed to exercise some traditional ceremonies, and not others such as the \"tijak kepala\" (literally \"step on head\") and the vesting of titles.\n\nActivities that are allowed are art and sport or agility performances, such as \"Menjamu Benua, Merangin Malam, Mendirikan Tiang Ayu, Upacara Penabalan, Pelas, Seluak Mudik, Mengulur Naga and Belibur\". Traditional tribal ceremonies allowed was from the Dayak tribe, such as \"Papaer Maper, Kuangkay, Mumutn, Ngayau, Lemakan Balei, Uman Undad, Pasek Truit, Erau Anak\". There are also the occasional Malay arts such as \"Tarsul\" and \"Badendang\".\n\nErau festival, held every September, has now been included in the Indonesian national tourism calendar of events. It is no longer associated with cultural tradition of the Kukar Sultanate palace, but rather to showcase the arts and culture that exist and thrive across the regency.\n"}
{"id": "4444054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4444054", "title": "Essay mill", "text": "Essay mill\n\nAn essay mill (also term paper mill) is a business that allows customers to commission an original piece of writing on a particular topic so that they may commit academic fraud. Customers provide the company with specific information about the essay, including: a page length, a general topic, and a time frame with which to work. The customer is then charged a certain amount per page. The similar essay bank concept is a company from which students can purchase pre-written but less expensive essays on various topics, at higher risk of being caught. Both forms of business are under varying legal restraints in some jurisdictions.\n\nThe idea behind term paper mills can be dated back to the mid-nineteenth century in which \"paper reservoirs\" were located in the basements of fraternity houses. Otherwise known as \"fraternity files,\" these essay banks were practices in which students shared term papers and submitted work that had been done by other students. These essay banks inspired the commercialization of ghostwritten essay-writing practices. As early as the 1950s, advertisements were circulating college campus that described services that included ghostwritten work for dissertations, theses, and term papers.\n\nIn conjunction with this practice, the changing attitudes of students in the 1960s and 1970s started to stray away from diligent and engaged course work because they saw an emphasis on the benefits of community involvement. A new focus on activities outside of the classroom took away from time to focus on class work, thus promoting these writing services throughout college campuses.\n\nSoon, actual businesses were providing custom-written essays for students in exchange for compensation. They were located near college campuses. One could walk into a building and peruse pricing pamphlets, speak to someone directly to place an order, or possibly make a selection from a vault of recycled research papers stored in the basement of these businesses.\n\n\"Essay mill\" companies hire university students, graduates, and professional writers to ghostwrite essays and term papers, and solicit business from university and college students by posting advertisements. Until the early 1990s, most essay mill companies were 'bricks and mortar' businesses offering their services by mail-order or from offices located in university or college towns. By the 2000s, most essay mill businesses have switched to an e-commerce business model, soliciting business and selling essays using an Internet website. Companies often provide free sample essays on popular topics to attract Internet searches.\n\nTo obtain an essay, a customer usually submits a form that describes the assignment that he or she wants completed, how many pages it needs to be, and when it needs to be completed by. On the opposite end of the transaction, the employee searches through requests until he or she finds something that sparks their interest. A writer will take anything that they know they can write something that will be quick and hit the page requirement. It does not matter if the writer has previous knowledge about the subject; if it is easy to research, he or she will get the job done.\n\nDepending on how much a student pays an essay mill, a student can receive a number of different products. The most expensive of these products would be a full-written essay (or even a dissertation) that a student can turn in. Requested papers can follow specific guidelines laid out by the student including the use of a certain amount of sources, a preselected topic, and the receiving of specific grade by the student. Some students may request to receive a high mark on a purchased essay in order to boost their Grade Point Average (GPA), while some may deliberately order an essay that will give them a \"C\" in order to reduce suspicion of academic fraud. One of the cheaper options an essay mill might offer is just a detailed outline of information a student should include in an essay that a student will write themselves. Due to the nature of this type of transaction, purchasing an outline is very hard for schools to catch as a form of an academic dishonesty.\n\nSimilar to essay mills, an essay bank is a company where students can go to purchase pre-written essays. Due to the nature of essay bank essays, students may find themselves more likely to be caught for committing academic dishonesty. As a result of this, essay bank essays in general may cost less than those from essay mills.\n\nAlthough essay mills and the students who use them are considered unethical by many educational professionals, they do not violate copyright law; the mill is the legal copyright holder of the papers, and the papers are licensed to paying students for limited use. The mill may, however, hold the student legally responsible in the case where they redistribute the paper to other students without the permission of the mill. In informal settings where students exchange papers without any formal licensing or transfer of copyright, copyright violation may occur, but it is unlikely that the students will press charges, since they would incriminate themselves by doing so.\n\nIn some countries, essay mills are legally allowed to operate because of the way in which they describe their services. Essay mills state that the papers that they produce are not intended to be submitted for credit, but rather to be used by the customer to generate ideas to his or her own paper. When asked if their services are considered cheating, one online company states that, \"No, it’s not. Dealing with us is pretty much like going to the library, where we would be acting as a helpful librarian helping you get enough material for a good grade. We are only offering you to make use of our take on your assignment and the results of our research on your paper's topic.\" The company is not responsible if the customer submits the essay verbatim for credit because that goes against the company’s terms of use.\n\nWhile there is no federal law against the operation of essay mills, there are over a dozen individual states in the US that have their own laws against them. The first major legal battle against an essay mill came in 1972 in the case of \"State of New York v. \". This case involved the state challenging an essay mill's business with reference to the New York Education Law. The law \"condemns the obtaining of a degree by fraudulent means or 'aiding and abetting' another to do the same.\" The state claimed that the students were using the term papers they purchased for credit and even though the company stated that the essays they wrote were for research purposes only, their advertising scheme encouraged otherwise by boasting about grades. The court determined that the disclaimers did not sufficiently protect the company because their encouragement of cheating and plagiarism hurt the educational system. The ruling called for the company to cease business in the State of New York. Several other legal battles have been fought since and have largely resulted in the punishment of the term paper writers rather than the students purchasing them.\n\nCalifornia Education Code Section 66400 \"penalizes the preparation or sale of term papers, thesis, or dissertations for compensation ...\" The law is applicable when the preparer/seller knew or should have known that the recipient would submit the paper for academic credit. State residents or academic institutions \"acting for the interest of itself, its students, or the general public\" can file suit against offenders for \"any relief as is necessary.\" This law differs from that of New York in various ways, including holding the vendor responsible even if it claims that the paper was not intended to be turned in for credit, if the court concludes that it should have known that it would, or if the claim is not credible. For example, while some essay mills state that their products are not intended to be submitted for credit, they may also boast of the high grades that their papers have received.\n\nThe 2011 Florida Statutes Section 877.17 states that it is a second degree misdemeanor to \"sell, offer to sell, or advertise for sale\" a \"written, recorded, pictorial, artistic, or other assignment\" to another for submission \"unaltered to a substantial degree.\" In the state of Florida, second degree misdemeanors are punishable by up to sixty days in prison.\n\nThe academic community has criticized essay mill companies for helping students to commit academic fraud.\n\nSome essay mills have defended themselves against criticism by claiming that they are selling pre-written examples which students can use as guidelines and models for the student's own work. In 2002, a UK-based essay mill called Elizabeth Hall Associates required students purchasing essays to sign a disclaimer stating that \"any material provided by Elizabeth Hall Associates [is] on the understanding that it is a guidance model only.\" Other essay mills claim that they are \"scholarly publishing houses\" that provide students with essays that the student can then cite in the student's own work.\n\nStudents from different academic backgrounds have used essay mills. Many prestigious universities and colleges have caught their students turning in papers they bought from essay mills. The University of California, San Diego caught 600 students cheating in one year. One of the forms of cheating was turning in papers bought from essay mills.\n\nUsing term paper mills brings up some ethical controversies. Some people view essay mills as unethical while others view it as completely moral. People view essay mills as ethical for different reasons. Some customers indicate that they use essay mills as a form of proof reading. Essay mill writers will read their writing only to make comments and feedback about content and grammar mistakes. They also turn to essay mills to insure that all citations are correct. Some customers claim that they turn to essay mills because society has put too much pressure on students to achieve academic success. GPAs and grades are greatly stressed in schools which causes students to worry and make them feel like they cannot meet their deadlines. In order to get the paper handed in on time, students seek out term paper mills. Essay mills have been compared to business situations. Certain students and customers view term paper mills as equivalent to companies outsourcing labor. Outsourcing labor is a norm for businesses which insinuates that the use of term paper mills should be socially acceptable.\n\nConversely, there are people who view purchasing essays from essay mills as unethical: it is a form of cheating and plagiarism because one person is taking credit of another individual’s work. Academic institutions are concerned about how essay mills affect learning. Students who use essay mills do not go through the process of gathering research, which is a learning experience in itself. Some professors, such as Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University and the author of \"The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty\", worry about the message term paper mills send to students. He believes the existence of essay mills validates slacking off. Ariely has come across essay mills use plagiarism-encouraging language on their websites.\n\nStudents generally know that using essay mill services is not right; according to a study conducted Patrick Scanlon and David Neumann, 90% of students surveyed admitted that the practice is unethical. However, the same study showed that students believe around 20% of their peers frequently use these online services.\n\nMany customers believe that when they are ordering an essay online, that they are going to be receiving one from their own country; however, this is not always the case, as many essay mill companies are hosted around the world. Not only are many of the essay mill companies hosted overseas, but many of the writers for these companies do not have graduate degrees, and have learned English as their second language.\n\nHaving essay mills set up overseas allows for the owners of these companies to make high profits by paying wages in low-wage countries while selling the work of their employees in high-wage countries. A 2009 article in The Chronicle of Higher Education stated that overseas writers only get paid between $1 and $3 per page out of the $20 to $30 US-customers pay per page. Compared to American writers that work for essay mills, this is a very low rate. Another article in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" from 2010 interviewed an American essay mill writer, who stated that he makes half of what the paper sells for.\n\nEven in the US, the amount that writers get paid can vary. Some American writers are only able to bring in around $1,000 per month in their highest paying months which can make some writers have to take up a second job. Other American writers are more successful when working for essay mills. Some of the better writers are able to make up to $5,000 per month.\n\nUniversities and colleges have developed several strategies to combat this type of academic misconduct. Some professors require students to submit electronic versions of their term papers, so that the text of the essay can be compared by anti-plagiarism software (such as Turnitin) against databases of known \"essay mill\" term papers.\n\nOther universities have enacted rules allowing professors to give students oral examinations on papers which a professor believes to be ghostwritten; if the student is unfamiliar with the content of an essay that he has submitted, or its sources, then the student can be charged with academic fraud, a violation of the rules by which a student agrees to be bound when he enters a university or college program.\n\nWhen a student is charged with academic fraud, his case is typically heard by a quasi-judicial administrative committee, which reviews the evidence. For students who are found guilty, the punishments range from a grade of zero on the specific assignment, to failure in the course in which the plagiarism occurred, to (in extreme or repeated cases) suspension or expulsion from the institution. In some cases, students who have committed academic fraud may also have academic honors, degrees, or awards revoked.\n\n\n"}

Festivity is based on the legend of the appearance of St. Blaise who helped the people of Dubrovnik to defend their town against Republic of Venice. Festivity is attended by a large number of people that include residents of the city, surrounding areas, other parts of Croatia and neighboring countries, as well as tourists, representatives of state and local authorities and Roman Catholic Church. Festivity was made a part of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2009.\n\nMinistry of Culture describes Festivity with these words: \"Besides the spiritual significance, Festivity in particular forms social relations and rules as well as the quality of government. Festivity as an expression of worship of a saint marked the whole culture and partly natural area of the City and the surrounding area, and through the participation of individuals and groups from other places in the country as well as those from neighboring countries, encourages intercultural dialogue.\"\n\nAfter ancient Greek colony Epidaurum was destroyed by Avars and Slavic invaders in the 7th century, refugees from Epidaurus fled to the nearby island Laas or Laus (meaning \"stone\" in Greek), from which \"Ragusa\" evolved into Dubrovnik. Immediately after the new settlement began to develop, greedy neighbors become envious of it and started to look for chance to destroy it. According to legend, the Venetians, while on their way to the Levant in year 972, anchored themselves near Gruž and Lokrum under the false pretense of restocking food, while their real intention was to conquer Dubrovnik. Saint Blaise appeared to priest Stojko while he was praying in the Church of St. Stephen, and ordered him to tell to Dubrovnik Senate about the real intention of the Venetians so Senate could prepare defence. People of Dubrovnik managed to prepare defence thus forcing Venetians to retreat. In order to thank St. Blase, people of Dubrovnik decided to declare him as Dubrovnik's main patron instead of previous Sergius and Bacchus.\n\nFestivity of St. Blaise was originated in year 972, and was a feast of all the inhabitants of the Dubrovnik Republic. In order to facilitate the participation to everyone, so-called \"Sloboština of St. Blaise\" was introduced. It was a time period during which every offender, convict and exile could freely come into the City for two days before and two days after the Festivity, while nobody could held him accountable. Sloboština was later expanded to seven days before and seven days after Festivity. The entire Republic of Dubrovnik was hugging in the City for the Festivity. Those who couldn't go would celebrate at home with their church banners and the national costume. They would thank St. Blaise for his protection in the past, and recommend themselves, and their families, for his protection in the future.\n\nFestivity starts on the day of Our Lady of Candelora, which is being celebrated on February 2, with the releasing of white doves, which symbolize freedom and peace, in front of Dubrovnik Cathedral, and by raising Saint Blaise's banner on Orlando's column. On the day of Our Lady of Candelora, people repeat the old dictum: \"Candelora, winter goodbye, Saint Blaise follows her and says it is a lie.\" On the day of the Festivity, on February 3, the numerous faithful and church dignitaries come to the City from nearby areas carrying the saint's relics across Stradun and city streets in a procession. Under a baldachin is relic of the shroud of Jesus. During procession, Bishop of Dubrovnik and priests carry St. Blaise's relics while people respectfully kiss hands, touch the relics, and pray for themselves and the city. In front of Dubrovnik Cathedral, also known as Saint Blaise's Church, the banners salute Saint Blaise, while priests bless the people using two crossed candles since it is believed that Saint Blaise protects throat. One of attractions of the Festivity is a group of trombunjeri who carry short and broad rifles on their shoulders which had been used in the past to create noise and frighten away enemies of the City. They fire their guns before entering the City, on present-day Brsalje Street, where, during the time of the Republic, shooting rifles and cannons was practiced. After the end of the, procession banners go with their flags to their villages in order to convey St. Blaise's blessings to all those who couldn't come to the City. Festivity was changed over the centuries with each new generation adapting it to their ideas and making it modern.\n\nFestivity of St. Blaise is also the Day of the City of Dubrovnik.\n"}
{"id": "1117384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1117384", "title": "Filing cabinet", "text": "Filing cabinet\n\nA filing cabinet (or sometimes file cabinet in American English) is a piece of office furniture usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple context, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. The two most common forms of filing cabinets are vertical files and lateral files. A vertical file cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15 inches) of the cabinet. A lateral file cabinet has drawers that extend from the long side (various lengths) of the cabinet. These are also called side filers in Great Britain. There are also shelf files, which go on shelves. In the United States, file cabinets are usually built to accommodate 8.5 × 11 paper, and in other countries, filing cabinets are often designed to hold other sizes of paper, such as A4 paper.\n\nOffice filing cabinets are typically made of sheet metal or wood. The drawers usually use a drawer slide to facilitate opening the drawer which includes an \"outstop\" to prevent the drawer from being pulled completely out of the cabinet. To open a drawer on most metal filing cabinets, a small sliding mechanism known as a \"thumblatch\" must be pressed to release and open the drawer. Each drawer has a handle to grip and pull the drawer with. On the front face of each drawer, there is usually a label holder to allow the user to identify the contents of the drawer.\n\nMany file cabinets incorporate a keyed lock to prevent unauthorized access to the documents being stored. There are two types of locks. A \"cam lock\" is activated with a key that rotates the lock. A \"plunger lock\" is opened with a key but can be closed by merely depressing the body of the lock. The plunger lock allows a user to quickly close and lock several cabinets in a short amount of time.\n\nSome file cabinets have a metal plate or wire structure at the back of each drawer which is known as a follower block. The follower block can be adjusted forward to reduce the length of the drawer so that the file folders contained within remain upright and at the front of the drawer for easier access.\n\nHenry Brown, an American inventor, patented a \"receptacle for storing and preserving papers\" on November 2, 1886. This was a fire and accident safe container made of forged metal, which could be sealed with a lock. It was special in that it kept the papers separated.\n\nThe invention of the vertical file remains an unsolved mystery. The Vertical Filing Cabinet section in the Early Office Museum website begins with a discussion of the erroneous conclusions by highly credentialed “secondary sources,” concerning the origin of vertical filing. The secondary sources claimed that a gold medal was presented at the World’s Fair of 1893 for a vertical file. The Early Office Museum found no evidence to substantiate those claims. However, the information presented in the Early Office Museum’s discussion of vertical filing cabinets suggests that the commercial introduction of vertical filing may have occurred in 1900 when a company named the Library Bureau (founded in 1876, later a division of Remington Rand) published a catalog that included a vertical filing cabinet.\n\nResearch by Ester Ellen-Poe validated The Early Office Museum's findings, and suggests that the most credible claim to the invention of vertical filing, as we know it today, appears to have been by the Library Bureau. The Library Bureau’s 1903 pamphlet titled “Library Bureau Systems of Vertical Filing with Interchangeable Unit Cabinets,” begins with: “Vertical filing, as originated [emphasis added] and perfected by the Library Bureau, is the most complete, accurate and practical method ever invented [emphasis added] for taking care of correspondence, catalogs, reports, invoices, orders, duplicate bills, and loose sheets, or papers of any kind for any business ---large, small or peculiar.” ().\n\nIn addition to the Library Bureau, early manufacturers of vertical filing cabinets included Globe-Wernicke, Yawman and Erbe Manufacturing Company, and the Art Metal Construction Company.\n\nPrior to the introduction of commercial vertical filing cabinets businesses kept papers in envelopes in turn stored in arrays of pigeonholes often lining a wall. Finding and opening envelopes and unfolding papers was troublesome and inefficient. However, the concept of vertical filing was clearly practiced as early as 1895 when a U.S. patent (533053) was issued to W.A. Cooke, Jr. for A Receptacle for Letters or Other Papers.\n\nAfter World War II, the Home-O-Nize Company was established in Muscatine, Iowa to provide returning veterans with jobs. Founded to produce steel kitchen cabinets, the company soon encountered the reality of the limited availability of steel. So the company began to make products for others. Finally a small amount of steel was secured and the company started manufacturing steel index card boxes. Soon after, larger cabinets began to be produced including filing cabinets. By designing to minimize the amount of steel, the product was an extremely cost-effective design and had huge commercial success. Home-O-Nize never did make kitchen cabinets and in 1961, the company name was changed to HON. Today, The HON Company, a division of HNI Corporation is the predominant North American manufacturer and marketer of filing cabinets.\n\nThe demand for filing cabinets was greatly expanded as a result of the commercial distribution of Xerography machines starting in 1950. This event enabled office workers to \"have their own copy\" of printed materials. Another influence is the expansion of government regulations that require businesses to create and keep forms and other documents. Some prognosticators have suggested the future of the filing cabinet is in doubt as electronic filing systems proliferate and become lower in cost. Nevertheless, most businesses are still purchasing computer systems with printing capabilities. Unless this trend is reversed, filing of paper is still a viable practice.\n\nIn the US, these come in two sizes: for letter-size paper and legal-size paper. Most modern commercially oriented vertical filing cabinets in the US are manufactured in two-, three-, four-, and five-drawer versions in depths of 25, 26½, and 28 inches. The drawers are typically supported on a three-member suspension system that allows the drawer to be fully extended for complete access.\n\nThe four-drawer vertical file, letter width, is the version purchased by most businesses. The two-drawer file is sold mostly for use alongside a desk. The five-drawer file is mostly purchased by Federal, State, and Local governments (in a version), as it typically provides the lowest cost per filing inch. Three drawer files, the least popular version, have the advantage of being at \"countertop\" height so end users can easily retrieve files and use the top of the cabinet as a work area to examine file contents.\n\nThe drawers of most vertical filing cabinets are engineered to accept hanging file folders, as these have come to dominate the way most users store information. Some files still have a \"follower block\" in each drawer. This is a device that adjusts the apparent depth of the drawer interior so that files are kept upright in the drawer. These are the legacy of a time when most filing was done with manila folders rather than hanging files.\n\nFor home offices or lighter use applications, vertical files are manufactured in versions. These typically have two-member suspensions and the drawers do not fully extend.\n\nLateral files are typically 20 inches deep and manufactured in 30-, 36-, and 42-inch widths and 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-drawer versions. The , two-drawer version is popular for use inside cubicle workstations, as it is engineered to fit under or alongside the cubicle work surfaces. Logic for the use of 3-, 4-, and 5-drawer files is similar to that of vertical files. Unlike vertical files, most lateral files allow for side-to-side or front-to-back filing.\n\nFor letter-size files arranged front-to-back, the 30- and 42-inch-wide files are the most effective, as the maximum amount of filing per cabinet is enabled. A file, with letter-width filing front-to-back has no more capacity than a corresponding file, as the additional space would be wasted.\n\nSome users prefer side-to-side filing, as they can search index tabs from a seated position. All-width lateral files can accommodate this configuration, though the capacity of the file is somewhat diminished.\n\nAn advantage for lateral files is that access and view of all files can be easier than with a vertical file because the drawers do not extend as far.\n\nIn most instances, the top \"5th drawer\" of a five-drawer lateral file is a flipper door with pull-out shelf, as most people would not be able to access the top of a drawer at this height.\n\nA shelf file is a cabinet designed to accommodate folders with tabs on the side rather than on the top. The cabinet has no drawers, only shelves. Some shelf files come with doors that recede into the cabinet. These cabinets are typically 12\" or 18\" deep, for letter or legal size folders respectively. Like lateral files, they are made in 30\", 36\", 42\" and 45\" widths but are usually only installed in 5-high and 6-high applications.\n\nSide tabbed files often use color codes that represent an alpha-numeric filing system. This methodology is a way to ensure files which are frequently retrieved and returned are easy to find and do not get lost. Finding a file is easy as to color-coded tabs easily lead the human eye to the appropriate location in the filing system. Similarly, a misfiled folder is obvious as an out-of-sequence color code is obvious to the user.\n\nBusinesses such as doctors, dentists, veterinarians, police, and government agencies use shelf files and end-tabbed folders to manage large filing systems.\n\nVariations on traditional shelf files, designed to offer increased capacity for a given floor area, include Rotary Storage systems.\n\nWithin the United States, the primary standard for vertical filing cabinets is the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (BIFMA) Standard X5.3. BIFMA used to maintain a separate Standard X5.2 for lateral filing cabinets, but that standard has been withdrawn. The standards provide requirements for cabinet stability, durability, and strength, among others. The General Services Administration (GSA) also maintains standards for vertical and lateral steel filing cabinets, A-A-3186\nand A-A-3187\nrespectively. The GSA standards define two grades of filing cabinets, medium- and heavy-duty. They reference the BIFMA standard for the medium-duty cabinets, and provide additional performance requirements for the heavy-duty cabinets. The GSA is also responsible for maintaining the standards for filing cabinets and security containers for storing classified materials; more information on that subject may be found in the article on classified information in the United States.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the dimensions and certain aspects of rigidity, construction, and safety are covered by BS 4438:1969 and BS EN 14073-2:2004. The safety standards revolve particularly against stability with drawers fully open. Interlocking mechanisms to prevent opening two drawers at once are not mandatory, but the employer's responsibility under the Health and Safety at Work Act makes them advisable. In other EU states the EN 14073-2:2004 harmonised standard will be endorsed by the relevant standards agency, such as DIN in Germany.\n\nIn Australia filing cabinets should be to AS 5079 a modified version of \"ANSI BIFMA X5.2-1997\".\n\nNon-US firms offer filing cabinets that permit A4 paper to be used in addition to letter-size. Double file cabinets have drawers which can each accommodate two racks for folders side by side.\n\nMany European companies engineer filing systems that accommodate hanging folders only; there are no drawer bottoms. In the US, most file drawers still have bottoms in the drawers so materials of any sort can be stored.\n\nUK file cabinets are slightly different from US in the width of the rails which support the suspension files, the US ones being narrower; the UK sizes are known as A4, foolscap and A3.\n\n\nChapter 3, \"A Brief History of Vertical Filing,\" In Get Organized at Home!

In the Golgulsa temple area can be found the oldest historical Buddhist ruins on Mt. Hamwol and the only cave temple in Korea.\n\nGolgulsa Temple (Korean: 골굴사, Chinese: 骨窟寺, Pronounced “Gol-gul-sa”) was established on Mt. Hamwolsan, along with Girimsa, by Master Gwangyu and his retinue who came to Korea from India about 1,500 years ago. Golgulsa Temple is the oldest grotto temple in Korea, emulating those in India.\n\nAccording to a painting of Jeong Seon (pen name; Gyeomjae) during the mid-Joseon era, Golgulsa Temple was established by constructing a wooden antechapel in front of several stone grottoes and covering it with tiles. The temple was left in ruins after it was burnt down in the mid to late Joseon era. Then about 70 years ago, the Bak clan of Gyeongju moved there and began reconstruction. The temple was sold to an individual in 1989, but Ven. Seol Jeogun, then head of Girimsa, eventually purchased it. Currently Golgulsa is registered as a branch temple of Bulguksa, the head temple of the 11th religious district, Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism.\n\nThe seated rock-carved Buddha (Treasure No. 581), the main Buddha of Golgulsa Temple, faces the underwater tomb of King Munmu, and around the Buddha are many grotto Dharma halls, such as Avalokitesvara Grotto, Ksitigarbha Grotto, Medicine Buddha Grotto, Arhat Grotto and Guardian Deities Hall. There are also relics of traditional folk religions such as rocks carved into phalluses and vaginas.\n\nRecently ex-Master Monk of Kirimsa (Kirim Temple), Seol Jeog-un constructed a road while simultaneously renovating the Golgulsa Temple.\n\nThe seated rock-carved Buddha of Golgulsa Temple was carved into the limestone cliff in the 9th century during the United Silla Dynasty; it is the main Buddha of the temple. The statue gazes toward the East Sea with a gentle smile and beautiful nimbus in which luxurious lotuses and flames are carved.\n\nNearer the ocean, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Golgulsa Temple, are the Gameunsa Temple ruins and the underwater tomb of King Munmu. Located southeast of the seated rock-carved Buddha, the ruins of Gameunsa Temple consist of two Three-Story Stone Pagodas (National Treasure No. 112). Standing 13.4 meters (44 feet) high, the two pagodas are aesthetically pleasing and well balanced; they are regarded as the standard of Korean stone pagodas.\n\nSoutheast of the ruins lies a small rocky island rising from the ocean; this is the underwater tomb of King Munmu and it is a symbol of King Munmu’s will to fend off the invading Japanese even in death. The tomb was established on this rock which is about 200 meters (656 feet) in circumference. Two waterways form a cross shape that divides the island, one running east to west and the other north to south. In a sunken area in the center is a small pool: that is his tomb.\n\nSunmudo training is composed of: “still training,” which includes “chwason,” or sitting meditation, yoga-like exercises as well as “active training,” which includes gymnastics and martial arts. There is usually “still training” in the morning and “active training” in the evening.\n\nGolgulsa Temple occupies half a mountain and actually contains several temples, administrative building, training hall, several dormitories, dining hall, and so on.\n\nIn recent years Golgulsa Temple has established the Seonmudo Practice Center to teach this traditional Buddhist martial art. Not only Koreans but also many foreigners flock to the temple to learn it.\n\nThe formal name of Sunmudo is \"Bulgyo Geumgang Yeong Gwon\". It is a training method taught at Golgulsa Temple designed to extinguish worldly pains and attain enlightenment. The goal of this training is harmonization of mind and body united with breathing.\n\nGolgulsa temple has run Sunmudo training programs since 1992 for those who would like to experience the traditions of Korean Seon (Zen) Buddhism including Sonmudo.\n\nIt also offers temple stay programs where visitors can experience Buddhist culture.\n\n"}
{"id": "259162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=259162", "title": "Grade (slope)", "text": "Grade (slope)\n\nThe grade (also called slope, incline, gradient, mainfall, pitch or rise) of a physical feature, landform or constructed line refers to the tangent of the angle of that surface to the horizontal. It is a special case of the slope, where zero indicates horizontality. A larger number indicates higher or steeper degree of \"tilt\". Often slope is calculated as a ratio of \"rise\" to \"run\", or as a fraction (\"rise over run\") in which \"run\" is the horizontal distance (not the distance along the slope) and \"rise\" is the vertical distance.\n\nThe grades or slopes of existing physical features such as canyons and hillsides, stream and river banks and beds are often described. Grades are typically specified for new linear constructions (such as roads, landscape grading, roof pitches, railroads, aqueducts, and pedestrian or bicycle circulation routes). The grade may refer to the longitudinal slope or the perpendicular cross slope.\n\nThere are several ways to express slope:\n\nAny of these may be used. Grade is usually expressed as a percentage, but this is easily converted to the angle α from horizontal or the other expressions.\n\nSlope may still be expressed when the horizontal run is not known: the rise can be divided by the hypotenuse (the slope length). This is not the usual way to specify slope; it follows the sine function rather than the tangent function, so it calls a 45-degree slope a 71-percent grade instead of a 100-percent. But in practice the usual way to calculate slope is to measure the distance along the slope and the vertical rise, and calculate the horizontal run from that. When the angle of inclination is small, using the slope length rather than the horizontal displacement (i.e., using the sine of the angle rather than the tangent) makes only an insignificant difference. Railway gradients are usually expressed in terms of the rise in relation to the distance along the track as a practical measure. In cases where the difference between sin and tan is significant, the tangent is used. In any case, the following identity holds for all inclinations up to 90 degrees:\nformula_3.\n\nIn Europe, road gradients are signed as a percentage.\n\nGrades are related using the following equations with symbols from the figure at top.\n\nThis ratio can also be expressed as a percentage by multiplying by 100.\n\nIf the tangent is expressed as a percentage, the angle can be determined as:\n\nIf the angle is expressed as a ratio \"(1 in n)\" then:\n\nIn vehicular engineering, various land-based designs (automobiles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, trains, etc.) are rated for their ability to ascend terrain. Trains typically rate much lower than automobiles. The highest grade a vehicle can ascend while maintaining a particular speed is sometimes termed that vehicle's \"gradeability\" (or, less often, \"grade ability\"). The lateral slopes of a highway geometry are sometimes called fills or cuts where these techniques have been used to create them.\n\nIn the United States, maximum grade for Federally funded highways is specified in a design table based on terrain and design speeds, with up to 6% generally allowed in mountainous areas and hilly urban areas with exceptions for up to 7% grades on mountainous roads with speed limits below .\n\nThe steepest roads in the world are Baldwin Street in Dunedin, New Zealand and Canton Avenue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Guinness World Record lists Baldwin Street as the steepest street in the world, with a 35% grade (19°,1 in 3 slope UK) overall and disputed 38% grade (21°) at its steepest section. The Pittsburgh Department of Engineering and Construction recorded a grade of 37% (20°) for Canton Avenue. The street has formed part of a bicycle race since 1983.\n\nThe San Francisco Municipal Railway operates bus service among the city's hills. The steepest grade for bus operations is 23.1% by the \"67-Bernal Heights\" on Alabama Street between Ripley and Esmeralda Streets.\n\nGrade, pitch, and slope are important components in landscape design, garden design, landscape architecture, and architecture; for engineering and aesthetic design factors. Drainage, slope stability, circulation of people and vehicles, complying with building codes, and design integration are all aspects of slope considerations in environmental design.\n\nRuling gradients limit the load that a locomotive can haul, including the weight of the locomotive itself. On a 1% gradient (1 in 100) a locomotive can pull half (or less) of the load that it can pull on level track. (A heavily loaded train rolling at 20 km/h on heavy rail may require ten times the pull on a 1% upgrade that it does on the level at that speed.) Early railways in the United Kingdom were laid out with very gentle gradients, such as 0.05% (1 in 2000), because the early locomotives (and their brakes) were feeble. Steep gradients were concentrated in short sections of lines where it was convenient to employ assistant engines or cable haulage, such as the section from Euston to Camden Town. Extremely steep gradients require the use of cables (such as the Scenic Railway at Katoomba Scenic World, Australia, with a maximum grade of 122% (52°), claimed to be the world's steepest passenger-carrying funicular) or some kind of rack railway (such as the Pilatus railway in Switzerland, with a maximum grade of 48% (26°), claimed to be the world's steepest rack railway) to help the train ascend or descend.\n\nGradients can be expressed as an angle, as feet per mile, feet per chain, 1 in n, x% or y per mille. Since surveyors like round figures, the method of expression can affect the gradients selected.\n\nThe steepest railway lines that do not use a rack system include:\n\nGradients on sharp curves are effectively a bit steeper than the same gradient on straight track, so to compensate for this and make the ruling grade uniform throughout, the gradient on those sharp curves should be reduced slightly.\n\nIn the era before trains were provided with continuous brakes, whether air brakes or vacuum brakes, steep gradients were a serious problem, and it was difficult to stop safely if the line was on a steep grade. In an extreme example, the Inspector insisted that Rudgwick railway station in West Sussex be regraded before he would allow it to open. This required the gradient through the platform to be eased from 1 in 80 to 1 in 130.\n\n"}

It played a highly influential role in the Kolkata literary scene in the decades after Indian independence and provided a platform for young, experimental poets, many of whom went on to become luminaries of modern Bengali poetry.\n\nThe editors of the inaugural issue in July 1953 were Sunil Gangopadhyay, Ananda Bagchi and Dipak Mazumdar. Gangopadhyay later became sole editor, and indeed it is his name that is most closely associated with the magazine. Others who also edited the magazine at one point or another included Shakti Chattopadhyay, Sarat Kumar Mukhopadhyay and Samarendra Sengupta. The Phanishwarnath Renu issue of the magazine was edited by Samir Roychoudhury. During 1961-65 several poets left the magazine and joined the Hungryalist Movement.\n\nOriginally published as a quarterly, \"Krittibas\" became a monthly magazine in 1974. Besides promoting Bengali poetry, always its main focus, it also featured articles on various aspects of contemporary arts and culture.\n\nIn its early decades, \"Krittibas\" had a strong anti-establishment flavour to it. (In 1963, the Hungryalists were hauled into court on charges of obscenity; the Editor of the magazine, as defense witness for Malay Roy Choudhury responded by reading out the controversial poem Stark Electric Jesus in the courtroom!) But with the accretion of time and prestige, this trend waned and \"Krittibas\" itself became part of the cultural establishment.\n\nPublication ceased altogether in 1982, and the magazine disappeared from the scene for many years. Then in 1999, \"Krittibas\" was reborn, this time as an annual magazine. Soon it became a bi-annual journal, and then turned into a quarterly again. Those Kolkatans who have been instrumental in the revival of the magazine are Bhaskar Dutta, Pradip Chandra Basu and Ashik Kumar Dasgupta.\n\nIn 2003, \"Krittibas\" celebrated its 50th anniversary with great fanfare. In 2013, another function was held at the Indian National Museum to celebrate its 60th anniversary.\n\n"}
{"id": "12835704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12835704", "title": "Kyrgyz cuisine", "text": "Kyrgyz cuisine\n\nKyrgyz cuisine is the cuisine of the Kyrgyz, who comprise a majority of the population of Kyrgyzstan. The cuisine is similar in many aspects to that of their neighbors, particularly Kazakh cuisine.\n\nTraditional Kyrgyz food revolves around mutton, beef and horse meat, as well as various dairy products. The preparation techniques and major ingredients have been strongly influenced by the nation's historically nomadic way of life. Thus, many cooking techniques are conducive to the long-term preservation of food. Mutton and beef are the favorite meats, although in modern times many Kyrgyz are unable to afford them regularly.\n\nKyrgyzstan is home to many different nationalities and their various cuisines. In larger cities, such as Bishkek, Osh, Jalal-Abad, and Karakol, various national and international cuisines can be found. Non-Kyrgyz cuisines that are particularly common and popular in Kyrgyzstan include Uyghur, Dungan, Uzbek, and Russian cuisines, representing the largest minorities in the country.\n\nMeat in various forms has always been an essential part of Kyrgyz cuisine. Among the most popular meat dishes are horse-meat sausages (kazy or chuchuk), roasted sheep's liver, beshbarmak (a dish containing boiled and shredded meat with thin noodles), and various other delicacies made from horse meat.\n\nBeshbarmak is the Kyrgyz national dish, although it is also common in Kazakhstan and in Xinjiang (where it is called \"narin\"). It consists of horse meat (and sometimes mutton or beef) boiled in its own broth for several hours and served over homemade noodles sprinkled with parsley and coriander. \"Beshbarmak\" means \"Five Fingers\" in the Kyrgyz language, and is so called probably because the dish is typically eaten with the hands. Beshbarmak is most often made during a feast to celebrate the birth of a new child, an important birthday, or to mourn a death in the family, either at a funeral or on an anniversary. If mutton is used instead of horse meat, a boiled sheep's head is placed on the table in front of the most honored guest, who cuts bits and parts from the head and offers them around to the other guests at the table.\n\nKuurdak is one of the main meat dishes.\n\nShashlik, skewered chunks of mutton grilled over smoking coals that come with raw sliced onions, is served in restaurants and often sold on the street. The meat is usually marinated for hours before cooking. Shashlik can also be made from beef, chicken, and fish. Each shashlik typically has a fat-to-meat ratio of one-to-one.\n\nShorpo (or \"sorpo\") is a meat soup.\n\n\"Paloo\" ( or күрүч/аш) is the Kyrgyz version of what is generally referred to as plov in Central Asian cuisine. It consists of pieces of meat (generally mutton or beef, but sometimes chicken) fried in a large qazan (a cast-iron cauldron) and mixed with fried shredded carrots, \"jiucai\"(garlic chives) and cooked rice. The dish is garnished with whole fried garlic cloves and hot red peppers. \"Uzgen paloo\" is made with locally grown rice from the southern Uzgen District of Kyrgyzstan. \"Shirin paloo\", a close relative of shirin plov in Azerbaijani cuisine, is a vegetarian dish in which meat is replaced with dried fruits, such as prunes, apricots, and raisins.\n\nPaloo is the Kyrgyzified form of the Persian word \"polow\" or \"polo\", related in etymology to pilaf. In Russian the dish is called \"plov\" (), in Turkish \"pilav\", in Turkic languages \"ash\", and in Tajik \"osh\".\n\n\"Manty\" are steamed dumplings filled with ground meat and onions.\n\n\"Samsa\" are little pockets with meat and vegetables wrapped in flaky pastry or bread, very similar to Indian samosas. They are most often stuffed with mutton and fat, but are also made with chicken, cheese, cabbage, beef, and even pumpkin. They can be bought in most bazaars or on street corners in larger cities.\n\n\"Lagman\" (or \"laghman\") is a very popular noodle dish. It consists of thick noodles created by stretching a very simple flour dough, then covered in chopped peppers and other vegetables and served in a spicy vinegary sauce. Lagman is served everywhere in Kyrgyzstan, but is considered a Dungan or Uyghur dish.\n\nCommon types of bread ( []) available in Kyrgyzstan include Central Asian flat bread (naan), and thick, sturdy Russian breads. Central Asian flat bread is cooked over coals in tandoori ( []) ovens, and is round and relatively flat.\n\nMore traditional bread products include qattama and boorsoq, two types of fried bread.\n\nThe Kyrgyz often eat various breads by dipping it in jam, kaymak, butter (or \"sary may\"), etc. Boorsoq is sometimes eaten suspended in tea, or dipped in honey.\n\nBread is valued as sacred in Kyrgyz culture, and a good host always offers a guest bread at the very least (often with tea), even if the guest is only staying for a few moments.\n\nA popular Kyrgyz beverage is kymyz ( ), a slightly alcoholic drink made by fermenting mare's milk. This drink is considered to be the signature drink of Euroasian nomadic culture, as it is also consumed in Kazakhstan and Mongolia. Fresh kymyz is only available in the summer, from about May until August, when it can commonly be purchased by the roadside in mountainous areas. Bottled kymyz is also available year-round in most food shops in the country.\n\nThere are many beverages which could be described as traditional Kyrgyz drinks. One such non-alcoholic beverage which is very popular in Kyrgyzstan, especially in the summer, is maksym, a slightly fizzy drink made by fermenting grains. Maksym was traditionally made in small quantities by women for family consumption; however, this drink was introduced as a commercial product in Bishkek by the company 'Shoro', after which it became widely available all over Kyrgyzstan. Maksym is usually made from malt, but other types of grains may be used in its preparation. There are different methods and recipes for it which vary by region. It is prepared by boiling grounded malt or other type of cereals in water. After reaching a certain state of readiness this substance is cooled and undergoes a fermentation process caused by yeast. Maksym is usually consumed chilled.\n\nJarma is a similar drink derived from ground cereals. It is made in almost the same way as \"maksym\", except that it isn't fermented, instead it is mixed with ayran to make it slightly fizzy.\n\nAnother fizzy drink made from ayran is chalap (sometimes marketed as Tan). Other traditional drinks are sheep's milk and its products (such as qurut) and camel's milk. The two primary companies which commercially produce Kyrgyz national drinks are Shoro and Enesay.\n\nBozo is slightly alcoholic drink prepared from wheat.\n\n"}

They can be prose or poetry. Many take the form of an urban eulogy (variously referred to as an encomium urbis, laudes urbium, encomium civis, laus civis, laudes civitatum\"; or in English: urban or city encomium, panegyric, laudation or praise poem) which praise their subject. Laments to a city's past glories are sometimes also included in the genre. \"Descriptiones\" often mix topographical information with abstract material on the spiritual and legal aspects of the town or city, and with social observations on its inhabitants. They generally give a more extended treatment of their urban subject than is found in an encyclopedia or general geographical work. Influential examples include Benedict's \"Mirabilia Urbis Romae\" of around 1143.\n\nThe Greek rhetorician Dionysius of Halicarnassus, in the first century AD, was the first to prescribe the form of a eulogy to a city in detail. Features he touches on include the city's location, size and beauty; the qualities of its river; its temples and secular buildings; its origin and founder, and the acts of its citizens. The Roman rhetorician Quintilian expounds on the form later in the first century, stressing praise of the city's founder and prominent citizens, as well as the city's site and location, fortifications and public works such as temples. The third-century rhetorician Menander expands on the guidelines further, including advice on how to turn a city's bad points into advantages. These works were probably not directly available to medieval writers, but the form is outlined in many later grammar primers, including those by Donatus and Priscian. Priscian's \"Praeexercitamina\", a translation into Latin of a Greek work by Hermogenes, was a particular influence on medieval authors.\n\nSurviving late Roman examples of \"descriptiones\" include Ausonius's \"Ordo Nobilium Urbium\", a fourth-century Latin poem that briefly describes thirteen cities including Milan and Bordeaux. Rutilius Namatianus's \"De reditu suo\" is a longer poem dating from the early fifth century that includes a section praising Rome.\n\nNumerous medieval examples have survived, mainly but not exclusively in Latin, the earliest dating from the eighth century. They adapt the classical form to Christian theology. The form was popularised by widely circulated guidebooks intended for pilgrims. Common topics include the city walls and gates, markets, churches and local saints; \"descriptiones\" were sometimes written as a preface to the biography of a saint. The earliest examples are in verse. The first known prose example was written in around the tenth century, and later medieval examples were more often written in prose. Milan and Rome are the most frequent subjects, and there are also examples describing many other Italian cities. Outside Italy, pre-1400 examples are known for Chester, Durham, London, York and perhaps Bath in England, Newborough in Wales, and Angers, Paris and Senlis in France. The form spread to Germany in the first half of the 15th century, with Nuremberg being the most commonly described city.\n\nJ. K. Hyde, who surveyed the genre in 1966, considers the evolution of \"descriptiones\" written before 1400 to reflect \"the growth of cities and the rising culture and self-confidence of the citizens\", rather than any literary progression. Later medieval examples tend to be more detailed and less generic than early ones, and to place an increasing emphasis on secular over religious aspects. For example, Bonvesin della Riva's 1288 description of Milan, \"De Magnalibus Urbis Mediolani\", contains a wealth of detailed facts and statistics about such matters as local crops. These trends were continued in Renaissance \"descriptiones\", which flourished from the early years of the 15th century, especially after the popularisation of the printing press from the middle of that century.\n\nThe following chronological list presents urban descriptions and eulogies written before the end of the 14th century, based mainly on the reviews of Hyde and Margaret Schlauch, with a selection from the many examples written from 1400 to 1550. \n"}

They are sometimes called Lebesgue spaces, named after Henri Lebesgue , although according to the Bourbaki group they were first introduced by Frigyes Riesz .\nL spaces form an important class of Banach spaces in functional analysis, and of topological vector spaces.\nBecause of their key role in the mathematical analysis of measure and probability spaces, Lebesgue spaces are used also in the theoretical discussion of problems in physics, statistics, finance, engineering, and other disciplines.\n\nIn statistics, measures of central tendency and statistical dispersion, such as the mean, median, and standard deviation, are defined in terms of \"L\" metrics, and measures of central tendency can be characterized as solutions to variational problems.\n\nIn penalized regression, 'L1 penalty' and 'L2 penalty' refer to penalizing either the \"L\" norm of a solution's vector of parameter values (i.e. the sum of its absolute values), or its \"L\" norm (its Euclidean length). Techniques which use an L1 penalty, like LASSO, encourage solutions where many parameters are zero. Techniques which use an L2 penalty, like ridge regression, encourage solutions where most parameter values are small. Elastic net regularization uses a penalty term that is a combination of the \"L\" norm and the \"L\" norm of the parameter vector.\n\nThe Fourier transform for the real line (or, for periodic functions, see Fourier series), maps \"L\"(R) to \"L\"(R) (or \"L\"(T) to ℓ) respectively, where 1 ≤ \"p\" ≤ 2 and 1/\"p\" + 1/\"q\" = 1. This is a consequence of the Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem, and is made precise with the Hausdorff–Young inequality.\n\nBy contrast, if \"p\" > 2, the Fourier transform does not map into \"L\".\n\nHilbert spaces are central to many applications, from quantum mechanics to stochastic calculus. The spaces \"L\" and ℓ are both Hilbert spaces. In fact, by choosing a Hilbert basis (i.e., a maximal orthonormal subset of \"L\" or any Hilbert space), one sees that all Hilbert spaces are isometric to ℓ(\"E\"), where \"E\" is a set with an appropriate cardinality.\n\nThe length of a vector in the -dimensional real vector space is usually given by the Euclidean norm:\n\nThe Euclidean distance between two points and is the length of the straight line between the two points. In many situations, the Euclidean distance is insufficient for capturing the actual distances in a given space. An analogy to this is suggested by taxi drivers in a grid street plan who should measure distance not in terms of the length of the straight line to their destination, but in terms of the rectilinear distance, which takes into account that streets are either orthogonal or parallel to each other. The class of -norms generalizes these two examples and has an abundance of applications in many parts of mathematics, physics, and computer science.\n\nFor a real number , the -norm or -norm of is defined by\n\nThe absolute value bars are unnecessary when \"p\" is a rational number and, in reduced form, has an even numerator.\n\nThe Euclidean norm from above falls into this class and is the 2-norm, and the 1-norm is the norm that corresponds to the rectilinear distance.\n\nThe -norm or maximum norm (or uniform norm) is the limit of the -norms for formula_3. It turns out that this limit is equivalent to the following definition:\n\nSee L-infinity.\n\nFor all , the -norms and maximum norm as defined above indeed satisfy the properties of a \"length function\" (or norm), which are that:\nAbstractly speaking, this means that together with the -norm is a Banach space. This Banach space is the -space over .\n\nThe grid distance or rectilinear distance (sometimes called the \"Manhattan distance\") between two points is never shorter than the length of the line segment between them (the Euclidean or \"as the crow flies\" distance). Formally, this means that the Euclidean norm of any vector is bounded by its 1-norm:\n\nThis fact generalizes to -norms in that the -norm of any given vector does not grow with :\n\nFor the opposite direction, the following relation between the 1-norm and the 2-norm is known:\n\nThis inequality depends on the dimension of the underlying vector space and follows directly from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.\n\nIn general, for vectors in where :\n\nIn for , the formula\n\ndefines an absolutely homogeneous function for ; however, the resulting function does not define a norm, because it is not subadditive. On the other hand, the formula\n\ndefines a subadditive function at the cost of losing absolute homogeneity. It does define an F-norm, though, which is homogeneous of degree .\n\nHence, the function\n\ndefines a metric. The metric space is denoted by ℓ.\n\nAlthough the -unit ball \"B\" around the origin in this metric is \"concave\", the topology defined on by the metric is the usual vector space topology of , hence ℓ is a locally convex topological vector space. Beyond this qualitative statement, a quantitative way to measure the lack of convexity of ℓ is to denote by the smallest constant such that the multiple \"C\" \"B\" of the -unit ball contains the convex hull of \"B\", equal to \"B\". The fact that for fixed we have\n\nshows that the infinite-dimensional sequence space defined below, is no longer locally convex.\n\nThere is one ℓ norm and another function called the ℓ \"norm\" (with quotation marks).\n\nThe mathematical definition of the ℓ norm was established by Banach's \"Theory of Linear Operations\". The space of sequences has a complete metric topology provided by the F-norm\n\nwhich is discussed by Stefan Rolewicz in \"Metric Linear Spaces\". The ℓ-normed space is studied in functional analysis, probability theory, and harmonic analysis.\n\nAnother function was called the ℓ \"norm\" by David Donoho—whose quotation marks warn that this function is not a proper norm—is the number of non-zero entries of the vector \"x\". Many authors abuse terminology by omitting the quotation marks. Defining , the zero \"norm\" of \"x\" is equal to\n\nThis is not a norm because it is not homogeneous. Despite these defects as a mathematical norm, the non-zero counting \"norm\" has uses in scientific computing, information theory, and statistics–notably in compressed sensing in signal processing and computational harmonic analysis.\n\nThe -norm can be extended to vectors that have an infinite number of components, which yields the space . This contains as special cases:\n\nThe space of sequences has a natural vector space structure by applying addition and scalar multiplication coordinate by coordinate. Explicitly, the vector sum and the scalar action for infinite sequences of real (or complex) numbers are given by:\n\nDefine the -norm:\n\nHere, a complication arises, namely that the series on the right is not always convergent, so for example, the sequence made up of only ones, , will have an infinite -norm for . The space is then defined as the set of all infinite sequences of real (or complex) numbers such that the -norm is finite.\n\nOne can check that as increases, the set grows larger. For example, the sequence\n\nis not in , but it is in for , as the series\n\ndiverges for (the harmonic series), but is convergent for .\n\nOne also defines the -norm using the supremum:\n\nand the corresponding space of all bounded sequences. It turns out that\n\nif the right-hand side is finite, or the left-hand side is infinite. Thus, we will consider spaces for .\n\nThe -norm thus defined on is indeed a norm, and together with this norm is a Banach space. The fully general space is obtained—as seen below — by considering vectors, not only with finitely or countably-infinitely many components, but with \"arbitrarily many components\"; in other words, functions. An integral instead of a sum is used to define the -norm.\n\nAn space may be defined as a space of functions for which the \"p\"-th power of the absolute value is Lebesgue integrable, where functions which agree almost everywhere are identified. More generally, let and be a measure space. Consider the set of all measurable functions from to or whose absolute value raised to the -th power has a finite integral, or equivalently, that\n\nThe set of such functions forms a vector space, with the following natural operations:\n\nfor every scalar .\n\nThat the sum of two -th power integrable functions is again -th power integrable follows from the inequality\n\nIn fact, more is true. \"Minkowski's inequality\" says the triangle inequality holds for . Thus the set of -th power integrable functions, together with the function , is a seminormed vector space, which is denoted by formula_25.\nThis can be made into a normed vector space in a standard way; one simply takes the quotient space with respect to the kernel of . Since for any measurable function , we have that if and only if almost everywhere, the kernel of does not depend upon ,\n\nIn the quotient space, two functions and are identified if almost everywhere. The resulting normed vector space is, by definition,\n\nFor , the space is defined as follows. We start with the set of all measurable functions from to or which are bounded. Again two such functions are identified if they are equal almost everywhere. Denote this set by . For a function in this set, the essential supremum of its absolute value serves as an appropriate norm:\n\nAs before, if there exists such that , then\n\nFor is a Banach space. The fact that is complete is often referred to as the Riesz-Fischer theorem. Completeness can be checked using the convergence theorems for Lebesgue integrals.\n\nWhen the underlying measure space is understood, is often abbreviated , or just . The above definitions generalize to Bochner spaces.\n\nSimilar to the spaces, is the only Hilbert space among spaces. In the complex case, the inner product on is defined by\n\nThe additional inner product structure allows for a richer theory, with applications to, for instance, Fourier series and quantum mechanics. Functions in are sometimes called quadratically integrable functions, square-integrable functions or square-summable functions, but sometimes these terms are reserved for functions that are square-integrable in some other sense, such as in the sense of a Riemann integral .\n\nIf we use complex-valued functions, the space is a commutative C*-algebra with pointwise multiplication and conjugation. For many measure spaces, including all sigma-finite ones, it is in fact a commutative von Neumann algebra. An element of defines a bounded operator on any space by multiplication.\n\nFor the spaces are a special case of spaces, when , and is the counting measure on . More generally, if one considers any set with the counting measure, the resulting space is denoted . For example, the space is the space of all sequences indexed by the integers, and when defining the -norm on such a space, one sums over all the integers. The space , where is the set with elements, is with its -norm as defined above. As any Hilbert space, every space is linearly isometric to a suitable , where the cardinality of the set is the cardinality of an arbitrary Hilbertian basis for this particular .\n\nThe dual space (the Banach space of all continuous linear functionals) of for has a natural isomorphism with , where is such that (i.e. formula_31). This isomorphism associates with the functional defined by\n\nThe fact that is well defined and continuous follows from Hölder's inequality. is a linear mapping which is an isometry by the extremal case of Hölder's inequality. It is also possible to show (for example with the Radon–Nikodym theorem, see) that any can be expressed this way: i.e., that is \"onto\". Since is onto and isometric, it is an isomorphism of Banach spaces. With this (isometric) isomorphism in mind, it is usual to say simply that is the dual Banach space of .\n\nFor , the space is reflexive. Let be as above and let be the corresponding linear isometry. Consider the map from to , obtained by composing with the transpose (or adjoint) of the inverse of :\n\nThis map coincides with the canonical embedding of into its bidual. Moreover, the map is onto, as composition of two onto isometries, and this proves reflexivity.\n\nIf the measure on is sigma-finite, then the dual of is isometrically isomorphic to (more precisely, the map corresponding to is an isometry from onto ).\n\nThe dual of is subtler. Elements of can be identified with bounded signed \"finitely\" additive measures on that are absolutely continuous with respect to . See ba space for more details. If we assume the axiom of choice, this space is much bigger than except in some trivial cases. However, Saharon Shelah proved that there are relatively consistent extensions of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF + DC + \"Every subset of the real numbers has the Baire property\") in which the dual of is .\n\nColloquially, if , then contains functions that are more locally singular, while elements of can be more spread out. Consider the Lebesgue measure on the half line . A continuous function in might blow up near 0 but must decay sufficiently fast toward infinity. On the other hand, continuous functions in need not decay at all but no blow-up is allowed. The precise technical result is the following. Suppose that . Then:\n\n\nNeither condition holds for the real line with the Lebesgue measure. In both cases the embedding is continuous, in that the identity operator is a bounded linear map from\nand to in the second.\n(This is a consequence of the closed graph theorem\nand properties of spaces.) Indeed, if the domain has finite measure,\none can make the following explicit calculation using Hölder's inequality\n\nleading to\n\nThe constant appearing in the above inequality is optimal, in the sense that the operator norm of the identity is precisely\n\nthe case of equality being achieved exactly when -a.e.\n\nThroughout this section we assume that: .\n\nLet be a measure space. An \"integrable simple function\" on is one of the form\n\nwhere is scalar, has finite measure and formula_39 is the indicator function of the set formula_40, for . By construction of the integral, the vector space of integrable simple functions is dense in .\n\nMore can be said when is a metrizable topological space and its Borel –algebra, i.e., the smallest –algebra of subsets of containing the open sets.\n\nSuppose is an open set with . It can be proved that for every Borel set contained in , and for every , there exist a closed set and an open set such that\n\nIt follows that there exists continuous on such that\n\nIf can be covered by an increasing sequence of open sets that have finite measure, then the space of –integrable continuous functions is dense in . More precisely, one can use bounded continuous functions that vanish outside one of the open sets .\n\nThis applies in particular when and when is the Lebesgue measure. The space of continuous and compactly supported functions is dense in . Similarly, the space of integrable \"step functions\" is dense in ; this space is the linear span of indicator functions of bounded intervals when , of bounded rectangles when and more generally of products of bounded intervals.\n\nSeveral properties of general functions in are first proved for continuous and compactly supported functions (sometimes for step functions), then extended by density to all functions. For example, it is proved this way that translations are continuous on , in the following sense:\n\nwhere\nLet be a measure space. If , then can be defined as above: it is the vector space of those measurable functions such that\n\nAs before, we may introduce the -norm , but does not satisfy the triangle inequality in this case, and defines only a quasi-norm. The inequality , valid for implies that \n\nand so the function\n\nis a metric on . The resulting metric space is complete; the verification is similar to the familiar case when .\n\nIn this setting satisfies a \"reverse Minkowski inequality\", that is for in \n\nThis result may be used to prove Clarkson's inequalities, which are in turn used to establish the uniform convexity of the spaces for .\n\nThe space for is an F-space: it admits a complete translation-invariant metric with respect to which the vector space operations are continuous. It is also locally bounded, much like the case . It is the prototypical example of an F-space that, for most reasonable measure spaces, is not locally convex: in or , every open convex set containing the function is unbounded for the -quasi-norm; therefore, the vector does not possess a fundamental system of convex neighborhoods. Specifically, this is true if the measure space contains an infinite family of disjoint measurable sets of finite positive measure.\n\nThe only nonempty convex open set in is the entire space . As a particular consequence, there are no nonzero linear functionals on : the dual space is the zero space. In the case of the counting measure on the natural numbers (producing the sequence space ), the bounded linear functionals on are exactly those that are bounded on , namely those given by sequences in . Although does contain non-trivial convex open sets, it fails to have enough of them to give a base for the topology.\n\nThe situation of having no linear functionals is highly undesirable for the purposes of doing analysis. In the case of the Lebesgue measure on , rather than work with for , it is common to work with the Hardy space whenever possible, as this has quite a few linear functionals: enough to distinguish points from one another. However, the Hahn–Banach theorem still fails in for .\n\nThe vector space of (equivalence classes of) measurable functions on is denoted . By definition, it contains all the , and is equipped with the topology of \"convergence in measure\". When is a probability measure (i.e., ), this mode of convergence is named \"convergence in probability\".\n\nThe description is easier when is finite. If is a finite measure on , the function admits for the convergence in measure the following fundamental system of neighborhoods\n\nThe topology can be defined by any metric of the form\n\nwhere is bounded continuous concave and non-decreasing on , with and when (for example, . Such a metric is called Lévy-metric for . Under this metric the space is complete (it is again an F-space). The space is in general not locally bounded, and not locally convex.\n\nFor the infinite Lebesgue measure on , the definition of the fundamental system of neighborhoods could be modified as follows\n\nThe resulting space coincides as topological vector space with , for any positive –integrable density .\n\nLet (\"S\", \"Σ\", \"μ\") be a measure space, and \"f\" a measurable function with real or complex values on \"S\". The distribution function of \"f\" is defined for \"t\" > 0 by\n\nIf \"f\" is in \"L\"(\"S\", \"μ\") for some \"p\" with 1 ≤ \"p\" < ∞, then by Markov's inequality,\n\nA function \"f\" is said to be in the space weak \"L\"(\"S\", \"μ\"), or \"L\"(\"S\", \"μ\"), if there is a constant \"C\" > 0 such that, for all \"t\" > 0,\n\nThe best constant \"C\" for this inequality is the \"L\"-norm of \"f\", and is denoted by\n\nThe weak \"L\" coincide with the Lorentz spaces \"L\", so this notation is also used to denote them.\n\nThe \"L\"-norm is not a true norm, since the triangle inequality fails to hold. Nevertheless, for \"f\" in \"L\"(\"S\", \"μ\"),\nand in particular \"L\"(\"S\", \"μ\") ⊂ \"L\"(\"S\", \"μ\"). \n\nIn fact, one has\n\nformula_57,\n\nand raising to power formula_58 and taking the supremum in formula_59 one has\n\nformula_60.\n\nUnder the convention that two functions are equal if they are equal \"μ\" almost everywhere, then the spaces \"L\" are complete .\n\nFor any 0 < \"r\" < \"p\" the expression\nis comparable to the \"L\"-norm. Further in the case \"p\" > 1, this expression defines a norm if \"r\" = 1. Hence for \"p\" > 1 the weak \"L\" spaces are Banach spaces .\n\nA major result that uses the \"L\"-spaces is the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem, which has broad applications to harmonic analysis and the study of singular integrals.\n\nAs before, consider a measure space . Let be a measurable function. The -weighted space is defined as , where means the measure defined by\n\nor, in terms of the Radon–Nikodym derivative, the norm for is explicitly\n\nAs -spaces, the weighted spaces have nothing special, since is equal to . But they are the natural framework for several results in harmonic analysis ; they appear for example in the Muckenhoupt theorem: for , the classical Hilbert transform is defined on where denotes the unit circle and the Lebesgue measure; the (nonlinear) Hardy–Littlewood maximal operator is bounded on . Muckenhoupt's theorem describes weights such that the Hilbert transform remains bounded on and the maximal operator on .\n\nOne may also define spaces on a manifold, called the intrinsic spaces of the manifold, using densities.\n\n\n"}

She was a founding member of the Sąjūdis, a political organization which advocated for the independence of Lithuania from the Soviet Union during the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nLukšienė originates from a famous family active in the Lithuanian culture. She obtained her formal education in inter-war period in Lithuania – in 1931 graduated from Vilnius Vytautas Magnus Gymnasium, in 1942 graduated from the Humanitarian Faculty at Kaunas Vytautas Magnus University, obtained Lithuanian literature history speciality (major) and Lithuanian language critic, French literature, Pedagogics specialities (subsidiary). Lukšienė defended two dissertations: of humanitarian science and doctor habilitatus in social science (sphere of education science).\nA home of Meilė Lukšienė was full of great respect for the human idea, perception, consciousness and inquiring mind. Her husband Kazimieras Lukša (1906–1983) in the independent Republic of Lithuania was a high economic relations officer, high-level Lithuanian bank employee. From 1940 to 1970 Kazimieras Lukša had been teaching the science of balance, economic analysis and international trade courses at Vilnius University. From 1945 to 1946 he was a dean of the faculty of economics. They brought up three children: Dr. Hab. of history Ingė Lukšaitė, the organist Giedrė Lukšaitė-Mrázková, who is a professor of the faculty of music of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague and a son Rimtis Lukša, who is a doctor of Natural Sciences.\n\nProfessional activities\n\nLukšienė is an author and co-author of numerous educational publications and educational strategic documents, she was employed as a teacher, university educator, and during 1951–1958 was a head of the Lithuanian Literature Department of Vilnius University. Lukšienė was accused of nationalism and anti-Soviet standpoint and was dismissed from the university, deprived of right to conduct research on literature. In year 1959 she was employed at Pedagogics (Education) Science Research Institute as a senior research fellow and served there until 1997.\n\nIn 1988 Lukšienė, being one of the most outstanding authorities among the Lithuanian scholars, was elected a member of initiative group of the emerging Reform Movement of Lithuania – Sąjūdis – the one to turn into the most important power of Lithuania to restore the independent statehood in 1990. She rallied a group of Lithuania Republic Education Reform, acted as one of the most important creators of the first independent Concept of Lithuanian Education and the related education documents. She nourished the young generation of education science scholars and the managers of education. She paid immense attention to the education principles new to the Lithuanian society – humanism, democracy, national identity – their introduction and dissemination at public discussions and the mass media, the interrelations between the education and culture. The scientist made every effort to raise many gifted education managers and scientists involved in the development of practical educational change strategies that meet the democratic aspirations of education.\n\nAwards\n\nIn year 1989 Meilė Lukšienė was awarded the title of emeritus scientific actor. In 1994 – the 5th Class Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas. In 2003 she was awarded the Great Cross of the Knight Commander of Vytautas Magnus. In 2004 Meilė Lukšienė was awarded the Jan Amos COMENIUS UNESCO medal for her personal contribution in the scientific and practical fortifying education as the basis of creating the state. The significance of her works proves M. Lukšienė to be a scholar of European orientation and global level; a personality, who has significantly contributed to the development of democratic society and modern education and in 2007 she was given an Honourable award by the Ministry of Education and Science.\n\nMeilė Lukšienė was the first in Lithuania to scientifically base the methodology of democratic education based both on historical and the contemporary development aspects. Her scientific creations are characterised by the integral humanitarian and social sciences principle, which continues its immense impact on the education theory science development.\n\nThe scholar related the development of Lithuanian pedagogical thought with the general issues of the national culture. Thus her investigations were distinguished for their culturology aspects and extensive viewpoint. Her scientific works were conducted on the verge of three fields of science – pedagogy, literature and culturology, and surpassed the prevailing investigations of those times, concentrated on the narrow specific issues of school system, didactics. \nMeilė Lukšienė raised essential questions of the orientation of the Lithuanian education system, namely: ratio of nationality and universality; education of cultural identity; continuation of the cultural tradition and modernization of education; social justice. Then she formulated the ideal of education, which served as basis for the new content of education at school: a person who is moral, active citizen, independent thinker, creative and able to intake a variety of cultural values and act in a constructive way. The public discussions of these topics turned into an important factor of the change of pedagogic mentality and the overall mentality of the society.\nA valuable trait of M. Lukšienė was her ability to get and embrace the newest information from a variety of sources, analyse the Western Europe education systems and the tendencies of their development, the newest ideas of education science, and to foresee the ways of their application in Lithuanian context. Meilė Lukšienė was able to communicate, to read in several languages – the Lithuanian, Polish, French, Russian, and German, thus was non-formally, intensively learning from a variety of sources of literature worldwide. Meilė Lukšienė had a characteristic deep systems-oriented thinking. In all investigations conducted she considered the independent education system to be among the guarantees of statehood, while the presence of direction, purpose and capacity to embrace all possible layers of the society by the education system – one of the conditions for successful existence of the state.\n\nMeilė Lukšienė merited a lot as during the restoration of Lithuanian independence in year 1990 Lithuanian education met already having a conceptual Europe-orientated future education model. It was used as a basis to create the General Concept of Education in Lithuania (1992), which delineated the directions of the national education system development. The essential education principles chosen were humanism, democracy, national identity and renewal. The theoretical basis for education development the humanistic education paradigm, the holistic education concept was chosen. The education system was based on European culture values – personal worth, natural equality of people, freedom of consciousness, tolerance, democratic relations within society. The education was titled as the basic factor of the society development, the fundament of all social reforms, thus a task was formulated to overtake the general development of the society and be its leader. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) experts in year 1999 assessed the Lithuanian education and admitted that in Lithuania does exist a solid conceptual basis for reforms (“There is a strong conceptual foundation for reforms”) and Lithuania presents the best example of the major document – the General Concept of Education in Lithuania of 1992 – its creation and development. The main author of these works is Dr. Hab. Meilė Lukšienė. \nIn her public and educational activities Meilė Lukšienė always was distinctive by her faith that a person has capacity to change oneself and his/her social cultural environment towards humanism. By her overall activities she modelled not only education, but also the future of the state – a modern Lithuanian nation, open society, democratic state. She considered the education of a competent person for a democratic state to be among the major goals of education. Besides, the researcher always considered competence to be not the narrow professional qualifications of the subject matter, but the overall readiness to actively operate in a society, be responsible for the life in the society, create its culture, to regularly react to the challenges of the development in the world and its changes, thus get ready for lifelong learning. \nThe approach of M. Lukšienė is in special resound with European and global orientation of education of the 21st century and the goals of educational systems.\n\nThe significance of her works proves M.

{"id": "844911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=844911", "title": "Merism", "text": "Merism\n\nIn law, a merism is a figure of speech by which a single thing is referred to by a conventional phrase that enumerates several of its parts or lists several synonyms for the same thing.\n\nIn rhetoric, a merism is the combination of two contrasting words to refer to an entirety. For example, to say that someone searched everywhere, an expression is that someone \"searched high and low\". The title of the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons is also a merism and refers to its fantasy theme. Another example of a merism is the sword-and-sandal movie genre, a loose term for movies made until 1970 set in Classical antiquity.\n\nMerisms also figure in a number of familiar English expressions. The phrase \"lock, stock, and barrel\" originally referred to the most conspicuous parts of a gun and has now come to refer to the whole of anything that has constituent parts.\n\nIn biology, a merism is a repetition of similar parts in the structure of an organism (Bateson 1894). Such features are called meristic characters, and the study of such characters is called meristics.\n\nMerisms are conspicuous features of Biblical poetry. For example, in Genesis 1:1, when God creates \"the heavens and the earth\" (King James Version), the two parts combined indicate that God created the whole universe. Similarly, in Psalm 139, the psalmist declares that God knows \"my downsitting and mine uprising\" to indicate that God knows all the psalmist's actions. In addition, Genesis 1:5 uses \"evening\" and \"morning\" as a merism for \"one day\".\n\nThe term entered English in 1894 in the biological sense, but had appeared earlier in rhetorical contexts where it denoted \"'synecdoche in which totality is expressed by contrasting parts' (such as \"high and low\", \"young and old\")\". It derives from Modern Latin \"merismus\", from Greek \"merismos\" 'a dividing or partitioning', ultimately from \"merizein\" 'to divide', from \"meros\" 'part, share'.\n\nMerisms frequently figure in the writing of lawyers, and are a hallmark of legal style. The two parts of the legal merism \"Last Will and Testament\" at one time referred to two documents, enforced in two separate courts: the \"will\" disposed of a decedent's real property while the \"testament\" disposed of chattels. It became customary to combine the instruments in a single dispositive document, and the name has continued long after the doctrines that required its use became obsolete in common law.\n\nA lawyer who writes a will typically includes a residuary clause that disposes of any property not covered by a prior section. The weight of tradition is such that the lawyer writing such a document will often phrase it something like this:\n\nTraditionally, a gift of real property was called a \"devise\" whereas a gift of other property was a \"bequest\". Nowadays, the words \"bequeath\" and \"devise\" are synonymous in most jurisdictions so that \"I bequeath the rest of my property to ...\" is enough in both law and logic to achieve the same result. The entire phrase is an elaborate merism. Many deeds frequently contain a traditional clause that says that the grantee is \"to have and to hold\" the property conveyed; this usage goes back to the days in which the instruments were drawn up in Latin, and is sometimes called a \"habendam et tenendam\" clause. The use of legal merisms seldom if ever adds legal effect to the document that contains them, and frequently increases their reading difficulty. However, the weight of tradition and the fear that a deviation from the established formula might have unintended legal consequences makes lawyers reluctant to revise the traditional formulae, and their clients, seeing them, at least draw the satisfaction of knowing that their documents appear to be written by a lawyer.\n\nIn some cases, the doubling, or even tripling, of constituent parts in these meristic constructions arose as a result of the transition of legal discourse from Latin to French, and then from French to English. During such periods, in an attempt to prevent ambiguity and ensure hermeneutic consistency, key terms were paired with synonyms from multiple languages.\n\n\n"}

Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films, etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry. Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and asides. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.\n\nMonologues are similar to poems, epiphanies, and others, in that, they involve one 'voice' speaking but there are differences between them. For example, a soliloquy involves a character relating his or her thoughts and feelings to him/herself and to the audience without addressing any of the other characters. A monologue is the thoughts of a person spoken out loud. Monologues are also distinct from apostrophes, in which the speaker or writer addresses an imaginary person, inanimate object, or idea. Asides differ from each of these not only in length (asides are shorter) but also in that asides are not heard by other characters even in situations where they logically should be (e.g. two characters engaging in a dialogue interrupted by one of them delivering an aside).\n\nIn ancient Greek theatre, the origin of western drama, the conventional three actor rule was preceded by a two actor rule, which was itself preceded by a convention in which only a single actor would appear on stage, along with the chorus. The origin of the monologue as a dramatic device, therefore, is not rooted in dialogue. It is, instead, the other way around; dialogue evolved from monologue.\n\nAncient Roman theatre featured monologues extensively, more commonly than either Ancient Greek theatre or modern theatre. One of the key purposes of these monologues was to indicate the passage of significant amounts of time (that would be tedious to actually play out in real time) within scenes. This type of monologue is referred to as a linking monologue. Other monologue types included \"entrance monologues\" and exit monologues. In each of these cases a primary function is indicating the passage of time.\n\nFrom Renaissance theatre onward, monologues generally focused on characters using the extended speech to pursue their dramatic need. Postmodern theatre, on the other hand, often embraces the performative aspects of the monologue, even to the point of challenging the boundary between character portrayal (e.g. acting) and autobiographical speeches.\n\nInterior monologues involve a character externalizing their thoughts so that the audience can witness experiences that would otherwise be mostly internal. In contrast, a dramatic monologue involves one character speaking to another character. Monologues can also be divided along the lines of active and narrative monologues. In an active monologue a character is using their speech to achieve a clear goal. Narrative monologues simply involve a character telling a story and can often be identified by the fact that they are in the past tense.\n\nActors in theatre, and sometimes in film and television, may be asked to deliver monologues in auditions. Audition monologues demonstrate an actor's ability to prepare a piece and deliver a performance. These pieces are usually limited to two minutes or less and are often paired with a contrasting monologue: comic and dramatic; classical and contemporary. The choice of monologues for an audition often depends on the play or role. The audition monologue is a rite of passage with theatre actors.\n\n\n\nContemporary Monologues from Published Plays - Monologue Blogger\n"}

For the purpose of this article the acronym MSIP will be used exclusively to refer to the multi-subject instructional period.\n\nThe Manitoba School Improvement Project dates from 1991, when it was established as a result of the vision of the Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation, a Canadian charitable foundation. The Foundation was interested in enhancing education for \"students at risk\" and needed a province with an educational community that would welcome and support their involvement. The Province of Manitoba met their criteria and a pilot program was begun. Established initially with a very definite urban focus, the program has in recent years expanded to not only include the province's rural community but other Canadian jurisdictions. \n\nMSIP promotes an alternative academic schedule for high school students. Students in Canada generally attend high schools where the school year is divided into two semesters consisting of four period days. Class time can vary slightly but most classes last between 70 and 76 minutes. Instead of the standard four 75-minute periods found in the semestered school MSIP schools adopt five 60-minute periods including one 60-minute multi-subject instructional period.\n\nStudents attend their regular four classes each day plus a one-hour supervised MSIP class. Students in any one MSIP class are arranged in multi-grade formation with varied levels of ability. Their course selections determine their timetable and where the MSIP class will fall. In many cases the MSIP class begins with 20 minutes of silent literacy work - reading or writing complimenting the movement to improve literacy skills. The rest of the period students may use for work on assignments, make up work they missed due to absences or get help in areas where they are falling behind.\nStudents have the ability to move within the school environment during their MSIP period to seek extra help, use computer and research resources, attend guidance counselling appointments and meet with subject teachers where possible. The flexibility of this format alleviates the disruption normally associated with the typical semesterted schedule.\n\nResources: MSIP increases students’ access to learning resources. During their MSIP, students are allowed to travel to an area like a computer lab to do research, to a science lab to complete an assignment, or see a teacher for academic support. MSIP schools report\nthat on any given period approximately 5% of students travel to an area outside of the\nMSIP class. Schools experiencing timetabling difficulties due to a shortage of lab space and gymnasium facilities have in effect created more facility opportunities with this 5 period system.\nTimetable Conflicts: One of the early goals of the MSIP schedule was to deal with the increased number of conflicts students were experiencing in a shrinking school. Having 5 slots to place classes reduces the probability of class overlaps.\n\nStudies of existing MSIP schools show improvement in students' inductive thinking abilities, improved group interactions skills and an improvement in students’ abilities to memorize information. For many non-academic students MSIP also provides shorter classes making it easier for students to focus and complete homework in their MSIP class before going home.\nStudent-Centered Learning is a by-product of the MSIP period. The MSIP format demands that students be self-directed and organized each day by creating an environment of student autonomy - students are in charge of their own agenda. Homework, research and even group meetings are scheduled by the student during their MSIP period. This results in an increased level of responsibility and ownership over their own learning. \n\nMastering Learning: Research emphasizes the need for “do time” for consolidation of learning; MSIP provides this time. Each day students will have 60 minutes of ‘do time’ to complete homework, prepare for tests, and work on projects and assignments. This time will promote ‘mastering’ learning and prepare students to learn new concepts and skills, thus improving overall performance.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41585725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41585725", "title": "Project Cybersyn", "text": "Project Cybersyn\n\nProject Cybersyn was a Chilean project from 1971–1973 during the presidency of Salvador Allende aimed at constructing a distributed decision support system to aid in the management of the national economy. The project consisted of four modules: an economic simulator, custom software to check factory performance, an operations room, and a national network of telex machines that were linked to one mainframe computer.\n\nProject Cybersyn was based on viable system model theory and a neural network approach to organizational design, and featured innovative technology for its time: it included a network of telex machines (\"Cybernet\") in state-run enterprises that would transmit and receive information with the government in Santiago. Information from the field would be fed into statistical modeling software (\"Cyberstride\") that would monitor production indicators (such as raw material supplies or high rates of worker absenteeism) in real time, and alert the workers in the first case, and in abnormal situations also the central government, if those parameters fell outside acceptable ranges. The information would also be input into economic simulation software (\"CHECO\", for CHilean ECOnomic simulator) that the government could use to forecast the possible outcome of economic decisions. Finally, a sophisticated operations room (\"Opsroom\") would provide a space where managers could see relevant economic data, formulate responses to emergencies, and transmit advice and directives to enterprises and factories in alarm situations by using the telex network.\n\nThe principal architect of the system was British operations research scientist Stafford Beer, and the system embodied his notions of organisational cybernetics in industrial management. One of its main objectives was to devolve decision-making power within industrial enterprises to their workforce in order to develop self-regulation of factories.\n\nThe project's name in English (Cybersyn) is a portmanteau of the words \"cybernetics\" and \"synergy\". Since the name is not euphonic in Spanish, in that language the project was called \"Synco\", both an initialism for the Spanish \"Sistema de INformación y COntrol\", \"system of information and control\", and a pun on the Spanish \"cinco\", the number five, alluding to the five levels of Beer's viable system model.\n\nStafford Beer was a British consultant in management cybernetics. He also sympathized with the stated ideals of Chilean socialism of maintaining Chile's democratic system and the autonomy of workers instead of imposing a Soviet-style system of top-down command and control.\n\nIn July 1971, Fernando Flores, a high-level employee of the Chilean Production Development Corporation (CORFO) contacted Beer for advice on incorporating Beer's theories into the management of the newly nationalized sector of Chile's economy. Beer saw this as a unique opportunity to implement his ideas on a national scale. More than offering advice, he left most of his other consulting business and devoted much time to what became Project Cybersyn. He traveled to Chile often to collaborate with local implementors and used his personal contacts to secure help from British technical experts.\n\nThe implementation schedule was very aggressive, and the system had reached an advanced prototype stage at the start of 1973.\n\nThe system was most useful in October 1972, when about 40,000 striking truck drivers blocked the access streets that converged towards Santiago. According to Gustavo Silva (executive secretary of energy in CORFO), the system's telex machines helped organize the transport of resources into the city with only about 200 trucks driven by strike-breakers, lessening the potential damage caused by the 40,000 striking truck drivers.\n\nAfter the CIA-backed military coup on September 11, 1973, Cybersyn was abandoned and the operations room was destroyed.\n\nThere were 500 unused telex machines bought by the previous government. Each was put into one factory. In the control centre in Santiago, each day data coming from each factory (several numbers, such as raw material input, production output and number of absentees) were put into a computer, which made short-term predictions and necessary adjustments. There were four levels of control (firm, branch, sector, total), with algedonic feedback. If one level of control did not remedy a problem in a certain interval, the higher level was notified. The results were discussed in the operations room and a top-level plan was made.\n\nThe software for Cybersyn was called \"Cyberstride\", and used Bayesian filtering and Bayesian control. It was written by Chilean engineers in consultation with a team of 12 British programmers.\n\nThe futuristic operations room was designed by a team led by the interface designer Gui Bonsiepe. It was furnished with seven swivel chairs (considered the best for creativity) with buttons, which were designed to control several large screens that could project the data, and other panels with status information, although these were of limited functionality as they could only show pre-prepared graphs. This consisted of slides.\n\nThe vision had been distribution of control and involvement of workers in business planning. The design looked more like bureaucratic centralisation of control via bottom up reporting and top-down direction. Workers were expected to perform processes and use resources in the ways that had been modelled and planned. Any significant deviation from was to be reported upwards, and corrective directives were to be cascaded downwards.\n\nThe project is described in some detail in the second edition of Strafford Beer's books \"Brain of the Firm\" and \"Platform for Change\". The latter book includes proposals for social innovations such as having representatives of diverse 'stakeholder' groups into the control centre.\n\nThe Ops room used Tulip chairs similar to those used in the American science fiction TV programme \"Star Trek\", although according to the designers, the style was not influenced by science fiction movies.\n\nComputer scientist Paul Cockshott and economist Alvin Cottrell referenced Project Cybersyn in their 1993 book \"Towards a New Socialism\", citing it as an inspiration for their own proposed model of economic planning under socialism.\n\nChilean science fiction author Jorge Baradit published a Spanish-language science fiction novel \"Synco\" in 2008. It is an alternate history science fantasy novel set in a 1979, of which he said: \"It stops the military coup, the socialist government consolidates and creates the first cybernetic state, a universal example, the true third way, a miracle.\"\n\n\n"}

Parallel to \"wenren\" are two terms, \"shi\"(Chinese:士), scholar, and \"shen\"(Chinese:绅), often defined as gentry or official. \n\nEvery literati was required to take three tests, and those who achieved the lower degree in the civil services examination could get a spot in the village. These people were called \"shengyuan\" (Chinese:生员, literally \"born official\"). Those who pass the second test have a chance to take the third test - known as the highest test - held in Beijing every three years. The people who pass this final test can get a degree called \"jinshi\" () which is the highest level a literati may reach.\n\nThe Qing education system is mostly derived from Confucianist. It includes \"Four Books and Five Classics\"(Chinese: 四書五經; pinyin: Sìshū wǔjīng). Generally, people begin their studies when they are very young and attempt to pass three tests throughout their lives. Scholars who pass the Imperial examination obtain the \"Jinshi\" degree and have a chance to make it into the central Government. The dynastic school system was limited to candidates who spoke Mandarin (Guanhua Chinese:官话, i.e., the language of officials in the capitals), and could read and write classical Chinese. Dynastic schools were oriented toward examination preparation. Initial stages of training for the civil service became the private responsibility of lineages seeking to attain or maintain elite gentry status. The civil examination represented the focal point through which imperial interests, family strategies and individual hopes and aspirations were directed.\n\nCivil examinations mediated the classical discourse of \"way learning\" and literati into everyday lives. Tensions, which brought a few fame and fortune, left most dealing with disappointment. Literati often turned to religion and the manic arts to channel their responses to the competitive examination. Those who failed the civil examinations often mocked the selection process in popular novels, such as Wu Jingzi's (1701-1754) \"The Scholars\", and vernacular stories by Pu Songling (1640-1715). Such narratives framed the examination process from the angle of the failures. Such works appealed to both elites and non-elites. Recorded dreams and auspicious events were manifested in nonofficial accounts of the examination candidates, which the public used for explaining their individual success or failure.\n\nExamination success usually meant career success, but what success meant in terms of careers changed dramatically from Ming to Qing. All but palace degree-holders were down-classed by the late Ming, while in the Qing even palace degree-holders frequently had to wait years to gain an appointment as a magistrate or prefect once they passed in the bottom tier. Social prestige, legal privileges and corvée labor exemptions kept most commoner families from competing in the examination market. The diminishing opportunities for examination success by the nineteenth century exacerbated human frailties. No earlier dynasty ever faced a demographic expansion commensurate with the Qing, from 250 million in 1650 to 350 million by 1800.\n\n"}
{"id": "20734598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20734598", "title": "Short story cycle", "text": "Short story cycle\n\nA short story cycle (sometimes referred to as a story sequence or composite novel) is a collection of short stories in which the narratives are specifically composed and arranged with the goal of creating an enhanced or different experience when reading the group as a whole as opposed to its individual parts. Short story cycles are different from novels because the parts that would make up the chapters can all stand alone as a short story, each individually containing a beginning, middle and conclusion. When read as a group there is a tension created between the ideas of the individual stories, often showing changes that have occurred over time or highlighting the conflict between two opposing concepts or thoughts. Because of this dynamic, the stories need to have an awareness of what the other stories accomplish; therefore, cycles are usually written with the expressed purpose to create a cycle as opposed to being gathered and arranged later.\n\nScholars have pointed out that there is a wide range of possibilities that fall between simple collections and novels in their most-commonly understood form. One question is how well the stories stand up individually: chapters of a novel usually cannot stand alone, whereas stories in collections are meant to be fully independent. But many books have combined stories in such a way that the stories have varying degrees of interdependence, and it is these variations that cause problems in definition. Maggie Dunn and Ann Morris, for instance, claim that the stories in a \"story cycle\" are more independent than those in a \"composite novel\", and James Nagel points out that both \"cycle\" and \"sequence\" are misleading, since \"cycle\" implies circularity and \"sequence\" implies temporal linearity, neither of which he finds to be essential to most such collections. Rolf Lundén has suggested four types of cycles, in order of decreasing unity: the \"cycle\", in which the ending resolves the conflicts brought up at the beginning (e.g., \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\"); the \"sequence\", in which each story is linked to the ones before it but without a cumulative story that ties everything together (e.g., \"The Unvanquished\"); the \"cluster\", in which the links between stories are not always made obvious and in which the discontinuity between them is more significant than their unity (e.g., \"Go Down, Moses\"); and the \"novella\", in the classical sense of a collection of unrelated stories brought together by a frame story and a narrator(s) (e.g., \"Winesburg, Ohio\").[All examples are Lundén's] Robert M. Luscher compares and contrasts the short story cycle and science fiction short stories combined into longer fixups.\n\nIn their study of the genre, Maggie Dunn and Ann Morris note that the form descends from two different traditions: There are texts that are themselves assembled from other texts, such as the way the tales from the Arthurian cycle is compiled in books by Chretien de Troyes, Wolfram von Eschenbach, Thomas Malory and the \"Mabinogion\". Then there are the classic serialized novellas, many of them with frame stories; this genre includes \"One Thousand and One Nights\", \"The Decameron\", \"The Canterbury Tales\", etc. Dunn and Morris show how in the nineteenth century, the genre appeared in such forms as the village sketch collection (e.g., \"Our Village\") and the patchwork collection (e.g., Louisa May Alcott's \"Aunt Jo's Scrap-Bag\").\n\nJ. Gerald Kennedy describes the proliferation of the genre in the twentieth century, attributing it in part to the desire \"to renounce the organizing authority of an omniscient narrator, asserting instead a variety of voices or perspectives reflective of the radical subjectivity of modern experience. Kennedy finds this proliferation in keeping with modernism and its use of fragmentation, juxtaposition and simultaneism to reflect what the \"multiplicity\" that characterizes the century. Scholars such as James Nagel and Rocío G. Davis have pointed out that the story cycle has been very popular among ethnic U.S. authors. Davis argues that ethnic writers find the format useful \"as a metaphor for the fragmentation and multiplicity of ethnic lives\" insofar as it highights \"the subjectivity of experience and understanding\" by allowing \"multiple impressionistic perspectives and fragmentation of simple linear history\".\n\nDunn and Morris list several methods that authors use to provide unity to the collection as a whole. It has to be noted that these organising principles pertain to their theory of the composite novel as a short story collection where the focus lies on the coherent whole.

A practitioner of thaumaturgy is a \"thaumaturgus\", \"thaumaturge\", \"thaumaturgist\" or \"miracle worker\".\n\nThaumaturgy (), is from Greek \"thaûma\", meaning \"miracle\" or \"marvel\" and \"érgon\", meaning \"work\".\n\nIn the introduction of his translation of the \"Spiritual Powers (神通 \"Jinzū\")\" chapter of Dōgen's Shōbōgenzō, Carl Bielefel refers to the powers developed by adepts of Buddhist meditation as belonging to the \"thaumaturgical tradition\".\n\nIn original Greek writings, the term \"thaumaturge\" referred to several Christian saints. The word is usually translated into English as \"wonderworker\": a saint through whom God works miracles, not just occasionally, but as a matter of course. It was even said that God raises up not more than one every century. Famous ancient Christian thaumaturges include Saint Gregory of Neocaesarea, also known as Saint Gregory Thaumaturgus (c. 213–270), Saint Menas of Egypt (285 – c. 309), Saint Nicholas of Myra (270–343), Saint Anthony of Padua (1195–1231), Saint Philomena ( 300 (?)), \nSaint Ambrose of Optina (1812–1891), Saint Gerard Majella (1726–1755) and Saint John of Kronstadt (1829–1908). The Carmelite Bishop of Fiesole, Saint Andrew Corsini (1302–1373), was also called a thaumaturge during his lifetime. \n\nKings of France and England were also called thaumaturges, as they were traditionally considered able to heal scrofula.\n\nGodman is a colloquial term used in India for a type of charismatic guru. They usually have a high-profile presence, and are capable of attracting attention and support from large sections of the society. Godmen also sometimes claim to possess paranormal powers, such as the ability to heal, the ability to see or influence future events, and the ability to read minds.\n\nMiracle in the Qur'an can be defined as a supernatural intervention in the life of human beings. According to this definition, miracles are present \"in a threefold sense: in sacred history, in connection with the Islamic prophet Muhammad himself and in relation to revelation\". The Qur'an does not use the technical Arabic word for miracle (\"Muʿdjiza\") literally meaning \"that by means of which [the Prophet] confounds, overwhelms, his opponents\". It rather uses the term \"Ayah\" (literally meaning sign). The term \"Ayah\" is used in the Qur'an in the above mentioned threefold sense: it refers to the \"verses\" of the Qur'an (believed to be the divine speech in human language; presented by Muhammad as his chief miracle); as well as to miracles of it and the signs (particularly those of creation).\n\nIn the 16th century, the word \"thaumaturgy\" entered the English language meaning miraculous or magical powers. The word was first anglicized and used in the magical sense in John Dee's book \"Mathematicall Praeface to Euclid's Elements\" (1570). He mentions an \"art mathematical\" called \"thaumaturgy... which giveth certain order to make strange works, of the sense to be perceived and of men greatly to be wondered at\".\n\nIn Dee's time, \"the Mathematicks\" referred not merely to the abstract computations associated with the term today, but to physical mechanical devices which employed mathematical principles in their design. These devices, operated by means of compressed air, springs, strings, pulleys or levers, were seen by unsophisticated people (who did not understand their working principles) as magical devices which could only have been made with the aid of demons and devils.\n\nBy building such mechanical devices, Dee earned a reputation as a conjurer \"dreaded\" by neighborhood children. He complained of this assessment in his \"Mathematicall Praeface\": \"And for these, and such like marvellous Actes and Feates, Naturally, and Mechanically, wrought and contrived: ought any honest Student and Modest Christian Philosopher, be counted, & called a Conjurer? Shall the folly of Idiotes, and the Malice of the Scornfull, so much prevaille ... Shall that man, be (in hugger mugger) condemned, as a Companion of the hellhoundes, and a Caller, and Conjurer of wicked and damned Spirites?\"\n\nIn the Hermetic Qabalah mystical tradition, a person titled a magician has the power to make subtle changes in higher realms, which in turn produce physical results. For instance, if a Magician made slight changes in the world of formation (Olam Yetzirah), such as within the Sefirah of Yesod upon which Malkuth (the material realm) is based and within which all former Sefirot are brought together, then these alterations would appear in the world of action (\"Olam Assiah\").\n\nIn his book, \"The Gift of Death\", deconstructionist philosopher Jacques Derrida refers to philosophy as thaumaturgy. The idea is taken from the fifth essay of Jan Patočka's work, \"Heretical Essays in the History of Philosophy\" Derrida's reading is based on a deconstruction of the origin of the concepts of responsibility, faith, and gift.\n\nThe term thaumaturgy is used in various novels and games as a synonym for magic, a particular sub-school (often mechanical) of magic, or as the \"science\" of magic.\n\n\n\n"}

Nearly all infants exhibit a swallowing pattern involving tongue protrusion, but by six months of age most lose this reflex allowing for the ingestion of solid foods.\n\nSince 1958, the term \"tongue thrust\" has been described and discussed in speech and dental publications by many writers. Many school-age children have tongue thrust. For example, according to recent literature, as many as 67–95 percent of children 5–8 years old exhibit tongue thrust, which may be associated with or contributing to an orthodontic or speech problem. Up to the age of four, there is a possibility that the child will outgrow tongue thrust. However, if the tongue thrust swallowing pattern is retained beyond that age, it may be strengthened.\n\nFactors that can contribute to tongue thrusting include macroglossia (enlarged tongue), thumb sucking, large tonsils, hereditary factors, ankyloglossia (tongue tie), and certain types of artificial nipples used in feeding infants, also allergies or nasal congestion can cause the tongue to lie low in the mouth because of breathing obstruction and finally contributing to tongue thrusting. In addition, it is also seen after prolonged therapy by levodopa in Parkinsonism, also it occurs as extra pyramidal side effect (Acute muscular dystonia) after use of Neuroleptics (Anti-Psychotics). \n\nTongue thrust is normal in infants until approximately the age of six months. The loss of this normal infant behavior is one of the signs that the baby is ready to begin eating baby food.\n\nTongue thrusting can adversely affect the teeth and mouth. A person swallows from 1,200 to 2,000 times every 24 hours with about four pounds (1.8 kg) of pressure each time. If a person suffers from tongue thrusting, this continuous pressure tends to force the teeth out of alignment. Many people who tongue thrust have open bites; the force of the tongue against the teeth is an important factor in contributing to \"bad bite\" (malocclusion). Many orthodontists have completed dental treatment with what appeared to be good results, only to discover that the case relapsed because of the patient's tongue thrust. If the tongue is allowed to continue its pushing action against the teeth, it will continue to push the teeth forward and reverse the orthodontic work.\n\nSpeech is not frequently affected by the tongue thrust swallowing pattern. The \"S\" sound (lisping) is the one most affected. The lateral lisp (air forced on the side of the tongue rather than forward) shows dramatic improvement when the tongue thrust is corrected. However, lisping and tongue thrust are not always associated.\n\nTreatment for uncontrolled tongue thrust requires habit retraining in conjunction with a dental appliance.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51662874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51662874", "title": "Transparency of media ownership in Croatia", "text": "Transparency of media ownership in Croatia\n\nTransparency of media ownership refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures to make possible for media authority and the wider public to ascertain who effectively owns and controls the media. Between 2011 and 2012, following some concerns on opaque activities which accompanied the process of privatisation of the media in Croatia, the government initiated the reform of the law on transparency of media ownership with the aim to avoid the concealment of information on media ownership structure.\n\nThe Croatian law provides the disclosure of information that are sufficient to establish who formally holds shares in the media organisations operating in Croatia. However, in practice, some obstacles have been observed. There are also some unclear aspects in the new legal framework which is the result of uncoordinated legal developments needed to complement the original Media Act with provisions to be applied to electronic media, which emerged several years later and that are now covered by a dedicated law, namely the Electronic Media Law. In general terms, the information disclosed can be accessed by the public at large, but, as a matter of fact, this is quite uncommon. In Croatia, the public debate on media ownership transparency developed only recently, in connection with the amendments to the Media Act and Electronic Media Act.\n\nTransparency of media ownership refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures. It is an essential component of any democratic media system and its crucial for media pluralism and democracy. A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes available all the information needed for finding out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies. The importance of transparency of media ownership for any democratic and pluralist society has been broadly recognised by the European Parliament, the European Commission's High-Level Group on Media Freedom and Pluralism and the Council of Europe.\n\nTo ensure that the public knows who effectively owns and influences the media, national legal frameworks should ensure the disclosure of at least the following basic information:\n\nImportantly, to understand who really owns and controls a specific media outlet it is necessary to check who is beyond the official shareholdings and scrutinise indirect, controlling and beneficial ownership which refers on shares of a media company hold on behalf of another person. To be meaningful and easily accessible by the citizens and national media authorities, this information should be updated, searchable, free and reusable.\n\nIn 2011, concerns about opaque media financial flows led to changes to the laws regulating media ownership transparency to make possible the identification of media owners beyond a company back to individuals. Indeed, the relevant laws have been updated to ensure better ownership transparency of media publishers, in particular to avoid the concealment of the real media ownership structure. The process of privatisation of the print media in Croatia, which began in 2000, had been accompanied by corruption scandals and rumours of money laundering and the involvement of criminal groups in the sales of the biggest Croatian newspapers, i.e. \"Jutarnji list\", \"Večerni List\" and \"Slobodna Dalmacija\". The names of the real owners of these media was hidden behind secret contracts and informal agreements involving politicians, police and other high-profile individuals. Changes to the Media Act and the Electronic Media Act were very quick and passed with limited consultation by the Parliament in July 2011 for the Media Act and in June 2012 for the Electronic Media Act.\n\nTransparency of media ownership in Croatia is regulated by the Media Law (2011) and the Electronic Media Law (2012). These rules apply to all the media sectors, i.e. print, broadcast and online media which are required to regularly provide and update information on their shareholders. These laws contain provisions for disclosing ownership information to: the relevant media authorities, i.e. the Electronic Media Council in the case on online media (Electronic Media Act); to independent professional and business organisations such as the Croatian Chamber of Economy and other corporate and trade registers (Media Act); or directly to the public. In general terms, the Croatian legal framework requires media to reveal enough information to make possible the identification of their owners, be it an individual or a company. This includes data on all shareholdings over 1%, disclosure of beneficial ownership and of people with indirect interests and control as well as a prohibition on \"secret\" ownership. The information disclosed are provided directly to the public via the web and Official Gazette.\n\nUpon request, the Croatian Chamber of Economy, which is responsible for collecting ownership data, must guarantee public access to the information submitted to it. This is in compliance with the recognised right of access to information under the Act on the Right to Access Information.\n\nThe amendments have had little impact on the ownership structure of Croatian media, which remain questionable. This is because most of the privatisation, which in many cases was reported to be suspicious or controversial, were completed before the amended laws entered into force.\n\nDespite the good provisions enshrined in the reformed legal framework which built upon existing obligations, the lack of consultation that led to the amendments to the Media Act and the Electronic Media Act resulted in a series of shortcomings especially with regard to monitoring and enforcement of the laws. For instance, in practice, media companies in Croatia do not always comply with their obligation to publish information on indirect ownership and the law doesn't foresee a mechanism for monitoring, checking compliance and apply sanctions. Indeed, the Media act does not provide for effective mechanism enabling the Croatian Chamber of Economy to check that the information received are updated and correct. Given the scarcity of resources assigned to it, the Chamber has to rely on the assistance of other authorities such as the Croatian Competition Agency and the Company Register. Another critical point of the Croatian system regulating transparency of media ownership is that it does not guarantee the full disclosure of information on individuals holding shares of a media company. Indeed, often the name of a company is not enough for providing information on the individuals behind it. For example, on the basis of the information provided under the law regulating transparency of media ownership the media companies \"Europa digital d.o.o\"., \"Slobodna Dalmacija\", \"EPH Media\" and \"Gloria Groupa\" apparently don't have anything in common, but they are all subsidiary companies within the \"EPH group\", owned by \"WAZ\" and the businessman Ninoslav Pavić. Additionally, in practice, media outlets do not always disclose information on indirect ownership as required by the law. For example, the only shareholder listed for the media company \"Vecernji list d.d\"., which issues the daily paper \"Vecernji list\" is Styria Media International AG from Graz. Other relevant ownership information are not disclosed, for instance information regarding the important shareholders of Styra Media International AG or whether that company holds some shares for another person or a company. Furthermore, the publication of data in the Official Gazette is not monitored and since there is there is not a special issue of the Official Gazette listing the updates occurred during the year the search is complex and time-consuming.\nIn sum, despite the fact that the laws on transparency of media ownership are well defined, in practice is quite difficult to assess the actual ownership structures and reconstruct the networks of ownership and connected persons. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that, according to the Croatian law, different agencies are in charge of collecting data on ownership – the Council for Electronic media is responsible for online media and the Croatian Chamber of Commerce for print media – without a unique centralised monitoring system working across print, radio, television and online media.\n\nIn October 2014, the European Commission organised a consultative conference on transparency of media ownership and Croatia was mentioned as \"a good practice\" in this context. However, many panellists participating at the conference highlighted that it is important to insist on the improvement of the legal framework but that is not enough as, according to experts, it is more important to know who effectively controls the owners than who nominally owns the media.\n\n"}
{"id": "50080000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50080000", "title": "Travel in Classical antiquity", "text": "Travel in Classical antiquity\n\nTravel in Classical antiquity over long distances was a specialized undertaking. Most travel was done in the interest of warfare, diplomacy, general state building, or trade. Social motivations for travel included visiting religious sites, festivals such as the Olympics, and health-related reasons. Most travel was difficult and expensive, both due to danger of violence, as well as the scarcity of well-maintained roads, and the variability of travel times over water, as ancient ships were subject to the vagaries of both the wind and the tides.\n\nMuch of ancient literature is concerned with travel. \"The Odyssey\", for example, relates the tale of Odysseus’ travel home to Ithaca over a ten-year period; later, the \"Aeneid\" tells the story of Aeneas' flight from Troy. Elsewhere, travel narratives from authors such as Herodotus and Caesar form more grounded examples of how individuals moved throughout the ancient world. Both Greek and Roman society had mores surrounding travel and the treatment of guests.\n\nThe first instances of long-distance travel in the broader Mediterranean world occurred in what are today Egypt and Iraq. In Egypt the Nile served as a conduit for trade and transportation, while in the Near East, river travel on the Tigris and Euphrates was supplemented by long distance travel over land in wagon-like vehicles pulled by oxen. Later, the chariot developed, which was originally reserved for royalty, although it later became integrated into warfare. In the Near East, large but not particularly sophisticated systems of roads evolved; later these would be connected and developed by the Persians.\n\nThe primary motivation for the development of travel and infrastructure to support it in both Egypt and the Near East was conquest and subsequent rule, a trend that continued in Greece and Rome. There is evidence, however, of travel motivated by tourism in Egypt, with visitors and scribes coming to view and record the pyramids and other religious monuments.\n\nThe earliest maritime travel occurred on the Nile and other rivers in the Near East. Due to the lack of roads in ancient Greece, the most efficient way of shipping large amounts of goods, such as olive oil, was over the sea. Greek ships were built in varying sizes, with the largest accommodating as much as 500 tons of goods. Despite reliance on favorable weather, relatively little effort went into short sea voyages beyond the packing and management of the ship, although there was the danger of pirates and kidnapping for ransom.\n\nFor Romans, the seas were more or less clear of pirates due to the Roman military, although the fear of shipwreck by storm was greater, and often referenced in poetry and song. Passage by ship was considerably more pleasant than passage by land, but was not available throughout the year due to changes in tides and other weather conditions.\n\nThe earliest notable road system in the ancient Mediterranean world was the Royal Road. The most extensive incarnation of the system was unified and organized under Darius I, ruler of the Achaemenid Empire in the 5th century BCE. It was built from connecting and upgrading older systems, and was used to enable rapid communication and transportation throughout the empire, as well as the collection of taxes. Generally, other contemporary roads were not paved or well maintained, making land travel both on foot and horseback arduous and time-consuming.\n\nGreek roads were poorly developed due to the fragmentation of Greek society at the state level, and due to the extreme cost of constructing roads in Greece's mountainous terrain. At least in Athens, when built, roads were funded through special taxes on wealthy. Some roads were difficult to traverse even on foot, and most could not be traversed with the heavy wagons built to haul goods. Notable exceptions were the roads between major cities and nearby sanctuaries and holy sites, which were built to endure all weather. However, no portion of the Greek highway system included state-sponsored way stations or milestones, as found later in Rome.\n\nThere was danger of violence on Greek roads. For the same reasons that roads in Greece were poorly and rarely constructed, there was essentially no oversight by official forces, and as such travelers were prone to being accosted by highwaymen. As such, having a large entourage was useful for protection, and the transportation of valuables was risky.\n\nRoman roads were extensive, largely to facilitate the transportation of the military. They suffered from lack of maintenance, at least during the Roman Republic due to the fact that more visible projects (new city-centric construction, such as aqueducts, and arena games) took precedence. The roads were built with few resources, and had to be built to function in a variety of geographical and seasonal conditions. As Roman roads radiated away from towns, they became less elaborate, and were sometimes paved with gravel, or markers were used to illustrate the proper path. This lack of attention to detail is contrasted with the uniform stone highways that generally existed near major urban centers, typically built by soldiers overseen by army engineers. Romans tended to build their roads without curves as often as possible. The danger of violence was much less pronounced on Roman roads, due to the strong central military that did not attend the limited Greek highway network.\n\nDue to the difficulty and stress of travel by land, few civilians chose to conduct long-distance travel or trade over Rome's roads. Instead, tax collectors, couriers, soldiers and other government officials would have been the primary users of the highway network.\n\nThere is debate as to whether or not the Greeks and Romans produced representative maps to serve as guides, and, if so, the level of their sophistication. Those who argue that there was no formal practice of cartography in the ancient world cite the lack of evidence, and the lack of materials that would have formed viable maps. Chinese contemporaries of the Romans did produce durable maps through their access to durable silk. Papyrus, the most likely Mediterranean candidate that could have been produced cheaply, was too sensitive, and would not have withstood long-term use. Other materials that might have been used (wood or vellum) have not survived; the only records that exist to this day are in the form of text, either as travelogues or descriptions of maps.\n\nWithout ready access to maps, both Greeks and Romans relied on \"itineraria\" to conduct sea travel, and the Romans used the documents for land travel as well. These documents were lists of cities or ports and the distances between them. Itineraria may have sometimes included crude illustrations, never to scale, to orient travelers as they moved through Roman or Greek territory. Extant examples, both saved by monastic copying traditions, include the Antonine Itinerary (which included roads in Britain) and the Tabula Peutingeriana (which may have been a guide for couriers, or a decoration).\n\nGreek maps were often either localized, intended to demonstrate the shapes of specific cities, or to represent abstract concepts, such as the realm of the \"oikoumene\", or known world. There are no extant Greek maps, but descriptions of one by Anaximander and others indicate that of they split the \"oikoumene\" into continents—Europe, Asia, and Libya—within which there were further classifications. Divisions between continents and nations were often determined by bodies of water. Greek maps further separated the world into habitable and inhospitable zones, and some maps included the concept of the antipodes, an \"oikoumene\" in another habitable zone of the Earth not accessible with Greek transportation technologies.\n\nLater Greek scientists determined that the Earth was round, although there was some debate as to the veracity of this claim. During the conquests by Alexander the Great, Hellenistic knowledge of the world was expanded, resulting in an improved map of the world by Eratosthenes. He also calculated the circumference of the Earth, and published two treatises about geography, titled \"Geographica\" and \"On the Measurement of the Earth\". Contemporaries of Eratosthenes questioned the validity of his methods, although his calculation of the Earth's circumference was quite accurate.\n\nLike the Greeks, the Romans did not possess the materials or technology to produce useful maps. Several examples of what may have been Roman maps have been introduced through archaeology, although both their validity as maps and even their authenticity have been debated. Romans used \"itineraria\" in warfare, to guide government postal workers, and for civilian travel. Those that contained illustrations to underscore the text would not have been to scale, and would have born more similarity to transit maps than contemporary to-scale maps. Although not used for travel, there is evidence of maps created after surveys by the Roman government, in a process known as centuriation in which the land was reduced to grids for cultivation.\n\nWritings in Greek that could be qualified as travel narratives included \"Histories\" by Herodotus. Sections of the work are devoted to geographic and ethnographic descriptions of the territories encountered during his travels, which ranged from Egypt to the Persian Empire. Strabo also compiled his travels into a major work, \"Geographica\", which outlined his conceptions of the world and the geographies of regions such as what are today Spain and India.\n\nNarratives from Rome that include travel include Caesar's \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\", which describes Caesar's conquest of Gaul. Tacitus' \"Germania\" relies on information he gained from those who had journeyed to Germany, although he never did.\n\nParadoxography is a genre of classical travel writing that recounts encounters with foreign or supernatural peoples, animals, and events. There were whole works devoted to such descriptions such as works by Palaephatus, and an otherwise anonymous Apollonius. Portions of other texts also include paradoxography in certain sections, including \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\", \"Histories\", and certain versions of the Alexander romance.\n\nGreek hospitality demanded the fair treatment of guests and the reciprocal treatment of hosts, outlined in the concept of \"xenia\". \"Xenia\" demanded both abstract respect as well as the exchange of material goods, such as gifts and food. Much of \"The Odyssey\" deals with Odysseus' treatment by guests, and his own violations of \"xenia\". \"Xenia\" also appears in other Greek myths, such as that of Baucis and Philemon, in which a disguised Zeus and Hermes are given shelter and food by an elderly couple after their neighbors refused to accommodate the deities; the couple is subsequently rewarded.\n\nIn a non-mythological context, \"xenia\" provided for the equitable treatment of foreign dignitaries, traders, and guests while visiting alien city-states through the office of the \"proxenos\". A \"proxenos\" was a city-appointed official, either a native or a resident alien, who would look over the citizens of a specific foreign city when they visited the city he represented. That is, for example, a native citizen of Athens or a resident Corinthian would be appointed \"proxenos\" for visitors of Corinth in Athens, and was therefore responsible for both diplomacy between the two cities and the interests of Corinthian citizens in Athens. Looking after another city's citizens meant arranging for favors as mundane as obtaining theater tickets, to more complicated procedures, such as ensuring access to capital or an audience with city officials. In addition to cities, trade groups or other organizations might appoint a \"proxenos\" to ensure their clients were treated fairly during visits.\n\nThe office of \"proxenos\" was honorary, and came only with a title and the prestige associated with the appointment. Some scholarship suggests that although the \"proxenos\" was tasked with diplomacy, they also may have occasionally engaged in subterfuge or intelligence gathering in order to grant their native city the upper hand in conflicts.\n\nThere is little evidence of a formalized system of inns in Greek cities, although some have been found that served tourists during festivals. These were organized around a central courtyard, and would have provided stables as well as beds.\n\nRoman hospitality mores were less formalized than in Greek civilization, although it was informed by both xenia and the concept of \"hospitium\", essentially a Romanized version of the earlier term. Rome and Roman cities had systems of inns within their walls, individually known as \"hospitium\" or \"deversorium\". These were available to all, and offered services ranging from simple access to a place to sleep to restaurants and stables. Cheaper alternatives, known as \"caupona\", catered to sailors and soldiers, and offered alcohol in a less formal restaurant setting, as well as prostitution. Generally, lining the roads outside major cities were other inns, known as \"stabulum\", which appealed to travelers.\n\nAncient travel was motivated by reasons as diverse as trade (including postal communications), religious pilgrimages, warfare, and tourism.\n\nTrade between different nations was an integral reason for travel. During the Roman Empire, trade was conducted with nations as disparate as China, India, and Tanzania. Generally, Roman and Chinese traders exchanged statues and other processed goods in exchange for Chinese silk. Trade in the city of Rome was focused around providing food for the city's massive population; as such, the trade of grain and other foods was subsidized by the government. Grain was brought into the city from all around empire: Egypt, Spain, Sardinia, and Sicily were all sources for the city.\n\nTrade was sophisticated enough in Rome that a system similar to that of the \"proxenos\" emerged, with offices backed by different governments representing the interests of their private citizens in cities throughout the Mediterranean. These offices, like way stations along the Roman roads, were known as \"stationes\".\n\nThere were at least two postal services during the history of Rome—the cursus publicus and the agentes in rebus. Both were created during the Roman Empire, and both survived its dissolution, at least for a time. The established routes of the cursus publicus are sometimes argued to be outlined in the Tabula Peutingeriana, a surviving illustrated itineraria from the 4th century, although this claim is disputed. Both services existed to deliver messages (including military orders) and to collect taxes. Occasionally they also acted as spies and couriers for the military, collecting intelligence and delivering orders. Couriers relied on \"stationes\" (publicly funded way-stations) and \"mansiones\" (private residences) for shelter and food, and had the ability to compel private citizens to provide for them.\n\nThe \"cursus publicus\" differed from a conventional, modern postal service in that it was not universal (it was only available in more developed provinces) and in that deliveries were made at the government's discretion, rather than on a regular schedule. Usage of the system of lodgings and animals used by the service required official permission from the provincial governor, or the emperor. Governors acted as overseers for the system, and some public officials were also entitled to use it as a form of personal transportation.\n\nPilgrimage to one of the major oracles was one of the central reasons for religious travel in the ancient world, particularly in Rome. These pilgrimages were generally made to oracles, such as that at Delphi, who was known as Pythia or simply the Oracle of Delphi, a title that passed to different women. Romans would have visited these oracles in the hopes of gaining some insight about their future. Generally, oracles were associated with a god. Pythia, for example, was associated with Apollo.\n\nHealth also played a role in motivating travel, both in Roman and Greek culture. Travelers visited sanctuaries associated with deities or gods and specific phys, such as the Greek one at Epidaurus, in the hopes of curing illness and disease. These sanctuaries would have sometimes been associated with specific physicians, as well as deities. Galen, for example, was famously associated with the sanctuary of Asclepius. Sanctuary sites were often isolated, and included springs, as well as diversions, such as works of art and stadiums for athletic events. Other forms of travel in the name of health, such as journeys by ship, also existed.\n\nIn Greco-Roman culture, festivals occurred either annually or every few years, and were held for religious reasons. Generally, they were held in fixed locations, and individuals traveled from city to city in order to attend. However, there were also universal festivals, occurring throughout Greece and Rome, and both universal and local festivals could be celebrated by citizens while abroad. The most popular of these festivals were the originally Greek games: the Pythian Games, the Isthmian Games, the Nemean Games, and, most famously, the Olympic Games. These revolved around the performance of artistic and athletic feats to honor individual deities, and continued to be celebrated after Rome's conquest of Greece.\n\nFestivals served deliberately to motivate travel, with the purpose of not only asserting communal identity at the imperial or societal level, rather than the local level, but also promoting Greek and Roman culture as opposed to foreign or \"barbaric\" practices. The length of festivals rarely exceeded five days, while travel times could be measured in weeks or months.\n\nLodgings available to the general public at festivals ranged from crude huts or tents to elaborate inns reserved for the Greek and Roman elite. Traders and those with connections in other cities often stayed in private homes. The influxes of tourists, particularly in Athens, created temporary economies, with vendors, prostitutes, and guides providing goods and services to the visitors.\n\nIn Rome, tourists traveled to beach and mountain side resorts for different periods of the year. It was not uncommon for even middle-class Romans to own multiple villas.\n\nWarfare and state building were the two most common reasons for travel by non-elite residents of Roman and Greek society. The pinnacle of travel in name of warfare in Hellenistic society was under Alexander, but his efforts to conquer the world were preceded by a general Greek and specifically Athenian colonial process that led to the foundation of cities throughout the Mediterranean. Warfare by Alexander led to the movement of Hellenistic peoples and culture as far east as India, with settlements in Afghanistan, Egypt, and elsewhere, and led to the establishment of several descendant kingdoms: the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Egypt.\n\nImmigration was also a motivation for travel, particularly to large urban centers, including Rome itself. There were few restrictions (except in wartime) on the ability of individuals and families to migrate and subsequently settle in cities, and despite stratification, there was still some level of upward mobility in Roman society.\n\nArchaeological evidence suggests that construction increased during times of heavy immigration, and that immigration increased during periods of conquest, and that it was at its lowest after the Sack of Rome by Alaric I.\n\n\n"}

The term tuition agency is an alternative term, used specifically in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nTutoring agencies are commercial organisations, specializing in introducing tutors to students requiring help in academic studies. Tutoring agencies exist largely due to the problems parents and students face in finding a specialist who can help them with the study of one or more specific subjects.\n\nSome agencies contract directly with the client (usually parents) to provide service. The point of contact is between the client and the agency. Tutoring agencies may charge tutors a commission fee for assigning jobs to them. In India, Malaysia and Singapore, this fee would typically be a half of the allocated job's monthly revenue to a tutor. Jobs that are assigned for a short duration, for example in the case of last minute revision for an exam, may carry a lesser fee of around a quarter of the job's monthly revenue to a tutor. Some tutoring agencies do not charge commission fees for jobs assigned to tutors or students.\n\nAlternatively, clients may be sent a list of names of tutors who have pre-registered with the tutoring agency and then contact the names on the list to ascertain which tutors are available and, if acceptable, make contractual arrangements with the chosen tutor. At the same time, tutors are given the name and contact details of the client and are encouraged to get their call in first.\n\nTutoring agencies are common in many countries including the UK, the US, Australia, the UAE, Singapore, and Malaysia. In most countries tutoring is not regulated.\n\nIn the UK after much discussion in the media a limited company was set up in October 2013. The Tutors' Association The Tutor Association was previously named The London Association Of Certified Financial Analysts.\n\nIn the US there are at least two professional tutoring associations: the American Tutoring Association and the National Tutoring Association.\n\nIn Australia there is the Australian Tutoring Association.\n\nIn Singapore, tutoring agencies, also known as tuition agencies, are not regulated by the Ministry of Education.\n\nThere are both full-time and part-time tutors. Part-time tutors may be students who want to earn extra money while they are still going to school, such as undergraduates of universities.\n\nTutors may be self-employed. If the agency does not employ the tutors, then the agency is remunerated by the tutor, who adds a fee to the amount that the client is charged each lesson, and then passes the fees back to the agency weekly or monthly as required. In Singapore, although tutor registration is generally free of charge, tutors will have to pay a percentage of his or her first month's tuition fee, usually 60% to the tuition agency as commission for referring them to students. Tutors will subsequently be paid the full month's tuition fees by the customer (the parents), according to the pre-arranged agreement.\n\nIf tutors are employed by the agency, the agency handles all client contract and payment arrangements. The agency is then responsible for employing the tutor with all that employment entails. From the agency's point of view, there is no longer any requirement to declare the fees charged by the agency (something which can cause friction with clients who do not appreciate the high cost of recruitment, vetting etc.) but they are now responsible for employee benefits due to the tutor.\n\nIn Singapore, parents and students have positive as well as negative comments.\n\nTutoring centers (tuition centers) must be registered with the Singapore Ministry of Education. However, tutoring agencies (tuition agencies) are not. Instead, tutoring agencies are required to register with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) under the Business Registration Act. There is a history of poor compliance and consumer complaints.\n\n"}
{"id": "167745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167745", "title": "Vaquero", "text": "Vaquero\n\nThe vaquero (, ) is a horse-mounted livestock herder of a tradition that originated on the Iberian Peninsula. Today the \"vaquero\" is still a part of the \"doma vaquera,\" the Spanish tradition of working riding. The \"vaquero\" traditions developed in Mexico from methodology brought to Mesoamerica from Spain and became the foundation for the North American cowboy. The \"vaqueros\" of the Americas were the horsemen and cattle herders of Spanish Mexico, who first came to California with the Jesuit priest Eusebio Kino in 1687, and later with expeditions in 1769 and the Juan Bautista de Anza expedition in 1774. They were the first cowboys in the region.\n\nIn the modern United States and Canada, remnants of two major and distinct \"vaquero\" traditions remain, known today as the \"Texas\" tradition and the \"Spanish\", \"Vaquero\", or \"California\" tradition. The popular \"horse whisperer\" style of natural horsemanship was originally developed by practitioners who were predominantly from California and the Northwestern United States, clearly combining the attitudes and philosophy of the California \"vaquero\" with the equipment and outward look of the Texas cowboy. The natural horsemanship movement openly acknowledges much influence of the vaquero tradition.\n\nThe cowboys of the Great Basin still use the term \"buckaroo\", which may be a corruption of \"vaquero\", to describe themselves and their tradition.\n\n\"Vaquero\" is a Spanish word for a herder of cattle. It derives from \"vaca\", meaning \"cow\", which in turn comes from the Latin word \"vacca\".\n\nA related term, \"buckaroo\", still is used to refer to a certain style of cowboys and horsemanship most often seen in the Great Basin region of the United States that closely retains characteristics of the traditional vaquero. The word \"buckaroo\" is generally believed to be an anglicized version of \"vaquero\" and shows phonological characteristics compatible with that origin. \"Buckaroo\" first appeared in American English in 1827 The word may also have developed with influences from the English word \"buck\" or bucking, the behavior of young, untrained horses. In 1960, one etymologist suggested that \"buckaroo\" derives, through , from the Ibibio and , meaning \"white man, master, boss\". Although that derivation was later rejected, another possibility advanced was that \"buckaroo\" was a pun on \"vaquero,\" blending both Spanish and African sources.\n\nThe origins of the \"vaquero\" tradition come from Spain, beginning with the \"hacienda\" system of medieval Spain. This style of cattle ranching spread throughout much of the Iberian peninsula and later, was imported to the Americas. Both regions possessed a dry climate with sparse grass, and thus large herds of cattle required vast amounts of land in order to obtain sufficient forage. The need to cover distances greater than a person on foot could manage gave rise to the development of the horseback-mounted \"vaquero\". Various aspects of the Spanish equestrian tradition can be traced back to Arabic rule in Spain, including Moorish elements such as the use of Oriental-type horses, the \"jineta\" riding style characterized by a shorter stirrup, solid-treed saddle and use of spurs, the heavy noseband or hackamore, ( \"šakīma\", Spanish \"jaquima\") and other horse-related equipment and techniques. Certain aspects of the Arabic tradition, such as the hackamore, can in turn be traced to roots in ancient Persia.\n\nDuring the 16th century, the Conquistadors and other Spanish settlers brought their cattle-raising traditions as well as both horses and domesticated cattle to the Americas, starting with their arrival in what today is Mexico and Florida. The traditions of Spain were transformed by the geographic, environmental and cultural circumstances of New Spain, which later became Mexico and the Southwestern United States. In turn, the land and people of the Americas also saw dramatic changes due to Spanish influence.\n\nThe arrival of horses in the Americas was particularly significant, as equines had been extinct there since the end of the prehistoric ice age. However, horses quickly multiplied in America and became crucial to the success of the Spanish and later settlers from other nations. The earliest horses were originally of Andalusian, Barb and Arabian ancestry, but a number of uniquely American horse breeds developed in North and South America through selective breeding and by natural selection of animals that escaped to the wild and became feral. The Mustang and other colonial horse breeds are now called \"wild\", but in reality are feral horses—descendants of domesticated animals.\n\nThe Spanish tradition evolved further in what today is Mexico and the Southwestern United States into the \"vaquero\" of northern Mexico and the \"charro\" of the Jalisco and Michoacán regions. Most \"vaqueros\" were men of mestizo and Native American origin while most of the \"hacendados\" (ranch owners) were ethnically Spanish. Mexican traditions spread both South and North, influencing equestrian traditions from Argentina to Canada.\n\nAs English-speaking traders and settlers expanded westward, English and Spanish traditions, language and culture merged to some degree. Before the Mexican–American War in 1848, New England merchants who traveled by ship to California encountered both \"hacendados\" and \"vaqueros\", trading manufactured goods for the hides and tallow produced from vast cattle ranches. American traders along what later became known as the Santa Fe Trail had similar contacts with \"vaquero\" life. Starting with these early encounters, the lifestyle and language of the \"vaquero\" began a transformation which merged with English cultural traditions and produced what became known in American culture as the \"cowboy\".\n\nMesteñeros were vaqueros that caught, broke and drove Mustangs to market in the Spanish and later Mexican, and still later American territories of what is now Northern Mexico, Texas, New Mexico and California. They caught the horses that roamed the Great Plains and the San Joaquin Valley of California, and later in the Great Basin, from the 18th century to the early 20th century.\n\nDistinct regional traditions arose in the United States, particularly in Texas and California, distinguished by local culture, geography and historical patterns of settlement. In turn, the California tradition had an influence on cattle handling traditions in Hawaii. The \"buckaroo\" or \"California\" tradition, most closely resemblied that of the original vaquero, while the \"Texas\" tradition melded some Spanish technique with methods from the eastern states, creating separate and unique styles indigenous to the region. The modern distinction between \"vaquero\" and \"buckaroo\" within American English may also reflect the parallel differences between the California and Texas traditions of western horsemanship.\n\nThe Spanish or Mexican vaquero who worked with young, untrained horses, arrived in the 1700s and flourished in California and bordering territories during the Spanish Colonial period. Settlers from the United States did not enter California until after the Mexican–American War, and most early settlers were miners rather than livestock ranchers, leaving livestock-raising largely to the Spanish and Mexican people who chose to remain in California. The California vaquero or buckaroo, unlike the Texas cowboy, was considered a highly skilled worker, who usually stayed on the same ranch where he was born or had grown up. He generally married and raised a family. In addition, the geography and climate of much of California was dramatically different from that of Texas, allowing more intensive grazing with less open range, plus cattle in California were marketed primarily at a regional level, without the need (nor, until much later, even the logistical possibility) to be driven hundreds of miles to railroad lines. Thus, a horse- and livestock-handling culture remained in California and the Pacific Northwest that retained a stronger direct Spanish influence than that of Texas.\nCowboys of this tradition were dubbed \"buckaroos\" by English-speaking settlers. The words \"buckaroo\" and \"vaquero\" are still used on occasion in the Great Basin, parts of California and, less often, in the Pacific Northwest. Elsewhere, the term \"cowboy\" is more common.\n\nThe Texas tradition arose from a combination of cultural influences, as well as the need to adapt to the geography and climate of west Texas and, later, the need to conduct long cattle drives to get animals to market. In the early 1800s, the Spanish Crown, and later, independent Mexico, offered \"empresario\" grants in what would later be Texas to non-citizens, such as settlers from the United States. In 1821, Stephen F. Austin and his East Coast comrades became the first Anglo-Saxon community speaking Spanish. Following Texas independence in 1836, even more Americans immigrated into the \"empresario\" ranching areas of Texas. Here the settlers were strongly influenced by the Mexican \"vaquero\" culture, borrowing vocabulary and attire from their counterparts, but also retaining some of the livestock-handling traditions and culture of the Eastern United States and Great Britain.\n\nFollowing the American Civil War, vaquero culture diffused eastward and northward, combining with the cow herding traditions of the eastern United States that evolved as settlers moved west. Other influences developed out of Texas as cattle trails were created to meet up with the railroad lines of Kansas and Nebraska, in addition to expanding ranching opportunities in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain Front, east of the Continental Divide. The Texas-style vaquero tended to be an itinerant single male who moved from ranch to ranch.\n\nThe Hawaiian cowboy, the \"paniolo\", is also a direct descendant of the \"vaquero\" of California and Mexico. Experts in Hawaiian etymology believe \"Paniolo\" is a Hawaiianized pronunciation of \"español.\" (The Hawaiian language has no /s/ sound, and all syllables and words must end in a vowel.) Paniolo, like cowboys on the mainland of North America, learned their skills from Mexican \"vaqueros.\"\n\nBy the early 19th century, Capt. George Vancouver's gift of cattle to Pai`ea Kamehameha, monarch of the Hawaiian Kingdom, had multiplied astonishingly, and were wreaking havoc throughout the countryside. About 1812, John Parker, a sailor who had jumped ship and settled in the islands, received permission from Kamehameha to capture the wild cattle and develop a beef industry.\n\nThe Hawaiian style of ranching originally included capturing wild cattle by driving them into pits dug in the forest floor. Once tamed somewhat by hunger and thirst, they were hauled out up a steep ramp, and tied by their horns to the horns of a tame, older steer (or ox) that knew where the paddock with food and water was located. The industry grew slowly under the reign of Kamehameha's son Liholiho (Kamehameha II). Later, Liholiho's brother, Kauikeaouli (Kamehameha III), visited California, then still a part of Mexico. He was impressed with the skill of the Mexican vaqueros, and invited several to Hawaii in 1832 to teach the Hawaiian people how to work cattle.\n\nEven today, traditional paniolo dress, as well as certain styles of Hawaiian formal attire, reflect the Spanish heritage of the vaquero. The traditional Hawaiian saddle, the \"noho lio,\" and many other tools of the cowboy's trade have a distinctly Mexican/Spanish look and many Hawaiian ranching families still carry the names of the vaqueros who married Hawaiian women and made Hawaii their home.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "140585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140585", "title": "Western Pennsylvania English", "text": "Western Pennsylvania English\n\nWestern Pennsylvania English, known more narrowly as Pittsburgh English or popularly as Pittsburghese, is a dialect of American English native primarily to the western half of Pennsylvania, centered on the city of Pittsburgh, but potentially appearing as far north as Erie County, as far east as Sunbury, Pennsylvania, as far west as metropolitan Youngstown (Ohio), and as far south as micropolitan Clarksburg (West Virginia). Commonly associated with the white working class of Pittsburgh, users of the dialect are colloquially known as \"Yinzers\".\n\nScots-Irish, Pennsylvania German, Polish, Ukrainian and Croatian immigrants to the area all provided certain loanwords to the dialect (see \"Vocabulary\" below). Although many of the sounds and words found in this dialect are popularly thought to be unique to the city of Pittsburgh only, this is a misconception, since the dialect resides throughout the greater part of western Pennsylvania and surrounding areas. Central Pennsylvania, currently an intersection of several dialect regions, was identified in 1949 by Hans Kurath as a sub-region between western and eastern Pennsylvania, though some scholars have more recently identified it within the western Pennsylvania dialect region. Since the time of Kurath's study, one of western Pennsylvania's defining features, the cot–caught merger, has expanded into central Pennsylvania, moving eastward until being blocked at Harrisburg. Perhaps the only feature whose distribution is restricted almost exclusively to the immediate vicinity of Pittsburgh is monophthongization, in which words such as \"house\", \"down\", \"found\", or \"sauerkraut\" are sometimes pronounced with an \"ah\" sound instead of the more standard pronunciation of \"ow\", rendering eye spellings such as \"hahs\", \"dahn\", \"fahnd\", and \"sahrkraht\".\n\nSpeakers of Pittsburgh English are sometimes called \"Yinzers\", in reference to their use of the 2nd-person plural pronoun \"yinz.\" The word \"yinzer\" is sometimes heard as pejorative, indicating a lack of sophistication, although the term is now used in a variety of ways. Older men are more likely to use the accent than women, \"...possibly because of a stronger interest in displaying local identity...\"\n\nA defining feature of Western Pennsylvania English is the cot–caught merger, in which (as in \"ah\") and (as in \"aw\") merges to a rounded vowel: . Therefore, \"cot\" and \"caught\" are both pronounced ; \"Don\" and \"dawn\" are both . While the merger of these low back vowels is also widespread elsewhere in the United States, the rounded realizations of the merged vowel around is less common, except in Canada and Northeastern New England.\n\nThe sound as in \"oh\" begins more fronted in the mouth, as in the Southern U.S. or Southern England. Therefore, \"go\" is pronounced . Similarly, as in \"food\" and \"rude\" is fronted, and often diphthongized, as in much of the American South, Midland, and West.\n\nThe diphthong , as in \"ow\", is monophthongized to in some environments (sounding instead like \"ah\"), including before nasal consonants (e.g., \"downtown\" and \"found\" ), liquid consonants (e.g., \"fowl\", \"hour\") and obstruents (e.g., \"house\" , \"out\", \"cloudy\"). This monophthongization does not occur, however, in word-final positions (e.g., \"how\", \"now\"), where the diphthong remains . This is one of the few features, if not the only one, restricted almost exclusively to western Pennsylvania in North America, although it can sometimes be found in other accents of the English-speaking world, such as Cockney and South African English. This sound may be the result of contact from Slavic languages during the early twentieth century. Monopthongization also occurs for the sound , as in \"eye\", before liquid consonants, so that \"tile\" is pronounced ; \"pile\" is pronounced ; and \"iron\" is pronounced . Due to this phenomenon, \"tire\" may merge with the sound of \"tar\": .\n\nAn epenthetic (intruding) sound may occur after vowels in a small number of words, such as in \"water\" pronounced like \"warter\" , and \"wash\" like \"warsh\" .\n\nA number of vowel mergers occur uniquely in Western Pennsylvania English before the consonant . The pair of vowels and may each merge before the consonant, cause both \"steel\" and \"still\" to be pronounced as something like . Similarly, , , and may merge before , so that \"pool\", \"pull\", and \"pole\" may merge to something like . On the merger, Labov, Ash and Boberg (2006) note \"the stereotype of merger of /il ~ iyl/ is based only on a close approximation of some forms, and does not represent the underlying norms of the dialect\". The merger is found in western Pennsylvania, as well as parts of the southern United States, including Alabama, Texas and the west (McElhinny 1999). On the other hand, the merger is consistently found only in western Pennsylvania. The merger towards may also appear before (so that \"eagle\" can sound to outsiders like \"iggle\"). The vowel (as in \"uh\") before , may lower into the vowel of the cot–caught merger mentioned above, so that \"mull\" can sound identical to \"mall/maul\": .\n\n\"L\"-vocalization is also common in the Western Pennsylvania dialect, in which an sounds like a , or a cross between a vowel and a \"dark\" , when at the end of a syllable. An example is that \"well\" is pronounced as ; \"milk\" as or ; \"role\" as ; and \"cold\" as . This phenomenon is also common in African-American English.\n\nWestern Pennsylvania English speakers may use falling intonation at the end of questions, for example, in \"Are you painting your garage?\" (with pitch rising in intonation up to just before the last syllable and then falling precipitously). Such speakers typically use falling pitch for yes/no questions for which they already are quite sure of the answer. So, a speaker uttering the above example is simply confirming what they think they already know, that yes, the person they're talking to is painting his/her garage. Most common in areas of heavy German settlement, especially southeastern Pennsylvania —hence its nickname, the \"Pennsylvania Dutch question\"—but also found elsewhere in Pennsylvania, including Pittsburgh (Maxfield 1931; Layton 1999; Wisnosky 2003; Johnstone, Andrus and Danielson 2006). The origin of this is German.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10623474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10623474", "title": "Wildness", "text": "Wildness\n\nWildness, in its literal sense, is the quality of being wild or untamed. Beyond this, it has been defined as a quality produced in nature, as that which emerges from a forest, and as a level of achievement in nature. More recently, it has been defined as \"a quality of interactive processing between organism and nature where the realities of base natures are met, allowing the construction of durable systems\". A wilderness is a place where wildness occurs.\n\nPeople have explored the contrast of wildness versus tameness throughout recorded history. The earliest great work of literature, the Epic of Gilgamesh, tells a story of a wild man Enkidu in opposition to Gilgamesh who personifies civilization. In the story, Enkidu is defeated by Gilgamesh and becomes civilized. Cultures vary in their perception of the separation of humans from nature, with western civilization drawing a sharp contrast between the two while the traditions of many indigenous peoples have always seen humans as part of nature. The perception of man's place in nature and civilization has also changed over time. In western civilization, for example, Darwinism and environmentalism have renewed the perception of humans as part of nature, rather than separate from it.\nWildness is often mentioned in the writings of naturalists, such as John Muir and David Brower, where it is admired for its freshness and otherness. Henry David Thoreau wrote the famous phrase, “In wildness is the preservation of the world.” Some artists and photographers such as Eliot Porter explore wildness in the themes of their works. The benefits of reconnecting with nature by seeing the achievements of wildness is an area being investigated by ecopsychology.\n\nAttempts to identify the characteristics of wildness are varied. One consideration sees wildness as that part of nature which is not controllable by humans. Nature retains a measure of autonomy, or wildness, apart from human constructions (Evanoff, 2005). Another version of this theme is that wildness produces things that are natural, while humans produce things that are artificial (man-made). Ambiguities about the distinction between the natural and the artificial animate much of art, literature and philosophy. There is the perception that naturally produced items have a greater elegance over artificial things. Modern zoos seek to improve the health and vigour of animals by simulating natural settings, in a move away from stark man-made structures.\n\nAnother view of wildness is that it is a social construct (Callicott 1994), and that humans cannot be considered innately ‘unnatural’. As wildness is claimed to be a quality that builds from animals and ecosystems, it often fails to be considered within reductionist theories for nature.\n\nMeanwhile, an ecological perspective sees wildness as \"(the degree of) subjection to natural selection pressures\", many of which emerge independently from the biosphere. Thus modern civilization - contrasted with all humanity – can be seen as an 'unnatural' force (lacking wildness) as it strongly insulates its population from many natural selection mechanisms, including interspecific competition such as predation and disease, as well as some intraspecific phenomena.\n\nThe importance of maintaining wildness in animals is recognized in the management of Wilderness areas. Feeding wild animals in national parks for example, is usually discouraged because the animals may lose the skills they need to fend for themselves. Human interventions may also upset continued natural selection pressures upon the population, producing a version of domestication within wildlife (Peterson et al. 2005).\n\nTameness implies a reduction in wildness, where animals become more easily handled by humans. Some animals are easier to tame than others, and are amenable to domestication.\n\nIn a clinical setting, \"wildness\" has been used as a scale to rate the ease with which various strains of laboratory mice can be captured and handled (Wahlsten et al. 2003):\n\nIn this sense, \"wildness\" may be interpreted as \"tendency to respond with anxiety to handling\". That there is no \"necessary\" connection between this factor and the state of wildness \"per se\", given that some animals in the wild may be handled with little or no cause of anxiety. However, this factor does clearly indicate an animal's resistance to being handled.\n\nA classification system can be set out showing the spectrum from wild to domesticated animal states:\n\nThis classification system does not account for several complicating factors: genetically modified organisms, feral populations, and hybridization. Many species that are farmed or ranched are now being genetically modified. This creates a unique category of them because it alters the organisms as a group but in ways unlike traditional domestication. Feral organisms are members of a population that was once raised under human control, but is now living and multiplying outside of human control. Examples include mustangs. Hybrids can be wild, domesticated, or both: a liger is a hybrid of two wild animals, a mule is a hybrid of two domesticated animals, and a beefalo is a cross between a wild and a domestic animal.\n\nThe basic idea of ecopsychology is that while the human mind is shaped by the modern social world, it can be readily inspired and comforted by the wider natural world, because that is the arena in which it originally evolved. Mental health or unhealth cannot be understood in the narrow context of only intrapsychic phenomena or social relations. One also has to include the relationship of humans to other species and ecosystems. These relations have a deep evolutionary history; reach a natural affinity within the structure of their brains and they have deep psychic significance in the present time, in spite of urbanization. Humans are dependent on healthy nature not only for their physical sustenance, but for mental health, too.\n\nThe concept of a state of nature was first posited by the 17th century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes in \"Leviathan\". Hobbes described the concept in the Latin phrase \"bellum omnium contra omnes\", meaning \"the war of all against all.\" In this state any person has a natural right to do anything to preserve their own liberty or safety. Famously, he believed that such a condition would lead to a \"war of every man against every man\" and make life \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\"\n\nHobbes's view was challenged in the eighteenth century by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who claimed that Hobbes was taking socialized persons and simply imagining them living outside of the society they were raised in. He affirmed instead that people were born neither good nor bad; men knew neither vice nor virtue since they had almost no dealings with each other. Their bad habits are the products of civilization specifically social hierarchies, property, and markets. Another criticism put forth by Karl Marx is his concept of species-being, or the unique potential of humans for dynamic, creative, and cooperative relations between each other. For Marx and others in his line of critical theory, alienated and abstracted social relations prevent the fulfillment of this potential (see anomie).\n\nDavid Hume's view brings together and challenges the theories of Rousseau and Hobbes. He posits that in the natural state we are born wicked and evil because of, for instance, the cry of the baby that demands attention. Like Rousseau, he believes that society shapes us, but that we are born evil and it is up to society to shape us into who we become.\n\nThoreau made many statements on wildness:\nIn Wildness is the preservation of the World. — \"Walking\"\n\nI wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute Freedom and Wildness, as contrasted with a Freedom and Culture merely civil, — to regard man as an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society. — \"Walking\"\n\nI long for wildness, a nature which I cannot put my foot through, woods where the wood thrush forever sings, where the hours are early morning ones, and there is dew on the grass, and the day is forever unproved, where I might have a fertile unknown for a soil about me. — Journal, 22 June 1853\n\nAs I came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my pole, it being now quite dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck stealing across my path, and felt a strange thrill of savage delight, and was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw; not that I was hungry then, except for that wildness which he represented. — Walden\n\nWhat we call wildness is a civilization other than our own. — Journal, 16 February 1859\n\nIn Wildness is the preservation of the World. — \"Walking\"\n\nWe need the tonic of wildness — to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hearing the booming of the snipe; to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close o the ground. — Walden\n\nIt is in vain to dream of a wildness distant from ourselves. There is none such. — Journal, 30 August 1856\n\nThe most alive is the wildest. — \"Walking\"\n\nWhatever has not come under the sway of man is wild. In this sense original and independent men are wild — not tamed and broken by society. — Journal, 3 September 1851\n\nTrench says a wild man is a willed man. Well, then, a man of will who does what he wills or wishes, a man of hope and of the future tense, for not only the obstinate is willed, but far more the constant and persevering. The obstinate man, properly speaking, is one who will not. The perseverance of the saints is positive willedness, not a mere passive willingness. The fates are wild, for they will; and the Almighty is wild above all, as fate is. — Journal, 27 June 1853\n\n"}
