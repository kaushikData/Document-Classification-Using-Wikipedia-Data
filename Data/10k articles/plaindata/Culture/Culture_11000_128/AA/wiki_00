In January of that year, SpaceX first flew a \"Falcon 9 rocket with a 3D-printed Main Oxidizer Valve (MOV) body in one of the nine Merlin 1D engines\". The valve is used to control flow of cryogenic liquid oxygen to the engine in a high-pressure, low-temperature, high-vibration physical environment.\n\nIn 2015–2016, other 3D-printed spacecraft assemblies were ground-tested, including high-temperature, high-pressure rocket engine combustion chambers and the entire mechanical spaceframe and propellant tanks for a small satellite of a few hundred kilograms.\n\nIn June 2014, Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJR) announced that they had \"manufactured and successfully tested an engine which had been entirely 3D printed.\" The \"Baby Banton\" engine is a thrust engine that runs on LOX/kerosene propellant.\nBy March 2015, AJR had completed a series of hot-fire tests for additively manufactured components for its full-size AR-1 booster engine.\n\nThe new United Launch Alliance Vulcan launch vehicle—with first launch no earlier than 2019—is evaluating 3D printing for over 150 parts: 100 polymer and more than 50 metal parts.\n\nBy 2017, a 3D printed rocket engine had successfully launched a rocket to space. when on 25 May 2017, an Electron rocket launched to space from New Zealand that was the first to be powered by a main stage rocket \"engine made almost entirely using 3D printing.\" The Electron's first successful orbital launch was on 21 January 2018.\n\nThe SuperDraco engine that provides launch escape system and propulsive-landing thrust for the Dragon V2 passenger-carrying space capsule is fully printed, and was the first fully printed rocket engine. In particular, the engine combustion chamber is printed of Inconel, an alloy of nickel and iron, using a process of direct metal laser sintering, and operates at a chamber pressure at a very high temperature. The engines are contained in a printed protective nacelle to prevent fault propagation in the event of an engine failure.\nThe SuperDraco engine produces of thrust.\nThe engine completed a full qualification test in May 2014, and is slated to make its first orbital spaceflight in 2018 or 2019.\n\nThe ability to 3D print the complex parts was key to achieving the low-mass objective of the engine. It’s a very complex engine, and it was very difficult to form all the cooling channels, the injector head, and the throttling mechanism. ... [The ability] \"to print very high strength advanced alloys ... was crucial to being able to create the SuperDraco engine.\"\n\nThe rocket engine for the Electron launch vehicle is made nearly entirely using 3D printing.\n\nBy 2014, 3D printing had begun to be used to print the entire mechanical structure and integral propellant tanks of a small spacecraft.\n"}

It is often appended to the beginning of each chapter, book, or canto. They were common during the Renaissance as a way to orient a reader within a large work.\n\nJohn Milton included arguments for each of the twelve books of the second edition of \"Paradise Lost\", published in 1674 (the original ten-book edition of 1667 did not include them). They present a concise but often simplified account of what \"happens\" in the book, though they seem not to be intended to have interpretive value, and they have been only sporadically referenced by critics. The first begins:\n\nThe argument could also be in verse, as in Ludovico Ariosto's \"Orlando Furioso\" or William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. Most arguments included in poems are written by the authors themselves, but in other cases they could be added subsequently by a printer or publisher to an earlier work.\n\nAn example of modern literature using this technique is Vikram Seth's \"A Suitable Boy\" (1993), where each of the 19 sections are described by a rhyming couplet on the table of contents.\n\n"}
{"id": "54250570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54250570", "title": "Authepsa", "text": "Authepsa\n\nIn classic antiquity authepsa or autepsa (, authepses : αὐτός + ἕψω, \"self-boiling\", \"self-cooking\") was a vessel used for water heating. Basically, it was a vase with a central tube used to keep coals.\n\n\"Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities\" describes it as follows:\n\nAUTHEPSA (αὐθέψης), or “self-boiler,” was a vessel used for heating water or keeping it hot. As is well known, both hot and cold water were served by the attendants at well-appointed Roman tables (calidae gelidaeque minister, Juv. 5.63, with Mayor's note). For this purpose vessels were used which cannot have differed much in construction from our modern tea-urns (Böttiger, Sabina, 2.30), and like them might be made of costly materials and in artistic designs (authepsa illa, quam tanto pretio nuper mercatus est, Cic. pro Rose. Amer. 46.133; authepsas argenteas, Lamprid. Heliog. 19). \n\nMany ingenious contrivances for economical and portable cooking have been found at Pompeii and Herculaneum, and are now in the Museo Nazionale (formerly Borbonico) at Naples. It is probable, however, that the authepsa, unlike the \"aënum\" and \"caccabus\", was not used for cooking; and it is rather to be identified with a utensil from the same collection (Mus. Borbon. vol. iii. pl. 63) in the first cut above. This vessel is in bronze, and of very tasteful workmanship: the cylinder in the centre was filled with charcoal, and has a grating which allowed the air to enter and the ashes to escape. The second cut, from Mus. Borbon. vol. v. pl. 44, shows another of more elaborate construction. \n\nThe Russian samovar is likewise explained to mean “self-boiler,” and appears to be little different from the authepsa.\n"}

{"id": "21438575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21438575", "title": "Bass (voice type)", "text": "Bass (voice type)\n\nA bass ( ) is a type of classical male singing voice and has the lowest vocal range of all voice types. According to \"The New Grove Dictionary of Opera\", a bass is typically classified as having a vocal range extending from around the second E below middle C to the E above middle C (i.e., E–E). Its tessitura, or comfortable range, is normally defined by the outermost lines of the bass clef. Categories of bass voices vary according to national style and classification system. Italians favour subdividing basses into the \"basso cantante\" (singing bass), \"basso buffo\" (\"funny\" bass), or the dramatic \"basso profondo\" (low bass). The American system identifies the bass-baritone, comic bass, lyric bass, and dramatic bass. The German \"fach\" system offers further distinctions: Spielbass (Bassbuffo), Schwerer Spielbass (Schwerer Bassbuffo), Charakterbass (Bassbariton), and Seriöser Bass. These classification systems can overlap. Rare is the performer who embodies a single \"fach\" without also touching repertoire from another category.\n\nCultural influence and individual variation create a wide variation in range and quality of bass singers. Parts for basses have included notes as low as the B-flat two octaves and a tone below middle C (B), for example in Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 2 and the Rachmaninov's All-Night Vigil, A below that in Frederik Magle's symphonic suite \"Cantabile\", G below that (e.g. Measure 76 of \"Ne otverzhi mene\" by Pavel Chesnokov) or F below those in \"Kheruvimskaya pesn (Song of Cherubim)\" by Krzysztof Penderecki. Many basso profondos have trouble reaching those notes, and the use of them in works by Slavic composers has led to the colloquial term \"Russian bass\" for an exceptionally deep-ranged basso profondo who can easily sing these notes. Some traditional Russian religious music calls for A (110 Hz) drone singing, which is doubled by A (55 Hz) in the rare occasion that a choir includes exceptionally gifted singers who can produce this very low human voice pitch.\n\nMany British composers such as Benjamin Britten have written parts for bass (such as the first movement of his choral work \"Rejoice in the Lamb\") that center far higher than the bass tessitura as implied by the clef. The \"Harvard Dictionary of Music\" defines the range as being from the E below low C to middle C (i.e. E–C).\n\nThe bass has the lowest vocal range of all voice types, with the lowest tessitura. The low extreme for basses is generally C (two Cs below middle C). However, some extreme bass singers, referred to as basso profondos and oktavists, are able to reach much lower than this.\n\nIn SATB four-part mixed chorus, the bass is the lowest vocal range, below the tenor, alto, and soprano. Voices are subdivided into first bass and second bass with no distinction being made between bass and baritone voices, in contrast to the three-fold (tenor–baritone–bass) categorization of solo voices. The exception is in arrangements for male choir (TTBB) and barbershop quartets (TLBB), which sometimes label the lowest two parts baritone and bass.\n\nWithin opera, the lowest note in the standard bass repertoire is D, sung by the character Osmin in Mozart's \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\", but few roles fall below F. Although Osmin's note is the lowest 'demanded' in the operatic repertoire, lower notes are heard, both written and unwritten: for example, it is traditional for basses to interpolate a low C in the duet \"Ich gehe doch rathe ich dir\" in the same opera; in Richard Strauss' \"Der Rosenkavalier\", Baron Ochs has an optional C (\"Mein lieber Hippolyte\"). The high extreme: a few bass roles in the standard repertoire call for a high F, the one above middle C), but few roles go over F. In the operatic bass repertoire, the highest notes are a G (The Barber in \"The Nose\" by Shostakovich) and, in the aria \"Fra l'ombre e gl'orrori\" in Handel's serenata \"Aci, Galatea e Polifemo\", Polifemo reaches an A.\n\nWithin the bass voice type category are seven generally recognized subcategories: \"basso cantante\" (singing bass), \"hoher\" bass (high bass), \"jugendlicher\" bass (juvenile bass), \"basso buffo\" (\"funny\" bass), \"Schwerer Spielbass\" (dramatic bass), lyric bass, and dramatic \"basso profondo\" (low bass).\n\n\"Basso cantante\" means \"singing bass\". \"Basso cantante\" is a higher, more lyrical voice. It is produced using a more Italianate vocal production, and possesses a faster vibrato, than its closest Germanic/Anglo-Saxon equivalent, the bass-baritone.\n\n\"\" or \"high bass\" or often a dramatic bass-baritone.\n\n\"\" (juvenile bass) denotes the role of a young man sung by a bass, regardless of the age of the singer.\n\n\"Buffo\", literally \"funny\", basses are lyrical roles that demand from their practitioners a solid coloratura technique, a capacity for patter singing and ripe tonal qualities if they are to be brought off to maximum effect. They are usually the blustering antagonist of the hero/heroine or the comic-relief fool in bel canto operas.\n\nEnglish equivalent: dramatic bass\n\n\n\n\"Basso profondo\" (lyric low bass) is the lowest bass voice type. According to J. B. Steane in \"Voices, Singers & Critics\", the basso profondo voice \"derives from a method of tone-production that eliminates the more Italian quick vibrato. In its place is a kind of tonal solidity, a wall-like front, which may nevertheless prove susceptible to the other kind of vibrato, the slow beat or dreaded wobble.\"\n\nEnglish equivalent: dramatic low bass. Dramatic basso profondo is a powerful basso profondo voice.\n\nAll of the Gilbert and Sullivan Savoy operas, except \"Patience\" and \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" have at least one lead bass. Notable roles include: \n\n"}

The series was produced by Redwood Productions in association with D'Angelo-Bullock-Allen Productions. In the United Kingdom, it was shown on BBC One.\n\nThe show centered around a forty-year-old middle school science teacher named John Martin (played by Edelman). While vacationing in Florida, he drinks from a spring which turns out to be the legendary Fountain of Youth sought by Juan Ponce de León. The water changes him into a twelve-year-old boy (played by Rist), and back again.\n\nThe changes occur spontaneously and without warning. Because Martin only sipped the water, the changes are recurring and not permanent; according to legend, had he taken a full drink, he would be age twelve permanently. Only his wife, Marjorie (Joyce Bulifant), and son, Ricky (Mike Darnell), know his secret, though Martin's students (who befriend him as \"Little John\") and his boss, principal Bertha Bottomly (Olive Dunbar), do become suspicious that something unusual is going on. The Martin family explain the younger John as their nephew, staying with them. Throughout the series, \"Big John\" unsuccessfully tries to find a cure for his predicament, but his experiences as \"Little John\" often give him insight into what his students are facing.\n\nTo make the two actors resemble each other more closely, Rist's blond hair was dyed brown, while Edelman wore a hairpiece that partially covered his baldness. Edelman and Rist appeared together in 1977, on the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon.\n\n\nRist had previously worked on Schwartz's \"The Brady Bunch\" during its final season (1973–1974), as the Bradys' cousin, Oliver.\n\nThe complete series was released on DVD (for Regions 1 and 2) in 2009 by Fabulous Films Ltd.

{"id": "151107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151107", "title": "Body Worlds", "text": "Body Worlds\n\nBody Worlds (German title: Körperwelten) is a traveling exposition of dissected human bodies, animals, and other anatomical structures of the body that have been preserved through the process of plastination. Gunther von Hagens developed the preservation process which \"unite[s] subtle anatomy and modern polymer chemistry\", in the late 1970s.\n\nA series of \"Body Worlds\" anatomical exhibitions has toured many countries worldwide, sometimes raising controversies about the sourcing and display of actual human corpses and body parts. Nevertheless, Von Hagens maintains that all human specimens were obtained with full knowledge and consent of the donors before they died, and his organization keeps extensive documentation of this permission. Von Hagens emphasizes both educational and artistic aspects of his complex and innovative dissections, and offers online teaching guides for educators. He also tries to distinguish his efforts from those of competitors who may have been less thorough in obtaining advance permission from their specimen sources.\n\nThe exhibit states that its purpose and mission is the education of laymen about the human body, leading to better health awareness. All the human plastinates are from people who donated their bodies for plastination via a body donation program. Each Body Worlds exhibition contains approximately 25 full-body plastinates with expanded or selective organs shown in positions that enhance the role of certain systems.\n\nTo produce specimens for \"Body Worlds\", von Hagens employs 340 people at five laboratories in three countries, China, Germany and Kyrgyzstan. Each laboratory is categorized by specialty, with the China laboratory focusing on animal specimens. One of the most difficult specimens to create was the giraffe that appears in \"Body Worlds & The Cycle of Life\". The specimen took three years to complete – ten times longer than it takes to prepare a human body. Ten people are required to move the giraffe, because its final weight (like all specimens after plastination) is equal to the original animal.\n\nMore than 200 specimens of real human organs and organ systems are displayed in glass cases, some showing various medical conditions. Some of the specimens, such as the Tai Chi Man, demonstrate interventions, and include prosthetics such as artificial hip joints or heart valves. Also featured is a liver with cirrhosis and the lungs of a smoker and non-smoker are placed side by side. A prenatal display features fetuses and embryos, some with congenital disorders.\n\nBody Worlds exhibitions have received more than 37 million visitors, making them the world's most popular touring attraction. \"Body Worlds\" was first presented in Tokyo in 1995. Body Worlds exhibitions have since been hosted by more than 50 museums and venues in North America, Europe and Asia. \"Body Worlds 2 & The Brain – Our Three Pound Gem\" (concerning the brain and nervous system) opened in 2005 at the California Science Center in Los Angeles. it is showing at the Telus World of Science in Vancouver. Several Body Worlds exhibits (as well as Von Hagens himself) were featured in the 2006 film \"Casino Royale\". Among the plastinates featured were the \"Poker Playing Trio\" (which plays a key role in one scene) and \"Rearing Horse and Rider\".\n\n\"Body Worlds 3 & The Story of the Heart\" (concerning the cardiovascular system) opened on 25 February 2006, at the Houston Museum of Natural Science. On 9 July 2009 this show appeared at the Buffalo Museum of Science in Buffalo, New York. , it is showing at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science in Denver, Colorado. \"Body Worlds 4\" debuted 22 February 2008 at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester in England and was in the Cureghem Cellars in Brussels until March 2009. \"Body Worlds & The Mirror of Time\" (featuring human development and aging) debuted at The O in London in October 2008. \"Körperwelten & Der Zyklus Des Lebens (The cycle of life)\" opened in Heidelberg in January 2009. \"Body Worlds Vital\" was inaugurated at the Universum museum of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 2012.\n\nIn July 2008, the Czech Senate passed a law to address illegal trading in human tissue and ban \"advertising of donation of human cells and tissues for money or similar advantages\".\n\nOn Tuesday 21 April 2009, a French judge ruled concerning the Paris exhibition of \"Our Body: The Universe Within\", that exhibiting dead bodies for profit was a \"violation of the respect owed to them\". \"Under the law, the proper place for corpses is in the cemetery\", said Judge Louis-Marie Raingeard. Raingeard ordered the exhibition to close within 24 hours or face a fine of 20,000 euro (over 26,000 dollars) for each day it stayed open. The judge also ordered authorities to seize the 17 bodies on display and all of the organs on display from an unknown number of people for proper burial. Gunther Von Hagens issued a press statement denying any connection between the closed Chinese exhibition and his Body Worlds franchise. Similar exhibitions had already been successfully staged in Lyon and Marseille.\n\nThe UK Parliament created legislation for exhibits of human remains, including plastinated bodies and body parts, in England and Wales under the Human Tissue Act 2004. This requires a licence to be granted by the Human Tissue Authority. The Human Tissue Act superseded the Anatomy Act 1832, which had been found by an independent commission (The Redfern Report) to be inadequate on contemporary collection and use of human tissues, following the Alder Hey organs scandal. In March 2008, the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry was granted such a licence to hold \"Body Worlds 4\" and a further licence was granted to the exhibition in the O2, London, in 2008.\n\nThe Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006 – which amended the Anatomy Act 1984 – covers Scotland. Under the terms of this Act, licences for the handling of human remains, including display, must be granted directly by the Scottish Ministry.\n\nVarious organizations gave evidence to the Scottish Executive during the consultation process, including the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the Wellcome Trust, and the Museums Association.\n\nVarious legislation has been proposed and enacted in different American states. Most proposals concentrate on issues regarding the sale of human remains and the consent of the donors.\n\nNational legislation on consent and tissue donation issues is expressed in the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (2006) passed by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws which states that \"an anatomical gift of a donor's body or part may be made during the life of the donor for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, or education\" and prohibits trafficking in donated human organs for profit.\n\nIn early 2008, former U.S. Republican Representative W. Todd Akin proposed an amendment to the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 to \"make it unlawful for a person to import plastinated human remains into the United States.\" The President of the American Association of Anatomists has expressed concern that the scope of the act is \"too broad\" and that \"Preventing importation of all plastinated specimens could severely restrict their use for medical education.\". The bill of amendment was not enacted during the 2007–2008 Congressional session.\n\nCalifornia's proposed bill AB1519 (Ma), sponsored by Assemblywoman Fiona Ma, tried to \"require exhibitors to get a county permit; to do so, they would have to prove to county health officials that the people whose cadavers were on display — or their next of kin — had consented\".\n\nAssembly Bill 1519 would have made California the first state to require such proof. It was vetoed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on 26 September 2008.\n\nThe state of Florida prohibits the sale or purchase of human remains and \"Authorizes certain science centers located in this state to transport plastinated bodies into, within, or out of this state and exhibit such bodies for the purpose of public education without the consent of this state's anatomical board if the science center notifies the board of any such transportation or exhibition, as well as the location and duration of any exhibition, at least 30 days before such transportation or exhibition\".\n\nIn January 2009, Rep. Marcus Oshiro introduced two bills prompted by presentation of the BODIES Exhibition in that state.\n\nHB28 Relating to Dead Human Bodies would add to the prohibition against buying dead human bodies, the selling of dead human bodies and defines the term \"dead human body\" to include plastinated bodies and body parts. It would increase the fine for buying or selling a dead human body to up to $5,000.\n\nHB29 Relating to Dead Human Bodies. Would prohibit the commercial display of dead human bodies without a permit from the Department of Health.\n\nIn June 2008, New York State Senate passed legislation regulating body exhibits. A bill that was sponsored by Senator Jim Alesi requires anyone showing an exhibit that uses real human bodies in New York museums to produce a permit detailing their origin.\n\nRepresentative Mike Fleck's proposed bill would require evidence of informed consent from the decedent or relatives of all humans whose remains are put on display.\n\nThe state of Washington considered a bill that would \"require written authorization to display human remains for a commercial purpose\".\n\nReligious groups, including representatives of the Catholic Church and some Jewish rabbis have objected to the display of human remains, stating that it is inconsistent with reverence towards the human body.\n\nIn 2003, while promoting a display in the Hamburg Museum of Erotica, von Hagens announced his intention to create a sex plastinate. In May 2009 he unveiled a plastinate of a couple having sex, intended for a Berlin exhibition.\n\nIn 2007, the Bishop of Manchester launched a campaign to coincide with the opening of Body Worlds in that city, accusing the exhibitors of being \"body snatchers\" and \"robbing the NHS\", arguing that donation of bodies for plastination would deprive the National Health Service of organs for transplant. The site included a government petition calling for \"a review of the law regarding the policies and practices of touring shows involving corpses\".\n\nConsent is a primary focus of discussion. In January 2004, the German news magazine \"Der Spiegel\" reported that von Hagens had acquired corpses of executed prisoners in China; von Hagens countered that he did not know the origin of the bodies, and returned seven disputed cadavers to China. In 2004, von Hagens obtained an injunction against \"Der Spiegel\" for making the claims. Paul Harris, director of North Carolina's State Board of Funeral Services, has stated, \"Somebody at some level of government ought to be able to look at a death certificate, a statement from an embalmer, donation documents... That's a reasonable standard to apply.\" Assemblywoman Fiona Ma (D-San Francisco) said, \"These displays do have important educational benefits, but using bodies against a person's will is unacceptable\".\n\nQuestions raised regarding deceased hospital patients from Kyrgyzstan and executed prisoners from China – were categorically stated to have never been used in a Body Worlds exhibition, according to BodyWorlds. \"Five years ago, customs officers intercepted 56 bodies and hundreds of brain samples sent from the Novosibirsk Medical Academy to von Hagens' lab in Heidelberg, Germany. The cadavers were traced to a Russian medical examiner who was convicted last year of illegally selling the bodies of homeless people, prisoners and indigent hospital patients. Von Hagens was not charged with any wrongdoing, and says his cadavers are obtained only through proper legal and ethical channels.\n\nAn Ethical Commission set up by the California Science Center in Los Angeles in 2004 had the following members: \nReverend Richard Benson, Assistant Prof of Moral Theology and Academic Dean, \nSt. John's Seminar, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles;\nDavid C. Blake, PhD, JD, VP, Mission and Ethics,\nSaint John's Health Center;\nRabbi Morley Feinstein,\nSenior Rabbi, University Synagogue;\nReverend Leonard Jackson,\nAssociate Minister,\nFirst African Methodist Episcopal Church (First AME). \nThey determined that \n\"All the bodies need to be properly donated. Advisors felt that this is the most controversial aspect of the project. Proper body donation should be verified to the Science Center's satisfaction, and involves several components. Several advisors reviewed the Body Donor and felt it should be reviewed to ensure that it meets an adequate standard of disclosure and informed consent. They recommended that the form should be clear to make sure the bodies in the exhibit consented to public display. The source of donated bodies should be verifiable; Ask an independent party to review donor forms, verifying that all bodies are donated properly.; Communicate to guests, near the entrance of the exhibit, that the bodies are donated.\"\nAs an ethical concern, consent is not regulated worldwide according to the same ethics. \"That paperwork is then separated from the bodies, which can be used for displays or sold in pieces to medical schools. No one will know for sure, because each plastinated corpse is made anonymous to protect its privacy.\" Hans Martin Sass, a philosophy professor with a speciality in ethics, was hired by the California Science Center to investigate Body Worlds before the show's U.S. debut in 2004. He matched over 200 donation forms to death certificates, but he did not match the paperwork to specific bodies von Hagens has on display.\n\nInternational trade experts have objected to the way in which bodies for commercial display are imported, because the way their categorization codes (as \"art collections\") do not require Centers for Disease Control stamps or death certificates, both of which are required for medical cadavers. In most countries plastinated human specimens are classified under Customs Classification Code 97050000.48 \"items in anatomical collections\". This customs code encompasses \"zoological, botanical, mineralogical or anatomical collections or items in such collections.\"\n\nIn an ethical analysis, Thomas Hibbs, professor of ethics and culture at Baylor University, a private Baptist-affiliated institution, compared cadaver displays to pornography, in that they reduce the subject to \"the manipulation of body parts stripped of any larger human significance.\"\n\nIn a 2006 lecture entitled \"Plasti-Nation: How America was Won\", Lucia Tanassi, professor of medical ethics and anthropology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, explored questions for ethicists regarding this new scientific frontier. Tanassi called it provocative that ethics committees have contributed to the popularization of the exhibits without setting forth any process of a line of inquiry, pointing to an ethics report from the California Science Center. As part of that review, bioethicist Hans Martin Sass was sent to Heidelberg to match donor consents with death certificates.\n\nConcerns have been expressed about the educational aspects, especially the inclusion of these displays for school field trips. St. Louis Diocese Archbishop Raymond Burke strongly suggested that Catholic Schools avoid scheduling field trips, stating that parents, and not children, should retain the freedom of deciding whether or not their children will view the exhibit. Concerned with how \"some kids process\" these \"graphic\" images, Des McKay, school superintendent in Abbotsford, British Columbia (near Greater Vancouver), barred field trips to exhibits of plasticized human beings. In an editorial to the Abbotsford News, Rev. Christoph Reiners questions what effect the exhibits will have on the values of children attending for school field trips. Others—such as the Catholic Schools Office of Phoenix—acknowledge the educational content of Body Worlds. Reporting on the exhibition at the O2 bubble in 2008/2009, Melanie Reid of The Times stated \"(Body Worlds) should be compulsory viewing for every child of 10 or over\"\n\nVon Hagens maintains copyright control over pictures of his exhibits. Visitors are not allowed to take pictures, and press photographers are required to sign agreements permitting only a single publication in a defined context, followed by a return of the copyright to Von Hagens. Because of a similar agreement applied to sound bites (O-Töne, in German) a German press organization suggested that the press refrain from reporting about the exhibition in Munich in 2003 .\n\nThe Body Worlds website offers plastinated pieces for sale. There are a wide range of products from plastinated fruit jewelry to entire humans. Although some of the pieces require purchasers to be a qualified user—those intending to use the pieces for \"research, educational, medical or therapeutic purposes\"—many pieces, including animal testicles and baby chicks, require no authorization. There are also extremely realistic plastinate impressions of human hearts and slices (including one slice of copulating humans) for sale to the general public.\n\nThe success of Body Worlds has given rise to several similar shows featuring plastinated cadavers, including \"BODIES... The Exhibition\" and \"Our Body: The Universe Within\" in the United States, \"Bodies Revealed\" in the United Kingdom, \"Body Exploration\" in the Republic of China, \"Mysteries of the Human Body\" in South Korea, \"Jintai Plastomic: Mysteries of the Human Body\" in Japan, \"Cuerpos Entrañables\" in Spain.\n\nSome of these contain exhibits very similar to von Hagens' plastinates; Von Hagens has asserted copyright protection, and has sued \"Body Exploration\" and \"Bodies Revealed\".\nThe suits were based on a presumed copyright of certain positions of the bodies, but the counterparty asserts that the human body in its diversity cannot be copyrighted.\n\nSuch lawsuits have not stopped the competition. While the Korean police in Seoul confiscated a few exhibits from \"Bodies Revealed\", the exhibition went on successfully.\n\nSeveral of the competing exhibitions have been organized by the publicly traded US company Premier Exhibitions. They started their first \"Bodies Revealed\" exhibition in Blackpool, England which ran from August through October 2004. In 2005 and 2006 the company opened their \"Bodies Revealed\" and \"BODIES... The Exhibition\" exhibitions in Seoul, Tampa, Miami, New York City, and Seattle. Other exhibition sites in 2006 are Mexico City, Atlanta (GA), London, Great Britain and Las Vegas (Nevada).\n\nUnlike Body Worlds, none of the competing exhibitions or their suppliers have a body donation programme. Dr. Roy Glover, a spokesperson for \"BODIES... The Exhibition\" said all their exhibits use unclaimed cadavers, deposited at the University of Dalian by Chinese authorities. In May 2008, a settlement with the attorney general of New York obliged Premier Exhibitions to offer refunds to visitors when it could not prove consent for the use of the bodies in its exhibitions. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo commented: \"Despite repeated denials, we now know that Premier itself cannot demonstrate the circumstances that led to the death of the individuals. Nor is Premier able to establish that these people consented to their remains being used in this manner.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The skins are commonly masonry, such as brick or concrete block. Masonry is an absorbent material, and therefore will slowly draw rainwater or even humidity into the wall, as well as from the inside of the house as from outside. The cavity serves as a way to drain water back out through weep holes at the base of the wall system or above windows. The weep holes allow wind to create an air stream through the cavity and the stream removes evaporated water from the cavity to the outside. Usually weep holes are created by intentionally leaving several vertical joints, also open head joints, open about two meters apart at the base of in every story. Weep holes are also placed above windows to prevent dry rot of a wooden window frame. A cavity wall with masonry as both inner and outer skins is more commonly referred to as a double wythe masonry wall.\n\nThe typical cavity wall method of construction was introduced in Northwest Europe during the 19th century and gained widespread use from the 1920s. In some early examples stones were used to tie the two leaves of the cavity wall together, while in the 20th century metal ties came into use. Initially cavity widths were extremely narrow and were primarily implemented to prevent the passage of moisture into the interior of the building. The widespread introduction of insulation into the cavity began in the 1970s with it becoming compulsory in building regulations during the 1990s.\n\n\n\nA cavity wall is composed of two masonry walls separated by a continuous air space in between the outer and the inner wall. The outer wall is the brick wall that faces the outside of the building structure.[1] The inner wall, separated from the outer wall by a continuous air space or the cavity, is the wall on the interior of the building structure. The inner wall may be constructed of masonry units such as concrete block, structural clay, brick or in some other cases reinforced concrete.[1]\nThese two walls have to be fastened together with metal ties or bonding blocks.[2] The ties will allow the cavity wall to be strong.\n\nThe water barrier is a thin membrane that will keep moisture away from the cavity side of the interior wall. \n\nIn cavity walls the flashing component is very important for the overall water management of the wall. The main purpose of the flashing is to direct water out of the cavity. Metal flashing will usually extend from the interior wall through the outer wall and a weep hole with a downward curve should be provided in order to get water out. Flashing system in cavity walls are typically located close to the base of the wall, so that it will collect, on the bottom, all the water that goes down the wall.\n\nWeep holes are drainage holes left in the exterior wall of the cavity wall, to provide an exit way for water in the cavity.\n\nExpansion and control joints do not have to be aligned in cavity walls.\n\nIn modern cavity wall construction, cavity insulation is typically added. This construction makes possible to add a continuous insulation layer in between the two wythes and, vertically, through the slabs, which minimizes thermal bridges.\n\nBreathing Performance: Early cavity wall buildings are structures that exchange moisture readily with the indoor and outdoor environment. Materials used in repairs must be selected with care so they do not affect the breathing performance of the materials.[4]\n\nCavity wall insulation installed in older buildings can create problems with moisture retention. [4]\n\nThermal mass cavity walls are thick walls. These help stabilize the interior environment of a building better that the thinner modern walls.[4]\n\nEnvironmental Influences: The orientation or design of a building may affect the performance of different façades on a building. Some walls may receive more rainwater and wind than others depending in their orientation or protection to some of the faces. [4]\n\nDamp: Moisture is one of the main problems in materials weathering. [4]\n\nSalts\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19954182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19954182", "title": "City bicycle", "text": "City bicycle\n\nA city bicycle, urban bicycle, European city bike (ECB), classic bike or simply city-bike, is a bicycle designed for frequent short, moderately paced rides through relatively flat urban areas. It is a form of utility bicycle commonly seen around the world, built to facilitate everyday riding in normal clothes in a variety of weather conditions.\n\nGenerally as they are more suitable for urban environments, they focus more on comfort and practicality instead of speed or efficiency. They normally have a slightly curved, roughly planar aligned and elevated handlebar, providing users an upright sitting position. They have fewer gears and they often are heavier than road bicycles. They might have the top central frame bar diagonally aligned for allowing easy mounting in and out and they might have a back or front frame for transport of items. The saddle is typically larger compared with other bicycles and the majority is provided with chain and tires protections against oil or dirt.\n\nCity bikes may be individually owned or operated as part of a public bike sharing scheme.\n\nThe Dutch term \"Stadsfiets\" is a useful starting point for defining the nature of the design, as it has the full set of features commonly incorporated into a European city bike. The Dutch words \"fiets\" and \"stadsfiets\" mean \"bicycle\" and \"city bicycle\", respectively. A \"stadsfiets\" is considered to be a fully outfitted European city bike, distinguished by the following typical features: upright riding position, fully enclosed chaincase, skirtguard, O-lock, hub gearing, dynamo hub, manually operated small warning bell, and built-in lights.\n\nGerman and Dutch versions of the European city bike are similar, though there are differences.\n\nThe \"English roadster\" is similar in design, appearance, and intended use. The primary differences are that the continental bicycles tend to have a higher handlebar position for a more upright riding posture, and are more likely to have rod-actuated drum brakes. Because of Great Britain's cultural and trading influence in its former colonies, the roadster can still be seen in local production and use in many countries of the world.\n\nA traditional-styled European city bike includes a frame made of low-carbon high-tensile steel, black paint with chromed accessories, an opaque skirtguard, bottle dynamo, simple dynamo-powered lights, and either a single-speed or 3-speed internally geared hub.\n\nContemporary city bikes are increasingly found in many European cities, including Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Dutch and Danish-made city bikes often include such features as a clear skirt guard, colors other than black, aluminum alloy or chromoly steel frame, front suspension fork, suspension seatpost, Hub dynamo, dynamo lighting with motion-and-darkness detection, magnetic lights, a 7- or 8-speed hub, adjustable kickstand, child seats, and a headlight integrated into the front fork. Newer German models, on the other hand, tend to incorporate a \"less is more\" philosophy.\n\nThe following bicycles provide most or all of the features are commonly found in The Netherlands or Denmark on a city bike:\n\nWhile differing in many details, some American bicycle manufacturers have incorporated some features of traditional European city bikes in models such as:\n\nThe suitability and availability of fully outfitted city bikes depends on multiple factors, including local terrain, city density, car traffic, weather, and bicycle infrastructure. Traditional European city bikes are optimized for short-distance, frequent transportation over flat terrain in urban settings. However, such bikes are also used in hilly Switzerland, including Basel and Bern, where 23% and 15% of daily trips are made by bicycle respectively.\n\nA fully outfitted European city bike or heavy utility roadster typically weighs 35–50 pounds (16–23 kg), compared with 14–22 pounds (6–10 kg) for the average road racing bike and 22–29 pounds (10–13 kg) for the typical modern mountain bike, touring bicycle, or hybrid city bike, commuter, or cross bike. A steel-frame European city bike with hub gear, chain case, and other features is heavier and more difficult to ride uphill than a road bike. A steel-frame bike is more cumbersome to carry and store, so it might not be the best choice for commuters needing to transport their bicycles on public transportation nor cyclists living or working in upper floor residences. Instead, European city bikes are often locked and stored outside businesses or residences, even during inclement weather. For easier carrying and storage, makers of European city bikes provide features similar to city bikes on folding bicycles. In the Netherlands, many modern city bikes are also available with an aluminum alloy frame, significantly reducing weight to partly overcome the practical difficulties with a heavier bike.\nIn the United States, Americans living in cities or suburbs with many days of sunshine per year have traditionally used road racing bicycles, sport/touring bicycles, or mountain bikes for general commuting or utility purposes. For all-weather use, U.S. buyers tend to purchase substantially lighter machines than the traditional \"Stadsfiets\" or utility roadster, instead choosing hybrid city bikes or commuter bikes derived from road or mountain designs. The latter frequently employ lightweight frames and wide gear ranges for use on higher-speed roadways as well as steep terrain. To save weight, some hybrid city or commuter bikes do not usually possess many accessories, adding only fenders, a rack, and perhaps a partial chainguard, as well as front and rear lights. Their smaller bulk and lighter weight often permits them to be carried into offices and residences, an advantage in countries with extremely high rates of bicycle vandalism and theft (even of older or obsolete models with little monetary value).\n\nMost European city bikes are designed to withstand year-round outdoor storage, even in frigid Scandinavia where daily bike usage remains high year-round. Thus, European city bikes need not always be brought indoors and can be left outside, properly locked. To deter theft and vandalism, the European city bike has a tougher frame, non-quick-release seat and wheels, and a rear-wheel lock. To prevent theft or vandalism, it is ideal to bring the bike indoors, but this isn't always possible in dense cities with compact living quarters.\n\nMuch like the English \"sports roadster\", a lighter-weight variant of the contemporary European city bike adheres to the same general approach to bike design and use, but saves weight and increases efficiency by using:\n\nThe lightweight European city bike is a popular model for Dutch brands such as Batavus and Gazelle, where high levels of bicycle use result in demand for higher performance city bicycles, which is otherwise similar to the fully outfitted typical European city bike. This is sometimes marketed as a \"sports\" variant of the latter.\n\nA hub gear is an important feature of a European city bike. A hub gear system provides greater ease-of-use than a derailleur system due to the ability to change gear stationery, smooth changes, the ability to provide a wide range of ratios, and the requirement of little maintenance.\n\nA geared hub requires only one shifter rather than two, thus is easier to use than the pair of derailleurs which provide a greater number of speeds to sporting bicycles that need them. A European city bike or roadster typically has 3, 5, 7, 8 or 11 speeds. In a few high-end models, a Rohloff 14-speed geared hub is available. Batavus makes several models of full-featured city bikes that have a NuVinci hub with continuously variable drive ratio. The \"NuVinci\" has nearly the same range as an 8-speed hub (around 300%), selectable at any ratio within the range. With most bikes, the bicycle gearing may be scaled up or down as needed, for example by installing a smaller chainring in front and/or larger sprocket in back to facilitate climbing.\n\nHub gearing permits the use of a fully enclosed chaincase, which minimizes the need for maintenance. A hub gear has lower efficiency than a clean, properly adjusted derailleur system, but retains its efficiency without conscientious cleaning and adjustment. A hub gear system is heavier than a derailleur system. In a hub gear system, the main moving parts are enclosed, making repair more difficult than with a derailleur system. If a geared hub fails, it is sometimes more economical to replace the hub than attempt to repair it.\n\nA European city bike has angled-back handlebars and an upright riding position. The handlebars, similar to the North Road style handlebars, have a moderate rise and are swept back toward the body, enabling a fully upright posture similar to a person walking. The rider is easily visible to other traffic and can easily see traffic and hazards.\n\nThe handlebar's shape allows shopping bags, locks, and other items to be hung from the bars without slipping off. This reduces steering control, but that is compensated by the more stable geometry of the frame and forks.\n\nA curved fork and angled vertical tubing provides stable, non-twitchy steering, enabling the rider to ride with one hand, while freeing the other hand for signalling or to secure a load on the rear rack. Europeans commonly use the free hand to hold an umbrella or cell phone, or to hold the shoulder of a child riding their own bike, to train the child for positioning on the road. A coaster brake further enables such one-handed riding, because the one hand on the handlebar only has to steer, not also brake.\n\nA stable European city bike enables securely travelling along in a position that is as upright as walking; it feels stable and relaxed, like walking very fast. A safe city bike needs to be capable of easily turning without falling over, and needs to be capable of moving reliably with shopping bags and a lock hanging from the handlebars.\n\nA hub dynamo enables a built-in lighting system without the loud noise and high drag of a bottle (sidewall) dynamo, and without the unreliability, high cost, ecological disposal problem, and maintenance inherent with batteries. The hub dynamo powers LED or halogen front and rear lights. The lights have a built-in reflector. The taillight is mounted cleanly on the rear rack or fender. A built-in reflector in the headlight and taillight surrounds or is adjacent to the LED or light bulb. Built-in lights stay on point, i.e., need no adjustments.\n\nThe latest systems include a capacitor-powered standlight, powered for a few minutes by a capacitor. This prevents the lights from going out as soon as the bike speed drops to less than a few miles per hour; this evens out the amount of light at various speeds, sustaining the light at lower speeds.\n\nThe latest systems include automatic switching based on darkness+motion detection. This prevents having to reach to physically position a bottle dynamo or consume set-up time; this enables ready, guaranteed lighting regardless of the daylight conditions. A three-position switch has positions for Off, On, and Auto. A hub dynamo prevents the usage-overhead and preparation time of attaching the headlight and taillight to the bike prior to using the bike, and prevents having to remove the headlight and taillight and carry them while the bicycle is parked in public. A built-in light system avoids a failing battery lamp and prevents getting a ticket and fine from having no lights at night.\n\nMany Danish bikes feature lights powered through electromagnetic induction. The lights are mounted on the bike wheels, eliminating the need for batteries while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos.\n\nA front suspension fork is common on high-end, contemporary-styled European city bikes. This is often a coil/oil or air/oil suspension fork with adjustable compression and rebound. A traditional roadster has no front suspension, or a spring-based front suspension that has more limited travel and adjustability.\n\nSome high-end models integrate the headlight into the front fork and fender assembly. This discourages vandalism, protects the wiring, and reduces the number of external wires and cables.\n\nA built-in O-lock is a type of bicycle lock that prevents ride-off theft, establishes ownership, secures the back wheel to the frame (which can be separately locked), and provides a lock and slot for a cable. An O-lock is also called a ring lock or wheel lock.\n\nThe O-lock facilitates outdoor parking, by reducing the risk that someone can steal the bike by quickly riding off on it. An O-lock is lightweight and unobtrusive. It can be locked very quickly and conveniently, such as when parking the bike outside a store while running errands.\n\nThe O-lock also serves as a deterrent to ownership disputes, as the person who has the O-lock key is proven to be the owner of the bike. More recent O-locks have a slot to attach an armored cable, allowing a cyclist to lock the frame, wheels, and seat.\n\nO-locks provide a limited degree of security, like all locks. The greatest security requires using multiple types of locks together. In Copenhagen and Japan, the O-lock is generally used alone; the bikes are insured against theft and the owner must show that they have the key, to demonstrate that the bike was locked. The key can only be removed by locking the lock. In other locations, the O-lock is used along with locking the frame to a secure object, or the O-lock is used alone when the owner is very close by, to prevent ride-off theft.\n\nA skirt guard (or coatguard) allows using the bike with normal clothes, for both the main rider and a passenger riding on the back rack. The skirt guard helps enable riding in cold and rain because it allows easy use of a coat, cloak, dress, skirt, scarf, or luggage; winter biking becomes possible in conjunction with wearing more clothing and using a skirtguard and chaincase. It also enables transporting various materials on the rack without getting caught in the spokes.\n\nA skirtguard prevents winter or flowing spring clothing from getting caught in the area where many features converge: the back brake, O-lock, and spokes. The skirtguard and O-lock form an integrated system. The O-lock catches clothing, so the skirtguard is needed to compensate. The O-lock passes through a hole in the skirt guard. The traditional, old-fashioned city bike has a solid (opaque) fabric skirt guard, while the contemporary European city bike has a clear plastic guard.\n\nA fully enclosed chain guard or chaincase enables using the bike with normal clothes and no preparation activity, such as wearing trouser clips or rolling up a trouser leg. A full guard prevents oil stains on clothes, and keeps trouser legs from getting caught in the chain or front chainring. While newer designs may use a partial chain guard, the latter still permits the chain to occasionally catch and stain loose trouser legs if not secured.\n\nA full chain guard also keeps the drive train (chain and external gears) clean and efficient by excluding water, mud, and grit which could splash onto the chain and front chainring, increase wear, and reduce drivetrain efficiency. To repair a rear flat tire, a fully enclosed chain guard must be partially disassembled to remove the back wheel, or the tire must be repaired in-place without removing the wheel.\n\nThe fenders are aluminum or plastic, sometimes with a taillight affixed to the bottom of the back fender. The fairly low bottom of the back fender reduces road grime splashing up to a cyclist who is following behind. Integrated fenders designed into the bike provide a clean, safe attachment, and match the bike frame.\n\nEnclosed drum brakes or a rear coaster brake are used on most European city bikes, rather than rim brakes. A bike with drum brakes is optimized for stopping in wet weather: in wet weather, drum brakes provide more stopping power and reliability than rim brakes; but in dry weather, less.\n\nEnclosed drum brakes require infrequent maintenance, compared to rim brakes or disc brakes, and are more durable than disc brakes, which are exposed.\n\nDrum brakes are best suited for slower, moderate use, rather than longer periods of hard downhill braking while carrying a load. Under such heavy braking, drum brakes are reported to sometimes fade, losing stopping power, while rim brakes can overheat the rim and cause a tire blowout. A common model of drum brake is the Shimano Rollerbrake, which includes a mechanism to prevent the drum brake from suddenly catching and grabbing more than intended.\n\nDrum brakes are heavier than rim brakes.\n\nA Dutch convention is to carry a passenger on the back rack, the passenger balancing side-saddle. The sturdy rack supports passenger weight, to carry a passenger and sustain a launch without collapsing. A standard strap assembly attaches cleanly to the rack, providing useful transport capability. There are standard notches for a strap assembly with 2 to 4 elastic straps. The rack is integrated into the bike design; the taillight is usually mounted on the back of the rack.\n\nDanish bikes are usually equipped with a back rack with a spring-loaded clamp.\n\nA kickstand is present, and is often dual-leg or a center-stand for stability while the bike is carrying children or a load. Alternately, an adjustable-length kickstand enables parking regardless of the slope and load.\n\nTires are puncture-resistant for travelling without a pump and tools to fix a flat tire. Width is normally medium to wide (1.5-1.75 inches; 38–44 mm), providing a balance of speed with durability and cushioning. These are semi-slick road tires with shallow tread, such as Schwalbe Marathon tires. Such tires are faster and quieter than mountain-bike tires, and more durable and reliable than road-racing tires. Reflective bands on the sidewalls make the wheels visible as wheels, not just as small reflectors. This makes the bike more visible from side at night by cars without using reflective clothing and extra lights.\n\nLarge 28\", 700 B or 700 C wheels are typical, providing a smoother ride than 26\" wheels. On traditional Dutch city bikes, extremely thick spokes add carrying strength. To discourage theft, the front and back wheels use axle bolts instead of quick-releases. European city bikes are used in bike-friendly areas for short distances with sturdy tires. These features are suited to riding without tools or quick-release wheels.\n\nThe platform pedals allow use with normal shoes.\n\nThe saddle is typically moderately broad, softly cushioned, and is often suspended. A non quick-release seat prevents having to lock or remove the seat to prevent theft.\n\nA bell is standard equipment for bikes in Europe, and is required by law in some European countries, such as Denmark, Poland and Germany. Additional features are available, such as front and rear bicycle reflectors, baskets, child seats and a windshield.\n\nIn 1997, then President of the United States Bill Clinton was given a European city bike named \"City Bike One\" as a memento of his visit to Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n"}
{"id": "31631748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31631748", "title": "Comic book therapy", "text": "Comic book therapy\n\nComic book therapy is a form of art therapy in which those undergoing rehabilitation or those who have already completed rehabilitation express their experiences through personal narratives within a comics format. The combination of text and image enables patients to process their memories and emotions through two different, yet compatible mediums. Comic book therapy can also be used in a psychotherapeutic setting, whereby clients are encouraged to read specific comic books, often surrounding topics similar to their own diagnoses. Clients are encouraged to present their thoughts and feelings they experienced while reading as well as to draw parallels with their own lived experiences based on the events that occur within the books. This is done in an effort to reach a cathartic moment of clarity and understanding of one's own life.\n\nBoth forms of therapy can be used throughout a patient's treatment process: immediately after diagnosis, throughout rehabilitation, and during the events that follow, including readjustment and general coping.\n\nComic book therapy is currently being applied to a variety of populations, including patients diagnosed with life-altering diagnoses (i.e. cancer, Dementia, Parkinson's Disease, diabetes, etc.), patients and family members experiencing severe illness or death, families undergoing therapy, sexual assault survivors, and soldiers returning from war. One such therapy, originally conceptualized by Captain Russel Shilling, is currently being developed by The United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).\n\nGraphic medicine, originally coined by Ian Williams, is a literary genre that combines the medium of comics and the discourse of medicine. Within the last ten years, graphic stories, which are also referred to as adult themed comics, have slowly become a rising pop-culture trend. It owes its success in part to the rise of medical humanities, an interdisciplinary study of medicine and healthcare related topics. While medical humanities incorporates a variety of language-based subjects (i.e. philosophy, ethics, religion, etc.), graphic medicine strives to analyze the same healthcare-related topics using an artistic lens. The genre combines the conventionality of text with the eccentricity of images to present intimate narratives related to healthcare or medical experiences. These narratives are also sometimes referred to as \"graphic pathologies\", as they commonly discuss diagnoses of injury, illness, or disease.\n\nCurrent professionals within the field are striving to develop a collection of novels that can act not only as a therapeutic tool for patients and their loved ones, but that serve as an educational tool for medical students as well.\n\nThe general concepts of graphic medicine and comic book therapy are often used interchangeably as they both strive to develop healthcare-related stories using both text and graphics. There is however a distinction that should be made. Graphic medicine acts as an umbrella term that encompasses a host of therapeutic techniques. Therefore, comic book therapy comfortably fits under its heading as just one of many therapies that the field of graphic medicine investigates.\n\nThe foundations of the comics industry began in the early 1920's just after the culmination of the First World War. Initially starting out as small black-and-white strips, comics predominantly acted as entertaining filler space within national and local magazines and newspapers around the country. It was not until 1929 with the publication of \"The Funnies #1\" that the first collection of comics material came about. The years following witnessed a spurt of comics publication that lasted up until present day with children and adults alike still knowing names like \"Batman, Superman, Peanuts,\" and \"Calvin and Hobbes.\"\n\nProfessionals within the graphic medicine field trace the history of comics back further than the early 1920's, however. Instead, they claim the origin of their academic field can be traced back to prehistoric cave drawings and man's desire to express himself with pictures. In this light, professors of graphic medicine and clinicians of comic book therapy include Egyptian hieroglyphics, Mayan and Aztecs drawings, and the great art of the Greeks, the Persians, and the Romans within the history of comic books as well. They do, of course, begin the story of comics specifically in 1938 with the publication of \"Action Comics #1\", the first to detail the adventures and heroic efforts of Superman. The development of radio, television, and film only heightened the popularity of comic books and comic book characters; and by 1980, the merchandising of comic books hit an all time peak. Today, comic books have slowly begun to matriculate within select topics of academia, now regarded as significant contributions to literary expression, covering topics of medicine, politics, economy, and social change.\n\nSince its beginning, graphic medicine as a field of study has steadily become more relevant. As such, the use of comic book therapy as well as its functions have expanded as well. Today, comic books and graphic novels alike are being implemented in a variety of clinical and educational settings, likely due to its efforts in serving a variety of needs for a diverse target audience. Comic book therapies can serve multiple purposes. Some authors hope to relay information, creating a graphic encyclopedia of sorts. Therapists often collaborate with patients in comic book therapy to develop a closer relationship based on the tenants of empathy and understanding. Patients, more often than not, are encouraged to process difficult emotions and memories in the attempt to process, readjust, and engage in healthier coping strategies. Because of its multiple functions, graphic medicine and comic book therapy have been implemented both therapeutically and educationally in the medical field.\n\nOne form of comic book therapy involves the creation of a comic strip, a comic book, or a graphic novel. The process by which a patient, family member, caregiver, or practitioner creates a comic book is complex and involves extensive research. In essence, the process of developing a comic book serves as a therapeutic coping mechanism that goes beyond text-based story telling. Instead, patients are pushed to think through multiple mediums. The process can sometimes, hopefully frequently, lead to significant cognitive and emotion breakthroughs. These effects are likely due to the sheer versatility of the comic book medium, as they allow for the simultaneous expression of body image, verbal expression, physical action, and emotion.\n\nTherapists often encourage patients to develop characters first, as this first step situates the patient in relation to their environment, past and present. Most often, the characters of comic book therapy novels imitate those within the author's own life, developing an autobiography of sorts. Occasionally, their experiences are identical to those of reality; often, an author chooses to reshape the narrative altogether, providing the reader an augmented reality of some kind. Patients take this opportunity to rewrite their story, making choices they didn't or couldn't during their own experiences. The comic book aspect acts as a safe avenue of release, in which a patient can comfortably create a world in which the consequences of actions are limited to panels in which they develop.\n\nAnother form of comic book therapy encourages patients, their support systems, and their healthcare providers to read already published graphic novels and comic books. As the field of graphic medicine has grown, so too have the collection of comic books and novels. As such, current graphic novels and comic books cover a wide range of topics, including cancer, Parkinson's disease, Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, eating disorders, and so on. Popular novels include \"Cancervixen: a True Story\" by Marisa Acocella Marchetto, \"Tangles: A Story About Alzheimer's, My Mother, and Me\" by Sarah Leavitt, and \"Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo and Me\" by Ellen Forney. Therapists recommend novels that discuss similar experiences, similar diagnoses, similar personal histories to those of their own patients. Patients are encouraged to read them critically in the efforts of finding some kind of parallel between their own experiences and those described within the panels. This method of therapy goes beyond just reading a recommended autobiography. The images and graphics within each panel add to the narrative, bridging a gap between words and meaning. The way in which an author chooses to depict their characters, the environment, and the text are all important and contribute largely the reading experience.\n\nCurrent professionals within the field are striving to develop a field of study that can act not only as a therapeutic tool for patients and healthcare providers alike, but that can serve as an educational tool for medical students as well. With the advancement of technology and the diversification of the patient population, medical practices has undergone significant change within the last century. On the other hand, the education process prior to medical practice has remained arguably stagnant. Present day medical school programs cover material in three broad categories, including the scientific basis of medicine, patient care, and physicianship. The methods of teaching vary across universities, but the basic curricula remain the same across the board. With the evolution of medical practice arriving so quickly, some argue that medical training should follow in suit. According to the scholars of Graphic Medicine, there are multiple parallels between comic book therapy, when used as educational tool, and the everyday practice of medicine. In this way, having medical students engage in comic book therapy during their medical training could prove significant later on. The hustle and bustle of medical practice can prove stressful, especially for a new doctor fresh out of medical school. In order to prove oneself within the medical field, many believe an individual must possess characteristics like 'competency', 'professionalism', and 'brilliance'; rarely are physicians referred to as 'artistically creative' or 'creative' at all. One professor of graphic medicine believes this could be a problem in the future as it pushes medical students to stay within the limitations of an unoriginal box.\n\n"}

{"id": "5700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5700", "title": "Cross-dressing", "text": "Cross-dressing\n\nCross-dressing is the act of wearing items of clothing and other accoutrements commonly associated with the opposite sex within a particular society. Cross-dressing has been used for purposes of disguise, comfort, and self-expression in modern times and throughout history.\n\nAlmost every human society throughout history has had expected norms for each gender relating to style, color, or type of clothing they are expected to wear, and likewise most societies have had a set of guidelines, views or even laws defining what type of clothing is appropriate for each gender.\n\nThe term \"cross-dressing\" refers to an action or a behavior without attributing or implying any specific causes for that behavior. It is often assumed that the connotation is directly correlated with behaviors of transgender identity or sexual, fetishist, and homosexual behavior, but the term itself does not imply any motives and is not synonymous to one's gender identity.\n\nCross-dressing has been practiced throughout much of recorded history and in many societies. There are many examples in Greek, Norse, and Hindu mythology. A reasonable number of historical figures are known to have cross-dressed to varying degrees and for a variety of reasons. There is a rich history of cross-dressing found in folklore, literature, theater, and music. Examples include Kabuki and Korean shamanism.\n\nIt was once considered taboo in Western society for women to wear clothing traditionally associated with men, except when done in certain circumstances such as cases of necessity (as per St. Thomas Aquinas's guidelines in \"Summa Theologiae II\"), which states: \"Nevertheless this may be done sometimes without sin on account of some necessity, either in order to hide oneself from enemies, or through lack of other clothes, or for some similar motive.\" Cross-dressing is cited as an abomination in the Bible in the book of Deuteronomy (22:5), which states: \"A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor a man wear women’s clothing, for the Lord your God detests anyone who does this\", but as Aquinas noted above this principle was interpreted to be based on context. Other people in the Middle Ages occasionally disputed its applicability; for instance, the 15th-century French poet Martin le Franc, wrote:\n\n<poem>Don't you see that it was forbidden\nThat anyone should eat of an animal\nUnless it had a cleft foot\nAnd chewed its cud?\nTo eat of a hare no one dared\nNeither of sow nor of piglet,\nYet should you now be offered any,\nYou would take many a morsel.</poem>\nHowever, women had to disguise themselves as men in order to participate in the wider world. For example, Margaret King cross-dressed in the early nineteenth century to attend medical school, as none would accept female students. While this prohibition remained in force in general throughout the Middle Ages and early modern era, this is no longer the case and Western women are often seen wearing trousers, ties, and men's hats. Nevertheless, many cultures around the world still prohibit women from wearing trousers or other traditionally male clothing.\n\nCross-dressing in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spain was frequent among actors, and the theater was at the time the most popular form of entertainment. There was a fascination with female cross-dressers particularly (women dressed as men), who were \"extremely popular\" in the \"Golden Age \"Comedia\"\". Male actors might play the \"women dressed as men\" parts. Spain eventually found this cross-dressing to be threatening to social order, and passed laws targeting female transvestites throughout the 1600s. Despite the negative reactions and disapproval, it continued to remain very popular in the \"comedia\".\n\nThere are many different kinds of cross-dressing and many different reasons why an individual might engage in cross-dressing behavior. Some people cross-dress as a matter of comfort or style, out of personal preference for clothing associated with the opposite sex. In this case, a person's cross-dressing may or may not be apparent to other people. Some people cross-dress to shock others or challenge social norms.\n\nGender disguise has been used by women and girls to pass as male in society and by men and boys to pass themselves off as female. Gender disguise has also been used as a plot device in storytelling and is a recurring motif in literature, theater, and film. It is a common plot device in narrative ballads. Historically, some women have cross-dressed to take up male-dominated or male-exclusive professions, such as military service. Conversely, some men have cross-dressed to escape from mandatory military service or as a disguise to assist in political or social protest, as men did in the Rebecca Riots.\n\nGender disguise has also been used by women in modern times to pass as a male soldier in battle reenactments. In 1989, Lauren Burgess dressed as a male soldier in a U.S. National Park service reenactment of the Battle of Antietam, and was ejected after she was discovered to be a woman. Burgess sued the Park Service for sexual discrimination. The case spurred spirited debate among Civil War buffs. In 1993, a federal judge ruled in Burgess's favor.\n\nUndercover journalism may require cross-dressing, as with Norah Vincent's project \"Self-Made Man\".\n\nSingle-sex theatrical troupes often have some performers who cross-dress to play roles written for members of the opposite sex (travesti). Cross-dressing, particularly the depiction of males wearing dresses, is often used for comic effect onstage and on-screen.\n\nDrag is a special form of performance art based on the act of cross-dressing. A drag queen is usually a male-assigned person who performs as an exaggeratedly feminine character, in heightened costuming sometimes consisting of a showy dress, high-heeled shoes, obvious make-up, and wig. A drag queen may imitate famous female film or pop-music stars. A faux queen is a female-assigned person employing the same techniques.\n\nA drag king is a counterpart of the drag queen but usually for much different audiences, and is defined as a female-assigned person who adopts a masculine persona in performance or imitates a male film or pop-music star. Some female-assigned people undergoing gender reassignment therapy also self-identify as \"drag kings\" although this use of \"drag king\" would generally be considered inaccurate.\nA transvestic fetishist is a person (typically a heterosexual male) who cross-dresses as part of a sexual fetish.\n\nThe term \"underdressing\" is used by male cross-dressers to describe wearing female undergarments under their male clothes. The famous low-budget film-maker Edward D. Wood, Jr. said he often wore women's underwear under his military uniform during World War II.\n\nSome people who cross-dress may endeavor to project a complete impression of belonging to another gender, including mannerisms, speech patterns, and emulation of sexual characteristics. This is referred to as passing or \"trying to pass\" depending how successful the person is. An observer who sees through the cross-dresser's attempt to pass is said to have \"read\" or \"clocked\" them. There are videos, books, and magazines on how a man may look more like a woman.\n\n\"Female masking\" is a form of cross-dressing in which men wear masks that present them as female.\n\nSometimes either member of a heterosexual couple will cross-dress in order to arouse the other. For example, the male might wear skirts or lingerie and/or the female will wear boxers or other male clothing. (See also forced feminization)\n\nOthers may choose to take a mixed approach, adopting some feminine traits and some masculine traits in their appearance. For instance, a man might wear both a dress and a beard. This is sometimes known as \"genderfuck\". In a broader context, crossdressing may also refer to other actions undertaken to pass as a particular sex, such as packing (accentuating the male crotch bulge) or, the opposite, tucking (concealing the male crotch bulge).\n\nThe actual determination of cross-dressing is largely socially constructed. For example, in Western society, trousers have long been adopted for usage by women, and it is no longer regarded as cross-dressing. In cultures where men have traditionally worn skirt-like garments such as the kilt or sarong, these are not seen as female clothing, and wearing them is not seen as cross-dressing for men. As societies are becoming more global in nature, both men's and women's clothing are adopting styles of dress associated with other cultures.\nCosplaying may also involve cross-dressing, for some females may wish to dress as a male, and vice versa (see Crossplay). Breast binding (for females) is not uncommon and is one of the things likely needed to cosplay a male character.\n\nIn most parts of the world it remains socially disapproved for men to wear clothes traditionally associated with women. Attempts are occasionally made, e.g. by fashion designers, to promote the acceptance of skirts as everyday wear for men. Cross-dressers have complained that society permits women to wear pants or jeans and other masculine clothing, while condemning any man who wants to wear clothing sold for women.\n\nWhile creating a more feminine figure, male cross-dressers will often utilize different types and styles of breast forms, which are silicone prostheses traditionally used by women who have undergone mastectomies to recreate the visual appearance of a breast.\n\nWhile most male cross-dressers utilize clothing associated with modern women, some are involved in subcultures that involve dressing as little girls or in vintage clothing. Some such men have written that they enjoy dressing as femininely as possible, so they wear frilly dresses with lace and ribbons, bridal gowns complete with veils, as well as multiple petticoats, corsets, girdles and/or garter belts with nylon stockings.\n\nCross-dressers may begin wearing clothing associated with the opposite sex in childhood, using the clothes of a sibling, parent, or friend. Some parents have said they allowed their children to cross-dress and, in many cases, the child stopped when they became older. The same pattern often continues into adulthood, where there may be confrontations with a spouse. Married cross-dressers experience considerable anxiety and guilt if their spouse objects to their behavior. Sometimes cross-dressers have periodically disposed of all their clothing, a practice called \"purging\", only to start collecting other gender's clothing again.\n\nThe historical associations of maleness with power and femaleness with submission and frivolity mean that in the present time a woman dressing in men's clothing and a man dressing in women's clothing evoke very different responses. A woman dressing in men's clothing is considered to be a more acceptable activity.\n\nAdvocacy for social change has done much to relax the constrictions of gender roles on men and women, but they are still subject to prejudice from some people. It is noticeable that as 'transgender' is becoming more socially accepted as a normal human condition, the prejudices against cross-dressing are changing quite quickly, just as the similar prejudices against homosexuals have changed rapidly in recent decades.\n\nThe reason it is so hard to have statistics for female-assigned cross-dressers is that the line where cross-dressing stops and cross-dressing begins has become blurred, whereas the same line for men is as well defined as ever. This is one of the many issues being addressed by third wave feminism as well as the modern-day masculist movement.\n\nThe general culture has very mixed views about cross-dressing. A woman who wears her husband's shirt to bed is considered attractive while a man who wears his wife's nightgown to bed may be considered transgressive. Marlene Dietrich in a tuxedo was considered very erotic; Jack Lemmon in a dress was considered ridiculous. All this may result from an overall gender role rigidity for males; that is, because of the prevalent gender dynamic throughout the world, men frequently encounter discrimination when deviating from masculine gender norms, particularly violations of heteronormativity. A man's adoption of feminine clothing is often considered a going down in the gendered social order whereas a woman's adoption of what are traditionally men's clothing (at least in the English-speaking world) has less of an impact because women have been traditionally subordinate to men, unable to affect serious change through style of dress. Thus when a male cross-dresser puts on his clothes, he transforms into the quasi-female and thereby becomes an embodiment of the conflicted gender dynamic. Following the work of Butler, gender proceeds along through ritualized performances, but in male cross-dressing it becomes a performative \"breaking\" of the masculine and a \"subversive repetition\" of the feminine.\n\nPsychoanalysts today do not regard cross-dressing by itself as a psychological problem, unless it interferes with a person's life. \"For instance,\" said Dr. Joseph Merlino, senior editor of \"Freud at 150: 21st Century Essays on a Man of Genius\", \"[suppose that]...I'm a cross-dresser and I don't want to keep it confined to my circle of friends, or my party circle, and I want to take that to my wife and I don't understand why she doesn't accept it, or I take it to my office and I don't understand why they don't accept it, then it's become a problem because it's interfering with my relationships and environment.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The game is a spin-off of the \"Danganronpa\" series of visual novel games, set between the events of \"\" and \"\". The game was released in Japan on September 25, 2014 and was released by NIS America in North America on September 1, 2015, in Europe on September 4, 2015, and in Australia on September 10, 2015. The game was released on the Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 worldwide in 2017.\n\nUnlike the visual novel gameplay of the previous games, \"Ultra Despair Girls\" is a third-person adventure game with horror elements, in which players control Komaru Naegi as she tries to survive in a city overrun by Monokuma robots. Komaru is armed with a megaphone-shaped Hacking Gun that can use various types of Truth Bullet, which are unlocked as the game progresses. Using the Hacking Gun, Komaru can perform various actions, such as attacking enemies, taking control of them, activating certain machinery, or scanning the environment for clues or hidden items. During the course of the game, Komaru is also assisted by the first game's Toko Fukawa, who uses a stun gun to switch over to her split personality, the serial killer Genocide Jack. When the stun gun is charged up, players can temporarily take control of Jack, who can attack with razor sharp scissors. Attacking enemies fills up the \"Scissor Fever\" gauge, allowing Jack to perform special attacks to instantly defeat multiple enemies. Monocoins earned from defeating enemies can be used to purchase upgrades for both Komaru's Hacking Gun and Jack's scissors, and various skills can be unlocked and equipped, such as extended health. The game features three difficulty settings, with harder difficulties containing less ammunition and fewer opportunities to use Jack's assistance.\n\nThe game takes place half a year after the events of the first game, prior to the events of the second game. Komaru Naegi, the younger sister of the first game's protagonist, Makoto Naegi, has spent the past year locked inside an apartment complex in Towa City, unaware of the events that have gone on in the outside world. She is suddenly forced to flee when she was attacked by deadly Monokuma robots and comes across Future Foundation member Byakuya Togami, who gives Komaru a special Hacking Gun that can fight against the robot and orders her to escape the city. However, Komaru's escape fails and she is captured by a group of elementary-school children known as the Warriors of Hope, who seek to create a utopia for children by murdering all the adults with their robots. They force Komaru to join their \"Demon Hunting\" game and drop her into the city, where she is saved by Homicidal maniac Genocide Jack, who soon reverts to her true self, Toko Fukawa, a survivor of Hopes Peak High School. Toko can now control Jack through the use of a stun gun. Learning that Byakuya may have been kidnapped by the Warriors of Hope, Toko agrees to team up with Komaru to find Byakuya and escape the city. Along the way they encounter a resistance group, run by Haiji Towa, and meet a white bear robot named Shirokuma.\n\nAs Komaru and Toko go on their journey, fighting against the Warriors of Hope and encountering much despair along the way, they learn that the Warriors of Hope are in worship of Junko Enoshima, the Ultimate Despair responsible for bringing about the end of the world, and seek to create a successor. Confronting the group's leader, Monaca Towa, and defeating their advisor Kurokuma, Komaru is given the choice of destroying the Monokuma Controller, which would stop all the robots but at the cost of sacrificing all the children wearing Monokuma Kid masks. Monaca then reveals that her goal is to turn Komaru into the next Junko Enoshima, trying to coerce her into destroying the controller by allegedly revealing her parents were killed. However, Toko, having learned a great deal from travelling with Komaru, slaps some sense into her and together they overcome despair in order to defeat an out-of-control mech. As Monaca is inevitably rescued by Nagito Komaeda, who encourages her to become the next Junko herself, it is revealed that both Shirokuma and Kurokuma were controlled by the real Junko's AI, who has Izuru Kamukura carry out the next part of her plan. Meanwhile, after rescuing Byakuya, Komaru and Toko decide to stay behind in Towa City to help out those who need it.\n\nHowever, if Komaru chooses to destroy the controller before learning its true purpose, the Bad Ending is triggered and all of the Monokuma Kids are killed as their masks explode. Komaru becomes the hero of the resistance, but she feels extremely guilty for what she has done.\n\nWith the two previous entries in the \"Danganronpa\" series being visual novel adventure games, members of Spike Chunsoft wanted to develop a spin-off game that was more action oriented. One of the proponents for a spin-off game was series writer Kazutaka Kodaka; he had wanted to write a story of two characters running away from despair, and he felt that the easiest way to do this was through an action game that necessitated movement. When Spike Chunsoft green-lit the proposal, they let Kodaka have free rein to write the narrative for \"Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls\". Kodaka stated that he spent an equal amount of time writing the dialogue and backstories for the protagonists as he did for the antagonists. One aspect of \"Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls\" that the development team was worried about was whether the shift in gameplay genres would alienate players who were not good at action games. They decided to add the mechanic of switching between characters, as Genocide Jack would make the game significantly easier.\n\n\"Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls\" was announced at a Sony Computer Entertainment press conference in September 2013, where the first gameplay trailer was shown; the trailer also teased the . It was then released in Japan on September 25, 2014. To promote the game, Spike Chunsoft offered several pre-order bonuses, including digital wallpapers, mousepads, and a smartphone stand. Additional merchandise such as Monokuma stuffed toys and an armband were also offered at Comiket. NIS America localized and published the international versions of the game. It was released in North America on September 1, 2015, in Europe on September 4, and in Australia on September 10. NIS America offered a limited edition of the game, which included a concept art book, the game's soundtrack, and other collector's items. NIS America released the game for PlayStation 4 in North America and Europe in Summer 2017.\n\nThe game has received two manga adaptations. A manga by Machika Minami, titled \"Zettai Zetsubō Shōjo: Danganronpa Another Episode: Genocider Mode\", began serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's \"Dengeki Maoh\" magazine from January 2015. A second manga by Hajime Toya debuted in Kadokawa Shoten's \"Famitsu Comic Clear\" magazine in February 2015, and will be serialized until July 2017. Two comic anthologies by various artists were released on January 24, 2015 and May 25, 2015 respectively.\n\nA \"Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls\" mobile app featuring Komaru was released for Android in Japan in August 2015. The app allows users to manage their smartphone files and cache, and Komaru's expression will change depending on the amount of storage used.\n\n\"Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls\" received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the game received an average score of 72, based on 35 reviews. The game sold 70,596 copies within its debut release week in Japan, and 85,930 copies in two weeks. The Steam release had an estimated total of 32,000 players by July 2018.\n"}

In 2018, \"gado-gado\" is promoted as one of 5 national dishes of Indonesia.\n\nThe term \"gado\" or the verb \"menggado\" means to consume something without rice. \"Gado-gado\" in Indonesian literally means \"mix-mix\" since it is made of rich mixture of vegetables such as potatoes, longbeans, bean sprouts, spinach, chayote, bitter gourd, corn and cabbage, with tofu, tempeh and hard-boiled eggs, all mixed in peanut sauce dressing, sometimes also topped with \"krupuk\" and sprinkles of fried shallots. \"Gado-gado\" is different from \"lotek atah\" or \"karedok\" which uses raw vegetables. Another similar dish is the Javanese \"pecel\".\n\n\"Gado-gado\" is widely sold in almost every part of Indonesia, with each area having its own modifications. It is thought to have originally been a Sundanese dish, as it is most prevalent in Western parts of Java (which includes Jakarta, Banten, and West Java provinces). The Javanese have their own slightly similar version of a vegetables-in-peanut-sauce dish called \"pecel\" which is more prevalent in Central and East Java. \"Gado-gado\" is widely available from hawkers' carts, stalls (\"warung\") and restaurants and hotels in Indonesia; it is also served in Indonesian-style restaurants worldwide. Though it is customarily called a salad, the peanut sauce is a larger component of \"gado-gado\" than is usual for the dressings in Western-style salads; the vegetables should be well coated with it.\n\nSome eating establishments use different mixtures of peanut sauce, such as adding cashew nuts for taste. In Jakarta, some eating establishment boast \"gado-gado\" as their signature dish, some of which have been in business for decades and have developed faithful clientele. Gado-Gado Boplo restaurant chain for example has been around since 1970, while Gado-Gado Bonbin in Cikini has been around since 1960.\n\nThe key to a delicious \"gado-gado\" is the sauce made of fried crushed savory peanuts, sweet palm sugar, garlic, chilies, salt, tamarind and a squeeze of lime. Gado-gado is generally freshly made, sometimes in front of the customers to suit their personal preference for the degree of spiciness, which corresponds to the amount of chili pepper included. However, particularly in the West, \"gado-gado\" sauce is often prepared ahead of time and in bulk. \"Gado-gado\" sauce is also available in dried form, which simply needs to be rehydrated by adding hot water.\n\n\"Gado-gado\" sauce is not to be confused with satay sauce, which is also a peanut sauce.\n\nMost of flavours in gado-gado are acquired from the mixture of its \"bumbu kacang\" or peanut salad dressing. Gado-gado perfectly combines a slightly sweet, spicy and savory tastes. The common primary ingredients of the peanut sauce are as follows:\n\n\nThe traditional method of making \"gado-gado\" is to use the \"cobek\" (pestle) and \"ulekan\" or flat rounded stone. The dry ingredients are ground first, then the tamarind liquids is added to achieve the desired consistency.\n\nThe composition of the vegetable salad varies greatly, but usually comprises a mixture of some of the following:\nOutside Indonesia, it is usual to improvise with whatever vegetables are available.\nAll the ingredients are blanched or lightly boiled, including vegetables, potatoes and bean sprouts, except for the tempeh and tofu, which is fried, and cucumber which is sliced and served fresh. The blanched vegetables and other ingredients are mixed well with the peanut sauce.\n\nIn Indonesia \"gado-gado\" is commonly served mixed with chopped \"lontong\" or \"ketupat\" (glutinous rice cake), or with steamed rice served separately. It is nearly always served with \"krupuk\" (crackers), e.g. tapioca crackers or \"emping\", Indonesian style fried crackers, which are made from \"melinjo\". A common garnish is \"bawang goreng\" a finely-chopped fried shallot sprinkles.\n\n"}
{"id": "3530241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3530241", "title": "Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering", "text": "Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering\n\nThe Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) is an examination that primarily tests the comprehensive understanding of various undergraduate subjects in engineering and science. GATE is conducted jointly by the Indian Institute of Science and seven Indian Institutes of Technologies at Roorkee, Delhi, Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Chennai (Madras) and Mumbai (Bombay) on behalf of the National Coordination Board – GATE, Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), Government of India.\n\nThe GATE score of a candidate reflects the relative performance level of a candidate. The score is used for admissions to various post-graduate education programs (e.g. Master of Engineering, Master of Technology, Doctor of Philosophy) in Indian higher education institutes, with financial assistance provided by MHRD and other government agencies. Recently, GATE scores are also being used by several Indian public sector undertakings (i.e., government-owned companies) for recruiting graduate engineers in entry-level positions. It is one of the most competitive examinations in India. GATE is also recognized by various institutes outside India, such as Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nA valid GATE score is essential for obtaining financial assistance during Master’s programs and direct Doctoral programs in Engineering / Technology / Architecture and Doctoral programs in relevant branches of Science in Institutes supported by the Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD) or other Government agencies. As per the directives of MHRD, the following procedure is to be adopted for admission to the post-graduate programs (Master’s and Doctoral) with MHRD scholarship/assistant-ship: Depending upon the norms adopted by a specific institute or department of the Institute, a candidate may be admitted directly into a course based on his/her performance in GATE only or based on his/her performance in GATE and an admission test / interview conducted by the department to which he/she has applied and/or the candidate’s academic record. If the candidate is to be selected through test/interview for post-graduate programs, the minimum of 70% weight is given to the performance in GATE and the remaining 30% weight can be given to the candidate’s performance in test/interview and/or academic record. The admitting institutes can, however, prescribe a minimum passing percentage of marks in the test/interview. Some colleges/institutes specify GATE qualification as the mandatory requirement even for admission without MHRD scholarship/assistant-ship.\n\nTo avail the financial assistance (scholarship), the candidate must first secure admission to a program in these Institutes, by a procedure that could vary from institute to institute. Qualification in GATE is also a minimum requirement to apply for various fellowships awarded by many Government organizations. The criteria for postgraduate admission with scholarship/assistant-ship could be different for different institutions.\n\nIn December 2014, the University Grants Commission and MHRD announced that the scholarship for GATE-qualified master's degree students is increased by 55%, from per month to per month.\n\nThe following students are eligible to take GATE:\n\n\nThose who have completed section A or equivalent of such professional courses are also eligible.\n\nThere is no age limit criterion defied by the exam conducting authority to appear in GATE.\n\nAt present, GATE is conducted in the following 24 disciplines. A candidate can select any one of these.\nThere is a total of 14 paper sections that come under these two Papers. The paper sections under XE* and XL* are defined by some dedicated codes which are mentioned in the following table- \n\nThe examination is of 3 hours duration, and contains a total of 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onward, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen. The questions consist of both Multiple Choice Questions or MCQs (four answer options out of which the correct one has to be chosen) and Numerical Answer Type questions or NATs (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse).Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.\n\n\nThe examination will consist of totally 65 questions, segregated as One-mark and Two-mark questions. Out of 65 questions, 10 questions will be from General Aptitude (Verbal and Numerical ability) and 55 questions will be Technical, based on the Paper chosen. The General Aptitude section will have 5 One-mark questions and 5 Two-mark questions, accounting for about 15% of total marks. The Technical section and Engineering Mathematics section will combinedly have 25 One-mark questions and 30 Two-mark questions, accounting for about 85% of total marks. Further, all the sections will have both Multiple Choice Questions or MCQs and Numerical Answer Type questions or NATs. The examination awards negative marks for wrong MCQ answers. Usually, 1/3rd of original marks will be deducted for wrong MCQ answers (i.e -0.33 for wrong One-mark answers and -0.66 for wrong Two-mark answers) while there is no negative marks for NATs.\n\nGATE results are usually declared about one month after the examinations are over. The results show the total marks scored by a candidate, the GATE score, the all-India rank (AIR) and the cut off marks for various categories in the candidate's paper. The score is valid for 3 years from the date of announcement of the GATE results. The score cards are issued only to qualified candidates.\n\nCalculation of \"normalized marks\" for subjects held in multiple sessions (CE, CS, EC, EE and ME):\n\nFrom 2014 onward, examination for CE, CS, EC, ME and EE subjects is being held in multiple sessions. Hence, for these subjects, a suitable normalization is applied to take into account any variation in the difficulty levels of the question sets across different sessions. The normalization is done based on the fundamental assumption that \"in all multi-session GATE papers, the distribution of abilities of candidates is the same across all the sessions\". According to the GATE committee, this assumption is justified since \"the number of candidates appearing in multi-session subjects in GATE 2014 is large and the procedure of allocation of session to candidates is random. Further it is also ensured that for the same multi-session subject, the number of candidates allotted in each session is of the same order of magnitude.\"\n\nBased on the above, and considering various normalization methods, the committee arrived at the following formula for calculating the normalized marks, for CE, CS, EC, EE and ME subjects:\n\nNormalized mark () of \"j\" candidate in \"i\" session, is given by <br>\n<br> where,\n\nAfter evaluation of the answers, normalized marks based on the above formula will be calculated using the raw (actual) marks obtained by a candidate in the CE, CS, EC, EE or ME subject. The \"score\" will be calculated using these normalized marks. For all other subjects (whose tests are conducted in a single session), the actual marks obtained by the candidates will be used in calculating the score.\n\nCalculation of GATE Score for all subjects (single-session and multiple-session):\n\nFrom GATE 2014 onward (and year 2014-15 of the 2-year validity period of GATE 2013 score), a candidate's GATE score is computed by the following new formula. <br>\nformula_1 \nwhere,\nPercentile:\n\nA candidate's percentile denotes the percentage of candidates scoring lower than that particular candidate. It is calculated as:\n\n\"Percentile\" = ( 1 - ) x 100%\n\nTill GATE 2012 (and year 2013-14 of the 2-year validity period of GATE 2013 score), the score was calculated using the formula:\n\nGATE score = formula_2\n\nwhere,\n\nThe rules for qualifying marks have varied from year to year. The qualifying marks (out of 100) are different for different subjects as well as categories.\n\nHere μ is the average (i.e., arithmetic mean) of marks of all candidates in the subject (with negative marks converted to zero) and σ is the standard deviation of all marks in that subject.\n\nUsually, the general category's qualifying mark is in the 25 to 50 range.\n\nThe Government of India implemented reservations for other backward classes in college admissions and public sector job recruitment in the year 2008. Before that, all OBC candidates were included in the \"general\" category. There was no separate OBC category then.\n\nThe following line chart shows the number of candidates registered, appeared, and qualified (total of all subjects).\n\nThe following line chart shows the variation of the number of candidates appeared in the 5 subjects with the largest numbers of appeared candidates, since GATE 2010:\n\nGATE, for long, has been known to test the Engineering basics in a smart way. Complaints of \"lengthy\" problems have been rare. But the task of mastering an entire course of Engineering (around 30 undergraduate subjects) for a three-hour test, itself gives the test a certain level of toughness. Each year, only around 15% of all appearing candidates qualify. High percentiles (more than 99th percentile, in some cases) are required to get admission in M.Tech. or M.E. degree programs in Indian Institutes of Technology and Indian Institute of Science, or get shortlisted for job interviews in Indian public sector undertakings.\n\nUnlike undergraduate admissions in India, candidates must apply individually to each institute after the institute has published its M.Tech. notification (usually in the month of March). There is no separate counselling held.\n\nSome institutions specify GATE qualification as mandatory even for admission of self-financing students to postgraduate programs. GATE qualified candidates are also eligible for the award of Junior Research Fellowship in CSIR Laboratories and CSIR sponsored projects. Top rank holders in some GATE papers are entitled to apply for \"Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Fellowship\" awarded by CSIR.\nSome government organizations prescribe GATE qualification as a requirement for applying to the post of a Scientist/Engineer.\n\nIn recent years, various academicians have recognized GATE as being one of the toughest exams in its category. Some non-Indian universities like the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and some technical universities in Germany also identify GATE score as a parameter for judging the quality of the candidates for admission into their Masters and Ph.D. programs.\n\nSome management institutes like NITIE, Mumbai offer admission to Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Engineering on the basis of GATE score.\n\nMost Indian institutes do not specify cut-off marks for previous years. So there is a general confusion in terms of selecting institutes and specializations. But in the recent years IIT Kharagpur and IIT Guwahati have been specifying last year cut-off mark list. Indian Institute of Technology Delhi has a very detailed website on Post Graduate (PG) activities and admissions where students can find the relevant information on cut-off marks etc. Typically the Indian Institute of Science and Indian Institutes of Technology are the most selective followed by National Institutes of Technology and others. Also there are some state universities in India, whose standards and facilities are very much comparable to top IITs and NITs. Some of them are PEC University of Technology (Chandigarh), Bengal Engineering and Science University (recently converted to IIEST), Jadavpur University, Delhi Technological University, gautam budh technical university, u.p, Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT), Andhra University College of Engineering, Osmania University etc. Even within the top institutes, the selection criteria varies widely across departments and programs depending on expertise areas. The Directorate of Technical Education of Maharashtra state has also started conducting CAP round from the year 2013 for GATE and non-GATE candidates in all institutes in Maharashtra that offer M.E./M.Tech. programs.\n\nThe Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) introduced the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) - GATE scheme in 2002 to allow GATE-qualified engineering graduates and GPAT-qualified pharmaceutical graduates to pursue research through suitable Ph.D. programs at CSIR laboratories.\n\nStipend and tenure:\n\nThe fellowship amount is per month plus HRA (house rent allowance). In addition, contingency grant of per annum (calculated on pro-rata basis for fraction of a year) is also provided. On completion of 2 years as JRF - GATE, the fellowship may be upgraded to SRF (Senior Research Fellowship) - GATE and stipend may be increased to per month in the subsequent years, on the basis of assessment of CSIR JRF-NET guidelines.\n\nThe total duration of the fellowship is 5 years, within which the candidate is expected to complete the Ph.D. degree.\n\nPublic sector undertakings (PSUs) in India, for long, have had troubles conducting their recruitment processes with more than 100,000 students taking the exams for less than 1000 jobs (a selection rate of less than 1%). After sensing the exponential rise in the number of engineering graduates in India who wish to get a PSU job, the PSUs have decided that a GATE score shall be the primary criteria for initial shortlisting. This change was the primary cause for the rapid increase in applicants for GATE 2012.\n\nIndian Oil Corporation was the first PSU which successfully tested out this system and was followed two years later by National Thermal Power Corporation, Bharat Heavy Electricals, Bharat Electronics & PowerGrid Corporation of India.\n\nUsually these companies release their recruitment notifications right after GATE notification, indicating that candidates have to take GATE to be considered for a job in their organizations.\n\nMany companies have signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with the GATE organizing committee, for using GATE score as a screening tool for recruiting engineers at entry level positions.\n\nThe syllabus for the GATE exam and its preparation remains the same, irrespective of whether one is applying for a job at a PSU or seeking admission for post graduation in engineering.\n\nEach year's GATE is organised by any one of 8 institutes: IISc and 7 IITs. The overall co-ordination and responsibility of conducting GATE lies with this institute, which is designated as the Organizing Institute (OI) for GATE of that year. GATE coaching institutes often make speculations regarding the topics to focus upon depending upon the institute that is the OI of that year.\n\n\n\n"}

Depending on culture or historical period, a handmaiden may be of slave status or may be simply an employee. However, the term \"handmaiden\" explicitly implies lowly status.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the term handmaid is applied to a female servant who serves her mistress, as in the case of Hagar being described as Sarai's handmaid, Zilpah being Leah's handmaid and Bilhah as Rachel's handmaid. In each of these cases, the mistress \"gave\" their handmaid to their husbands \"to wife\", to bear his \"seed\" (children). The use in the Torah of the prefix \"to\", as in \"gave to wife\", may indicate that the wife is a concubine or inferior wife. The text repeats that these people remain handmaids of their mistress though they are also the concubine of the mistress's husband. They are referred to interchangeably by the Hebrew terms (\"’āmāh\") and (\"šip̄ḥāh\").\n\nIn Christianity, Mary, the mother of Jesus is referred to as the \"handmaid of the Lord\" or \"servant of the Lord\", both of which are titles of honour for the mother of Jesus. The Gospel of Luke describes Mary as the \"handmaid of the Lord\" (Greek δούλη, \"doulē\") when she gives her consent to the message of the Angel (cf. ), and when she proclaims the greatness of the Lord because of \"the great things\" he has worked in her (cf. ).\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13785959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13785959", "title": "Hiri trade cycle", "text": "Hiri trade cycle\n\nHiri is the name for the traditional trade voyages that formed an important part of the culture of the Motu people of Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe Motu live in a comparative rain shadow – the dry season is unusually harsh, and there are not enough suitable areas for the growing of sago (\"rabia\"). On the other hand, the Motu, unlike most people of Papua New Guinea, were skilled in the art of making clay cooking pots (\"uro\").\n\nThe traditional Hiri voyages carried the much-prized Motu cooking pots to the people of the Gulf of Papua, and brought back plentiful supplies of sago for the Motu.\n\nEdai Siabo, from the village of Boera, was returning from a fishing trip when a great eel appeared and dragged him under the water. The eel was really the spirit of the sea. He returned Edai to the surface of the sea, after instructing him to build a great lagatoi (sailing canoe), to fill it with cooking pots, and to sail westward, following the south-east trade wind called the \"laurabada\" in the Motu language. Obeying the spirit, he built the first hiri lagatoi, named it \"Bogebada\" (which means sea-eagle), and had it loaded with pots made by his wife. He and his friends then sailed up the coast into the waters of the Gulf of Papua.\n\nFor months, the Bogebada and its crew were away. The villagers were all convinced the crew had perished. They mocked Edai’s wife, and tried to force her to remarry. Before Edai left, he had instructed her to stay within a corner of her house, not to bathe in the sea, to keep a tally of the days the Bogebada had been gone, to keep her fire burning, and to have her skin tattooed by an old woman. Failing to stick to this routine would endanger the expedition and the lives of Edai and his men.\n\nOne day, a lagatoi appeared on the horizon and slowly approached the village. It was Bogebada. Edai was arriving back home, a hero. His wife jumped into the sea and washed away her accumulated dirt, put on her finest costume, walked out onto the verandah of the house, hit it with a stick, shouted, ‘Hedihoroha Bogebada!’ and began dancing in joy.\n\nEvery year Motu men prepared lagatois (large, multi-hulled sailing canoes) for the hiri, while the women shaped and fired the uro (pots). When the laurabada (south-east trade winds) started to blow, the canoes set off to the west.\n\nThe outward voyage was usually comparatively short and uneventful, typically only a week or so. The destination was almost always a village in the Gulf where the crew of the lagatoi were known from previous voyages, and the trade itself was quickly made. A simplified form of the Motu language (nowadays called Hiri Motu) was used for communication between the traders. The voyagers could not return immediately, however. For a start they had to wait for the change of the season, and the onset of the lahara, the monsoon wind from the north-west that would carry them home. Secondly, their canoes had to be enlarged and re-built to carry the much more bulky cargo of sago.\n\nAfter two or three months, the homeward voyage began. This was far more dangerous than the outgoing voyage, as the lahara season produces heavy seas and the risk of severe storms. The lagatoi themselves were burdened by a far heavier cargo, not to mention extra hulls, that enabled more sago to be carried, but did little for the seaworthiness or handiness of the canoes. It was an anxious time for the wives of the lagatoi crews as they faithfully followed the ritual started by Edai’s wife to ensure a safe return.\n\nWhen the lagatoi canoes did return safely, it was a time for great rejoicing (moale).\n\nThe Hiri voyages continued, interrupted only by the Second World War, until the late fifties, when a heavily laden and storm-damaged lagatoi foundered off Boera village on its return voyage with heavy loss of life. Further voyages were forbidden by the colonial authorities.\n\nWith independence, and the need of Papua New Guineans to preserve and celebrate their culture, the Hiri Moale Festival was started. The festival coincides with the national independence day celebrations, and features traditional dances, the Hiri Queen contest (a beauty pageant), the arrival of the lagatoi, canoe racing, musical presentations, and an arts and crafts exhibition.\n\nIn recent years, there has been some controversy about Hiri Moale being held in Port Moresby, rather than at nearby Boera, traditionally regarded as the birthplace of Edai Siabo.\n\n\nhow people benefited from clay pots"}
{"id": "14608373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14608373", "title": "History of the Welsh language", "text": "History of the Welsh language\n\nThe history of the Welsh language spans over 1400 years, encompassing the stages of the language known as Primitive Welsh, Old Welsh, Middle Welsh, and Modern Welsh.\n\nWelsh evolved from British, the Celtic language spoken by the ancient Britons. Alternatively classified as Insular Celtic or P-Celtic, it probably arrived in Britain during the Bronze Age or Iron Age and was probably spoken throughout the island south of the Firth of Forth. During the Early Middle Ages the British language began to fragment due to increased dialect differentiation, evolving into Welsh and the other Brythonic languages (Breton, Cornish, and the extinct Cumbric). It is not clear when Welsh became distinct.\n\nKenneth H. Jackson suggested that the evolution in syllabic structure and sound pattern was complete by around 550, and labeled the period between then and about 800 \"Primitive Welsh\". This Primitive Welsh may have been spoken in both Wales and the Hen Ogledd (\"Old North\"), the Brythonic-speaking areas of what is now northern England and southern Scotland, and therefore been the ancestor of Cumbric as well as Welsh. Jackson, however, believed that the two varieties were already distinct by that time. The earliest Welsh poetry – that attributed to the \"Cynfeirdd\" or \"Early Poets\" – is generally considered to date to the Primitive Welsh period. However, much of this poetry was supposedly composed in the Hen Ogledd, raising further questions about the dating of the material and language in which it was originally composed.\n\nThe next main period, somewhat better attested, is Old Welsh (, 9th to 11th centuries); poetry from both Wales and Scotland has been preserved in this form of the language. As Germanic and Gaelic colonisation of Great Britain proceeded, the Brythonic speakers in Wales were split off from those in northern England, speaking Cumbric, and those in the south-west, speaking what would become Cornish, and so the languages diverged. The Book of Aneirin (\"Canu Aneirin\", c. AD 600) and the Poetry, or Book, of Taliesin (\"Canu Taliesin\") belong to this era, though both also include some poems originally written in Primitive Welsh.\n\nMiddle Welsh () is the label attached to the Welsh of the 12th to 14th centuries, of which much more remains than for any earlier period. This is the language of nearly all surviving early manuscripts of the \"Mabinogion\", although the tales themselves are certainly much older. It is also the language of the existing Welsh law manuscripts. Middle Welsh is reasonably intelligible, albeit with some work, to a modern-day Welsh speaker.\n\nThe famous cleric Gerald of Wales tells a story of King Henry II of England. During one of the King's many raids in the 12th century, Henry asked an old man of Pencader, Carmarthenshire, whether he thought the Welsh language had any chance:\n\nModern Welsh can be divided into two periods. The first, \"Early Modern Welsh\" ran from the early 15th century to roughly the end of the 16th century.\n\n\"Late Modern Welsh\" began with the publication of William Morgan's translation of the Bible in 1588. Like its English counterpart, the King James Version, this proved to have a strong stabilizing effect on the language, and indeed the language today still bears the same \"Late Modern\" label as Morgan's language. Of course, many changes have occurred since then.\n\nThe 19th century was a critical period in the history of the Welsh language and one that encompassed many contradictions. In 1800 Welsh was the main spoken language of the vast majority of Wales, with the only exceptions being some border areas and other places which had seen significant settlement, such as south Pembrokeshire; by the 1901 census this proportion had declined to a little over half of the population, though the large increase in the total population over the century (due to the effects of industrialisation and in-migration) meant that the total number of Welsh speakers grew throughout the 19th century, peaking in the 1911 census at over one million even as the proportion of the Welsh population that could speak Welsh fell below 50% for the first time.\n\nEspecially when compared to other stateless languages in Europe, the language boasted an extraordinarily active press, with poetry, religious writing, biography, translations, and, by the end of the century, novels all appearing in the language, as well as countless newspapers, journals and periodicals. An ongoing interest in antiquarianism ensured the dissemination of the language's medieval poetry and prose (such as the Mabinogion). A further development was the publication of some of the first complete and concise Welsh dictionaries. Early work by Welsh lexicographic pioneers such as Daniel Silvan Evans ensured that the language was documented as accurately as possible. Modern dictionaries such as the (the University of Wales Dictionary), are direct descendants of these dictionaries.\n\nDespite these outward signs of health, it was during the nineteenth century that English replaced Welsh as the most widely spoken language within the country. Wales, particularly the South Wales Coalfield, experienced significant population growth and in-migration (primarily from England and Ireland) which changed the linguistic profile of some areas (though other areas would remain Welsh-speaking despite the changes). \n\nWelsh held no official recognition and had limited status under the British state. Learning English was enthusiastically encouraged, in contrast, Welsh was not taught or used as a medium of instruction in schools, many of which actively discouraged the use of Welsh using measures such as the Welsh Not. Welsh was increasingly restricted in scope to the non-conformist religious chapels, who would teach children to read and write in Sunday schools. Individuals such as Matthew Arnold championed the virtues of Welsh literature whilst simultaneously advocating the replacement of Welsh as the everyday language of the country with English, and many Welsh-speakers themselves such as David Davies and John Ceiriog Hughes advocated bilingualism, if not necessarily the extinction of Welsh.\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century English came to prevail in the large cities of South East Wales. Welsh remained strong in the north west and in parts of mid Wales and south-west Wales. Rural Wales was a stronghold of the Welsh language - and so also were the industrial slate-quarrying communities of Caernarvonshire and Merionethshire. Many of the non-conformist churches throughout Wales were strongly associated with the Welsh language.\n\nBy the 20th century, the numbers of Welsh speakers were shrinking at a rate which suggested that the language would be extinct within a few generations.\n\nAccording to the 1911 census, out of a population of just under 2.5 million, 43.5% of those aged three years and upwards in Wales and Monmouthshire spoke Welsh (8.5% monoglot Welsh speakers, 35% bilingual in English and Welsh). This was a decrease from the 1891 census with 49.9% speaking Welsh out of a population of 1.5 million (15.1% monoglot, 34.8% bilingual). The distribution of those speaking the language however was unevenly distributed with five counties remaining overwhelmingly and predominantly Welsh speaking: \nOutside these five counties, a further two areas were noted as having a majority who spoke Welsh, those being:\n\nThe 1921 census recorded that of the population of Wales (including Monmouthshire,) 38.7% of the population could speak Welsh while 6.6% of the overall population were Welsh monoglots. In the five predominantly Welsh speaking counties, Welsh was spoken by more than 75% of the population, and was more widely understood than English: \n\nDenbighshire was the only other county where a majority could still speak Welsh, here, 51.0% could speak Welsh and 94.0% could speak English. As for larger urban areas, Aberdare was the only one where a majority could still speak Welsh, here 59.0% could speak Welsh while 95.4% could speak English. In Cardiff, Wales' capital, 5.2% of people could speak Welsh, while 99.7% of people could speak English. \nAt a district level, Llanfyrnach rural district in Pembrokeshire had the highest percentage of Welsh speakers; at 97.5%, while Penllyn rural district in Merioneth had the highest percentage of Welsh monoglots; at 57.3%. Bethesda urban district in Carnarvonshire was the most Welsh speaking urban district in Wales; 96.6% of the district's population could speak Welsh.\n\nPlaid Cymru, The Party of Wales was founded at a 1925 National Eisteddfod meeting, held in Pwllheli, Gwynedd with the primary aim of promoting the Welsh language.\n\nConcern for the Welsh language was ignited in 1936 when the UK government decided to build an RAF training camp and aerodrome at Penyberth on the Llŷn Peninsula in Gwynedd. The events surrounding the protest became known as \"Tân yn Llŷn\" (Fire in Llŷn). The UK government had settled on Llŷn as the location for this military site after plans for similar bases in Northumberland and Dorset had met with protests.\n\nHowever, UK Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin refused to hear the case against basing this RAF establishment in Wales, despite a deputation claiming to represent half a million Welsh protesters. The opposition against 'British' military usage of this site in Wales was summed up by Saunders Lewis when he wrote that the UK government was intent upon turning one of the 'essential homes of Welsh culture, idiom, and literature' into a place for promoting a barbaric method of warfare.\n\nOn 8 September 1936 the building was arsoned, and Welsh nationalists Saunders Lewis, Lewis Valentine and D.J. Williams claimed responsibility. The case was tried at Caernarfon, where the jury failed to reach a verdict. It was then sent to the Old Bailey in London, where the \"Three\" were convicted and sentenced to nine months imprisonment. On their release from Wormwood Scrubs they were greeted as heroes by a crowd of 15,000 people at a pavilion in Caernarfon.\n\nWith the advent of broadcasting in Wales, Plaid Cymru protested against the lack of Welsh-language programmes in Wales and launched a campaign to withhold licence fees. Pressure was successful, and by the mid-1930s more Welsh-language programming was broadcast, with the formal establishment of a Welsh regional broadcasting channel by 1937. However, no dedicated Welsh-language television channel would be established until 1982.\n\nAccording to the 1931 census, out of a population of just over 2.5 million, the percentage of Welsh speakers in Wales had dropped to 36.8%, with Anglesey recording the highest concentration of speakers at 87.4%, followed by Cardigan at 87.1%, Merionethshire at 86.1%, and Carmarthen at 82.3%. Caernarfon listed 79.2%. Radnorshire and Monmouthshire ranked lowest with a concentration of Welsh speakers less than 6% of the population.\n\nFollowing the arrests of D.J Williams, Saunders Lewis and Lewis Valantine for the \"tân yn llŷn\" in 1936 all three were tried on charges of arson in Caernarfon crown court where their pleads were deemed invalid as they all pleaded in Welsh. Following the jury's indecision on the matter it was decided that the case should be moved to the Old Bailey causing outrage though Wales which along with the lack of status for the Welsh language in the legal system sparked action. At Cardiff Eisteddfod in 1939 a petition was launched by Undeb Cymdeithasau Cymru (The union of Welsh societies) calling for recognition of the Welsh language in the courts. Their presentation of the petition to parliament in 1941 lead to the passing of the Welsh courts act of 1942 and thus the validation of pleas in the Welsh language.\n\nIn 1956, a private bill sponsored by Liverpool City Council was brought before the UK parliament to develop a water reservoir from the Tryweryn Valley, in Meirionnydd in Gwynedd. The development would include the flooding of Capel Celyn (Holly Chapel), a Welsh-speaking community of historic significance. Despite universal and bi-partisan objections by Welsh politicians (35 out of 36 Welsh MPs opposed the bill, and one abstained) the bill was passed in 1957. The events surrounding the flooding highlighted the status of the language in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn 1962 Saunders Lewis gave a radio speech entitled (The Fate of the Language) in which he predicted the extinction of the Welsh language unless direct action was taken. Lewis was responding to the 1961 census, which showed a decrease in the number of Welsh speakers from 36% in 1931 to 26% in 1961, out of a population of about 2.5 million. Meirionnydd, Anglesey, Carmarthen, and Caernarfon averaged a 75% concentration of Welsh speakers, but the most significant decrease was in the counties of Glamorgan, Flint, and Pembroke.\n\nLewis' intent was to motivate Plaid Cymru to take more direct action to promote the language; however it led to the formation of \"Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg\" (the Welsh Language Society) later that year at a Plaid Cymru summer school held in Pontardawe in Glamorgan.\n\nWith concern for the Welsh language mounting in the 1960s, the Welsh Language Act 1967 was passed, giving some legal protection for the use of Welsh in official government business. The Act was based on the Hughes Parry report, published in 1965, which advocated equal validity for Welsh in speech and in written documents, both in the courts and in public administration in Wales. However the Act did not include all the Hughes Parry report's recommendations. Prior to the Act, only the English language could be spoken at government and court proceedings.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Welsh Assembly \"Yes Campaign\" in 1979, and believing Welsh nationalism was \"in a paralysis of helplessness\", the UK Conservative Home Secretary announced in September 1979 that the government would \"not\" honour its pledge to establish a Welsh-language television channel, much to widespread anger and resentment in Wales, wrote Dr. Davies.\n\nIn early 1980 over two thousand members of Plaid Cymru pledged to go to prison rather than pay the television licence fees, and by that spring Gwynfor Evans announced his intention to go on hunger strike if a Welsh-language television channel was not established. In early September 1980, Evans addressed thousands at a gathering in which \"passions ran high\", according to Dr. Davies. The government yielded by 17 September, and the Welsh Fourth Channel (S4C) was launched on 2 November 1982.\n\nThe Welsh Language Act 1993 put the Welsh language on an equal footing with the English language in Wales with regard to the public sector.\n\nThe Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 had made English the only language of the law courts and other aspects of public administration in Wales. Although the Welsh Language Act 1967 had given some rights to use Welsh in court, the Welsh Language Act 1993 was the first to put Welsh on an equal basis with English in public life.\n\nThe Act set up the Welsh Language Board, answerable to the Secretary of State for Wales, with the duty to promote the use of Welsh and to ensure compliance with the other provisions. Additionally, the Act gave Welsh speakers the right to speak Welsh in court proceedings under all circumstances. The previous Act had only given limited protection to the use of Welsh in court proceedings. The Act obliges all organisations in the public sector providing services to the public in Wales to treat Welsh and English on an equal basis; however it does not compel private businesses to provide services in Welsh: that would require a further Language Act.\n\nSome of the powers given to the Secretary of State for Wales under this Act were later devolved to the National Assembly for Wales (), but others have been retained by Westminster.\n\nIn a speech at the 2000 National Eisteddfod at Llanelli, Cynog Dafis, \"Plaid Cymru\" AM, called for a new Welsh-language movement with greater powers to lobby for the Welsh language at the Assembly, UK, and EU levels. Dafis felt the needs of the language were ignored during the first year of the Assembly, and that in order to ensure the dynamic growth of the Welsh language a properly resourced strategy was needed. In his speech Dafis encouraged other Welsh-language advocacy groups to work more closely together to create a more favourable climate in which the use of Welsh was \"attractive, exciting, a source of pride and a sign of strength\". Additionally, Dafis pointed towards efforts in areas such as Catalonia and the Basque country as successful examples to emulate.\n\nLord Elis-Thomas, former \"Plaid Cymru\" president, disagreed with Dafis' assessment, however. At the Urdd Eisteddfod, Lord Elis-Thomas said that there was no need for another Welsh language act, citing that there was \"enough goodwill to safeguard the language's future\". His comments prompted \"Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg\" and many others to call for his resignation as the Assembly's presiding officer.\n\nIn the 1991 census, the Welsh language stabilised at the 1981 level of 18.7%.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census the number of Welsh speakers in Wales increased for the first time in over 100 years, with 20.8% in a population of over 2.9 million claiming fluency in Welsh. Further, 28% of the population of Wales claimed to understand Welsh. The census revealed that the increase was most significant in urban areas, such as Cardiff with an increase from 6.6% in 1991 to 10.9% in 2001, and Rhondda Cynon Taf with an increase from 9% in 1991 to 12.3% in 2001. However, the number of Welsh speakers declined in Gwynedd from 72.1% in 1991 to 68.7%, and in Ceredigion from 59.1% in 1991 to 51.8%. Ceredigion in particular experienced the greatest fluctuation with a 19.5% influx of new residents since 1991.\n\nThe decline in Welsh speakers in Gwynedd and Ynys Môn may be attributable to non-Welsh-speaking people moving to North Wales, driving up property prices to levels that local Welsh speakers cannot afford, according to former Gwynedd county councillor Seimon Glyn of Plaid Cymru.\n\nGlyn was commenting on a report underscoring the dilemma of rocketing house prices outstripping what locals could pay, with the report warning that \"...traditional Welsh communities could die out...\" as a consequence.\n\nMuch of the rural Welsh property market was driven by buyers looking for second homes for use as holiday homes, or for retirement. Many buyers were drawn to Wales from England because of relatively inexpensive house prices in Wales as compared to house prices in England. The rise in home prices outpaced the average earned income in Wales, and meant that many local people could not afford to purchase their first home or compete with second-home buyers.\n\nIn 2001 nearly a third of all properties sold in Gwynedd were bought by buyers from out of the county, and some communities reported as many as a third of local homes used as holiday homes. Holiday home owners spend less than six months of the year in the local community.\n\nThe issue of locals being priced out of the local housing market is common to many rural communities throughout Britain, but in Wales the added dimension of language further complicates the issue, as many new residents do not learn the Welsh language.\n\nConcern for the Welsh language under these pressures prompted Glyn to say \"Once you have more than 50% of anybody living in a community that speaks a foreign language, then you lose your indigenous tongue almost immediately\".\n\n\"Plaid Cymru\" had long advocated controls on second homes, and a 2001 task force headed by Dafydd Wigley recommended land should be allocated for affordable local housing, called for grants for locals to buy houses, and recommended that council tax on holiday homes should double, following similar measures in the Scottish Highlands.\n\nHowever the Welsh Labour-Liberal Democrat Assembly coalition rebuffed these proposals, with Assembly housing spokesman Peter Black stating that \"we [cannot] frame our planning laws around the Welsh language\", adding \"Nor can we take punitive measures against second home owners in the way that they propose as these will have an impact on the value of the homes of local people\".\n\nIn contrast, by autumn 2001 the Exmoor National Park authority in England began to consider limiting second home ownership there, which was also driving up local housing prices by as much as 31%. Elfyn Llwyd, \"Plaid Cymru's\" Parliamentary Group Leader, said that the issues in Exmoor National Park were the same as in Wales, however in Wales there is the added dimension of language and culture.\n\nReflecting on the controversy Glyn's comments caused earlier in the year, Llwyd observed \"What is interesting is of course it is fine for Exmoor to defend their community but in Wales when you try to say these things it is called racist...\"\n\nLlwyd called on other parties to join in a debate to bring the Exmoor experience to Wales when he said \"... I really do ask them and I plead with them to come around the table and talk about the Exmoor suggestion and see if we can now bring it into Wales\".\n\nBy spring 2002 both the Snowdonia National Park (Welsh: \"Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri\") and Pembrokeshire Coast National Park (Welsh: \"Parc Cenedlaethol Arfordir Penfro\") authorities began limiting second home ownership within the parks, following the example set by Exmoor. According to planners in Snowdonia and Pembroke applicants for new homes must demonstrate a proven local need or that the applicant had strong links with the area.\n\nIt seems that the rise of Welsh nationalism rallied supporters of the language, and the establishment of Welsh television and radio found a mass audience which was encouraged in the retention of its Welsh. Perhaps most important of all, at the end of the 20th century it became compulsory for all schoolchildren to learn Welsh up to age 16, and this both reinforced the language in Welsh-speaking areas and reintroduced at least an elementary knowledge of it in areas whlich had become more or less wholly Anglophone. The decline in the percentage of people in Wales who can speak Welsh has now been halted, and there are even signs of a modest recovery. However, although Welsh is the daily language in many parts of Wales, English is universally understood. Further, overall figures may be misleading and it might be argued that the density of welsh speakers (which, if high, leads to a thriving welsh culture) is an equally important statistic. Put another way, were 50,000 additional welsh speakers to be concentrated in areas where welsh is spoken by at least 50% of the population, this would be much more important to the sustainability of the welsh language than the same number dispersed in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea cities.\n\nIn the 2011 census it was recorded that the proportion of people able to speak Welsh had dropped from 20.8% to 19%. Despite an increase in the overall size of the Welsh population this still meant that the number of Welsh speakers in Wales dropped from 582,000 in 2001 to 562,000 in 2011. However this figure was still much higher than 508,000 or 18.7% of people who said they could speak Welsh in the 1991 census.\n\n"}

It was a short-lived small genre that didn't gain popularity in its original form. However, it came back to the public during the turn of the century, and fandom began increasing throughout Europe after undergoing significant changes in Germany in early 2003.\n\nAfter acquiring its current name, jumpstyle was reintroduced in Europe and in 2005 saw artists and groups producing and releasing its music.\n\nThe first key stage of its popularity came between 2007 and 2008 due to the success of music videos such as Scooter's \"The Question Is What Is The Question?\" and \"Jumping All Over the World\", which led to their 13th studio album reaching #1 in the UK charts. However, there are still some radio stations left, broadcasting Jump in its traditional form. The oldest jumpstyle radio was founded in 2005 and still exists today under the name of JumpStation.FM.\n\nThe style has also been fused with other genres, for example, Major Lazer and The Partysquad mixed a unique track with a jungle vocal sample in the track \"Original Don\", with jumpstyle/hardstyle influences. Also, Joel Fletcher's remix of Savage's 2005 single \"Swing\" uses jumpstyle influences.\n\nThere are various jumpstyle leagues across the world; mostly in the form of online video submissions and internet competitions. However, in Belgium there have been staged tournaments such as the European Jump Masters.\n\nThe UK was the first to officially establish online leagues to an international level, with the FIJL (First International Jumpstyle League), but unfortunately support was lacking, and many competitors pulled out, leaving much confusion.\n\nOn the upside, this sparked several International Leagues in countries such as Australia, Russia, Germany and Spain.\n\nJumpstyle music is an offspring of tech-trance, hardstyle, gabber and mákina. Its tempo is usually between 140 and 150 BPM. However, it cannot be seen as merely a slowed down version of gabber. It is characterised by a 909 kick drum used in a four on the floor beat. It also has influences from hard house and electro house. Starting around 2002–03, Jumpstyle music begins to gain influence from hardstyle sound, such as pitched basslines set at a melody, more complex, multiband distortion, and synthesizers utilising square waveforms.\n"}
{"id": "245693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245693", "title": "Kilroy was here", "text": "Kilroy was here\n\nKilroy was here is an American expression that became popular during World War II, typically seen in graffiti. Its origin is debated, but the phrase and the distinctive accompanying doodle became associated with GIs in the 1940s: a bald-headed man (sometimes depicted as having a few hairs) with a prominent nose peeking over a wall with his fingers clutching the wall.\n\n\"Kilroy\" was the American equivalent of the Australian Foo was here which originated during World War I. \"Mr Chad\" or just \"Chad\" was the version that became popular in the United Kingdom. The character of Chad may have been derived from a British cartoonist in 1938, possibly pre-dating \"Kilroy was here\". According to Dave Wilton, \"Some time during the war, Chad and Kilroy met, and in the spirit of Allied unity merged, with the British drawing appearing over the American phrase.\" Other names for the character include Smoe, Clem, Flywheel, Private Snoops, Overby, The Jeep, and Sapo.\n\nAccording to Charles Panati, \"The outrageousness of the graffiti was not so much what it said, but where it turned up.\" It is not known if there was an actual person named Kilroy who inspired the graffiti, although there have been claims over the years.\n\nThe phrase may have originated through United States servicemen who would draw the doodle and the text \"Kilroy was here\" on the walls and other places where they were stationed, encamped, or visited. An ad in \"Life\" magazine noted that WWII-era servicemen were fond of claiming that \"whatever beach-head they stormed, they always found notices chalked up ahead of them, that 'Kilroy was here'\". \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" notes that it was particularly associated with the Air Transport Command, at least when observed in the United Kingdom. At some point, the graffiti (Chad) and slogan (Kilroy was here) must have merged.\n\nMany sources claim origin as early as 1939. An early example of the phrase may date from 1937, before World War II. The US History Channel broadcast \"Fort Knox: Secrets Revealed\" in 2007 included a shot of a chalked \"KILROY WAS HERE\" dated 1937-05-13. Fort Knox's vault was loaded in 1937 and inaccessible until the 1970s, when an audit was carried out and the footage was shot. However, historian Paul Urbahns was involved in the production of the program, and he says that the footage was a reconstruction.\n\nAccording to one story, German intelligence found the phrase on captured American equipment. This led Adolf Hitler to believe that Kilroy could be the name or codename of a high-level Allied spy. At the time of the Potsdam Conference in 1945, it was rumored that Stalin found \"Kilroy was here\" written in the VIP bathroom, prompting him to ask his aides who Kilroy was. War photographer Robert Capa noted a use of the phrase at Bastogne in December 1944: \"On the black, charred walls of an abandoned barn, scrawled in white chalk, was the legend of McAuliffe's GIs: KILROY WAS STUCK HERE.\"\n\nThe phrase \"Foo was here\" was used from 1941–45 as the Australian equivalent of \"Kilroy was here\". \"Foo\" was thought of as a gremlin by the Royal Australian Air Force, and the name may have been derived from the 1930s cartoon \"Smokey Stover\" in which the character used the word \"foo\" when he could not remember the name of something. It has been claimed that Foo came from the acronym for Forward Observation Officer, but this is unlikely.\n\n\"The Oxford English Dictionary\" says simply that Kilroy was \"the name of a mythical person\". One theory identifies James J. Kilroy (1902–1962) as the man behind the signature, an American shipyard inspector. \"The New York Times\" indicated J.J. Kilroy as the origin in 1946, based on the results of a contest conducted by the American Transit Association to establish the origin of the phenomenon. The article noted that Kilroy had marked the ships as they were being built as a way to be sure that he had inspected a compartment, and the phrase would be found chalked in places that nobody could have reached for graffiti, such as inside sealed hull spaces. \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" notes this as a possible origin, but suggests that \"the phrase grew by accident.\"\n\nThe \"Lowell Sun\" reported in November 1945 that Sgt. Francis J. Kilroy, Jr. from Everett, Massachusetts wrote \"Kilroy will be here next week\" on a barracks bulletin board at a Boca Raton, Florida airbase while ill with flu, and the phrase was picked up by other airmen and quickly spread abroad. The Associated Press similarly reported Sgt. Kilroy's account of being hospitalized early in World War II, and his friend Sgt. James Maloney wrote the phrase on a bulletin board. Maloney continued to write the shortened phrase when he was shipped out a month later, according to the AP account, and other airmen soon picked it up. Francis Kilroy only wrote the phrase a couple of times.\n\nThe figure was initially known in the United Kingdom as \"Mr Chad\" and would appear with the slogan \"Wot, no sugar\" or a similar phrase bemoaning shortages and rationing. He often appeared with a single curling hair that resembled a question mark and with crosses in his eyes. The phrase \"Wot, no —?\" pre-dates \"Chad\" and was widely used separately from the doodle. Chad was used by the RAF and civilians; he was known in the Army as Private Snoops, and in the Navy he was called The Watcher. Chad might have first been drawn by British cartoonist George Edward Chatterton in 1938. Chatterton was nicknamed \"Chat\", which may then have become \"Chad.\" \"Life Magazine\" wrote in 1946 that the RAF and Army were competing to claim him as their own invention, but they agreed that he had first appeared around 1944. The character resembles Alice the Goon, a character in Popeye who first appeared in 1933,; and another name for Chad was \"The Goon\".\n\nA spokesman for the Royal Air Force Museum London suggested in 1977 that Chad was probably an adaptation of the Greek letter Omega, used as the symbol for electrical resistance; his creator was probably an electrician in a ground crew. \"Life\" suggested that Chad originated with REME, and noted that a symbol for alternating current resembles Chad (a sine wave through a straight line), that the plus and minus signs in his eyes represent polarity, and that his fingers are symbols of electrical resistors. The character is usually drawn in Australia with pluses and minuses as eyes and the nose and eyes resemble a distorted sine wave. \"The Guardian\" suggested in 2000 that \"Mr. Chad\" was based on a diagram representing an electrical circuit. One correspondent said that a man named Dickie Lyle was at RAF Yatesbury in 1941, and he drew a version of the diagram as a face when the instructor had left the room and wrote \"Wot, no leave?\" beneath it. This idea was repeated in a submission to the BBC in 2005 which included a story of a 1941 radar lecturer in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire who drew the circuit diagram with the words \"WOT! No electrons?\" The RAF Cranwell Apprentices Association says that the image came from a diagram of how to approximate a square wave using sine waves, also at RAF Yatesbury and with an instructor named Chadwick. This version was initially called Domie or Doomie, and \"Life\" noted that Doomie was used by the RAF. REME claimed that the name came from their training school, nicknamed \"Chad's Temple\"; the RAF claimed that it arose from Chadwick House at a Lancashire radio school; and the Desert Rats claimed that it came from an officer in El Alamein.\n\nIt is unclear how Chad gained widespread popularity or became conflated with Kilroy. It was, however, widely in use by the late part of the war and in the immediate post-war years, with slogans ranging from the simple \"What, no bread?\" or \"Wot, no char?\" to the plaintive; one sighting was on the side of a British 1st Airborne Division glider in Operation Market Garden with the complaint \"Wot, no engines?\" The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported in 1946 that Chad was \"the No. 1 doodle\", noting his appearance on a wall in the Houses of Parliament after the 1945 Labour election victory, with \"Wot, no Tories?\" Trains in Austria in 1946 featured Mr. Chad along with the phrase \"Wot—no Fuehrer?\"\n\nAs rationing became less common, so did the joke. The cartoon is occasionally sighted today as \"Kilroy was here\", but \"Chad\" and his complaints have long fallen from popular use, although they continue to be seen occasionally on walls and in references in popular culture.\n\nWriting about the Kilroy phenomenon in 1946, \" The Milwaukee Journal\" describes the doodle as the European counterpart to \"Kilroy was here\", under the name Smoe. It also says that Smoe was called Clem in the African theater. It noted that next to \"Kilroy was here\" was often added \"And so was Smoe\". While Kilroy enjoyed a resurgence of interest after the war due to radio shows and comic writers, the name Smoe had already disappeared by the end of 1946. A B-24 airman writing in 1998 also noted the distinction between the character of Smoe and Kilroy (who he says was never pictured), and suggested that Smoe stood for \"Sad men of Europe\". Correspondents to \"Life\" magazine in 1962 also insisted that Clem, Mr. Chad or Luke the Spook was the name of the figure, and that Kilroy was unpictured. The editor suggested that the names were all synonymous early in the war, then later separated into separate characters.\n\nSimilar drawings appear in many countries. Herbie (Canada), Overby (Los Angeles, late 1960s), Flywheel, Private Snoops, The Jeep, and Clem (Canada) are alternative names. An advertisement in \"Billboard\" in November 1946 for plastic \"Kilroys\" also used the names Clem, Heffinger, Luke the Spook, Some, and Stinkie. \"Luke the Spook\" was the name of a B-29 bomber, and its nose-art resembles the doodle and is said to have been created at the Boeing factory in Seattle. In Chile, the graphic is known as a \"sapo\" (slang for nosy).\n\nIn Poland, Kilroy is replaced with \"\", \"Robert Motherwell\", or \"M. Pulina\". In Russia, the phrase \"Vasya was here\" () is a notorious piece of graffiti.\n\nKilroy has been seen in numerous television series and films and in computer and video games. Peter Viereck wrote in 1948 that \"God is like Kilroy. He, too, Sees it all.\" Isaac Asimov's short story \"The Message\" (1955) depicts a time-travelling George Kilroy from the 30th Century as the writer of the graffiti. Thomas Pynchon's novel \"V.\" (1963) includes the proposal that the Kilroy doodle originated from a band-pass filter diagram.\n\nKen Young wrote a parody of \"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\" which was transmitted to Apollo 8 on December 25th, 1968. It featured the lines \"When what to his wondering eyes should appear, but a Burma Shave sign saying, 'Kilroy was here.'\" Kilroy was featured on New Zealand stamp #1422 issued on March 19, 1997.\n\n\n"}

The strength, determination and attitude of Lizzie symbolise the character traits of all Paralympic Athletes.\n\nLizzie has been given the voice of Olivia Newton-John, a well-known Australian singer, actor and entertainer. Olivia made performances with Lizzie leading up to the Games, spreading the word about excellence within the Paralympic Community.\n\nThe outstanding visibility and community engagement to Lizzie the lizard ultimately led to marketing success, unrivalled by the three olympic mascots. Lizzie captured the imagination of the public, leading to the iconic representation at the Paralympic games. The Australian Paralympic Committee noted the significant branding capitol and realised that this could be leveraged in the future.\n\n"}
{"id": "74185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74185", "title": "Low comedy", "text": "Low comedy\n\nLow comedy, in association to comedy, is a dramatic or literary form of entertainment with no primary purpose but to create laughter by boasting, boisterous jokes, drunkenness, scolding, fighting, buffoonery and other riotous activity. It is also characterized by \"horseplay\", slapstick or farce. Other examples include one throwing a custard pie into another's face. This definition has also expanded to include lewd types of comedy that rely on physical jokes, for example, the wedgie.\n\nThis type of comedy has been a fixture ever since Greek plays. Low comedy was first denoted as comedy for the commoners because it was most often practiced by street performers. Over time as low comedy began to include lewd jokes and more physical comedy, more mainstream performers began to practice this type of comedy: stand-up comedians, musicals, etc. This type of comedy also was employed in most cartoons.\n\nLow comedy in society is quite well known; it can be found in a wide range of media, such as television and theatre. It can also be found in public and occupations, such as clowns, mimes and comedians. The term \"low\" is represented in association to low culture. This form of comedy is targeted and understood towards people who attain non-academic high school education, meaning this form of comedy is not restricted to high levels of education and knowledge. Low comedy is well known and popular today because it is considered suitable for all individuals. This form of comedy connects to popular culture by its easy to understand style. \n\nLow comedy, however, has lacked appreciation from most of society and is looked down upon in contrast to high comedy. The sole purpose of low comedy is to evoke laughter in people. Because there is no contextual message in most forms of low comedy, it is not highly respected. This does not undermine the fact that it is still an effective form of comedy for its reputation to cause laughter. \n\nThe classification of things considered to be low comedy constantly changes over time. As society changes, so do the ideas about what high and low comedy are. For example, due to the overdoing of sitcoms in the past, it is now considered shrill, vulgar, low society where everyone talk-screeches in some sub-human, mock-sophisticated language of incessant insult. Today, low comedy can be seen in almost any production. Sitcoms often base most of the plot on this type of comedy because of society influencing productivity and considering it a low form of comedy. Modern adaptations of Shakespeare's plays also use low comedy to convey a different understanding of the play.\n\n"}
{"id": "37339876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37339876", "title": "Pedagogical agent", "text": "Pedagogical agent\n\nA pedagogical agent is a concept borrowed from computer science and artificial intelligence and applied to education, usually as part of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). It is a simulated human-like interface between the learner and the content, in an educational environment. A pedagogical agent is designed to model the type of interactions between a student and another person. Mabanza and de Wet define it as \"as a character enacted by a computer that interacts with the user in a socially engaging manner\". A pedagogical agent can be assigned different roles in the learning environment, such as tutor or co-learner, depending on the desired purpose of the agent. \"A tutor agent plays the role of a teacher, while a co-learner agent plays the role of a learning companion\".\nThe history of Pedagogical Agents is closely aligned with the history of computer animation. As computer animation progressed, it was adopted by educators to enhance computerized learning by including a lifelike interface between the program and the learner. The first versions of a pedagogical agent were more cartoon than person, like Microsoft's Clippy which helped users of Microsoft Office load and use the program's features in 1997. However, with developments in computer animation, pedagogical agents can now look lifelike. By 2006 there was a call to develop modular, reusable agents to decrease the time and expertise required to create a pedagogical agent. There was also a call in 2009 to enact agent standards. The standardization and re-usability of pedagogical agents is less of an issue since the decrease in cost and widespread availability of animation tools. Individualized pedagogical agents can be found across disciplines including medicine, math, law, language learning, automotive, and armed forces. They are used in applications directed to every age, from preschool to adult.\n\nDistributed cognition theory is the method in which cognition progresses in the context of collaboration with others. Pedagogical agents can be designed to assist the cognitive transfer to the learner, operating as artifacts or partners with collaborative role in learning. To support the performance of an action by the user, the pedagogical agent can act as a cognitive tool as long as the agent is equipped with the knowledge that the user lacks. The interactions between the user and the pedagogical agent can facilitate a social relationship. The pedagogical agent may fulfill the role of a working partner.\n\nSocio-cultural learning theory is how the user develops when they are involved in learning activities in which there is interaction with other agents. A pedagogical agent can: intervene when the user requests, provide support for tasks that the user cannot address, and potentially extend the learners cognitive reach. Interaction with the pedagogical agent may elicit a variety of emotions from the learner. The learner may become excited, confused, frustrated, and/or discouraged. These emotions affect the learners' motivation.\n\nIt has been suggested by researchers that pedagogical agents may take on different roles in the learning environment. Examples of these roles are: supplanting, scaffolding, coaching, testing, or demonstrating or modelling a procedure. A pedagogical agent as a tutor has not been demonstrated to add any benefit to an educational strategy in equivalent lessons with and without a pedagogical agent. According to Richard Mayer, there is some support in research for pedagogical agent increasing learning, but only as a presenter of social cues. A co-learner pedagogical agent is believed to increase the student's self-efficacy. By pointing out important features of instructional content, a pedagogical agent can fulfill the signaling function, which research on multimedia learning has shown to enhance learning. Research has demonstrated that human-human interaction may not be completely replaced by pedagogical agents, but learners may prefer the agents to non-agent multimedia systems. This finding is supported by social agency theory.\n\nThe appearance of a pedagogical agent can be manipulated to meet the learning requirements. The attractiveness of a pedagogical agent can enhance student's learning when the users were the opposite gender of the pedagogical agent. Male students prefer a sexy appearance of a female pedagogical agents and dislike the sexy appearance of male agents. Female students were not attracted by the sexy appearance of either male or female pedagogical agents.\n\n"}

Although the culture of Latin America has traditionally been strongly influenced by the Roman Catholic Church, which tends to be socially conservative, pornography is now typically legal in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Argentina and Mexico. The viewing of pornography in the region has been popularized by the Internet and DVDs.\n\nPornography between consenting adults is legal in many American countries including Colombia and Uruguay.\n\nThe Bahamian penal code prohibits the production and distribution of obscene publications. Many types of pornography are prohibited in the Bahamas, however law enforcement is relaxed and does not usually enforce the prohibition. Pornography is available on Bahamian cable television and in 2014 ZNS-TV broadcast a report on the establishment of a local pornography industry in the Bahamas.\n\nIn Brazil, pornographic film actors must be 18 or older. Pornography which does not involve bestiality is legal when sold in public places. Depiction of sex with animals is legal. However, magazine and DVD covers that depict genitalia must not be visible from public view, and pornography can only be sold to people 18 or older.\n\nThe laws of Canada permit the sale of hardcore pornography to anyone over the age of eighteen. While persons below that age may have pornography in their possession, its sale to them is prohibited.\n\nMost hardcore pornography is sold in adult stores or on adult websites.\n\nChile's pornography industry began in the 1950s and grew significantly until the 1973 Chilean coup d'état. Under the subsequent military dictatorship of Chile the industry was suppressed. Following the Chilean transition to democracy and the development of the Internet, the pornography industry in the country has begun to expand again.\n\nColombia has become a big hub for live web cam streams and has seen a rise in camgirls as a result of the increase in access to the internet. Almost 98% of \"latin\" models come from Colombia while only 2% come from Mexico and Brazil.\n\nPornography is illegal in Cuba, however the laws were relaxed in the 2010s.\n\nIn the United States, pornography is not unlawful at the federal level, but is subject to the \"Miller\" test, which was developed in the 1973 case \"Miller v. California\". The Miller test was an effort to differentiate between pornography and 'obscenity.' It has three parts:\n\n\nPornography is a large industry that involves major entertainment companies, which offer pornography films through cable channels and in-room movies in hotels. Pornography distribution changed radically during the 1980s, with VHS and cable television largely displacing X-rated theaters. VHS distribution, in turn, has been replaced by DVD and Internet distribution for niche markets. Pornography generates billions of dollars in sales in the United States alone. An estimated 211 new pornographic films are made every week in the United States.\n\n"}

{"id": "16719125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16719125", "title": "Religion in Ecuador", "text": "Religion in Ecuador\n\nReligion in Ecuador is an expression of the different cultural heritages in Ecuadorian culture, including those stemming from the Spanish colonization, Native Amerindians and Afro-Ecuadorians. Christianity is the largest religion in Ecuador.\n\nAmong the old churches are new ones and many more being built by the Catholic Church. The Evangelical Missionary Union represents many Protestants in Ecuador; Anglican churches in Ecuador belong to Province 9 of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. Other religions are present in small numbers: Eastern Orthodoxy, Mormonism, Buddhism, Judaism and Islam.\n\nAccording to Latinobarómetro in 2017 equadorians returned following religious distribution:\n\n\nAccording to the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Census (2010), 91.95% of the country's population have a religion, 7.94% are atheists and 0.11% are agnostics.\n\nAfter the Spanish colonization, Ecuador became a Roman Catholic country. The Catholic Church had and still has an important place in the Ecuadorian government and society. After the Constitution of 1869, the official religion became Catholicism and only Catholics could obtain citizenship. In 1899, the liberal government of Alfaro made a new constitution which respected all religions and guaranteed freedom of religious choice. The public education became free of religious influence. Nevertheless, private catholic schools still existed. Monsignor Antonio José Cardinal González Zumárraga is the emeritus Archbishop of Quito. He is in charge of the Ecuadorian Catholic Church. The Apostolic Nuncio to Ecuador is Giacomo Guido Ottonello.\n\nIn Latin America Protestants are most often called Evangelicals (Evangelicos). Ecuador has now about 11% of the population calling itself protestant. Most are Pentecostals, but many denominations are active.\n\nThe first Mormon missionaries in Ecuador arrived in 1965. On August 1, 1999, the Guayaquil Ecuador Temple was dedicated by President Gordon B. Hinckley.\n\nLatter-day Saint membership in Ecuador has increased significantly in recent years. In 2008, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reported having 185,663 members in Ecuador.\n\nThe \"Jesus Name Apostolic Church of Ecuador\" (Iglesia Evangelica Apostolica del Nombre de Jesus) is the largest Apostolic/Pentecostal church in Ecuador with more than 100,000 members in Ecuador. Considered a Missionary Church they have churches and missions in Peru, Chile, Uruguay, Venezuela, San Salvador, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands and Israel.\n\nThe \"Jewish Community of Ecuador\" (Comunidad Judía del Ecuador) has its seat in Quito and has approximately 290 members. Nevertheless, this number is declining because young people leave the country towards the United States of America or Israel. The Community has a Jewish Center with a synagogue, a country club and a cemetery. It supports the \"Albert Einstein School\", where Jewish history, religion and Hebrew classes are offered.\nThere is a very small community in Cuenca. The \"Comunidad de Culto Israelita\" reunites the Jews of Guayaquil. This community works independently from the \"Jewish Community of Ecuador\". Jewish visitors to Ecuador can also take advantage of Jewish resources as they travel and keep kosher there, even in the Amazon Rainforest.\n\nThe \"Islam Community of Ecuador\" (Comunidad Islámica del Ecuador) is of Sunni denomination and has approximately 60 members in Ecuador. It runs the Mosque Assalam in the city of Quito.\n\nThe \"Asociación Islámica Cultural Khaled Ibn al Walidi\" reunites the Arab Muslims in the country and has its seat in Quito.\n\nThe Islamic Center \"Al Hijra\" is located in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city and economic hub, with an estimated 85 members.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith, while being registered with the government, has small numbers in the country. The Bahá'i radio in Otavalo that was started on October 12, 1977, was the first Bahá'i radio station in the world. The National Bahá'í governing body of Ecuador is based in Quito and Guayaquil.\n\nBuddhism was originally brought to Ecuador by immigrants from China and Japan. A large number of these immigrants and their descendants have retained their native religions with approximately 5,000 practicing Buddhists. In 1995 Taiwanese missionaries began building the Templo Mision Budista in Guayaquil. Finished in 2007, it opened its doors to the public in 2008 and is one of the largest Buddhist temples in South America.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church assumed a pivotal role in Ecuador virtually at the onset of the Spanish conquest. Catholicism was a central part of Hispanic culture, defining the ethos and worldview of the time. Through the Office of the Inquisition, the church examined the \"purity\" of possible officeholders. The church was virtually the only colonial institution dealing with education or the care of the needy. It amassed great wealth through donations, dowries, and outright purchases. Virtually every segment of the organization—the hierarchy, individual clerics, and religious orders—owned some form of assets.\n\nThe liberals' ascendancy in 1905 brought a series of drastic limitations to the Roman Catholic Church's privileges. The state admitted representatives of other religions into the country, established a system of public education, and seized most of the church's rural properties. In addition, legislation formally abolished tithes (although many hacienda owners continued to collect them). The 1945 constitution (and the Constitution of 1979) firmly established freedom of religion and the separation of church and state.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, the country's Catholic bishops became increasingly active in supporting social change. Church leaders organized literacy campaigns among the Indians, distributed the institution's remaining lands, assisted peasants in acquiring land titles, and helped communities form cooperatives. In the 1970s and 1980s, the bishops espoused a centrist position on social and political issues. The episcopate contended that the unjust organization of Ecuadorian society caused many to live in misery. The bishops also claimed that the economic development of the 1970s and early 1980s had merely widened the gap between rich and poor. At the same time, however, Catholics were warned against employing Marxian analyses of society or endorsing violence or class conflict.\n\nChurch support for social reform occasionally brought it into conflict with government authorities. In 1976, for example, police arrested Riobamba bishop Leonidas Proaño Villalba—the episcopate's most outspoken critic of Ecuadorian society and politics—and sixteen other Latin American bishops who were attending a church conference in Chimborazo Province. After accusing the prelates of interfering in Ecuador's internal politics and discussing subversive subjects, the minister of interior released Proaño and expelled the foreign bishops from the country. Some Catholics formed groups to support conservative causes. The Committee of Young Christians for Christian Civilization, for example, advocated scuttling the \"confiscatory and anti-Christian\" agrarian reform laws.\n\nIn 1986 the Roman Catholic Church was organized into three archdioceses, ten dioceses, one territorial prelature, seven apostolic vicariates, and one apostolic prefecture. The church had only 1,505 priests to minister to a Catholic population of slightly more than 8 million, a ratio of 1 priest for every 5,320 Catholics.\n\nAlthough approximately 94 percent of Ecuadorians were at least nominally Roman Catholic at the time, most either did not practice their religion or pursued a syncretistic version. Most Sierra Indians, for example, followed a type of folk Catholicism in which doctrinal orthodoxy played only a small part. Indigenous beliefs combined with elements of Catholic worship. Much of community life focused on elaborate fiestas that marked both public and family events. Although the precise configuration of fiestas varied from community to community, in general public fiestas involved an individual in a series of increasingly demanding and expensive sponsorships (cargos) of specific religious celebrations. By the time individuals had completed all the expected cargos, they were recognized community leaders.\n\nThe separation of state and religion is since 1986 guaranteed.\n\nThe Ecuadorian Constitution of 1998 includes two articles providing for freedom of worship:\n\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church's relatively weak presence in the countryside and in squatter settlements, coupled with the nominal, syncretistic practice of most Catholics, created a fertile ground for Protestant evangelical and Pentecostal missionary activity. Although multidenominational groups such as the Gospel Missionary Union (GMU) had been active in Ecuador since the beginning of the twentieth century, significant levels of conversion did not occur until the late 1960s. By the late 1970s, the GMU reported that it had converted 20,000 Sierra Indians in Chimborazo Province alone. The Christian and Missionary Alliance indicated that conversions among Indians in Otavalo climbed from 28 in 1969 to 900 in 1979. By the mid-1980s, an estimated 50,000 Ecuadorians had converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Other significant forces in the Protestant camp included World Vision, an evangelical development group based in California, and the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL). The Texas-based SIL dispatched linguists to remote areas of Ecuador to study and codify tribal languages. The eventual goal of such efforts was to translate the Bible.\n\nThe phenomenal pace of conversion — some observers estimated that evangelicals and Pentecostals totaled 40 percent of the population in Chimborazo Province in the late 1980s — affected social relations in rural areas. Change in religious affiliation was a major rupture with an individual's past traditions and social ties, effectively removing him or her from participation in fiestas—a major focus of much of community life. Families and extended families found the break with the rest of the community easier in the company of fellow converts. Protestantism replaced the patterns of mutual reciprocity characteristic of peasant social relations with a network of sharing and support among fellow believers. This support system extended to migrants; converts who left for the city or the coast sought out their coreligionists for assistance in finding lodging and employment even as Catholics looked to their compadres.\n\n \n\n"}

{"id": "1589348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1589348", "title": "Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)", "text": "Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)\n\nFollowing the trend of contemporary \"Sonic\" games such as \"Sonic Adventure\" and \"Sonic Heroes\", \"Shadow the Hedgehog\" is a 3D platform game; however, it also features third-person shooter elements. Most levels have three possible missions—\"Hero,\" \"Dark,\" or \"Normal\"—that the player may choose to complete, while some have only two of the three. The missions completed determine the game's plot and subsequently playable levels, a feature referenced by the game's tagline. The plot centers on the attempt of Shadow, a creation of Doctor Eggman's grandfather, Professor Gerald Robotnik, to learn about his past while suffering from amnesia. To defeat enemies, Shadow can use various weapons and special attacks.\n\n\"Shadow the Hedgehog\" received generally unfavorable reviews from critics. The game was criticized for its controls, plot, and dark themes, especially the addition of guns and other weapons to traditional \"Sonic\" gameplay. However, some reviewers praised its replay value. The game was a commercial success, selling more than 2 million copies by March 2007.\n\n\"Shadow the Hedgehog\" is a platform game that incorporates elements of action-adventure gameplay. Like previous games in the \"Sonic\" series, basic gameplay involves running quickly, collecting rings, and destroying enemies. Shadow collects rings as a form of health; when he is attacked by an enemy, ten of his rings bounce away from him in all directions. If he is hit by an enemy while not having any rings, he loses a life. Each level is completed by undertaking a mission, and each mission is labeled \"Hero,\" \"Dark,\" or \"Normal.\" The \"Hero\" missions involve completing tasks for the \"Sonic\" series' heroic characters, or Doctor Eggman on one occasion, and the \"Dark\" missions involve completing tasks for the Black Arms or Doctor Eggman. The \"Normal\" missions involve reaching the Chaos Emerald or goal at the end of the level. All enemies attack Shadow regardless of the mission chosen. The mission types selected affect the plot, the levels played, and the ending received out of ten possibilities. Each level features cutscenes that advance the story, and several levels also feature boss battles.\nNew gameplay features distinguish \"Shadow the Hedgehog\" from previous \"Sonic\" games. For example, Shadow can use guns to combat enemies, adding an element of third-person shooter gameplay. Parts of the scenery, such as traffic signs, can also be used as weapons. Another new feature is the ability to drive vehicles, such as motorcycles and alien aircraft. Although Shadow can outrun the game's vehicles, the latter have unique capabilities, such as crushing enemies and traversing otherwise impassible acid-covered areas.\n\nAs in most \"Sonic\" series games, the Chaos Emeralds play a major role; they help Shadow remember his past and allow him to perform Chaos Control and Chaos Blast. Chaos Control allows Shadow to move more quickly in levels and slows time in boss battles, and Chaos Blast creates an explosion that destroys or severely damages all nearby enemies. Shadow can perform Chaos Control after the player fills the Hero Gauge by defeating Black Arms soldiers, and he can perform Chaos Blast after filling the Dark Gauge by defeating G.U.N. soldiers.\n\nThe game includes a two-player mode that retains the single-player mechanics but is set in one of three specially designed stages and uses a vertically split screen to separate each player's view. Each player chooses one of the available characters—Shadow, two metallic versions of him, and palette-swapped variants of each. The combatants attack each other and steal each other's rings until all but one are eliminated. Additionally, in single-player mode, a second player may take control of Shadow's sidekick character in some stages.\n\nShadow the Hedgehog, the game's titular protagonist, was created 50 years before the game's events by Professor Gerald Robotnik in an orbital military research space colony known as the ARK. Robotnik was trying to unlock the secrets of eternal life on the government's orders and create the \"Ultimate Life Form.\" To that end, Robotnik designed Shadow to harness the powers of the Chaos Emeralds. At the end of \"Sonic Adventure 2\", his first in-game appearance, Shadow was presumed dead, but he returned in \"Sonic Heroes\" with amnesia that persists into the events of \"Shadow the Hedgehog\".\n\nThe Guardian Units of Nations (G.U.N.) is the military of Earth's government, the United Federation, and it is directed by the G.U.N. Commander. When completing \"Hero\" missions, Shadow usually helps G.U.N. and heroic characters from the \"Sonic\" series, including Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Rouge, Omega, Vector, Charmy, and Espio. Their aim is to protect Earth from both Doctor Eggman and the Black Arms, an army of various related alien species that invade Earth from the Black Comet. Black Doom, the leader of the Black Arms, sends an extension of himself called \"Doom's Eye\" to watch Shadow and help him complete missions. When completing \"Dark\" missions, Shadow helps either Black Doom or Doctor Eggman, each of whom wants the Chaos Emeralds for himself. In one \"Hero\" mission of Sky Troops, Shadow assists Doctor Eggman in battling the Black Arms.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, Shadow suffers from amnesia. Other than the events of \"Sonic Heroes\" that took place three months prior, Shadow remembers only two things: his name and his attempt to escape the space colony ARK with his creator's granddaughter Maria, who was killed by G.U.N. soldiers. Having walked through a room filled with androids that looked like him during the events of \"Sonic Heroes\", Shadow wonders if he too is an android. The game starts with Shadow reminiscing outside the city of Westopolis when the alien race Black Arms drops out of the sky and invades the city. One Black Arms alien, Doom's Eye, approaches Shadow, and the Black Arms's leader Black Doom tells Shadow of an old agreement Shadow made: to bring Black Doom the Chaos Emeralds. Stunned that Black Doom knew his name, Shadow searches for the Chaos Emeralds to learn about his past.\n\nThe game progresses through the Westopolis level and five more levels from the different paths Shadow may take. As missions are completed, Shadow learns more about his past and regains memories. He can choose to help Doctor Eggman or the Black Arms, to help G.U.N. and the series' heroic characters, or to help neither and keep the Chaos Emeralds for himself. The missions completed determine which one of ten possible endings will be seen after Shadow collects all the Chaos Emeralds and defeats one of the game's final bosses. The possible ending events range from planning to defeat the Black Arms to planning to destroy the planet.\n\nCompleting all ten endings unlocks the game's true ending in which Black Doom uses Chaos Control, enhanced by the power of all seven Chaos Emeralds, to bring the Black Comet to the Earth's surface. Black Doom explains that the Black Arms intend to use humans as an energy source, and the Black Comet begins to release a nerve gas into the Earth's atmosphere that causes total paralysis in those who inhale it. Shadow confronts Black Doom after the \"Last Way\" level, where he discovers that Professor Gerald Robotnik created the ARK's Eclipse Cannon weapon to destroy the Black Comet. During their confrontation, Black Doom reveals that Shadow was created using Black Doom's blood, and he attempts to use mind control on Shadow, but fails. Black Doom then transforms into a giant called Devil Doom; in response, Shadow uses the Chaos Emeralds to transform into Super Shadow and confronts Devil Doom. During the battle, Doctor Eggman confirms to Shadow that he is the original and not an android. Shadow defeats Devil Doom and uses Chaos Control to teleport the Black Comet back into Earth's orbit, where he obliterates it using the Eclipse Cannon. His friends are elated, as are people at G.U.N. headquarters. Shadow is then shown in the ARK's control room holding up a photograph of Maria and Gerald. He discards the photograph and leaves the room, deciding to put the past behind him and move on.\n\n\"Shadow the Hedgehog\" was developed by Sega Studios USA, the now-defunct United States division of Sega's Sonic Team, and published by Sega. Sega first revealed the game and its tagline (\"Hero or villain? You decide.\") at the March 8, 2005 inauguration of Sonic the Hedgehog into the Walk of Game. Sega formally announced development of the game for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox video game consoles on March 23, 2005. The same year, Sega released the game in North America on November 15, in Europe on November 18, and in Japan on December 15.\n\nSonic Team's Takashi Iizuka, who had worked on the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series since 1993, targeted a younger audience with previous \"Sonic\" games and wanted to attract an older audience with \"Shadow the Hedgehog\". The game's development team wanted to make a game featuring Shadow to resolve plot mysteries that began with the character's introduction in \"Sonic Adventure 2\". The team felt that Shadow's design—inspired by films such as \"Underworld\", \"Constantine\", and the \"Terminator\" series—would make the story darker and allow for elements, such as vehicles and weapons, otherwise considered inappropriate for a \"Sonic\" game. Sonic Team's Yuji Naka stated in an interview with GameSpy that he wanted to use Shadow as the game's main character due to his popularity among fans and being the best fit for a \"gun action\" game. The game features several CG-animated cutscenes produced by Blur Studio. The game also contains profanities, including instances of \"damn\" and \"hell\" spoken by Shadow and other characters such as Espio, the G.U.N. Commander, Knuckles, and Sonic. Profanity and the use of guns, both firsts for the \"Sonic\" series, generated pre-release controversy. The ESRB assigned the game a rating of E10+ for \"fantasy violence\" and \"mild language\".\n\nThe music of \"Shadow the Hedgehog\" was composed by Jun Senoue, Yutaka Minobe, Tomoya Ohtani, and Mariko Nanba. \"Lost and Found: Shadow the Hedgehog Vocal Trax\" is a video game soundtrack album released on CD on February 22, 2006. The album contains seven vocal songs from the game, one of which is a remix rather than the original. Another soundtrack, \"Shadow the Hedgehog: Original Soundtrax\", was also released on February 22, 2006. It contains both vocal and instrumental tracks from the game. The game was the first in the \"Sonic\" series to use the 4Kids cast from \"Sonic X\" following the death of Doctor Eggman's previous voice actor, Deem Bristow. This cast continued to be used until late 2010 when all cast members except for Mike Pollock were replaced before the release of \"Sonic Free Riders\".\n\n\"Shadow the Hedgehog\" received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, many of which were highly critical of its gameplay mechanics and differences from other \"Sonic\" games. However, it was voted the best game of 2005 in the \"Official Jetix Magazine\" Reader Awards and named the \"Best Platformer\" of 2005 by \"Nintendo Power\" readers (receiving more votes than the staff's choice, \"Sonic Rush\"). \"Shadow the Hedgehog\" was also a commercial success: Sega reported 1.59 million units sold from its release to March 2006 and 470,000 units sold in the U.S. from March 2006 to March 2007, for total sales of at least 2.06 million. The game was later released as a part of three budget lines: Greatest Hits and Platinum Range for the PlayStation 2 (representing sales of at least 400,000 in North America and Europe, respectively) and Player's Choice for the GameCube (250,000 in North America).\n\nMany critics derided the game's sense of maturity for a \"Sonic\" game, especially the addition of guns and other weapons. \"Game Informer\" staff writer Matt Helgeson said, \"not only is this new 'adult' interpretation of Sonic painfully dumb, it’s also ill-advised and almost feels like a betrayal to longtime fans.\" Eurogamer staff writer Tom Bramwell felt that \"the game's other selling point – its darker edge – [is] not really meant for us.\" G4's \"X-Play\" and GameSpy staff writer Patrick Klepek thought similarly. In contrast, \"Nintendo Power\" staff writer Steve Thomason rated the game 8.0 out of 10, stating, \"this darker take on the Sonic universe succeeds for the most part, giving the series a bit of an edge without going overboard on violence.\" In addition, \"Official Xbox Magazine\" reassured readers, \"Don't worry, \"Shadow the Hedgehog\" isn't half as 'urban' or quite as 'gangsta' as it first seems.\" Hegelson panned the game's \"laughable\" plot, saying it \"makes no sense,\" and that various \"Sonic\" conventions undermined its attempts to be \"mature\" or \"edgy\".\n\nReviewers also criticized the game's controls, especially Shadow's homing attack causing unexpected character deaths. \"Game Informer\"s Matt Helgeson complained that the attack \"frequently sends you careening off into nothingness, resulting in cheap death after cheap death.\" \"Nintendo Power\", \"X-Play\", Eurogamer, \"Official Xbox Magazine\", and GameSpy agreed. Other complaints focused on the mechanics of weapons and vehicles. Greg Mueller of GameSpot felt that the guns were nearly useless because of a lack of a target lock or manual aim, combined with an ineffective auto-aim. IGN staff writer Matt Casamassina, 1UP.com staff writer Greg Sewart, \"Game Informer\", \"X-Play\", GameSpy, and London's \"The Times\" also criticized the mechanics of Shadow's weapons, vehicles, and other aspects of the game's controls. However, Thomason said that \"blasting Shadow's foes with the wide variety of weapons at his disposal is just plain fun.\"\n\nThe level design received mixed comments. Mueller called some levels \"extremely frustrating\". Helgeson stated that the fast-paced \"levels are poorly designed\", and Andrew Reiner, who wrote a second-opinion review for \"Game Informer\", called the level design \"disastrous\". \"Official Xbox Magazine\" was more mixed, balancing the possibility of getting lost in the large levels with the likely appeal of these stages to 3D \"Sonic\" gamers, particularly those who had enjoyed \"Sonic Heroes\". GameTrailers found that \"the levels are either dark and urban, or bright and psychedelic. Either way, they fit in well to the \"Sonic\" universe. They are loaded with speed ramps, loops and an assortment of other boosts that rocket Shadow like a pinball.\" Bettenhausen included \"the classic run-like-hell roller coaster design philosophy\" of some stages in his limited praise. Casamassina disliked the \"stupid level design\", saying that \"[j]ust because they dazzled players six years ago does not mean that Sonic Team can copy and paste exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect everyone to be happy with the outcome.\" GameSpy observed that \"the areas are much less open than in previous \"Sonic\" games, but the level designers haven't taken advantage of the constraints.\" \"Nintendo Power\" singled out the difficulty of the missions that require the player to locate objects.\n\nCritics praised the game's replay value, applauding the many possible paths that a player may take through the game. GameTrailers stated, \"this choose-your-own-adventure style gives the game replay value that many platformers lack.\" The Melbourne, Australia, publication \"Herald Sun\", \"Nintendo Power\", and \"Official Xbox Magazine\" thought similarly. GameSpot praised the variety of alternate endings, but concluded that \"the gameplay isn't fun enough to warrant playing the game through multiple times.\" Bettenhausen thought that the morality system felt artificial, but said that it extended the game's replay value.\n\n"}

Social change may include changes in nature, social institutions, social behaviours, or social relations. also in history, once learned: is REPS. R-Religion E-Economical P-political S-social. Which is a very helpful strategy for identifying changes.\n\nSocial change may refer to the notion of social progress or sociocultural evolution, the philosophical idea that society moves forward by evolutionary means. It may refer to a paradigmatic change in \nthe socio-economic structure, for instance a shift away from feudalism and towards capitalism. Accordingly, it may also refer to social revolution, such as the Socialist revolution presented in , or to other social movements, such as Women's suffrage or the Civil rights movement. Social change may be driven by cultural, religious, economic, scientific or technological forces.\n\nChange comes from two sources. One source is random or unique factors such as climate, weather, or the presence of specific groups of people. Another source is systematic factors. For example, successful development has the same general requirements, such as a stable and flexible government, enough free and available resources, and a diverse social organization of society. On the whole, social change is usually a combination of systematic factors along with some random or unique factors.\n\nThere are many theories of social change. Generally, a theory of change should include elements such as structural aspects of change (like population shifts), processes and mechanisms of social change, and directions of change.\n\nOne of the most obvious changes currently occurring is the change in the relative global population distribution between countries. In the recent decades, developing countries became a larger proportion of world population, increasing from 68% in 1950 to 82% in 2010, while population of the developed countries has declined from 32% of total world population in 1950 to 18% in 2010. China and India continue to be the largest countries, followed by the US as a distant third. However, population growth throughout the world is slowing. Population growth among developed countries has been slowing since the 1950s, and is now at 0.3% annual growth. Population growth among the less developed countries excluding the least developed has also been slowing, since 1960, and is now at 1.3% annual growth. Population growth among the least developed countries has slowed relatively little, and is the highest at 2.7% annual growth.\n\nIn much of the developed world, changes from distinct men's work and women's work to more gender equal patterns have been economically important since the mid-20th century. Both men and women are considered to be great contributors to social change worldwide.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1711644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1711644", "title": "Syphon Filter", "text": "Syphon Filter\n\nSyphon Filter is a third-person shooter action video game series developed by SCE Bend Studio (formerly Eidetic) and published by Sony Computer Entertainment (previously 989 Studios), that has appeared on the PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable game systems. In the series, \"Syphon Filter\" is the name given to the mysterious biological weapon.\n\nThe plot centers on special agents Gabriel Logan and Lian Xing who are tasked by the United States government to apprehend an international terrorist named Erich Rhoemer.\n\nThe plot picks up immediately after where the previous Syphon Filter ended. Gabe sets out to cure the virus while being targeted as a terrorist by the US government.\n\nGabe and his team are suspected of treason. Summoned to prove their innocence, the team recounts the incidence that led to this moment. In the background, Gabe moves to rid the world of Syphon Filter once and for all.\n\nGabe, now commander of a government agency, leads fresh recruits in the battle to stop a deadlier strain of the virus from emerging. Follow the new recruit, Cobra, as he/she fights the omega strain virus.\n\nVoiced by: John Chacon (\"Syphon Filter\" 1-3) & James Arnold Taylor (\"Omega Strain\", \"Dark Mirror\", \"Logan's Shadow\")\n\nGabriel \"Gabe\" Logan is the main protagonist of the series. Born in Camden, New Jersey, Gabe served in the 75th Ranger Regiment and fought in Grenada. He met Lian Xing in 1987, during a mission in Soviet-occupied Afghanistan. He served in the Persian Gulf War. In 1993 he joined the Agency.\n\nIn \"The Omega Strain\", Gabe is appointed Commander-In-Chief, and reforms the Agency, naming it the International Presidential Consulting Agency (IPCA). In , Gabe is shot four times in the chest by Trinidad at the end of the game. A Sony representative, artist Athey Moravetz, confirmed he was killed during this firefight.\n\nVoiced by: Ava Fang (\"Syphon Filter\"), Zoe Galvez (\"Syphon Filter\" 2, 3) & Kim Mai Guest (\"Omega Strain\", \"Dark Mirror\", \"Logan's Shadow\")\n\nLian Xing is Gabe Logan's partner in the Agency and later the IPCA. Born in Kashi, China, she first met Logan in Afghanistan in 1987, both working on assignments against the Soviets. During the 1990s, Lian was then working for the IPCA as Logan's partner. In the second game, it is revealed that before she joined the Agency, she was an agent of the Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China.\n\nIn \"Logan's Shadow\", it is revealed that she has a husband, Shen Rei. It is also revealed that she is in love with Gabe. Lian may be the last surviving character of the original series after the events at the end of \"Logan's Shadow\".\n\nVoiced by: Shannon Tilton\n\nTeresa Lipan is a former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent, voiced by Shannon Tilton in all appearances. Originally from Phoenix, Arizona, she implied that her family is of Native American descent during her testimony in the third game. She graduated from college and started working for the ATF in 1992. In her first mission for the ATF, Lipan was caught in the middle of a conspiracy with National Security Agency agents. With the help of an undercover Gabe Logan, Teresa saves her fellow ATF agents and as many militia men as she can. She also saves Dusty and Debbie Oakton, family relatives of Earl Oakton, a mountain survivalist who was executed by NSA agents.\n\nIn the series, Teresa Lipan started working for the Agency in 1994, but prior to the events of the first game she leaves the Agency, upon discovering what the Agency really was. At the end of \"Syphon Filter 2\", Teresa decide to fake her death after getting shot and seriously injured by turncoat CBDC agent Jason Chance. In \"Syphon Filter 3\", she tracked down Russian spy Mara Aramov and managed to expose her and Secretary of State Vince Hadden about the agency's activities while testifying about her involvement with the conspiracy.\n\nAlthough initially reluctant, Teresa joined the IPCA to provide backup reconnaissance in \"Omega Strain\". In \"Logan's Shadow\", Teresa is shot by Trinidad at the end of the game. Whether she survived is unknown.\n\nVoiced by: Bryan Session (\"Syphon Filter\" 2 & 3) & Khary Payton (\"Omega Strain\", \"Dark Mirror\")\n\nLawrence Mujari is a friend of Teresa Lipan, introduced in the second game. He was a former soldier in the Umkhonto we Sizwe during the time of apartheid. In Syphon Filter 2 he reveals that he has a medical degree, saying \"I'm a pathologist, not an hemathologist\". It is also known, for example according to his Senate testimony given during \"Syphon Filter 3\", Mujari testified it was in this role that he first encountered the Syphon Filter virus, during his 1984 investigation of a new disease outbreak at a gold mine located in Mpumalanga. Mujari has a flashback during this testimony; during this flashback, the player controls him while he carries out that investigation.\n\nAfter seeing the effects of viral infections firsthand, Mujari left his previous work and joined the Agency, in which he trained as a biochemist. He was a strong believer in non-lethal force (although he killed numerous people during his 1984 mission) and had a deep personal aversion to violence, but did kill in self-defense. Mujari is killed by Chinese agent Trinidad at the end of \"Logan's Shadow\".\n\nThe Consortium was a fictional organization that appeared in the first two games, that controlled the Agency, an MIB style black ops-counter-terrorism organization of the U.S. Government, and also helped fund Pharcom's development of the Syphon Filter virus.\n\nThey planned to sell the virus on the black market to various terrorists & criminal groups such as Black Baton, the Yakuza, and insurgents in Russia, as part of their plan to usurp control of various first world Governments such as America, Russian, China & Britain. Members include Mihai Niculescu, Vincent Hadden, Mara Aramov, Jonathan Phagen, Thomas Markinson, Edward Benton, Lyle Stevens, Mr. Cochran, Murukawa Industries, Russian gangsters and various corrupt members of the US Government.\n\nVoiced by: Alastair Duncan\n\nMihai Niculescu was a Swiss billionaire and the major antagonist of the series; his role being the overall commander of The Consortium. He is introduced in \"The Omega Strain\". Niculescu is later killed by two criminal gunmen when his records are erased by a virus planted by an IPCA agent while in Zurich.\n\nVoiced by: Bob Saenz (\"Syphon Filter\" 3)\n\nVincent Hadden was the United States Secretary of State and the second-in-command of The Consortium. He first appeared in the first game as the shadowy figure who tells Markinson that they will \"wait and see what he [Gabe Logan] can discover\". He is later seen talking to Aramov. He is also featured at the beginning of the second game and later during the game with his face shadowed again, and finally seen talking to Aramov at the end of the game. He appears more often in the third installment. In the beginning of the second game, he explains the nuclear launch that was caused at the end of the first game to the public. In the end, he appeared spying on Logan, Xing and Mujari, beside Teresa Lipan's grave.\n\nIn the third game, he calls for Logan, Xing and Mujari to testify. He questions each person, while being intrigued by their stories. It is revealed that Hadden was the leader behind The Agency and The Consortium. Aramov kills Hadden. Mujari notes that leadership in The Consortium is rapidly shifting after Hadden's death.\n\nVoiced by: Anna Murivitskaya (\"Syphon Filter\"), Elina Fillipova (\"Syphon Filter 2\"), Corina Harmon (\"Syphon Filter 3\") & Jennifer Hale (\"Omega Strain\", \"Dark Mirror\")\n\nMara Aramov was an ex-KGB agent and one of the major antagonists in the series. In 1997, as revealed in \"Dark Mirror\", Victor Yavlinski, boss of the Yavlinski Crime family in Kaliningrad, hired Mara Aramov to assassinate his opponents throughout the city. She killed six of Yavlinski's nemesis in cold blood on December 24, while they were sleeping with their wives or lovers, \"leaving the kids empty clips instead of presents\", as Logan stated.\n\nBy 1999 she worked as an assassin for Black Baton but later defected to the Consortium. She executed Logan's colleague Ellis, and later killed Hadden in \"Syphon Filter 3\". She also makes a notable appearance in \"The Omega Strain\", where her ties to the Consortium leader, and the man behind Syphon Filter conspiracy, Mihai Niculescu, are revealed. She is the one who tires to stop Ivankov from launching a nuclear missile against Moscow, but she fails due to Niculescu's interests in making profit out of this bombing. Instead, Niculescu orders his men to execute Mara. She, however, is rescued by Gabe Logan, who came to Niculescu's villa estate looking for evidence linking Niculescu to Syphon Filter. Mara refused to help Gabe hunt down Niculescu, but instead she helped Gabe find Ivankov's base, who was aware of Ivankov's plans to launch it against Moscow. As reward for help in stopping Ivankov, Gabe offers Mara to retire in peace and quiet, leaving her alone.\n\nAt the end of \"The Omega Strain\", Stoneman can be seen aiming through his rifle's telescopic sight apparently about to assassinate her, as Gabe decided that the price for leaving her alive was too high. In a bonus mission in \"Dark Mirror\", it is revealed that she and Weissinger were involved in a secret love affair. It is also revealed that Stoneman had orders to eliminate them. Stoneman set up in an apartment, down the street from Aramov's residence. After eliminating Aramov's bodyguards, Stone kills Aramov and Weissinger.\n\nIn \"The Omega Strain\", Elsa Weissinger reveals in her deposition that she knew Mara for quite a long time. Mara offered Elsa a job in the Syphon Filter research and introduced her to the project's financier: Mihai Niculescu. Elsa accepted, feeling that she will have the power to change the world.\n\nVoiced by: Art Freedman\n\nJonathan Phagan was the chief executive officer of Pharcom and an important player in the Syphon Filter conspiracy. He was introduced in the first game. Phagan was captured by Aramov to find out the location of the actual Syphon Filter labs. Logan knocks out Aramov, but Phagan escapes.\n\nPhagan is later seen underground at Rhoemer's cathedral, being held prisoner. Phagan attempts to escape, but Aramov shoots him in the head. He reappears in the second game, somehow still alive but brain-dead and on life support while having been infected with the Syphon Filter virus. The group's lead scientist, Dr. Elsa Weissinger, wanted to keep Phagan for studies, but Agency operative Dillon Morgan cut off his life support.\n\nVoiced by: Eric R. Hilding\n\nThomas Markinson was the commander of the Agency, which contained himself, Logan, Xing, Ellis, Edward Benton and various other operatives.\n\nMarkinson commanded Logan and Xing throughout Washington D.C., where the terrorist group called the \"Black Baton\" was attacking. Benton was in charge of commanding a raid at Washington Park, led by Jenkins. Jenkins and his team were wiped out. Markinson placed Benton on leave due to his performance. It was revealed later at an exhibition center that Benton was actually working with the Black Baton group. Logan kills Benton, and later questions Markinson. Markinson explains that he knew Benton was working with the group, and he was trying to get a lead.\n\nThis later worked, as it led Logan and Xing to a base in Kazakhstan. Xing was \"killed\" due to an ambush by Rhoemer. Logan reveals this to Markinson, who had a backup chopper waiting. They escape as Rhoemer's base goes up in flames.\n\nMarkinson drops Logan off at a cathedral run by Rhoemer. This time, Markinson wants Logan to cure the test subjects held within the cathedral. Logan does this by injecting each test subject with a vaccine. While underground, Logan finds Jonathan Phagan (a corrupt executive at Pharcom, the company that was supplying the Black Baton group) and Xing, who was captured, not killed. It is revealed that Xing caught the Syphon Filter virus, and the vaccine Logan had was used to kill the test subjects, not cure them. This was to silence any news that would get out. Both are later met by Mara Aramov, who severely injures an escaping Phagan. Aramov willingly takes Logan and Xing to Phagan's warehouses in Kazakhstan. Markinson is seen at the end of the game. He explains that he was trying to capture the virus for the Agency. Rhoemer appears and kills Markinson.\n\nVoiced by: Frederick L. Gillette\n\nEdward Benton was the deputy director of the Agency introduced in \"Syphon Filter\", and later appearing in \"Syphon Filter 3.\" He filed all the reports for field agents Logan and Xing. He also filed reports for other field agents such as another operative known as Jenkins. Jenkins and his team were told to enter Washington Park, where a viral bomb was being held. What Jenkins and his team did not realize was that Black Baton was prepared. Jenkins and his team were ambushed and eliminated. Benton was later spotted by Logan at an exhibition center party for Pharcom. It was revealed that he was working for Aramov and Phagan. Logan kills Benton in the process.\n\nIn \"Syphon Filter 3\", Logan tells a story about when he was an Army Ranger. He first tells about his first assignment in Afghanistan, which involved delivering supplies to the rebels in the area. Logan, his commanding officer Ellis, and Benton, who claimed to be a CIA operative, were the only survivors after the ambush. They later successfully made it to the camp, where Benton later recruited Logan and Ellis into the Agency. After Logan finished testifying, he admitted that he had no idea Benton was actually an Agency operative.\n\nVoiced by: Dan Kennedy\n\nLyle Stevens appears in \"Syphon Filter 2\" as the head of the Agency. He is seen various times throughout the game, commanding his fellow agents. His main concern was to retrieve the Syphon Filter data discs that Logan held. Stevens agrees to make a trade; the data discs for the Syphon Filter vaccine. He's later killed by Logan after betraying and imprisoning him.\n\nAppearing only in the third game, Silvers was a corrupt US Military officer, affiliated with both the NSA and the Consortium. Tasked to reclaim data from a downed Government satellite, he and his men posed as FBI agents in an effort to reclaim the data, but were thwarted by Teresa Lipan. In the present day, he was tasked with covering up the Consortium's activities in Australia, by executing both the aboriginal test subjects, and the science team led by Dr. Elsa Weissinger, but was again thwarted in his attempts, this time by Lian Xing, who promptly killed him.\n\nVoiced by: Peter Kepler\n\nJason Chance was a lieutenant who worked for the Chemical and Biological Defense Command in \"Syphon Filter 2\". After serving in Desert Storm, he headed the response team during the attempted Syphon Filter attack on Washington D.C. Chance was introduced in \"Syphon Filter 2\", when Logan finally met him at the PharCom warehouses outside of Almaty, Kazakhstan after the events of \"Syphon Filter\". Upon returning to the United States, the C-130 carrying his team, and Logan, is shot down during an Agency operation. In the subsequent events, it is presumed that Chance and his team did not survive. While infiltrating the Agency's laboratory in New York City, Logan finds that Chance and one of his subordinates, John Ramirez, is still alive.\n\nLogan and Teresa Lipan, after being pursued by SWAT cops and the Agency throughout the city, find Chance waiting for them at their evacuation point. Chance seemingly kills Lipan and then reveals that he was a mole for the Agency. Logan had realized that back in the Rockies, the Agency knew where to find them nearly every time, and were there to meet Logan and Xing no matter where they were. It is also revealed that Chance was responsible for orchestrating Lian's capture, and killed Ramirez. Logan kills Chance by shooting him into the tail rotor of a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, decapitating him.\n\nVoiced by: Bill Glanting\n\nDillon Morgan was an Agency commander reporting directly to Agency Director Lyle Stevens. He is seen in \"Syphon Filter 2\". As the armed forces commander of the Agency, he was responsible for attempting to sell the Syphon Filter virus to rogue nations. After Archer failed to retrieve the data discs, Morgan and his troops head to the exhibition center, where the backup discs were. Logan, Xing and Lipan notice that the discs they got from Archer were not enough, so Logan and Lipan also head to the exhibition center. Morgan attempts to plant various bombs, but Lipan quickly disarms them. Logan kills Morgan and retrieves the other half of the data discs.\n\nVoiced by: Mark Atherlay\n\nDerek Falkan was Morgan's second in command. He was introduced in \"Syphon Filter 2\". In the beginning, he led a group of agents to ambush Logan and Xing, taking Xing with them. Falkan is seen various times, talking to other members of the Agency. He planned to head back to the Agency headquarters via his personal helicopter. He waits for Thomas Holman, whom Xing knocked out to get information. Falkan decides to leave without him. As he attempts to enter his helicopter, Xing kills him and escapes.\n\nVoiced by: James Anders\n\nSteven Archer is an assassin who appears in \"Syphon Filter 2\" as one of the primary antagonists. He is also Dillon Morgan's lieutenant. During the first half of the game, it is Archer that commands his men to track down Logan. He first does so by destroying the aircraft Logan was on. The aircraft contained important data to help cure the Syphon Filter virus. Archer and Logan race to the crash site to retrieve these discs. Archer reaches the discs first, but as he attempts to escape, Logan kills him.\n\nVoiced by: Andrea Satin (\"Syphon Filter\" 2, 3) & B.J. Ward (\"Omega Strain\", \"Dark Mirror\")\n\nDr. Elsa Weissinger was a doctor for PHARCOM, the Agency, and the IPCA. First introduced in the second game, Weissinger works for the Agency. She attempts to study the effects of the Syphon Filter virus. She fails, after Xing, infected, escaped the group's custody. Near the end of the game, Logan forces Weissinger to finish a vaccine while inside the Agency's lab.\n\nIn the third game, Weissinger is remembered in a flashback mission, told by Xing. Weissinger was in Costa Rica, getting plant samples. Her involvement with the Agency started here. In a current mission later in the game, Weissinger crosses paths with Xing in Australia. She was at a refugee camp in which villagers were being tested with the Syphon Filter virus. Lian forces Weissinger to create a cure. She gives Xing a data disk that involves Aramov and leaves.\n\nDuring the events of \"The Omega Strain\", Weissinger was recruited into the IPCA, doing medical research on the Omega Strain virus. She eventually manages to create a vaccine, but she requests a recruit kill one of her mentors, Jandran. Weissinger leaves a note confessing her mental instability, about wanting to create and break things for the world with her medical knowledge.\n\nIn \"Dark Mirror\", Weissinger is seen at Aramov's apartment. Gary Stoneman, a member of the IPCA, kills both Weissinger and Aramov.\n\nVoiced by:\n\nFormer acquaintance of Lian Xing.

The group was in cahoots with PHARCOM.\n\nVoiced by: Doug Boyd\n\nErich Rhoemer is the main antagonist who Logan was trying to kill in the first game. He was responsible for the original attack on Washington D.C. Using Syphon Filter, Rhoemer planned to kill everyone in Washington D.C. Logan foiled the plan.\n\nAfter his failed attack on Washington, Rhoemer had Benton go to the Pharcom Exposition Center in New York with Aramov to meet with Phagan. After the meeting with Phagan goes badly and Logan arrives, Aramov kidnaps Phagan. With Benton killed by Gabe, Rhoemer escapes.\n\nRhoemer next appears at the Pharcom warehouses after Aramov joins Logan and Xing. At the warehouses, Rhoemer's and Phagan's men are engaged in a massive firefight. It is revealed that Rhoemer is trying to start a war between the U.S. and Russia by launching a missile loaded with Syphon Filter at the U.S. Markinson is shot and killed by Rhoemer. Gabe then proceeds to detonate the missile mid-flight and takes out Rhoemer using gas grenades.\n\nRhoemer reappears in the \"Syphon Filter 3\", in flashback missions during Gabe's testimony to the senate. The mission sets Gabe back in Costa Rica, where Rhoemer and his men were attempting to get plant samples for the virus.\n\nVoiced by: Jason Cusson\n\nAnton Girdeux was a French terrorist. A journeyman machinist by training, he was drafted into the Black Bataon ranks as a munitions expert by Rhoemer. He uses a Flamethrower and wears a special protective suit that is impenetrable even to bullets, though it causes him to move very slowly. He takes part during the Black Baton's attack on Washington D.C. early in game, Girdeux's mission was to protect the main viral bomb placed in the Washington Memorial.

In \"Syphon Filter 2\", his name is retconned to Vladimir and his character makes an appearance in multiplayer.\n\nAlec Kabanov was the commander of Rhoemer's stronghold in Uzhhorod, Ukraine.\n\nRed Section is a paramilitary group that developed the Dark Mirror nerve gas in \"Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror\".\n\nVoiced by: James Horan\n\nSingularity, real name, Grant Morrill, is the commander of Red Section. Once an accountant with Interpol, Morrell laundered billions of corporate funds into several off-shore accounts and created his own personal army, and became the infamous Singularity.\n\nHe funded several projects with Aerospace in creating futuristic electromagnetic body armor and weapons. Using his advanced combat gear, Singularity led Red Section to his true target, a Kemsynth black op project codenamed Dark Mirror. The first area he investigated was the oil refinery, sending Black King to the site. After he failed, Singularity sent White Scorpion and Black Viper to Iquitos, Peru, in a plantation area where Kemsynth was harvesting several plants used in Dark Mirror, but the real target was Kemsynth operative, Addison Hargrove. Singularity sent White Scorpion to take her because she had possessed all essential data to synthesize Dark Mirror. Eventually Singularity learned that the mission was a failure, but was surprised to learn that co-commander of Red Section, Touchstone took matters into his own and kidnapped Addison's daughter, Blake. Singularity and Touchstone used Blake as a bargaining chip to get the disc, although the two never intended to let either Addison or Blake live.\n\nFinally, after Touchstone managed to obtain the disk by force, which led to Touchstone's demise at the hands of Logan, Singularity wasted no time in using Dark Mirror. Singularity learned all about Logan using Interpol accounts to obtain his dossier.\n\nSingularity manages to bring Dark Mirror to the Aerospace subway station which could take him all through Europe. But Logan faces off against Singularity and kicks him in front of an oncoming subway car, which strikes Singularity, killing him instantly.\n\nVoiced by: TC Carson\n\nTouchstone, real name Stuart Coleman, was introduced in \"Dark Mirror\". Touchstone is one of the two leaders of the terrorist organization, Red Section, and a former NSA agent.\n\nTouchstone first appears in a Russian casino, killing the head of security, and ordering his unit to eliminate everyone in the casino. But after learning that the Kemsynth head of security was still alive, and was in communication with Logan, Touchstone decided to use Blake, daughter of Kemsynth head of security, Addison Hargrove as a bargaining chip.\n\nAt the meeting place, Addison senses this, and pleads for Logan to show up as backup. Touchstone asks for the disks while Addison demands to know the whereabouts of her daughter. Logan watches over the meeting, but is unaware that Addison is growing angrier, until she attacks Touchstone. She misses, but Touchstone does not. Addison is kicked over the railings to her apparent death. Enraged, Logan fires at Touchstone but misses, while Touchstone escapes and sends his snipers after Logan.\n\nAfter ridding the area of all Red Section personnel, Logan reaches a sky lift zone in search for Touchstone. Touchstone sneaks up on Logan, and beats him senseless. Logan manages to defeat Touchstone, and kills him.\n\nBlack King is the commander responsible for the assault on the Kemsynth Oil Refinery in Alaska. After ordering all Red Section terrorists to kill the refinery workers, Black King begins to interrogate Kemsynth secretary Kriesler, who provides no information, so Black King beats Kriesler down and ties him up in an air purification chamber where poison gas is leaking.\n\nAfter learning that Black King's second in command, Red Jack, has been killed by an intruder, he begins his work on the man in charge of the refinery, Malcolm Freeman. But Logan and Xing make it through Black King's troops, and find Freeman out cold, being guarded by a lone soldier.\n\nBlack King, now furious, knocks out his own soldier, and takes over, attempting to take out Logan. Black King is killed by Logan. Logan and Xing check on Malcolm Freeman but find out that he committed suicide by swallowing a cyanide pill.\n\nVoiced by: Charity James\n\nAddison Hargrove was Logan's first partner 12 years ago. She later disappeared for reasons unknown at the time. In \"Dark Mirror\" she is found being held at gunpoint by a Red Section member in order to get an ingredient for Dark Mirror. She later reveals to Gabe that she has a daughter, Blake, who is being held by Red Section. She left the Agency because of her pregnancy.\n\nIn an attempt to get her back, she heads to a mountain facility and demands that Touchstone tells where he's holding her daughter, with Gabe watching over. After growing impatient, she attempts to attack Touchstone, but misses. Touchstone then kicks Hargrove over the railing of the facility, and to her apparent death. At the end of the game, it is revealed that Addison did not die, and that Logan is the father of Hargrove's daughter.\n\nVoiced by: James Sie\n\nShen Rei was Xing's husband. He was kidnapped by al-Jamil along with Xing. He helped Logan shut down the XZ2 bombs before Logan faces Bitar. After that, he commits suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head to prevent his capture by Trinidad.\n\nVoiced by: Robin Atkin Downes\n\nDane Bishop is a skilled diver and weapons expert who owns his business and is in love with Teresa, but Teresa does not like him. He is introduced in \"Logan's Shadow\". He helps Logan in an underwater mission. He operates his mini-submarine and opens the broken hull of the sunken USS St. Helens so that Logan is able to enter. After Logan exits from the sunken ship, Bishop, along with Logan, finishes off the Spetsnaz divers but the submarine of Spetsnaz shows up to destroy Bishop's mini-sub. Logan opens all the hatches to allow depth charges to blow up the submarine to protect Bishop. In a bonus mission called \"Killing Time\", Bishop, as the only playable character, would get 16 valuables to salvage. The mission also reveals that Bishop has a girlfriend named Cassia.\n\nVoiced by: Jason Marsden\n\nPrivate Janzen is a rookie UN peace keeper. During an attack on the UN Border Base, Zivmovic forces led by Goran Zivmovic attack the UN base and wipe out Janzen's entire team. When Gabe Logan enters the base to rescue the UN forces, he spots Janzen captured by Zivmovic. Logan rescues the frightened Private Janzen and attempts to reunite him with the other survivors in his unit, but as they trek through the UN base, they find all of his unit has been killed.\n\nThey meet up with a UN medic, (Richard Kress), who drops a wounded UN peace keeper to the floor, demanding medication otherwise the UN peace keeper will die. So Logan goes for medication while Janzen and Kress keep an eye on the peace keeper. Logan eventually finds out that Kress is a mole and as he makes it back, he discovers the UN peace keeper and Janzen both on the floor dead. Logan eventually tracks down Kress and kills him, avenging Janzen's death.\n\nVoiced by: J.S. Gilbert\n\nUri Gregorov was a fictional head of the SVR. Gregorov is introduced in \"Syphon Filter 2\" when he led a convoy to Kazakhstan in response to an ICBM launch in that country. Arriving before Logan and a team from the U.S. Army's Chemical and Biological Defense Command (CBDC) leave the area, he discovers that the Agency had abducted Lian Xing. He had claimed that he was good friends with Xing. After Logan and the CBDC team recover PharCom data discs regarding the Syphon Filter virus from Kazakhstan, the data was later discovered to be incomplete. It was concluded that Gregorov had found the second half of the data disks. Gregorov was captured by Aramov and sent to the Aljir Prison, with an impostor being put in his place. Xing eventually finds out about Gregorov's fate and goes to rescue him. After being extracted, Gregorov gives the data disks to Logan while trying to prevent a war with People's Republic of China personnel, headed by General Shi-Hao. In \"Syphon Filter 3\", Gregorov was leading the Soviet troops in the occupation of Afghanistan.\n\nIn \"The Omega Strain\", Gregorov had a very small role, though Russia and Chechnya were at the brink of war. Russian military forces were forced to bombard Mikhas Ivankov's (a Russian leader) hometown in Chechnya, inflicting civilian casualties. The aftermath was photographed by Mujari, with Logan confronting Gregorov about the incident. From that point on, Gregorov was never heard from again.\n\nJohn Ramirez was a member of CBDC. He is seen in \"Syphon Filter 2\". While on an aircraft over the Rockies, the flight is shut down. CBDC agents Ramirez, Chance and Logan were all on the aircraft. Everyone on the plane managed to escape. Most of the CBDC agents were killed by Agency operatives.\n\nWhile attempting to escape, Ramirez is found by Logan. They meet up on an interstate bridge, but the bridge gets shot down by Archer's co-pilot. Logan survives but Ramirez and another CBDC agent go missing.\n\nRamirez reappears in a holding cell at the Agency's headquarters, along with Chance. The other CBDC agent was killed when the bridge was destroyed. Logan sends Chance to free Ramirez, but when Logan goes back to Ramirez's cell, he is found dead, later revealed to have been murdered by Chance. During his confrontation with Logan on the roof of the parking garage, Chance taunts Logan in revealing to him that Ramirez died believing Logan, not Chance, to be the traitor.\n\nVoiced by: Shannon Ward (\"Syphon Filter\" 3), Jennifer Hale (\"Omega Strain\", \"Logan's Shadow\")\n\nMargaret \"Maggie\" Powers is a member of MI-6, a counter-terrorist group based in the UK. She helps Logan in Ireland by destroying shipments of the Syphon Filter virus. She later appeared in Australia, where she helps Xing by piloting a helicopter and providing radio backup. She also reappears in \"The Omega Strain\", providing an IPCA agent backup while in Belarus.\n\nIn \"Logan's Shadow\", she assists Logan after he frees her from captivity. She provided covering fire for Gabe as they went through a prison, where she was captured and saved again by Logan. She is later taken into custody after it is revealed that MI-6 wanted Shen's device as well as Shen himself.\n\nVoiced by: Alex Veadov\n\nKudrenko is the leader of a Spetsnaz unit in Moscow and an antagonist in Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow. He is highly regarded by his superiors. He operates in Italy, Russia, and the Indian ocean. Kudrenko was targeted by Logan but managed to escape, leaving 50% of his body covered in burns. Logan eventually kills him in a shootout on a cargo plane.\n\nVoiced by: Boris Lee Krutonog\n\nSergeyev is Kudrenko's right-hand man. Sergeyev and his team of Spetsnaz divers were sent by Kudrenko to retrieve the codes from a dead courier that remained on board the St. Helens. Sergeyev spots Logan and Bishop disabling the ship's nuclear reactor. Logan kills him in a shootout and retrieves the courier codes.\n\nVoiced by: Joey Naber\n\nGhassan al Bitar was the leader of al-Jamil and the primary antagonist of Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow. His brother was killed in Afghanistan, fighting with the Taliban. Bitar's goal was to eliminate westerners in Middle East. He was affiliated with al-Qaeda. Bitar was responsible for the kidnapping of Rei and Xing. He is the main antagonist in \"Logan's Shadow\" and is killed in the end when the XZ2 explosive on his transport is shot by Logan, causing it to explode.\n\nVoiced by: David O'Brian\n\nRobert Cordell is an antagonist in \"Logan's Shadow\". He was the Deputy Director of National Intelligence Oversight Committee (NIOC), who pursues Bitar with such tenacity that leads Logan to believe he is driven by something more than just making up for his mistake of letting Bitar escape. After shutting down Logan's Agency and launch the ill-fated \"Operation Canyon Storm\" on al-Jamil's base, he was exposed by Logan as the one who hired Bitar to steal the XZ2 device and capture Shen, pursuing him only to cover up his own trail. He was arrested by US military forces at Logan's personal order, but somehow manages to talk to Trinidad in the bonus level \"Shadowed\".\n\nVoiced by: Gwendoline Yeo\n\nLeung Cha Qiao, code name Trinidad, is a Chinese CSS agent who trained Lian Xing before she joined IPCA, 15 years before the events of \"Logan's Shadow\". In this game, Trinidad is on a mission to capture Shen Rei to return him to her country. She helps Logan take out Kudrenko's Spetsnaz, but later abandons him. In Tyorma Prison, she frees Logan so that he could rescue Maggie Powers. While in Nahr Al-Khabur, she is captured by al-Jamil, but Logan rescues her. She gives Logan an access code, but again runs away. After al-Jamil's downfall, she attempts to force Lian and Gabe to surrender Rei to her. Shen then kills himself to prevent capture, and Trinidad leaves. At the end (after the credits), Lian and Logan find Mujari dead and Teresa severely injured. Trinidad, who is responsible, then appears and shoots Logan, who returns fire, killing Trinidad. Logan however, is wounded (possibly mortally) in the attack.\n\nGoran Zivmovic is a leader of the forces which attack the UN base. He showed up driving a tank to kill Logan. After the tank is destroyed, Logan found him dead.\n\nViktor Yavlinsky is the leader of a syndicate who runs the Konigsberg Casino. He worked with Red Section because of Touchstone. He was killed by Logan before Touchstone's troops show up. It was revealed that Yavlinsky hired Aramov to eliminate his enemies.\n"}
{"id": "37293865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37293865", "title": "The Man-Eating Myth", "text": "The Man-Eating Myth\n\nThe Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology and Anthropophagy is an influential anthropological study of socially sanctioned cultural cannibalism across the world, which casts a critical perspective on the existence of such practices. It was authored by the American anthropologist William Arens of Stony Brook University, New York and first published by Oxford University Press in 1979.\n\nArens' primary hypothesis is that despite claims made by western explorers and anthropologists since the 15th century, there is no firm, substantiable evidence for the socially accepted practice of cannibalism anywhere in the world, at any time in history. Dismissing claims of cultural cannibalism made against the Carib and Aztec peoples by invading Spanish colonialists, he tackles 19th and 20th century claims regarding socially acceptable cannibalism in Sub-Saharan Africa and New Guinea. Turning to prehistory, he critiques archaeological claims to have discovered evidence for such practices in Europe and North America. In the second half of the work, Arens puts forward his argument that an erroneous belief in \"others\" who commit socially sanctioned cannibalism is a global phenomenon. He proceeds to chastise the anthropological community for perpetuating the \"Man-Eating Myth\", suggesting reasons as to why they have done so.\n\n\"The Man-Eating Myth\" was widely reviewed in academic journals and also attracted attention from mainstream press. Views were mixed, with most reviewers highlighting the intentionally provocative nature of the work. Critics charged Arens with constructing straw man arguments and for exaggerating the methodological problems within anthropology. Although influential, in ensuing decades, increasing archaeological study of cannibalism led many to dismiss Arens' hypothesis.\n\nWilliam Arens undertook the research for his PhD in Tanzania, Eastern Africa. After beginning his fieldwork in a rural community there in 1968, he discovered that the locals referred to him as \"mchinja-chinja\", a Swahili term meaning \"blood-sucker\". This was due to a widespread belief in the community that Europeans would collect the blood of Africans whom they killed, convert it into red pills, and consume it. He would note that by the time he left the community a year-and-a-half later, most of the locals still continued to believe this myth.\n\nIn the preface to \"The Man-Eating Myth\", Arens notes that he was first inspired to begin a fuller investigation of cannibalism while teaching an introductory course on anthropology at Stony Brook University, New York. One student asked him why he focused his teaching on such topics as kinship, politics and economics rather than the more \"exotic\" subjects of witchcraft, fieldwork experiences and cannibalism. Arens concurred that these latter topics would interest his students to a greater extent than those which he was then lecturing on, and so undertook an investigation into the prior accounts of cannibalism in the anthropological record.\n\nAs he began to read up on the written accounts of cultural cannibalism, he was struck by inconsistencies and other problems in these tales. In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who had witnessed the practice of cultural cannibalism first-hand, he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, but again failed to come up with any first-hand documented cases. Prior to its publication, rumors had circulated in the anthropological community that Arens was putting together a book that would challenge the concept of cultural cannibalism.\n\nIn chapter one, \"The Nature of Anthropology and Anthropophagy\", Arens discusses the study of anthropophagy, or cannibalism, within the anthropological discipline. Noting that anthropologists have widely taken it for granted that there are societies who socially sanction cannibalism, he nevertheless states that there is no \"adequate documentation\" for such practices anywhere in the world. In the second part of the chapter, he explores several first-hand accounts of cannibalism and highlights their implausible and inaccurate nature. Beginning with the German Hans Staden's claims to have encountered socially sanctioned cannibalism among the Tupinambá people of South America in the 1550s, Arens illustrates a number of logical contradictions in Staden's account, and highlights the dubious nature of the text. The anthropologist then moved on to the 19th-century accounts of widespread socially approved cannibalism among the Polynesian people of Rarotonga in the Cook Islands provided by Ta'unga, a Polynesian native who had been converted to Christianity and wrote for the London Missionary Society; Arens again highlights a number of inconsistencies and logical impossibilities in Ta'unga's claims.\n\nThe second chapter, entitled \"The Classic Man-Eaters\", explores the accounts of cannibalism produced by European colonialists and travellers in the Americas during the Early Modern era. It begins by documenting the Spanish interaction with the Carib people of the Lesser Antilles, first begun by Christopher Columbus and his men in the 1490s. Columbus noted that the Caribs had been described as cannibals by the neighbouring Arawak people of the West Indies, but was initially sceptical about such claims himself. Arens highlights that it was only later, when Columbus began to oversee largescale colonization and pacification of Carib lands, that he began to assert that they were cannibals, in order to legitimize his cause. Arens then proceeds to note that the Spanish government only permitted the enslavement of cannibals in the Caribbean, leading European colonists to increasingly label the indigenous peoples as cannibalistic in order to increase their economic power. Following on from this, Arens goes on to critique the longstanding claims that the Aztec people of Mexico were cannibals; noting that while the early Spanish accounts of the Aztecs include first-hand descriptions of human sacrifice, he highlights that none of these Spanish observers actually witnessed cannibalism, despite the claims that were later made asserting the cannibalistic nature of Aztec religion. In contrast, Arens argues that the Aztecs found the idea of cannibalism – even in survival conditions – socially reprehensible, and believed that some of their neighbouring peoples were guilty of it.\n\nChapter three, \"The Contemporary Man-Eaters\" explores the claims made for socially sanctioned cannibalism in the 20th century, with a particular focus on Sub-Saharan Africa and New Guinea. Regarding the former, Arens discusses E. E. Evans-Pritchard's work in disproving that the Azande people were cannibalistic, before arguing that the stories of socially accepted cannibalism in the \"Dark Continent\" were based largely on misunderstandings and the sensationalist claims of European travellers like Henry Morton Stanley, and that there was no reputable first-hand accounts of such a practice anywhere in Africa. Instead, he notes that many African societies found cannibalism to be a reprehensible anti-social activity that was associated with witchcraft, drawing comparisons with the Early Modern European witch hunt. Moving on to look at claims for cannibalism in New Guinea made by anthropologists like Margaret Mead and Ronald Berndt, he notes that none of them ever actually came across any evidence of the practice themselves, before going on to critique claims that cannibalism was the cause of the \"kuru\" outbreak among the New Guinean Fore people in the mid 20th century.\n\nIn the fourth chapter, entitled \"The Prehistoric World of Anthropophagy\", Arens deals with archaeological arguments for socially approved cannibalism in European and North American prehistory. He argues that many early archaeologists, in viewing prehistoric societies as \"primitive\" and \"savage\", expected to find widespread evidence of cannibalism within the archaeological record, just as social anthropologists were claiming that the practice was widespread in recently documented \"primitive\", \"savage\" societies. He critiques various claims that broken bones represent evidence of cannibalism, both in Iron Age Yorkshire and in the case of Peking Man, maintaining that these breakages could represent many different things rather than cannibalism. He then moves on to look at North American examples, including those from the Pueblo period in the Southwestern United States and among the Iroquois in the country's northeast, in both instances critiquing an interpretation of socially sanctioned cannibalism.\n\nThe penultimate chapter, \"The Mythical World of Anthropophagy\", consists of Arens' argument that all human groups have been accused of socially accepted cannibalism at one point in time, and that these cannibals are often usually thought of as \"others\", being outside of the accuser's society, and are associated with certain animals because of their \"non-human\" behaviour. From this, he deduces that the belief in cannibalism is a \"universal phenomenon\", and questions why this should be so. He suggests that societies gain a sense of self-meaning by conjuring the image of an opposite culture that breaks societal taboos. He also describes the manner in which many societies hold origin myths that involve them once being incestuous cannibals before they became civilised, in this way referencing the ideas expressed by the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud in his \"Totem and Taboo\". He then proceeds to discuss a variety of other related issues, such as the connection between cannibalism and witchcraft, the role of gender and class in cannibal claims, and the role of the Eucharist.\n\nIn \"The Mythical World of Anthropology\", Arens looks at the manner in which anthropologists have approached the idea of cultural cannibalism. Noting the widespread western idea that cannibals exist \"beyond the pale of civilization\", in the land of savagery and primitivism, he argues that anthropologists have taken it upon themselves to explain and rationalize the cannibalism of such \"primitives\" without first proving that they were cannibalistic to start with. He connects this to the attitude held by many westerners both past and present that they are the bearers of civilization who have helped to put a stop to cannibalism. Challenging and criticizing the anthropological community's long-term advocacy of what he considers the \"Man-Eating Myth\", he draws comparisons with the belief in demonic witchcraft and cannibalism in Europe that led to the witch trials of the Early Modern period, ending his work on a quote from the historian Norman Cohn's book \"Europe's Inner Demons\".\n\nIn \"The Man-Eating Myth\", Arens notes that he was unable to find any form of \"adequate documentation\" for the existence of socially sanctioned cannibalism in any recorded society. As such, he remained \"dubious\" that cannibalism has ever existed as an approved social activity. He nevertheless refused to rule out the possibility that it had ever occurred, maintaining that the correct methodological stance was to hold an open mind on the issue, and that it would be impossible to conclusively state that no society throughout human history has ever culturally sanctioned cannibalism. From this definition of \"cultural cannibalism\" he excludes those instances where people have resorted to cannibalism under survival conditions, or where individuals have committed cannibalism as an anti-social activity that is condemned by the rest of their community.\n\nArens considers the belief in cannibalism to be a \"universal phenomenon\" that has been exhibited in all inhabited regions of the world. He expresses his view that \"all cultures, subcultures, religions, sects, secret societies and every other possible human association have been labeled anthropophagic by someone.\" He notes that accusations of socially sanctioned cannibalism in a society typically arise from an alternative society with whom they are often in conflict. As evidence, he notes that pagan Romans labelled the early Christians as cannibals, despite the lack of any evidence for this, and subsequently Christians in Medieval Europe labelled Jews as cannibals, again without any corroborating evidence.\n\nHe argues that across the world, cannibals are viewed as non-human entities, committing acts that no human would ordinarily perpetrate. In this way they were akin to various non-human species of animal, and Arens notes that in some societies, cannibals are believed to physically transform into different species in order to kill and consume humans.\n\nArens proceeds to ponder the question as to why societies across the world believe that other, exotic societies exhibit cannibalism. He notes that the development of a \"collective prejudice\" against a foreign entity provides meaning for the group by conjuring up an opposite who commit social taboos. He also suggests that one society's belief that a foreign society is cannibalistic might arise from an inability to differentiate between the latter's conceptions of the natural and the supernatural. As evidence, he asserts that rumors that the Indigenous Americans of Northeastern Canada were cannibals arose when foreign societies learned of their folkloric beliefs in man-eating giants who lived in the wilderness and conflated this fantasy with reality.\n\nArens' third primary argument is that ever since the development of the discipline, the anthropological community have continually perpetuated the \"Man-Eating Myth\" that cultural cannibalism was widespread across the world. In this way, he sees anthropologists as following in the path of Christian friars from the Early Modern period who asserted the existence of cannibalism \"beyond the pale of civilization\", in societies that are either historically or geographically distinct to western culture. He furthermore argues that both Christian proselytizers and academic anthropologists have sought to accuse non-western, non-Christian peoples of cultural cannibalism in order to then explain and rationalize their \"savage\" ways; in doing so, he argues, they continue to portray the Christian west as a civilizing influence on the world that suits their own socio-political agendas. In this way, Arens feels that the \"Man-Eating Myth\" furthers the \"we-they\" dichotomy between westerners and non-westerners, and has indirectly lent some justification for the western exploitation of \"savage\" non-western peoples.\n\nHe does not believe that there was any conscious academic conspiracy to spread the claims of cultural cannibalism, instead believing that they have arisen as a result of poor methodologies that have been used in this area, namely a lack of properly scrutinizing sources. He furthermore suggests that anthropologists have failed to tackle this issue because – while novel ideas are certainly welcomed – they feared that by criticising long-held core assumptions, they would be upsetting the established \"status quo\" within the discipline, and would ultimately tarnish the reputation of anthropology itself by suggesting that it had made major errors.\n\n\"The Man-Eating Myth\" was reviewed by Ivan Brady for the \"American Anthropologist\" journal. He noted that the framework for Arens' scepticism was not coherent and was never spelled out explicitly in the text, even if it could be deduced from reading the entirety of the work. Brady sees this framework as an \"unsophisticated\" version of positivism and naturalism, an approach that he laments was becoming increasingly popular in anthropology. Casting a critical eye over Arens' scepticism, he admits to being perplexed as to why only \"direct observation\" will do as evidence, pondering whether Arens would accept anything short of affidavits by practicing cannibals as evidence for the practice. Brady notes that there are other activities in the world that surely go on – such as masturbation in monasteries and homosexual activity in the armed forces – but that these would be hidden by a veil of secrecy and therefore difficult to observe directly, suggesting that the same may be true for cannibalism. Moving on, Brady attacks Arens' criticism of anthropology, believing that he has constructed a straw man argument by comparing the early accounts of travellers to the later, 20th-century accounts of anthropologists, and lambasts him for portraying himself as an objective figure in the debate. He argues that in cases such as that of the Carib people, the evidence for cannibalism is \"indeterminate\", rather than negative, as Arens believes. Concluding his review, Brady admits that he agrees with Arens' premise that socially accepted cannibalism is not as globally widespread as some anthropologists have suggested, but disagreed that anthropologists have been as \"reckless\" in their claims as Arens charges them with, and furthermore disagrees with Arens' suggestion that the cause can be blamed on poor observation standards.\n\nThe journal \"Man\" published a highly negative review by P. G. Rivière of the University of Oxford. Criticizing what he saw as the \"chatty 'Holier-than-Thou' tone\" of the book, Rivière asserted that at only 160 pages of text, Arens had failed to give sufficient attention to the subject and evidence, instead devoting much of the space to constructing and demolishing straw men arguments. Coming to the defence of those who believe the account of Staden regarding cannibalism among the Tupinambá by arguing that it could indeed reflect the German explorer's genuine experiences, Rivière notes that Arens has not tackled all of the claims which assert that this South American people committed anthropophagy. Furthermore, he expresses his opinion that Arens' work has made him reassess the evidence for Tupinambá cannibalism, the existence of which he is now even more thoroughly convinced. Proclaiming it to be both a \"bad\" and a \"dangerous\" book, he finally expresses his fear that it might prove to be \"the origin of a myth\". Similarly, Shirley Lindenbaum of the New School for Social Research published her highly negative review of Arens' work in the journal \"Ethnohistory\". Casting a critical eye on his claims, she notes that his use of source material was \"selective and strangely blinkered\", which detracted from his ideas of \"collective prejudice\" which she considers valuable. Critiquing his discussion of the Fore people of New Guinea as being littered with inaccuracies, she draws comparisons between cannibalism and sexual activity, noting the latter is also not directly observed by anthropologists but nonetheless undoubtedly goes on. She furthermore expresses surprise that the work was ever designed for a scholarly audience because of its poor levels of accuracy.\n\nJames W. Springer of Northern Illinois University reviewed Arens' book for \"Anthropological Quarterly\". He hoped that the book would in part have a positive legacy, in that it might make anthropologists look more closely and critically at their source material, and praised its criticism of the claims regarding Aztec cannibalism. He nevertheless proclaimed that Arens was \"almost certainly wrong\", making use of faulty evaluation methods and being excessively critical of any and all claims for cultural cannibalism, failing to prove dishonesty or prejudice on the behalf of Europeans who have claimed evidence for cultural cannibalism. He criticises both Arens' treatment of Staden's claims and his discussion of Iroquois cannibalism, claiming that Arens has neglected to mention many Native American first-hand testaments as to the cannibalistic nature of these people. Ultimately, he dismissively asserted that \"The Man-Eating Myth\" \"does not advance our knowledge of cannibalism.\" More favourably, R.E. Downs of the University of New Hampshire reviewed the work for \"American Ethnologist\". Noting that the book was \"provocative\" in its thesis, he felt that it was bound to raise many \"hackles\", and that it would lead future anthropologists to challenge other long-standing beliefs about non-western \"primitive\" societies, such as that of widespread incest and promiscuity. Ultimately, he remarked that while many anthropologists might dispute Arens' ideas, never again could they claim that the existence of cultural cannibalism was an undisputed fact.\n\nThe geographer Thomas Krabacher of the University of California undertook a review of \"The Man-Eating Myth\" for the journal \"Human Ecology\". Believing that a critical study of cannibal claims has been long needed, he was nevertheless perturbed that Arens' work failed to be either comprehensive or objective. Although concurring that reports of cannibalism have been all too readily accepted without being properly scrutinized, Krabacher nonetheless argues that he has used a \"careless and selective\" approach to the literary sources. He also sees problems in Arens' approach to the nature of the evidence, stating that the anthropologist has not given sufficient thought to what would constitute reliable testimony in the case of cannibalism. Drawing comparisons with sexual behaviour, he notes that it would not always be possible for a western anthropologist to directly view cannibalism, which would likely be hidden from their view by many practitioners, and that as such, second-hand accounts would have to do. He then critiques Arens' writing style, believing it to be \"contentious and possibly offensive\", and highlighting a number of typological errors.\n\nKhalid Hasan's review of \"The Man-Eating Myth\" appeared in the \"Third World Quarterly\" journal. Considering it to be a \"brilliant and well documented\" tome, he praised Arens' \"admirable\" work and expressed his hope that others would expand on his initial thesis. The German journal \"Anthropos\" published a largely positive review of Arens' work by John W. Burton, in which he described it as an \"extensive and meticulous\" study which was the model of a \"fair and reasoned argument\". Supporting Arens' arguments, he proclaimed that the final chapter should be essential reading for all anthropologists.\nP. Van de Velve reviewed the book for the Dutch journal \"Anthropologica\". Van de Velve felt that the book contained several weaknesses, for instance Arens did not, he notes, explain how the claim for cultural cannibalism can be successfully refuted. The Dutch scholar also noted that the argument that anthropology focused on examining \"non-bourgeoisie\" cultures was not new. Ultimately however, Van de Velve considered it to be a well written book that offered \"good reading\", particularly for students.\n\nArchaeologist Paola Villa, one of the primary excavators of Fontbrégoua Cave, a Neolithic site in Southeastern France where the team argued for the existence of cannibalism, made reference to Arens' work in a 1992 paper of his published in the \"Evolutionary Anthropology\" journal. Villa noted that following the book's publication, prehistorians always dealt with suspicions of cannibalism with \"extreme reluctance and scepticism\".\n\nThe English archaeologist Timothy Taylor critically discussed Arens' work in his book \"The Buried Soul: How Humans Invented Death\" (2002). Proclaiming that \"there is now overwhelming biological, anthropological and archaeological evidence that cannibalism was once all around us\", he attacked Arens for his blanket and \"bizarre\" accusations against the concept of cultural anthropophagy. He argued that \"The Man-Eating Myth\" had become so influential upon publication because it was what a generation of anthropological and archaeological students wanted to hear, not because it represented a coherent argument, citing P.G. Rivière's negative review in \"Man\". Commenting on the situation in archaeology, he felt that following the publication of Arens' work, archaeologists had ceased to cite cannibalism as an explanation, to the detriment of the discipline itself. Presenting evidence to counter Arens' claims, Taylor cites the accounts of cannibalism among Pom and Passon, two chimpanzees of Gombe National Park whose anti-social activities were recorded by Jane Goodall, and from this discusses the evolutionary benefits of cannibalism. Proceeding to defend various ethnographic accounts of cultural cannibalism, he argues that this thoroughly disproves the beliefs which \"Arensite\" anthropologists find it \"comfortable or fashionable\" to believe. Later in \"The Buried Soul\", he proclaims that Arens' book is pervaded by a \"hollow certainty of viscerally insulated inexperience\", and he claims that such a flawed methodology has echoes in the anthropologist Jean La Fontaine's \"Speak of the Devil: Tales of Satanic Abuse in Contemporary England\" (1998); Taylor himself suggests that multiple claims of the Satanic ritual abuse have been incorrectly dismissed for being considered \"improbable\".\n\nArens' book was also briefly mentioned by the Scottish archaeologist Ian Armit in his book, \"Headhunting and the Body in Iron Age Europe\" (2012). Armit noted that though the book was influential, most anthropologists would \"probably\" argue that Arens' wholesale dismissals had gone \"too far\". He also saw Arens' work as symptomatic of a trend within anthropology to neglect the \"undesirable\" cultural practices of non-western societies.\n\nArens' book gained attention from the popular press soon after its publication.\n\n"}

All record a moment before the death of his older sister Johanne Sophie (1862–1877) from tuberculosis at 14. Munch returned to this deeply traumatic event again and again in his art, over six completed oil paintings and many studies in various media, over a period of more than 40 years. In the works, Sophie is typically shown on her deathbed accompanied by a dark-haired, grieving woman assumed to be her aunt Karen; the studies often show her in a cropped head shot. In all the painted versions Sophie is sitting in a chair, obviously suffering from pain, propped by a large white pillow, looking towards an ominous curtain likely intended as a symbol of death. She is shown with a haunted expression, clutching hands with a grief-stricken older woman who seems to want to comfort her but whose head is bowed as if she cannot bear to look the younger girl in the eye.\n\nThroughout his career, Munch often returned to and created several variants of his paintings. \"The Sick Child\" became for Munch—who nearly died from tuberculosis himself as a child—a means to record both his feelings of despair and guilt that he had been the one to survive and to confront his feelings of loss for his late sister. He became obsessive with the image, and during the decades that followed he created numerous versions in a variety of formats. The six painted works were executed over a period of more than 40 years, using a number of different models.\n\nThe series has been described as \"a vivid study of the ravages of a degenerative disease\". All of the paintings and many of the ancillary works are considered significant to Munch's oeuvre. An 1896 lithograph in black, yellow and red was sold in 2001 at Sotheby's for $250,000.\n\nEach painting shows Sophie in profile, lying on her deathbed, and obviously having difficulty breathing, a symptom of advanced, severe tuberculosis. She is propped from her waist up by a large thick white pillow which partially hides a large circular mirror hung on the wall behind her. She is covered by a heavy dark blanket. She has red hair and is shown as frail and with a sickly pallor and vacant stare. She looks towards a dark and portentous full-length curtain to her left, which many art historians interpret as a symbol of death.\n\nA dark-haired and older woman in a black dress sits by the child's bedside, holding her hand. The bond between the two is established through the joining of their hands, which are positioned at the exact center of each work. Their shared grip is typically rendered with such pathos and intensity that art historians believe that not only did the two figures share a deep emotional bond, but that they were most likely blood relations. In probability the woman is Sophie's aunt Karen. Some critics have observed that the older woman is more distressed than the child; in the words of critic Patricia Donahue, \"It is almost as though the child, knowing that nothing more can be done, is comforting a person who has reached the end of her endurance\". The woman's head is bowed in anguish to the extent that she seems unable to look directly at Sophie. Because of this, her face is obscured and the viewer can only see the top of her head. A bottle is placed on a dressing table or locker to the left. A glass can be seen to the right on a vaguely described table.\n\nThe paintings vary in their colourisation. White especially figures in the first in the series, a representation of oblivion. Later, green and yellow figure as expressive representations of sickness, while in most works the reds represent the most dramatic and physical feature of late stage tuberculosis: coughing up blood.\n\nEvery piece in the series is strongly influenced by the conventions of German Expressionism, while many are heavily impressionistic in technique. The painted versions are built up from thick layers of impasto paint, and typically show strong broad vertical brush strokes. The emphasis on verticals gives the works a hazy feel and adds to their emotive power, an effect the art critic Michelle Facos described as presenting the viewer with \"a scene experienced at close range but hazily, as if viewed through tears or the veil of memory\".\n\nMunch was only 26 when he completed the 1885–86 painting and uncertain enough of his ability, he gave it the tentative title \"Study\". Munch completed six paintings titled \"The Sick Child\". Three are now in Oslo (1885–86, 1925, 1927), the others in Gothenburg (1896), Stockholm (1907), and London (1907). He created eight studies in drypoints and etching after his breakthrough in 1892 when demand for his work grew. The first version took over a year to complete. Munch found it an unhappy and frustrating experience, and the canvas was worked and reworked almost obsessively. Between 1885 and 1886 Munch painted, scrubbed out and repainted the image, before finally arriving at an image he was satisfied with. He often mentioned the works in his journals and publications, and it features heavily in his \"The Origin of the Frieze of Life\" (\"Live Friesens tilblivelse\"). He later wrote that the 1885–86 painting was such a difficult struggle that its completion marked a major \"breakthrough\" in his art. Munch explained: \"I started as an Impressionist, but during the violent mental and vital convulsions of the Bohême period Impressionism gave me insufficient expression—I had to find an expression for what stirred my mind ... The first break with Impressionism was the Sick Child—I was looking for expression (Expressionism).\" \n\nThe six painted versions are:\nBritish and Norwegian scientists have investigated the painting in the Nasjonalmuseet Oslo. The pigment analysis revealed an extensive palette consisting of pigments such as lead white, zinc white, artificial ultramarine, vermilion, red lake, red ochre, emerald green, chrome yellow, zinc yellow, and cobalt blue.\n\nIn 1930, Munch wrote to the director of Oslo's National Gallery admitting that \"As for the sick child, it was the period I think of as the Age of the Pillow. A great many painters did pictures of sick children on their pillows.\" Munch was referring to the prevalence of tuberculosis at the time; contemporary depictions of the disease can be seen in the works of Hans Heyerdahl and Christian Krohg.\n\nWhen the 1885–86 original version was first exhibited at the 1886 Autumn Exhibition in Christiania, it was jeered by spectators and drew \"a veritable storm of protest and indignation\" from critics dismayed at his use of impressionistic techniques, his seeming abandonment of line, and the fact that the painting seemed to be unfinished. Many found it unsatisfactory that the key passage in the painting - the women's joined hands - was not well detailed, there are no lines to describe their fingers and the centerpiece essentially comprises blobs of paint. In defence Munch said, \"I don't paint what I see but what I saw.\"\n\nThe exhibition was reviewed by the critic Andreas Aubert, who wrote: \"There is genius in Munch. But there is also the danger that it will go to the dogs ... For this reason, for Munch's own sake, I would wish that his Sick Child had been refused ... In its present form this 'study'(!) is merely a discarded half-rubbed-out sketch.\"\n\nOver 40 years later, the Nazis deemed Munch's paintings \"degenerate art\" and removed them from German museums. The works, which included the 1907 version of \"The Sick Child\" from the Dresden Gallery, were taken to Berlin to be auctioned. Norwegian art dealer Harald Holst Halvorsen acquired several, including \"The Sick Child\", with the goal of returning them to Oslo. The 1907 painting was purchased by Thomas Olsen in 1939 and donated to the Tate Gallery.\n\nOn 15 February 2013, four Norwegian postage stamps were published by Posten Norge, reproducing images from Munch's art to recognise the 150th anniversary of his birth. A close-up of the child's head from one of the lithographic versions was used for the design of the 15 krone stamp.\n\n"}
{"id": "30582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30582", "title": "The Sixth Sense", "text": "The Sixth Sense\n\nThe Sixth Sense is a 1999 American supernatural horror film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. The film tells the story of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a troubled, isolated boy who is able to see and talk to the dead, and an equally troubled child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) who tries to help him. The film established Shyamalan as a writer and director, and introduced the cinema public to his traits, most notably his affinity for surprise endings.\n\nReleased by Hollywood Pictures on August 6, 1999, the film was well-received by critics; praise was given to its acting performances (particularly Willis, Osment, and Toni Collette), atmosphere, and twist conclusion. \"The Sixth Sense\" was the second-highest-grossing film of 1999 (behind \"\"), taking about $293 million in the US and $379 million in other markets. This made it the highest-grossing horror film (in unadjusted dollars) until that time; it was surpassed by \"It\" in 2017.\n\nThe film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Shyamalan, Best Original Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor for Osment, and Best Supporting Actress for Collette.\n\nMalcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in Philadelphia, returns home one night with his wife, Anna, after having been honored for his work. Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. A young man then appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself.\n\nThe next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, nine-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother Lynn worries about his social skills, especially after seeing signs of physical harm. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead.\n\nAt first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, Vincent begins crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability. He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business. At first, Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him, but he finally decides to attempt helping.\n\nCole talks to one of the ghosts, a young girl named Kyra who recently died after a chronic illness. He goes with Crowe to her funeral reception at her home, where Kyra directs him to a box holding a videotape, which he then gives to her father. The tape shows Kyra's mother poisoning her daughter's food. By proving she was a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, Cole has saved Kyra's younger sister, the mother's next victim.\n\nLearning to live with the ghosts he sees, Cole begins to fit in at school and is cast as the lead in the school play, which Crowe attends. The doctor and patient depart on positive terms and Cole suggests to Crowe that he should try speaking to Anna while she is asleep. Later, while stuck in traffic, Cole confesses his secret to his mother, saying that someone died in an accident ahead of their traffic and he knows because the person is next to him. Although his mother at first does not believe him, Cole proves his ability to her by talking about how his grandmother visits him. He describes how his grandmother saw his mother in a dance performance, even though Lynn thought her mother was not there. He further relays the answer to a question his mother privately asked at her mother's grave: \"Every day.\" When Cole asks what question she asked, his mother tearfully answers, \"Do I make her proud?\" They hug.\n\nCrowe returns home, where he finds his wife asleep with their wedding video playing. While still asleep, Anna asks her husband why he left her, and drops Crowe's wedding ring. He remembers what Cole said about ghosts, notices how people have been ignoring him as if he wasn’t there, and remembers when Vincent shot him in the beginning of the film. Crowe finds the gunshot wound is still there and he is wearing the same clothes as when he was shot, revealing that he has actually been deceased the whole time due to his gunshot wound. Because of Cole's efforts, Crowe's unfinished business – rectifying his failure to understand and help Vincent – is finally complete. Crowe fulfills the second reason he returned: to tell his wife she was never second, and that he loves her. With his goals complete, his spirit exits through a light filled doorway.\n\n\nDavid Vogel, then-president of production of The Walt Disney Studios, read Shyamalan's spec script and instantly loved it. Without obtaining corporate approval, Vogel bought the rights to the script, despite the high price of $3 million and the stipulation that Shyamalan could direct the film. Disney later dismissed Vogel from his position at the studio, with Vogel leaving the company shortly thereafter. Disney—apparently in a show of little confidence in the film—sold the production rights to Spyglass Entertainment, while retaining the distribution rights and 12.5% of the film's box office receipt.\n\nThe color red is intentionally absent from most of the film, but it is used prominently in a few isolated shots for \"anything in the real world that has been tainted by the other world\" and \"to connote really explosively emotional moments and situations\". Examples include the door of the church where Cole seeks sanctuary; the balloon, carpet, and Cole's sweater at the birthday party; the tent in which he first encounters Kyra; the volume numbers on Crowe's tape recorder; the doorknob on the locked basement door where Malcolm's office is located; the shirt that Anna wears at the restaurant; Kyra's mother's dress at the wake; and the shawl wrapped around the sleeping Anna.\n\nAll of the clothes Malcolm wears during the film are items he wore or touched the evening before his death, which included his overcoat, his blue rowing sweatshirt and the different layers of his suit. Though the filmmakers were careful about clues of Malcolm's true state, the camera zooms slowly towards his face when Cole says, \"I see dead people.\" In a special feature, the filmmakers mention they initially feared this would be too much of a giveaway, but decided to leave it in.\n\nMarisa Tomei was considered for the role of Lynn Sear.\n\nThe film had a production budget of approximately $40 million (plus $25 million for prints and advertising). It grossed $26.6 million in its opening weekend and spent five weeks as the No. 1 film at the U.S. box office. It earned $293,506,292 in the United States and a worldwide gross of $672,806,292, ranking it 35th on the list of box-office money earners in the U.S. as of April 2010. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 57.5 million tickets in the US. In the United Kingdom, it was given at first a limited release at 9 screens, and entered at No. 8 before climbing up to No. 1 the next week with 430 theatres playing the film.\n\nAfter a 6-month online promotion campaign, \"The Sixth Sense\" was released on VHS and DVD by Hollywood Pictures Home Video on March 28, 2000. It would go on to become the top-selling DVD of 2000, with more than 2.5 million units shipped, as well as the top video rental title of all-time.\n\n\"The Sixth Sense\" received positive reviews; Osment in particular was widely praised for his performance. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 85% of 150 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review and an average rating of 7.6/10. The site's consensus reads: \"M. Night Shayamalan's \"The Sixth Sense\" is a twisty ghost story with all the style of a classical Hollywood picture, but all the chills of a modern horror flick.\" Metacritic rated it 64 out of 100 based on 35 reviews, meaning “generally favorable reviews”. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nBy vote of the members of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, \"The Sixth Sense\" was awarded the Nebula Award for Best Script during 1999. The film was No. 71 on Bravo's \"100 Scariest Movie Moments\", for the scene where Cole encounters a female ghost in his tent. It was named the 89th best American film of all time in a 2007 poll by the American Film Institute.\n\nThe line \"I see dead people\" from the film became a popular catchphrase after its release, scoring No. 44 on AFI's \"100 Years...100 Movie Quotes\". There have been various parodies of this quote.\n\n\"The Sixth Sense\" also scored 60th place on AFI's \"100 Years...100 Thrills\", honoring America's most \"heart pounding movies\".\n\n\"The Sixth Sense\" has received numerous awards and nominations, with Academy Award nomination categories ranging from those honoring the film itself (Best Picture), to its writing, editing, and direction (Best Director, Best Editing, and Best Original Screenplay), to its cast's performance (Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress). Especially lauded was the supporting role of actor Haley Joel Osment, whose nominations include an Academy Award, a Broadcast Film Critics Association Award, and a Golden Globe Award. Overall, \"The Sixth Sense\" was nominated for six Academy Awards and four British Academy Film Awards, but won none. The film received three nominations from the People's Choice Awards and won all of them, with lead actor Bruce Willis being honored for his role. The Satellite Awards nominated the film in four categories, with awards being received for writing (M. Night Shyamalan) and editing (Andrew Mondshein). Supporting actress Toni Collette was nominated for both an Academy Award and a Satellite award for her role in the film. James Newton Howard was honored by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers for his composition of the music for the film.\n\nIn 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked the screenplay #50 on its list of 101 Greatest Screenplays ever written.\n\n\n\n"}

He captures the Indian princess Zaida and tries to force her to marry him, but she is in love with a young man named Aranes. There is an offstage fight and Aranes is reported killed; meanwhile, De Sale, who has confided to the audience that he plots to overthrow Arviragus and make himself King, ingratiates himself with Zaida.\n\nDe Sale's fellow plotters are bumbling incompetents and their plans are easily thwarted, followed by a comic trial scene. It is revealed that Aranes is Arviragus' long lost son, whom he recognizes from a bracelet, and that he is still alive, his friend Alvarez having died in his place. The plotters are executed and Aranes and Zaida marry.\n\nThe play is more comedy than anything else. The pirates are mostly fools, in particular Sir Gaudy Tulip, an aged and cowardly London beau; the \"Gang-i-sawai\" is, for no reason other than comic effect, carrying two European ladies, Tulip's ex-mistress and another pirate's ex-wife, who exchange tart comments with the men; the drunken conspirators and outrageously partial court are played entirely for laughs.\n"}

The stories are written by Urbanus himself and drawn by Willy Linthout. The first story was published in 1982 and is still in syndication as of this day, being the longest-running and most successful Flemish comic strip based on a celebrity. The comics sell well in the Netherlands too, due to Urbanus' popularity there.\n\nIn the series Urbanus is portrayed as an eleven to twelve-year old version of himself, despite his full-grown beard. Just like the real Urbanus he lives in Tollembeek, but here end all similarities. Urbanus is portrayed as a bad young boy who frequently tries to trick the local villagers, his parents, his teacher, his fellow students and gets into trouble for it. The style of comedy is absurd, black and often vulgar. All animals in this comic strip are able to talk. Pop culture references to TV shows, comics, cartoons, films and Urbanus' own merchandise are frequently made. The authors deliberately use Flemish dialect instead of standard Dutch and also deliberately keep the drawing style naïve and simple, inspired by the series of Marc Sleen.\n\nThe albums are usually long adventure stories, but some are one-page gags as well.\n\nWilly Linthout drew the first \"Urbanus\" story in November 10, 1982, without interference of Urbanus himself. As the comedian felt Linthout didn't quite capture his style he became the series' permanent collaborator from the second album on. From December 16, 1982 until April 25, 1996 all albums were published by Uitgeverij Loempia, a publishing company created by Linthout and Jef Meert. Since 1996 Standaard Uitgeverij does the publishing.\n\nThe main characters are:\n\n\nIn 1992 a partial animated adaptation of the 18th \"Urbanus\" album \"Het Lustige Kapoentje\" was made in collaboration with 20th Century Fox.

They are made available on Urbanus' official site.\n\nIn 1997 Urbanus and Linthout made a crossover comic strip named \"Kiekebanus\", in which characters from their series meet characters from Merho's series \"De Kiekeboes\". In another De Kiekeboes album, \"Bij Fanny op Schoot\" (2005), Urbanus and his family were also guest stars.\n\nOn April 8, 2000 Urbanus, Amedee and Nabuko Donosor received their own statue in Tollembeek.

It is also known as the premiere platform for electronic dance music. The conference brings together professionals such as artists, DJs, record label representatives (A&R), producers, promoters, radio and the media for seminars and panel discussions. Thousands of attendees attend the WMC each year from around the world.\n\nIt was founded in 1985 by Louis Possenti and Bill Kelly. Held annually in Miami Beach, Fla., the Winter Music Conference, or \"WMC\" as followers of electronic dance music call it, has hosted up to an estimated 100,000 people. The first Winter Music Conference took place at the Fort Lauderdale Marriott during 19–21 Feb. 1986. There were approximately 80 dance music industry insiders in attendance. Since its inception in 1986, the event festivities have moved down south, across Miami Beach and Downtown Miami. \n\nA major event during WMC is the International Dance Music Awards (IDMAs). The IDMAs are an integral part of WMC generating over two million votes from music enthusiasts in 209 countries and territories every year to recognize and honor exceptional achievements in 57 award categories.\n\nThe event commands a major international draw with around 38 percent of attendees coming from outside the United States. The conference serves as a platform for many underground and indie artists from over 70 different countries who spend the conference at events and panels; it is also a medium used by several entrepreneurs and consumer electronic companies to present their businesses and technological developments.\n\nThe WMC & The Recording Academy began in 1996 - a partnership presenting The Producers Forum, a gathering of legendary artists. In 1999, \"Ultra Beach Music Festival\", now known as Ultra Music Festival, became an event as part of Winter Music Conference, taking place on 13 Mar. 1999. Waxpoetics Magazine, JBL, and Stanton sponsored the first International Record Collectors Show in 2007. The WMC 2009 introduced the first annual WMC VJ Challenge at The Miami Beach Resort & Spa with celebrity hosts, judges, and VJs from various parts of the world hosted by VJ Psyberpixie and Felix Sama. This inaugural year of the competition resulted in Sergey Lobodln (Moscow, Russia), walking away with the top winner prize. In 2010, the VJ Challenge was expanded into two areas of competition; Video Mixing and Audio/Visual Mixing. The 2010 VJ Challenge winners were AeonChild (Boulder, Colorado) in the video category and Eclectic Method (London/NYC) in the Audio/Visual category.\nThe Miami Beach Resort also received the performance of the RoboMusic Demo in which Funkstar De Luxe and RoboProfessor (Henrik Hautop Lund) create live interactive compositions of RoboMusic.\n\nSince 2008, the conference has received increasing competition from the International Music Summit taking place in Ibiza in May.\n\nIn 2011, for the first time, WMC and Ultra Music Festival split and took place during two completely separate weekends in March. This was \"a gross inconsideration by the WMC for event planners worldwide and artist scheduling.\" according to Windish Agency booking agent Steve Goodgold. 2014 was the last year that WMC lasted a total of ten days. In 2015, WMC took place across the span of five days. Following that, 2016 was the second time that Winter Music Conference took place apart from Ultra Music Festival, lasting only four days, 21–24 March. Since then, other music conferences have come about including SXSW in Austin, Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE), and EDMbiz in Las Vegas, which takes place during Electric Daisy Carnival yearly.\n\nOn Mar. 21, 2018, Ultra announced that it had acquired the WMC and the IDMAs. \n\nHundreds of industry professionals, producers, artists, promoters, record labels, and enthusiasts gather to network in various seminars, panels, workshops, parties, and DJ spinoff events. WMC is not only for the big artists, such as Tiesto and Steve Aoki but also for underground artists and DJ newbies. If you are a newbie and are asked to perform during WMC, you are being given the opportunity for thousands of attendees to listen to your music and to even possibly get scouted by a record label. \n\nThere are over 500 individual events during the week the conference takes place. In 2007, \"The New York Times\" named it \"one of the most anticipated clubbing events in the country.\"\n\n\n\n"}
