{"id": "360138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=360138", "title": "24 Hour Party People", "text": "24 Hour Party People\n\n24 Hour Party People is a 2002 British comedy-drama film about Manchester's popular music community from 1976 to 1992, and specifically about Factory Records. It was written by Frank Cottrell Boyce and directed by Michael Winterbottom. The film was entered into the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. It received positive reviews.\n\nIt begins with the punk rock era of the late 1970s and moves through the 1980s into the rave and DJ culture and the \"Madchester\" scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The main character is Tony Wilson (played by Steve Coogan), a news reporter for Granada Television and the head of Factory Records. The narrative largely follows his career, while also covering the careers of the major Factory artists, especially Joy Division and New Order, A Certain Ratio, The Durutti Column and Happy Mondays.\n\nThe film is a dramatisation based on a combination of real events, rumours, urban legends, and the imaginings of the scriptwriter – as the film makes clear. In one scene, one-time Buzzcocks member Howard Devoto (played by Martin Hancock) is shown having sex with Wilson's first wife in the toilets of a club; the real Devoto, an extra in the scene, turns to the camera and says, \"I definitely don't remember this happening.\" The fourth wall is frequently broken, with Wilson (who also acts as the narrator) frequently commenting on events directly to camera as they occur, at one point declaring that he is \"being postmodern, before it's fashionable\". The actors are often intercut with real contemporary concert footage, including the Sex Pistols gig at the Lesser Free Trade Hall.\n\nIn 1976 television presenter Tony Wilson sees the Sex Pistols perform at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall for the first time. Inspired, Wilson starts a weekly series of punk rock shows at a Manchester club, where the newly formed Joy Division perform, led by the erratic, brooding Ian Curtis.\n\nWilson founds a record label, Factory Records, and signs Joy Division as the first band; the contract is written in Wilson's blood and gives the Factory artists full control over their music. He hires irascible producer Martin Hannett to record Joy Division, and soon the band and label have a hit record. In 1980, just before Joy Division is to tour the United States, Curtis hangs himself. Joy Division rename themselves New Order and record a hit single, \"Blue Monday\".\n\nWilson opens a nightclub, The Haçienda; business is slow at first, but eventually the club is packed each night. Wilson signs another hit band, Happy Mondays, led by Shaun Ryder, and the ecstasy-fuelled rave culture is born.\n\nDespite the apparent success, Factory Records is losing money. Every copy of \"Blue Monday\" sold loses five pence, as the intricately designed packaging by Peter Saville costs more than the single's sale price. Wilson pays for New Order to record a new album in Ibiza, but after two years, they still have not delivered a record. He pays for the Happy Mondays to record their fourth studio album in Barbados, but Ryder spends all the recording money on drugs. When Wilson finally receives the finished album, he finds that Ryder has refused to record vocals, and all the tracks are instrumentals. At the Haçienda, ecstasy use is curbing alcohol sales and attracting gang violence.\n\nThe Factory partners try to save the business by selling the label to London Records but when Wilson reveals that the label does not hold binding contracts with any of its artists, the deal falls through. While smoking marijuana on the roof of Haçienda after its closing night, Wilson has a vision of God who assures Wilson he has earned a place in history.\n\nCameos\n\nThe film holds a Metacritic score of 85/100. Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars.\n\nThe film was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe soundtrack to \"24 Hour Party People\" features songs by artists closely associated with Factory Records who were depicted in the film. These include Happy Mondays, Joy Division (later to become New Order) and The Durutti Column. Manchester band the Buzzcocks are featured, as are The Clash. The album begins with \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" by the Sex Pistols, the band credited in the film with inspiring Factory Records co-founder Tony Wilson to devote himself to promoting music.\n\nNew tracks recorded for the album include Joy Division's \"New Dawn Fades\", from a concert performance by New Order with Moby and Billy Corgan.\n\n\nSeveral songs appear in the film but are not on the soundtrack album, including:\n\n\n"}

Painters, artists and craftsmen joined the Guild of Saint Luke, which educated apprentices and guaranteed quality.\n\nThe first school of artists that emerged in the city were the Antwerp Mannerists, a group of anonymous late Gothic painters active in the city from about 1500 to 1520. They were followed by Mannerist painters in the Italian tradition that developed at the end of the High Renaissance. Jan Gossaert was a major artist in the city at this time. Other artists, such as Frans Floris, continued this style.\n\nThe iconoclastic riots ('Beeldenstorm' in Dutch) of 1566 that preceded the Dutch Revolt resulted in the destruction of many works of religious art, after which time the churches and monasteries had to be refurnished and redecorated. Artists such as Otto van Veen and members of the Francken family, working in a late mannerist style, provided new religious decoration. It also marked a beginning of economic decline in the city, as the Scheldt river was blockaded by the Dutch Republic in 1585 diminishing trade.\n\nThe city experienced an artistic renewal in the 17th century. The large workshops of Peter Paul Rubens and Jacob Jordaens, and the influence of Anthony van Dyck, made Antwerp the center of the Flemish Baroque. The city was an internationally significant publishing centre, and had a huge production of old master prints and book illustrations. Antwerp \"animaliers\" or animal painters, such as Frans Snyders, Jan Fyt and Paul de Vos dominated this speciality in Europe for at least the first half of the century. Many artists joined the Guild of Romanists, a society for which having visited Rome was a condition of membership. But as the economy continued to decline, and the Habsburg Governors and the Church reduced their patronage, many artists trained in Antwerp left for the Netherlands, England, France or elsewhere, and by the end of the 17th century Antwerp was no longer a major centre for art.\n\nThe artistic legacy of Antwerp is represented in many museums, and paintings of the Antwerp School are valued at auctions.\n\n\n"}

It was created on April 24, 2000 by Arizona Senate Bill 1220. The mission of the AZSTA is to build and operate a multipurpose facility, to provide funding for tourism promotion in Maricopa County, to improve Cactus League spring training facilities, and to build community youth and amateur sports and recreational facilities.\n\nThe AZSTA Board of Directors consists of nine citizens of Maricopa Co. who volunteer their time and accept no compensation or per diem. The Board members are appointed to five-year terms by the Governor (5), the President of the Senate (2) and the Speaker of the House (2) and are eligible to serve two terms. Board appointees are appointed to achieve a balanced representation of the Valley's regions as well as the tourism industry, Cactus League and youth sports. The daily operation of the AZSTA is overseen by the Executive Staff Members.\n\nOn April 24, 2000 Arizona Governor Jane Dee Hull signed Arizona Senate Bill 1220 which created the Arizona Tourism and Sports Authority (initially known as the TSA). Later in April 2004 the \"Arizona Tourism and Sports Authority\" was renamed to the \"Arizona Sports and Tourism Authority\" in order to avoid confusion with the similarly abbreviated Transportation Security Administration.\n\nThe first order of business for the TSA was to bring a stadium financing package to voters in Maricopa County which took the form of Arizona Proposition 302. On November 7, 2000 voters approved the ballot initiative with a 52% to 48% vote.\n\nIn May 2001 the TSA approved its first youth sports project. In late September 2001 the TSA approved the City of Avondale’s youth sports complex proposal. The TSA hosted a Youth and Amateur Sports Town Hall in April 2002. During the Town Hall the TSA formed an advisory committee and announced plans to develop existing youth and amateur sports facilities. The Advisory Committee held its first meeting in May 2002. In December 2002 the TSA approved an intergovernmental agreement with the City of Avondale for a 10-field complex to be completed by December 2003. In February 2003 the TSA hosted the First Annual Youth and Amateur Sports Summit. In June 2003 the TSA broke ground for the Avondale Regional Youth Sports Complex. The Youth and Amateur Sports Committee provided the TSA with recommendations, and in February 2004 the TSA approved $1.32 million for 13 projects and programs.\n\nIn February 2002, AZSTA made its first spring training decision when it voted to increase the funding commitment for the City of Surprise spring training facility. In December 2002 the City of Surprise held the grand opening of \"Billy Parker Field\". In February 2003 AZSTA sold $33 million of Cactus League bonds and directed $4.3 million to a $6.4 million upgrade project for Phoenix Municipal Stadium. The $4.3 million was presented in a commemorative check on March 26, 2003 during an Oakland Athletics vs. Arizona Diamondbacks game. The Phoenix Municipal Stadium project was completed in February 2004.\n\nAZSTA has committed $68.3 million in funding for renovations to Cactus League facilities in Scottsdale, Tempe, Phoenix and Surprise. It is estimated that over 30 years, AZSTA will contribute $205 million to the refurbishment of Cactus League facilities in Maricopa County.\n\nAZSTA has funded:\n\n\nUpcoming Cactus League projects include a stadium in Goodyear for the Cleveland Indians and a stadium in Glendale for the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago White Sox.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7474594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7474594", "title": "Atelier", "text": "Atelier\n\nAn atelier () is the private workshop or studio of a professional artist in the fine or decorative arts, where a principal master and a number of assistants, students, and apprentices can work together producing pieces of fine art or visual art released under the master's name or supervision.\n\nThis was the standard vocational practice for European artists from the Middle Ages to the 19th century, and common elsewhere in the world. In medieval Europe such a way of working and form of visual or fine art education was often enforced by local guild regulations, of the painters' Guild of Saint Luke, and those of other guilds for other crafts. Apprentices usually began young, working on simple tasks, and after some years became journeymen, before becoming masters themselves. The system was gradually replaced as the once powerful guilds declined, and the academy became a favored method of training, although many professional artists continued to use students and assistants, some paid by the artist, some paying fees to learn.\n\nIn art, the atelier consists of a master artist, usually a professional painter, sculptor, or from the mid-19th century a fine art photographer, working with a small number of students to train them in visual or fine arts. This very word has also taken on other similar meanings, indicating a place of work and study of the haute couture fashion designer, hair stylist and artists in general. Atelier schools can be found around the world, particularly in North America and Western Europe.\n\nAlthough the methods vary, most painting ateliers train students in the skills and techniques associated with creating some form of representational art, the making of two-dimensional images that appear real to the viewer. They traditionally include sessions for drawing or painting nude art.\n\nSight-Size is a method of drawing and painting an object exactly as it appears to the artist, on a one-to-one scale. The artist first sets a vantage point where the subject and the drawing surface appear to be the same size. Then, using a variety of measuring tools—which can include levels, mirrors, plumb bobs, strings, and sticks—the artist draws the subject so that, when viewed from the set vantage point, the drawing and the subject have exactly the same dimensions. When properly done, sight-size drawing can result in extremely accurate and realistic drawings. It can also be used to draw the exact dimensions for a model in preparation for a painting.\n\nAteliers following the sight-size method generally agree that the practice of careful drawing is the basis of painting, teaching a form of realism based upon careful observations of nature with attention to detail. Using this method, students progress through a series of tasks such as cast drawing, cast painting, drawing and painting from the live model, and still life. Students must complete each task to the instructor's satisfaction before progressing to the next. This system is referred to as \"systematic progression\" or \"systematic teaching and learning\".\n\nAtelier students often begin this progression by drawing plaster casts. These casts are usually faces, hands, or other parts of the human anatomy. Plaster casts provide some of the benefits of live, human models, such as the presence of natural shadows. They also have their own distinct advantages: they remain perfectly still and their white color allows the student to focus on the pure, grayscale tones of shadows.\n\nOne goal for sight-size students is to gain enough skill to transfer an accurate image to the paper or canvas without the aid of a mechanical device. Contemporary realist painter Adrian Gottlieb notes that \"while professional painters pursuing a full-time career will develop an 'eye' that precludes the need for measuring devices and plumb lines (tools necessary during the training period), the observation method itself is not abandoned - instead it becomes second nature. Sight-size can be taught and applied in conjunction with a particular sensitivity to gesture to create life-like imagery; especially when applied to portraiture and figurative works.\"\n\nDarren R. Rousar, former student of Richard Lack and Charles Cecil as well as the author of \"Cast Drawing Using the Sight-Size Approach\", agrees and defines measuring in broad terms. He says that \"a fully trained artist who uses Sight-size might never use a plumb line or even consciously think about literal measuring. He or she will strive toward achieving the same retinal impression in the painting as is seen in nature.\"\n\nArt school owner Charles H. Cecil writes:\n\nArt from ateliers using the sight-size method is often reminiscent of Greek and Roman sculpture from classical antiquity, such as the Apollo Belvedere. Paintings may favor the visual imagery of the Neoclassical art of the mid-18th to 19th century. The sight-size method also lends itself to styles of portraiture in which the artists desires an accurate, natural, true to life or even near photographic image of the sitter as is evident in the work of Bouguereau.\n\nThe comparative measurement method requires proportional accuracy, but allows the artist to vary the size of the image created. This technique broadly encompasses any method of drawing that involves making accurate measurements primarily using the naked eye. In the early training period students may be aided by a pencil, brush or plumb line to make comparisons, but there is no transfer of 1:1 measurements from subject directly to paper. Schools that teach this method include The Water Street Atelier and The Swedish Academy of Realist Art.\n\nIn his essay, \"The Sight-size Method and its Disadvantages\", the painter and instructor Hans-Peter Szameit, of the Swedish Academy of Realist Art, discusses the disadvantages of sight-size, describing it as essentially the making of a mechanically produced image limited to one size, the \"sight size\".\n\nAnother traditional atelier method incorporates the use of illusions that fool the viewer into believing an image is accurate. This method is most often taught in conjunction with advanced compositional theory. Since it is not necessary to copy the subject accurately to achieve a successful illusion, this method allows the artist to experiment with many options while retaining what appears to be a realistic image.\n\nIn one example, the \"Study of a male figure, for Mercury descending\" (c. 1613–1614 (drawn), in \"The Education of Marie de' Medici\"), Rubens has obscured the point where the legs attach to the torso. This is one factor that contributes to the ease in which he is able to successfully experiment with a variety of dramatically different leg placements. At least three sets of feet are visible. The viewer is not disturbed by an illogical attachment if the attachment is not visible and the resulting two-dimensional image is pleasing to the eye. This allows the artist to choose from a great number of very different alternatives, making his selection based on personal preference or aesthetics rather than accuracy. In the referenced exercise it is possible to experiment with numerous manipulations regarding the size and placement of each part of the body while at the same time using a collection of two-dimensional foreshortening illusions to retain the appearance of realism.\n\nIn addition to body parts, artists may rely on the manipulation of many other elements to achieve a successful illusion. These can include: the manipulation of color, value, edge characteristics, overlapping shapes, and a number of different types of paint applications such as glazing and scumbling. Work developed this way would not begin with a drawing, but rather the placement of all relevant elements necessary for the success of the illusions as well as the composition as a whole.\n\nMany of the illusions designed to mimic reality also speed the painting process, allowing artists more time to design and complete complex large-scale works.\n\nIndividual students of this method study a diverse selection of old masters, although many begin their studies with the High Renaissance (1490s–1527), Mannerist (1520–1580), Baroque (1600–1725), and Impressionist (1870s–1880s) painters, including Leonardo da Vinci, Degas, Michelangelo, Raphael, Rubens, and Titian. However, because the emphasis is on creativity, it is often the design of the composition and the application and use of materials that is studied with less focus on reproducing a particular style or subject.\n\nStudents of these ateliers will therefore exhibit a wide range of personal styles and increasing amounts of creative experimentation. The result is a group whose art is highly individualized, with each student pursuing their own individual interests. There was great diversity at the atelier of Léon Bonnat (1846–1855). Julius Kaplan characterised Bonnat as \"a liberal teacher who stressed simplicity in art above high academic finish, as well as overall effect rather than detail.\"\n\nSome of Bonnat's more notable students include: Fred Barnard, Georges Braque, Gustave Caillebotte, Suzor-Coté, Raoul Dufy, Thomas Eakins, Aloysius O'Kelly, John Singer Sargent, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Marius Vasselon\n"}

The basilica contains the largest extant hall from antiquity (see List of ancient Greek and Roman roofs) and is ranked a World Heritage Site. The hall has a length of 67 m, a width of 26.05 m and a height of 33 m. It is designated as part of the Roman Monuments, Cathedral of St. Peter and Church of Our Lady in Trier UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThe Aula Palatina was built around AD 310 as a part of the palace complex. Originally it was not a free standing building, but had other smaller buildings (such as a forehall, a vestibule and some service buildings) attached to it. The Aula Palatina was equipped with a floor- and wall-heating system (hypocaust). \n\nDuring the Middle Ages, it was used as the residence for the bishop of Trier. For that, the apse was redesigned into living quarters and pinnacles were added to the top of its walls. In the 17th century, the archbishop Lothar von Metternich constructed his palace just next to the Aula Palatina and incorporated it into his palace doing some major redesign. Later, in the 19th century, Frederick William IV of Prussia ordered the building to be restored to its original Roman state, which was done under the supervision of the military architect Carl Schnitzler. In 1856, the Aula Palatina became a Protestant church. In 1944, the building burned due to an air raid of the allied forces during World War II. When it was repaired after the war, the historical inner decorations from the 19th century were not reconstructed, so that the brick walls are visible from the inside as well.\n\n\n\n"}

She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is chanted repeatedly. The Bloody Mary apparition may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend. Bloody Mary appearances are mostly \"witnessed\" in group participation play.\n\nHistorically, the ritual encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backward holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see a skull (or the face of the Grim Reaper) instead, indicating that they were going to die before they would have the chance to marry.\n\nIn the ritual of today, Bloody Mary allegedly appears to individuals or groups who ritualistically invoke her name in an act of catoptromancy. This is done by repeatedly chanting her name into a mirror placed in a dimly-lit or candle-lit room. In some traditions the name must be repeated thirteen times (or some other specified number of times). The Bloody Mary apparition allegedly appears as a corpse, witch or ghost, can be friendly or evil, and is sometimes \"seen\" covered in blood. The lore surrounding the ritual states that participants may endure the apparition screaming at them, cursing them, strangling them, stealing their soul, drinking their blood, or scratching their eyes out. Some variations of the ritual call Bloody Mary by a different name—\"Hell Mary\" and \"Mary Worth\" are popular examples. The modern legend of Hanako-san in Japan strongly parallels the Bloody Mary mythology.\n\nThe modern addition of taunting Bloody Mary regarding her baby indicates the legendary figure's conflation with the historic figure Queen Mary I, also known as \"Bloody Mary\", whose life was marked by a number of miscarriages or false pregnancies and is remembered for her violent religious reforms.\n\nStaring into a mirror in a dimly-lit room for a prolonged period can cause one to hallucinate. Facial features may appear to \"melt\", distort, disappear, and rotate, while other hallucinatory elements, such as animal or strange faces, may appear. Giovanni Caputo of the University of Urbino, writes that this phenomenon, which he calls the \"strange-face illusion\", is believed to be a consequence of a \"dissociative identity effect\", which causes the brain's facial-recognition system to misfire in a currently unidentified way. Other possible explanations for the phenomenon include illusions attributed, at least partially, to the perceptual effects of \"Troxler's fading\", and possibly self-hypnosis.\n\nThe legend of Bloody Mary has served as inspiration for a number of movies, television shows, and video games dealing with the supernatural.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "990322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=990322", "title": "Bolo universe", "text": "Bolo universe\n\nThe \"Bolo\" universe is a fictional universe based on a series of military science fiction books by author Keith Laumer. It primarily revolves around the eponymous \"Bolo\", a type of self-aware tank. They first appeared in the short story \"Combat Unit\" (1960), and have since been featured in science fiction novels and short story anthologies by him and others.\n\nThe story of the books takes place in various times from the near-future (2018, 2068), the mid-range future (27th up to 37th century) and even farther in one case (118th century). The overall plot features mostly military themes and includes space exploration, alien races and some advances in human society.\n\nMany Bolo stories are told from the point of the view of the Bolo itself, with its internal thoughts printed in italics throughout the text.\n\nOne theme in Bolo works is the portrayal of valiant, tragic, self-sacrificing heroes, such as Bolo \"Nike\" in the story \"Miles to Go\" (Weber 1995, in Bolos Book III). Another concept explored by stories such as \"Miles to Go\" is the use (and abuse) of safeguards to prevent artificial intelligence from hurting its creators. (see also Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics.)\n\nTheir overall programming involves large amounts of human military history, and often they draw conclusions from that information which puts them at odds with their commanders. Sometimes Bolos develop senses of honor and nobility that would bring their actions into conflict with orders given by their human superiors. One of the stories in Rogue Bolo chronicles the actions of Combat Unit CSR, who identifies an alien threat to humanity but is forced to go \"rogue\" in order to defeat it (possibly for dramatic effect, as it does not appear to be explained why the bolo did not simply inform its commanders of the threat).\n\nBolos as envisioned by Laumer in his future history military SF are described as autonomous armoured fighting vehicles of immense size. \nWhile the early versions are in the range of a few hundred tons, the \"Mark XXXIII\", a standard model appearing in the series, weighs 32,000 tons.\n\n\nWeapon systems described as part of early Bolo marks include mostly real world weaponry; the more futuristic settings of the novels describes them carrying advanced nuclear weapons. The main gun of a Bolo is usually a variant of the \"Hellbore\" system which is described in the Bolo story-universe as a long-range deuterium-initiated fusion pulse. \"Hellbores\" were meant as weapons for interstellar vessels, and the versions mounted on Bolos were modified to fit.\n\nSecondary weapons cover a wide field of weapon systems, as Bolos were supposed to address most combat situations, including land, sea and air battles, sometimes including space/orbit. While Bolo models generally opted for a \"balanced\" approach to offensive and defensive capabilities, there were often specialised variations on the base model, such as heavy siege units, scout units and ECM platforms. The additional weaponry thus includes but isn't restricted to: A high-speed auto-cannon which was recurringly referred to as \"Infinite Repeaters\" (the 'infinite' referring to the fact that the Bolo can create its own ammunition from metals found in the environment, thus not having an ammo count in the true sense of the word), firing systems such as a combination of Gatling guns with mortars similar to the 2S4 Tyulpan; VLS (also for launch of drones etc.); as well as tank guns or railguns similar to battleship secondary armament, which includes additional \"Hellbores\" of a smaller caliber. Projectiles include KEP projectiles, \"DSFSLRP\" (futuristic APFSDS), other missiles and anti-personnel flechettes. Bolos may carry different types of drones (UAVs, hover-UGVs, even satellites) for maintenance, reconnaissance (sometimes including spy satellites) and providing additional offense.\n\nThe armor of a Bolo unit is designed to withstand direct hits from all weapons, including in some of the stories nuclear weapons. The armor consists of composite materials that are named in the books as \"durachrome\", \"flintsteel\", \"duralloy\" and \"endurachrome\". Many models would also use ablative or ceramic tiles to provide additional protection against plasma weapons.\n\nBolos are also described as having reactive armor ( to stop penetrator missiles that could bore through their regular armor), and energy battlescreens; battlescreens convert an enemy weapon fire into energy which could then be redirected to the Bolo's own systems and weapons. Also, beginning with the Mark XXIII, internal disruptor fields were added to limit damage to vital systems from any attacks which did manage to penetrate the Bolo's outer defenses.\n\nEach unit is also equipped with passive and active sensors, as well as stealth and ECW capabilities. Later Marks were often also equipped with FTL comm.\n\nPower for weapons, battlescreens, and mobility is most often provided by one or more fission or fusion energy sources, in conjunction with high-capacity batteries which are used as secondary or emergency power supplies. A Bolo's command center can remain operational for decades or centuries after reactor fuel is exhausted. As a last resort, Bolos may detonate their reactors to destroy an enemy, or prevent their capture.\n\nEarly Bolo models are described as not self-aware artificial intelligences. Up to the Mark IX, they are only systems which automate the functioning of the vehicle under direct human command. Beginning with the Mark X, Bolos begin to use limited AI systems using pre-packaged battle plans which allows them to function relatively independently provided the situation on the battlefield falls within the parameters of its pre-loaded plan. If not, the human commander needs to directly intervene either selecting a new battle plan or taking over the functions of the Bolo personally. This system is further advanced beginning with the Mark XV-R which is given a basic AI core capable of choosing between various pre-loaded plans based upon actual battlefield conditions. However, what these earlier Bolos are not capable of doing is developing their own independent battle plans.\n\nBeginning with the Mark XX, Bolos are equipped with a \"psychotronic brain\" which gives them artificial intelligence. Analogous to human minds, psychotronic brains do turn insane when damaged, which requires their creators to restrict the awareness and initiative at all times except during battle. This is accomplished by separating main processing from personality. The two are integrated (enabling the Bolo to come into possession of its full faculties) only when battle preconditions are met, such as the approach of an enemy or the order of a human officer. In later models, added redundancy reduces the likelihood of insanity and the restriction is relaxed to enhance intelligence. As a final safeguard, Bolos are equipped with a \"Total Systems Override Program\" (nicknamed \"Omega Worm\") which erases the Bolo's software, rendering it brain-dead. This is triggered if a Bolo refuses an authorized order or if executed by a human operator.\n\nThe cognitive inhibitions are completely removed after a review of the combat performance, at the \"Battle of Santa Cruz\" (c. A.D. 3030), of experimental unit \"23/B-0075-NKE\" (\"Nike\"). \"Nike\"'s performance demonstrates the capabilities and reliability of fully autonomous psychotronics. \"Nike\" herself dies by \"Omega Worm\" as a result of refusing to obey an officer who is a traitor. This leads to a revision of the parameters for execution of \"Omega Worm\" in later model Bolos.\n\nBeginning with the Mark XXV models, Bolos become completely autonomous, capable of full self-direction in all situations. However, it is found that the intuitive capabilities of human commanders working in conjunction with intelligent Bolos increases the effectiveness of the units and so, with some exceptions, human commanders continue to be assigned to, fight with and if necessary, die with their Bolos. This partnership is further enhanced with the introduction of the Mark XXXII which pioneers a neural interface which allows the Bolo and its human commander to mentally merge human intuition and Bolo processing speed.\n\nMost later mark Bolos have several processing centers, the main core, the personality center, the damage control core (in later models) and the survival center. Some Bolos are given a secondary main core; however, this was not typical. Of these, the survival center is the most heavily protected. In the event of the destruction of the Bolo, the survival center is designed to protect the Bolo's core personality and programming for later retrieval and reactivation.\n\nEach Bolo contains several computer \"cores\" with different functions, each of which contains multiple fully functional duplicates in case of failure. If a Bolo's logic becomes dysfunctional enough, it regresses to the original \"Resartus protocol\", which is embedded in all self-aware models just for such a case.\n\nA key factor in Bolo psychotronic design is the need to address public and military concern over the potential catastrophe which could be unleashed in the event of a Bolo disobeying orders or being suborned. To mitigate this, a number of safeguards are included in the psychotronic design—specifically a focus on loyalty, honour and a strong sense of duty, as well as a restriction on the level of awareness and processing power made available to the Bolo outside of combat. These safeguards often combine with the prejudices of ranking officers to cause the unnecessary destruction of a Bolo during combat. With Bolos being able to survive for centuries, older Marks often end up scattered across the galaxy abandoned on old warfields or retrofitted for use in farming or heavy construction. On several occasions obsolete Bolos go rogue, causing significant destruction, loss of life and bad publicity for the \"Dinochrome Brigade\": as a result, a special unit was set up to find all such units and burn out their control centers.\n\nOn several occasions, Bolos have turned against their commanders during combat: in \"Bolo!\", a damaged Mark XXV (Unit LNC/Lance) loses its IFF capability, causing it to attack a fellow Bolo. Although it is revealed at the end that Unit LNC had received battle damage that almost destroyed his personality center causing it to lose the IFF capability. Similarly, a Mark XXXIII (Unit HCT/Hector) was subverted by an alien AI and turned into a prison guard in \"Bolo Rising\". Conversely, Bolos have occasionally refused to carry out illegal, treasonous, or dishonourable orders, such as Unit NKE (Nike) in \"The Triumphant\" or Unit SOL (Surplus On Loan) in \"The Road to Damascus\".\n\nBolos and their human commanders are assigned to an elite \"Concordiat\" unit called the \"Dinochrome Brigade\", which traces its lineage back to various units on Earth. Individual Bolos are generally identified by a three-letter prefix which is generally extrapolated into a given name—this name is generally used as the default access code for a new commander. Often, Bolos on garrison duty are described as older surplus or reserve units on loan, in which case their three-letter prefix is changed to \"SOL\".\nBolos are generally deployed in groups to provide fire support, though individual units are occasionally detached to perform garrison duty—later marks of Bolo are considered to be so capable that a single unit can be assigned to guard an entire planet, even during periods when a human commander is not available. When deployed by the Dinochrome Brigade for major combat operations, Bolos usually serve with \"Planetary Siege Regiments.\" Before the development of higher marks of Bolos, powerful enough to often allow a single Bolo to conduct major planetary operations without support, the regiments are only called \"siege regiments.\"\n\nLaumer included a history of the Bolo as an appendix to one of his books. The \"Mark I\" is described as conventional large (150 tonne) tank equipped with various servos and mechanical devices to reduce crew requirements. It is developed around the year 2000 by the fictional Bolo Division of General Motors.\n\nBy the 300-tonne Mark III it has AI allowing limited independent action and is powered by \"ionic\" batteries able to support combat-level activity for up to ten years and enabling operation even when fully submerged.\n\nThe AI increases until the incorporation of Psychotronic circuitry in the Mark XX leads to Bolos becoming self-aware and capable of fully independent operation. The Mark XXVI is described as capable of true independent strategic planning, while the final standardised Bolo, the 32,000-tonne Mark XXXIII is described as fully self-willed and able to operate indefinitely without external support.\n\nAs humanity spreads beyond Earth, Bolos are used to protect first \"the Empire\", and then the \"Concordiat of Man\". For millennia, each successive mark of Bolo proves to be the lynchpin of humanity's ground-based defenses, especially in the numerous and protracted wars against various aliens, most notably the \"Deng\" and the \"Melconians\" in the 30th century. Bolos are also used in smaller scale raids, skirmishes and internal conflicts between warring human parties.\n\nThe Mark XXXIII Bolo is the last standard Bolo built by the \"Concordiat\" prior to the \"Melconian\" destruction of Earth. Following the genocide of the \"Final War\" with the \"Melconians\", surviving Bolos are described as crucial in sheltering and protecting the few scattered remnants of humanity during the long slow process of rebuilding. A number of \"seed corn\" colonies survive the genocide policies carried out by both sides and go on to produce new models of Bolo: these are even larger in size, design and capabilities.\n\nBolos appear in these books by Keith Laumer and others:\n\n\n\n\nThe Bolo stories inspired the board game Ogre, whose creators originally intended to license the stories. For cost reasons this did not occur and a different background was invented for the game, with its titular tank deliberately being made self unaware in order to differentiate it. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "36681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36681", "title": "Brave New World", "text": "Brave New World\n\nBrave New World is a dystopian novel written in 1931 by English author Aldous Huxley, and published in 1932. Largely set in a futuristic World State of genetically modified citizens and an intelligence-based social hierarchy, the novel anticipates huge scientific developments in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation, and classical conditioning that are combined to make a utopian society that goes challenged only by a single outsider. Huxley followed this book with a reassessment in an essay, \"Brave New World Revisited\" (1958), and with \"Island\" (1962), his final novel.\n\nIn 1999, the Modern Library ranked \"Brave New World\" fifth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2003, Robert McCrum writing for \"The Observer\" included \"Brave New World\" chronologically at number 53 in \"the top 100 greatest novels of all time\", and the novel was listed at number 87 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.\n\n\"Brave New World\"&apos;s title derives from Miranda's speech in William Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\", Act V, Scene I:\nTranslations of the title often allude to similar expressions used in domestic works of literature: the French edition of the work is entitled \"Le Meilleur des mondes\" (\"The Best of All Worlds\"), an allusion to an expression used by the philosopher Gottfried Leibniz and satirised in \"Candide, Ou l'Optimisme\" by Voltaire (1759).\n\nHuxley wrote \"Brave New World\" while living in Sanary-sur-Mer, France, in the four months from May to August 1931. By this time, Huxley had already established himself as a writer and social satirist. He was a contributor to \"Vanity Fair\" and \"Vogue\" magazines, and had published a collection of his poetry (\"The Burning Wheel\", 1916) and four successful satirical novels: \"Crome Yellow\" (1921), \"Antic Hay\" (1923), \"Those Barren Leaves\" (1925), and \"Point Counter Point\" (1928). \"Brave New World\" was Huxley's fifth novel and first dystopian work.\n\nHuxley said that \"Brave New World\" was inspired by the utopian novels of H. G. Wells, including \"A Modern Utopia\" (1905), and \"Men Like Gods\" (1923). Wells's hopeful vision of the future's possibilities gave Huxley the idea to begin writing a parody of the novels, which became \"Brave New World\". He wrote in a letter to Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith, an American acquaintance, that he had \"been having a little fun pulling the leg of H. G. Wells\", but then he \"got caught up in the excitement of [his] own ideas.\" Unlike the most popular optimist utopian novels of the time, Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future. Huxley referred to \"Brave New World\" as a \"negative utopia\", somewhat influenced by Wells's own \"The Sleeper Awakes\" (dealing with subjects like corporate tyranny and behavioural conditioning) and the works of D. H. Lawrence.\n\nGeorge Orwell believed that \"Brave New World\" must have been partly derived from the 1921 novel \"We\" by Yevgeny Zamyatin. However, in a 1962 letter to Christopher Collins, Huxley says that he wrote \"Brave New World\" long before he had heard of \"We\". According to \"We\" translator Natasha Randall, Orwell believed that Huxley was lying. The scientific futurism in \"Brave New World\" is believed to be cribbed from \"Daedalus\" by J. B. S. Haldane.\n\nThe events of the Depression in Britain in 1931, with its mass unemployment and the abandonment of the gold currency standard, persuaded Huxley to assert that stability was the \"primal and ultimate need\" if civilisation was to survive the present crisis. The \"Brave New World\" character Mustapha Mond, Resident World Controller of Western Europe, is named after Sir Alfred Mond. Shortly before writing the novel, Huxley visited Mond's technologically advanced plant near Billingham, north east England, and it made a great impression on him.\n\nHuxley used the setting and characters in his science fiction novel to express widely held opinions, particularly the fear of losing individual identity in the fast-paced world of the future. An early trip to the United States gave \"Brave New World\" much of its character. Not only was Huxley outraged by the culture of youth, commercial cheeriness and sexual promiscuity, and the inward-looking nature of many Americans, he had also found the book \"My Life and Work\" by Henry Ford on the boat to America, and he saw the book's principles applied in everything he encountered after leaving San Francisco.\n\nThe novel opens in the World State city of London in AF (After Ford) 632 (AD 2540 in the Gregorian calendar), where citizens are engineered through artificial wombs and childhood indoctrination programmes into predetermined classes (or castes) based on intelligence and labour. Lenina Crowne, a hatchery worker, is popular and sexually desirable, but Bernard Marx, a psychologist, is not. He is shorter in stature than the average member of his high caste, which gives him an inferiority complex. His work with sleep-learning allows him to understand, and disapprove of, his society's methods of keeping its citizens peaceful, which includes their constant consumption of a soothing, happiness-producing drug called \"soma\". Courting disaster, Bernard is vocal and arrogant about his criticisms, and his boss contemplates exiling him to Iceland because of his nonconformity. His only friend is Helmholtz Watson, a gifted writer who finds it difficult to use his talents creatively in their pain-free society.\n\nBernard takes a holiday with Lenina outside the World State to a Savage Reservation in New Mexico, in which the two observe natural-born people, disease, the aging process, other languages, and religious lifestyles for the first time. (The culture of the village folk resembles the contemporary Native American groups of the region, descendants of the Anasazi, including the Puebloan peoples of Acoma, Laguna and Zuni.) Bernard and Lenina witness a violent public ritual and then encounter Linda, a woman originally from the World State who is living on the reservation with her son John, now a young man. She, too, visited the reservation on a holiday many years ago, but became separated from her group and was left behind. She had meanwhile become pregnant by a fellow-holidaymaker (who is revealed to be Bernard's boss, the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning). She did not try to return to the World State, because of her shame at her pregnancy. Despite spending his whole life in the reservation, John has never been accepted by the villagers, and his and Linda's lives have been hard and unpleasant. Linda has taught John to read, although from the only two books in her possession — a scientific manual and the complete works of Shakespeare. Ostracised by the villagers, John is able to articulate his feelings only in terms of Shakespearean drama, especially the tragedies of \"Othello\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Hamlet\". Linda now wants to return to London, and John, too, wants to see this \"brave new world\". Bernard sees an opportunity to thwart plans to exile him, and gets permission to take Linda and John back. On their return to London, John meets the Director and calls him his \"father\", a vulgarity which causes a roar of laughter. The humiliated Director resigns in shame before he can follow through with exiling Bernard.\n\nBernard, as \"custodian\" of the \"savage\" John who is now treated as a celebrity, is fawned on by the highest members of society and revels in attention he once scorned. Bernard's popularity is fleeting, though, and he becomes envious that John only really bonds with the literary-minded Helmholtz. Considered hideous and friendless, Linda spends all her time using \"soma\", while John refuses to attend social events organised by Bernard, appalled by what he perceives to be an empty society. Lenina and John are physically attracted to each other, but John's view of courtship and romance, based on Shakespeare's writings, is utterly incompatible with Lenina's freewheeling attitude to sex. She tries to seduce him, but he attacks her, before suddenly being informed that his mother is on her deathbed. He rushes to Linda's bedside, causing a scandal, as this is not the \"correct\" attitude to death. Some children who enter the ward for \"death-conditioning\" come across as disrespectful to John until he attacks one physically. He then tries to break up a distribution of \"soma\" to a lower-caste group, telling them that he is freeing them. Helmholtz and Bernard rush in to stop the ensuing riot, which the police quell by spraying \"soma\" vapor into the crowd.\n\nBernard, Helmholtz, and John are all brought before Mustapha Mond, the \"Resident World Controller for Western Europe\", who tells Bernard and Helmholtz that they are to be exiled to islands for antisocial activity. Bernard pleads for a second chance, but Helmholtz welcomes the opportunity to be a true individual, and chooses the Falkland Islands as his destination, believing that their bad weather will inspire his writing. Mond tells Bernard that exile is actually a reward. The islands are full of the most interesting people in the world, individuals who did not fit into the social model of the World State. Mond outlines for John the events that led to the present society and his arguments for a caste system and social control. John rejects Mond's arguments, and Mond sums up John's views by claiming that John demands \"the right to be unhappy\". John asks if he may go to the islands as well, but Mond refuses, saying he wishes to see what happens to John next.\n\nJaded with his new life, John moves to an abandoned hilltop tower, near the village of Puttenham, where he intends to adopt a solitary ascetic lifestyle in order to purify himself of civilization, practising self-flagellation. This soon draws reporters and eventually hundreds of amazed sightseers, hoping to witness his bizarre behaviour; one of them is implied to be Lenina. At the sight of the woman he both adores and loathes, John attacks her with his whip. The onlookers are wildly aroused by the display and John is caught up in the crowd's \"soma\"-fueled frenzy. The next morning, he remembers the previous night's events and is stricken with remorse. Onlookers and journalists who arrive that evening discover John dead, having hanged himself.\n\nBernard Marx – a sleep-learning specialist at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. Although Bernard is an Alpha-Plus (the upper class of the society), he is a misfit. He is unusually short for an Alpha; an alleged accident with alcohol in Bernard's blood-surrogate before his decanting has left him slightly stunted. Bernard's independence of mind stems more from his inferiority complex and depressive nature than from any depth of philosophical conviction. Unlike his fellow utopians, Bernard is often angry, resentful, and jealous. At times, he is also cowardly and hypocritical. His conditioning is clearly incomplete. He doesn't enjoy communal sports, solidarity services, or promiscuous sex. He doesn't even get much joy out of \"soma\". Bernard is in love with Lenina but he doesn't like her sleeping with other men, even though \"everyone belongs to everyone else\". Bernard's triumphant return to utopian civilisation with John the Savage from the Reservation precipitates the downfall of the Director, who had been planning to exile him. Bernard's triumph is short-lived. Success goes to his head. Despite his tearful pleas, he is ultimately banished to an island for his non-conformist behaviour.\n\nJohn – the illicit son of the Director and Linda, born and reared on the Savage Reservation (\"Malpais\") after Linda was unwittingly left behind by her errant lover. John (\"the Savage\", as he is often called) is an outsider both on the Reservation—where the natives still practice marriage, natural birth, family life and religion—and the ostensibly civilised World State, based on principles of stability and shallow happiness. He has read nothing but the complete works of William Shakespeare, which he quotes extensively, and, for the most part, aptly, though his allusion to the \"Brave New World\" (Miranda's words in \"The Tempest\") takes on a darker and bitterly ironic resonance as the novel unfolds. John is intensely moral according to a code that he has been taught by Shakespeare and life in Malpais but is also naïve: his views are as imported into his own consciousness as are the hypnopedic messages of World State citizens. The admonishments of the men of Malpais taught him to regard his mother as a whore; but he cannot grasp that these were the same men who continually sought her out despite their supposedly sacred pledges of monogamy. Because he is unwanted in Malpais, he accepts the invitation to travel back to London and is initially astonished by the comforts of the World State. However, he remains committed to values that exist only in his poetry. He first spurns Lenina for failing to live up to his Shakespearean ideal and then the entire utopian society: he asserts that its technological wonders and consumerism are poor substitutes for individual freedom, human dignity and personal integrity. After his mother's death, he becomes deeply distressed with grief, surprising onlookers in the hospital. He then ostracizes himself from society and attempts to purify himself of \"sin\" (desire), but is finally unable to do so and hangs himself in despair.\n\nHelmholtz Watson – a handsome and successful Alpha-Plus lecturer at the College of Emotional Engineering and a friend of Bernard. He feels unfulfilled writing endless propaganda doggerel, and the stifling conformism and philistinism of the World State make him restive. Helmholtz is ultimately exiled to the Falkland Islands—a cold asylum for disaffected Alpha-Plus non-conformists—after reading a heretical poem to his students on the virtues of solitude and helping John destroy some Deltas' rations of \"soma\" following Linda's death. Unlike Bernard, he takes his exile in his stride and comes to view it as an opportunity for inspiration in his writing.\n\nLenina Crowne – a young, beautiful fetus technician at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. She is part of the 30% of the female population that are not freemartins (sterile women). Lenina is promiscuous and popular but somewhat quirky in her society: she had a four-month relation with Henry Foster, choosing not to have sex with anyone but him for a period of time. She is basically happy and well-conditioned, using \"soma\" to suppress unwelcome emotions, as is expected. Lenina has a date with Bernard, to whom she feels ambivalently attracted, and she goes to the Reservation with him. On returning to civilization, she tries and fails to seduce John the Savage. John loves and desires Lenina but he is repelled by her forwardness and the prospect of pre-marital sex, rejecting her as an \"impudent strumpet\". Lenina visits John at the lighthouse but he attacks her with a whip, unwittingly inciting onlookers to do the same. Her exact fate is left unspecified.\n\nMustapha Mond – Resident World Controller of Western Europe, \"His Fordship\" Mustapha Mond presides over one of the ten zones of the World State, the global government set up after the cataclysmic Nine Years' War and great Economic Collapse. Sophisticated and good-natured, Mond is an urbane and hyperintelligent advocate of the World State and its ethos of \"Community, Identity, Stability\". Among the novel's characters, he is uniquely aware of the precise nature of the society he oversees and what it has given up to accomplish its gains. Mond argues that art, literature, and scientific freedom must be sacrificed to secure the ultimate utilitarian goal of maximising societal happiness. He defends the genetic caste system, behavioural conditioning, and the lack of personal freedom in the World State: these, he says, are a price worth paying for achieving social stability, the highest social virtue because it leads to lasting happiness.\n\nFanny Crowne – Lenina Crowne's friend (they have the same last name because only ten thousand last names are in use in the World State). Fanny voices the conventional values of her caste and society, particularly the importance of promiscuity: she advises Lenina that she should have more than one man in her life because it is unseemly to concentrate on just one. Fanny then, however, warns Lenina away from a new lover whom she considers undeserving, yet she is ultimately supportive of the young woman's attraction to the savage John.\n\nHenry Foster – One of Lenina's many lovers, he is a perfectly conventional Alpha male, casually discussing Lenina's body with his coworkers. His success with Lenina, and his casual attitude about it, infuriate the jealous Bernard. Henry ultimately proves himself every bit the ideal World State citizen, finding no courage to defend Lenina from John's assaults despite having maintained an uncommonly longstanding sexual relationship with her.\n\nBenito Hoover – Another of Lenina's lovers. She remembers that he is particularly hairy when he takes his clothes off.\n\nThe Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning (DHC), also known as Thomas \"Tomakin\" – He is the administrator of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, where he is a threatening figure who intends to exile Bernard to Iceland. His plans take an unexpected turn, however, when Bernard returns from the Reservation with Linda (see below) and John, a child they both realize is actually his. This fact, scandalous and obscene in the World State not because it was extramarital (which all sexual acts are) but because it was procreative, leads the Director to resign his post in shame.\n\nLinda – John's mother, decanted as a Beta-Minus in the World State, originally worked in the DHC's Fertilizing Room, and subsequently lost during a storm while visiting the New Mexico Savage Reservation with the Director many years before the events of the novel. Despite following her usual precautions, Linda became pregnant with the Director's son during their time together and was therefore unable to return to the World State by the time that she found her way to Malpais. Having been conditioned to the promiscuous social norms of the World State, Linda finds herself at once popular with every man in the pueblo (because she is open to all sexual advances) and also reviled for the same reason, seen as a whore by the wives of the men who visit her and by the men themselves (who come to her nonetheless). Her only comforts there are \"mescal\" brought by Popé as well as \"peyotl\". Linda is desperate to return to the World State and to \"soma\", wanting nothing more from her remaining life than comfort until death.\n\nThe Arch-Community-Songster – The secular equivalent of the Archbishop of Canterbury in the World State society.\n\nThe Warden – An Alpha-Minus, the talkative chief administrator for the New Mexico Savage Reservation. He is blond, short, broad-shouldered, and has a booming voice.\n\nDarwin Bonaparte – a \"big game photographer\" (i.e. filmmaker) who films John flogging himself. Darwin Bonaparte is known for two other works: \"feely of the gorillas' wedding\", and \"Sperm Whale's Love-life\". He has already made a name for himself but still seeks more. He renews his fame by filming the savage, John, in his newest release \"The Savage of Surrey\". His name alludes to Charles Darwin and Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\n\n\nThese are non-fictional and factual characters who lived before the events in this book, but are of note in the novel:\n\nThe limited number of names that the World State assigned to its bottle-grown citizens can be traced to political and cultural figures who contributed to the bureaucratic, economic, and technological systems of Huxley's age, and presumably those systems in \"Brave New World\".\n\nUpon publication, Rebecca West praised \"Brave New World\" as \"The most accomplished novel Huxley has yet written\", Joseph Needham lauded it as \"Mr. Huxley's remarkable book\", and Bertrand Russell also praised it, stating, \"Mr. Aldous Huxley has shown his usual masterly skill in \"Brave New World.\"\"\n\nHowever, \"Brave New World\" also received negative responses from other contemporary critics, although his work was later embraced.\n\nIn an article in the 4 May 1935 issue of the \"Illustrated London News\", G. K. Chesterton explained that Huxley was revolting against the \"Age of Utopias\". Much of the discourse on man's future before 1914 was based on the thesis that humanity would solve all economic and social issues. In the decade following the war the discourse shifted to an examination of the causes of the catastrophe. The works of H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw on the promises of socialism and a World State were then viewed as the ideas of naive optimists. Chesterton wrote:\n\nSimilarly, in 1944 economist Ludwig von Mises described \"Brave New World\" as a satire of utopian predictions of socialism: \"Aldous Huxley was even courageous enough to make socialism's dreamed paradise the target of his sardonic irony.\"\n\nIn 1999, the Modern Library ranked \"Brave New World\" fifth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2003, Robert McCrum writing for \"The Observer\" included \"Brave New World\" chronologically at number 53 in \"the top 100 greatest novels of all time\", and the novel was listed at number 87 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.\n\nThe World State is built upon the principles of Henry Ford's assembly line: mass production, homogeneity, predictability, and consumption of disposable consumer goods. While the World State lacks any supernatural-based religions, Ford himself is revered as the creator of their society but not as a deity, and characters celebrate Ford Day and swear oaths by his name (e.g., \"By Ford!\"). In this sense, some fragments of traditional religion are present, such as Christian crosses, which had their tops cut off to be changed to a \"T\". In England, there is an Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury, obviously continuing the Archbishop of Canterbury, and in America the \"Christian Science Monitor\" continues publication as \"The Fordian Science Monitor\". The World State calendar numbers years in the \"AF\" era — \"Anno Ford\" — with the calendar beginning in AD 1908, the year in which Ford's first Model T rolled off his assembly line. The novel's Gregorian calendar year is AD 2540, but it is referred to in the book as AF 632.\n\nFrom birth, members of every class are indoctrinated by recorded voices repeating slogans while they sleep (called \"hypnopædia\" in the book) to believe their own class is superior, but that the other classes perform needed functions. Any residual unhappiness is resolved by an antidepressant and hallucinogenic drug called \"soma.\"\n\nThe biological techniques used to control the populace in \"Brave New World\" do not include genetic engineering; Huxley wrote the book before the structure of DNA was known. However, Gregor Mendel's work with inheritance patterns in peas had been rediscovered in 1900 and the eugenics movement, based on artificial selection, was well established. Huxley's family included a number of prominent biologists including Thomas Huxley, half-brother and Nobel Laureate Andrew Huxley, and his brother Julian Huxley who was a biologist and involved in the eugenics movement. Nonetheless, Huxley emphasises conditioning over breeding (nurture versus nature); human embryos and fetuses are conditioned through a carefully designed regimen of chemical (such as exposure to hormones and toxins), thermal (exposure to intense heat or cold, as one's future career would dictate), and other environmental stimuli, although there is an element of selective breeding as well.\n\nSocial critic Neil Postman contrasted the worlds of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" and \"Brave New World\" in the foreword of his 1985 book \"Amusing Ourselves to Death\". He writes:\nJournalist Christopher Hitchens, who himself published several articles on Huxley and a book on Orwell, noted the difference between the two texts in the introduction to his 1999 article \"Why Americans Are Not Taught History\":\n\nBrave New World Revisited (Harper & Brothers, US, 1958; Chatto & Windus, UK, 1959), written by Huxley almost thirty years after \"Brave New World\", is a non-fiction work in which Huxley considered whether the world had moved toward or away from his vision of the future from the 1930s. He believed when he wrote the original novel that it was a reasonable guess as to where the world might go in the future. In \"Brave New World Revisited\", he concluded that the world was becoming like \"Brave New World\" much faster than he originally thought.\n\nHuxley analysed the causes of this, such as overpopulation, as well as all the means by which populations can be controlled. He was particularly interested in the effects of drugs and subliminal suggestion. \"Brave New World Revisited\" is different in tone because of Huxley's evolving thought, as well as his conversion to Hindu Vedanta in the interim between the two books.\n\nThe last chapter of the book aims to propose action which could be taken to prevent a democracy from turning into the totalitarian world described in \"Brave New World\". In Huxley's last novel, \"Island\", he again expounds similar ideas to describe a utopian nation, which is generally known as a counterpart to his most famous work.\n\nThe American Library Association ranks \"Brave New World\" as No. 52 on their list of most challenged books.\n\nThe following list includes some notable incidents in which it has been censored, banned, or challenged:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2009, Ridley Scott and Leonardo DiCaprio announced that they would collaborate on a new adaptation of the book. However, , the project has been on hold while Scott has been involved with other projects.\n\nIn May 2015, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported that Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment will bring \"Brave New World\" to the SyFy TV channel as a scripted series, written (adapted) by Les Bohem.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "52734786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52734786", "title": "Canadian values", "text": "Canadian values\n\nCanadian values are the commonly shared ethical and human values of Canadians. The major political parties have claimed explicitly that they uphold these values, but use generalities to specify them. Justin Trudeau after taking office as Prime Minister in 2015 tried to define what it means to be Canadian, saying that Canada lacks a core identity but does have shared values:\n\nNumerous scholars have tried to identify, measure and compare them with other countries. Baer et al. argue that, \"Questions of national character and regional culture have long been of interest to both Canadian and American social scientists. The Canadian literature has focussed largely on historical and structural reasons for regional distinctiveness and the possible role of regionalism in undermining a truly national Canadian character or ethos.\" However, there are also critics who say that such a task is practically impossible.\n\nWhen he began his study of Canada in the late 1940s, American sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset assumed Canadian and American values were practically identical. Further work led him to discover and to explore the differences. By 1968 he concluded:\n\nLipset offered some theories of where the two societies differ, and why. That stimulated a large body of scholarship, with other scholars offering their own explanations and criticizing his. As a result, numerous academic studies compare Canadian values and beliefs with those of the United States, and sometimes they add in other countries as well. Lipset has explained his social science methodology:\n\nLipset presented numerous political and economic values on which he scored the U.S. as high and Canada as low. These included: individualism and competitiveness, entrepreneurship and high risk-taking, utopian moralism, inclination to political crusades, populist or anti-establishment and anti-elite tendencies, a God-and-country nationalism, and intolerance for ideological nonconformity.\n\nLipset argues that:\nCanadian historian Arthur R. M. Lower argues:\n\nReligious belief and behavior are possible candidates in searching for the sources of values. Lipset looked to religion as one of the causes of differentiation compared to the United States. He stated:\n\nHoover and Reimer agree and update Lipset with a plethora of recent survey statistics, while noting that the differences narrowed since 1990, especially in the Prairie provinces. They stress that in the early 21st century 87% of Canadians belonged to cooperative churches, whereas 20% of Americans were Baptists and many more were evangelicals, fundamentalists or members of new religions who tended to behave in a more sectarian fashion; these elements, they argue, made for a higher level of religious and political conservatism and intolerance in the U.S.\n\nBaer, Grabb and Johnston argue that:\n\nA 2013 Statistics Canada survey found that an \"overwhelming majority\" of Canadians shared the values of human rights (with 92% of respondents agreeing that they are a shared Canadian value), respect for the law (92%) and gender equality (91%). There was considerably less agreement among Canadians over whether ethnic and cultural diversity, linguistic duality, and respect for aboriginal culture were also shared Canadian values.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Index of Well Being at the University of Waterloo, Canadian values include:\n\nA survey for Citizen's Forum on Canada's Future, 1991 identified the following values:\n\n\nMichael Ignatieff, the Liberal leader in 2009-11, in 2004 rooted Canadian values in a historic loyalty to the Crown. Likewise the Conservative Party in 2009 pointed to support for the monarchy as a core Canadian value.\n\nJohn Diefenbaker, the Conservative Prime Minister 1957-63, was reluctant to use Canadian values as a criterion for deciding on foreign policies. For example, Jason Zorbas argues that human rights abuses in Argentina and Brazil did not affect relations with those countries.\n\nHowever his successor, Lester Pearson, the Liberal Prime Minister (1963–68), called in 1967 for a foreign policy \"based on Canadian considerations, Canadian values and Canadian interests.\"\n\nUnder Conservative Brian Mulroney, Prime Minister 1984 to 1993, according to scholar Edward Akuffo:\n\nJean Chrétien, the Liberal Prime Minister (1993-2003), showed little interest in foreign policy. Political scientists Patrick James, Nelson Michaud and Marc J. O'Reilly argue that, \"This plain-speaking politician built his career on defending traditional Canadian values and promoting middle-class policies.\"\n\nWhile Liberal and Conservative politicians claimed to represent Canadian values, so too did socialists and forces on the left. Ian MacKay argues that, thanks to the long-term political impact of \"Rebels, Reds, and Radicals\", and allied leftist political elements, \"egalitarianism, social equality, and peace... are now often simply referred to...as 'Canadian values.'\"\n\nHistoric educational ideals in Canada, contrasted to the United States, have been more elitist, with an emphasis on training church and political elites along British lines. In 1960, for example, 9.2 percent of Canadians aged 20 to 24 were enrolled in higher education, compared to 30.2 percent in the United States. Even at the secondary level, enrollments were higher in the United States. According to surveys in the late 1950s of citizens and educators by Lawrence Downey:\n\nThe United States has long emphasized vocational, technical and professional education, while the Canadian schools resist their inclusion. Ivor F. Goodson and Ian R. Dowbiggin have explored the battle over vocational education in London, Ontario, in the 1900-1930 era, a time when American cities were rapidly expanding their vocational offerings. The London Technical and Commercial High School came under heavy attack from the city's social and business elite, which saw the school as a threat to the budget of the city's only academic high school, London Collegiate Institute.\n\nMost post-secondary institutions in Canada are public universities which means they are funded by the provincial government, but they are not owned by the provinces. In contrast, public universities in the United States are owned and controlled by state governments, and there are many private universities, including such schools as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Chicago and Stanford.\n\nThe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, heavily promoted by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was adopted in 1982. The Charter guarantees certain political rights to Canadian citizens and civil rights of everyone in Canada from the policies and actions of all areas and levels of the government. It is designed to unify Canadians around a set of principles that embody those rights. Even before he entered politics, Trudeau had developed his concept of the charter primarily as an expression of common Canadian values. Trudeau said that thanks to the Charter, Canada itself could now be defined:\n\nThe enormous ethnic variety of the population of Canada in recent decades has led to an emphasis on \"multiculturalism.\" Sociologist N. M. Sussman says, \"The tenets of this concept permitted and subtly encouraged the private maintenance of ethnic values while simultaneously insisting on minimal public adherence to Canadian behaviors and to Canadian values.\" As result, immigrants to Canada are more likely to maintain the values and attitudes of both the home and of the host culture, compared to similar immigrants to Australia, the United Kingdom, or the United States.\n\nAndrew Griffith argues that, \"89 percent of Canadians believe that foreign-born Canadians are just as likely to be good citizens as those born in Canada...But Canadians clearly view multiculturalism in an integrative sense, with an expectation that new arrivals will adopt Canadian values and attitudes.\" Griffith adds that, \"There are virtually no differences between Canadian-born and foreign-born with respect to agreement to abide by Canadian values (70 and 68 percent, respectively).\"\n\nIn 2016, the workforce participation rate for Canadian women was 70.2% (78.4% for males).\n\nSome believe that Elsie MacGill defined Canadian values. She was a pioneer for women in engineering and business, a war hero and a role model.\n\nSection 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex.\n\nIn contrast, in the United States the Equal Rights Amendment was never ratified. Section 1 of that amendment would have granted \"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\"\n\nCiting Canadian values, Canadian courts have rejected assertions that violence against women is in some circumstances acceptable because of one's religious and cultural beliefs. In the \"R v. Humaid\" decision, Justice Rutherford of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice stated:\n\nUniversal access to publicly funded health services \"is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national health care insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country.\" Survey research in the 1990s showed that:\n\nCertain cultural practices were called \"Barbaric\" and made illegal in 2015, when the \"Zero Tolerance for Barbaric Cultural Practices Act\" was enacted by the Canadian federal government.\n\nIn the 2015 general election Conservatives pitched their policy \"as an issue of Canadian values...The Conservatives expanded the issue, announcing a proposed RCMP hotline that would allow Canadians to report the existence of 'barbaric cultural practices' in the country.\" These targeted practices included polygamy, forced marriage and early marriage (i.e. child marriage).\n\nThe 2015 act criminalizes certain conduct related to early and forced marriage ceremonies, including the act of removing a child from Canada for the purpose of such marriages.\n\nThe Memorial to the Victims of Communism – Canada, a Land of Refuge is located in Ottawa. It is being constructed to bring the suffering of \"the millions of victims Communism\" into the public's consciousness. Many of the victims fled to Canada \"seeking peace, order, democracy, and liberty.\" The memorial is expected to be completed in 2018.\n\nAccording to Ms. Mélanie Joly, the Minister of Canadian Heritage, \"Commemorative monuments play a key role in reflecting the character, identity, history and values of Canadians\". She complained that the previous Harper government had made the project too controversial. Her new Liberal government has moved the site and cut its budget.\n\nCanadian politicians have proposed rejecting immigrants who have anti-Canadian values such as:\n\nKellie Leitch, a candidate for leadership candidate for the Conservative Party of Canada, is among the proponents of this type of screening.\n\nIn 2016, an Environics public opinion poll found that 54 per cent of Canadians agree that \"there are too many immigrants coming into this country who are not adopting Canadian values.\" \n\nThe Charter of the French Language is Quebec legislation that makes French the official language of Quebec. Among other things, the Charter requires:\n\n\nThe Quebec Charter of Values is legislation that was proposed in the Quebec legislature in 2013 but which was not enacted into law. It would ban public sector employees from wearing conspicuous religious symbols. Article 5 in Chapter II states:\n\nJustin Trudeau has been a champion of the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\"; he opposed the \"Quebec Charter of Values.\" He stated: \"Prohibiting someone from wearing a hijab or a kippah is not compatible with Quebec and Canadian values.\"\n\nProposed changes to the Canadian Constitution included adding the phrase \"distinct society\" to the Constitution Act, 1867 to recognizes the uniqueness of Quebec as compared with the rest of Canada.\n\nDefining Canadian values is problematic if the goal is to identify values that are universally held.\n\nAccording to Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reporter Neil Macdonald, there are \"precious few notions that can accurately be described as universally held Canadian values.\"\n\nAccording to journalist Lysiane Gagnon, Canadians \"don't share common values.\" She notes that while many ideas - such as medicare, bilingualism, and multiculturalism - are sometimes characterized as Canadian values, \"many Canadians are against all or some of these.\"\n\nCanadian sociologist Vic Satzewich has argued that \"coming up with a universal set of our nation's values would be impossible.\"\n\nThe Institute for Canadian Values sponsored advertisements against the teaching of certain sexual education topics in the Ontario school curriculum and discriminated against transsexual, transgender, and intersex persons. The advertisements were controversial and quickly discontinued.\n\nScholars have asked whether shared values underpin national identity. Denis Stairs links the concept of Canadian values with nationalism. Stairs, the McCulloch Professor in Political Science at Dalhousie University, has argued that there is indeed an intense widespread belief in the existence of Canadian values, but says that belief can itself be harmful. He contends that:\n\nStairs also argues that, \"first billing is usually given in received lists of Canadian values to 'multiculturalism'...as a means of challenging the premises of nationalism in Quebec.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5025767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5025767", "title": "Cargo system", "text": "Cargo system\n\nThe cargo system (also known as the civil-religious hierarchy, \"fiesta\" or \"mayordomía\" system) is a collection of secular and religious positions held by men or households in rural indigenous communities throughout central and southern Mexico and Central America. These revolving offices, or \"cargos\", become the unpaid responsibility of men who are active in civic life. They typically hold a given post for a term of one year, and alternate between civic and religious obligations from year to year. Office holders execute most of the tasks of local governments and churches. Individuals who hold a cargo are generally obligated to incur the costs of feasting during the \"fiestas\" that honor particular saints.\n\nWhere it is practiced, there is generally some expectation of all local men to take part in this cargo system throughout their lives. Office holders assume greater responsibilities as they grow in stature in the community. Such progression requires substantial financial resources, but eventually an individual who holds a requisite number of posts in service to his community retires and joins a group of elders instrumental in community decision-making, including appointing people to cargos.\n\nThis expectation of local men to take part in this system is both an economic and a social one, as those who do not contribute are seen as not being deserving of living in the village. It served to create a village system where the old were helped by the young and women helped by men. Furthermore, the legal enforcement of village obligations solidified communal (social) identity, rather than an identity dependent upon and linked to the national state. The cargo system has also been considered influenced by traditional Hispanic customs, as the municipal government provided the tradition of \"cargas consejiles', where village residents are obligated to serve post terms.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, the cargo system was a ladder system in which indigenous men could climb up. The cargo system was mainly defined as a public labor and community service. Villages that were impoverished were able to get help easier because taxes were not charged, yet public work was given. It was a system in which involved faithful and long term community service. Men and women (husband and wife) were considered one unit, men needed their wives in order to succeed in their community. Women did not claim rights in relation to village government.\n\nThe origins of the cargo system are tied to the efforts of Spanish missionaries to convert indigenous peoples of the Americas to Christianity while at the same time forestalling their cultural Hispanicization. After the Spanish conquest of Mesoamerica in the 16th century, many Indians were forcibly relocated to pueblos, which like Spanish villages contained a church as the town center. Priests were one of many special interest foreigners who had control over the political and social affairs of indigenous peoples, and they had dominion over many of these pueblos and had the authority to keep other colonists out. The priests were mindful that much of their influence over the Indians stemmed from the priests' ability to speak Indian languages. Despite a 1550 royal edict calling for native peoples to be taught the Spanish language, missionaries continued to minister to them in Nahuatl and other local languages, thus preserving a major source of Indian dependency on the church. The colonial church did not insist on excessive Catholicization of existing indigenous practices, so long as there was no clear conflict between the two.\n\nBecause the missionaries were small in number, they increasingly placed religious responsibilities in the hands of trusted members of the villages. The village mayor or \"alcalde\" was charged with the responsibility of leading the villagers in a procession to Sunday Mass. Over time, these processions were conducted with greater ceremony, making use of trappings such as crosses, incense, and music.\n\nThe cargo system was used and transformed by communities within the context of law to eliminate noble exemption privileges. This brought to an end many internal feuds over \"principales\" with regards to nobility. Noble exemptions were opposed by the common people, who were worried that such exemptions would negatively impact the supply of labour to the point of constant service. It was impossible to become part of the nobility by marrying the daughter of a noble, and was instead pushed by claimants based on heritage. Therefore, in practice, the system was not as egalitarian as in the hypothetical sense, because while some men could move to greater positions and into seats of authority, others lacked the prestige to accomplish the same. The dispersal of the ability to accumulate wealth along with prestige also contributed greatly to the transformation of these villages.\n\nOn occasion drawing on a Spanish institution called the \"cofradías\", the priests created a hierarchy of village posts in order to better organize the religious and civil lives of their Indians. Indigenous people filled these roles, which in theory gave them greater status within the community. These roles, however, also placed economic obligations on their recipients and the clergy used them as a way to exercise control over the villagers. Villagers were obligated to organize efforts to discharge debts related to cost of food, wafers and wine for the Mass and payment of the priests.\n\nThe cargo system could a serve a manner in which people could elevate their station in society. People who faithfully discharged their duties through a series of mundane tasks could increase their social status which resulted in greater access for job opportunities and loftier positions. In short, community service allowed one to move up in the hierarchy of their society. Eventually villagers could reach a high ranking position as members of the principals, who in turn would vote for the communal leader, the gobernadores. The \"caciques\" ore pre-Hispanic nobles were exempt from the low standing positions, although a person from meager beginnings could ultimately serve to accumulate wealth and power.\n\nThe cargo system also affected marital life. The man would work in the household of his in-laws. After marriage, the wife would move in with the groom’s family in which she served as a domestic servant for her mother-in law.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2910007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2910007", "title": "Character arc", "text": "Character arc\n\nA character arc is the transformation or inner journey of a character over the course of a story. If a story has a character arc, the character begins as one sort of person and gradually transforms into a different sort of person in response to changing developments in the story. Since the change is often substantive and leading from one personality trait to a diametrically opposite trait (for example, from greed to benevolence), the geometric term \"arc\" is often used to describe the sweeping change. In most stories, lead characters and protagonists are the characters most likely to experience character arcs, although it is possible for lesser characters to change as well. A driving element of the plots of many stories is that the main character seems initially unable to overcome opposing forces, possibly because they lack skills or knowledge or resources or friends. To overcome such obstacles, the protagonist must change, possibly by learning new skills, to arrive at a higher sense of self-awareness or capability. Protagonists can achieve such self-awareness by interacting with their environment, by enlisting the help of mentors, by changing their viewpoint, or by some other method.\n\nThroughout the trajectory of narratives with a tripartite structure, character arcs often unfold beside the narrative arc in the following way:\n\nDuring the first act, the character arc is established or re-established for at least one character, the main character (the protagonist), within the exposition (noument) of the environment including relationships to other characters. Later in the first act, a dynamic, on-screen incident, known as the inciting incident, or catalyst occurs that confronts the protagonist, whose attempts to deal with this incident lead to a second and more dramatic situation, known as the first turning point. After the first turning point, life will never be the same for the protagonist and raises a dramatic question that will be answered in the climax of the story. The dramatic question should be framed in terms of the protagonist's call to action, for example, Will X recover the diamond? Will Y get the girl? Will Z capture the killer?\n\nDuring the second act, also referred to as \"rising action\", the character arc develops as the protagonist attempts to resolve the problem initiated by the first turning point, only to discover ever-worsening situations, which often lead to the learning of new skills, the discovery of capabilities, and (sometimes late in the second act if at all) the raising of self-awareness.\n\nDuring the third act, including the climax, \"falling action\" and resolution (denouement), the narrative arc is completed although the character arc typically is not. During the climax, because the main tensions of the story are brought to their most intense point and the dramatic question is answered, a character arc reaches a place where the character gains a new sense of who they are becoming. As the plot and its subplots resolve, the character arc's emphasis shifts from the learning of any new skills or the discovery of dormant capabilities to the awakening of a higher level of self-awareness, which in turn changes who the character is becoming.\n\nSome examples include:\n\n\nSome examples include:\n\n\nLike a story arc, which often is composed of many narrative arcs, the character arc is not confined within the limits of one narrative. The character arc may extend over to the next story, a sequel, or another episode. In episodic TV series, the character arc functions as a narrative hook that writers often use to ensure viewers continue watching.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18254497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18254497", "title": "Comic book letter column", "text": "Comic book letter column\n\nA comic book letter column is a section of an American comic book where readers' letters to the publisher appear. Comic book letter columns are also commonly referred to as letter columns (or lettercols), letter pages, letters of comment (LOCs), or simply letters to the editor. Letter columns appeared early on in the history of comic books themselves, and their growing prevalence — particularly beginning in the 1960s — helped create and legitimatize comics fandom. Letter columns remained a regular feature of most comic books until the early years of the 21st century, when they were gradually phased out in favor of the growing prevalence of email and Internet forums.\n\nAlthough they were already standard in the science fiction magazines of the time, the first recorded comic book letter column appeared in \"Target Comics\" #6, published by Novelty Press in 1940. (The page in question also has an early mention of comic book collecting.) The first DC Comics comic to include a letters column was \"Real Fact Comics\" #3 (Jul-Aug 1946). The first DC title with a letters column as a regular feature was \"Superman\" beginning with issue #124 (September 1958).\n\nEarly versions of the lettercol tended to be simple fan letters, often from young readers. These letters tended to be praise for the previous issue's story and artwork; or simplistic questions about the correct pronunciation of \"Mxyzptlk\" or where Superman put his Clark Kent clothes when he was in costume; or alternately, obsessive dissections of perceived continuity errors or art mistakes.\n\nLetter columns came into their prime in the 1960s, when readers' letters became longer and the discussions more sophisticated. For example, in the mid-1960s longtime letter writer (and future comics historian) Peter Sanderson's lengthy, well-reasoned, and impressively erudite missives forced DC editor Julie Schwartz to expand the lettercols in his books to a second, separate page (such as \"Flash-Grams — Extra\", \"Letters To the Batcave — Extra\", and \"JLA Mailroom — Special Peter Sanderson Edition\") to facilitate Sanderson's sharp analysis.\n\nBy the 1970s, nearly all mainstream comics included letter pages. Historian Matthew J. Pustz describes the different approaches of the two major publishers, DC and Marvel Comics:\nAs the letter column became a longstanding tradition in the mainstream comic book industry, it even became a feature of underground, independent, and alternative comics of the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s, a trend in letter writing developed in which readers would send in specific, bulleted questions about the direction of the series, plot points, etc.; which were often answered (or evaded) by the writer or editor point-by-point.\n\nBy the first few years of the 21st century, as comic-related forums sprang up all over the Internet, letter columns were gradually replaced by advertisements or in-house promotions. In 2002, DC officially ended the practice of the letter page — only to bring it back in 2011. Many independent titles (such as \"Usagi Yojimbo\", \"Hellboy\", \"Optic Nerve\", \"Palookaville\", \"The Walking Dead\", \"Chew\", and \"King-Cat Comics\") still feature letters pages to this day.\n\nAs standardized by the big mainstream American companies, the letter column was typically overseen by one of the comic’s staff members, often the book’s editor (or later on, the assistant editor), and occasionally the book’s writer(s).\n\nThe letters page was often used as a soapbox, where in addition to responding to reader comments, the editor would provide behind-the-scenes details about the comics world, announce changes to the title or the creative team, plea for more (or better) letters, needle the competition, and otherwise communicate with readers.\n\nDue to the monthly (or longer) lag between issues, a comic’s letter column usually featured reader responses to issues about three-to-five months prior to the current one. Occasionally, if a story ran too long one month, or there were printer-related problems, a comic's letters page would be omitted that issue. This would often produce an outcry from deprived readers in later letter columns, accompanied by the requisite apologies and explanations.\n\nUntil the late-1970s, letter columns were usually found in the middle of the book, when they mostly moved to the book’s second-to-last page (the last page tending to be an advertisement).\n\nToward the end of 1960 — thanks in no small part to the urging of motivated readers like Jerry Bails (later to be known as the '\"father of comics fandom\") and Roy Thomas — DC editor Julius Schwartz decided to print readers' home addresses in the letters, a custom of long standing in science fiction magazines and one which helped originate science fiction fandom (where Schwartz himself got his start in publishing). The first letters page with the letter writers' full addresses appeared in \"The Brave and the Bold\" #35 (May 1961). Because of this practice, many readers connected with each other, becoming penpals, and starting communities of fans and/or publishing fanzines. In a number of cases, readers (including future \"X-Men\" artist Dave Cockrum) \"met\" their future spouses via a comic book letter page.\n\nPeter Sanderson writes of Schwartz's letter columns:\nSimilarly, under the guidance of editor-in-chief/publisher Stan Lee, Marvel Comics also decided to print readers' home addresses in the letters. Lee made it a priority to create a community of readers, giving them a sense of personal investment in Marvel and its titles. Lee's ambition to create a company aesthetic in this way was overwhelming successful; many Marvel fans would sign off their letters with the phrase, \"Make Mine Marvel!\"\n\nFor many fans, having a letter printed was a badge of honor — especially if it was in one of the more high-profile letters pages. The feeling was that if one wrote enough good letters, it was possible to influence the direction of the comic and/or one's favorite characters. And as letters pages became more collaborative in this way, many became forums for long-running discussions among the editors and readers, with topics ranging from what defined a \"mutant\" to real-world issues such as religion, racism, feminism, gay rights, and the rights of the disabled. \"Cerebus\" creator Dave Sim's comments about women, for example, became the source of a particularly long-running and bitter debate in the pages of \"Aardvark Comment\".\n\nIn certain circumstances, it was practice for Marvel and DC to solicit letters for titles which had trouble filling a letters page each month. While popular titles could receive up to 40 or more letters per month, other titles might not receive enough to even fill a page. In desperate circumstances, DC and Marvel lettercol assemblers were even known to write fake letters under assumed names, just to fill out the column.\n\nFor some time in the 1970s, Marvel editors (and assistant editors, like Mark Gruenwald) responded to readers' letters in the guise of a \"friendly armadillo.\" Beginning in 1980, under new editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, Marvel instituted new letter column policies. One change was to let writers of certain titles (rather than the book's editor) manage the letters pages. The other was to eliminate the conceit of the \"armadillo\" and have the books' editors or writers respond to letters under the own names.\n\nIn later years, some DC Comics letters pages — like those in \"Lobo\" and \"Ambush Bug\" — used the humorous device of having the main character \"respond\" to letters. Marvel's Deadpool, as part of his regular practice of breaking the \"fourth wall,\" also answered his own letters.\n\nThe letters page also functioned as another form of \"house ad,\" a place to promote the book, other books in the same line, or the comic book publishing company in general. Some had additional purposes such as in the 1980s \"The Question\" series, written by Dennis O'Neil, whose letters pages included a reading recommendation with each issue to complement the philosophical points illustrated in the feature story.\n\nThe typical letters page had its own title, which was usually a reference to the book’s hero or heroes. \"Cape and Cowl Comments\" (\"World's Finest Comics\"), \"JLA Mailroom\" (\"Justice League of America\"), \"Legion Outpost\" (\"Legion of Super-Heroes\"), \"Metropolis Mailbag,\" (\"Superman\"), \"Avengers Assemble!\" (\"Avengers\"), \"Letters to the Living Legend,\" (\"Captain America\"), \"The Spider's Web\" (\"The Amazing Spider-Man\"), and \"X-Mail,\" (\"Uncanny X-Men\") are just a few examples of this tradition. \"Suicide Squad\" faced difficulties in this aspect, as the United States Postal Service objected to delivering what were labeled as \"Suicide Notes.\"\n\nSome books had trouble sticking with a lettercol title, and changed them on a more or less regular basis. It soon became a tradition to hold a contest for fans to write in with column title ideas, with the winning writer credited in the letters page. Similarly, when a new comic book series was created, readers were asked to submit names for the lettercol title right from the outset.\n\nJerry Bails may have been the first reader to believe he could influence the direction of his favorite comics. In the early 1960s, he bombarded the DC offices with suggestions for new superhero revivals such as was already happening with the Flash, the Justice League, and so on. For instance, in \"Justice League of America\" #4, the letters page is filled with missives from Bails under different pen names. He did everything he could to fool editor Julius Schwartz, including mailing the letters from all across the country.\n\nLater on, during the lettercol heyday of the 1970s and 1980s, many comics actively encouraged reader participation. Fans were asked to weigh in on a character’s uniform changes, or in some cases, submit their own uniform designs, with the winning entry actually becoming the character’s new costume. Readers of \"Tomb of Dracula\" and \"The Vision and Scarlet Witch\" limited series were asked to suggest names for the main characters' babies. (Winners of contests liked these were often awarded with original artwork from the book in question.)\n\nFor team books like \"The Avengers\", \"Justice League\", or the \"Legion of Super-Heroes\", fans were polled as to which characters should become permanent members, team leaders, or conversely, excised from the team. (Readers were also asked to suggest or vote on the title of the letter column. See further discussion below.)\nMany 1970s Marvel lettercols stressed the importance of reader feedback, such as this one from \"Power Man\" #24 (April 1975): \"We don't score hits with every issue. Sometimes a story has flaws or just doesn't come up to snuff. Which is why your letters are so valuable to us in producing these comments. . . . So don't let anybody tell you your letters aren't important, people. They are vital to these magazines.\"\n\nSimilarly, (beginning in the 1980s) the most esteemed letterhacks were occasionally solicited to send letters based on early preview copies, thus helping to build a fan-base for a new title. And in a few cases, low-selling titles were saved from cancellation by groups of dedicated fans writing in to the company’s editor-in-chief or publisher.\n\nFans whose letters were published regularly became well known throughout the industry by virtue of their letters. Writer Mark Engblom describes the phenomenon this way:\n\nSome of the most prolific \"LOCers\" or \"letterhacks\" include Jerry Bails, T.M. Maple (who published over 3,000 letters), Augie De Blieck, Jr. (who claims to have published over 400 letters), Bill Schelly (now a comic book historian), Peter Sanderson (ditto), and Irene Vartanoff (an omnipresent 1960s letterhack who ended up working behind the scenes for Marvel in the 1970s and 1980s).\n\nAs discussed above, some letterhacks gained entrée into an actual career in comics because of their letter-writing expertise. For instance, Bob Rozakis parlayed his frequent published letters to DC comics during the late 1960s and early 1970s into a job as DC's \"Answer Man\" and eventually a solid career as a DC writer. Kurt Busiek, Mary Jo Duffy, Mike Friedrich, Mark Gruenwald, Fred Hembeck, Tony Isabella, Paul Levitz, Ralph Macchio, Dean Mullaney, Martin Pasko, Diana Schutz, Beau Smith, Roy Thomas, and Kim Thompson are just a few of the many comic book professionals who got their starts as young letterhacks.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43654761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43654761", "title": "Fashion tourism", "text": "Fashion tourism\n\nFashion tourism is a niche market segment evolved out of three major sectors: Creative Tourism, Cultural Tourism and Shopping Tourism. Fashion Tourism can be defined as “the interaction between Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs), trade associations, tourism suppliers and host communities, with people travelling to and visiting a particular place for business or leisure to enjoy, experiment, discover, study, trade, communicate about and consume fashion.”\n\nAll over the world today cities are increasingly using the cultural industries for the development of tourism and other industries to boost their economic fortune and to position themselves in the global market. There is often no need for cities to specialize in any new activity but rather to diversify their economy and it is in this context that fashion tourism has been adopted and promoted in many cities. See examples for Antwerp, London, and Tokyo. Fashion is a global industry and many capital cities have press-grabbing trade activity at least twice a year, e.g. London through its London Fashion Week, and this is often the starting point for many DMOs to take fashion seriously as a new anchor for their tourism industry and visitor economy. They are consciously pushing fashion week trade events into the public eye to raise their city’s fashionable credentials and encourage visitors to consider travel to their city.\n\nLondon (via the Mayor of London’s office) and New York (via the New York City Economic Development Council) government offices have been leading the way internationally to use their fashion credentials to attract visitors to their cities and wider. Other cities also following suit having seen the economic impact which London and New York’s fashion credentials can bring. Seoul now has two fashion weeks, and riding on the reputation of these, the city now has a vast complex of shopping malls and wholesale retailers which attract more than two million visitors per year, including just about half of all the tourists who come to Seoul. Singapore also has a fashion week and the Singapore Tourism Board includes fashion as one of the high-profile component for enhancing the city’s destination attractiveness.\n\nEven a city as obscure as Lagos, Nigeria, (in terms of fashion credentials) has recently commissioned the Central University of Applied Sciences to prepare a report titled ‘The Emerging Role of Fashion Tourism and The Need for a Development Strategy’ so that they could assess the advantages fashion could bring to their local and regional economy.\n\nShopping has become a motive to travel and is now a major tourist activity. Visitors are increasingly choosing shopping as a way to experience local culture through an engagement with local products and local craftspeople, and some destinations provide special tourist shopping activities for tourists to shop for goods. As a niche market segment within shopping tourism, the economic importance of fashion tourism cannot be under-estimated. The recently launched Bicester designer shopping village, an hours train journey out of London is now the third largest shopping destination in the UK after Harrods and Selfridges, and the Bicester train station has signage in Mandarin and Arabic. Individual fashion brands also play a major part in fashion tourism marketing. VisitBritain, the UK’s tourism board, recently stated that the luxury clothing brand Burberry has almost played a lone hand in attracting lucrative high-spending Chinese tourists to the UK.\n\nAccording to the tourism statistical data of the U.S. Office of Travel and Tourism Industries on tourism performance, shopping ranked as the top participation activity for Asians (90%) and Western Europeans (86%), and Eastern European tourists (85%). Detailed profiles for countries of origin show that shopping is on the top among all other tourist activities for the European countries of Ireland (93%), Spain (82%), and Italy (79%). Asian shopping participation percentages are particularly high in Taiwan (93%) and Japan (92%).\n\nThere are increasing incentives to travel for economic reasons, as purchasing power and currency fluctuations can play an important role in travel decision making, as well as relative price positioning. There is a trend within shopping tourism for consumers from emerging markets, notably China and South America, to plan their trips according to where fashion handsbags are cheapest. Up to 50% of sales of luxury goods in Western Europe are generated by foreigners and global travel generates as much as 30% of total sales of luxury goods. The queues of non-Parisians outside Louis Vuitton clearly mean something, but according to an HSBC report ‘The Bling Dynasty’, this is less about status (the chic of buying from the point of origin) than economic intelligence (the savings involved). This isn’t limited to luxury products. Brazil has overtaken the UK as the source of the largest group of tourists to Florida and New York, and they spend close to twice as much as British tourists on products, partly because they can make savings of up to 70% on US merchandise compared to its cost in Brazil.. The nature of shopping tourism is certainly changing: “It’s not about souvenirs - it’s about savings”.\n\n"}

This idea has been interpreted in many senses, as a female mind, spirit, soul, personality, etc., as well as in more literal senses such as having a female brain structure; it is also a psychological narrative, that is, a self-description of how some transsexuals see themselves, or of how they may portray themselves to qualify for certain medical treatments.\n\nAccording to sexologist J. Michael Bailey and Kiira Triea, \"the predominant cultural understanding of male-to-female transsexualism is that all male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals are, essentially, women trapped in men's bodies.\" They reject the idea, claiming that \"The persistence of the predominant cultural understanding, while explicable, is damaging to science and to many transsexuals.\" According to sexologist Ray Blanchard, \"Transsexuals seized upon this phrase as the only language available for explaining their predicament to themselves and for communicating their feelings to others. The great majority of patients understand full well that this is a \"façon de parler,\" not a literal statement of fact, and are not delusional in any normal sense of the word.\"\n\nThe feminine essence idea has been described under several names, and there is no authoritative, widely accepted definition. It was called the \"feminine essence narrative\" by Alice Dreger in 2008, and the \"feminine essence theory\" by Ray Blanchard, who formulated the concept into a set of logical propositions. Other names include \"Harry Benjamin syndrome\", after one of the early sexologists whose early writings about the nature of transsexualism, along with those of psychiatrist David O. Cauldwell, are favorably cited by proponents in support of this idea.\n\nThis idea is associated with, but separate from the brainsex theory of transsexualism, which is a belief about a neurodevelopmental cause of transsexualism. Proponents of the brainsex theory of transsexualism draw a distinction between \"brain sex\" and \"anatomical sex\". Some proponents reject the term \"transsexual\", as the \"trans-\" prefix implies that their true sex is changing, instead of being affirmed, with treatments like sex reassignment surgery. Some proponents consider themselves to be intersex instead of transgender. A figurative interpretation, involving neurologically mediated gender identity, was supported historically by pioneering sexologists such as Harry Benjamin.\n\nThe \"feminine essence\" idea predates modern psychological studies, and was supported by some early sexologists such as Harry Benjamin (\"the father of transsexualism\"), who revived the idea of Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs that a person might have a \"female soul trapped in a male body.\"\n\nModern researchers classify the common story told by transsexual women about themselves as a psychological narrative, and therefore refer to this idea as the \"feminine essence narrative\". In his book \"The Man Who Would Be Queen\", sexologist J. Michael Bailey gives these statements as a prototypical example of the feminine essence narrative: \"Since I can remember, I have always felt as if I were a member of the other sex. I have felt like a freak with this body and detest my penis. I must get sex reassignment surgery (a \"sex change operation\") in order to match my external body with my internal mind.\"\n\nIn 2008, Ray Blanchard presented the idea in the form of a theory in a commentary entitled \"Deconstructing the Feminine Essence Narrative\" in which he lists what he considers to be \"the central tenets of the feminine essence theory\", and then refutes each of these tenets:\n\nAccording to Bailey and Triea, one of the predictions based on the feminine essence theory is that male-to-female transsexuals would possess female rather than male brain anatomy. A widely cited research study of this topic examined the brain anatomy of six deceased male-to-female transsexuals, who had undergone during their lives hormonal treatment and surgical sex reassignment. The study reported that a brain structure called the \"central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis\" (BSTc), which is larger in typical males than in typical females, was in the female range in the transsexual subjects. The interpretation and the methods of that study have been criticized, and the finding continues to be a matter of debate.\n\nNeurological research has found that the brains of transsexuals differ in a number of ways. For example, a study done on the brains of non-homosexual transsexuals using MRI and pheromones as stimuli found that transsexuals process smelling androgen and estrogen in the same way that women do. Previous research by the same team found that homosexual males also process smelling the pheromones of the sexes in a way that is similar to that of women. Work done by Simon LeVay had previously found that the hypothalamus of homosexual males has a region which is similar in size to that of heterosexual females. This is not so in non-homosexual males. Last but not least a study done by Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol reached the conclusion that the brain does change in overall volume and the volume of its parts with the use of cross-sex hormone supplements. In the case of male-to-female transsexuals, the brain assumes the proportions of a female brain.\n\nThe main support for the feminine essence narrative is that many male-to-female transsexuals say they feel it to be true; many autobiographical and clinical accounts by or about transsexual individuals contain variations of the statement of having a female soul or needing to make the external body resemble the inner or true self.\n\nCritics of this narrative consider it to be inconsistent with their research findings. Blanchard has reported finding that there are two, and not one, types of male-to-female transsexual and that they differ with regard to their sexual interests, whether they were overtly gender atypical in childhood, how easily they pass as female, the ages at which they decide to transition to female, birth order, and their physical height and weight. There have also been findings that the groups differ in how well they respond to sex reassignment and how likely they are to regret having transitioned. These sexologists have therefore posited that more than one motivator can lead a biological male to desire to live life as female, but that there is no evidence for a core essence of femininity.\n\nSince the medical community has guidelines for what types of individuals qualify for sex reassignment surgery, transsexual persons sometimes adopt and tell the story that they believe will best help them qualify – the \"feminine essence narrative\" – and representing themselves as \"essentially female\", which may explain at least part of the prevalence of the feminine essence narrative.\n\nThe phrase \"feminine soul enclosed in a male body\" (\"anima muliebris in corpore virili inclusa\") was introduced in 1868 by Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs, not to describe male-to-female transsexuals, none of whom existed yet as such, but to describe a type of gay men who self-identified as feminine. Major sexologists in the 19th century picked up the idea that a homosexual was \"a female soul in a male body, a condition deriving from an error in embryonic differentiation.\"\nThose homosexuals who felt themselves to be female were categorized, \"in the interest of scientific precision,\" as \"urnings\" (now known as uranians).\n\n"}
{"id": "7334837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7334837", "title": "Flipped image", "text": "Flipped image\n\nA flipped image or reversed image, the more formal term, is a static or moving image that is generated by a mirror-reversal of an original across a horizontal axis (a \"flopped\" image is mirrored across the vertical axis). Many printmaking techniques produce images where the printed copy is reversed from the image made on the printing plate, so in a print copying another image, or a real scene or object, unless the artist deliberately creates the plate as a mirror-image of his subject, the finished print will be a mirror image of it. Many print makers developed the skill of reversing images when making printing plates, but many prints, especially early ones, have images that are reversed.\n\nMany large format cameras present the image of the scene being photographed as a flipped image through their viewfinders. Some photographers regard this as a beneficial feature, as the unfamiliarity of the format allows them to compose the elements of the picture properly without being distracted by the actual contents of the scene. The technique is meant to bypass or override the brain's visual processing which normally sees what is expected rather than what is there.\n\nFlipping is occasionally used as a trompe l'oeil effect in scenes which incorporate reflections in a body of water. The image is deliberately inverted so that people slowly discern that something is 'not quite right' with the picture, and come to notice that it is upside down.\n"}
{"id": "2592939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2592939", "title": "Haida language", "text": "Haida language\n\nHaida (', ', ', ',) is the language of the Haida people, spoken in the Haida Gwaii archipelago of the coast of Canada and on Prince of Wales Island in Alaska. An endangered language by a book put out by UNESCO, Haida currently has 14 native speakers, though revitalization efforts are underway. At the time of the European arrival at in 1774, it is estimated that Haida speakers numbered about 15,000. Epidemics soon led to a drastic reduction in the Haida population, which became limited to three villages: Masset, Skidegate, and Hydaburg. Positive attitudes towards assimilation combined with the ban on speaking Haida in residential schools led to a sharp decline in the use of the Haida language among the Haida people, and today almost all ethnic Haida use English to communicate.\n\nClassification of the Haida language is a matter of controversy, with some linguists placing it in the Na-Dené language family and others arguing that it is a language isolate. Haida itself is split between Northern and Southern dialects, which differ primarily in phonology. The Northern Haida dialects have developed pharyngeal consonants, typologically uncommon sounds which are also found in some of the nearby Salishan and Wakashan languages.\n\nThe Haida sound system includes ejective consonants, glottalized sonorants, contrastive vowel length, and phonemic tone. The nature of tone differs between the dialects, and in Alaskan Haida it is primarily a pitch accent system. Syllabic laterals appear in all dialects of Haida, but are only phonemic in Skidegate Haida. Extra vowels which are not present in Haida words occur in nonsense words in Haida songs. There are a number of systems for writing Haida using the Latin alphabet, each of which represents the sounds of Haida differently.\n\nWhile Haida has nouns and verbs, it does not have adjectives and has few true adpositions. English adjectives translate into verbs in Haida, for example ' \"(to be) good\", and English prepositional phrases are usually expressed with Haida \"relational nouns\", for instance Alaskan Haida ' 'side facing away from the beach, towards the woods'. Haida verbs are marked for tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality, and person is marked by pronouns that are cliticized to the verb. Haida also has hundreds of classifiers. Haida has the rare direct-inverse word order type, where both SOV and OSV words orders occur depending on the \"potency\" of the subject and object of the verb. Haida also has obligatory possession, where certain types of nouns cannot stand alone and require a possessor.\n\nThe first documented contact between the Haida and Europeans was in 1772, on Juan Pérez's exploratory voyage. At this time Haidas inhabited the , Dall Island, and Prince of Wales Island. The precontact Haida population was about 15,000; the first smallpox epidemic came soon after initial contact, reducing the population to about 10,000 and depopulating a large portion of the Ninstints dialect area. The next epidemic came in 1862, causing the population to drop to 1,658. Venereal disease and tuberculosis further reduced the population to 588 by 1915. This dramatic decline led to the merger of villages, the final result being three Haida villages: Masset (merged 1876), Skidegate (merged 1879), and Hydaburg (merged 1911).\nIn the 1830s a pidgin trade language based on Haida, known as Haida Jargon, was used in the islands by speakers of English, Haida, Coast Tsimshian, and Heiltsuk. The Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858 lead to a boom in the town of Victoria, and Southern Haida began traveling there annually, mainly for the purpose of selling their women. For this the Haida used Chinook Jargon. This contact with whites had a strong effect on the Southern Haida, even as the Northern Haida remained culturally conservative. For instance, Skidegate Haida were reported as dressing in the European fashion in 1866, while Northern Haida \"were still wearing bearskins and blankets ten years later.\"\n\nIn 1862, William Duncan, a British Anglican missionary stationed at Fort Simpson, took fifty Tsimshian converts and created a new model community, Metlakatla. The new village was greatly successful, and throughout the Northwest coast the attitude spread that abandoning tradition would pave the way for a better life. The Haida themselves invited missionaries to their community, the first arriving in 1876. These missionaries initially worked in the Haida language. The Rev. John Henry Keen translated the Book of Common Prayer into Haida, published in 1899 in London by the Missionary Society. The books of Matthew, Luke, John and Acts from the New Testament would also be translated into Haida and published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 1890s. However, negative attitudes towards the use of the Haida language were widespread among the Haida people, even in the fairly conservative village of Masset where Keen was located. In an 1894 letter, Keen wrote:\n\nBeginning at the turn of the century, Haida began sending their children to residential schools. This practice was most widespread among the Southern Haida; among the Northern Haida it was practiced by the more \"progressive\" families. These schools strictly enforced a ban on the use of native languages, and played a major role in the decimation of native Northwest Coast languages. The practice of Haida families using English to address children spread in Masset in the 1930s, having already been practiced in Skidegate, the rationale being that this would aid the children in their school education. After this point few children were raised with Haida as a primary language.\n\nToday most Haidas do not speak the Haida language. The language is listed as \"critically endangered\" in UNESCO's \"Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger\", with nearly all speakers elderly. As of 2003, most speakers of Haida are between 70 and 80 years of age, though they speak a \"considerably simplified\" form of Haida, and comprehension of the language is mostly limited to persons above the age of 50. The language is rarely used even among the remaining speakers and comprehenders.\n\nThe Haida have a renewed interest in their traditional culture, and are now funding Haida language programs in schools in the three Haida communities, though these have been ineffectual. Haida classes are available in many Haida communities and can be taken at the University of Alaska Southeast in Juneau, Ketchikan, and Hydaburg. A Skidegate Haida language app is available for iPhone, based on a \"bilingual dictionary and phrase collection words and phrases archived at the online Aboriginal language database FirstVoices.com.\"\n\nIn 2017 Kingulliit Productions was working on the first feature film to be acted entirely in Haida language; the actors had to be trained to pronounce the lines correctly.\n\nFranz Boas first suggested that Haida might be genetically related to the Tlingit language in 1894, and linguist Edward Sapir included Haida in the Na-Dené language family in 1915. This position was later supported by others, including Swanton, Pinnow, and Greenberg and Ruhlen. Today, however, many linguists regard Haida as a language isolate. This theory is not universally accepted; for example, Enrico (2004) argues that Haida does in fact belong to the Na-Dené family, though early loanwords make the evidence problematic. A proposal linking Na-Dené to the Yeniseian family of central Siberia finds no evidence for including Haida.\n\nHaida has a major dialectal division between Northern and Southern dialects. Northern Haida is split into Alaskan (or Kaigani) Haida and Masset (or North Graham Island) Haida. Southern Haida was originally split into Skidegate Haida and Ninstints Haida, but Ninstints Haida is now extinct and is poorly documented. The dialects differ in phonology and to some extent vocabulary; however, they are grammatically mostly identical.\n\nNorthern Haida is notable for its pharyngeal consonants. Pharyngeal consonants are rare among the world's languages, even in North America. They are an areal feature of some languages in a small portion of Northwest America, in the Salishan and Wakashan languages as well as Haida. The pharyngeal consonants of Wakashan and Northern Haida are known to have developed recently.\n\n\nIn Alaskan Haida, all velar, uvular, and epiglottal consonants, as well as for some speakers, have rounded variants resulting from coalescence of clusters with . Alaskan Haida also shows simplification of to when preceding an alveolar or postalveolar obstruent, and of to .\n\nIn Skidegate Haida, has allophone in syllable-final position.\n\nMasset Haida phonology is complicated by various spreading processes caused by contiguous sonorants across morpheme boundaries, caused by loss of consonants in morpheme-initial position.\n\nThe high vowels may be realized as upper mid to high and include lax as well as tense values.\n\nThe vowels are rare in Skidegate Haida. only occurs in some interjections and borrowings, and only occurs in the two words ' \"five\" and ' (a clitic). In Masset Haida and are both very common are involved in spreading and ablaut processes. Alaskan Haida has neither of these, but has a diphthong , introduced from contraction of low-toned and sequences.\n\nIn Skidegate Haida some instances of the vowel are on an underlying level unspecified for quality; Enrico (2003) marks specified with the symbol . Unspecified becomes after , after (non-lateral) alveolar and palatal consonants, and syllabic after lateral consonants. This does not exist in Masset Haida. A small class of Masset Haida words has a new vowel in place of this unspecified vowel which differs in quality from the vowel . \n\nA number of the contrasts between vowels, or sequences of vowels and the semivowels and , are neutralized in certain positions:\n\nThe vowels and short occur in nonsense syllables in Haida songs.\n\nHaida features phonemic tone, the nature of which differs by dialect.\n\nThe Canadian dialects (Skidegate and Masset) have a tone system with low functional load. Unmarked heavy syllables (those with long vowels or ending in sonorants) have high pitch, and unmarked light syllables have low pitch: ' \"dog\", ' \"sapwood\". Examples of marked syllables include ' \"among\" (Masset), ' \"tiny\" (Skidegate). In Masset Haida marked low tone syllables are more common, resulting from elision of intervocalic consonants: compare Skidegate ' to Masset ' \"net\". Some alternations may be interpreted as results of syllable parsing rather than marked tone: compare Masset ' \"muskreg\" to ' 'be suspicious of' , where \"\" marks a syllable boundary.\n\nIn Skidegate Haida, short vowels which do not have marked tone are phonetically lengthened when they are in a word-initial open syllable, thus ' \"grass\" becomes ' \"grassy\".\n\nIn Masset Haida, marked low tone syllables have extra length, thus ' \"thing\", ' \"mother\".\n\nIn Kaigani the system is primarily one of pitch accent, with at most one syllable per word featuring high tone in most words, though there are some exceptions (e.g. \"\" \"almost\"), and it is not always clear what should be considered an independent \"word\". High tone syllables are usually heavy (having a long vowel or ending in a sonorant).\n\nThe syllable template in Haida is (C(C(C))V(V)(C(C)). In Skidegate Haida the two unaspirated stops /p t/ can occur in the syllable coda, while none of the other unaspirated or aspirated stops can. In Masset Haida the unaspirated stops and affricates which may be in the syllable coda are , in Alaskan Haida . Would-be final in loanwords may be nativized to zero.\n\nIn Skidegate Haida a long syllabic lateral may appear in VV position, e.g. ' \"sew\". Historically this developed from long ' after a lateral consonant, but a few Skidegate words retain ' in this position, e.g. ' \"inside\", \"\" \"mountain goat wool\". Syllabic resonants occur frequently in Masset Haida and occasionally in Kaigani Haida, but they are not present on the phonemic level.\n\nSeveral orthographies have been devised for writing Haida. The first alphabet was devised by the Alaska Native Language Center (ANLC) for Kaigani Haida in 1972, based on Tlingit orthographic conventions, and is still in use. The linguist John Enrico created another orthography for Skidegate and Masset Haida which introduced and as letters and did away with the distinction between upper and lower case, and this system is popular in Canada. Robert Bringhurst, for his publications on Haida literature, created an orthography without punctuation or numerals, and few apostrophes; and in 2008 the Skidegate Haida Immersion Program (SHIP) created another, which is the usual orthography used in Skidegate. Other systems have been used by isolated linguists. Haida consonants are represented as follows.\n\nIn ANLC orthography is used for in syllable-initial position, and a hyphen is used to distinguish consonant clusters from digraphs (e.g. ' contains the sequence /n/ followed by /g/ rather than the consonant /ŋ/). Bringhurst uses a raised dot for the same, '. The Enrico orthography uses (or when long) for the syllabic lateral in Skidegate Haida, e.g. \"\". Enrico uses a period for an \"unlinked consonant slot.\" are used for in Enrico's Skidegate orthography since they generally correspond to in the other dialects.\n\nThe following are how Haida vowels are written:\n\nEnrico (2003) uses for some instances of based on morphophonemics. Alaskan Haida also has a diphthong written . Enrico & Stuart (1996) use for the vowels that occur in nonsense syllables in songs. The Alaskan Haida orthography was updated in 2010 by Jordan Lachler.\n\nThe word classes in Haida are nouns, verbs, postpositions, demonstratives, quantifiers, adverbs, clitics, exclamations, replies, classifiers, and instrumentals. Unlike in English, adjectives and some words for people are expressed with verbs, e.g. ' \"(to be a) woman\", ' \"(to be) good\". Haida morphology is mostly suffixing. Prefixation is only used to form \"complex verbs\", made up of a nominal classifier or instrumental plus a bound root, for instance Skidegate ' \"pick up stick-object\" and ' \"pick up several (small objects) together, with tongs\", which share the root ' \"pick up\". Infixation occurs with some stative verbs derived from classifiers, for instance the classifier ' plus the stative suffix ' becomes '.\n\nThe definite article is suffixed '. Some speakers shorten this suffix to ' or '. Some nouns, especially verbal nouns ending in long vowels and loan words, take ' instead, often accompanied by shortening or eliding preceding '. Haida also has a partitive article ', referring to \"part of something or ... to one or more objects of a given group or category,\" e.g. ' 'he is making a boat (a member of the category of boats).' Partitive nouns are never definite, so the two articles never co-occur.\n\nPersonal pronouns occur in independent and clitic forms, which may each be in either agentive or objective form; first and second person pronouns also have separate singular and plural forms. The third person pronoun is only used for animates, though for possession ' (lit. \"this one\") may be used; after relational nouns and prepositions ' (lit. \"it, that place, there\") is used instead.\n\nNumber is not marked in most nouns, but is marked in certain cases in verbs. Relationship nouns do have a plural in with ' (or for many speakers '), e.g. ' \"my grandfathers\". A few verbs have suppletive plural forms, as in many other North American languages. In addition, Haida has a plural verb suffix ' (Skidegate) ' (Masset) ' / ' (Kaigani) that is used to indicate that some third person pronoun in the sentence is plural, and to mark plural subject in imperatives. The third person pronoun that is pluralized can have any grammatical function, e.g. ' \"I bought all their fish\" (Masset).\n\nMost nouns referring to family relationships have special vocative forms, e.g. ' (Alaskan) ' (Masset) \"grandfather!\"\n\nHaida uses so-called \"relational nouns\" referring to temporal and spatial relations in place of most prepositions or prepositional phrases in English. Many of these are formed with the suffix ', or in Alaskan Haida more often '. The updated orthography for Alaska Haida has changed the ' to '. For example, Haida ' / ' / ' \"surface\" likely comes from ' \"back (noun)\", and Alaskan Haida ' \"side facing away from the beach, towards the woods\" comes from the noun ' \"away from the beach, place in the woods\". These contrast with \"local nouns\", which refer to localities and do not occur with possessive pronouns, e.g. ' \"above, up\". Some local nouns have an optional prefix ' which does not have semantic value. Both relational and local nouns may take the areal suffix ' to refer to the entire area rather than a particular location, so for example ' means \"[at some place] on its surface\" while \"\" means \"its surface area\".\n\nHaida has a small class of true postpositions, some of which may be suffixed to relational nouns. The Alaskan postpositions ' \"to\" and ' \"from\" (Skidegate ', ') fuse to the preceding word. The Alaskan postposition of ' has been updated in the current Alaska Haida orthography to '. These also fuse with a preceding suffix ' to become ' and '. The updated orthography for Alaska Haida has changed the ' to '. Some postpositions have forms beginning with ' which are used in some common constructions without a preceding possessive pronoun, and translate into English as a pronoun plus \"it\", e.g. ' \"he's thinking about it\" (with ' for \"\" \"to, at\").\n\nHaida demonstratives are formed from the bases ' (close to speaker), ' (close to listener), ' (away from both), and ' (something previously mentioned), which when used independently are place demonstratives. These may be given the following suffixes to create other demonstratives: ' (singular object), ' (plural objects), ' (quantity or time), ' (place), ' (plural people), ' (area), and \"\" (manner).\n\nHaida verbs have three basic forms: the \"present\", the \"past\", and the \"inferential\" forms. The past and inferential forms are both used to refer to events in the past, but differ in evidentiality: the inferential marks that the speaker was informed of or inferred the event rather than having experienced it personally. The bare present form refer to present-tense events, while future is formed with the suffix ', using a present-form verb, e.g. ' \"he will go\". The interrogative past form, made from the inferential form by removing final \"\", is used in place of both past and inferential forms in sentences with question words.\n\nThere are four classes of verb stems:\n\nHabitual aspect uses the suffix ' in the present and inferential and ' in the past. Potential mood is marked with ' and hortative with the particle ' (in the same position as the tense suffixes). Imperatives are marked with the particle ' after the first phrase in the sentence, or ' after the verb word (the verb dropping final weak ' if present) if there is no non-verbal phrase. Verbs are negated with the negative suffix ', usually with the negative word ' \"not\" in sentence-head position. Verbs drop weak ' before this suffix, e.g. \"\" \"he is not doing it that way\".\n\nHaida uses instrumental prefixes, classificatory prefixes, and directional suffixes to derive verbs. Some verb stems, known as \"bound stems\", must occur with at least one such affix; for example \"\" \"strike once\" requires an instrumental prefix.\n\nHaida has a large number of classifiers (on the order of 475). These have a limited number of rhyme structures, which relate to each other ideophonically.\n\nNumerals are generally treated as verbs in Haida, e.g. ' \"I have eight children\" (literally \"my children are eight\"). For some types of objects, classificatory prefixes are used, e.g. ' \"two land otters\" (\"\" = small animal or fish).\n\nNouns and verbs that end in a vowel undergo glide formation (if the final vowel is high) or truncation (otherwise) before vowel-initial prefixes. Some vowel-initial suffixes cause nouns and verbs which are consonant-final and polysyllabic to undergo Final Syllable Shortening (FSS).\n\nIn Masset Haida, final short vowels in polysyllabic verbs are lengthened in sentence-final position: compare Masset ' to Skidegate ' \"Give it to me\".\n\nHaida clauses are verb-final. SOV word order is always possible, while OSV may also be used when the subject is more 'potent' than the object; thus Haida is a direct–inverse language. For example, a human is more potent than a horse, which is more potent than a wagon. Thus the Masset Haida sentence ' can only mean \"truly Bill likes the dog\", while ' can mean either \"truly the dog likes Bill\" or \"truly Bill likes the dog\". The determinants of potency are complex and include \"acquaintance, social rank, humanness, animacy.. number ... [and] gender was also important at least in the two southern dialects.\" The following groups are listed in descending order of potency: \"known single adult free humans; non-adult and/or enslaved and/or unknown and/or grouped humans; non-human higher animals; inanimates and lower organisms (fish and lower).\" Grammatical definiteness does not affect potency.\n\nPronouns are placed adjacent to the verb and cliticized to it. Their internal order is object–subject, or in causatives object-causee-subject, for example ' \"You told Bill to punch me / Bill told you to punch me\". Potency is also relevant for pronoun ordering when one pronoun is less potent, for example the indefinite pronoun ' in ' = ' 'she took some.' Sentences with ' \"someone\" or ' \"some people\" as the subject may be translated as passive sentences in English, for example \"\" \"he was seen (by more than one person)\", literally \"some people saw him\".\n\nClitic pronouns are used as complements of verbs, as inalienable possessives, with quantifiers, and in Skidegate Haida as the objects of some postpositions. Independent pronouns are used everywhere else. Agentive pronouns are marked and are only used as subjects of some verbs. Verbs taking agentive subjects are most common in the lexicon (about 69%), followed by those taking objective subjects (29%) and those that may take either (2%). Intransitive verbs of inherent states (e.g. \"be old\") take an objective subject, while most transitive verbs take agentive subjects (but cf. verbs like ' \"like\"). With some verbs that may take either, there may be a semantic difference involved, e.g. ' (Masset) which means \"refuse\" with agentive subject but \"not want\" with objective subject. Enrico (2003) argues that the agentive case indicates planning; thus Haida is essentially an active–stative language, though subject case is also variable in some transitive verbs.\n\nEnclitics are placed after the first phrase in the sentence, usually a noun phrase (except with the imperative clitic ' which follows a verb phrase). Independent pronouns are used instead of clitic pronouns when modified by a clitic, so for example ' \"he got well\" becomes ' \"he also got well\" when the clitic ' 'also, too' is added. The enclitics ' and ' follow other enclitics.\n\nFocus and less commonly topic are marked with the clitic ', placed after a sentence-initial constituent, e.g. ' (Skidegate) \"Bill saw Mary\" / \"Mary saw Bill\", ' \"That one, he was called 'qaagaa. Question words always take this enclitic, for example ' \"what?\", ' \"where?\", \"\" \"when?\".\n\nThere are multiple ways that Haida marks possession. Haida has obligatory possession, a common feature of native North American languages where certain nouns (in Haida, family relationship, body part, and \"relational\" nouns) must occur with a possessor and cannot stand alone. For example, one can say ' \"my mother\" but not *', though one may use a circumlocution like ' 'one who is a mother'. These nouns are possessed using the bound objective pronouns, which all precede the noun except ' 'one's own'. Included in the class of obligatorily possessed nouns are so-called \"relational nouns\" and postpositions, which generally translate to prepositions or prepositional phrases in English and refer to temporal and spatial relations.\n\nRelational nouns take some special third person possessive pronouns (' rather than '), e.g. ' \"in(side) it\" (lit. \"its interior\"). Non-obligatory possession nouns are possessed by putting them in definite form after the possessor (a noun or a bound objective pronoun) in partitive form, e.g. ' \"our knife\". An alternate construction when the possessor is a pronoun is to place an independent objective pronoun after the possessed noun, the latter in definite form, e.g. ' \"my house\". The independent objective pronouns also occur by themselves with possessive force, e.g. \"\" \"mine\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41496067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41496067", "title": "History of film technology", "text": "History of film technology\n\nThe history of film technology traces the development of film technology from the initial development of \"moving pictures\" at the end of 19th century to the present time. Motion pictures were initially exhibited as a fairground novelty and developed into one of the most important tools of communication and entertainment in the 20th century. Major developments in motion picture technology have included the adoption of synchronized motion picture sound, color motion picture film, and the adoption of digital film technologies to replace physical film stock at both ends of the production chain by digital image sensors and projectors.\n\nThe technology of film emerged mostly from developments and achievements in the fields of projection, lenses, photography and optics.\nEarly techniques that involve motion and/or projection include:\nLive projection of moving images occur in the camera obscura, a natural phenomenon that may have been used artistically since prehistory. The use of a lens in a camera obscura has been dated back to 1550. Mobile camera obscura devices were used since the early 17th century, first in tents and not much later in wooden boxes. The box-type camera would be adapted into a photographic camera in the 1820s and 1830s.\n\nIn or before 1659 the magic lantern was developed by Christiaan Huygens. It projected slides that were usually painted in color on glass. A 1659 sketch by Huygens indicates that moving images may have been part of the earliest screenings. Around 1790 multi-media phantasmagoria spectacles were developed. Rear projection, animated slides, multiple projectors (superimposition), mobile projectors (on tracks or handheld), projection on smoke, sounds, odors and even electric shocks were used to frighten audiences with a convincing ghost horror experience. In the 19th century several other popular magic lantern techniques were developed, including dissolving views and several types of mechanical slides that created dazzling abstract effects (chromatrope, et cetera) or that showed for instance falling snow or the planets and their moons revolving.\n\nThe basic stroboscopic principle that allowed the creation of motion pictures was discovered by Joseph Plateau in Belgium around December 1832 and published in January 1833. His invention - later known as the phénakisticope or fantascope - was a cardboard disc with slits through which the viewer could watch a rapid succession of sequential drawings (photography wasn't introduced yet) reflected in a mirror. If a phénakisticope disc spins fast enough it invisibly replaces each picture by the next one and the viewer sees figures in fluent motion. A very similar \"Stroboscope Disc\" was independently invented in Austria by Simon von Stampfer around the same time (probably some weeks later). Stampfer also mentioned several possible variations of his stroboscopic invention, including a cylinder (similar to the later zoetrope) as well as a long, looped strip of paper or canvas stretched around two parallel rollers (somewhat similar to film) and a theater-like frame (much like the later praxinoscope theatre).\n\nIn 1845, Francis Ronalds created an alternative technology – the first successful camera able to make continuous recordings of the varying indications of meteorological and geomagnetic instruments over time. The cameras were supplied to numerous observatories around the world and some remained in use until well into the 20th century.\nThe first motion sequence photographed in real-time, rather than consisting of a series of posed photographs, was created in the US in 1878 by British photographer Eadweard Muybridge. Under the sponsorship of Leland Stanford, he photographed a horse named Sallie Gardner in rapid motion by using a series of separate still cameras. The experiment took place on June 15 at Stanford's stock farm in Palo Alto, California, with the press present, and was meant to determine whether a galloping horse ever had all four feet off the ground at the same time. The cameras were arranged in a line parallel to the edge of the track and spaced 27 inches apart. Each camera shutter was triggered by a thread as the horse passed and each exposure was made in only one thousandth of a second. Originally the pictures were published as cards and plates. From 1879 to 1893 Muybridge also had silhouettes of his pictures painted onto glass discs to project the images onto a screen with a device he called a zoopraxiscope, which can be regarded as the first movie projector. His innovative process was an intermediate stage toward motion pictures and cinematography. Soon after the pictures were published, or at least since January 1879, there were several people who placed these in zoetropes to watch them in motion. These were most likely the very first viewings of photographic motion pictures that were recorded in real-time.\n\nÉtienne-Jules Marey invented a chronophotographic gun in 1882, which was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second, recording all the frames on the same picture. He used the chronophotographic gun for studying animals and human locomotion. \n\nAn early projector, along similar lines to Muybridge's zoopraxiscope, was built by Ottomar Anschütz in 1887. His Electrotachyscope used 24 images on a rotating glass disk. In 1894 his invention projected moving images in Berlin.\n\nAs a result of the work of Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey, inventors in the late 19th century began to realize that the making and showing of photographic 'moving pictures' of a more useful or even indefinite length was a practical possibility.\n\nThe first motion picture camera was invented by the Frenchman Louis Le Prince in the 1880s, while working in Leeds, England. Le Prince had been inspired by Muybridge's pioneering experiments, and he patented his first invention, a 16-lensed camera, in 1887. The first eight lenses would be triggered in rapid succession by an electromagnetic shutter on the sensitive film; the film would then be moved forward, allowing the other eight lenses to operate on the film. Although the camera was capable of 'capturing' motion, it was not a complete success because each lens photographed the subject from a slightly different viewpoint, with the result that foreground elements in the projected scene wove about relative to each other and to the background.\n\nIn May 1887, after much trial and error, Le Prince was finally able to develop and patent the first single-lensed motion picture camera in 1888. He used it to shoot the world's earliest known motion picture on film: \"Roundhay Garden Scene\", a short test photographed on October 14, 1888 in Roundhay, Leeds.\n\nLe Prince later used his camera to shoot trams and the horse-drawn and pedestrian traffic on Leeds Bridge (the movie was shot from Hicks the Ironmongers, now the British Waterways building, on the southeast side of the bridge; a blue plaque now marks the spot). He initially shot his motion pictures on gelatin or glass plates but later switched to the more suitable celluloid, using film 1.75 inches wide.\nIn Leeds in 1889, Le Prince presented the first purely photographic motion picture projection, using equipment he designed. His single-lensed projector used an electric arc lamp to project the images onto a white screen. He is regarded by many film historians as the father of motion pictures. \nAnother early pioneer, working at roughly the same time as Le Prince, was William Friese-Greene. He began to experiment with the use of oiled paper as a medium for displaying motion pictures in 1885 and by 1887 he was experimenting with the use of celluloid. In 1889, Friese-Greene took out a patent for a 'chronophotographic' camera. This was capable of taking up to ten photographs per second using perforated celluloid film. A report on the camera was published in the British \"Photographic News\" on February 28, 1890. He gave a public demonstration in 1890 of his device, but the low frame rate combined with the device's apparent unreliability made an unfavourable impression.\nEnglish anarchist and inventor Wordsworth Donisthorpe, filed for an early patent in 1876 for a film camera, which he named a \"kinesigraph.\"\nAt the time, the necessary materials were not yet available to produce a working motion picture camera, but in 1889, his interest in the possibility was revived when he heard about the successful experiments of Louis Le Prince, who was then working in Donsithorpe's home town of Leeds. In 1889 he took out a patent, jointly with William Carr Crofts, for a camera using celluloid roll film and a projector system; they then made a short film of the bustling traffic in London's Trafalgar Square.\nAnother, more successful apparatus was invented by the Scottish inventor and employee of Thomas Alva Edison, W. K. L. Dickson. His camera, called the Kinetograph, was patented in 1891 and took a series of instantaneous photographs on standard Eastman Kodak photographic emulsion coated on to a transparent celluloid strip 35 mm wide. The celluloid blocks were thinly sliced, then removed with heated pressure plates. After this, they were coated with a photosensitive gelatin emulsion.\n\nIn 1893 at the Chicago World's Fair, Thomas Edison revealed the 'Kinetoscope' to the public. The machine was contained within a large box, and only permitted the images to be viewed by one person at a time looking into it through a peephole, after starting the machine by inserting a coin. The parlours were supplied with film snippets photographed by Dickson, in Edison's \"Black Maria\" studio. These sequences recorded both mundane incidents, such as \"Fred Ott's Sneeze\", and entertainment acts, such as acrobats, music hall performers and boxing demonstrations. The Kinetoscope peep-show parlor first opened on April 14, 1894, and was the first commercial exhibition of film. Kinetoscope parlors soon spread successfully to Europe. Edison, however, never attempted to patent these instruments on the other side of the Atlantic, since they relied so greatly on previous experiments and innovations from Britain and Europe.\n\nThe Pleograph, invented by Polish emigre Kazimierz Prószyński in 1894 was another early camera. It also doubled up as a projector. The apparatus used a rectangle of celluloid with perforations between several parallel rows of images. Using an improved pleograph, Prószynski shot short films showing scenes of life in Warsaw, such as people skating in the park. Charles Francis Jenkins also exhibited his projector, the Phantoscope before an audience in June 1894.\n\nThe Eidoloscope, devised by Eugene Augustin Lauste for the Latham family, was demonstrated for members of the press on April 21, 1895 and opened to the paying public on May 20, in a lower Broadway store with films of the Griffo-Barnett prize boxing fight, taken from Madison Square Garden's roof on May 4. It was the first commercial projection.\n\nIn Lyon, Louis and Auguste Lumière perfected the Cinématographe, an apparatus that took, printed, and projected film. In late 1895 in Paris, father Antoine Lumière began exhibitions of projected films before the paying public, beginning the general conversion of the medium to projection. They quickly became Europe's main producers with their \"actualités\" like \"Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory\" and comic vignettes like \"The Sprinkler Sprinkled\" (both 1895). Even Edison, initially dismissive of projection, joined the trend with the Vitascope, a modified Jenkins' Phantoscope, within less than six months.\nA slightly earlier public motion-picture film presentation was made by Max and Emil Skladanowsky in Berlin, who projected with their apparatus \"Bioscop\", a flickerfree duplex construction, November 1 through 31, 1895. However, the equipment was cumbersome and its use was eventually discontinued.\n\nIn Britain, Robert W. Paul and Birt Acres both independently developed their own systems for projecting a moving image on to a screen. Acres presented his in January 1896, and Paul unveiled his more influential Theatrograph shortly after on 20 February, on exactly the same day the Lumieres' films would first be projected in London. The Theatrograph pioneered the ‘Maltese cross’ system that drove sprocket rollers to provide intermittent motion. After some demonstrations before scientific groups, he was asked to supply a projector and staff to the Alhambra Music Hall in Leicester Square, and he presented his first theatrical programme on 25 March 1896. His device was the prototype for the modern film projector and was sold across Europe.\n\nBy 1896, it had dawned on the Edison company that more money could be made by showing motion picture films with a projector to a large audience than exhibiting them in peep-show machines. The Edison company took up a projector developed by Armat and Jenkins, the \"Phantoscope\", which was renamed the Vitascope, and it joined various projecting machines made by other people to show the 480 mm width films being made by the Edison company and others in France and the UK.\n\nInitially, a lack of standardization meant that film producers used a variety of different film widths and projection speeds, but after a few years the 35-mm wide Edison film, and the 16-frames-per-second projection speed of the Lumière Cinématographe became the standard.\n\nBirt Acres designed the first camera for amateur use in 1898. He called it the 'Birtac Home Cinema', and it used a 17.5mm gauge. Its purpose, in his words, was 'to place animated photography in the reach of everyone'.\n\nBy the late 1890s, the first motion picture companies were established in the US, France, Britain and elsewhere.\n\nThe most successful motion picture company in the United States, with the largest production until 1900, was the American Mutoscope company. This was initially set up to exploit peep-show type films using designs made by W.K.L. Dickson after he left the Edison company in 1895. His equipment used 70 mm wide film, and each frame was printed separately onto paper sheets for insertion into their viewing machine, called the Mutoscope. The image sheets stood out from the periphery of a rotating drum, and flipped into view in succession.\n\nBesides American Mutoscope, there were also numerous smaller producers in the United States, and some of them established a long-term presence in the new century. American Vitagraph, one of these minor producers, built studios in Brooklyn, and expanded its operations in 1905.\nIn France, the Lumière company sent cameramen all round the world from 1896 onwards to shoot films, which were exhibited locally by the cameramen, and then sent back to the company factory in Lyon to make prints for sale to whomever wanted them. There were nearly a thousand of these films made up to 1901, nearly all of them actualities.\n\nBy 1898, Georges Méliès was the largest producer of fiction films in France, and from this point onwards his output was almost entirely films featuring trick effects, which were very successful in all markets. The special popularity of his longer films, which were several minutes long from 1899 onwards (while most other films were still only a minute long), led other makers to start producing longer films.\n\nIn 1900, Charles Pathé began film production under the Pathé-Frères brand, with Ferdinand Zecca hired to actually make the films. By 1905, Pathé was the largest film company in the world, a position it retained until World War I. Léon Gaumont began film production in 1896, with his production supervised by Alice Guy.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Birt Acres was one of the first to produce films as well as being the first travelling newsreel reporter. In 1894 he created a 70 mm format and filmed the Henley Royal Regatta. He went on to make some of Britain's first films with Robert W. Paul with a 35 mm movie camera, the Kineopticon, including \"Incident at Clovelly Cottage\", \"The Oxford and Cambridge University Boat Race\" and \"Rough Sea at Dover\".\n\nCharles Urban became managing director of the Warwick Trading Company in 1897, where he specialised in actuality film, including newsfilm of the Anglo-Boer War. In July 1903 he formed his own company, the Charles Urban Trading Company, moving to London's Wardour Street in 1908, the first film business to be located in what became the home of the British film industry. Mitchell and Kenyon was founded by Sagar Mitchell and James Kenyon in 1897, soon becoming one of the largest film producers in the United Kingdom. Other early pioneers include James Williamson, G.A. Smith and Cecil Hepworth, who in 1899, began turning out 100 films a year, with his company becoming the largest on the British scene.\n\nThe Babelsberg Studio near Berlin in Germany was the first large-scale film studio in the world, founded 1912, and the forerunner to Hollywood with its several establishments of large studios in the early 20th century.\n\nInitially, commercial screenings of motion-pictures for the public were put on in existing theatres and music halls as a novelty, but the main methods of exhibition quickly became either as an item on the programmes of variety theatres, or by traveling showmen in tent theatres, which they took around the fairs in country towns. It became the practice for the producing companies to sell prints outright to the exhibitors, at so much per foot, regardless of the subject. Typical prices initially were 15 cents a foot in the United States, and one shilling a foot in Britain. Hand-coloured films, which were being produced of the most popular subjects before 1900, cost 2 to 3 times as much per foot. There were a few producers, such as the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, who did not sell their films, but exploited them solely with their own exhibition units.\n\nThe first public motion-picture film presentation in the world was done by Max and Emil Skladanowsky at the Berlin Wintergarten theatre, who projected with their apparatus \"Bioscop\", a flickerfree duplex construction, from November 1 through 31, 1895.\nThe first theatres dedicated to motion-pictures were established at the turn of the century, soon becoming known as cinemas. The Vitascope Hall in New Orleans was opened in 1896 as one of the first such establishments. It showed two exhibitions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.\n\nAnother early establishment was the Islington Palace, originally built in 1869 as part of the Royal Agricultural Hall complex. The concert hall was converted into a full-time cinema in 1901, a year after it showed its first film.\n\nThe Nickelodeon was the first successful permanent theatre showing only films, and opened in Pittsburgh in 1905. By then there were enough films several minutes long available to fill a programme running for at least half an hour, and which could be changed weekly when the local audience became bored with it. Other exhibitors quickly followed suit, and within a couple of years there were thousands of these \"nickelodeons\" in operation worldwide.\n\nThe first person to demonstrate a natural-color motion picture system was British inventor Edward Raymond Turner, who applied for his patent in 1899, received it in 1900, and was able to show promising but very mechanically defective results in 1902.\n\nTurner's camera used a rotating disk of three color filters to photograph color separations on one roll of black-and-white film. A red, green or blue-filtered image was recorded on each successive frame of film. The finished film print was projected, three frames at a time, through the corresponding color filters.\n\nWhen Turner died in 1903, his financial backer at that time, pioneering film producer Charles Urban, passed on the development of the process to George Albert Smith, who by 1906 had developed a simplified version that he later named Kinemacolor. The Kinemacolor camera had red and green filters in the apertures of its rotating shutter, so that alternating red-filtered and green-filtered views of the subject were recorded on consecutive frames of the panchromatic black-and-white film. The Kinemacolor projector did the same thing in reverse, projecting the frames of the black-and-white print alternately through the red and green filters in its rotating shutter.\n\nBoth devices were operated at twice the usual frame rate to reduce the color flicker (technically known as \"color bombardment\") produced by non-simultaneous projection of the two color components, a defect which some viewers barely noticed but which others found obtrusive and headache-inducing. A related defect was the most obvious shortcoming of this process: because the two components had not been photographed at the same time, as pairs of frames, rapidly moving subjects did not adequately match up from one frame to the next when projected on the screen, resulting in color \"fringes\" or in extreme cases vividly colored \"ghosts\". A white dog wagging its tail in front of a dark background could appear to have several tails, variously red, green and white.\nThe first motion picture exhibited in Kinemacolor was an eight-minute short titled \"A Visit to the Seaside\", which was trade-shown in September 1908. The general public first saw Kinemacolor in a program of 21 short films shown on 26 February 1909 at the Palace Theatre in London. The process was first seen in the US on 11 December 1909, at an exhibition staged by Smith and Urban at Madison Square Garden in New York.\n\nKinemacolor released the first drama filmed in the process, \"Checkmated\", in 1910, and the first feature-length documentary, \"With Our King and Queen Through India\", in 1912. \nKinemacolor projectors were installed in some 300 cinemas in Britain, and 54 dramatic films were produced. Four dramatic short films were made in Kinemacolor in the US in 1912–1913, and one in Japan in 1914. However, the company was not a success, partly due to the expense of installing the special Kinemacolor projectors.\n\nA variant method was promoted by William Friese-Greene. He called his additive color system \"Biocolour\". It differed from Kinemacolor only in that the need for a filter-equipped projector was eliminated by staining alternate frames of the film itself with red and green dyes. An ordinary projector could therefore be used, if it would bear being cranked at a sufficient rate. Like Kinemacolor, Biocolour suffered from noticeable color flicker and from red and green fringing when the subject was in rapid motion.\n\nIn 1913, French film entrepreneur and inventor Léon Gaumont unveiled Chronochrome, a full-color additive system. The camera used three lenses with color filters to photograph red, green and blue color components simultaneously on consecutive frames of one strip of 35 mm black-and-white film. The projector had a corresponding triad of lenses. To reduce the strain imposed on the film as the mechanism in each device pulled it down three frames at a time, frame height was reduced from the usual four film perforations to three, resulting in a widescreen image format identical with the modern 16:9 aspect ratio.\n\nChronochrome's color quality was impressive, as surviving specimens attest, and because the three frames were exposed and projected simultaneously, Kinemacolor's color bombardment and color fringes around moving objects were avoided. However, because the camera's three lenses could not all photograph the scene from exactly the same viewpoint, subjects that were too near the camera would exhibit color fringes if the registration of the three projected images was optimized for the background of the scene, and vice versa. A method of notching the prints to trigger automatic adjustment of the projection optics was invented, but expert supervision of the presentation was still a requisite. Light loss due to the color filters and the constrained dimensions of the projection lenses resulted in an image that was too dim for showing in a large auditorium unless a highly reflective metalized screen or rear-projection onto a translucent screen was used, and either solution created a \"hot spot\" that made the views from the side sections of the auditorium very unsatisfactory. The films were seldom screened outside of Gaumont's own cinemas and the system soon fell into disuse.\n\nAfter experimenting from 1915 to 1921 with additive color systems that filmed and projected the two color components simultaneously, rather than in rapid alternation (thereby eliminating Kinemacolor's color flicker and false color fringes around rapidly moving objects), the Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation developed a subtractive color print process. As in its last additive system, the camera had only one lens but used a beam splitter that allowed red and green-filtered images to be photographed simultaneously on adjacent frames of a single strip of black-and-white 35 mm film, which ran through the camera at twice the normal rate. By skip-frame printing from the negative, two prints were made, on film stock with half the normal base thickness. They were chemically toned (i.e., the silver particles forming the black-and-white images were proportionally replaced by coloring matter) to colors roughly complementary to the filter colors (red for the green-filtered images and vice versa), as subtractive color reproduction requires. They were then cemented together, base to base, into a single strip of film. No special projection equipment was needed.\n\nThe first publicly shown film using this process was \"The Toll of the Sea\" (1922) starring Anna May Wong. Perhaps the most ambitious all-Technicolor feature was \"The Black Pirate\" (1926), starring and produced by Douglas Fairbanks.\n\nIn 1928, the system was refined by the adoption of dye imbibition, which allowed for the transferring of dyes from both color matrices into a single one-sided print, thus eliminating the complication of attaching two prints back to back and allowing multiple prints to be created from a single pair of matrices.\n\nTechnicolor's system was popular for a number of years, but it was an expensive process: shooting cost three times as much as black-and-white photography and printing costs were also much higher. By 1932, color photography in general had nearly been abandoned by the major studios, but then Technicolor introduced a new process which recorded all three primary colors. Utilizing a dichroic beam splitter sandwiched between two 45-degree prisms in the form of a cube, light from the lens was split into two paths to expose three black-and-white films (two of them in bipack), one each to record the densities for red, green and blue.\n\nThe three negatives were printed to gelatin matrix films, which were processed with a selectively hardening developer, treated to remove the silver, and hot-washed to leave only a gelatin relief of the images. A receiver print, consisting of a 50% density silver print of the black-and-white negative for the green component, and including the soundtrack and frame lines, was made and treated with dye mordants to aid in the imbibition process (the inclusion of a \"black\" image was discontinued in the early 1940s). The matrix for each color was soaked in its complementary dye (yellow, cyan, or magenta), then each in succession was brought into high-pressure contact with the receiver, which imbibed and held the dyes, thus reproducing a nearly complete spectrum of color, unlike previous two-color processes. The first animation film to use the three-color (also called three-strip) system was Walt Disney's \"Flowers and Trees\" (1932), which introduced it to an enthusiastic public. The first short live-action film was \"La Cucaracha\" (1934), and the first all-color feature in \"New Technicolor\" was \"Becky Sharp\" (1935).\n\nThe proliferation of television in the early 1950s contributed to a heavy mid-century push for color within the film industry. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number had risen to over 50 percent. The color boom was aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near-monopoly on the medium. The last stand of black-and-white films made by or released through the major Hollywood studios came in the mid-1960s, after which the use of color film for all productions was effectively mandatory and exceptions were only rarely and grudgingly made.\n\nInitially, there were technical difficulties in synchronizing images with sound. However, there was still significant interest in motion pictures for films to be produced without sound. The era from the 1890s to the late 1920s, is commonly referred to as the silent era of film. To enhance the viewers' experience, silent films were commonly accompanied by live musicians and sometimes sound effects and even commentary spoken by the showman or projectionist. In most countries, intertitles came to be used to provide dialogue and narration for the film.\n\nExperimentation with sound film technology, both for recording and playback, was virtually constant throughout the silent era, but the twin problems of accurate synchronization and sufficient amplification had been difficult to overcome (Eyman, 1997). In 1926, Hollywood studio Warner Bros. introduced the \"Vitaphone\" system, producing short films of live entertainment acts and public figures and adding recorded sound effects and orchestral scores to some of its major features.\n\nDuring late 1927, Warners released \"The Jazz Singer\", which was mostly silent but contained what is generally regarded as the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film. The early sound-on-disc processes such as Vitaphone were soon superseded by sound-on-film methods such as Fox Movietone, DeForest Phonofilm, and RCA Photophone. The trend convinced the largely reluctant industrialists that \"talking pictures\", or \"talkies\", were the future. A lot of attempts were made before the success of \"The Jazz Singer\", that can be seen in the List of film sound systems.\n\nDigital cinematography, the process of capturing film images using digital image sensors rather than through film stock, has largely replaced analog film technology. As digital technology has improved in recent years, this practice has become dominant. Since the mid 2010s most of the movies across the world are captured as well as distributed digitally.\n\nMany vendors have brought products to market, including traditional film camera vendors like Arri and Panavision, as well as new vendors like RED, Blackmagic, Silicon Imaging, Vision Research and companies which have traditionally focused on consumer and broadcast video equipment, like Sony, GoPro, and Panasonic.\n\nCurrent digital film cameras with 4k output are approximately equal to 35mm film in their resolution and dynamic range capacity, however, digital film still has a slightly different look to analog film. Some filmmakers and photographers still prefer to use analogue film to achieve the desired results.\n\nDigital cinema, the use of digital technology to distribute or project motion pictures has also largely replaced the historical use of reels of motion picture film, such as 35 mm film. Whereas traditional film reels had to be shipped to movie theaters, a digital movie can be distributed to cinemas in a number of ways: over the Internet or dedicated satellite links or by sending hard drives or optical discs such as Blu-ray discs. Digital movies are projected using a digital projector instead of a conventional film projector. Digital cinema is distinct from high-definition television and is not dependent on using television or high-definition video standards, aspect ratios, or frame rates.

An index case will sometimes achieve the status of a \"classic\" case study in the literature, as did Phineas Gage, the first known person to exhibit a definitive personality change as a result of a brain injury.\n\nThe index case may or may not indicate the source of the disease, the possible spread, or which reservoir holds the disease in between outbreaks, but may bring awareness of an emerging outbreak. Earlier cases may or may not be found and are labeled primary or coprimary, secondary, tertiary, etc. The term primary case can only apply to infectious diseases that spread from human to human, and refers to the person who first brings a disease into a group of people. In epidemiology, the term is often misused by both scientists and journalists alike to refer to the individual known or believed to have been the first infected or source of the resulting outbreak in a population as the index case, but such would technically refer to the primary case.\n\n\"Patient Zero\" was used to refer to the supposed source of HIV outbreak in the United States, but the term has been expanded into general usage to refer to an individual identified as the first carrier of a communicable disease in a population (the primary case), or the first incident in the onset of a catastrophic trend. In some cases, a known or suspected patient zero may be informally referred to as an index case for the purpose of a scientific study, such as the one-year-old boy who is thought to be the source of the largest Ebola virus outbreak in history.\n\nIn genetics, the index case is the case of the original patient (ie. \"propositus\" or \"proband\") that stimulates investigation of other members of the family to discover a possible genetic factor.\n\nThe term can also be used in non-medical fields to describe the first individual affected by something negative that since propagated to others, such as the first user on a network infected by malware.\n\nIn the early years of the AIDS epidemic, a \"patient zero\" transmission scenario was compiled by Dr. William Darrow and colleagues at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This epidemiological study showed how \"patient zero\" had infected multiple partners with HIV, and they, in turn, transmitted it to others and rapidly spread the virus to locations all over the world (Auerbach et al., 1984). The CDC identified Gaëtan Dugas as a carrier of the virus from Europe to the United States and spreading it to other men he encountered at gay bathhouses.\n\nJournalist Randy Shilts subsequently wrote about Patient Zero, based on Darrow's findings, in his 1987 book \"And the Band Played On\", which identified Patient Zero as Gaëtan Dugas. Dugas was a flight attendant who was sexually promiscuous in several North American cities, according to Shilts' book. He was vilified for several years as a \"mass spreader\" of HIV, and seen as the original source of the HIV epidemic among homosexual men. Four years later, Darrow repudiated the study's methodology and how Shilts had represented its conclusions.\n\nA 2007 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America by Michael Worobey and Dr. Arthur Pitchenik claimed that, based on the results of genetic analysis, current North American strains of HIV probably moved from Africa to Haiti and then entered the United States around 1969, probably through a single immigrant. However, Robert Rayford died in St. Louis, Missouri, of complications from AIDS in 1969, and most likely became infected before 1966, so there were prior carriers of HIV strains in North America.\n\nThe phrase \"patient zero\" is now used in the media to refer to the primary case for infectious disease outbreaks, as well as for computer virus outbreaks, and, more broadly, as the source of ideas or actions that have far-reaching consequences.\n\nDavid Heymann, infectious-disease epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, has questioned the importance of finding patient zero and has said: \"Finding patient zero may be important in some instances, but only if they are still alive and spreading the disease. And more often than not, especially in large disease outbreaks, they're not.\"\n\n\nThe term is used to identify the first computer or user to be infected with malware on a network, which then infected other systems.\n\nMonica Lewinsky has described herself as the \"patient zero\" of online harassment, meaning that she was the first person to receive widespread public harassment via the internet.\n\nThe thirteenth season of the WNYC radio series \"Radiolab\" included an hour-long segment on patient zero.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42752864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42752864", "title": "Infrarealism", "text": "Infrarealism\n\nInfrarealism is a poetic movement founded in Mexico City in 1975 by a group of twenty young poets, including Roberto Bolaño, Mario Santiago Papasquiaro, José Vicente Anaya, Rubén Medina and José Rosas Ribeyro.\n\nThe Infrarealists, also known as “infras”, took for their motto a phrase from the Chilean painter Roberto Matta: “Blow the brains out of the cultural establishment”. Rather than a defined style, the movement was characterised by the pursuit of a free and personal poetry, representative of its members’ attitude towards life on the fringes of conventional society, in a similar manner to the Beat Generation of the 1950s.\n\nThe origin of the phrase is French. The intellectual Emmanuel Berl attributes it to one of the founders of Surrealism, the writer and political activist Philippe Soupault (1897-1990), who was also one of the driving forces behind Dadaism. According to Bolaño, however, the name was originally coined in the 1940s by Roberto Matta, after André Breton expelled him from the Surrealists. Cast out, Matta became an “Infrarealist”, and the only one up until the term's rebirth as a literary movement. A third account for the name’s origin can be traced back to Russian writer Georgy Gurevich's sci-fi novella \"Infra Dragonis\", originally published in 1959, and mentioned by Bolaño in the first Infrarealist manifesto.\n\nThe initial phase of Infrarealism, its most important, lasted until the departure of Papasquiaro and Bolaño to Europe in 1977, who were the initiators and primary leaders of the movement. However, on Papasquiario's return to Mexico City in 1979, the movement continued once more under his leadership until his death in 1998. At present, the movement is maintained by a mix of new and original members.\n\nIn 1968, at a time when the future Infrarealist poets were still children and adolescents, the so-called Dirty War began to take shape in Mexico during the presidency of Gustavo Díaz Ordaz (Institutional Revolutionary Party, 1964-1970). Amongst its principal consequences was the Tlatelolco Massacre in the Ciudad Universitaria of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where an estimated 300 to 400 students and civilians were murdered by military and police. Roberto Bolaño, 15-years-old, arrived in Mexico City from Chile with his family this same year. \n\nIn 1970, Luis Echeverría Álvarez (Institutional Revolutionary Party, 1970-1976) took up presidency in Mexico. He was the ex-Secretariat of the Interior in the government of Díaz Ordaz, who was considered by the majority of the Mexican population as one of the principal culprits of the Dirty War. To recapture Mexico’s youth, the new government set up a series of cultural scholarships, in addition to the creation of artistic and cultural workshops in universities and public institutions. Some of these were run by renowned writers such as Augusto Monterroso and Alejandro Aura. The Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the UNAM organised prose and poetry workshops and published the \"Punto de Partida\" magazine through the Department of Cultural Diffusion, which also ran prose, poetry, drama and essay workshops. Further workshops were held at the Metropolitan Autonomous University (UAM), courses run at the Casa del Lago cultural centre, and scholarships granted to study literature at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (National Institute of Fine Arts).\n\nInfrarealism emerged at the end of Luis Echeverría’s government in the midst of this effervescence of literary workshops in Mexico City, which were allowing many young people to begin to develop as poets and novelists. Determined to create a new literary movement based on expressive freedom, the liveliness of language and the breaking of conventions, Roberto Bolaño and Mario Santiago Papasquiaro began to meet with other friends and poets they considered fit for the project.\n\nAccording to the Chilean writer Carlos Chimal, president Luis Echeverría’s measures to promote cultural activity in the country polarised Mexico’s artistic society into “two worlds: high culture and popular culture, and there was no way that the two would touch”. The first of these worlds referred to artists who were granted scholarships or received benefits in some way from the Institutional Revolutionary Party's government – among them, for example, José Luis Cuevas and Fernando Benítz. For the Infrarealists, this group also included writers and intellectuals of world renown, such as Octavio Paz or Carlos Monsiváis, who, despite not needing Echeverría's direct support, cultivated a dedicated readership, ran important literary magazines, and also benefited from tax revenues. At the other extreme was the world of popular culture, which the Infrarealists associated with the left-wing revolution and was made up of artists that opposed the buying and selling of talent. While members of the first group sought to identify themselves with Octavio Paz, members of the second were closer to the poet Efraín Huerta. The Mexican writer Carmen Boullosa, a contemporary of the Infrarealists, agrees that both groups were exclusive, and recalls that the only poets who traversed between the two groups were Juan Pascoe and Verónica Volkow, a friend of Bolaño and granddaughter of Trotsky. Despite this, Boullosa maintains that the two groups were not entirely dissimilar.\n\nRather than for their own readings, the Infrarealists were known for their sabotaging of the readings, book launches, awards ceremonies and general literary activities of poets belonging to this world of “high culture”. The first of these sabotages took place prior to the movement’s foundation. Towards the end of 1973, Mario Santiago Papasquiaro and his friend Ramón Méndez attempted to throw Juan Bañuelos out of his own poetry workshop in the Department of Cultural Diffusion at UNAM by acquiring the signatures of participants; though in the end it was them who were thrown out.\n\nThe Infrarealists planned these acts in meetings. They sabotaged the events of different writers, including Octavio Paz himself. At the beginning of 1976, they sabotaged a reading by David Huerta, son of Efraín Huerta. While they got along well with his father, they considered David a privileged author who was destined to succeed under the sheltered protection of his surname. Only Bolaño participated in Huerta’s sabotaging. He later distanced himself from these acts, though still asked friends for details after the acts were carried out. Years later, Carmen Boullosa confessed to having been afraid the Infrarealists would sabotage the prize ceremony where she was to receive the Salvador Novo scholarship, awarded to those under 21, which Darío Galicia had also obtained the year before.\n\nOther poets began to both fear and hate them for these attitudes. They treated them as arrogant and disrespectful, and managed to isolate them from the established publications of the time. In 1975, in the \"La cultura en México\" supplement of \"Siempre!\" magazine, edited by Carlos Monsiváis, a number of columns appeared in which a young Héctor Aguilar Camín, José Joaquin Blanco and Enrique Krauze spoke of a drop in standard in contemporary Mexican literature, which they viewed as resulting from socialist fashion, excessive sexuality and the appearance of so many new, novice writers. Blanco began to explicitly criticise the Infrarealists in these columns, and they confronted him directly, though this time with Bolaño in tow.\n\nIn mid-1976, after Octavio Paz left \"Plural\" magazine due to political problems in what became known as the \"Excélsior coup”,\nRobert Rodríguez Baños was named as the magazine’s director and the Infrarealists once again had the opportunity to publish in established magazines. In October of the same year, in \"Plural\" number 61, Mario Santiago Papasquiaro published a review and translation of poems by the beat poet and novelist Richard Brautigan. Then, in December, in number 63, the magazine published \"Seis jóvenes infrarrealistas mexicanos\" (\"Six Young Mexican Infrarealists\"), with editing and introduction from Papasquairo and featuring Darío Galicia, Mara Larrosa, Rubén Medina, Cuauthémoc Méndez, José Peguero and Papasquairo himself. In January 1977, Roberto Bolaño was published in number 64.\n\nThe Infrarealists also published their own anthology in 1976, \"Pájaro de calor, ocho poetas infrarrealistas\" (\"Bird of Heat, Eight Infrarealist Poets\"), which contained a prologue by the Spanish poet and journalist Juan Cervera Sanchís. Based in Mexico, he was a regular of Café La Habana, where Bolaño and Papasquiaro held their Infrarealist meetings, and sympathised with the youthful energy of the infras.\n\nShortly before the publication of \"Pájaro de calor\", and made clear in a poem of said publication, Bolaño’s girlfriend Lisa Johnson broke up with him. This was one of the main reasons for Bolaño’s departure to Barcelona, where his mother had been living since leaving Mexico in the mid-1970s. Before leaving, however, he reached an agreement with Editorial Extemporáneos to publish \"Muchachos desnudos bajo el arcoiris de fuego. Once jóvenes poetas latinoamericanos\" (\"Naked Boys Under the Rainbow of Fire. Eleven Young Latin American Poets\"), an anthology of poems featuring Luis Suardíaz, Hernán Lavín Cerda, Jorge Pimentel, Orlando Guillén, Beltrán Morales, Fernando Nieto Cadena, Julián Gómez, Enrique Verástegui, Mario Santiago Papasquairo, Bruno Montané and Bolaño himself. Published in July 1979, the book is prefaced by Miguel Donoso Pareja, contains a piece by Efraín Huerta, and was the first from that era of Infrarealists to be paid for entirely by the publisher, rather than themselves.\n\nRoberto Bolaño left Mexico in 1977, shortly followed by Bruno Montané, who he would meet up with again in Barcelona. Mario Santiago Papasquiaro, on the other hand, went to Paris and Israel for a while. Rubén Medina and José Peguero, trying to regroup the infras who had remained in Mexico City and at the same time as a symbolic act of farewell, managed the publication of a single issue of the magazine \"Correspondencia Infra\" in October/November of that year. The magazine had a circulation of five thousand copies, of which very few original copies remain, and includes the \"Manifiesto Infrarrealista\" (\"Infrarealist Manifesto\"), written by Bolaño, and a poem by Papasquiaro titled \"Consejos de un discípulo de Marx a un fanático de Heidegger\" (\"Advice from a disciple of Marx to a Heidegger fanatic\"). Written in the days when Papasquiaro frequented the Alejandro Aura’s workshop in Casa del Lago, the poem served as inspiration for the title of the first novel by his friend Bolaño, now living in Spain: \"Consejos de un discípulo de Morrison a un fanático de Joyce\" (\"Advice from a disciple of Morrison to a Joyce fanatic\"), written in collaboration with A. G. Porta. The magazine’s poems were characterised by their stylistic variety.\n\nVarious other Infrarealists decided to leave Mexico City in the years following the departure of Bolaño, Papasquiaro and Montané. Only some continued with literary careers, although the majority dedicated themselves to artistic activities. Rubén Medina went to study literature in the United States; Harrington returned to Chile to study film; Gelles Lebrija went to live in Tijuana; Piel Divina to Paris; the Méndez brothers returned to their hometown Morelia, where they worked in journalism, and for a time as bakers; José Vicente Anaya dedicated himself to travelling around Mexico for four years; Lorena de la Rocha chose classical music composition and theatre; and the Larrosa sisters stayed in Mexico City, with Vera devoting herself to dance and theatre, and Mara to painting.\n\nThough the first phase of the movement ended with Bolaño and Papasquario’s departure to Europe in 1977, when Papasquario returned to Mexico City in 1979 he began to meet up with both old friends and new Infrarealists. Between April 1980 and February 1981, poems from this new group of Infraealists appeared in three issues of \"Le Prosa\" magazine, edited by Orlando Guillén. The sabotages also continued through the 80s, with Octavio Paz the victim of one in January 1980 at an event called the “Meeting of Generations” in the UNAM bookshop.\n\nBetween November 1984 and July 1990, the Infrarealists published a poetry pamphlet titled \"Calandria de tolvaneras\", which also included poems from older members like Roberto Bolaño and Bruno Montané. Between March 1992 and January 1993, various Infrarealists were published in several issues of \"Zonaeropuerto\" magazine, which was also edited by Orlando Guillén. In March 1992 they published the magazine \"La zorra vuelve al gallinero\", with two further issues in 2000 and 2002. The later issues, however, were without Papasquairo, who died in 1998. A decade after his death, Mario Raúl Guzman and Rebeca López, Papasquario’s widow, published \"Jeta de santo. Antología poética 1974-1977\", which compiled 161 of Papasquario’s poems.\n\nBolaño undoubtedly achieved the greatest international prestige out of the older Infrarealists, establishing himself as a novelist in Barcelona and publishing numerous works for Editorial Anagrama. The standout successes of these publications were The Savage Detectives, a novel which won Spain’s Premio Herralde and was directly inspired by his life with the Infrarealists in Mexico City; and 2666, which won awards in Spain, Chile and the United States and was also set in Mexico.\n"}

The character appeared in the 18th-century Chinese detective and \"gong'an\" crime novel \"Di Gong An\". After Robert van Gulik came across it in an antiquarian book store in Tokyo, he translated the novel into English and then used the style and characters to write his own original Judge Dee historical mystery stories.\n\nThe series is set in Tang Dynasty China and deals with criminal cases solved by the upright and shrewd Judge Dee, who as county magistrate in the Chinese imperial legal system was both the investigating magistrate and judge.\n\nThe Judge Dee character is based on the historical figure Di Renjie (c. 630–c. 700), magistrate and statesman of the Tang court. During the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) in China, a \"folk novel\" was written set in former times, but filled with anachronisms. Van Gulik found in the 18th century \"Di Gong An\" (Chinese:狄公案 Pinyin: dí gōng àn, lit. \"Cases of Judge Dee\") an original tale dealing with three cases simultaneously, and, which was unusual among Chinese mystery tales, a plot that for the most part lacked an overbearing supernatural element which could alienate Western readers. He translated it into English and had it published in 1949 under the title \"Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee\".\n\nThis gave van Gulik the idea of writing his own novels, set with the similar Ming anachronisms, but using the historical character. Van Gulik was careful in writing the main novels to deal with cases wherein Dee was newly appointed to a city, thereby isolating him from the existing lifestyle and enabling him to maintain an objective role in the books. Van Gulik's novels and stories made no direct reference to the original Chinese work, and so \"Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee\" is not considered to be part of the Judge Dee series.\n\nInitially Dee is assisted only by his faithful clerk, Sergeant Hoong, an old family retainer. However, in \"The Chinese Gold Murders\", which describes Dee's initial appointment and first criminal cases, the judge encounters two highwaymen, euphemistically called \"men of the greenwood\", Ma Joong and Chiao Tai, who attempt to rob him but are so impressed with his character that they give up their criminal careers and join his retinue on the spot. (This encounter is recounted in a short flashback passage in the original \"Di Gong An\", taking place when the two are already long-serving loyal members of his retinue). A little later, in \"The Chinese Lake Murders\", a third criminal, Tao Gan, an itinerant confidence trickster and swindler, similarly joins. Judge Dee ends his career being promoted to the position of senior Metropolitan Judge in the capital, and his assistants obtain official ranks in the Army and civil service.\n\nVan Gulik also wrote a series of newspaper comics about Judge Dee in 1964-1967, which totalled 19 adventures. The first four were regular balloon strips, but the later 15 had the more typically Dutch textblock under the pictures.\n\nJudge Dee, naturally, is responsible for deciding sentences as well as assessing guilt or innocence, although van Gulik notes in the stories that all capital punishments must be referred to and decided by officials in the capital. One of the sentences he frequently has to deal with is slow slicing; if he is inclined to mercy, he orders the final, fatal, cut to be made first, thus rendering the ceremony anticlimactic.\n\nSeveral other authors have created stories based on Van Gulik's Judge Dee character.\n\n\nThe following novels and short stories were published in English by van Gulik. The short story collection \"Judge Dee at Work\" (published in 1967) contains a \"Judge Dee Chronology\" detailing Dee's various posts in specific years and stories set in these times. Van Gulik's last two books, \"Poets and Murder\" and \"Necklace and Calabash\", were not listed in the chronology, as they were written after \"Judge Dee at Work\", but they are both set in the time when Judge Dee was the magistrate in Poo-yang.\n\nBy the author (not yet translated into English)\n\n\nBy the author Zhu Xiao Di\n\nBy the author Sven Roussel\n\nBy authors Eleanor Cooney & Daniel Alteri\n\nBy Lin Qianyu (林千羽)\n\nBy the author Hock G. Tjoa\n\nThe stories have been adapted into comic strips by Dutch artists Fritz Kloezeman between 1964 and 1969 and Dick Matena in 2000. \n\nJudge Dee has been adapted for television twice in English.\n\nSome of Robert van Gulik's Judge Dee stories have been adapted for Chinese TV by CCTV. As of 2012, four different DVD series are available with one series so far with English subtitles. CCTV produced series in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. The series from 2010, entitled \"Detective Di Renjie\" has been produced on DVD by Tai Seng entertainment with English subtitles.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It forms from snow pack and runoff on the south-western slopes of the Black Range at in Grant County. It flows southward into a small endorheic basin east of Deming, New Mexico in Luna County. The uplands watershed are administered by the US Forest Service, while the land in the Mimbres Valley is mostly privately owned. The upper reaches of the river are perennial. The river flows south from the Black Range and the surface flow of the river dissipates in the desert north of Deming, but the river bed and storm drainage continue eastward, any permanent flow remaining underground. The Mimbres River Basin has an area of about 13,000 km² (5,140 mi²) and extends slightly into northern Chihuahua.\n\nA wide diversity of species (37 species; excluding arthropods other than crustaceans) are of great conservation concern. Eighteen species (49%) are classified as \"vulnerable, imperiled, or critically imperiled\" statewide as well as nationally. Additionally 13 species are classified as \"vulnerable, imperiled, or critically imperiled\" in the state although they are secure nationally. Birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles are also of concern within the riparian, ephemeral and terrestrial habitats.\n\nThe use of water from the Mimbres River is still a matter of contention.\n\nThe Mimbres Basin supported the prehistoric Mimbres Culture, which was part of the larger Mogollon culture. The culture developed from around 200 to 1000 CE, known as the pithouse period. During this time the use of pottery increased and there was a greater dependence on agriculture throughout the Mogollon area. This agriculture depended more and more upon irrigation from the perennial and storm flow of the Mimbres River. In the later part of the pithouse period distinctive Mimbres pottery black-on-white designs grew more complex and ornate. Villages and irrigation complexes grew larger, and large kivas were built. These community ritual constructions were destroyed around 900 CE in huge ceremonial fires. This marked a major transition in social and ritual practices.\n\n\n"}

The earliest known applications of technology to music was prehistoric peoples' use of a tool to hand-drill holes in bones to make simple flutes. Ancient Egyptians developed stringed instruments, such as harps, lyres and lutes, which required making thin strings and some type of peg system for adjusting the pitch of the strings. Ancient Egyptians also used wind instruments such as double clarinets and percussion instruments such as cymbals. In Ancient Greece, instruments included the double-reed aulos and the lyre. Numerous instruments are referred to in the Bible, including the horn, pipe, lyre, harp, and bagpipe. During Biblical times, the cornet, flute, horn, organ, pipe, and trumpet were also used. During the Middle Ages, hand-written music notation was developed to write down the notes of religious Plainchant melodies; this notation enabled the Catholic church to disseminate the same chant melodies across its entire empire.\n\nDuring the Renaissance music era, the printing press was invented, which made it much easier to mass-produce music (which had previously been hand-copied). This helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. During the Baroque era (1600–1750), technologies for keyboard instruments developed, which led to improvements in the designs of pipe organs and harpsichords, and the development of a new keyboard instrument in about 1700, the piano. In the Classical era (1750–1820), Beethoven added new instruments to the orchestra to create new sounds, such as the piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussion in his Ninth Symphony. During the Romantic music era (c. 1810 to 1900), one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of relatively inexpensive sheet music, which amateur middle class music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other instruments. In the 19th century, new instruments such as piston valve-equipped cornets, saxophones, euphoniums, and Wagner tubas were added to the orchestra. Many of the mechanical innovations developed for instruments in the 19th century, notably on the piano, brass and woodwinds continued to be used in the 20th and early 21st century.\n\nFindings from paleolithic archaeology sites suggest that prehistoric people used carving and piercing tools to create instruments. Archeologists have found Paleolithic flutes carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced. The Divje Babe flute, carved from a cave bear femur, is thought to be at least 40,000 years old. Instruments such as the seven-holed flute and various types of stringed instruments, such as the Ravanahatha, have been recovered from the Indus Valley Civilization archaeological sites. India has one of the oldest musical traditions in the world—references to Indian classical music (\"marga\") are found in the Vedas, ancient scriptures of the Hindu tradition. The earliest and largest collection of prehistoric musical instruments was found in China and dates back to between 7000 and 6600 BC.\n\nIn prehistoric Egypt, music and chanting were commonly used in magic and rituals, and small shells were used as whistles. Evidence of Egyptian musical instruments dates to the Predynastic period, when funerary chants played an important role in Egyptian religion and were accompanied by clappers and possibly the flute. The most reliable evidence of instrument technologies dates from the Old Kingdom, when technologies for constructing harps, flutes and double clarinets were developed. Percussion instruments, lyres and lutes were used by the Middle Kingdom. Metal cymbals were used by ancient Egyptians. In the early 21st century, interest in the music of the pharaonic period began to grow, inspired by the research of such foreign-born musicologists as Hans Hickmann. By the early 21st century, Egyptian musicians and musicologists led by the musicology professor Khairy El-Malt at Helwan University in Cairo had begun to reconstruct musical instruments of Ancient Egypt, a project that is ongoing.\n\nThe Indus Valley civilization has sculptures that show old musical instruments, like the seven-holed flute. Various types of stringed instruments and drums have been recovered from Harappa and Mohenjo Daro by excavations carried out by Sir Mortimer Wheeler.\n\nAccording to the Scriptures, Jubal was the father of harpists and organists (Gen. 4:20–21). The harp was among the chief instruments and the favorite of David, and it is referred to more than fifty times in the Bible. It was used at both joyful and mournful ceremonies, and its use was \"raised to its highest perfection under David\" (1 Sam. 16:23). Lockyer adds that \"It was the sweet music of the harp that often dispossessed Saul of his melancholy (1 Sam. 16:14–23; 18:10–11). When the Jews were captive in Babylon they hung their harps up and refused to use them while in exile, earlier being part of the instruments used in the Temple (1 Kgs. 10:12). Another stringed instrument of the harp class, and one also used by the ancient Greeks, was the lyre. A similar instrument was the lute, which had a large pear-shaped body, long neck, and fretted fingerboard with head screws for tuning. Coins displaying musical instruments, the Bar Kochba Revolt coinage, were issued by the Jews during the Second Jewish Revolt against the Roman Empire of 132–135 AD. \nIn addition there was the psaltery, another stringed instrument which is referred to almost thirty times in Scripture. According to Josephus, it had twelve strings and was played with a quill, not with the hand. Another writer suggested that it was like a guitar, but with a flat triangular form and strung from side to side.\n\nAmong the wind instruments used in the biblical period were the cornet, wood flute, horn, organ, pipe, and early trumpet. There were also silver trumpets and the double oboe. Werner concludes that from the measurements taken of the trumpets on the Arch of Titus in Rome and from coins, that \"the trumpets were very high pitched with thin body and shrill sound.\" He adds that in \"War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness\", a manual for military organization and strategy discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls, these trumpets \"appear clearly capable of regulating their pitch pretty accurately, as they are supposed to blow rather complicated signals in unison.\" Whitcomb writes that the pair of silver trumpets were fashioned according to Mosaic law and were probably among the trophies which the Emperor Titus brought to Rome when he conquered Jerusalem. She adds that on the Arch raised to the victorious Titus, \"there is a sculptured relief of these trumpets, showing their ancient form. (see photo)\n\nThe flute was commonly used for festal and mourning occasions, according to Whitcomb. \"Even the poorest Hebrew was obliged to employ two flute-players to perform at his wife's funeral.\" The shofar (the horn of a ram) is still used for special liturgical purposes such as the Jewish New Year services in orthodox communities. As such, it is not considered a musical instrument but an instrument of theological symbolism which has been intentionally kept to its primitive character. In ancient times it was used for warning of danger, to announce the new moon or beginning of Sabbath, or to announce the death of a notable. \"In its strictly ritual usage it carried the cries of the multitude to God,\" writes Werner.\n\nAmong the percussion instruments were bells, cymbals, sistrum, tabret, hand drums, and tambourines. The tabret, or timbrel, was a small hand-drum used for festive occasions, and was considered a woman's instrument. In modern times it was often used by the Salvation Army. According to the Bible, when the children of Israel came out of Egypt and crossed the Red Sea, \"Miriam took a timbrel in her hands; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dance.\"\n\nIn Ancient Greece, instruments in all music can be divided into three categories, based on how sound is produced: string, wind, and percussion. The following were among the instruments used in the music of ancient Greece:\n\n\nIn the \"Aeneid\", Virgil makes numerous references to the trumpet. The lyre, kithara, aulos, hydraulis (water organ) and trumpet all found their way into the music of ancient Rome.\n\nThe Romans may have borrowed the Greek method of 'enchiriadic notation' to record their music, if they used any notation at all. Four letters (in English notation 'A', 'G', 'F' and 'C') indicated a series of four succeeding tones. Rhythm signs, written above the letters, indicated the duration of each note. Roman art depicts various woodwinds, \"brass\", percussion and stringed instruments. Roman-style instruments are found in parts of the Empire where they did not originate, and indicate that music was among the aspects of Roman culture that spread throughout the provinces.\n\nRoman instruments include:\n\nDuring the Medieval Music era (476 to 1400) the plainchant tunes used by monks for religious songs were primarily monophonic (a single melody line, with no harmony parts) and transmitted by oral tradition (\"by ear\"). The earliest Medieval music did not have any kind of notational system for writing down melodies. As Rome tried to centralize the various chants across vast distances of its empire, which stretched from Europe to North Africa, a form of music notation was needed to write down the melodies. So long as the church had to rely on teaching people chant melodies \"by ear\", it limited the number of people who could be taught. As well, when songs are learned by ear, variations and changes naturally slip in.\n\nVarious signs written above the chant texts, called \"neumes\" were introduced. These little signs indicated to the singer whether the melody went up in pitch or down in pitch. By the ninth century, it was firmly established as the primary method of musical notation. The next development in musical notation was \"heighted neumes\", in which neumes were carefully placed at different heights in relation to each other. This allowed the neumes to give a rough indication of the size of a given interval (e.g., a small interval like a tone or a large interval like a sixth) as well as the direction (up in pitch or down in pitch).\n\nAt first the little dots were just placed in the space about the words. However, this method made it hard to determine what pitch a song started on, or when a song was returning to the same pitch. This quickly led to one or two lines, each representing a particular note, being placed on the music with all of the neumes relating back to them, and being placed on or above the lines. The line or lines acted as a reference point to help the singer gauge which notes were higher or lower. At first, these lines had no particular meaning and instead had a letter placed at the beginning indicating which note was represented. However, the lines indicating middle C and the F a fifth below slowly became most common. The completion of the four-line staff is usually credited to Guido d' Arezzo (c. 1000–1050), one of the most important musical theorists of the Middle Ages. It should be noted that the neumatic notational system, even in its fully developed state, did not clearly define any kind of rhythm for the singing of notes. Singers were expected to be able to improvise the rhythm, using established traditions and norms.\nInstruments used to perform medieval music include the early flute, which was made of wood and which did not have any metal keys or pads. Flutes of this era could be made as a side-blown or end-blown instrument; the wooden recorder and the related instrument called the gemshorn; and the pan flute. Medieval music used many plucked string instruments like the lute, mandore, gittern and psaltery. The dulcimers, similar in structure to the psaltery and zither, were originally plucked, but became struck by hammers in the 14th century after the arrival of new technology that made metal strings possible.\n\nThe bowed lyra of the Byzantine Empire was the first recorded European bowed string instrument. The Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih of the 9th century (d. 911) cited the Byzantine lyra as a bowed instrument equivalent to the Arab rabāb and typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the \"urghun\" (organ), \"shilyani\" (probably a type of harp or lyre) and the \"salandj\" (probably a bagpipe). The hurdy-gurdy was a mechanical violin using a rosined wooden wheel attached to a crank to \"bow\" its strings. Instruments without sound boxes like the jaw harp were also popular in the time. Early versions of the organ, fiddle (or vielle), and trombone (called the sackbut) existed in the medieval era.\n\nThe Renaissance music era (c. 1400 to 1600) saw the development of many new technologies that affected the performance and distribution of songs and musical pieces. Around 1450, the printing press was invented, which made printed sheet music much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was laboriously hand-copied). The increased availability of printed sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger geographic area. One limiting factor to the wider dissemination of musical styles was that monks, nuns, aristocrats and professional musicians and singers were among the few people who could read music.\n\nMechanical plate engraving was developed in the late sixteenth century. Although plate engraving had been used since the early fifteenth century for creating visual art and maps, it was not applied to music until 1581. In this method, a mirror image of a complete page of music was engraved onto a metal plate. Ink was then applied to the grooves, and the music print was transferred onto paper. Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers. Copper was the initial metal of choice for early plates, but by the eighteenth century pewter became the standard material due to its malleability and lower cost.\n\nMany instruments originated during the Renaissance. Some instruments used during the Renaissance were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously in the medieval era. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals who were part of guilds, which kept playing techniques secret. Some of the more common brass instruments that were played included:\n\n\nStringed instruments included:\n\nPercussion instruments included:\n\nWoodwind instruments included:\n\n\nDuring the Baroque era of music (ca. 1600–1750), technologies for keyboard instruments developed, which led to improvements in the designs of pipe organs and harpsichords, and to the development of the first pianos. During the Baroque period, organ builders developed new types of pipes and reeds that created new tonal colors (timbres and sounds). Organ builders fashioned new stops that imitated various instruments, such as the viola da gamba stop. The Baroque period is often thought of as organ building's \"golden age,\" as virtually every important refinement to the instrument was brought to a peak. Builders such as Arp Schnitger, Jasper Johannsen, Zacharias Hildebrandt and Gottfried Silbermann constructed instruments that displayed both exquisite craftsmanship and beautiful sound. These organs featured well-balanced mechanical key actions, giving the organist precise control over the pipe speech. Schnitger's organs featured particularly distinctive reed timbres and large Pedal and Rückpositiv divisions.\n\nHarpsichord builders in the Southern Netherlands built instruments with two keyboard (two manuals) which could be used for transposition. These Flemish instruments served as the model for Baroque-era harpsichord construction in other nations. In France, the double keyboards were adapted to control different choirs (groups) of strings, making a more musically flexible instrument (e.g., the upper manual could be set to a quiet lute stop, while the lower manual could be set to a stop with multiple string choirs, for a louder sound; this enabled the harpsichorist to have two dynamics and tone colours from one instrument). Another approach that could be used on a two manual harpischord would be to use a coupler to make one manual play two choirs of strings (e.g., an 8' set of strings and a 16' set of strings an octave lower), so that this manual could be used for a loud solo sound, and then having another manual set to trigger only one manual, creating an accompaniment volume. Instruments from the peak of the French tradition, by makers such as the Blanchet family and Pascal Taskin, are among the most widely admired of all harpsichords, and are frequently used as models for the construction of modern instruments. In England, the Kirkman and Shudi firms produced sophisticated harpsichords of great power and sonority. German builders extended the sound repertoire of the instrument by adding sixteen foot choirs, adding to the lower register and two-foot choirs, which added to the upper register.\n\nThe piano was invented during the Baroque era by the expert harpsichord maker Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731) of Padua, Italy, who was employed by Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany. Cristofori invented the piano at some point before 1700. While the clavichord allowed expressive control of volume and sustain, it was too quiet for large performances. The harpsichord produced a sufficiently loud sound, but offered little expressive control over each note. The piano offered the best of both, combining loudness with dynamic control.\n\nCristofori's great success was solving, with no prior example, the fundamental mechanical problem of piano design: the hammer must strike the string, but not remain in contact with it (as a tangent remains in contact with a clavichord string) because this would damp the sound. Moreover, the hammer must return to its rest position without bouncing violently, and it must be possible to repeat the same note rapidly. Cristofori's piano action was a model for the many approaches to piano actions that followed. Cristofori's early instruments were much louder and had more sustain than the clavichord. The harpsichord continued to be used in performances during the first 50 years of the piano's existence; however, after 1750, the harpsichord was gradually phased out of orchestras and small music groups.\n\nFrom about 1790 onward, the Mozart-era piano underwent tremendous changes that led to the modern form of the instrument. This revolution was in response to a preference by composers and pianists for a more powerful, sustained piano sound, and made possible by the ongoing Industrial Revolution with resources such as high-quality steel piano wire for strings, and precision casting for the production of iron frames. Over time, the tonal range of the piano was also increased from the five octaves of Mozart's day to the 7-plus range found on modern pianos.\nEarly technological progress owed much to the firm of Broadwood. John Broadwood joined with another Scot, Robert Stodart, and a Dutchman, Americus Backers, to design a piano in the harpsichord case—the origin of the \"grand\". They achieved this in about 1777. They quickly gained a reputation for the splendour and powerful tone of their instruments, with Broadwood constructing ones that were progressively larger, louder, and more robustly constructed.\n\nThey sent pianos to both Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven, and were the first firm to build pianos with a range of more than five octaves: five octaves and a fifth (interval) during the 1790s, six octaves by 1810 (Beethoven used the extra notes in his later works), and seven octaves by 1820. The Viennese makers similarly followed these trends; however the two schools used different piano actions: Broadwoods were more robust, Viennese instruments were more sensitive.\n\nThe cornet, a piston-valved brass instrument related to the trumpet, could not have been developed without the improvement of piston valves by Heinrich Stölzel and Friedrich Blühmel. In the early 19th century these two instrument makers almost simultaneously invented the valves still used today. Beethoven's instrumentation for orchestra added piccolo, contrabassoon, and trombones to the triumphal finale of his Symphony No. 5 (1804–1808). A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver effects of \"storm\" and \"sunshine\" in the composer's dramatic Sixth Symphony. Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussion in his Ninth Symphony expanded the sound of the orchestra.\n\nDuring the Romantic music era (c. 1810 to 1900), one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music, which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or in chamber music groups, such as string quartets. Since mass-market sheet music was relatively inexpensive, this enabled composers and songwriters to distribute their songs and musical pieces to a larger audience and over a larger geographic area. While the widespread dissemination of sheet music helped to spread musical styles across a larger area, the impact was nevertheless restricted to the socioeconomic segments that could read music, sing melodies from sheet music and own pianos and other musical instruments–namely the middle class and the upper class. Individuals from lower socioeconomic segments were only indirectly able to benefit from this wider dissemination of musical styles (i.e., by hearing new songs performed by professional musicians in brothels or taverns), as poor people could typically not read music or own pianos or other expensive instruments.\n\nNew instruments such as the saxophone began to appear in some 19th-century orchestra scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example Maurice Ravel's orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky's \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" and Sergei Rachmaninoff's \"Symphonic Dances\", the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's \"Boléro\", Sergei Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2. The euphonium was used in a few late Romantic and works, usually playing parts marked \"tenor tuba\", including Richard Strauss's \"Ein Heldenleben\". The Wagner tuba, a modified member of the horn family, appears in Richard Wagner's cycle \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" and several other works by Strauss, Béla Bartók, and others; it has a prominent role in Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 7 in E Major. Cornets appear in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet \"Swan Lake\", Claude Debussy's \"La Mer\", and several orchestral works by Hector Berlioz.\n\nThe piano continued to undergo technological developments in the Romantic era, up until the 1860s. By the 1820s, the center of piano building innovation had shifted to Paris, where the Pleyel firm manufactured pianos used by Frédéric Chopin and the Érard firm manufactured those used by Franz Liszt. In 1821, Sébastien Érard invented the double escapement action, which incorporated a \"repetition lever\" (also called the \"balancier\") that permitted repeating a note even if the key had not yet risen to its maximum vertical position. This facilitated rapid playing of repeated notes, a musical device exploited by Liszt. When the invention became public, as revised by Henri Herz, the double escapement action gradually became standard in grand pianos, and is still incorporated into all grand pianos currently produced.\n\nOther improvements of the piano mechanism included the use of thick felt hammer coverings instead of layered leather or cotton. Felt, which was first introduced by Jean-Henri Pape in 1826, was a more consistent material, permitting wider dynamic ranges as hammer weights and string tension increased. The sostenuto pedal, invented in 1844 by Jean-Louis Boisselot and copied by the Steinway firm in 1874, allowed a wider range of effects.\n\nOne innovation that helped create the powerful, loud sound of the modern piano was the use of a strong iron frame. Also called the \"plate\", the iron frame sits atop the soundboard, and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string tension that can exceed 20 tons in a grand piano. The single-piece cast iron frame was patented in 1825 in Boston by Alpheus Babcock, combining the metal hitch pin plate (1821, claimed by Broadwood on behalf of Samuel Hervé) and resisting bars (Thom and Allen, 1820, but also claimed by Broadwood and Érard). The increased structural integrity of the iron frame allowed the use of thicker, tenser, and more numerous strings, which further increased the strength of the instrument's tone. In 1834, the Webster & Horsfal firm of Birmingham brought out a form of piano wire made from cast steel; according to Dolge it was \"so superior to the iron wire that the English firm soon had a monopoly.\"\n\nOther important advances included changes to the way the piano is strung, such as the use of a \"choir\" of three strings rather than two for all but the lowest notes, which made the piano louder and the implementation of an over-strung scale, in which the strings are placed in two separate planes, each with its own bridge height. The mechanical action structure of the upright piano was invented in London, England in 1826 by Robert Wornum, and upright models became the most popular model, also amplifying the sound. Upright pianos were more compact than grand pianos, and less expensive, so the invention of the upright piano helped make the piano an even more important instrument in private homes (for amateur music-making); in schools; in rehearsal halls; and in some types of performance venues.\n\n"}

Police concluded the site was \"the hub of a multi-million pound trafficking operation that spans beyond the UK\", and that some of the men may have been moved to Scandinavia and other parts of Europe to work. During 2011 police forces from four other counties in England raided Irish Traveller sites in connection with forced labour and human trafficking.\n\nAt 0530 UTC on 11 September 2011, approximately 100 police officers from BHMCU and other specialist units including the dog section, force helicopter and Authorised Firearms Officers, raided the caravan park to execute search warrants. As a result, four men and one woman were arrested and a further 24 men, all believed to be victims of slavery, were taken from the site.\n\nThe arrests were made under the provisions of Section 71 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, implemented in April 2010 to comply with Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which made it a criminal offence to hold someone \"in slavery or servitude, or requir[e] them to perform forced or compulsory labour.\" The youngest of the 24 was a 17-year-old boy, who, when released, returned to his family. Nine of the freed men later discharged themselves from hospital and refused to assist police. One of the nine accused the police of heavy-handed tactics, saying he had lived on the caravan site for several years working as a paver for £50 a day, claiming many of the other men were similarly paid.\n\nInitial news reports claimed that the police had been warned 28 previous times that captives were being held at the caravan park, or that 28 captives escaped, but officers explained that this was \"a misunderstanding\", and that the witness whose allegation had launched the operation in April had told them that 28 people were still being held as slaves. Most of the 24 were said to have been homeless or suffering from alcoholism. Police also found drugs, money and weapons during the raid.\n\nOf the fifteen freed men helping police, eight were of British nationality, three Polish, one Latvian and one Lithuanian, with two men of unconfirmed nationality, and ranged in age from 30 to 57 years. They were being housed temporarily at a British Red Cross rest centre set up to provide shelter for them while alternative accommodation was found and other necessary arrangements made. A Red Cross spokesperson said: \"Our emergency response volunteers are offering emotional support and giving the men any practical help they need, such as clothing and hygiene kits. We have also provided recreational activities such as games, a radio and DVDs.\"\n\nOn 12 September 2011, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced that Tommy Connors (30), Patrick Connors (19), James Connors (34) and James Connors (23) had been charged with \"conspiracy to hold a person in servitude and requiring them to perform forced labour\" and were remanded in custody to appear at Luton Magistrates' Court on 13 September 2011. A spokesman CPS Thames and Chiltern Complex Casework Unit explained: \"These charges relate to four victims who allege they have been held against their will and forced to live and work like slaves.\" A fifth person arrested, a woman, Josie Connors (aged 30), whom police revealed was pregnant, was originally released on police bail to be questioned further following the \"imminent\" birth of her child. However, on 15 September, she was charged with four offences related to activities at the Greenacres site. At a subsequent hearing, on 22 September, she was remanded on bail until 5 December 2011, on condition that she remained at home and only left to give birth at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury.\n\nSpeaking on 12 September Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Sean O'Neil of BHMCU said: \"I am confident that while the investigation is in its early stages this is a family-run 'business' and is an organised crime group that has been broken up by the Netwing operation.\" DCI O'Neil explained: \"Some of these people have come out covered in excrement and dirty clothing because that was all they were allowed to live in. After being cared for, given food and fresh clothing, we hope to then interview them. That in itself will take a long time because these people are institutionalized. One person we know has been here fifteen years, so to him this is normal life.\"\n\nOn 21 September 2011, three further arrests took place at the caravan park. One of those arrested, Johnny Connors (30), was charged later that day with four offences including conspiracy to hold someone in servitude, and conspiracy to require someone to perform forced labour. The other two arrested were a woman (61) remanded in custody, and a man (51) who was released on police bail pending medical treatment. Tommy Conners (senior; aged 51) was subsequently charged on 3 October 2011 with 11 offences of conspiracy to place people in servitude or forced labour.\n\nOn 5 December 2011, 7 people arrested in this case appeared at Luton Crown Court on 16 counts of conspiracy to hold a person in servitude and requiring a person to perform forced labour. They are:\n\nOnly Josie was released on bail and the rest were kept in custody. On 11 July 2012, Tommy Connors senior, James John Connors, Patrick Connors, and Josie Connors were convicted of controlling, exploiting, verbally abusing and beating the men for financial gain at the caravan site near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. The trial lasted 13 weeks.\n\nAndrew Selous, MP for South West Bedfordshire, told the House of Commons: \"Following this weekend's utterly despicable revelations of the way in which twenty-four of my constituents have been kept as slaves, some for fifteen years, I'd like to commend the robust action of Bedfordshire Police in bringing this to light\", and asked the Government to \"pay particular attention to the issue of internal trafficking within the UK, given that seventeen of these twenty-four slaves were British citizens.\" Damian Green MP, Minister of State for Immigration said the incident \"came as a shock to many of us. What we saw was effective police action, co-ordinated in many ways by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The new National Crime Agency will have among its functions co-ordinating activity against trafficking, both domestic and international, which will give us a much more effective way of combating this particularly vile crime.\"\n\nKlara Skrivankova, Trafficking Programme Coordinator at Anti-Slavery International, said: \"Slavery and this case which appears to be a case of forced labour is a reality in Britain today but I think what it shows to us is that the police have finally been given proper powers in the new law that has been mentioned in order to investigate and really go after those who are still behaving like slave-masters in the 21st century.\"\n\nIn an article on 16 April 2008, Dr Donald Kenrick, an expert on the Romany language, is quoted as saying \"Dossers are people gipsies pick up to work for them. They are sometimes called slaves or servants. ... It is common among Irish travellers, but the English do it as well.\" However he disputed that they were really slaves, saying that the practice meant that otherwise vulnerable people were being cared for. He said the travellers favoured single men, who were strong workers, but of poor mental health.\n\nThe 2011 series of police investigations on Travellers' sites began after the decomposed body of Christopher Nicholls, missing since 2005, was found in March 2008 near the Beggars Roost caravan site in Staverton, Gloucestershire. Covert surveillance of several Traveller sites began in March 2010 and police observed 22 alleged slaves at the Beggar's Roost site. \n\nOn 22 March 2011 police raided Beggar's Roost and arrested William Connors (50) and his wife Breda (46).\n\nAround 27 March 2011 simultaneous raids were carried out at Traveller sites in Enderby, Leicestershire, where eight alleged slaves were found, and Pleasley, Derbyshire, where seven alleged slaves were found. William Connors' son John Connors was arrested at the Pleasley site, and his son-in-law Miles Connors at the Enderby site. All four were charged with \"conspiring together and with others to hold people in slavery or servitude between April [2010] and March [2011].\" It was alleged that the victims were \"vulnerable homeless individuals\" who were offered accommodation and work and then moved into \"virtually uninhabitable\" caravans. Prosecuting solicitor Graham Dono told Cheltenham Magistrates' Court: \"They then required them to do manual work for excessive hours for payments of no more than £20 a day and in some cases no payment at all. They were given minimal amounts of food. Movements are restricted, mobile phones are not allowed and victims are kept in fear of reprisals if they attempt to leave ... Men would be forced to work for up to 14 hours a day and moved from location to location around the country. It is clear from police videos that the slaves have minimal clothing, they are always dirty and disheveled, they look extremely unhappy and there is evidence of members of the Connors family at the locations in charge of the workers. Victims who had tried to leave sites had been tracked down and returned by members of the Connors family. These victims are extremely vulnerable and are now in a safe house. We say some of them have been indoctrinated for as much as 20 years working in this way. They are people who are clearly fearful. Twenty victims have so far been recovered from the Connors family but inquiries are at an early stage and it is expected there will be more.\"\n\nOn 24 June 2011, John Conners (26), Jerry Conners (19), and Eileen Conners (59) were arrested and charged with offences under section 71 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 after 120 police officers raided a Travellers' site at Hamble, Hampshire to execute a series of warrants as part of Operation Helm.\n\nOn Friday 16 September 2011 50 police raided a travellers' camp at Pulmer Water near Codicote, Hertfordshire, and there found and removed four Chinese nationals (3 men and a woman) and two British men who were suspected of being held as slaves. It is suspected that the four Chinese were illegally trafficked into Britain.\n\nIn a court case in May 1999 one John Williams described how the previous year he was taken from London to Basildon, forced to work all day and then locked in a stable at Crays Hill. He was threatened and told he would have to stay for 6 months but managed to escape the next day.\n\nIn Hargnies, near Mauberge in northeast France on 14 December 2005, eight travellers were arrested for keeping six slaves and using them for forced harvest work.\n\n"}
{"id": "8190143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8190143", "title": "Phantom practice", "text": "Phantom practice\n\nPhantom practice is the purported phenomenon in which a person's abilities continue to improve, even without practicing at all. It is mostly associated with practicing a musical instrument. After habitual practicing, a person may believe that they have continued to experience improvement even after they stop practicing. Whether these individuals have actually improved or whether it is simply a subjective perception on their part has not been ascertained by researchers.\n\nThe phenomenon of retaining a physical skill that has not been used in a long time is well understood. The physical skills of holding and playing an instrument are held in a reflex-level long-term memory called \"kinesthetic memory\", \"motor memory\", or \"muscle memory.\" Kinesthetic memory is very durable, and as such, a person may retain the ability to perform on an instrument that they previously played regularly, even if they have not practiced the instrument for weeks or months.\n\nA sense of confidence is an important performing skill. In a musical sense, confidence can translate into a stronger tone, more self-assured entrances, and a better stage presence. A nervous, anxious player or singer, on the other hand, is likely to have a wavering tone, uncertain intonation, and hesitant entrances. Since confidence often develops as a person matures and gains life experience, some people may notice an improvement in playing a former childhood instrument that they take up again as an adult. Again, although such a person may attribute their stronger tone and playing style to \"phantom practicing\", other factors such as increased confidence may have caused the improvements.\n\nDuring the interval of not practicing, a person purporting to have experienced \"phantom practicing\" may have developed other factors besides instrument practicing which contribute to the quality of musical performance, such as rhythmic skill. For example, a drummer who abandons music in their teens, and then studies dancing in their 30s may find, if they return to drumming in their 40s, that their sense of rhythm has improved. While this person might attribute their improved drumming skills to \"phantom practice\", a more likely explanation is that they improved their rhythmic skills and \"time feel\" confidence in the intervening decades.\n\nAnother possibility is that a person may improve their knowledge of musical styles and idioms during a period of non-practicing. For example, if a person learns all of the core jazz piano techniques in their teens, and then abandons the instrument, followed by a 20-year interval of listening to jazz and going to jazz concerts, this person may feel that they have benefitted from \"phantom practicing\" if they return to jazz piano playing in their 40s. Instead, it is more likely that the improvement in this person's jazz playing is due to decades of experience of listening to authentic jazz playing \"comping\" and \"blowing\".\n"}

The article reported the establishment of a \"Southern Growth Policies Board\" in Durham, North Carolina, \"by some 70 politicians and professors who believe their region of 60 million citizens has entered an era in which race relations are soon to be replaced as a major concern by population increase, industrial development, and economic fluctuations\".\n\nSome Americans saw the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama, and his election in 2008 as the first black president of the United States, as a sign that the nation had, in fact, become post-racial. The conservative radio host Lou Dobbs, for example, said in November 2009, \"We are now in a 21st-century post-partisan, post-racial society.\" Two months later, Chris Matthews, an MSNBC host, said of President Obama, \"He is post-racial by all appearances. You know, I forgot he was black tonight for an hour.\"\n\nHowever, public opinion on whether the United States is post-racial is itself divided starkly by race. In a Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted in December 2014, about 50% of white respondents said they believed that the justice system treats Americans of all races equally, but only 10% of African-Americans said the same. In the spring of 2015, according to a Gallup poll, 13 percent of black Americans surveyed identified race relations as the most important problem the United States faces, compared with 4 percent of white Americans.\n\nArguments that the United States is \"not\" post-racial frequently emphasize the treatment of African-Americans and other racial minorities in the criminal justice system and in interactions with the police. Killings of unarmed African-Americans, often by police officers, have been widely publicized. In 2015, according to a study by \"The Guardian\", police officers in the United States killed 7.13 black Americans per million, compared with 2.91 white Americans per million. Additionally:\n\nSuch killings had a marked effect on public perceptions of race relations in America. The 13 percent of black Americans who called race relations the most pressing problem in the United States in the spring 2015 Gallup poll dwarfed the 3 percent that Gallup reported at the beginning of 2014. And the percentage of white Americans who said race relations were the most important issue rose to 4 percent in 2015 from 1 percent in 2014.\n\nIn response to high-profile incidents such as the fatal shootings of Michael Brown, Aiyana Jones, Trayvon Martin, Laquan McDonald, Tamir Rice, and Walter Scott, and the death of Freddie Gray from a spinal-cord injury sustained in police custody, academics and journalists have denounced claims that America is post-racial. Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote in \"The Atlantic\" in 2015 that the phrase \"post-racial\" was \"usually employed by talk-show hosts and news anchors looking to measure progress in the Obama era.\" And Anna Holmes wrote in \"The New York Times\", \"Chattel slavery and the legacies it left behind continue to shape American society. Sometimes it seems as if the desire for a 'post-racial' America is an attempt by white people to liberate themselves from the burden of having to deal with that legacy.\" However, others argue that post-racial politics champions aggressive action to deliver economic opportunity and weed out police misconduct, without the divisive framing of racial identity. \nUnder this view, there is no claim that America has attained a fully post-racial society, however it is argued that news selection is skewed toward amplifying racial conflict, events demonstrating racial harmony are dismissed as non-newsworthy, and that such media conflict-bias acts to undermine trust and impede progress. Rather, any true measure of race relations must gauge the everyday daily experiences of Americans in interacting with people of differing backgrounds. An assumption is that the media will cherry-pick the most outrageous, racially-inflammatory events to cover no matter how infrequently they are occurring, and thus misreport progress toward a post-racial ideal. The central tenet of post-racial problem-solving practice is to seek the \"alternative explanation\" when conflict arises (presuming non-racist motives in others), in order to find common ground and creatively resolve the conflict. Examples of post-racial framing in attacking misconduct by the Criminal Justice System are video recording of all police-citizen interactions, creating a Citizens Review Board with investigative powers, and assigning an independent prosecutor. Or, in the educational sphere, creating charters, academies and school choice to turn around under-performing schools. The divide in public opinion on the status of race in America was reflected in reactions to the Black Lives Matter movement. In response to the \"black lives matter\" rallying cry, some people, including politicians, began using the phrase \"all lives matter\". After a sheriff's deputy in Harris County, Texas, was fatally shot while pumping gas in August, Sheriff Ron Hickman claimed that the rhetoric of Black Lives Matter activists had contributed to the killing and said, \"We've heard 'black lives matter'. All lives matter. Well, cops' lives matter, too. So why don't we just drop the qualifier and just say 'lives matter', and take that to the bank.' Supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement criticized the \"all lives matter\" phrase, arguing that it minimized the systemic threats faced by African-Americans. President Obama said in October, \"There is a specific problem that is happening in the African-American community that's not happening in other communities.\" Andrew Rosenthal wrote, similarly, in \"The New York Times\", \"The point of 'Black Lives Matter' is that the lives of African-Americans have come under special and deadly threat since before the birth of this country.\"\n\nEvidence of continued racial divisions in the United States can also be found in demographics. For instance, African-Americans account for less than 15 percent of the total population of Michigan, but more than 82 percent of the population of the state's largest city, Detroit — and Detroit, like many cities whose residents are predominantly black, has \"resegregated schools, dwindling tax bases and decaying public services\".\n\nThere is a similar dynamic in Louisiana; the state was about 64 percent white as of the 2010 Census, but its largest city, New Orleans, is 60 percent black. Further segregation can be found within New Orleans: the Lower Ninth Ward, for example, is 97 percent black. This was the neighborhood that experienced the most catastrophic flooding after Hurricane Katrina, and the government's response to the disaster has been cited as evidence of the continued presence of racism in the United States. Most of the victims were black and poor, and class was a major factor in who survived: Those who lived in areas better protected from flooding, and those who were able to evacuate before the storm, tended to be wealthier. At the time, President George W. Bush acknowledged that this poverty had \"roots in the history of racial discrimination, which cut off generations from the opportunities of America\".\n\nThe idea that America is post-racial, or close to it, has played a role in at least one United States Supreme Court decision. In \"Shelby County v. Holder\" in 2013, the court invalidated a section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that had required nine states with particularly severe histories of racial discrimination to obtain federal approval for any change to their election laws. The ruling, written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., said in part, \"Our country has changed.\" It added that in the decades since the Voting Rights Act was passed, \"voting tests were abolished, disparities in voter registration and turnout due to race were erased, and African-Americans attained political office in record numbers. And yet the coverage formula that Congress reauthorized in 2006 ignores these developments, keeping the focus on decades-old data relevant to decades-old problems, rather than current data reflecting current needs.\" Similar issues are involved in \"Fisher v. University of Texas\", a challenge to affirmative action policies on which the court is expected to rule in 2016.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25256474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25256474", "title": "Public menorah", "text": "Public menorah\n\nA public menorah is a large menorah displayed publicly during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. It is done to celebrate the holiday and publicize the miracle of Hanukkah, and is typically accompanied by a public event during one of the nights of Hanukkah attended by invited dignitaries who are honored with lighting the menorah.\n\nPublic menorah lighting were initiated by Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson in 1974. The most prominent public menorah celebration takes place in Washington DC, and is known as the National Menorah. In 2013 Chabad planned 15,000 public menorah lighting events across the globe.\n\nThe concept of lighting a menorah in a way that allows the public to see it dates back to ancient times, where menorahs were lit outside of people's homes in order to publicize the miracle of Hanukkah. The concept of lighting a large menorah in public was initiated by Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, known as the Lubavitcher Rebbe.\n\nIn 1973 Rabbi Schneerson announced his Hanukkah-awareness campaign, encouraging his followers and emissaries to reach out to their fellow Jews and give them the opportunity to kindle the Hanukkah lights. That year they distributed some 60,000 tin menorahs. In 1974, in continuation of Rabbi Schneerson's Hanukkah awareness campaign, when Rabbi Abraham Shemtov kindled a menorah at the foot of the Liberty Bell at Independence Hall. The following year, in 1975, rock promoter Bill Graham sponsored Chabad's menorah in San Francisco.\n\nSince 1974, the concept of public menorahs has expanded. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter participated in the lighting of the public menorah erected by Chabad. In 2013, Chabad planned 15,000 public menorah lighting events across the globe. And in 2014, the public menorah in Washington, D.C. was kindled by Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nScholars have cited this initiative by Rabbi Schneerson as a prime factor in Hanukkah becoming such a widely celebrated festival.\n\nSince 1979, the National Menorah has been lit on the White House grounds in celebration of Hanukkah. President Jimmy Carter attended that first ceremony, and President Ronald Reagan designated it the National Menorah. In 2009 the ceremony included then-White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel (now mayor of Chicago), followed by Chief of Staff Jack Lew in 2010 and 2011. In 2012, the first candle was lit with the help of Jeffrey Zients, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\nThe world's largest menorah stands at 32 feet and is lit at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street in Manhattan near Central Park. A 4,000-pound structure, it is the work of Israeli artist Yaacov Agam. Because of the menorah's height, Con Edison assists the lighting by using a crane to lift each person to the top. A Guinness World Record is pending.\n\nEach year, the House of Commons of the United Kingdom holds a menorah lighting at the home of the Speaker of the House of Commons. The menorah currently used was commissioned by the Rt. Hon. Michael J. Martin MP, former Speaker of the House of Commons.\n\nSince 2007, Chabad has organized a public menorah celebration at Trafalgar Square. Each year the event is sponsored by Chabad, the Jewish Leadership Council, the London Jewish Forum and the mayor of London.\n\nPublic menorahs are prominently displayed throughout Israel, notably in the Ben Gurion airport\n\nEach year Nicosia has lit a National Menorah in celebration of Hanukkah. Nicosia as the capital of the Republic of Cyprus has been the pioneer city to put a Menorah in its city center.\n\nA large menorah is located at Toronto City Hall at the south east corner of Nathan Phillips Square during Hanukkah. as well as smaller one is also found at Old City Hall.\n\nThe success of the public menorah campaign has not been without controversy. In 1988, the American Jewish Congress produced a 28-page report entitled \"The Year of the Menorah\", criticizing Chabad's public menorah campaign and the litigation that went with it. It complained of the increase in the number of menorahs placed on public lands, arguing that it was causing tension both within the community and with non-Jews. In 1989, the ACLU challenged the legality of a display of a Chabad-owned public menorah in County of Allegheny. In a court case County of Allegheny v. ACLU the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the menorah. \n\nIn 1989, the city of Burlington, Vermont denied the local Chabad chapter, headed by Rabbi Yitzchok Raskin permission to erect a menorah in the city's main park during Hanukkah. Raskin appealed the decision on two occasions after an initial hearing 1987 found the display to be unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU assisted the City of Burlington in a final appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1991, and the menorah ban was upheld. There have been similar cases involving Chabad public menorahs with the courts ruling against Chabad, including Chicago (1990) Iowa (1986), Cincinnati (1991), and Georgia (1991). In addition, in 1991, in White Plains, New York, the Common Council unanimously rejected the display of a Chabad menorah in a public space in the town with the support of many Jews, affirming a local tradition of keeping parks free of religious and political displays.\n\nOn the other hand, in 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Rabbi Sholom B. Kalmanson of Chabad of Southern Ohio to light an 18-foot menorah in Cincinnati's Fountain Square. Justice John Paul Stevens upheld a lower court ruling that the city could not ban the menorah and other religious displays from the square.\n\nDue to the menorah being a Jewish symbol, menorahs in public have been subject to anti-Semitic violence. For instance, in 2009 in Moldova, a group of fundamentalist Orthodox Christians took down a public menorah and replaced it with a cross. The same year, in Vienna, Austria, a Chabad rabbi was attacked by a Muslim man while leading the candle lighting ceremony.\n\nControversy has also arisen at the Western Wall in Israel. For Hanukkah every year a giant menorah is erected in the men's section of the Western Wall and each night of the eight nights of the festival, male rabbis and male politicians are honored, while women are kept at a distance, where they are barely able to see the ceremony. Women of the Wall sent a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu requesting a large menorah also be erected in the women's section, but Netanyahu simply forwarded the letter to Western Wall rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, who accused WoW of ulterior motives of trying to change the customs at the Wall. Responding to Rabinowitz' accusation, Anat Hoffman noted: \"In his letter, Rabbi Rabinowitz speaks of bringing together and uniting the nation, and yet his actions exclude and discriminate against women as if women are not part of the same nation. Since he was chosen for this public position, Rabinowitz has never invited Women of the Wall or any other women to participate in the ceremonies or to be honored with the lighting of a candle at the Kotel on Hanukkah, despite the fact that women are obligated equally to men in this religious act.\" In December 2014 the personal menorahs the women brought to the Kotel were confiscated, but they were returned when police were called.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1158934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1158934", "title": "Rabindra Sangeet", "text": "Rabindra Sangeet\n\nRabindra Sangeet ( \"Robindro shonggit\", ), also known as Tagore Songs, are songs from the Indian subcontinent written and composed by the Bengali polymath Rabindranath Tagore, winner of the 1913 Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore was a prolific composer with around 2,230 songs to his credit. The songs have distinctive characteristics in the music of Bengal, popular in India and Bangladesh. It is characterised by its distinctive rendition while singing which includes a significant amount of ornamentation like meend, murki, etc. and is filled with expressions of romanticism. The music is mostly based on Hindustani classical music, Carnatic Classical Music, Western tunes and the inherent Folk music of Bengal and inherently possess within them, a near perfect balance, an endearing economy of poetry and musicality.\n\nRabindra Sangeet merges fluidly into Tagore's literature, most of which—poems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alike—were lyricised. Influenced by the \"thumri\" style of Hindustani music, they ran the entire gamut of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like Brahmo devotional hymns to quasi-erotic compositions. They emulated the tonal color of classical \"ragas\" to varying extents. Some songs mimicked a given raga's melody and rhythm faithfully; others newly blended elements of different \"ragas\". Yet about nine-tenths of his work was not \"bhanga gaan\", the body of tunes revamped with \"fresh value\" from select Western, Hindustani, Bengali folk and other regional flavours \"external\" to Tagore's own ancestral culture. Scholars have attempted to gauge the emotive force and range of Hindustani \"ragas\":\n\nTagore influenced sitar maestro Vilayat Khan and \"sarodiyas\" Buddhadev Dasgupta and Amjad Ali Khan. His songs are widely popular and undergird the Bengali ethos to an extent perhaps rivalling Shakespeare's impact on the English-speaking world. It is said that his songs are the outcome of five centuries of Bengali literary churning and communal yearning. Dhan Gopal Mukerji has said that these songs transcend the mundane to the aesthetic and express all ranges and categories of human emotion. The poet gave voice to all—big or small, rich or poor. The poor Ganges boatman and the rich landlord air their emotions in them. They birthed a distinctive school of music whose practitioners can be fiercely traditional: novel interpretations have drawn severe censure in both West Bengal and Bangladesh.\n\nFor Bengalis, the songs' appeal, stemming from the combination of emotive strength and beauty described as surpassing even Tagore's poetry, was such that the \"Modern Review\" observed that \"[t]here is in Bengal no cultured home where Rabindranath's songs are not sung or at least attempted to be sung ... Even illiterate villagers sing his songs\". A. H. Fox Strangways of \"The Observer\" introduced non-Bengalis to \"rabindrasangit\" in \"The Music of Hindostan\", calling it a \"vehicle of a personality ... [that] go behind this or that system of music to that beauty of sound which all systems put out their hands to seize.\"\n\nIn 1971, \"Amar Shonar Bangla\" became the national anthem of Bangladesh. It was written—ironically—to protest the 1905 Partition of Bengal along communal lines: lopping Muslim-majority East Bengal from Hindu-dominated West Bengal was to avert a regional bloodbath. Tagore saw the partition as a ploy to upend the independence movement, and he aimed to rekindle Bengali unity and tar communalism. \"Jana Gana Mana\" was written in \"shadhu-bhasha\", a Sanskritised register of Bengali, and is the first of five stanzas of a Brahmo hymn that Tagore composed. It was first sung in 1911 at a Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress and was adopted in 1950 by the Constituent Assembly of the Republic of India as its national anthem.\n\nHis songs are affectionately called Rabindra Sangeet, and cover topics from humanism, structuralism, introspection, psychology, romance, yearning, nostalgia, reflection, modernism. Tagore primarily worked with two subjects – first, the human being, the being and the becoming of that human being, and second, Nature, in all her myriad forms and colours, and of the relationship between the human being and Nature and how Nature affects the behavior and the expressions of human beings. \"Bhanusimha Thakurer Padavali \" (or \"Bhanusingher Podaboli\"), one of Tagore's earliest works in music, was primarily in a language that is similar and yet different from Bengali – this language, Brajabuli, was derived from the language of the Vaishnav hymns, and of texts like Jayadeva's \"Gita Govinda\", some influences from Sanskrit can be found, courtesy Tagore's extensive homeschooling in the Puranas, the Upanishads, as well as in poetic texts like Kalidasa's \"Meghadūta\" and \"Abhigyanam Shakuntalam\". Tagore was one of the greatest narrators of all time, and throughout his life, we find a current of narration through all his works that surges with upheavals in the psyche of the people around him, as well as with the changes of seasons. A master of metaphor, it is often difficult to identify the true meaning that underlies his texts, but what is truly great about Tagore, is that his songs are identifiable with any and every possible mood, with every possible situation that is encountered by a person in the course of life. This truly reinforces the notion that Rabindrasangeet has at its heart some unbelievably powerful poetry. The Upanishads influenced his writing throughout his life, and his devotional music is addressed almost always to an inanimate entity, a personal, a private god, whom modernists call the Other.\n\nRabindranath Tagore was a curator of melodic and compositional styles. In the course of his travels all over the world, he came into contact with the musical narratives of the West, of the South of India, and these styles are reflected in some of his songs. There are several classifications of his work. The ones that beginners most often use is that based on genre – devotional (Puja Porjaay), romantic (Prem Porjaay) [Note: It often becomes difficult, if not impossible, on hearing a song, to determine if it falls in the devotional genre or the romantic. The line between the two is blurred, by certain creations of Tagore himself, e.g. Tomarei Koriyachi Jibonero Dhrubotara. Also, Tagore never made these divisions. Only after his death was the need felt to categorize, compile and thus preserve his work, and the genre-classification system was born out of this need.] seasonal (Prokriti Porjaay) – summer (Grishho), monsoon (Borsha), autumn (Shorot), early winter (Hemonto), winter (Sheet), Spring (Boshonto); diverse (Bichitro), patriotic (Deshatmobodhok). Although Deshatmobodh and patriotism are completely antipodal concepts, yet the difficulties of translation present themselves, apart from songs specified for certain events or occasions (Aanushtthanik) and the songs he composed for his numerous plays and dance-dramas.\n\nThe book forming a collection of all 2,233 songs written by Rabindranath is called \"Gitabitan\" (\"Garden of songs\") and forms an important part of extant historical materials pertaining to Bengali musical expression. The six major parts of this book are \"Puja\" (worship), \"Prem\" (love), \"Prakriti\" (seasons), \"Swadesh\" (patriotism), \"Aanushthanik\" (occasion-specific), \"Bichitro\" (miscellaneous) and \"Nrityonatya\" (dance dramas and lyrical plays).\n\nThe \"Swarabitan\", published in 64 volumes, includes the texts of 1,721 songs and their musical notation. The volumes were first published between 1936 and 1955.\n\nEarlier collections, all arranged chronologically, include \"Rabi Chhaya\" (1885), \"Ganer Bahi o Valmiki Pratibha\" (1893), \"Gan\" (1908), and \"Dharmashongit\" (1909).\n\nRabindra Sangeet has been an integral part of Bengal culture for over a century. Hindu monk and Indian social reformer Swami Vivekananda became an admirer of Rabindra Sangeet in his youth. He composed music in the Rabindra Sangeet style, for example \"Gaganer Thale\" in Raga Jaijaivanti.\n\nMany of Tagore's songs form the worship hymnal and hymns in many Churches in Kolkata and West Bengal. Some examples are Aaguner Poroshmoni and Aanondoloke Mongolaloke.\n\nAs of July 2016, 7,864 Rabindra Sangeet have been digitized by Saregama and is available online for download.\n\nSome well-known singers of Rabindrasangeet are:\n\n\n\n\nFor year of composition, raga and tala of Tagore's songs, see:\n\n"}
{"id": "37328605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37328605", "title": "Relative age effect", "text": "Relative age effect\n\nThe term relative age effect (RAE), also known as birthdate effect or birth date effect, is used to describe a bias, evident in the upper echelons of youth sport and academia, where participation is higher amongst those born early in the relevant selection period (and correspondingly lower amongst those born late in the selection period) than would be expected from the normalised distribution of live births. The selection period is usually the calendar year, the academic year or the sporting season. The difference in maturity - which can be extreme at young ages: a six-year old born in January is almost 17% older than a six-year old born in December in the same year - causes a performance gap that persists over time.\n\nThe term month of birth bias is also used to describe the effect and season of birth bias is used to describe similar effects driven by different hypothesised mechanisms.\n\nThe bias results from the common use of age related systems, for organizing youth sports competition and academic cohorts, based on specific cut-off dates to establish eligibility for inclusion. Typically a child born after the cut-off date is included in a cohort and a child born before the cut-off date is excluded from it.\n\nThe most commonly used cut-off date for youth international sporting competition is 1 January. The IOC and FIFA and the 6 international football confederations (AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC and UEFA) all use 1 January as their administrative cut-off date when determining an athlete's eligibility to compete in youth competitions, children born before a specified cut-off date are excluded.\n\nMalcolm Gladwell's book Outliers: The Story of Success and SuperFreakonomics by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner have popularised the issue in respect of Canadian ice-hockey players, European football players and US Major League baseball players.\n\nThe expected distribution of births in any given month across a population correlates closely to the number of days in the month, with February as the shortest month having the fewest births. The first graph shows the distribution of births, by month, for the European Union over the ten years from 2000 to 2009. There is a slight but clearly perceptible increase in the birth rate in the summer months.\n\nA relative age effect is illustrated in the second graph by the month of birth distribution of over 4,000 youth players involved in the qualifying squads for U17, U19 and U21 tournaments organised by UEFA in 2010/11.\n\nResearch suggests that individuals born closer to the cut-off date are more likely to play professionally.\n\nCut-off dates for academic cohort structuring, including the setting of academic years, are usually determined by national education authorities and tend to be based on autumn start dates, so August or September cut-off dates are common in the Northern Hemisphere and February or March cut-off dates are common in the Southern Hemisphere. This tendency reflects the historical need for children to be involved in summer-time agricultural work with school starting after harvesting.A relative age effect in academia is illustrated in the third graph which shows the percent deviation from month of birth profile norms evident in graduations from Oxford University over a 10-year period. Academic relative age effects seem to be moderated by culture.\n\nA 2006 study finds that relative age affects student performance and has long-lasting effects on life outcomes. The authors find that \"the youngest members of each cohort score 4–12 percentiles lower than the oldest members in grade four and 2–9 percentiles lower in grade eight… data from Canada and the United States show that the youngest members of each cohort are even less likely to attend university.\"\n\nA 2014 study finds that Italian students born in the early months of the year \"are more likely to be tracked in more academic schools rather than in vocational schools.\"\n\nA relative age effect has also been observed in the context of leadership. Studies have found an over-representation of people born just after the school entry cut-off date in a range of leadership positions. Such an over-representation starts in high-school leadership activities such as sports team captain or club president. In the adult life, this over-representation has been observed in top managerial positions (CEOs of S&P 500 companies), and in top political positions, both in the USA (senators and representatives), and in Finland (MPs).\n\nWhilst an over-representation of early-born participation is evident in the aspirational fields of elite sport and education there is also evidence of a corresponding disproportionate over-representation of late-born children in epidemiologically defined cohorts exhibiting conditions such as ADHD, schizophrenia and obesity.

The ninth main game in the \"Resident Evil\" series, it was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in October 2012 and for Windows in March 2013. Players control Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller, and Ada Wong, who confront the force behind a worldwide bio-terrorist attack; each character has unique abilities and styles.\n\n\"Resident Evil 6\" was conceptualized in 2009 and entered full development the following year under \"Resident Evil 4\" producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi. It had a development staff of more than 600, making it Capcom's largest production.\n\n\"Resident Evil 6\" received mixed reviews; some reviewers praised the game's storyline and themes, but the interwoven campaigns and departure from survival horror received criticism. With over 10 million copies sold, it is the third-bestselling Capcom game. It was rereleased for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with all downloadable content.\n\n\"Resident Evil 6\" allows players to select between four scenarios with interwoven storylines. Each scenario follows one of four main protagonists: Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller and Ada Wong. The player-characters from each scenario will have their own partners whom are controlled by either artificial intelligence (AI) or another player via local or online multiplayer. In addition, each scenario features a different play-style; for example, some player-characters are more vulnerable to attacks whereas others are more resilient. Each central character has unique abilities, which vary from increased reload times and carrying more ammunition. \"Resident Evil 6\" presents new innovations and gameplay mechanics such as rolling in any direction and running while shooting and sliding. The game also features a four-player co-operative mode. When playing in single player mode, the player can allow another player to join in online at any time. While performing certain actions, quick time events may occur, in which the player must follow onscreen prompts by pressing buttons or manipulating joysticks within a limited amount of time.\n\nA new feature comes in the form of tablets; players may consume them in order to recover health, and more can be produced by mixing herbs. If one player runs out of health, that player will have a short time to try to defend themselves while their partners attempt to revive them. If any non-AI players are killed, gameplay will resume at the last checkpoint. The game features several primary enemies, including zombies and the newly introduced J'avo. Unlike zombies, J'avo are able to interact with each other to plan an attack, use weapons, and heal themselves. Also some J'avo are susceptible to various mutations that increase their prowess in battle, the type of mutation sometimes depends on location of the injury. There are a total of 15 different mutations within the game. Certain enemies drop skill points when killed, which can be picked up and spent on upgrades such as increased weapon effectiveness or specific ammunition drops. The campaigns feature a \"Lone Wolf\" ability which allows the player to remove their artificial intelligence companion character. Players can equip three of these upgrades which apply to all campaigns. The game also features a stamina bar; which depletes once the player performs melee attacks, or uses a \"quickshot\" — which involves shooting a zombie with a headshot instantly. \"Resident Evil 6\" is twice as long as \"Resident Evil 5\".\n\nThe game features two new modes. \"Mercenaries\" mode involves players fighting for survival against hordes of enemies. In the PC version, the Mercenaries mode features an exclusive sub-mode named \"No Mercy\", which involves the cast from \"Left 4 Dead 2\" fighting a total number of 300 enemies against a timer. \"Agent Hunt\" mode allows players to take control of random enemies in other people's online sessions, however it is only unlocked after the player clears the three main campaigns. The longer the player stays in another online session, the more points they will earn.\n\nOn 24 December 2012, Jake Muller, son of late bio-terrorist Albert Wesker, flees local authorities during a bio-terrorist attack. He partners with Division of Security Operations (DSO) agent and Raccoon City survivor Sherry Birkin and learns that she is to extract him from the country to create a vaccine for the new C-Virus. However, they are hunted by Ustanak, a hulking bio-weapon. Meanwhile, a Bio-terrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) strike team led by Chris Redfield and Piers Nivans is deployed to combat the infected local populace. However, they are attacked by the leader of Neo-Umbrella, who refers to herself as Ada Wong; she kills most of the BSAA members, using a device that injects them with the C-virus, turning them into monsters, except Chris and Piers. Chris goes into a self-imposed exile, afflicted with post-traumatic amnesia. Meanwhile, Sherry and Jake's extraction from Edonia by the BSAA is sabotaged, forcing them to crash into the mountains. They are captured by \"Ada\" for six months.\n\nOn 29 June 2013, US President Adam Benford attempts to publicly reveal the truth behind the 1998 Raccoon City incident and the government's dealings with Umbrella, to end further bio-terrorist activity. However, the venue is hit by another attack, infecting the President; the sole survivors, DSO agent and Raccoon City survivor Leon S. Kennedy and US Secret Service agent Helena Harper, are forced to kill him. The pair encounter the real Ada Wong, and Leon learns that National Security Advisor Derek Simmons is affiliated with Neo-Umbrella and was responsible for the attack. Leon and Helena pursue Simmons into Lanshiang, China, while faking their deaths. Meanwhile, Jake and Sherry escape captivity in Lanshiang.\n\nChris returns to duty in the BSAA with Piers and a new team, arriving in a besieged Lanshiang. Chris recovers from his amnesia and seeks revenge against Ada, resulting in casualties for his squad. Chris and Piers confront Ada, until Leon intervenes. After being informed by Leon, Chris and Piers pursue \"Ada\" to an aircraft carrier, destroying cruise missiles laden with the C-virus. Leon, Helena, Sherry, and Jake confront Simmons over his involvement with the outbreaks, where Sherry covertly hands Jake's medical data to Leon in case of their captivity. Leon and Helena corner Simmons, who has been infected by a J'avo, where he confesses to having killed the President to maintain national security. The two see off a mutated Simmons while Sherry and Jake are captured again. Attempting to leave the city, Leon and Helena are warned by Chris that a missile has been launched, but they are too late to stop it. Leon discloses Jake's real identity to Chris and has him rescue Jake and Sherry in a remote oil platform. With Ada's assistance, Leon and Helena kill Simmons.\n\nOn the oil platform, Chris and Piers head underground, freeing Jake and Sherry from captivity before preventing a large-scale attack by a gigantic bioweapon, Haos. Heavily wounded, and in a desperate attempt to save Chris, Piers injects himself with the C-virus to help turn the tide of the battle. He defeats Haos before evacuating. Aware that the mutation will worsen, Piers sacrifices himself by pushing Chris to an escape pod, using his abilities to destroy the base. Meanwhile, Jake and Sherry escape the facility and kill Ustanak as they ride a rocket-powered lift to the surface.\n\nThe imposter Ada was a scientist named Carla Radames, who was forced to transform into Ada by Simmons. The real Ada was aiding Leon and Sherry while destroying the Neo-Umbrella lab in Langshiang. Although presumed dead after being shot by one of Simmons' soldiers, Carla attempts a final attack against Ada, after having injected herself with a powerful dose of the C-virus, but is killed. After aiding Leon and Helena in their battle with Simmons, Ada destroys the lab where her clone was developed, and accepts a new assignment. Leon and Helena are cleared for duty; Chris remains with the BSAA in command of a new squad, overcoming his guilt; Sherry continues her duty as a DSO agent; and Jake starts a new life fighting zombies in an underdeveloped country with his identity covered up by the BSAA.\n\n\"Resident Evil 6\" was conceptualised soon after the release of \"Resident Evil 5\", and entered full development in 2009. \"Resident Evil 5\" producer Jun Takeuchi said that he considered a \"completely new system\" for \"Resident Evil 6\", but ruled out his involvement. In March 2009, co-producer Masachika Kawata stated that the new instalment was not decided upon, but admitted that it could take Capcom four to eight years to develop. Kawata later claimed that the new game will be drastically different from its predecessors. The game was directed by Eiichiro Sasaki, who also directed the \"Resident Evil Outbreak\" series. When development of the game first begun, producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi wanted to revolve the game around the \"ultimate horror entertainment\", bearing in mind that the team considered the upcoming \"Resident Evil 6\" to be the flagship title of the horror genre. In a February 2012 interview, Hirabayashi stated that he went to lengths to balance \"all of the things people love\" about the series, so the team focused to orientate gameplay around horror themes. In March 2012, Capcom admitted that the survival-horror market was too small for \"Resident Evil\", and issued a statement that the development team would instead choose to orientate the gameplay around the action genre.\n\nThe development of the game was led by Hiroyuki Kobayashi, who was stated by Capcom to be aiming to \"deliver the most impressive \"Resident Evil\" title ever both in terms of scope and production values\". Capcom also asserted that the game was meant to take an approach to \"evolve\" the series. The staff wanted to give the game a new setting with Sasaki wishing to place it in China. While the country of Edonia was not modelled from any country in Europe, it was given an Eastern European theme. According to \"Famitsu\", the character of Jake Muller was designed to be \"someone today’s young people can empathize with\". The game had a development staff of more than 600, making it Capcom's largest production to date. The decision to bring back zombies into \"Resident Evil 6\" was made by Kobayashi, who felt that they were a popular component for the franchise, as well as complying per fans' requests. Hirabayashi admitted that the game had radically changed at the end of the development cycle, due to the new concepts it introduced to the series. On 21 August 2012, \"Resident Evil 6\" went gold and initiated its online service.\n\nAn official trailer was released on 19 January 2012. At a Microsoft press briefing at E3 2012, the first gameplay demonstration was shown, depicting Leon and Helena fighting hordes of zombies in China. A playable demo of \"Resident Evil 6\" was scheduled for release on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace on 5 September 2012. Capcom later announced that the demo would become available for both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 owners on 18 September 2012. Early access to the demo was included with \"Dragon's Dogma\". As a result of criticism of the first demo, Capcom brought a different version of the demo to the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, modifying various parts of its gameplay. Originally scheduled to be released on 20 November 2012, the game's release date was pushed forward to 2 October 2012. Prior to the game's launch, several copies of the game were stolen and went on sales in Poland.\n\n\"Resident Evil 6\" was also contained in \"Biohazard Anniversary Package\", a special edition for \"Resident Evil\"s seventeenth anniversary released in Japan on 22 March 2013 alongside the PC version. \"Resident Evil 6\" was re-released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with graphical enhancements and all DLC on 29 March 2016.\n\nIn response to a public backlash over classifying on-disc content as downloadable content (DLC), Capcom released a patch in December 2012 free of charge. The patch included new camera controls, a new difficulty mode named \"No Hope\", an option to play Ada's campaign without having to complete the other three, and the addition of an online co-op partner for Ada's campaign simply called \"Agent\". Unlike any other character in the game, Agent cannot interact with doors and treasure chests; he also disappears when cutscenes are triggered.\n\nOn 18 December 2012, a new multiplayer (DLC) was released with three new multiplayer modes: \"Predator\", \"Survivors\" and \"Onslaught\". Predator mode is a series of quick fire rounds with up to six players who take turns as the fearsome Ustanak and have full access to its weapons. The other players in \"Predator\" mode must avoid capture and being killed by the Ustanak. Human players score points for successful attacks, but also lose points for being caught and/or taken down. This match type is over once all have played as the Ustanak, with the participant with the most points crowned as the winner. Survivors mode is \"Resident Evil\"s take on the classic solo and team based deathmatch mode. Survivors is available for 2-6 players. Onslaught is a two player mode where each must clear waves of oncoming enemies. The twist comes when a player completes a combo chain as this will send enemies over to their opponent’s screen.\n\nOn 4 April 2013, a \"Left 4 Dead 2\" crossover DLC was released for the PC version, adding the main characters and two monsters from \"Left 4 Dead 2\" to the PC-exclusive The Mercenaries: No Mercy mode in \"Resident Evil 6\". Various weapons, characters, and monsters from \"Resident Evil 6\" have also been added as optionally-downloadable replacement skins on the PC version of \"Left 4 Dead 2\".\n\nThe PlayStation 3 version of \"Resident Evil 6\" holds an aggregate score of 74%, PS4 a 60%, Xbox One a 63%, PC a 69%, and the Xbox 360 version a 67% as shown on Metacritic,\n\nCritics praised the storyline, themes, graphics, and artificial intelligence. A reviewer from \"Game Informer\" stated that despite the game did not \"hold back\" the decadent experience from being an \"unhinged flaming rollercoaster ride\". A reviewer from the \"Official Xbox Magazine\" concluded that the game was an accomplished shooter, and a fittingly \"thunderous\" send-off for \"Resident Evil\", while also praising the length and variety of the game. GameTrailers noted the shift away from the style and tone of past games in the series, yet still praised the overall direction, stating that despite the \"old identity stripped away\", the game presented itself as a \"massive\" action game. Richard George of IGN was favourable toward the technical and artistic design of the game, stating that the game was among Capcom’s greatest successes with an \"incredibly strong\" world, lighting, and creature designs. Ryan McCaffrey of IGN also noted the new enemies as \"some of the best\" designs and concepts in the history of the franchise. Hollander Cooper of GamesRadar praised the improvements to the controls over its predecessor, stating that the game had an emphasis placed on fluidity and movement, although noted that the cover system \"never seems to work right\". \"The Escapist\" also praised the improved AI companion that \"does a decent job of backing you up and taking the fight to the enemy rather than just standing by\", however also disliked the cover system, calling it \"the most forgettable new feature of the game\".\n\nThe game's four campaigns received criticism from reviewers. Simon Parkin from Eurogamer was divided over the campaigns, citing Leon's campaign as the strongest and \"the closest we get to the series' survival horror roots\", along with Ada's as having \"diverse flavour\". However, Parkin criticised the other two campaigns, stating that Jake's campaign \"rarely delights\" while citing that Chris' was a \"second-rate third-person sprint\" with \"idiotic\" cutscene dialogue. A reviewer from \"Edge\" also felt that the campaigns noticeably contrasted in quality more than others. Similarly, Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot concluded that the game's campaigns were the ultimate test of patience for \"even the most dedicated\", while Destructoid cited \"Resident Evil 6\" as not only a \"step back\" for the series due to the game's new and unconventional features, but a \"step back for commonplace, unassuming action-shooters\".\n\nIn an interview with the Official PlayStation Blog, \"Resident Evil 6\" executive producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi responded to fan criticism shortly after release, noting the creative differences with fans. He stated \"the fans and us as creators are the two parents [...] and just like real parents, you’re not always going to agree on what is best for raising that child,\" going on to say, \"we want to make sure that what we do pleases them but the initial reaction might not always be positive. We do listen to the fans but we can’t be beholden to them at every turn or I don’t think we’ll ever make progress in terms of the series’ development\".\n\nWhile Capcom has dubbed the game as a \"dramatic horror\", several critics instead noted the game's departure from the survival horror genre compared to previous instalments. Reviewers from GameSpot and GamesRadar noted that the game was no longer considered a survival horror. Destructoid asserted that Capcom had \"abandoned any pretense\" of the survival horror genre. Many reviewers listed the game's genre simply as a third-person action shooter. After the game's release, Capcom's Masachika Kawata considered the possibility of rebooting the franchise back to its \"classic horror roots\".\n\nIn May 2012, Capcom announced they expected the game to sell 7 million copies by the end of the 2012 fiscal year, however the company lowered their expectations to 6 million due to the game's mixed reception. Upon release, Capcom announced that it had shipped 4.5 million copies worldwide, setting a new record for the company. In October 2012, the game sold 806,000 copies in the United States. According to Capcom, sales weakened following the strong start, with the company admitting that the game would not meet their goals, and consequently lowered their financial projections for the fiscal year as a result. The game had sold 4.9 million copies by April 2013, and, by October the same year, had sold 5.2 million copies worldwide, becoming one of Capcom's best-selling video games.\n\nDespite the slow start and mixed reviews, \"Resident Evil 6\" became Capcom's second best-selling title by September 2018, with a lifetime sales of 7.2 million copies worldwide for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. In February 2013, Capcom issued in a statement that the game suffered from poor sales due to various development challenges and \"inadequate organisational collaboration\" across the company. In addition, the PC version of the game sold more than 1.3 million copies on Steam as of September 2017. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions have sold 1.5 million copies as of November 2018. All versions combined have sold over 10 million copies.\n\n"}
{"id": "1076505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1076505", "title": "Roman art", "text": "Roman art\n\nRoman art refers to the visual arts made in Ancient Rome and in the territories of the Roman Empire. Roman art includes architecture, painting, sculpture and mosaic work. Luxury objects in metal-work, gem engraving, ivory carvings, and glass are sometimes considered in modern terms to be minor forms of Roman art, although this would not necessarily have been the case for contemporaries. Sculpture was perhaps considered as the highest form of art by Romans, but figure painting was also very highly regarded. The two forms have had very contrasting rates of survival, with a very large body of sculpture surviving from about the 1st century BC onward, though very little from before, but very little painting at all remains, and probably nothing that a contemporary would have considered to be of the highest quality.\n\nAncient Roman pottery was not a luxury product, but a vast production of \"fine wares\" in \"terra sigillata\" were decorated with reliefs that reflected the latest taste, and provided a large group in society with stylish objects at what was evidently an affordable price. Roman coins were an important means of propaganda, and have survived in enormous numbers.\n\nWhile the traditional view of the ancient Roman artists is that they often borrowed from, and copied Greek precedents (much of the Greek sculptures known today are in the form of Roman marble copies), more recent analysis has indicated that Roman art is a highly creative pastiche relying heavily on Greek models but also encompassing Etruscan, native Italic, and even Egyptian visual culture. Stylistic eclecticism and practical application are the hallmarks of much Roman art.\n\nPliny, Ancient Rome’s most important historian concerning the arts, recorded that nearly all the forms of art – sculpture, landscape, portrait painting, even genre painting – were advanced in Greek times, and in some cases, more advanced than in Rome. Though very little remains of Greek wall art and portraiture, certainly Greek sculpture and vase painting bears this out. These forms were not likely surpassed by Roman artists in fineness of design or execution. As another example of the lost \"Golden Age\", he singled out Peiraikos, \"whose artistry is surpassed by only a very few ... He painted barbershops and shoemakers’ stalls, donkeys, vegetables, and such, and for that reason came to be called the 'painter of vulgar subjects'; yet these works are altogether delightful, and they were sold at higher prices than the greatest paintings of many other artists.” The adjective \"vulgar\" is used here in its original meaning, which means \"common\".\n\nThe Greek antecedents of Roman art were legendary. In the mid-5th century BC, the most famous Greek artists were Polygnotos, noted for his wall murals, and Apollodoros, the originator of chiaroscuro. The development of realistic technique is credited to Zeuxis and Parrhasius, who according to ancient Greek legend, are said to have once competed in a bravura display of their talents, history’s earliest descriptions of trompe l’oeil painting. In sculpture, Skopas, Praxiteles, Phidias, and Lysippos were the foremost sculptors. It appears that Roman artists had much Ancient Greek art to copy from, as trade in art was brisk throughout the empire, and much of the Greek artistic heritage found its way into Roman art through books and teaching. Ancient Greek treatises on the arts are known to have existed in Roman times, though are now lost. Many Roman artists came from Greek colonies and provinces...\nThe high number of Roman copies of Greek art also speaks of the esteem Roman artists had for Greek art, and perhaps of its rarer and higher quality. Many of the art forms and methods used by the Romans – such as high and low relief, free-standing sculpture, bronze casting, vase art, mosaic, cameo, coin art, fine jewelry and metalwork, funerary sculpture, perspective drawing, caricature, genre and portrait painting, landscape painting, architectural sculpture, and trompe l’oeil painting – all were developed or refined by Ancient Greek artists. One exception is the Roman bust, which did not include the shoulders. The traditional head-and-shoulders bust may have been an Etruscan or early Roman form. Virtually every artistic technique and method used by Renaissance artists 1,900 years later, had been demonstrated by Ancient Greek artists, with the notable exceptions of oil colors and mathematically accurate perspective. Where Greek artists were highly revered in their society, most Roman artists were anonymous and considered tradesmen. There is no recording, as in Ancient Greece, of the great masters of Roman art, and practically no signed works. Where Greeks worshiped the aesthetic qualities of great art, and wrote extensively on artistic theory, Roman art was more decorative and indicative of status and wealth, and apparently not the subject of scholars or philosophers.\n\nOwing in part to the fact that the Roman cities were far larger than the Greek city-states in power and population, and generally less provincial, art in Ancient Rome took on a wider, and sometimes more utilitarian, purpose. Roman culture assimilated many cultures and was for the most part tolerant of the ways of conquered peoples. Roman art was commissioned, displayed, and owned in far greater quantities, and adapted to more uses than in Greek times. Wealthy Romans were more materialistic; they decorated their walls with art, their home with decorative objects, and themselves with fine jewelry.\n\nIn the Christian era of the late Empire, from 350 to 500 CE, wall painting, mosaic ceiling and floor work, and funerary sculpture thrived, while full-sized sculpture in the round and panel painting died out, most likely for religious reasons. When Constantine moved the capital of the empire to Byzantium (renamed Constantinople), Roman art incorporated Eastern influences to produce the Byzantine style of the late empire. When Rome was sacked in the 5th century, artisans moved to and found work in the Eastern capital. The Church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople employed nearly 10,000 workmen and artisans, in a final burst of Roman art under Emperor Justinian (527–565 CE), who also ordered the creation of the famous mosaics of Basilica of San Vitale in the city of Ravenna.\n\nOf the vast body of Roman painting we now have only a very few pockets of survivals, with many documented types not surviving at all, or doing so only from the very end of the period. The best known and most important pocket is the wall paintings from Pompeii, Herculaneum and other sites nearby, which show how residents of a wealthy seaside resort decorated their walls in the century or so before the fatal eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE. A succession of dated styles have been defined and analysed by modern art historians beginning with August Mau, showing increasing elaboration and sophistication.\n\nStarting in the 3rd century CE and finishing by about 400 we have a large body of paintings from the Catacombs of Rome, by no means all Christian, showing the later continuation of the domestic decorative tradition in a version adapted - probably not greatly adapted - for use in burial chambers, in what was probably a rather humbler social milieu than the largest houses in Pompeii. Much of Nero's palace in Rome, the Domus Aurea, survived as grottos and gives us examples which we can be sure represent the very finest quality of wall-painting in its style, and which may well have represented significant innovation in style. There are a number of other parts of painted rooms surviving from Rome and elsewhere, which somewhat help to fill in the gaps of our knowledge of wall-painting. From Roman Egypt there are a large number of what are known as Fayum mummy portraits, bust portraits on wood added to the outside of mummies by a Romanized middle class; despite their very distinct local character they are probably broadly representative of Roman style in painted portraits, which are otherwise entirely lost.\n\nNothing remains of the Greek paintings imported to Rome during the 4th and 5th centuries, or of the painting on wood done in Italy during that period. In sum, the range of samples is confined to only about 200 years out of the about 900 years of Roman history, and of provincial and decorative painting. Most of this wall painting was done using the secco (“dry”) method, but some fresco paintings also existed in Roman times. There is evidence from mosaics and a few inscriptions that some Roman paintings were adaptations or copies of earlier Greek works. However, adding to the confusion is the fact that inscriptions may be recording the names of immigrant Greek artists from Roman times, not from Ancient Greek originals that were copied. The Romans entirely lacked a tradition of figurative vase-painting comparable to that of the Ancient Greeks, which the Etruscans had emulated.\n\nRoman painting provides a wide variety of themes: animals, still life, scenes from everyday life, portraits, and some mythological subjects. During the Hellenistic period, it evoked the pleasures of the countryside and represented scenes of shepherds, herds, rustic temples, rural mountainous landscapes and country houses. Erotic scenes are also relatively common. In the late empire, after 200AD, early Christian themes mixed with pagan imagery survive on catacomb walls.\n\nThe main innovation of Roman painting compared to Greek art was the development of landscapes, in particular incorporating techniques of perspective, though true mathematical perspective developed 1,500 years later. Surface textures, shading, and coloration are well applied but scale and spatial depth was still not rendered accurately. Some landscapes were pure scenes of nature, particularly gardens with flowers and trees, while others were architectural vistas depicting urban buildings. Other landscapes show episodes from mythology, the most famous demonstrating scenes from the \"Odyssey\".\n\nIn the traditional view, the art of the ancient East would have known landscape painting only as the backdrop to civil or military narrative scenes. This theory, defended by Franz Wickhoff, is debatable. It is possible to see evidence of Greek knowledge of landscape portrayal in Plato's \"Critias\" (107b–108b): ... and if we look at the portraiture of divine and of human bodies as executed by painters, in respect of the ease or difficulty with which they succeed in imitating their subjects in the opinion of onlookers, we shall notice in the first place that as regards the earth and mountains and rivers and woods and the whole of heaven, with the things that exist and move therein, we are content if a man is able to represent them with even a small degree of likeness ...\n\nRoman still life subjects are often placed in illusionist niches or shelves and depict a variety of everyday objects including fruit, live and dead animals, seafood, and shells. Examples of the theme of the glass jar filled with water were skillfully painted and later served as models for the same subject often painted during the Renaissance and Baroque periods.\n\nPliny complained of the declining state of Roman portrait art, \"The painting of portraits which used to transmit through the ages the accurate likenesses of people, has entirely gone out ... Indolence has destroyed the arts.\"\n\nIn Greece and Rome, wall painting was not considered as high art. The most prestigious form of art besides sculpture was panel painting, i.e. tempera or encaustic painting on wooden panels. Unfortunately, since wood is a perishable material, only a very few examples of such paintings have survived, namely the Severan Tondo from c. 200 AD, a very routine official portrait from some provincial government office, and the well-known Fayum mummy portraits, all from Roman Egypt, and almost certainly not of the highest contemporary quality. The portraits were attached to burial mummies at the face, from which almost all have now been detached. They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally. The background is always monochrome, sometimes with decorative elements. In terms of artistic tradition, the images clearly derive more from Greco-Roman traditions than Egyptian ones. They are remarkably realistic, though variable in artistic quality, and may indicate that similar art which was widespread elsewhere but did not survive. A few portraits painted on glass and medals from the later empire have survived, as have coin portraits, some of which are considered very realistic as well.\n\nGold glass, or gold sandwich glass, was a technique for fixing a layer of gold leaf with a design between two fused layers of glass, developed in Hellenistic glass and revived in the 3rd century AD. There are a very few large designs, including a very fine group of portraits from the 3rd century with added paint, but the great majority of the around 500 survivals are roundels that are the cut-off bottoms of wine cups or glasses used to mark and decorate graves in the Catacombs of Rome by pressing them into the mortar. They predominantly date from the 4th and 5th centuries. Most are Christian, though there are many pagan and a few Jewish examples. It is likely that they were originally given as gifts on marriage, or festive occasions such as New Year. Their iconography has been much studied, although artistically they are relatively unsophisticated. Their subjects are similar to the catacomb paintings, but with a difference balance including more portraiture. As time went on there was an increase in the depiction of saints. The same technique began to be used for gold tesserae for mosaics in the mid-1st century in Rome, and by the 5th century these had become the standard background for religious mosaics.\n\nThe earlier group are \"among the most vivid portraits to survive from Early Christian times. They stare out at us with an extraordinary stern and melancholy intensity\", and represent the best surviving indications of what high quality Roman portraiture could achieve in paint. The Gennadios medallion in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, is a fine example of an Alexandrian portrait on blue glass, using a rather more complex technique and naturalistic style than most Late Roman examples, including painting onto the gold to create shading, and with the Greek inscription showing local dialect features. He had perhaps been given or commissioned the piece to celebrate victory in a musical competition. One of the most famous Alexandrian-style portrait medallions, with an inscription in Egyptian Greek, was later mounted in an Early Medieval crux gemmata in Brescia, in the mistaken belief that it showed the pious empress and Gothic queen Galla Placida and her children; in fact the knot in the central figure's dress may mark a devotee of Isis. This is one of a group of 14 pieces dating to the 3rd century AD, all individualized secular portraits of high quality. The inscription on the medallion is written in the Alexandrian dialect of Greek and hence most likely depicts a family from Roman Egypt. The medallion has also been compared to other works of contemporaneous Roman-Egyptian artwork, such as the Fayum mummy portraits. It is thought that the tiny detail of pieces such as these can only have been achieved using lenses. The later glasses from the catacombs have a level of portraiture that is rudimentary, with features, hairstyles and clothes all following stereotypical styles.\n\nRoman genre scenes generally depict Romans at leisure and include gambling, music and sexual encounters. Some scenes depict gods and goddesses at leisure.\n\nFrom the 3rd century BC, a specific genre known as \"Triumphal Paintings\" appeared, as indicated by Pliny (XXXV, 22). These were paintings which showed triumphal entries after military victories, represented episodes from the war, and conquered regions and cities. Summary maps were drawn to highlight key points of the campaign.\nJosephus describes the painting executed on the occasion of Vespasian and Titus's sack of Jerusalem:\n\nThese paintings have disappeared, but they likely influenced the composition of the historical reliefs carved on military sarcophagi, the Arch of Titus, and Trajan's Column. This evidence underscores the significance of landscape painting, which sometimes tended towards being perspective plans.\n\nRanuccio also describes the oldest painting to be found in Rome, in a tomb on the Esquiline Hill:\n\nThis episode is difficult to pinpoint. One of Ranuccio's hypotheses is that it refers to a victory of the consul Fabius Maximus Rullianus during the second war against Samnites in 326 BC. The presentation of the figures with sizes proportional to their importance is typically Roman, and finds itself in plebeian reliefs. This painting is in the infancy of triumphal painting, and would have been accomplished by the beginning of the 3rd century BC to decorate the tomb.\n\nEarly Roman art was influenced by the art of Greece and that of the neighbouring Etruscans, themselves greatly influenced by their Greek trading partners. An Etruscan speciality was near life size tomb effigies in terracotta, usually lying on top of a sarcophagus lid propped up on one elbow in the pose of a diner in that period. As the expanding Roman Republic began to conquer Greek territory, at first in Southern Italy and then the entire Hellenistic world except for the Parthian far east, official and patrician sculpture became largely an extension of the Hellenistic style, from which specifically Roman elements are hard to disentangle, especially as so much Greek sculpture survives only in copies of the Roman period. By the 2nd century BC, \"most of the sculptors working in Rome\" were Greek, often enslaved in conquests such as that of Corinth (146 BC), and sculptors continued to be mostly Greeks, often slaves, whose names are very rarely recorded. Vast numbers of Greek statues were imported to Rome, whether as booty or the result of extortion or commerce, and temples were often decorated with re-used Greek works.\n\nA native Italian style can be seen in the tomb monuments of prosperous middle-class Romans, which very often featured portrait busts, and portraiture is arguably the main strength of Roman sculpture. There are no survivals from the tradition of masks of ancestors that were worn in processions at the funerals of the great families and otherwise displayed in the home, but many of the busts that survive must represent ancestral figures, perhaps from the large family tombs like the Tomb of the Scipios or the later mausolea outside the city. The famous bronze head supposedly of Lucius Junius Brutus is very variously dated, but taken as a very rare survival of Italic style under the Republic, in the preferred medium of bronze. Similarly stern and forceful heads are seen in the coins of the consuls, and in the Imperial period coins as well as busts sent around the Empire to be placed in the basilicas of provincial cities were the main visual form of imperial propaganda; even Londinium had a near-colossal statue of Nero, though far smaller than the 30 metre high Colossus of Nero in Rome, now lost. The Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker, a successful freedman (c. 50-20 BC) has a frieze that is an unusually large example of the \"plebeian\" style. Imperial portraiture was initially Hellenized and highly idealized, as in the Blacas Cameo and other portraits of Augustus.\nThe Romans did not generally attempt to compete with free-standing Greek works of heroic exploits from history or mythology, but from early on produced historical works in relief, culminating in the great Roman triumphal columns with continuous narrative reliefs winding around them, of which those commemorating Trajan (113 CE) and Marcus Aurelius (by 193) survive in Rome, where the Ara Pacis (\"Altar of Peace\", 13 BC) represents the official Greco-Roman style at its most classical and refined, and the Sperlonga sculptures it at its most baroque. Some late Roman public sculptures developed a massive, simplified style that sometimes anticipates Soviet socialist realism. Among other major examples are the earlier re-used reliefs on the Arch of Constantine and the base of the Column of Antoninus Pius (161), Campana reliefs were cheaper pottery versions of marble reliefs and the taste for relief was from the imperial period expanded to the sarcophagus.\n\nAll forms of luxury small sculpture continued to be patronized, and quality could be extremely high, as in the silver Warren Cup, glass Lycurgus Cup, and large cameos like the Gemma Augustea, Gonzaga Cameo and the \"Great Cameo of France\". For a much wider section of the population, moulded relief decoration of pottery vessels and small figurines were produced in great quantity and often considerable quality.\n\nAfter moving through a late 2nd century \"baroque\" phase, in the 3rd century, Roman art largely abandoned, or simply became unable to produce, sculpture in the classical tradition, a change whose causes remain much discussed. Even the most important imperial monuments now showed stumpy, large-eyed figures in a harsh frontal style, in simple compositions emphasizing power at the expense of grace. The contrast is famously illustrated in the Arch of Constantine of 315 in Rome, which combines sections in the new style with roundels in the earlier full Greco-Roman style taken from elsewhere, and the \"Four Tetrarchs\" (c. 305) from the new capital of Constantinople, now in Venice. Ernst Kitzinger found in both monuments the same \"stubby proportions, angular movements, an ordering of parts through symmetry and repetition and a rendering of features and drapery folds through incisions rather than modelling... The hallmark of the style wherever it appears consists of an emphatic hardness, heaviness and angularity – in short, an almost complete rejection of the classical tradition\".\n\nThis revolution in style shortly preceded the period in which Christianity was adopted by the Roman state and the great majority of the people, leading to the end of large religious sculpture, with large statues now only used for emperors, as in the famous fragments of a colossal acrolithic statue of Constantine, and the 4th or 5th century Colossus of Barletta. However rich Christians continued to commission reliefs for sarcophagi, as in the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus, and very small sculpture, especially in ivory, was continued by Christians, building on the style of the consular diptych.\n\nTraditional Roman sculpture is divided into five categories: portraiture, historical relief, funerary reliefs, sarcophagi, and copies of ancient Greek works. Contrary to the belief of early archaeologists, many of these sculptures were large polychrome terra-cotta images, such as the Apollo of Veii (Villa Givlia, Rome), but the painted surface of many of them has worn away with time.\n\nWhile Greek sculptors traditionally illustrated military exploits through the use of mythological allegory, the Romans used a more documentary style. Roman reliefs of battle scenes, like those on the Column of Trajan, were created for the glorification of Roman might, but also provide first-hand representation of military costumes and military equipment. Trajan's column records the various Dacian wars conducted by Trajan in what is modern day Romania. It is the foremost example of Roman historical relief and one of the great artistic treasures of the ancient world. This unprecedented achievement, over 650 foot of spiraling length, presents not just realistically rendered individuals (over 2,500 of them), but landscapes, animals, ships, and other elements in a continuous visual history – in effect an ancient precursor of a documentary movie. It survived destruction when it was adapted as a base for Christian sculpture. During the Christian era after 300 AD, the decoration of door panels and sarcophagi continued but full-sized sculpture died out and did not appear to be an important element in early churches.\n\nThe Romans inherited a tradition of art in a wide range of the so-called \"minor arts\" or decorative art. Most of these flourished most impressively at the luxury level, but large numbers of terracotta figurines, both religious and secular, continued to be produced cheaply, as well as some larger Campana reliefs in terracotta. Roman art did not use vase-painting in the way of the ancient Greeks, but vessels in Ancient Roman pottery were often stylishly decorated in moulded relief. Producers of the millions of small oil lamps sold seem to have relied on attractive decoration to beat competitors and every subject of Roman art except landscape and portraiture is found on them in miniature.\n\nLuxury arts included fancy Roman glass in a great range of techniques, many smaller types of which were probably affordable to a good proportion of the Roman public. This was certainly not the case for the most extravagant types of glass, such as the cage cups or \"diatreta\", of which the Lycurgus Cup in the British Museum is a near-unique figurative example in glass that changes colour when seen with light passing through it. The Augustan Portland Vase is the masterpiece of Roman cameo glass, and imitated the style of the large engraved gems (Blacas Cameo, Gemma Augustea, Great Cameo of France) and other hardstone carvings that were also most popular around this time.\n\nRoman mosaic was a minor art, though often on a very large scale, until the very end of the period, when late-4th-century Christians began to use it for large religious images on walls in their new large churches; in earlier Roman art mosaic was mainly used for floors, curved ceilings, and inside and outside walls that were going to get wet. The famous copy of a Hellenistic painting in the \"Alexander Mosaic\" in Naples was originally placed in a floor in Pompeii; this is much higher quality work than most Roman mosaic, though very fine panels, often of still life subjects in small or micromosaic tesserae have also survived. The Romans distinguished between normal \"opus tessellatum\" with \"tesserae\" mostly over 4 mm across, which was laid down on site, and finer \"opus vermiculatum\" for small panels, which is thought to have been produced offsite in a workshop, and brought to the site as a finished panel. The latter was a Hellenistic genre which is found in Italy between about 100 BC and 100 AD. Most signed mosaics have Greek names, suggesting the artists remained mostly Greek, though probably often slaves trained up in workshops. The late 2nd century BC Nile mosaic of Palestrina is a very large example of the popular genre of Nilotic landscape, while the 4th century Gladiator Mosaic in Rome shows several large figures in combat. Orpheus mosaics, often very large, were another favourite subject for villas, with several ferocious animals tamed by Orpheus's playing music. In the transition to Byzantine art, hunting scenes tended to take over large animal scenes.\n\nMetalwork was highly developed, and clearly an essential part of the homes of the rich, who dined off silver, while often drinking from glass, and had elaborate cast fittings on their furniture, jewellery, and small figurines. A number of important hoards found in the last 200 years, mostly from the more violent edges of the late empire, have given us a much clearer idea of Roman silver plate. The Mildenhall Treasure and Hoxne Hoard are both from East Anglia in England. There are few survivals of upmarket ancient Roman furniture, but these show refined and elegant design and execution.\n\nFew Roman coins reach the artistic peaks of the best Greek coins, but they survive in vast numbers and their iconography and inscriptions form a crucial source for the study of Roman history, and the development of imperial iconography, as well as containing many fine examples of portraiture. They penetrated to the rural population of the whole Empire and beyond, with barbarians on the fringes of the Empire making their own copies. In the Empire medallions in precious metals began to be produced in small editions as imperial gifts, which are similar to coins, though larger and usually finer in execution. Images in coins initially followed Greek styles, with gods and symbols, but in the death throes of the Republic first Pompey and then Julius Caesar appeared on coins, and portraits of the emperor or members of his family became standard on imperial coinage. The inscriptions were used for propaganda, and in the later Empire the army joined the emperor as the beneficiary.\n\nIt was in the area of architecture that Roman art produced its greatest innovations. Because the Roman Empire extended over so great of an area and included so many urbanized areas, Roman engineers developed methods for city building on a grand scale, including the use of concrete. Massive buildings like the Pantheon and the Colosseum could never have been constructed with previous materials and methods. Though concrete had been invented a thousand years earlier in the Near East, the Romans extended its use from fortifications to their most impressive buildings and monuments, capitalizing on the material’s strength and low cost. The concrete core was covered with a plaster, brick, stone, or marble veneer, and decorative polychrome and gold-gilded sculpture was often added to produce a dazzling effect of power and wealth.\n\nBecause of these methods, Roman architecture is legendary for the durability of its construction; with many buildings still standing, and some still in use, mostly buildings converted to churches during the Christian era. Many ruins, however, have been stripped of their marble veneer and are left with their concrete core exposed, thus appearing somewhat reduced in size and grandeur from their original appearance, such as with the Basilica of Constantine.\n\nDuring the Republican era, Roman architecture combined Greek and Etruscan elements, and produced innovations such as the round temple and the curved arch. As Roman power grew in the early empire, the first emperors inaugurated wholesale leveling of slums to build grand palaces on the Palatine Hill and nearby areas, which required advances in engineering methods and large scale design. Roman buildings were then built in the commercial, political, and social grouping known as a forum, that of Julius Caesar being the first and several added later, with the Forum Romanum being the most famous. The greatest arena in the Roman world, the Colosseum, was completed around 80 AD at the far end of that forum. It held over 50,000 spectators, had retractable fabric coverings for shade, and could stage massive spectacles including huge gladiatorial contests and mock naval battles. This masterpiece of Roman architecture epitomizes Roman engineering efficiency and incorporates all three architectural orders – Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. Less celebrated but just as important if not more so for most Roman citizens, was the five-story \"insula\" or city block, the Roman equivalent of an apartment building, which housed tens of thousands of Romans.\n\nIt was during the reign of Trajan (98–117 AD.) and Hadrian (117–138 AD) that the Roman Empire reached its greatest extent and that Rome itself was at the peak of its artistic glory – achieved through massive building programs of monuments, meeting houses, gardens, aqueducts, baths, palaces, pavilions, sarcophagi, and temples. The Roman use of the arch, the use of concrete building methods, the use of the dome all permitted construction of vaulted ceilings and enabled the building of these public spaces and complexes, including the palaces, public baths and basilicas of the \"Golden Age\" of the empire. Outstanding examples of dome construction include the Pantheon, the Baths of Diocletian, and the Baths of Caracalla. The Pantheon (dedicated to all the planetary gods) is the best preserved temple of ancient times with an intact ceiling featuring an open \"eye\" in the center. The height of the ceiling exactly equals the interior diameter of the building, creating an enclosure that could contain giant sphere. These grand buildings later served as inspirational models for architects of the Italian Renaissance, such as Brunelleschi. By the age of Constantine (306-337 AD), the last great building programs in Rome took place, including the erection of the Arch of Constantine built near the Colosseum, which recycled some stone work from the forum nearby, to produce an eclectic mix of styles.\n\nRoman aqueducts, also based on the arch, were commonplace in the empire and essential transporters of water to large urban areas. Their standing masonry remains are especially impressive, such as the Pont du Gard (featuring three tiers of arches) and the aqueduct of Segovia, serving as mute testimony to their quality of their design and construction.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3665145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3665145", "title": "Rule of three (writing)", "text": "Rule of three (writing)\n\nThe rule of three is a writing principle that suggests that a trio of events or characters is more humorous, satisfying, or effective than other numbers in execution of the story and engaging the reader. The reader or audience of this form of text is also thereby more likely to remember the information conveyed. This is because having three entities combines both brevity and rhythm with having the smallest amount of information to create a pattern. It makes the author or speaker appear knowledgeable while being both simple and catchy.\n\nSlogans, film titles and a variety of other things have been structured in threes, a tradition that grew out of oral storytelling. Examples include the Three Little Pigs, Three Billy Goats Gruff, and the Three Musketeers. Similarly, adjectives are often grouped in threes to emphasize an idea.\n\nThe Latin phrase \"omne trium perfectum\" (everything that comes in threes is perfect, or, every set of three is complete) conveys the same idea as the rule of three.\n\nThe rule of three can refer to a collection of three words, phrases, sentences, lines, paragraphs/stanzas, chapters/sections of writing and even whole books. The three elements together are known as a triad. The technique may be used not just in prose but poetry, oral storytelling, films and advertising. In photography, the rule of thirds produces a similar effect by dividing an image into three vertically and horizontally.\n\nA tricolon is a more specific use of the rule of three where three words or phrases are equal in length and grammatical form.\n\nA hendiatris is a figure of speech where three successive words are used to express a single central idea. As a slogan or motto, this is known as a tripartite motto.\n\nMany advertising campaigns and public information slogans use the technique to create a catchy, memorable way of displaying information. In marketing theory, American advertising and sales pioneer St. Elmo Lewis laid out his three chief copywriting principles, which he felt were crucial for effective advertising:\n\n\"The mission of an advertisement is to attract a reader so that he will look at the advertisement and start to read it; then to interest him, so that he will continue to read it; then to convince him, so that when he has read it he will believe it. If an advertisement contains these three qualities of success, it is a successful advertisement.\"\n\nBetter-known examples include:\n\nIn comedy, it is also called a \"comic triple\". The third element is often used to create an effect of surprise with an audience, especially if it differs from the first two. For instance, jokes might feature three stereotyped individuals—such as an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman; or a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead—where the surprise or punchline of the joke comes from the third character.\n\nIn storytelling, authors often create triplets or structures in three parts. In its simplest form, this is merely \"beginning, middle, and end\", from Aristotle's Poetics. Syd Field wrote a popular handbook of screenwriting, in which he touted the advantages of three-act structure over the more traditional five-act structure used by William Shakespeare and many other famous playwrights.\n\nVladimir Propp, in his \"Morphology of the Folk Tale\", concluded that any of the elements in a folktale could be negated twice so that it would repeat thrice. This is common not only in the Russian tales he studied but throughout folk tales and fairy tales: most commonly, perhaps, in that the youngest son is usually the third, although fairy tales often display the rule of three in the most blatant form. A small sample of the latter includes:\n\n\nThe use of a series of three elements is also a well-known feature of public oratory. Max Atkinson, in his book on oratory entitled \"Our Masters' Voices\", gives interesting examples of how public speakers use three-part phrases to generate what he calls 'claptraps', evoking audience applause.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr., the civil rights activist and preacher, was known for his uses of tripling and the rule of three throughout his many influential speeches. For example, the speech \"Non-Violence and Racial Justice\" contained a binary opposition made up of the rule of three: \"insult, injustice and exploitation\", followed a few lines later by \"justice, good will, and brotherhood\". Conversely, segregationist Alabama governor George Wallace inveighed: \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\" during his 1963 inaugural address.\n\nThe appeal of the three-fold pattern is also illustrated by the transformation of Winston Churchill's reference to \"blood, toil, tears and sweat\" (echoing Garibaldi and Theodore Roosevelt) in popular recollection to \"blood, sweat and tears\". Similarly, Thomas Hobbes' \"Leviathan\" describes the importance of community, without which life would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\". This has been reduced to the commonly heard triad \"nasty, brutish and short\".\n\nThe Welsh Triads and Irish Triads suggest the use of three's was also a mnemonic device—easy-to-learn verses that were pointers to other information also committed to memory by Druids.\n\nA common feature of legal documents which give property or grant rights as drafted by legal professionals perpetuates old English practice in which the rule of three echoes the intended Act by the varying restatement of the act in triplicate. For example, in a Will or Trust instrument the phrase \"I give, devise and bequeath ...\"\n\nUsually (in court) a common example is quoted: \"tell us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\n\n"}
{"id": "55776438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55776438", "title": "Saka guru", "text": "Saka guru\n\nSaka guru, or soko guru in Javanese, is the four main posts which supported certain Javanese buildings, e.g. the pendopo, the house proper and the mosque. The saka guru is the most fundamental element in Javanese architecture because it supports the entire roof of the building. Because of its importance, the saka guru is imbued with symbolism and treated with certain rituals. \n\nThe saka guru construction is employed in buildings that are constructed with a joglo-type or tajug-type (pyramidal) roofs. The joglo type roof is only reserved for the house of the nobles, while the tajug-type roof is used to support sacred buildings e.g. mosques or temples. In Javanese architecture, walls are merely boundaries of room and the exterior with no structural purposes. The main structural columns/posts of a Javanese house (the saka guru) supports directly the roof and not the wall. Each of these four main posts sits on top of an \"umpak\", three-dimensional trapezoidal stone which acts as a transition between the post and foundation. Umpak size varies from 20 x 20 cm to more than a square meter, depending on the dimension of the posts, which commonly ranges between 12 x 12 cm to 40 x 40 cm. Umpak prevents the wooden post from the infiltration of groundwater, and reduces the horizontal forces caused by earthquakes. \n\nDuring the construction of the saka guru, the northeast \"umpak\" is the first stone to be placed on site. This \"umpak\" is designed to look like the padma flower, imbuing it with the quality of strength. The next \"umpak\" to be placed is the southeast \"umpak\", followed by northwest, and finally the southwest. The wooden posts are always placed according to the direction of tree growth. After the saka guru is completely erected, in the evening an offering ceremony is held. \n\nEach wooden post of the saka guru has pens at both ends; the bottom pen fixes the post into the \"umpak\"; the top pen (\"purus pathok\" (the pile pen)) plugs into the hole of the two main beams. The first beam to be set is the \"pengeret\" (literally \"cross beam\"), then the second beam \"blandar\" (literally \"beam\") is set on top of the \"pengeret\". The two beams lock together, receiving compression forces of the saka guru structure. \n\nEach wooden post of the saka guru also contains a hole at the upper portion, to be filled by the pen of secondary beams. The first beam is known as \"sunduk\" (\"skewer\") which also contains a pen known as \"purus wedokan\" (\"female pen\"). The pen \"purus wedokan\" contains a hole which will be locked by a pen of a second beam after it is inserted into the saka guru. The second beam is known as \"kili\" (\"anchor\"), while its pen is known as \"purus lanang\" (\"male pen\"). The structural element of \"kili\" and \"sunduk' stabilizes the saka guru structure. The Javanese term for pen is \"purus\" meaning the male sex organ.\n\nUpon the completion of all the plug-in procedure, the saka guru is stable and can support the roof on top of it. Two or three parallel beams join the post at its top. The posts may directly support roof trusses or roof beams. In the case of joglo, the main posts are usually topped by two sets of inward stepped wooden piles, \"tumpang sari\", and outward stepped piles, \"elar\". The number of steps in a \"tumpang sari\" reveals the status of the owner. \n\nThe \"usur-duduk\" is hip rafter running from an external corner to the ridge that is called traditionally as \"molo\". \n\nSaka guru consists of the word \"saka\" and \"guru\". According to the Javanese text of Kawruh Kalang, the \"guru\" or \"teacher\" is a title given to the four wooden beams, while \"saka\" or \"post\" is for the four main posts. Thus the whole configuration is known as \"sakaguru\", or more correctly \"sakaning guru\" or \"saka ingkang nyanggi guru\" (Javanese \"the \"saka\" which supports the \"guru\").\n\nIn Indonesian language, the term saka guru is used to signifies a fundamental principle. For example, \"the Indonesian Cooperative is the saka guru of the National Economy\".\n\nThe space beneath the saka guru was considered a very important sacred space. In modern day, the area has no specific usage, but traditionally, this area was where incense was burnt once a week to honor the rice goddess Sri. The space below the tumpang sari is also the place where the bride and bridegroom are seated during their marriage ceremony. \n\n\n"}

The episode was first broadcast on BBC One, PBS, Channel One and 1+1 on 15 January 2017.\n\nA panic-stricken little girl wakes up on an aeroplane and finds everybody asleep. She picks a mobile phone up and hears Jim Moriarty announce \"Welcome to the Final Problem\".\n\nMycroft Holmes is at home where Sherlock and Watson disable his home security to trick him into revealing his sister, Eurus, exists. At 221b Baker Street, Mycroft explains that Eurus was an era-defining genius on par with Sir Isaac Newton, with abilities far greater than Sherlock's and Mycroft's, coupled with a total lack of empathy. Mycroft reveals that their parents sent Eurus to a mental institution after she kidnapped and drowned Sherlock's dog Redbeard, and after she burned their home down. Mycroft withheld this from Sherlock because Eurus had psychologically traumatized him as a child, leading to Sherlock suppressing his memories of her. An adult Mycroft then sent her to a maximum-security facility in the North Sea, Sherrinford, and told their parents that she had died. When Mycroft insists that she is secured, a quadcopter carrying a motion-activated grenade flies into Sherlock's flat. John, Sherlock, and Mycroft flee as the bomb detonates.\n\nLater, John and Sherlock hijack a fishing trawler to travel to Sherrinford and carry a diversion plan out so that Sherlock can reach Eurus' cell. Mycroft and John corner the prison governor, discovering that he has explicitly disobeyed Mycroft's protocol and has allowed Eurus to interact with prison staff. Using her skill to manipulate everyone she speaks with, Eurus has effectively taken full control of the prison. Meanwhile, Sherlock talks to Eurus, but she attacks him and knocks him unconscious. The guards lock Sherlock, John, Mycroft, and the governor together in Eurus's old cell.\n\nMycroft reveals that five years ago, he granted Eurus five unsupervised minutes with Moriarty as a Christmas present in exchange for detecting national security threats to Britain. During this time, Moriarty agreed to record video messages for her. In the present day, Eurus leads the captives in a series of psychological ordeals, forcing Sherlock into sinister games to save lives while videos of Moriarty heckle him. Although Eurus forces Sherlock onward with the prospect of saving the girl on the aeroplane, he eventually stops the games by threatening to shoot himself when she orders him to shoot either John or Mycroft. Furious, Eurus uses tranquilliser darts on the three of them.\n\nSherlock wakes up near his family's old house. He speaks to the girl in the aeroplane to try to guide her in landing safely. John wakes up at the bottom of a well. When he finds human bones there, Sherlock realizes that what he thought was his dog Redbeard was in fact his best friend, Victor Trevor. Eurus threw him into the well and left him for dead because she felt left out of Sherlock's attention as a child. Sherlock then deciphers the real meaning of the song that Eurus originally taunted him with when Victor went missing, which reveals that she wants him to find her. Sherlock deduces that the girl in the plane is actually Eurus's mental metaphor and that the game has been a cry for help. With Eurus' puzzle solved, Sherlock is able to send her back to Sherrinford after rescuing John.\n\nMycroft explains to his and Sherlock's parents, who are angry that they had been told that Eurus was dead, that she refuses to speak to people anymore. Sherlock frequently visits her and they play the violin together, giving performances for their parents and Mycroft. While helping Sherlock repair his destroyed flat, John receives a video sent by Mary before she died, encouraging him to continue working with Sherlock.\n\nThe title of the episode is a reference to \"The Final Problem\" (1893). The episode was partially based on \"The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual\" (1893), which it directly references. Watson's mention of the east wind and the name of Eurus Holmes are a reference to \"His Last Bow\" (1917), where Holmes says, \"There's an east wind coming, Watson.\" The three Garrideb brothers seen in a puzzle sequence are an adaptation of \"The Adventure of the Three Garridebs\" (1924). The character Victor Trevor is a reference to \"The Adventure of the \"Gloria Scott\"\" (1893), where he appears as Holmes' first ever close friend, albeit in university rather than in childhood. Jim Moriarty's brother is mentioned as a broadcast station master, a reference to \"The Valley of Fear\" (1915), where James Moriarty's brother is noted to be a railway station master. The message on the coffin lid is a reference to \"The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax\" (1911). The closing shot shows Holmes and Watson exiting \"Rathbone Place\", a reference to Basil Rathbone, who played Sherlock Holmes in fourteen films and a radio series. In the final sequence, \"The Adventure of the Dancing Men\" (1903) is referenced with the following cipher seen on a chalkboard, which reads \"AM HERE ABE SLANEY\":\n\nThe setting for Sherrinford, the high-security prison, was filmed at St Catherine's Fort, St Catherine's Island off Castle Beach in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, Wales.\n\nMusician Paul Weller made a cameo appearance, in a non-speaking role as a man lying on the floor in a Viking costume, seen near the end of the episode.\n\nOn 14 January, one day before the episode's broadcast, it was released online with Russian dialogue. Both the official \"Sherlock\" Twitter account and members of the \"Sherlock\" team acknowledged this and asked people to not share it and keep the Internet free of spoilers.\n\nOn 16 January Channel One Russia, the network holding the rights to the broadcast in Russia, issued an apology, having determined that the material had been hacked from their system. Channel One Russia announced it was conducting an investigation, while BBC, through BBC Worldwide, announced its own full-scale investigation of the leak.\n\n\"The Final Problem\" received mixed reviews from critics. Among the more positive reviews was Sean O'Grady of \"The Independent\" who gave the episode four out of five stars, stating that \"Benedict Cumberbatch and Tim Freeman are their usual accomplished double act\" although suggesting \"Maybe Sherlock needs a little more reimagining\". Meanwhile, Michael Hogan of \"The Daily Telegraph\" gave the episode five out of five stars, praising that \"the dazzling script delivered laughs, excitement, and emotion .. we were left with a wiser Holmes and Watson.\" He also commented about the possibility of series 4 being the last series for Sherlock, stating \"if this was the last-ever episode, which it surely won't be, it worked well as a sign off.\" Louisa Mellor of \"Den of Geek\" wrote \"this was fun to watch. Fun and ultra-tense with a terrific, whooshing sense of momentum. It went like the clappers, held its breath, went like the clappers again, held its breath some more until you thought you might pass out with the dizziness.\" Neela Debnath of the \"Daily Express\" was also positive, writing \"I can't fault the thrill ride that The Final Problem takes viewers on from the begin to the end. Sherlock has clawed itself back from the edge.\" Two separate reviews in \"The Observer\" or \"The Guardian\" were positive, with one describing it as too byzantine, but \"much better than it looked\" and the other writing \"with a visual swagger far beyond the budget – and including an eerily beautiful high-security violin duet for Sherlock and Eurus – this was a fine way to go.\"\n\nHowever, some reviews were more critical. A third \"Guardian\" review was negative, stating Holmes had \"become a parody of himself\". Kaite Welsh of IndieWire scored the episode a grade of B-, writing \"Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss wrap up their 13th episode on an elegiac note, musing on the legend that is Sherlock and Watson. It's just a shame the rest of the episode was such a mess, really\". Ian Hyland of \"The Daily Mirror\" stated that he preferred it \"when Holmes and Watson were just solving fairly believable mysteries. If it went back to that I'd welcome another series or two with open arms.\" He compared the series to the BBC series \"Taboo\", suggesting that the latter would be a better television series for those who love Sherlock. Aja Romano of Vox also criticized the episode, praising the usual drama of Sherlock, but being critical of the fact that the episode \"collapses into a muddled mess of melodrama and confusion ... there is even less logic.\" Romano considered the episode to be an anticlimax, saying \"the episode feels like a window dressing on a completely different story.\" Christopher Stevens for the \"Daily Mail\" ended up awarding the episode zero stars (following his one-star review of The Six Thatchers), highly critical of what was seen as poor writing, describing the \"problems\" of the episodes as \"all so callow, so contrived, so undergraduate\" and a proneness to become self-satisfied.\n\nIssues of representation within the episode were raised by some commentators. Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of The Daily Dot called the episode the \"most sexist\" of the TV show. She noted that Eurus, a stereotypical female villain, \"ticks every box for the kind of madwoman who gets locked up in an asylum in a 19th century melodrama\" and commits crimes only motivated \"by a desire for male attention.\"\n"}
{"id": "32211739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32211739", "title": "The Smurfs", "text": "The Smurfs\n\nThe Smurfs (; ) is a Belgian comic franchise centered on a fictional colony of small, blue, human-like creatures who live in mushroom-shaped houses in the forest. \"The Smurfs\" was first created and introduced as a series of comic characters by the Belgian comics artist Peyo (the pen name of Pierre Culliford) in 1958, wherein they were known as \"Les Schtroumpfs\". There are more than 100 Smurf characters, and their names are based on adjectives that emphasise their characteristics, such as \"Jokey Smurf\", who likes to play practical jokes on his fellow smurfs. \"Smurfette\" was the first female Smurf to be introduced in the series. The Smurfs wear Phrygian caps, which came to represent freedom during the modern era.\n\nThe word “smurf” is the original Dutch translation of the French \"schtroumpf\", which, according to Peyo, is a word he invented during a meal with fellow cartoonist André Franquin when he could not remember the word salt.\n\n\"The Smurfs\" franchise began as a comic and expanded into advertising, films, TV series, ice capades, video games, theme parks, and dolls.\n\nAt the time he came up with the idea for the Smurfs, Peyo was the creator, artist, and writer of the Franco-Belgian comics series titled \"Johan et Pirlouit\" (translated to English as \"Johan and Peewit\"), set in Europe during the Middle Ages and including elements of sword-and-sorcery. Johan serves as a brave young page to the king, and Pirlouit (pronounced Peer-loo-ee) functions as his faithful, if boastful and cheating, midget sidekick. \nIn 1958, \"Spirou\" magazine started to publish the \"Johan et Pirlouit\" story \"La Flûte à six trous\" (\"The Flute with Six Holes\"). The adventure involved them recovering a magic flute, which required some sorcery by the wizard Homnibus. In this manner, they met a tiny, blue-skinned humanoid in white clothing called a \"Schtroumpf\", followed by his numerous peers who looked just like him, with an elderly leader who wore red clothing and had a white beard. Their first full appearance was published in \"Spirou\" on October 23, 1958. The characters proved to be a huge success, and the first independent Smurf stories appeared in \"Spirou\" in 1959, together with the first merchandising. The Smurfs shared more adventures with Johan and Pirlouit, got their own series and all subsequent publications of the original story were retitled \"La Flûte à six Schtroumpfs\" (also the title of the movie version of the story).\n\nWith the commercial success of the Smurfs came the merchandising empire of Smurf miniatures, models, games, and toys. Entire collecting clubs have devoted themselves to collecting PVC Smurfs and Smurf merchandise.\n\n\"Schtroumpf\" is pronounced like the German word \"Strumpf\" meaning \"sock\". However, according to Peyo, the original author of the Smurfs comic strip, the term and the accompanying language of the Smurfs came during a meal he had with his colleague and friend André Franquin at the Belgian Coast. Having momentarily forgotten the word \"salt\", Peyo asked him (in French) to pass the \"schtroumpf\". Franquin jokingly replied, \"Here's the \"Schtroumpf\"—when you are done \"schtroumpfing\", \"schtroumpf\" it back...\" and the two spent the rest of that weekend speaking in \"\"schtroumpf\" language\". The name was later translated into Dutch as Smurf, which was adopted in English.\n\nBoth the comics and cartoons have been translated in many languages. In most cases, the original name \"Schtroumpf\" is replaced by a new term. The most common are variations on the Dutch translation \"Smurf\", while other names are indicative of their gnome-like appearance.\n\nIn Spanish, they are called \"Pitufos\", a term invented by Miguel Agustí who was the head of the Spanish magazine \"Strong\" which first published the cartoon in Spanish. According to Agustí, he was walking around Barcelona while trying to come up a name for the cartoon. He came across a sculpture of the Ox of Patufet and was inspired by the word Patufet. From Patufet he derived the non-existent word Pitufo. The name later spread to most Spanish-language versions of the cartoon.\n\nThe storylines tend to be simple tales of bold adventure. The cast has a simple structure as well: almost all the characters look essentially alike—mostly male (a few female Smurfs have appeared: Smurfette, Sassette, and Nanny Smurf), short (three apples high), with blue skin, white trousers with a hole for their short tails, white hat in the style of a Phrygian cap, and sometimes some additional accessory that identifies a personality (for example, \"Handy Smurf\" wears overalls instead of the standard trousers, a brimmed hat, and a pencil above his ear). Smurfs can walk and run, but often move by skipping on both feet. They love to eat sarsaparilla (a species of \"Smilax\") leaves, whose berries the Smurfs naturally call \"smurfberries\" (the smurfberries appear only in the cartoon; in the original comics, the Smurfs only eat the leaves from the sarsaparilla).\n\nThe Smurfs fulfill simple archetypes of everyday people: \"Lazy Smurf\", \"Grouchy Smurf\", \"Brainy Smurf\", and so on. All Smurfs, with the exception of Papa, Baby, Smurfette, Nanny and Grandpa, are said to be 100 years old. There were originally 99 Smurfs, but this number increased as new Smurf characters appeared, such as Sassette and Nanny. All of the original Smurfs were male; later female additions are Smurfette and Sassette—Smurfette being Gargamel's creation, while Sassette was created by the Smurflings.\n\nA characteristic of the Smurf language is the frequent use of the undefinable word \"smurf\" and its derivatives in a variety of meanings. The Smurfs frequently replace both nouns and verbs in everyday speech with the word \"smurf\": \"We're going \"smurfing\" on the River Smurf today.\" When used as a verb, the word \"Smurf\" typically means \"to make\", \"to be\", \"to like\", or \"to do\".\n\nHumans have found that replacing ordinary words with the term \"smurf\" at random is not enough: in one adventure, Peewit explains to some other humans that the statement \"I'm smurfing to the smurf\" means \"I'm going to the wood\", but a Smurf corrects him by saying that the proper statement would be \"I'm smurfing to the smurf\"; whereas what Peewit said was \"I'm warbling to the dawn\". So \"I'm smurfing to the smurf\" is not the same as \"I'm smurfing to the smurf\".\n\nIn the animated series, only some words (or a portion of the word) are replaced with the word \"smurf\". Context offers a reliable understanding of this speech pattern, but common vocabulary includes remarking that something is \"just smurfy\" or in some cases, \"smurftastic\".\n\nIn \"Schtroumpf vert et vert Schtroumpf\" (see \"Smurf Versus Smurf\"), published in Belgium in 1972, it was revealed that the smurf village was divided between North and South, and that the Smurfs on either side had different ideas as to how the term \"smurf\" should be used: for instance, the Northern Smurfs called a certain object a \"bottle smurfer\", while the Southern Smurfs called it a \"smurf opener\". This story is considered a parody on the still ongoing \"taalstrijd\" (language war) between French- and Dutch-speaking communities in Belgium.\n\nWhen they first appeared in 1958, the Smurfs lived in a part of the world called \"Le Pays Maudit\" (French for \"the Cursed Land\"). To reach it required magic or travelling through dense forests, deep marshes, a scorching desert and a high mountain range. The Smurfs themselves use storks in order to travel long distances, such as to the kingdom where Johan and Pirlouit live, and keep up-to-date with events in the outside world.\n\nIn the \"Johan et Pirlouit\" stories, the Smurf village is made up of mushroom-like houses of different shapes and sizes in a desolate and rocky land with just a few trees. However, in the Smurf series itself, the mushroom-like houses are more similar to one another and are located in a clearing in the middle of a deep forest with grass, a river, and vegetation. Humans such as Gargamel are shown to live nearby, though it is almost impossible for an outsider to find the Smurf village except when led by a Smurf.\n\nThe Smurfs' community generally takes the form of a cooperative, sharing, and kind environment based on the principle that each Smurf has something he or she is good at, and thus contributes it to Smurf society as he or she can. In return, each Smurf appears to be given their necessities of life, from housing and clothes to food without using any money in exchange.\n\nPapa Smurf is the leader of the community. Other Smurfs are generally named after their personality disposition, much like Disney's Seven Dwarfs; for example, Brainy, Greedy, Vanity, Lazy, Clumsy, Hefty, Jokey, Dreamy, Grouchy, or their profession, for example, Poet, Actor, Handy, Harmony, Farmer, Clockwork, Painter, Tailor, Miner, Architect, Reporter, Timber, Barber and Doctor Smurf. The first female Smurf, Smurfette, was created by Gargamel to lure the other Smurfs. Papa Smurf then changed her into what we see today. The non-Smurf characters who would appear later would include their enemies the wizard Gargamel, his cat Azrael, an ugly witch, Hogatha and Gargamel's godfather Balthazar; and their friends the page Johan and his young friend Peewit and the wizard Homnibus. There are 105 Smurfs.\n\nSince the first appearance of the Smurfs in \"Johan et Pirlouit\" in 1958, 31 Smurf comics volumes have been created, 16 of them by Peyo, the others by his studio. Originally, the Smurf stories appeared in \"Spirou\" magazine with reprints in many different magazines, but after Peyo left the publisher Dupuis, many comics were first published in dedicated Smurf magazines, which existed in French, Dutch, German and Turkish. A number of short stories and one page gags have been collected into comic books next to the regular series of 30 including a newly released Smurfs comics enitiled \"Les Schtroumpfs de L'ordre\" (\"The Order Law of the Smurfs\"). English translations have been published in the U.S. by the graphic novel publisher Papercutz as well as a mini series published by Marvel Comics in the mid-1980s.\n\nIn 1965, a black-and-white 87-minute animated film called \"Les Aventures des Schtroumpfs\" was released in theatres in Belgium. It consisted of five short cartoons made in the previous years for broadcasting on Walloon TV. German copies and copies with Dutch subtitles are known to exist. The stories were based on existing Smurf stories like \"The Black Smurfs\" and \"The Smurfs and the Egg\", and were created by writer Maurice Rosy and artist Eddy Ryssack from the small Dupuis animation studios. In total, ten animated shorts were created between 1961 and 1967, the first series in black and white and the later ones in colour.\n\nIn 1976, \"La Flûte à six schtroumpfs\" (an adaptation of the original \"Johan et Pirlouit\" story) was released. Michel Legrand provided the musical score to the film. The film would be released in the United States in 1983 (after the animated series became popular there) in an English language dubbed version titled \"The Smurfs and the Magic Flute\". A few more full-length Smurf films were made, most notably \"The Baby Smurf\" and \"Here are the Smurfs\", created from episodes of the Hanna-Barbera television cartoon series.\n\nSony Pictures has announced plans to begin a trilogy of live-action/computer-animated Smurf films, with the first film released on July 29, 2011. The project had been in various stages of development since 2003. In June 2008, it was announced that Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation had acquired film rights from Lafig Belgium. Jordan Kerner produced the film, with the screenwriters including \"Shrek 2\" and \"Shrek the Third\" screenwriters J. David Stem and David N. Weiss. The film stars Jonathan Winters as Papa Smurf, Katy Perry as Smurfette, George Lopez as Grouchy Smurf, Gary Basaraba as Hefty Smurf, John Oliver as Vanity Smurf, Alan Cumming as Gutsy Smurf, Paul Reubens as Jokey Smurf, Hank Azaria as Gargamel, Neil Patrick Harris as Patrick Winslow and Jayma Mays as Grace Winslow, a couple in New York who help the Smurfs get back to their village. It was suggested that Quentin Tarantino would play Brainy Smurf, but this \"didn't work out\" so Fred Armisen voices Brainy instead. A CGI/traditionally animated mini-film, titled \"\", was released on December 2, 2011, on \"The Smurfs\" DVD and Blu-ray. A sequel to \"The Smurfs\", titled \"The Smurfs 2\", was released on July 31, 2013. A fully animated \"Smurfs\" reboot film, \"\", was released in April 7, 2017, with Demi Lovato starring as Smurfette.\n\nThe Smurfs secured their place in North American pop culture in 1981, when the Saturday-morning cartoon series \"The Smurfs\", produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions in association with SEPP International S.A.R.L, aired on NBC from September 12, 1981 to December 2, 1989 (reruns until August 25, 1990). The show continued to air on the USA network until 1993, and on Cartoon Network until 2003. \"The Smurfs\" is still broadcast on the Boomerang channel throughout the United States. The show became a major success for NBC, spawning spin-off television specials on an almost yearly basis. \"The Smurfs\" was nominated multiple times for Daytime Emmy awards, and won Outstanding Children's Entertainment Series in 1982–1983. \"The Smurfs\" television show enjoyed continued success until 1990, when, after nearly a decade of success, NBC cancelled it due to decreasing ratings and plans to extend their \"Today\" morning show franchise to create a Saturday edition, although they did not do so until 1992 (two years later). The decreased ratings were the result of the network changing the format of the show, resulting in the final season featuring regular time travel with only a few Smurfs.\n\nIn the TV series, many classical masterpieces are used as background music during the episodes, among them Franz Schubert's Unfinished Symphony (Symphony No. 8 in B minor), Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt and Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. Reruns of the show are played on the Cartoon Network's sister channel Boomerang.\n\n\"The Smurfs\" was named the 97th best animated series by IGN. It was called \"kiddie cocaine\" for people growing up during the 1980s.\n\nOn August 31, 2017 it was announced that IMPS and Dupuis Audiovisuel would be working on the new Smurfs TV series with CGI animation.\n\nOn February 26, 2008, Warner Home Video released Season 1 Volume 1 on DVD, containing the first 19 episodes. On October 7, 2008, Warner Bros. released Season 1 Volume 2 on DVD, containing the remaining 20 episodes from season 1. Though Warner Bros. has decided to discontinue the season sets and release single-disc volume sets instead, they are reportedly still following the correct order of episodes.\n\nMagna Home Entertainment in Australia has released a 9-disc 50th Anniversary Collection, containing a total of 52 episodes. In September 2009, a Smurfette-themed collection containing 25 episodes was made available followed by the \"Papa Smurf Collection\" in December 2009 containing 26 themed episodes.\nIn July 2010, both the Smurfette and Papa Smurf Collection were included in a special 'Favourites Collection'. Also releasing at the same time was the Smurfs very first feature film (produced in 1975), \"The Smurfs and the Magic Flute\", available for the first time on DVD, in Australia.\n\nNovember 3, 2010 witnessed the release of two \"Just Smurfy\" collections, each featuring episodes not yet released on DVD to the Australian market. December 3, 2010 saw the 3rd collection hit the market. A fourth Just Smurfy set was planned for release on March 2, 2011.\n\nMagna Home Entertainment in Australia have released Season 1 & Season 2 on August 24, 2011. Season 3 and Season 4 released October 5, 2011. A limited edition 'Ultimate Collection 1' which features the first 5 seasons was released on August 24, 2011. A 'Ultimate Collection 2' which features Season 6 – Season 9 was released on November 2, 2011.\n\nThe show is being released on DVD in the UK through a joint conjunction with Arrow Films and Fabulous Films Ltd. The complete 1st season was released in a 4 Disc box set on July 5, 2010. Season 2 was released on September 6, 2010, Seasons 3, 4 and 5 was released on July 1, 2013 and the original Smurfs feature film, \"The Smurfs and The Magic Flute\", was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 11, 2010.\n\nPapa Smurf, Hefty Smurf, and Brainy Smurf appeared in the cartoon crossover \"Cartoon All Stars to the Rescue\" along with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck (from the Looney Tunes franchise), Huey, Dewey and Louie (from \"DuckTales\"), Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, Alvin and the Chipmunks, the Muppet Babies (Kermit, Piggy and Gonzo respectively), Slimer (from \"The Real Ghostbusters\"), \"ALF\", Michelangelo (from \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\"). Smurfette appeared on the promotional poster, but never appeared in the actual film.\n\nFrom 1959 until the end of the 1960s, Dupuis produced Smurf figurines. But the best known and most widely available Smurf figurines are those made by Schleich, a German toy company. Most of the Smurf figurines given away as promotional material (e.g. by National Garages in the 1970s and McDonald's in the 1990s) are also made by Schleich.\n\nNew Smurf figures continue to appear; in fact, only in two years since 1969 (1991 and 1998) have no new Smurfs entered the market. Schleich currently produces 8 to 12 new figurines a year. Over 300 million of them have been sold so far.\n\nOther Smurf figurines have been created for advertising purposes, e.g. worldwide for McDonald's and Kinder Surprise, or nationally for e.g. Albert Heijn in the Netherlands, and Delhaize in Belgium.\n\nSpecial Smurf comics were often created for advertising campaigns. This started in the 1960s for Kwatta and Kellogg's, and later for companies like BP in the UK and Australia, or Benco (a Dutch chocolate drink). These comics were often only part of a larger campaign, e.g. the Benco comics were accompanied by a TV ad.\n\nA Smurf balloon/float/Falloon (which is half float half balloon) continues to be presented in holiday parades such as Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\nSmurfs had two cereals in the 1980s made by Post Cereals: Smurf-Berry Crunch cereal and Smurfs Magic Berries. Both had animated commercials on Saturday morning. Two Smurfs pastas, made by Chef Boyardee and DelVerde were made in the 1980s, as well. Also Libby's & Heinz came out with Smurf-A-Getti canned pasta for the American and Canadian market.\n\nThe Smurfs had a commercial in the 1980s for the Mexican snack cake company Marinela Submarinos with a rare version of \"Smurfette (Pitufina)\" dressed in a red dress and her hair done in pigtails.\n\nOver the decades, many singles and albums of Smurf music have been released in different countries and languages, sometimes very successfully, with millions of copies sold. The best known is the single \"The Smurf Song\" and its accompanying album, created by Dutch musician Pierre Kartner who sings under the alias Father Abraham, which reached the #1 position in 16 countries. Worldwide, more than 10 million CDs with Smurf music have been sold between 2005 and 2007 alone.\n\nIn 1989, I.M.P.S and R-Tek Music, International created , released by Quality Special Products in Canada and The US and Dino Music in Australia. It was also released in parts of Europe. The Album came out on LP, CD and cassette. The LP featured 20 tracks (The Canadian CD and cassette had 16, the American CD had 10). The songs were covers of popular songs like Surfin' U.S.A., Kokomo, The Lion Sleeps Tonight and I Think We're Alone Now, as well as two original songs.\n\nFor several years, the Smurfs were the children's act in the Ice Capades travelling ice show. After they were retired from that function, the Smurf suits from the show were issued to Ice Capades Chalets, the show's subsidiary chain of ice rinks, lasting until the show was sold to a group of investors led by Dorothy Hamill. The Chalets were sold to Recreation World. The Smurfette suit in particular had a somewhat different hairstyle from what was portrayed in the Hanna-Barbera cartoons.\n\nIn 1984, the Smurfs began appearing in North American theme parks owned by Kings Entertainment Corporation. Each park featured a Smurf attraction and Smurf walk-around figures. Canada's Wonderland had an entire Smurf village to walk through, ending with Gargamel's Castle. \"The Smurfs' Enchanted Voyage\" was located in Kings Island. Kings Dominion has \"Smurf Mountain\". California's Great America featured a pint-sized steel coaster, \"The Blue Streak\". Carowinds had an artificial island that was named Smurf Island that had a Smurf village—including toadstool houses which could be entered. Hanna–Barbera Land had a Smurf district.\n\nIn 1989, in the France region of Lorraine, the Sorépark group opened a complete Smurfpark, named Big Bang Schtroumpf. In 1991, the park was bought by the successful Belgian Walibi Group and renamed Walibi Schtroumpf with new attractions. After the Walibi Group was acquired by Six Flags, the park was named Walibi Lorraine, and all the Smurfs references in the park were removed in 2003.\n\nComics Station, Motiongate Dubai, Movie Animation Park Studios and Dream Island feature Smurf sections.\n\nThe Smurfs have appeared in video games made for most major game consoles (including Nintendo's NES, Super NES, and Game Boy systems, Atari, , Sega's Game Gear, Master System, Mega Drive and Mega CD systems, and the original Sony PlayStation) and for the PC. In 2010, the Smurfs expanded into the world of apps for Android, the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch with the game \"Smurf Village\".\n\n\nIn 2005, an advertisement featuring the Smurfs was aired in Belgium in which the Smurf village is annihilated by warplanes. Designed as a UNICEF advertisement, and with the approval of the family of the Smurfs' late creator Peyo, the 25-second episode was shown on the national television after the 9 p.m. timeslot to avoid children having to see it. It was the keystone in a fund-raising campaign by UNICEF's Belgian arm to raise money for the rehabilitation of former child soldiers in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo—both former Belgian colonies.\n\nIn honour of their 50th anniversary in 2008, the Smurfs began a year-long \"Happy Smurfday Euro Tour\" in connection with UNICEF. The Smurfs visited fifteen European countries on the day of their 50th \"Smurfday\" in the form of publicly distributed white figurines. The recipients could decorate and submit them to a competition. The results of this contest were auctioned off and raised a total amount of 124,700 euros for benefit of UNICEF.\n\nThe 50th anniversary of the Smurfs and the 80th anniversary of the birth of its creator Peyo, were celebrated by issuing a high-value collectors' coin: the Belgian 5 euro 50th anniversary of The Smurfs commemorative coin, minted in 2008.\n\nIn 1998, writer Marc Schmidt wrote a parody article citing the Smurfs as an example of the impact of socialism in continental European culture. In 2011, Schmidt's essay was scrutinised in a response essay by Kate Krake, who examined the nature of cultural theory built on textual observation and warned against creating false allegories out of texts like The Smurfs.\n\nFrench sociologist Antoine Buéno described them in a 2011 book as a totalitarian and racist utopia. Studio Peyo head Thierry Culliford, the son of Peyo, dismissed Buéno's accusations as \"grotesque and frivolous\".\n\n"}

Although some versions describe Numa Pompilius, founder of the Roman civil religion, as a fourth impostor, the three \"impostors\" of the title were Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad. The existence of such a book, and the attribution of its authorship to various heretics and political enemies, was a running theme from the 11th to the 18th centuries, when hoaxes in Germany and France produced two physical books.\n\n\nAuthorship of such a book is also laid at the door of various Jewish and Muslim writers.\n\n\"De imposturis religionum\" was an anonymous attack, possibly Jewish or Muslim, on Christianity published in 1598, but dated earlier by G. Bartsch. It became known in the auctioning in 1716 of the library of the Greifswald theologian Johann Friedrich Mayer. To this text the Jurist Johannes Joachim Müller (1661–1733) wrote the two missing parts — against Moses and Muhammed — and the finished work appeared 1753 as \"De Tribus Impostoribus\".\n\nThe first printing of \"Traité sur les trois imposteurs\" was credited to the printer M. M. Rey, but may have existed in manuscript form for some time before it was published. The first trace we have of it as a manuscript comes from a letter to Prosper Marchand from his old friend, Fritsch. He reminds Marchand about how another friend, Charles Levier, got the manuscript of the treatise from the library of Benjamin Furly in 1711. This gives a clue as to the provenance of the manuscript, now all but confirmed, as the work of the Irish satirist and freethinker John Toland (Seán Ó Tuathaláin 1670–1722). Even if it is not by Toland, it is certainly from the early eighteenth century and traceable to Marchand's circle that included Jean Aymon and Jean Rousset de Missy and these may have edited Toland's hoax manuscript. It is unlikely to have been around since the time of Frederick II which was part of the mythology of the manuscript. According to historian Silvia Berti, the book was originally published as \"La Vie et L'Esprit de Spinosa\" (The Life and Spirit of Spinoza), containing both a biography of Benedict Spinoza and the anti-religious essay, and was later republished under the title \"Traité sur les trois imposteurs\". It is believed the author of the book may have been a young Dutch diplomat called Jan Vroesen.\n\nThe document purported to be a text handed down from generation to generation detailing how the three major figures of Biblical religion: Muhammad, Jesus and Moses were in fact misrepresenting what had happened to them. At the time, this novel approach was used to allow thinkers to conceptualize a world where explanation ruled over mere \"mystery\", a term used for the miraculous intervention on earth by God. It was useful to both Deists and atheists in legitimizing their world view and being a common source of intellectual reference.\n\nThe book was republished in Cleveland in 1904 by an anonymous publisher under the pseudonym \"Alcofribas Nasier the Later\" (using an anagram of François Rabelais, minus the cedilla on the c, which Rabelais used to publish \"Pantagruel\").\n\nIn 1770, the great Enlightenment satirist Voltaire published a response to the hoax treatise entitled \"Épître à l'Auteur du Livre des Trois Imposteurs\", which contains one of his best-known quotations, \"If God didn't exist, it would be necessary to invent Him.\" This was responded to a century later by Mikhail Bakunin, the anarchist political philosopher and activist, with \"If God did exist it would be necessary to abolish him\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2358061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2358061", "title": "Tristan and Iseult", "text": "Tristan and Iseult\n\nTristan and Iseult is an influential romance story, retold in numerous sources with as many variations since the 12th century. The story is a tragedy about the adulterous love between the Cornish knight Tristan (Tristram) and the Irish princess Iseult (Isolde, Yseult, etc.). The narrative predates and most likely influenced the Arthurian romance of Lancelot and Guinevere, and has had a substantial impact on Western art and literature since it first appeared in the 12th century. While the details of the story differ from one author to another, the overall plot structure remains much the same.\n\nThere are two main traditions of the Tristan legend. The early tradition comprised the French romances of two poets from the second half of the 12th century, Thomas of Britain and Béroul. Later traditions come from the Prose \"Tristan\" (c. 1240), which was markedly different from the earlier tales written by Thomas and Béroul. The Prose \"Tristan\" became the common medieval tale of Tristan and Iseult that would provide the background for the writings of Sir Thomas Malory, the English author who wrote \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" (c. 1469).\n\nThe story and character of Tristan vary from poet to poet. Even the spelling of his name varies a great deal, although \"Tristan\" is the most popular spelling. Most versions of the Tristan story follow the same general outline.\n\nAfter defeating the Irish knight Morholt, Tristan travels to Ireland to bring back the fair Iseult for his uncle, King Mark of Cornwall, to marry. Along the way, they ingest a love potion which causes the pair to fall madly in love. In the courtly version, the potion's effects last a lifetime, but, in the common versions, the potion's effects wane after three years. In some versions, they ingest the potion accidentally; in others, the potion's maker instructs Iseult to share it with Mark, but she deliberately gives it to Tristan instead. Although Iseult marries Mark, she and Tristan are forced by the potion to seek one another, as lovers. While the typical noble Arthurian character would be shamed by such an act, the love potion that controls them frees Tristan and Iseult from responsibility. The king's advisors repeatedly endeavour to have the pair tried for adultery, but the couple continually use trickery to preserve their façade of innocence. In Béroul's version, the love potion eventually wears off, and the two lovers are free to make their own choice as to whether to cease their adulterous relationship or to continue.\n\nAs with the Arthur-Lancelot-Guinevere love triangle, Tristan, King Mark, and Iseult of Ireland all love each other. Tristan honours, respects, and loves King Mark as his mentor and adopted father; Iseult is grateful that Mark is kind to her; and Mark loves Tristan as his son and Iseult as a wife. But every night, each has horrible dreams about the future. Tristan's uncle eventually learns of the affair and seeks to entrap his nephew and his bride. Also present is the endangerment of a fragile kingdom, the cessation of war between Ireland and Cornwall (Dumnonia). Mark acquires what seems proof of their guilt and resolves to punish them: Tristan by hanging and Iseult by burning at the stake, later lodging her in a leper colony. Tristan escapes on his way to the gallows. He makes a miraculous leap from a chapel and rescues Iseult. The lovers escape into the forest of Morrois and take shelter there until discovered by Mark. They make peace with Mark after Tristan's agreement to return Iseult of Ireland to Mark and leave the country. Tristan then travels to Brittany, where he marries (for her name and her beauty) Iseult of the White Hands, daughter of Hoel of Brittany and sister of Kahedin.\n\nIn the Prose \"Tristan\" and works derived from it, Tristan is mortally wounded by Mark, who treacherously strikes Tristan with a poisoned lance while the latter is playing a harp for Iseult. The poetic versions of the Tristan legend offer a very different account of the hero's death. According to Thomas' version, Tristan was wounded by a poison lance while attempting to rescue a young woman from six knights. Tristan sends his friend Kahedin to find Iseult of Ireland, the only person who can heal him. Tristan tells Kahedin to sail back with white sails if he is bringing Iseult, and black sails if he is not. Iseult agrees to return to Tristan with Kahedin, but Tristan's jealous wife, Iseult of the White Hands, lies to Tristan about the colour of the sails. Tristan dies of grief, thinking that Iseult has betrayed him, and Iseult dies swooning over his corpse. Several versions of the Prose \"Tristan\" include the traditional account of Tristan's death found in the poetic versions. \n\nIn French sources, such as those carefully picked over and then given in English by the well-sourced and best-selling Belloc translation of 1903, it is stated that a thick bramble briar grows out of Tristan's grave, growing so much that it forms a bower and roots itself into Iseult's grave. It goes on that King Mark tries to have the branches cut three separate times, and each time the branches grow back and intertwine. This behaviour of briars would have been very familiar to medieval people who worked on the land. Later tellings sweeten this aspect of the story, by having Tristan's grave grow a briar, but Iseult's grave grow a rose tree, which then intertwine with each other. Further tellings refine this aspect even more, with the two plants being said to have been hazel and honeysuckle.\n\nA few later stories even record that the lovers had a number of children. In some stories they produced a son and a daughter they named after themselves; these children survived their parents and had adventures of their own. In the romance \"Ysaie the Sad\", the eponymous hero is the son of Tristan and Iseult; he becomes involved with the fairy king Oberon and marries a girl named Martha, who bears him a son named Mark.\n\nThere are many theories present about the origins of Tristanian legend, but historians disagree over which is the most accurate. Some scholars suggest that the 11th-century Persian story \"Vis and Rāmin\" must have been the model for the Tristan legend because the similarities are too great to be coincidental. The evidence for the Persian origin of Tristan and Iseult is very circumstantial and different theories have been suggested how this Persian story might have reached the West, some suggesting story-telling exchanges during the crusades in Syrian court and through minstrels who had free access to both Crusader and Saracen camps in the Holy Land.\n\nThere is a \"Drustanus Stone\" in Cornwall with an inscription referring to \"Drustan\", but not all historians agree that the Drustan referred to is the archetype of Tristan. There are references to \"March ap Meichion\" (\"Mark\") and \"Trystan\" in the Welsh Triads, in some of the gnomic poetry, \"Mabinogion\" stories and in the 11th-century hagiography of Illtud.\n\nA character called Drystan appears as one of King Arthur's advisers at the end of \"The Dream of Rhonabwy\", an early 13th-century tale in the Welsh prose collection known as the \"Mabinogion\", and Iseult is listed along with other great men and women of Arthur's court in another, much earlier \"Mabinogion\" tale, \"Culhwch and Olwen\".\n\nPossible Irish antecedents to the Tristan legend have received much scholarly attention. An ill-fated \"triantán an ghrá\" or love triangle features into a number of Irish works, most notably in the text called \"Tóraigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne\" or \"The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne\". In the story, the aging Fionn mac Cumhaill takes the young princess, Gráinne, to be his wife. At the betrothal ceremony, however, she falls in love with Diarmuid, one of Fionn's most trusted warriors. Gráinne gives a sleeping potion to all present but him, eventually convincing him to elope with her. The fugitive lovers are then pursued all over Ireland by the Fianna. Another Irish analogue is \"Scéla Cano meic Gartnáin\", preserved in the 14th-century Yellow Book of Lecan. In this tale, Cano is an exiled Scottish king who accepts the hospitality of King Marcan of Ui Maile. His young wife, Credd, drugs all present, and then convinces Cano to be her lover. They try to keep a tryst while at Marcan's court, but are frustrated by courtiers. Eventually Credd kills herself and Cano dies of grief. In the Ulster Cycle there is the text \"Clann Uisnigh\" or \"Deirdre of the Sorrows\" in which Naoise mac Usnech falls for Deirdre, who was imprisoned by King Conchobar mac Nessa due to a prophecy that Ulster would plunge into civil war due to men fighting for her beauty. Conchobar had pledged to marry Deirdre himself in time to avert war, and takes his revenge on Clann Uisnigh. The death of Naoise and his kin leads many Ulstermen to defect to Connacht, including Conchobar's stepfather and trusted ally Fergus mac Róich, eventually precipitating the \"Táin Bó Cúailnge\".\n\nSome scholars believe Ovid's \"Pyramus and Thisbe\", as well as the story of Ariadne at Naxos might have also contributed to the development of the Tristan legend. The sequence in which Tristan and Iseult die and become interwoven trees also parallels Ovid's love story of Baucis and Philemon in which two lovers are transformed in death into two different trees sprouting from the same trunk. However this also occurs in the saga of Deidre of the Sorrows making the link more tenuous.\n\nIn its early stages, the tale was probably unrelated to contemporary Arthurian literature, but the earliest surviving versions already incorporated references to Arthur and his court. The connection between Tristan and Iseult and the Arthurian legend was expanded over time, and sometime shortly after the completion of the Vulgate Cycle (or the Lancelot-Grail) in the first quarter of the 13th century, two authors created the vast Prose \"Tristan\", which fully establishes Tristan as a Knight of the Round Table who even participates in the Quest for the Holy Grail.\n\nThe earliest representation of what scholars name the \"courtly\" version of the Tristan legend is in the work of Thomas of Britain, dating from 1173. Only ten fragments of his \"Tristan\" poem, representing six manuscripts, have ever been located: the manuscripts in Turin and Strassburg are now lost, leaving two in Oxford, one in Cambridge and one in Carlisle. In his text, Thomas names another \"trouvère\" who also sang of Tristan, though no manuscripts of this earlier version have been discovered. There is also a passage telling how Iseult wrote a short lai out of grief that sheds light on the development of an unrelated legend concerning the death of a prominent troubadour, as well as the composition of lais by noblewomen of the 12th century.\n\nThe next essential text for knowledge of the courtly branch of the Tristan legend is the abridged translation of Thomas made by Brother Robert at the request of King Haakon Haakonson of Norway in 1227. King Haakon had wanted to promote Angevin-Norman culture at his court, and so commissioned the translation of several French Arthurian works. The Nordic version presents a complete, direct narrative of the events in Thomas' Tristan, with the telling omission of his numerous interpretive diversions. It is the only complete representative of the courtly branch in its formative period. Preceding the work of Brother Robert chronologically is the \"Tristan and Isolt\" of Gottfried von Strassburg, written circa 1211–1215. The poem was Gottfried's only known work, and was left incomplete due to his death with the retelling reaching half-way through the main plot. The poem was later completed by authors such as Heinrich von Freiberg and Ulrich von Türheim, but with the \"common\" branch of the legend as the ideal source.\n\nThe earliest representation of the \"common branch\" is Béroul's \"Le Roman de Tristan\", the first part of which is generally dated between 1150 and 1170, and the latter part between 1181 and 1190. The branch is so named due to its representation of an earlier non-chivalric, non-courtly, tradition of story-telling, making it more reflective of the Dark Ages than of the refined High Middle Ages. In this respect, they are similar to Layamon's \"Brut\" and the \"Perlesvaus\". As with Thomas' works, knowledge of Béroul's is limited. There were a few substantial fragments of his works discovered in the 19th century, and the rest was reconstructed from later versions. The more substantial illustration of the common branch is the German version by Eilhart von Oberge. Eilhart's version was popular, but pales in comparison with the later Gottfried.\n\nThe French medievalist Joseph Bédier thought all the Tristan legends could be traced to a single original poem, adapted by Thomas of Brittany into French from an original Cornish or Breton source. He dubbed this hypothetical original the \"Ur-Tristan\", and wrote his still-popular \"Romance of Tristan and Iseult\" as an attempt to reconstruct what this might have been like. In all likelihood, Common Branch versions reflect an earlier form of the story; accordingly, Bédier relied heavily on Eilhart, Béroul and Gottfried von Strassburg, and incorporated material from other versions to make a cohesive whole. Some scholars still consider Bédier's argument convincing. A new English translation of Bédier's \"Roman de Tristan et Iseut\" (1900) by Edward J. Gallagher was published in 2013 by Hackett Publishing Company. A translation by Hilaire Belloc, first published in 1913, was republished in 2005.\n\nContemporary with Béroul and Thomas, the famous Marie de France presents a Tristan episode in one of her lais: \"Chevrefoil\". It concerns another of Tristan's clandestine returns to Cornwall in which the banished hero signals his presence to Iseult by means of an inscription on a branch of a hazelnut tree placed on the road she will travel. The title refers to the symbiosis of the honeysuckle and hazelnut tree which die when separated, as do Tristan and Iseult: \"Ni vous sans moi, ni moi sans vous.\" (\"Neither you without me, nor me without you.\") This episode is reminiscent of one in the courtly branch when Tristan uses wood shavings put in a stream as signals to meet in the garden of Mark's palace.\n\nThere are also two 12th-century \"Folies Tristan\", Old French poems identified as the Berne and the Oxford versions, which relate Tristan's return to Marc's court under the guise of a madman. Besides their own importance as episodic additions to the Tristan story and masterpieces of narrative structure, these relatively short poems significantly contributed to restoring the missing parts of Béroul's and Thomas' incomplete texts.\n\nThe great \"trouvère\" Chrétien de Troyes claims to have written a Tristan story, though no part of it has ever been found. He mentions this in the introduction to Cligès, a romance that many see as a kind of anti-Tristan with a happy ending. Some scholars speculate his Tristan was ill-received, prompting Chretien to write \"Cligès\" – a story with no Celtic antecedent – to make amends.\n\nAfter Béroul and Thomas, the most important development in French Tristaniana is a complex grouping of texts known broadly as the Prose \"Tristan\". Extremely popular in the 13th and 14th century, the narratives of these lengthy versions vary in detail from manuscript to manuscript. Modern editions run twelve volumes for the long version, which includes Tristan's participation in the Quest for the Holy Grail, or five volumes for a shorter version without the Grail Quest. It had a great influence on later medieval literature, and inspired parts of the Post-Vulgate Cycle, the \"Roman de Palamedes\", and Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\".\n\nThe earliest complete source of the Tristan material in English was \"Sir Tristrem\", a romance of some 3344 lines written circa 1300. It is preserved in the famous Auchinleck manuscript at the National Library of Scotland. The narrative largely follows the courtly tradition. As is true with many medieval English adaptations of French Arthuriana, the poem's artistic achievement can only be described as average, though some critics have tried to rehabilitate it, claiming it is a parody. Its first editor, Sir Walter Scott, provided a sixty line ending to the story, which has been printed with the romance in every subsequent edition.\n\nThe only other medieval handling of the Tristan legend in English is Sir Thomas Malory's \"The Book of Sir Tristram de Lyones\", a shortened \"translation\" of the French \"Prose Tristan\" in \"Le Morte d'Arthur\". Since the Winchester Manuscript surfaced in 1934, there has been much scholarly debate whether the Tristan narrative, like all the episodes in \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", was originally intended to be an independent piece or part of a larger work.\n\nThe popularity of Brother Robert's version spawned a unique parody, \"Saga Af Tristram ok Ísodd\", as well as the poem \"Tristrams kvæði\". In the collection of Old Norse prose-translations of Marie de France's lais – called \"Strengleikar\" (Stringed Instruments) – two lais with Arthurian content have been preserved, one of them being the \"Chevrefoil\", translated as \"Geitarlauf\".\n\nBy the 19th century, scholars had found Tristan legends spread across the Nordic world, from Denmark to the Faroe Islands. These stories, however, diverged greatly from their medieval precursors. In one Danish ballad, for instance, Tristan and Iseult are made brother and sister. Other unlikely innovations occur in two popular Danish chapbooks of the late 18th-century \"Tristans saga ok Inionu\" and \"En tragoedisk Historie om den ædle og tappre Tistrand\", in which Iseult is made the princess of India. The popularity of these chapbooks inspired Icelandic poets Sigurður Breiðfjörð and Níels Jónsson to write rímur, long verse narratives, inspired by the Tristan legend.\n\nA 158 line fragment of a Dutch version (ca. 1250) of Thomas of Britain's \"Tristan\" exists. It is being kept in Vienna, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Series nova 3968.\n\nA short Tristan narrative, perhaps related to the Béroul text, exists in six Welsh manuscripts dating from the late 16th to the mid 17th century.\n\nIn the first third of the 14th century, the famous Arcipreste de Hita wrote a version of the Tristan story. \"Carta enviada por Hiseo la Brunda a Tristán\". \"Respuesta de Tristán\" was a unique 15th-century romance written in the form of imaginary letters between the two lovers. Then there was a famous Spanish reworking of the French Prose Tristan, \"Libro del muy esforzado caballero Don Tristán de Leonís y de sus grandes hechos en armas\" first published in Valladolid in 1501, then republished in Seville in 1511, 1520, 1525, 1528, 1533 and 1534; additionally a second part, \"Tristan el Joven\", was created which dealt with Tristan's son, Tristan of Leonis.\n\nA 13th century verse romance exists in Czech, based on the German Tristan poems by Gottfried von Strassburg, Heinrich von Freiberg and Eilhart von Oberge. It is the only known \"verse\" representative of the Tristan story in a Slavic language.\n\nThe Tristan legend proved very popular in Italy; there were many \"cantari\", or oral poems performed in the public square, either about him, or frequently referencing him:\n\n\nThere are also four differing versions of the Prose Tristan in medieval Italy, most named after their place of composition or library in which they are currently to be found:\n\n\nThe Belarusian prose \"Povest o Tryshchane\" represents the furthest eastern advance of the legend, and, composed in the 1560s, is considered by some critics to be the last \"medieval\" Tristan or Arthurian text period.\n\nIts lineage goes back to the \"Tristano Veneto\". Venice, at that time, controlled large parts of the Serbo-Croatian language area, engendering a more active literary and cultural life there than in most of the Balkans during this period. The manuscript of the Povest states that it was translated from a (lost) Serbian intermediary. Scholars assume that the legend must have journeyed from Venice, through its Balkan colonies, finally reaching a last outpost in this Slavic language.\n\nThe Tristan story was very popular in several art media, from ivory mirror-cases to the 13th-century Sicilian Tristan Quilt. Many of the manuscripts with literary versions are illuminated with miniatures.\n\nIn English, the Tristan story suffered the same fate as the Matter of Britain generally. After being mostly ignored for about three centuries, there was a renaissance of original Arthurian literature, mostly narrative verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \n\nTristan material in this revival included Alfred Tennyson's \"The Last Tournament\", one of his \"Idylls of the King\"; Matthew Arnold's \"Tristram and Iseult\"; and Algernon Charles Swinburne's epic poem \"Tristram of Lyonesse\". Thomas Hardy's \"The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse\" is a one-act play which was published in 1923 (the book includes an imaginary drawing of the castle at the period). Rutland Boughton's opera \"The Queen of Cornwall\" (1924) was based on Thomas Hardy's play.\n\nAfter World War II, most Tristan texts were in the form of prose novels or short stories:\n\n\nIn 1832, Gaetano Donizetti references this story in \"L'elisir d'amore\" as the character of Adina sings the story to the ensemble, inspiring Nemorino to ask the charlatan Dulcamara for the magic elixir. Composed in 1859, \"Tristan und Isolde\" by Richard Wagner is now considered one of the most influential pieces of music of all time. In his work, Tristan is portrayed as a doomed romantic figure, while Isolde fulfils Wagner's quintessential feminine rôle as the redeeming woman. \n\nTwentieth-century composers also used the legend (often with Wagnerian overtones) in their compositions. Olivier Messiaen built his \"Turangalila Symphony\" around the story. Hans Werner Henze's \"Tristan\" borrowed freely from the Wagnerian version as well as retellings of the legend.\n\nThe story has also been adapted into film many times. \n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13584579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13584579", "title": "Züschen (megalithic tomb)", "text": "Züschen (megalithic tomb)\n\nThe Züschen tomb (, sometimes also \"Lohne-Züschen\") is a prehistoric burial monument, located between Lohne and Züschen, near Fritzlar, Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone cist (\"hessisch-westfälische Steinkiste\"), it is one of the most important megalithic monuments in Central Europe. Dating to the late 4th millennium BC (and possibly remaining in use until the early 3rd), it belongs to the Late Neolithic Wartberg culture. The presence of incised carvings, comparable to prehistoric rock art elsewhere in Europe, is a striking feature of Wartberg culture tombs, known so far only from Züschen and from tomb I at Warburg.\n\nThe tomb was accidentally discovered in 1894. For a number of years, a row of sandstone blocks had impeded the local miller from ploughing one of his fields. When he decided to remove them, Rudolf Gelpke, an inspector from nearby Garvensburg castle, noted the unusual presence of sandstone in the area of a basalt outcrop. On a visit to the site, he recognised it as a prehistoric monument consisting of two parallel rows of regularly shaped vertical slabs. Gelpke erroneously associated the monument with the Chatti, a local Iron Age tribe. He convinced the owner of the field to remove soil only from the ends of the row. This revealed bones and pottery sherds. At this point, Wilhelm von Garvens, owner of the Garvensburg, was notified. He, in turn, informed the antiquarian Baron Felix von und zu Gilsa. After Gilsa's scrutiny, the tomb was excavated, still in 1894, by Johannes Boehlau, former director of the State Museum at Kassel. Further excavations took place in 1939 and 1949, under the direction of O. Uenze of the archaeological service of Marburg.\n\nThe rectangular sunken chamber is 20m long and 3.5m wide. It is built of rectangular sandstone slabs, quarried several hundred meters away. Each long wall consists of a row of 12 slabs, one of which is missing. The narrow walls consist of a single slab each.\n\nA terminal slab separates the tomb chamber proper from a small anteroom of 2.5 m length. At the centre of this slab is a perfectly circular hole, the so-called \"Seelenloch\" (German for \"soul hole\"), of 50 cm diameter. This is sometimes assumed to be too narrow as an entrance for the passage of human bodies, in which case it may have served as a symbolic connection between the dead within the tomb chamber and the living, assembled in the ante-room for some ritual, perhaps an offering ceremony. Whether the hole could be closed, like in some comparable tombs in France, is not known. The floor of the anteroom was of densely trampled mud. The presence of non-local stones outside the chamber suggests that it was originally covered by an artificial tumulus. It is not clear whether the chamber was roofed in stone or some other material (wood).\n\nThe earth inside the chamber contained numerous disarticulated human bones. Although the minimum number of individuals is as low as 27, the broken and mixed state of the remains suggests severe disturbance. Thus, it is possible that the number of persons buried here was originally higher. The discovery of an Urnfield period burial above the original depositions indicates that the destruction of the grave, disturbance of its contents and removal of the roof must have taken place before the 10th/9th century BC. Charcoal and ashes were found in a number of locations, especially with human remains near the doorstone and near the southwest terminal slab. None of the human bones showed signs of burning. There was a continuous ash layer in the centre of the anteroom.\n\nMost finds appeared to be from the main chamber. They were probably placed there on the same occasions as the human bodies. The low number of finds may be the result of the early destruction of the tomb. More common finds included cattle bones and stone tools, including flint knives and sickle blades as well as locally typical triangular slate axes. There were at least three bone tools, namely a chisel, a point and an arrowhead. Pottery fragments were scant; they included a clay cup similar to examples from the related Lohra tomb and collared bottles connected with the northern Funnel Beaker (TRB) Culture. Such bottles appear to have served some special function, maybe the storage of vegetable oils or sulphur for healing purposes. A so-called \"Giant Urn\" belongs to the later burial.\n\nOne of the most striking features of the tomb is the presence of carved symbols on the slabs inside the chamber. Lines are formed of rows of individual punched dots, possibly applied with a very early metal tool. One of the more common symbols is a simple line with an attached open semicircle, usually interpreted as a stylised depiction of cattle. Normally, two of these symbols are linked by a further line with emphasised terminals. This may be a simple depiction of a plough. More rarely, two of them are linked by what resembles a yoke and pole, suggesting a cart. Occasionally overlapping signs suggest that the individual carvings are in no meaningful relationship to one another, but represent an accumulation of individual signs. Similar depiction of teams of cattle are known from much more recent (Bronze or Iron Age) carvings at Valcamonica near Capo di Ponte, Northern Italy and at Mont Bégo in the French part of the Ligurian Alps. The symbols are normally assumed to reflect Neolithic ideological or religious ideas.\n\nA reconstruction of the grave can be seen in the Hessian State Museum (\"Hessisches Landesmuseum\") in Kassel.\n\nLike any archaeological monument, the Züschen tomb should not be seen as isolated. It is in a close relationship with its landscape and with other sites in the area. Two further tombs, Züschen II and Züschen III are known to have existed in the area. Züschen II was 150 m northwest of the main tomb, it was generally comparable, but smaller and undecorated. A third tomb, Züschen III, is located further east. Less than 1 km from the Züschen tomb lies the Hasenberg, a prominent basalt dome, the top of which contains an important Wartberg settlement. Intriguingly, the Züschen tomb also appears to be designed in such a way that its main axis point directly at the Wartberg itself, 4 km to the east.\n\n\n\n"}
