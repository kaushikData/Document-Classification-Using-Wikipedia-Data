The film is a fictional representation of behind-the-scenes activities at the long-running public radio show of the same name. The film received mostly positive reviews and was a moderate box office success on its small budget.\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast including Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Tommy Lee Jones, Woody Harrelson, Lily Tomlin, Garrison Keillor, Virginia Madsen, John C. Reilly, and Lindsay Lohan.\n\nA long-running live radio show is in danger of being canceled by new owners of the company that holds both radio station \"WLT\" and the theater where the show is broadcast. The film takes place on the night of the show's last performance. The show has two visitors: an angel calling herself Asphodel (Virginia Madsen) comes to comfort the people who work on the show and to escort one of them to the afterlife, while \"the Axeman\" (Tommy Lee Jones), a representative of the new owners, arrives to judge whether the show should be canceled. He makes it clear that the show is not what he considers modern popular programming, and though he too is escorted by the angel, the show is shut down anyway. In an epilogue at the end of the film the former cast members are reunited at Mickey's Diner. Their conversation pauses as they are joined by Asphodel.\n\nTo receive insurance for the shoot, Robert Altman had to hire Paul Thomas Anderson as a \"backup\" director to observe filming at all times and be prepared to take over for Altman in case of his incapacity. Using the working title \"The Last Show\", principal photography for the film began on June 29, 2005, at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota (the usual venue for the radio show). Filming ended on July 28, 2005.\nBecause the Fitzgerald is a rather small building, other stage theaters in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region had been considered as stand-ins, but in the end, the necessary film equipment was crammed into the structure. The lack of space led to the basement also being used for some sets. Set design had to make the show more visually interesting, and fake dressing rooms were used in the film. The movie's production designer noted that Keillor's actual dressing room is \"about the size of a very, very small bathroom.\" \n\nMickey's Diner, a downtown St. Paul landmark, is also featured in the film.\n\nOn November 1, 2005, the \"Star Tribune\" reported that an early screening in New York City for film distributors resulted in a heavy bidding war. Picturehouse bought the rights, and company president Bob Berney, \"aiming to capitalize on the name recognition of the 31-year-old radio program, recommended that the title revert to \"A Prairie Home Companion\". 'At the screening, Garrison said that to broaden the film's appeal, they were thinking about changing the name to \"Savage Love\", so we may have an argument there,' Berney said.\"\n\n\"A Prairie Home Companion\" opened the 2006 South by Southwest film festival on March 10, then premiered in St. Paul, on May 3, 2006, at the Fitzgerald Theater, which had projection and sound equipment brought in for that purpose. The film's stars arrived in ten horse-drawn carriages. Brian Williams of \"NBC Nightly News\" anchored his newscast from neighboring Minneapolis, Minnesota, that night so that he would be able to attend.\n\nCritics' general reaction to the film was favorable, and it garnered an 82% fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars, saying, \"What a lovely film this is, so gentle and whimsical, so simple and profound\", and later added the film to his \"Great Movies\" list.\n\nMichael Medved (himself a radio host) gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying, \"The entertainment value stands somewhere between thin and nonexistent\" and \"[it may be] the worst movie ever made that pooled the talents of four (count ‚Äòem ‚Äì four!) Oscar winners\".\n\nDesson Thomson from \"The Washington Post\" fell in between, saying in a review headlined \"Honey, You Could Ask for More\" (a reference to the theme song of the radio show and film) that while the movie had its strengths, it was weaker than it should have been.\n\nMeryl Streep won the Best Supporting Actress Award from the National Society of Film Critics for her role; Altman was also posthumously nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Director.\n\nThe film had a successful limited release in the United States and grossed $20,338,609 domestically and $25,978,442 worldwide.\n\nNew Line released a soundtrack album featuring a mixture of old time music classics and contemporary songs written by Keillor.\n\nA Prairie Home Companion is the soundtrack the 2006 film \"A Prairie Home Companion\". It was released on May 23, 2006 via New Line Records.\n\nThe DVD was released on October 10, 2006. Special features included deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes documentary, and commentary by Altman and Kline. \"A Prairie Home Companion Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\" was released on May 23, 2006, by New Line.\n\n\n "}

It was discovered in 1961 in the Amman Citadel, and first published in full in 1968 by Siegfried Horn. The inscription is now in the Jordan Archaeological Museum. It is the third longest Semitic stone inscription ever found, after the Mesha Stele and the Siloam inscription.\n\nThe inscription is carved into a white limestone block of approximately 26 √ó 19 cm (10‚Ä≤ √ó 7¬Ω‚Ä≤) in size, with parts of the inscription lost. Most letters are clearly visible, and the stone has few traces of erosion and was therefore probably not exposed to the elements.\n\nThe inscription contains eight lines. The left and right sides of the inscription are missing parts, and the bottom line does not seem to include the end of the inscription. The top line is thought to be the beginning of the inscription since there is space above it.\n\nIn the eight lines, 93 letters are shown, which are interpreted to be spread between about 33 words. The size and shape of individual letters vary considerably, suggesting that the inscription comes from a novice scribe. Numerous letters have unusual shapes, for example the \"·∏•ƒìt\" has only two cross beams, compared to the usual three (ê§á), similar to the Mesha stele. The \"·π≠ƒìt\" is only a crossbar in a circle (instead of the usual ê§à), and the \" øayin\" is already slightly open upwards (ê°è instead of ê§è), which occurs in Phoenician inscriptions only from the 5th century.\n\nIt is understood to be a building inscription, although due to the fragmented nature of the inscription, the translation remains uncertain.\n\n\n"}

Philippe Vilain distinguishes autofiction from autobiographical novels in that autofiction requires a first-person narrative by a protagonist who has the same name as the author. Autofiction combines two mutually inconsistent narrative forms, namely autobiography and fiction. An author may decide to recount his/her life in the third person, to modify significant details or 'characters', using fiction in the service of a search for self. It has parallels with faction, a genre devised by Truman Capote to describe his novel \"In Cold Blood\". \n\nAutofiction is principally a genre associated with contemporary French authors, among them: Christine Angot, Marguerite Duras, Guillaume Dustan, Alice Ferney, Annie Ernaux, Herv√© Guibert, Am√©lie Nothomb, Olivia Rosenthal, Anne Wiazemsky, √âdouard Louis and Vassilis Alexakis. Catherine Millet's 2002 memoir \"The Sexual Life of Catherine M.\" famously used autofiction to explore the author's sexual experiences.\n\nIn India, autofiction has been associated with the works of Hainsia Olindi and postmodern Tamil writer Charu Nivedita. His novel Zero degree, a groundbreaking work in Tamil literature and his recent Novel \"Marginal Man\" are examples of this genre. Japanese author Hitomi Kanehara wrote a novel titled \"Autofiction\".\n\nIn Indian Urdu fiction novels of Rahman Abbas considered major work of autofiction.

{"id": "2210064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210064", "title": "Cognitive revolution", "text": "Cognitive revolution\n\nThe cognitive revolution was an intellectual movement that began in the 1950s as an interdisciplinary study of the mind and its processes, which became known collectively as cognitive science. The relevant areas of interchange were between the fields of psychology, anthropology, and linguistics using approaches developed within the then-nascent fields of artificial intelligence, computer science, and neuroscience. A key goal of early cognitive psychology was to apply the scientific method to the study of human cognition by designing experiments that used computational models of artificial intelligence to systematically test theories about human mental processes in a controlled laboratory setting.\n\nImportant publications that triggered the cognitive revolution include psychologist George Miller's 1956 article \"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two\" (one of the most frequently cited papers in psychology), linguist Noam Chomsky's rejection of the behaviorist approach in his 1959 review of B.F. Skinner's \"Verbal Behavior\" (1957), and foundational works in the field of artificial intelligence by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon, such as the 1958 article \"Elements of a Theory of Human Problem Solving\". Ulric Neisser's 1967 book \"Cognitive Psychology\" was also a landmark contribution.\n\nIn the 1960s, the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies and the Center for Human Information Processing at the University of California San Diego were influential in developing the academic study of cognitive science. By the early 1970s, the cognitive movement had surpassed behaviorism as a psychological paradigm, and by the early 1980s, the cognitive approach had become the dominant line of research inquiry across most branches in the field of psychology.\n\nIn his book \"The Blank Slate\" (2002), psychologist Steven Pinker identified five key ideas that made up the cognitive revolution:\n\nThe cognitive revolution in psychology took form as cognitive psychology, an approach in large part a response to behaviorism, the predominant school in scientific psychology at the time. Behaviorism was heavily influenced by Ivan Pavlov and E. L. Thorndike, and its most notable early practitioner was John B. Watson, who proposed that psychology could only become an objective science were it based on observable behavior in test subjects. Methodological behaviorists argued that because mental events are not publicly observable, psychologists should avoid description of mental processes or the mind in their theories. However, B. F. Skinner and other radical behaviorists objected to this approach, arguing that a science of psychology must include the study of internal events. As such, behaviorists at this time did not reject cognition (private behaviors), but simply argued against the concept of the mind being used as an explanatory fiction (rather than rejecting the concept of mind itself). Cognitive psychologists extended on this philosophy through the experimental investigation of mental states that allow scientists to produce theories that more reliably predict outcomes.\n\nThe traditional account of the \"cognitive revolution\", which posits a conflict between behaviorism and the study of mental events, was challenged by Jerome Bruner who characterized it as:\n\n...an all-out effort to establish meaning as the central concept of psychology [...]. It was not a revolution against behaviorism with the aim of transforming behaviorism into a better way of pursuing psychology by adding a little mentalism to it. [...] Its aim was to discover and to describe formally the meanings that human beings created out of their encounters with the world, and then to propose hypotheses about what meaning-making processes were implicated. (Bruner, 1990, Acts of Meaning, p. 2)\n\nIt should be noted however that behaviorism was to a large extent restricted to North America and the cognitive reactions were in large part a reimportation of European psychologies. George Mandler has described that evolutionary history.\n\nLachman, Lachman and Butterfield were among the first to imply that cognitive psychology has a revolutionary origin. After this, proponents of information processing theory and later cognitivists believed that the rise of cognitivism constitutes a paradigm shift. Despite the belief, many have stated both unwittingly and wittingly that cognitive psychology links to behaviorism.\n\nLeahey said that cognitive scientists believe in a revolution because it provides them with an origin myth which constitutes a beginning that will help in legitimizing their science. Others have said that cognitivism is behaviorism with a new language, slightly bent model and new concerns which aim at description, prediction and control of behavior. The change from behaviorism to cognitivism was gradual. Rather a slowly evolving science which took the origins of behaviorism and built on it. The evolution and building has not stopped, see Postcognitivism.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1745389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1745389", "title": "Cooperative principle", "text": "Cooperative principle\n\nIn social science generally and linguistics specifically, the cooperative principle describes how effective communication in conversation is achieved in common social situations, that is, how listeners and speakers must act cooperatively and mutually accept one another to be understood in a particular way. As phrased by Paul Grice, who introduced it, \"Make your contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged.\" Though phrased as a prescriptive command, the principle is intended as a description of how people normally behave in conversation. Jeffries and McIntyre describe Grice's maxims as \"encapsulating the assumptions that we prototypically hold when we engage in conversation\".\n\nThe cooperative principle can be divided into four maxims, called the Gricean maxims, describing specific rational principles observed by people who obey the cooperative principle; these principles enable effective communication. Grice proposed four conversational maxims that arise from the pragmatics of natural language. Applying the Gricean maxims is a way to explain the link between utterances and what is understood from them.\n\n\n\n\nWith respect to this maxim, Grice writes, \"Though the maxim itself is terse, its formulation conceals a number of problems that exercise me a good deal: questions about what different kinds and focuses of relevance there may be, how these shift in the course of a talk exchange, how to allow for the fact that subjects of conversations are legitimately changed, and so on. I find the treatment of such questions exceedingly difficult, and I hope to revert to them in later work.\"\n\n\n\nThese maxims may also be understood as describing the assumptions listeners normally make about the way speakers will talk, rather than prescriptions for how one ought to talk. Philosopher Kent Bach writes:\n\n...[W]e need first to get clear on the character of Grice's maxims. They are not sociological generalizations about speech, nor they are moral prescriptions or proscriptions on what to say or communicate. Although Grice presented them in the form of guidelines for how to communicate successfully, I think they are better construed as presumptions about utterances, presumptions that we as listeners rely on and as speakers exploit (Bach 2005).\n\nGricean maxims generate implicatures. If the overt, surface meaning of a sentence does not seem to be consistent with the Gricean maxims, and yet the circumstances lead us to think that the speaker is nonetheless obeying the cooperative principle, we tend to look for other meanings that could be implied by the sentence.\n\nGrice did not, however, assume that all people should constantly follow these maxims. Instead, he found it interesting when these were not respected, namely either \"flouted\" (with the listener being expected to be able to understand the message) or \"violated\" (with the listener being expected to not note this). Flouting would imply some other, hidden meaning. The importance was in what was \"not\" said. For example, answering \"It's raining\" to someone who has suggested playing a game of tennis only disrespects the maxim of relation on the surface; the reasoning behind this \"fragment\" sentence is normally clear to the interlocutor (the maxim is just \"flouted\").\n\nIt is possible to flout a maxim and thereby convey a different meaning than what is literally spoken. Many times in conversation, this flouting is manipulated by a speaker to produce a negative pragmatic effect, as with sarcasm or irony. One can flout the maxim of quality to tell a clumsy friend who has just taken a bad fall that her gracefulness is impressive and obviously intend to mean the complete opposite. Likewise, flouting the maxim of quantity may result in ironic understatement, the maxim of relevance in blame by irrelevant praise, and the maxim of manner in ironic ambiguity. The Gricean maxims are therefore often purposefully flouted by comedians and writers, who may hide the complete truth and manipulate their words for the effect of the story and the sake of the reader's experience.\n\nGrice's theory is often disputed by arguing that cooperative conversation, like most social behaviour, is culturally determined, and therefore the Gricean maxims and the cooperative principle cannot be universally applied due to intercultural differences. Keenan claims that the Malagasy, for example, follow a completely opposite cooperative principle in order to achieve conversational cooperation. In their culture, speakers are reluctant to share information and flout the maxim of quantity by evading direct questions and replying on incomplete answers because of the risk of losing face by committing oneself to the truth of the information, as well as the fact that having information is a form of prestige. However, Harnish points out that Grice only claims his maxims hold in conversations where his cooperative principle is in effect. The Malagasy speakers choose not to be cooperative, valuing the prestige of information ownership more highly. \n\nAnother criticism is that the Gricean maxims can easily be misinterpreted to be a guideline for etiquette, instructing speakers on how to be moral, polite conversationalists. However, the Gricean maxims, despite their wording, are only meant to describe the commonly accepted traits of successful cooperative communication. Geoffrey Leech introduced the politeness maxims: tact, generosity, approbation, modesty, agreement, and sympathy.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10615780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10615780", "title": "Dukun", "text": "Dukun\n\nA dukun is a Malay term for shaman. Their societal role is that of a traditional healer, spirit medium, custom and tradition experts and on occasion sorcerers and masters of black magic. In common usage the dukun is often confused with another type of shaman, the pawang. It is often mistranslated into English as \"witch doctor\" or \"medicine man\". Many self-styled dukun in Indonesia are simply scammers and criminals, preying on gullible and superstitious people who were raised to believe in the supernatural.\n\nThe dukun is the very epitome of the kejawen or kebatinan belief system indigenous to Java. Very strong and ancient beliefs of animism, ancestor worship and shamanism are held by the people of the Nusantara. While medical doctors and revivalist Islam and Christianity have caused a decrease in the prominence of dukun, they remain highly respected and somewhat feared figures in Indo-Malay society, even in the most orthodox Muslim-dominant areas. In the pre-colonial past, dukun were exempt from paying taxes, as with Hindu priests and Buddhist monks.\n\nMany highly prominent and highly educated Indonesians, Malaysians and Singaporeans, even those with Western doctorate and masters levels degrees will still consult dukun or soothsayers. Indonesians who are known to have employed dukun include former President Sukarno, former president Suharto, former president Megawati Sukarnoputri, Sultan Hamengkubuwana IX and Sultan Hamengkubuwana X and many more.\n\nDukun are most common on the island of Java, though the island of Madura is especially feared for being very powerful practitioners of dark magic, and Bali is well regarded for its dukun. The Dayak people of Kalimantan are also feared for their use of dukun when head-hunting. In Sabah, the Kadayan community are known for their dukun who are said to look waif-like with red eyes.\n\nIn common practice, a dukun is consulted when a person perceives they have an issue that has a supernatural or paranormal association. If a dukun is not known to the individual, their family or friends, word of mouth often creates a situation where the dukun will appear as if summoned, most especially in the case of possessions.\n\nThe dukun's knowledge is passed down orally, but the specific customs differ from one community to another. Initiates may voluntarily decide to learn the dukun's craft, or the position might be inherited. Proto-Malay dukun often serve the dual role of both shaman and village chief, known as a \"tok batin\". Dukun who inherited their knowledge from their parent or grandparent is held in higher esteem than one who served as another dukun's disciple. Typically the initiation ritual involves meditation at a mountain, waterfall, cemetery or some other location away from people. In some communities, such as the Kadayan of Sabah, dukun are also required to learn silat before they can be initiated. The purpose is both for the purpose of self-defence and for the spiritual training.\n\nDukun have a number of titles and ascribed abilities - the dukun roles below are sometimes taken up by dukuns with specific titles and roles, rather than any one dukun utilizing all of the roles below.\n\nThe dukun's primary role is that of a healer. They may use herbalism, incantations (\"jampi\"), chants (\"mantra\"), animal parts, inanimate objects, spiritual communication or guidance, prayers, offerings, the keris or any combination to effect their curatives.\n\nDukun are believed to be able to communicate directly with malevolent and benevolent spirits. Spirits are said not to resist the dukun in their removal from their 'host', as they are enthralled that a living being can communicate with them.\n\nDukun are most famous for prophetic visions. This is often the result of consulting spirits relating to one‚Äôs deceased family who often provide insight into what is likely to happen.\n\nDukun will occasionally bless an individual or a business, to keep away termites or spirits or demons, or over a piece of land to ensure a good harvest.\n\nDukun are alleged to see normally invisible spirits and communicate as easily as though the spirit were physically present. Many spirits are supposed to speak archaic Javanese or Sundanese and the Dukun may be able to speak these languages during momentary spiritual possessions, despite not having prior knowledge of these languages.\n\nDukun are generally benevolent shamans. On occasion, some practitioners may be employed to cast revenge hexes and incantations.\n\nSome known incantations include:\n\nJengges: Offerings such as incense and opium are arranged in a half-circle, as are nails, glass and needles. The dukun then asks the spirits to embed the items in the victim‚Äôs stomach.\n\nGendam : The dukun chants the victim's name so that the target cannot rest until they are cured by another dukun.\n\nNaruga: The dukun implants an emotional suggestion in the victim. It may be benevolent such as a love spell, or malevolent- causing the target to murder someone else.\n\nSantet: The dukun causes the target to have chronic diarrhea. \n\nSirep: The dukun causes people to fall under a deep, unshakable slumber.\n\nTenung: This ritual involves creating a half circle of food offerings, including opium and incense, while chanting for the destruction of the victim. The target suffers headaches, vomiting and illness until remedied by another dukun.\n\nSusuk: The dukun implants an enchanted metal needle into the patient's body. The dukun will use a spirit to implant the needle without leaving a wound. Originally a primitive form of skin-tightening, this procedure is supposed to make the patient more attractive. Mostly used by women, it could also be used for making a person less physically vulnerable\n\nMany dukun have been jailed for fraud and sexual assault in Indonesia. Sometimes, dukun have been killed in revenge attacks or by people thinking bad luck was caused by a dukun.\n\nThe 1998 East Java ninja scare was an outbreak of mass hysteria in East Java, Indonesia, in which the local population believed they were being targeted by sorcerers known as ninja, who were blamed for mysterious killings of religious leaders by assassins dressed in black. As many as 150-300 ‚Äúsorcerers‚Äù were killed between February and October, with the most deaths occurring between August and September.\n\n\n"}

If the Education Act of 1872 had been the solitary law added to the Statute\nbook during its continuance, that alone would be sufficient to make it memorable in the annals of Victoria. \nWhen we consider the difficulties which attend all attempts to deal with the much vexed question of public instruction, the prejudices which have to be overcome, and the sectarian enmity which has to be encountered, we may well be grateful that the Government measure passed through the ordeal it had to undergo in both Houses without the sacrifice of any of those vital principles it was and is intended to establish.\nFor the first time in this colony, the young will now have an opportunity of acquiring the rudiments of education unmixed with the leaven of sectarianism, and every child, no matter what its parents' circumstances may be, will receive at the hands of the state that key which, rightly used, unlocks whole stores of knowledge, from whose ample treasures the patient and industrious may freely help themselves. If due effect be given to the compulsory clauses, none will grow up in that gross ignorance which is such a fruitful mother of crime, which fills our gaols, and yearly robs honest industry of a large portion of its reward.\nOf course, a great deal will depend on the manner in which the new act is worked ; but if care be taken to administer it in the spirit which actuated its framers, we confidently expect to see the most beneficial effects flow from its operation.\"\n\n\n"}

The main feature of these figures is typically their papier mach√© head; bodies are covered in clothing matching the costume's theme.\n\nThe giants are usually hollow figures several meters tall, with a painted paper mach√© head and arms, the rest of the body being covered in cloth and other clothing. Their frame is usually made of wood or aluminum, with carton-pierre‚Äîa mixture of papier-m√¢ch√© and plaster of paris‚Äî used to make the head and hands. The frame of the body is hidden by cloth, and the arms typically have no structural element to allow them to swing in the air when the giant is turned.\n\nWithin the frame is an individual controlling the giant. He carries a harness on his shoulder that is linked to the internal structure, and will move and shake the giant in a dance, usually accompanied by a local marching band. Typically, these dances will include at least two giants, the male \"gigante\" and the female giantess, called \"giganta\" or \"gigantona\", though some towns have multiple couples.\n\nThe figures usually depict archetypes of the town, such as the bourgeois and the peasant woman, or historical figures of local relevance, such as a founding king and queen, or pairs of Moorish and Christian nobles.\n\"Cabezudos\" are smaller figures, usually to the human scale, that feature an oversized, carton-pierre head. The heads are worn with a matching costume. The person dressed as cabezudo will use one hand to hold his head, while the other hand carries a whip or pig bladder, used to frighten children or young women. Seeing through the \"mouth\" of the head, he will chase after these people, though he might pause to calm a frightened child.\n\nAs with the giants, the cabezudos typically represent archetypes of their town.\n\n\n\"Gigantes y cabezudos\" is also the title of an 1898 zarzuela, with music by Manuel Fern√°ndez Caballero, set in Saragossa and featuring a contemporary event: the Spanish army's return from the disastrous defeat of the Cuban War of Independence. The action unfolds during the festival of the Fiestas del Pilar, and concludes with a rousing jota focusing on the stereotypically strong, hardy character of the Aragonese, comparing them to the ever-battling \"Gigantes\" and \"Cabezudos\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13561", "title": "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau", "text": "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\n\n\"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" () is the national anthem of Wales. The title ‚Äì taken from the first words of the song ‚Äì means \"Old Land of My Fathers\" in Welsh, usually rendered in English as simply \"Land of My Fathers\". The words were written by Evan James and the tune composed by his son, James James, both residents of Pontypridd, Glamorgan, in January 1856. The earliest written copy survives and is part of the collections of the National Library of Wales.\n\"Glan Rhondda\" (Banks of the Rhondda), as it was known when it was composed, was first performed in the vestry of the original Capel Tabor, Maesteg (which later became a working men's club), in either January or February 1856, by Elizabeth John from Pontypridd, and it soon became popular in the locality.\n\nJames James, the composer, was a harpist who played his instrument in the public house which he ran, for the purpose of dancing. The song was originally intended to be performed in 6/8 time, but had to be slowed down to its present tempo when it began to be sung by large crowds.\n\nThe popularity of the song increased after the Llangollen festival of 1858. Thomas Llewelyn of Aberdare won a competition for an unpublished collection of Welsh airs with a collection that included \"Glan Rhondda\". The adjudicator of the competition, \"Owain Alaw\" (John Owen, 1821‚Äì83) asked for permission to include \"Glan Rhondda\" in his publication, \"Gems of Welsh melody\" (1860‚Äì64). This volume gave \"Glan Rhondda\" its more famous title, \"Hen wlad fy nhadau\", and was sold in large quantities and ensured the popularity of the anthem across the whole of Wales.\n\nAt the Bangor Eisteddfod of 1874 \"Hen Wlad fy Nhadau\" gained further popularity when it was sung by Robert Rees (\"Eos Morlais\"), one of the leading Welsh soloists of his day. It was increasingly sung at patriotic gatherings and gradually it developed into a national anthem.\n\n\"Hen wlad fy nhadau\" was also one of the first Welsh-language songs recorded when Madge Breese sang it on 11 March 1899, for the Gramophone Company, as part of the first recording in the Welsh language.\n\nIn 1905, \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" became the first national anthem to be sung at the start of a sporting event. Although crowds singing anthems during matches was commonplace, there was no precedent for the anthem to be sung before a game commenced in any sport. The Welsh national rugby team were playing host to the first touring New Zealand team, who to that point were unbeaten. After Wales won the Triple Crown in the 1905 Home Nations Championship the match was dubbed the 'Game of the Century' by the press. The New Zealand team started every match with the Haka, and Welsh Rugby Union administrator Tom Williams, suggested that Wales player Teddy Morgan lead the crowd in the singing of the anthem as a response. After Morgan began singing, the crowd joined in, and Wales became the first nation to sing a national anthem at the start of a sporting event.\n\nIn 1978 as part of their album, also called \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\", Geraint Jarman a'r Cynganeddwyr recorded a version of the Welsh national anthem using electric guitars, inspired by Jimi Hendrix's rendition of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\". Jarman's version, played by Welsh guitarist Tich Gwilym is one of the most famous modern versions of the song.\n\nTradition has established \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" as an unofficial Welsh anthem since 1905, when it was first sung by fans at rugby games, although the official anthem at the time was \"God Bless the Prince of Wales\". \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" slowly established itself as the more popular anthem over the next four decades, and was sung along with \"God Bless the Prince of Wales\" and \"God Save the Queen\" before sporting events until 1975, when sports officials decided that \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" should be sung alone. Like other British anthems, it has not been established as a national anthem by law, but it has been used as a national anthem at official governmental ceremonies, including the opening of the Welsh Assembly, and at receptions of the British monarchy since the 1970s. It is recognised and used as an anthem at both national and local events in Wales. \n\nUsually this will be the only anthem sung: only the first stanza and chorus are usually sung (and in the Welsh language). \"God Save the Queen\", the national anthem of the United Kingdom, is sometimes played alongside \"Hen Wlad fy Nhadau\" during official events with a royal connection.\n\nThe existence of a separate national anthem for Wales has not always been apparent to those from outside the country. In 1993 the newly appointed Secretary of State for Wales John Redwood was embarrassingly videotaped opening and closing his mouth during a communal singing of the national anthem, clearly ignorant of the words but unable to mime convincingly; the pictures were frequently cited as evidence of his unsuitability for the post. According to John Major's autobiography, the first thing Redwood's successor William Hague said, on being appointed, was that he had better find someone to teach him the words. He found Ffion Jenkins, and later married her.\n\nThe tune of \"Hen Wlad fy Nhadau\" has been used for the anthems of Cornwall (\"Bro Goth Agan Tasow\"), Brittany (\"Bro Gozh ma Zado√π\"), and Y Wladfa (\"Gwlad Newydd y Cymry\", see below).\n\n<poem>Mae hen wlad fy nhadau yn annwyl i mi,\nGwlad beirdd a chantorion, enwogion o fri;\nEi gwrol ryfelwyr, gwladgarwyr tra mad,\nDros ryddid collasant eu gwaed.\n\nHen Gymru fynyddig, paradwys y bardd,\nPob dyffryn, pob clogwyn, i'm golwg sydd hardd;\nTrwy deimlad gwladgarol, mor swynol yw si\nEi nentydd, afonydd, i fi.\n\nOs treisiodd y gelyn fy ngwlad tan ei droed,\nMae hen iaith y Cymry mor fyw ag erioed,\nNi luddiwyd yr awen gan erchyll law brad,\nNa thelyn berseiniol fy ngwlad.</poem>\n\n\"The following is a fairly free translation in verse.\"\n\n<poem>The land of my fathers is dear unto me, \nLand of poets and singers, and people of stature, \nIts warring defenders, so gallant and brave,\nFor freedom their life's blood they gave\n\nO land of the mountains, the bard's paradise,\nWhose precipice, valleys are fair to my eyes,\nGreen murmuring forest, far echoing flood\nFire the fancy and quicken the blood\n\nFor tho' the fierce foeman has ravaged your realm,\nThe old speech of Wales he cannot o'erwhelm,\nOur passionate poets to silence command,\nNor banish the harp from your strand.</poem>\n\"A more literal translation is:\"\n\nThe old land of my fathers is dear to me,<br>\nLand of bards and singers, famous men of renown;<br>\nHer brave warriors, very splendid patriots,<br>\nFor freedom shed their blood.\n\nOld mountainous Wales, paradise of the bard,<br>\nEvery valley, every cliff, to my look is beautiful.<br>\nThrough patriotic feeling, so charming is the murmur<br>\nOf her brooks, rivers, to me.\n\nIf the enemy oppresses my land under his foot, <br>\nThe old language of the Welsh is as alive as ever.<br>\nThe muse is not hindered by the hideous hand of treason,<br>\nNor [is] the melodious harp of my country.\n\n\"Other translations include:\"\n\nThe land of my fathers is dear to me,<br>\nOld land where the minstrels are honoured and free;<br>\nIts warring defenders so gallant and brave,<br>\nFor freedom their life's blood they gave.\n\nOld land of the mountains, the Eden of bards,<br>\nEach gorge and each valley a loveliness guards;<br>\nThrough love of my country, charmed voices will be <br>\nIts streams, and its rivers, to me.\n\nThough foemen have trampled my land 'neath their feet, <br>\nThe language of Cambria still knows no retreat;<br>\nThe muse is not vanquished by traitor's fell hand,<br>\nNor silenced the harp of my land.\n\nThe Welsh poet Dylan Thomas is often quoted as saying \"The land of my fathers. My fathers can have it!\" in reference to Wales. However, this is misleading, as it was a villainous character in one of Thomas' short stories that spoke this line.\n\nGwynfor Evans named his history of Wales \"Land of my fathers: 2,000 years of Welsh history\". It was a translation of the Welsh original, \"Aros Mae\".\n\nThe ¬£1 coins minted in 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000 with a Welsh emblem on the reverse, also bear the edge inscription (\"I am devoted to my country\"), from the refrain of \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\". The new Royal Badge of Wales adopted in 2008 features this motto.\n\nA version of \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" was written by Lewis Evans, a migrant from Wales to Y Wladfa, a Welsh-speaking settlement in Patagonia, South America. The version penned by Evans is called \"Gwlad Newydd y Cymry\" (The New Country of the Welsh). \"Gwlad Newydd y Cymry\" is played to the same tune as \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\".\n\nThe lyrics to \"Gwlad Newydd y Cymry\" are as follows;\n\n<poem>Y mae Patagonia yn annwyl i mi,\nGwlad newydd y Cymry mwyneiddlon yw hi;\nAnadlu gwir ryddid a gawn yn y wlad,\nO gyrhaedd gormesiaeth a brad:\n\nBu'r Cymry yn gorwedd dan ddirmyg yn drwch,\nWel, diolch am Wladfa i'n codi o'r llwch;\nEin heniaith a gadwn mewn urddas a bri,\nTra'r Gamwy'n ddysgleiriol ei lli:\n\n'Chaiff Cymro byth mwyach ymostwng i Sais,-\nTerfynodd ei orthrwm - dystawyd ei lais;\nY Wladfa fawrygwn tra'r Andes wen fawr,\nA'i choryn yn 'stafell y wawr:\n\nLearn to read, pronounce, sing perform Welsh National Anthem; New App published by the National Library of Wales published. https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/908469898\n\n"}

{"id": "20192650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20192650", "title": "Hygge", "text": "Hygge\n\nHygge ( or ) is a Danish and Norwegian word for a mood of coziness and comfortable conviviality with feelings of wellness and contentment. As a cultural category with its sets of associated practices \"hygge\" has more or less the same meanings in Danish and Norwegian, but the notion is more central in Denmark than Norway. The emphasis on \"hygge\" as a part of Danish culture is a recent phenomenon, dating to the late 20th century.\n\nThe word \"hygge\" comes from a Danish word meaning \"to give courage, comfort, joy\". \"Hygge\" stems from \"hyggja\" which means to think in Old Norse. \"Hygge\" is built from the Old Norse word \"hugr\" which later became the \"hug\" which means the soul, mind, consciousness. In Swedish Hygge is a harvested forest area.\n\nBut it is also speculated that \"hygge\" might originate from the word \"hug\". \"Hug\" comes from the 1560s word \"hugge\", which means \"to embrace\". The word \"hugge\" is of unknown origin but is highly associated with an Old Norse term, \"hygga\", which means \"to comfort\", which comes from the word \"hugr\", meaning \"mood\". In turn, the word comes from the Germanic word \"hugyan\", which relates to the Old English \"hycgan\", meaning \"to think, consider\".\n\nIt first appeared in Danish writing in the 19th Century and has since evolved into the cultural idea known in Denmark and Norway today. While hygge has exactly the same meaning in Norwegian as in Danish and is a widely used word in Denmark (including in its derived forms, such as \"hyggelig\"), the emphasis specifically on \"hygge\" as an important part of their cultural identity is mostly a recent Danish phenomenon; in Norway \"hygge\" is just a word, similar in status to \"cozy\" in English-speaking countries.\n\nIn both Danish and Norwegian, \"hygge\" refers to \"a form of everyday togetherness\", \"a pleasant and highly valued everyday experience of safety, equality, personal wholeness and a spontaneous social flow\".\n\nThe noun \"hygge\" includes something nice, cozy, safe and known, referring to a psychological state.\n\n\"Collins\" \"English Dictionary\" defines the word as \"a concept, originating in Denmark, of creating cosy and convivial atmospheres that promote wellbeing\".\n\n\"Collins English Dictionary\" named \"hygge\" the runner-up (after \"Brexit\") as word of the year in the UK in 2016. This followed a period during which several books focusing on \"hygge\" had been marketed in the UK, such as \"The Little Book of Hygge\" by Meik Wiking, \"Hygge: The Danish Art of Happiness\" by Marie Tourell S√∏derberg, and \"The Book of Hygge: The Danish Art of Living Well\" by Louisa Thomsen Brits.\n\nIn the Broadway musical Frozen, there is a song called ‚ÄòHygge‚Äô, which is all about being comfortable.\n\nIn Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\", Jemima Davies-Smythe incorporates Hygge into a resdesign of her half-brother Karl Kennedy's living room.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45492", "title": "I Am Legend (novel)", "text": "I Am Legend (novel)\n\nI Am Legend is a 1954 science fiction horror novel by American writer Richard Matheson. It was influential in the development of the zombie-vampire genre and in popularizing the concept of a worldwide apocalypse due to disease. The novel was a success and was adapted into the films \"The Last Man on Earth\" (1964), \"The Omega Man\" (1971), \"I Am Legend\" (2007), and the direct-to-video production \"I Am Omega\" (2007). It was also an inspiration behind \"Night of the Living Dead\" (1968).\n\nRobert Neville is the apparent sole survivor of a pandemic whose symptoms resemble vampirism. It is said that the pandemic was caused by a war, and that it was spread by dust storms in the cities and an explosion in the mosquito population. The narrative details Neville's daily life in Los Angeles as he attempts to comprehend, research, and possibly cure the disease, to which he is immune. Neville's past is revealed through flashbacks; the disease claimed his wife and daughter, and he was forced to kill his wife after she seemingly rose from the dead as a vampire and attacked him. Before he killed her, Neville says he did try to keep her with him but gives no details about this.\n\nNeville survives by barricading himself inside his house after sunset, and he is further protected by garlic, mirrors, and crucifixes. Swarms of vampires, led by Neville's neighbor, Ben Cortman, regularly surround his house, trying to find ways to get inside. During the day, he scavenges for supplies and searches out the inactive vampires, driving stakes into their hearts to kill them. He finds brief solace in a stray dog that finds its way to his house. Desperate for company, Neville slowly earns the dog's trust with food and brings it into the house. Despite his efforts, the dog proves to be infected and dies a week later.\n\nAfter bouts of depression and alcoholism, Neville decides to find out the scientific cause of the pandemic. He obtains books and other research materials from a library, and through painstaking research discovers the root of the disease in a strain of bacteria capable of infecting both deceased and living hosts. His experiments also reveals that the infection creates an allergic reaction to garlic in the host. He further discovers that the vampires are affected by mirrors and crosses because of \"hysterical blindness\", the result of previous psychological conditioning of the infected. Driven insane by the disease, the infected now react as they believe they should when confronted with these items. Even then, their reaction is constrained to the beliefs of the particular person; for example, a Christian vampire would fear the cross, but a Jewish vampire would not.\n\nNeville also discovers more efficient means of killing the vampires, other than just driving a stake into their hearts. This includes exposing them to direct sunlight (which kills the bacteria) or inflicting deep wounds on their bodies so that the bacteria switch from being anaerobic symbionts to aerobic parasites, rapidly consuming their hosts when exposed to air. He is now killing such large numbers of vampires in his daily forays that his nightly visitors have diminished significantly.\n\nAfter three years, Neville sees an apparently uninfected woman, Ruth, in broad daylight, and captures her. After some convincing, Ruth tells him her story of how she and her husband survived the pandemic (though her husband was killed two weeks earlier). Neville is puzzled by the fact that she is upset when he speaks of killing vampires; he thinks that if her story of survival was true, she would have become hardened to the act. He attempts to test whether she is a vampire by exposing her to garlic, which causes her to recoil violently. At night Neville is startled awake and finds Ruth fully clothed at the front door of the house. Suspicious, he questions her motives, but relates the trauma of his past, whereupon they comfort each other. Ruth reluctantly allows him to take a blood sample but knocks him unconscious when the sample reveals that she is infected.\n\nWhen he wakes, Neville discovers a note from Ruth confessing that she is actually infected and that Neville was responsible for her husband's death. Ruth admits that she was sent to spy on him. It turns out that only the infected created from reanimated corpses are utterly feral, but not those who were alive when they were infected. The living-infected have slowly overcome their disease until they can spend short periods of time in sunlight, and are attempting to build a new society. They have developed medication which helps them to overcome the most severe symptoms of the infection. Ruth warns Neville that her people will attempt to capture him, and that he should leave his house and escape to the mountains.\n\nNeville cannot bring himself to leave his house, however, and assumes that he will be captured and treated fairly by the new society. Infected members of the new society eventually attack the house. During the attack, the members of the new society violently dispatch the feral vampires outside the house, and Neville becomes alarmed at the grim enjoyment they appear to take from this task. Realising that the intention of the attackers may be to kill him rather than to capture him, he tries to defend himself with a pistol, leading to one of the infected shooting and badly injuring him.\n\nNeville wakes in a barred cell where he is visited by Ruth, who informs him that she is a ranking member of the new society but, unlike the others, does not resent him. Ruth attempts to present a fa√ßade of indifference to Neville, but is unable to maintain it during her discussion with him. After discussing the effects of Neville's vampire-killing activities on the new society, she acknowledges the need for Neville's execution and gives him pills, claiming they will \"make it easier\". Fatally injured, Neville accepts his fate and asks Ruth not to let this society become heartless. Ruth kisses him and leaves.\n\nNeville goes to his prison window and sees the infected waiting for his execution. He now sees that the infected view him with the same hatred and fear that he once felt for the vampires; he realizes that he, a remnant of old humanity, is now a legend to the new race born of the infection: Just as vampires are monsters that hunt humans during the time of day they are not active (night), he is a feared monster that hunts the vampires during the daylight hours when they are asleep. He recognizes that their desire to kill him is not something he can condemn. As the pills take effect, he thinks: \"[I am] a new superstition entering the unassailable fortress of forever. I am legend.\"\n\nAs related from \"In Search of Wonder\" (1956), Damon Knight wrote:\nThe book is full of good ideas, every other one of which is immediately dropped and kicked out of sight. The characters are child's drawings, as blank-eyed and expressionless as the author himself in his back-cover photograph. The plot limps. All the same, the story could have been an admirable minor work in the tradition of \"Dracula\", if only the author, or somebody, had not insisted on encumbering it with the year's most childish set of 'scientific' rationalizations.\n\n\"Galaxy\" reviewer Groff Conklin described \"Legend\" as \"a weird [and] rather slow-moving first novel¬†... a horrid, violent, sometimes exciting but too often overdone tour de force.\" Anthony Boucher praised the novel, saying \"Matheson has added a new variant on the Last Man theme¬†... and has given striking vigor to his invention by a forceful style of storytelling which derives from the best hard-boiled crime novels\".\n\nDan Schneider from \"International Writers Magazine: Book Review\" wrote in 2005:\n...¬†despite having vampires in it, [the novel] is not a novel on vampires, nor even a horror nor sci-fi novel at all, in the deepest sense. Instead, it is perhaps the greatest novel written on human loneliness. It far surpasses Daniel Defoe‚Äôs \"Robinson Crusoe\" in that regard. Its insights into what it is to be human go far beyond genre, and is all the more surprising because, having read his short stories--which range from competent but simplistic, to having classic \"Twilight Zone\" twists (he was a major contributor to the original TV series)--there is nothing within those short stories that suggests the supreme majesty of the existential masterpiece \"I Am Legend\" was aborning.\n\nIn 2012, the Horror Writers Association gave \"I Am Legend\" the special Vampire Novel of the Century Award.\n\nAlthough Matheson calls the assailants in his novel \"vampires\", and though their condition is transmitted through blood and garlic is an apotropaic-like repellant, there is little similarity between them and vampires as developed by John William Polidori and his successors, who come straight out of the gothic fiction tradition. In \"I Am Legend\", the \"vampires\" share more similarities with zombies, and the novel influenced the zombie genre and popularized the concept of a worldwide zombie apocalypse. Although the idea has now become commonplace, a scientific origin for vampirism or zombies was fairly original when written. According to Clasen:\nThough referred to as \"the first modern vampire novel\", it is as a novel of social theme that \"I Am Legend\" made a lasting impression on the cinematic zombie genre, by way of director George A. Romero, who acknowledged its influence and that of its 1964 adaptation, \"The Last Man on Earth\", upon his seminal film \"Night of the Living Dead\" (1968). Discussing the creation of \"Night of the Living Dead\", Romero remarked, \"I had written a short story, which I basically had ripped off from a Richard Matheson novel called \"I Am Legend\".\" Moreover, film critics noted similarities between \"Night of the Living Dead\" (1968) and \"The Last Man on Earth\" (1964).\n\nStephen King said, \"Books like \"I Am Legend\" were an inspiration to me\". Film critics noted that the British film \"28 Days Later\" (2002) and its sequel \"28 Weeks Later\" both feature a rabies-type plague ravaging Great Britain, analogous to \"I Am Legend\".\n\nTim Cain, the producer, lead programmer and one of the main designers of the 1997 computer game \"Fallout,\" said: This book was how a [sic] individual would handle thinking that he was the last survivor on Earth. This is why in \"Fallout 1\" when you're voted to leave the Vault, we really wanted that sense of isolationism; that sense of: You are the only person out here on the Wasteland who is, quote, \"a normal person\", and we wanted you to feel, like, special in that way.\n\nThe book has also been adapted into a comic book miniseries titled \"Richard Matheson's I Am Legend\" by Steve Niles and Elman Brown. It was published in 1991 by Eclipse Comics and collected into a trade paperback by IDW Publishing.\n\nAn unrelated film tie-in was released in 2007 as a one-shot \"I Am Legend: Awakening\" published in a San Diego Comic-Con special by Vertigo.\n\nA nine-part abridged reading of the novel performed by Angus MacInnes was originally broadcast on BBC Radio 7 in January 2006 and repeated in January 2018.\n\n\"I Am Legend\" has been adapted to a feature-length film four times (one of which does not credit Matheson as the source). Differing from the book, each of them portrays the Neville character as an accomplished scientist. The first three adaptations show him finding a remedy and passing it on. Adaptations differ from the novel by setting the events three years after the disaster, instead of happening ‚Äúin the span of‚Äù three years. Also adaptations are set in the near future, a few years after the film's release, while the novel is set twenty years after its publication date.\n\nIn 1964, Vincent Price starred as Dr. Robert Morgan (rather than \"Neville\") in \"The Last Man on Earth\" (the original title of this Italian production was \"L'ultimo uomo della Terra\"). Matheson wrote the original screenplay for this adaptation, but due to later rewrites did not wish his name to appear in the credits; as a result, Matheson is credited under the pseudonym \"Logan Swanson\".\n\nIn 1971, a far different version was produced, titled \"The Omega Man\". It starred Charlton Heston (as Robert Neville) and Anthony Zerbe. Matheson had no influence on the screenplay for this film, and although the premise remains, it deviates from the novel in several ways, removing the infected people's vampiric characteristics, except their sensitivity to light. In this version, the infected are portrayed as nocturnal, black-robed, albino mutants, known as The Family. Though intelligent, they eschew modern technology, believing it (and those who use it, such as Neville) to be evil and the cause of humanity's downfall.\n\nIn 2007, a third adaptation of the novel was produced, this time titled \"I Am Legend\". Directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Will Smith as Robert Neville, this film uses both Matheson's novel and the 1971 \"Omega Man\" film as its sources. This adaptation also deviates significantly from the novel. In this version, the infection is caused by a virus originally intended to cure cancer. Some vampiric elements are retained, such as sensitivity to UV light and attraction to blood. The infected are portrayed as nocturnal, feral creatures of limited intelligence who hunt the uninfected with berserker-like rage. Other creatures, such as dogs, are also infected by the virus. The ending of the film was also altered to portray Neville as sacrificing his life to save humanity, rather than being executed for crimes against the surviving vampiric humans, although a deleted ending for the film was closer in spirit to the book. The film takes place in New York City in the years 2009 and 2012 rather than Los Angeles in 1975‚Äì1977.\n\nThe Asylum production \"I Am Omega\" is a 2007 American feature length direct-to-video release starring Mark Dacascos. The film takes place in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, which is overrun by savage, cannibalistic humans who have degenerated into a feral subspecies as the result of a genetic virus. Once again, the adaption deviates from the novel and does not credit Matheson.\n\nIn this adaption, \"Renchard\" has been forced to live in a daily struggle for survival against the mutants. Renchard is contacted via webcam by Brianna (Jennifer Lee Wiggins), another survivor who was stranded in Los Angeles while trying to find Antioch, a community of survivors.

In response, Toronto lawyer Robin Parker launched a crowdfunding campaign to create a new prize for First Nations, M√©tis and Inuit writers in Canada. The crowdfunding campaign was set with a goal of $10,000, but ultimately attracted over $140,000 in donations.\n\nThe awards honour both published and unpublished work by indigenous writers. The first winners were announced in May 2018.\n\n"}

It was established in 1964 and its headquarters are in Yotsuya, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo. The JNTO operates Tourist Information Centers (TICs) as well as a website. It disseminates information about transportation, lodging, food and beverage, and sight-seeing as well as published tourism statistics and market reports. It also provides support for international conventions and incentive events. \n\nJNTO is an Independent Administrative Institution of the government of Japan. Its publications and website assist in preparing travel itineraries within Japan, providing a wide range of travel information in English and other languages on transportation, accommodations, shopping and events. The materials are updated frequently.\n\nWhile traveling in Japan, visitors may take advantage of the nationwide \"i\" Information System, which numbered 113 outlets in 2004. Each \"i\" center is an information source for the area it represents. The \"i\" centers are ordinarily located at railway stations or in city centers, and are easily recognized by their logo, a red question mark with the word \"information\" printed underneath.\n\nJNTO sponsors a Goodwill Guide Program, through which some 47,000 bilingual volunteers assist visitors from abroad. They earn the right to wear the program's identifying badge, a white pigeon superimposed upon a globe. Throughout Japan, there are 77 Systematized Goodwill Guide groups (SGG) consisting mostly of students, housewives and retirees who engage in a variety of activities using their foreign language skills. Some groups offer a free preset walking tour, for which the visitor only needs to go to a pre-established place at a certain date and time, while others are available to meet tourists on request. There is no charge for the service of the Goodwill Guides, as they are volunteers, only their travel expenses and their admissions to tourist facilities, and for shared meals.\n\nServices of professional guides and interpreters may be retained through the \"Japan Guide Association\" or the \"Japan Federation of Licensed Guides\". JNTO administers Licensed Guide Interpreter Examination. A total of some 1,550 licensed guide-interpreters are registered with these organizations, each carrying a registration card issued by the governor of the relevant prefecture.\n\nJNTO maintains 20 offices around the world. Overseas offices provide up-to-date information on travel to and within Japan, place publicity in the media and cooperate with journalists, participate in travel fairs and exhibitions, assist the local travel industry in developing tours, and conduct tourism-related research.\n\n"}

{"id": "6263825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6263825", "title": "Land of Unreason", "text": "Land of Unreason\n\nLand of Unreason is a fantasy novel by American writers Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague de Camp. It was first published in the fantasy magazine \"Unknown Worlds\" for October, 1941 as \"The Land of Unreason\". Revised and expanded, it was first published in book form by Henry Holt and Company in 1942. It has been reprinted numerous times since by various publishers, including by Ballantine Books in January 1970 as the tenth volume of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series. An E-book edition was published by Gollancz's SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form.\n\nFred Barber, an American staying as a guest in an English country home during World War II, consumes a bowl of milk left as an offering for the fairies, substituting liquor in its place. The rightful recipient of the offering, drunk and offended at the substitution, takes vengeance by kidnapping Barber off to the Land of Faerie as a changeling, a fate normally reserved for infants. He finds Faerie beset by a menace echoing the war in his own world. Trapped in a magical realm where rationality as he knows it is turned upside-down and failure to follow the rules can have dire consequences, Barber undertakes a quest in the service of Oberon, the fairy king, in order to be returned to his own world. The outcome, befitting a realm in which nothing is as expected, is one that neither he nor the reader anticipates, for Fred Barber is not quite the man he thinks he is...\n\nOrville Prescott of \"The New York Times\" found the novel \"much less successful\" than \"The Incomplete Enchanter\", saying that \"Successful fantasy requires a deft delicacy of touch quite lacking in the heavy-handed technique\" used here. Another \"Times\" reviewer, Beatrice Sherman, however, praised \"Land\" for its \"piquant style that combines the medieval phrasing of the fairy-folk's conversation, the very modern talk and turns of thought of the changeling hero, and descriptions practical and poetical of the eerie magic scenery\". \"New Worlds\" reviewer James Cawthorn declared the novel a \"witty exploration of the world of Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\"\". Ron Goulart described \"Land\" as \"a screwball comedy . . . an affable novel, and for all its preoccupation with drinking and jumping into bed, a gentle one.\" Baird Searles noted the novel's \"Alice-in-Wonderland surrealism, particularly when the inhabitants of Fairyland get going on logic-chopping and semantics. But the logic of this novel is illogic; the reason for it unreason; somehow it all hangs together triumphantly nonetheless\". E. F. Bleiler found it \"one of the better semihumorous heroic fantasies, a good child of \"Phantastes\", with clever integration of incident and theme\".\n\n"}
{"id": "9412160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9412160", "title": "Lapel pin", "text": "Lapel pin\n\nA lapel pin is a small pin worn on clothing, often worn on the lapel of a jacket. Lapel pins can be ornamental or can indicate wearer's affiliation with an organization or cause. Before the popularity of wearing lapel pins, boutonni√®res were worn.\n\nLapel pins are frequently used as symbols of achievement and belonging in different organizations. Lapel pins from the organization are often collected by members and non-members alike.\n\nBusinesses also use lapel pins to designate achievement and membership. Lapel pins are a common element of employee recognition programs, and they are presented to individuals as a symbol of an accomplishment. Like fraternity and sorority pins, these lapel pins instill a sense of belonging to an elite group of performers at the organization. Businesses also award lapel pins to employees more frequently to boost employee morale, productivity, and employee engagement.\n\nThe Soviet Union had great production of these. Besides pins showing political figures and as souvenirs for tourist spots, there were pins for various sports, cultural, and political gatherings and for technical achievements of the Soviet Union. The pins had countercultural meanings as well; for example, the pin featuring the robot spacecraft Kosmos 186 (which approached and docked with Kosmos 188) had a sexual connotation.\n\nIn recent years, pin collecting and trading has also become a popular hobby. Demand for pin designs based on popular cartoon characters and themes such as Disney, Betty Boop, and Hard Rock Cafe has surged and led to the creation of pin trading events and other social activities. Disney pin trading is a prime example of this.\n\nIn the USSR and the People's Republic of China, the prominent lapel pins with portraits of Lenin and Mao Zedong, respectively, were worn by youth as well as by Communist party members or people who felt like showing their official political credo. In Czechoslovakia, the Mao badges/pins were worn in the late 1960s and early 1970s by non-conformist youth as a prank and a way to provoke the \"normalisationist\" reactionaries of the purged post-1968 Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn the 1970s, initiates of Guru Maharaj Ji extensively used buttons, sometimes quite large, with images of the guru's face on them.\n\nSenior politicians in the UK's government, wore official Games pins for the London 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\nPin design starts off very similar to animation. Everything is hand drawn with a blue line. It is done either digitally or on paper with a light-box to plan out all of the elements and artwork that make up the design. Once the design is approved, it is inked, colored, and placed on a mechanical sheet, which is like a blueprint for the pin, with appropriate measurements and call-outs for manufacturing the parts.\n\nStep 1: Stamping Molding\n\nMolds the metal surface to form the design.\n\nStep 2: Outline Cutting\n\nStep 3: Attachment\n\nSolder attachment onto the back of each piece.\n\nStep 4: Plating\n\nPlating now can be processed. The quality of plating varies with the length of time the metal is soaked in the plating liquid.\n\nStep 5: Polishing\n\nThe metal surface is then polished until it is smooth and shiny. This applies to copper material only. Iron can be polished if required, but this will incur a surcharge.\n\nStep 6: Coloring\n\nStep 7: Cleaning\n\nExcess color and impurities are then wiped off the metal surfaces.\n\nStep 8: Baking\n\nThe metal piece is baked at approximately 450F for 12 to 15 minutes.\n\nStep 9: Epoxy Coating\n\nClear epoxy is then applied to the surface to protect the enamel from color fading and cracking. (Epoxy coating is optional and provided according to customer‚Äôs requirements)\n\n\nFor budget considerations, iron material can be used instead of copper, but without polishing.\n\nAlmost all manufacturing is currently done in China, specifically in and around Kunshan, a satellite city in the greater Suzhou region that is administratively at the county-level in southeast Jiangsu, China, just outside Shanghai. Inexpensive labor in China has made non-Chinese production of lapel pins non-existent.\n\nIn the die struck manufacturing process, there are five basic types of pins: cloisonn√©, soft enamel, photo etched, screen printed and 4-color printed. In all processes, the outer shape of the pin is stamped out from a sheet of steel, aluminum, copper, brass, or iron. In the case of cloisonne and soft enamel, the shape and the design are stamped out.\n\nCloisonn√©\nSometimes called epola or hard enamel, cloisonn√© is stamped out from a sheet of copper. The stamping leaves recessed areas, or pools, which are filled with enamel powder and high fired at 800 ‚Äì 900 degrees. After cooling, the surface of the pin is ground down to a smooth finish and then the copper is plated.\n\nSoft enamel\nThis process is like epola and cloisonn√© in that strips of metal separate areas of color. Unlike cloisonn√©, the areas of color rest below the metal strip surface, which can be felt when you run your finger over the surface. Like the photo etched process, the top can be covered with protective epoxy so that the piece appears smooth.\n\nPhoto etched\nIn the photo etch process, only the shape of the piece is stamped out. The design on the face of the pin is chemically etched into the base metal, then color-filled by hand and baked before being polished. In the final step, a thin coat of clear epoxy can be applied to the surface.\n\nPhoto Dome\nThis process begins by printing the art or design on vinyl or paper and then applying it to a metal pin base. The vinyl is then coated with an epoxy dome that protects the art from wear and the elements. This process is gaining in popularity because of advances in printing resolutions and the ability to complete these pins quickly in the United States.\n\nScreen printed\nScreen printing, a.k.a. silk screening is produced by applying each color to the metal base using a \"silk screen\" process. These are blocks of solid color. A very thin epoxy coat protects the color material from scratching.\n\n4-Color process\n4-colors process, a.k.a. offset printing, allows for bleeds and blends of colors, as is used in magazines. The colors are printed in the traditional CMYK process. This style is can be used for complex art and photo reproduction. An unlimited amount of colors can be used.\n\n\nThe backside of a lapel pin holds the pin in place, and attachment pieces come in a variety of styles.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Such clashes have occurred in many countries across time, and notable incidents still regularly occur.\n\nAlthough the sight of brawling politicians is incongruous with a legislature's stately image, its occupants, like in any other workplace, are still prone to stress and anger. The confrontational nature of politics, regardless of their location, and the high stakes involved often add to the simmering tensions. \nGalusha A. Grow, no stranger to legislative violence, described the precursors thusly:\n\nNazifa Zaki and Hamida Ahmadzai fought over rocket attacks into Afghanistan from Pakistan.\n\nTax bill sparks brawls in the parliament of Algeria.\n\nRoman general and dictator Julius Caesar was famously assassinated by a group of senators on the Ides of March, 44 BC during a meeting of the Roman Senate. The senators, led by Cassius and Brutus and calling themselves Liberatores, had conspired in secret to kill Caesar and considered various ways to do so. Ultimately, they decided to kill him during a meeting of the senate, since only senators would be allowed in the meeting and Caesar would be alone. The senators drafted a fake petition requesting that Caesar hand over power to senate; Caesar called a meeting of the senate to read it. When Caesar met the senators at the Theatre of Pompey, they stabbed him repeatedly with daggers concealed under their togas, killing him. Caesar's assassination led to a civil war for control of the republic, ending ultimately with the rise of Caesar Augustus and the founding of the Roman Empire.\n\nLegislative violence has happened in Armenia.\n\nIn 2007 a fight broke out in the lower chamber of the national legislature of Bolivia, the Chamber of Deputies.

Artur Tupits of the Farmers' Assemblies then slapped Johanson in the face twice, until the two were separated. Disturbances continued on the next day. Tupits was then arrested for two months. His name inspired a new expression for a brawl in Estonian (\"tupitsat tegema\", similar to the earlier expression \"tuupi tegema\").\n\nIn 1988 when Pope John Paul II addressed the European Parliament, Ian Paisley, then an MEP, denounced him as the Antichrist and was subjected to booing by fellow MEPs who also threw objects at him; Otto von Habsburg was among those who helped physically eject him from the room.\n\nMike Hookem punched Steven Woolfe in the face at a party meeting in 2016.\n\nA brawl broke out when an argument over the composition of Georgian delegations in international institutions turned violent.\n\nA fight erupted between rival MPs in the Greek Parliament.\n\nTwo lawmakers who entered the parliament's chamber without being authorized to do so caused a scuffle then the lawmakers tried to read out their oath of office.\n\nIn January 1988, there was a riot in the Tamil Nadu state legislative assembly over a vote of majority for Janaki Ramachandran, who was serving as Chief Minister following the death in December 1987 of her husband MGR. The ADMK party had split, with most MLAs supporting her and some supporting Jayalalithaa's bid to become Chief Minister instead. The Congress party with its 60 MLAs was able to play \"kingmaker\". While the Congress-led Central Government in New Delhi ordered them to vote against Janaki, some Congress MLAs chose to resign instead, allowing the Janaki government to survive the majority vote. A riot ensued in the legislature, with members clubbing each other with microphone stands and footwear, which was finally ended by riot police who stormed the legislature and beat up everybody with their batons. The Janaki faction was however dismissed by the Central Government under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, having survived just 24 days in office. The state was placed under President's rule for a year, until the next scheduled state assembly elections in January 1989.\n\nOn 25 March 1989, a riot broke out in the state legislative assembly in Tamil Nadu between members of the ruling DMK party and the now-unified opposition ADMK party over the reading of the state budget.

The argument eventually led to Shevchenko punching Lyashko in the face.\n\nYuriy Boyko, of the centre-left Opposition Bloc, punched Oleg Lyashko in the face after the left-wing Radical Party member purportedly accused him of being a ‚ÄúKremlin agent‚Äù.\n\nIn the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, the government and the opposition are separated by red lines drawn on the carpet. The red lines in front of the two sets of benches are two sword-lengths apart (or a little more than two sword-lengths apart); a Member is traditionally not allowed to cross the line during debates, supposedly because the Member might then be able to attack an individual on the opposite side. These procedures were made because the Members were allowed to carry weapons into the House in its founding days.\n\nDuring a dispute over the conduct of British soldiers on Bloody Sunday on the day before, Independent Socialist MP Bernadette Devlin punched the Conservative Party Home Secretary Reginald Maudling. Her aggression was in response to the comments made by Maudling, who was maintaining that the British Army had fired at Bloody Sunday protesters in self-defence, contrary to the testimonies of civilian eyewitnesses (including Devlin herself). She argued that she was being denied the right to speak. Her actions resulted in her being banned from the House of Commons for six months.\n\nIn the aftermath of a rancorous debate with Labour MPs over the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, Conservative Michael Heseltine was enraged by a group who began singing \"The Red Flag\". He seized the chamber's ceremonial mace and brandished it over his head, but was restrained by Jim Prior, and after his departure legislative action was suspended for the day.\n\nFederalist Congressman Roger Griswold of Connecticut attacked Vermont Representative Matthew Lyon with a hickory walking stick in the chambers of the United States House of Representatives. Griswold struck Lyon repeatedly about the head, shoulders and arms, while Lyon attempted to shield himself from the blows. Lyon then turned and ran to the fireplace, took up a pair of metal tongs, and having armed himself thus returned to the engagement. Griswold then tripped Lyon and struck him in the face while he lay on the ground, at which point the two were separated. After a break of several minutes, however, Lyon unexpectedly pursued Griswold again with the tongs, and the brawl was re-ignited.\n\nThe two men had a prior history of conflict. On January 30 of that year, Griswold had publicly insulted Lyon by calling him a coward, and Lyon had retaliated by spitting in Griswold's face. As a result of Lyon's actions in that case, he became the first Congressman to have charges filed against him with that body's ethics committee, although he escaped censure through a vote in the House.\n\nJohn Wilson, the speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives and president of the Arkansas Real Estate Bank, stabbed Representative J. J. Anthony to death during a legislative dispute on the floor of the chamber. Anthony had suggested that bounties for the killing of wolves be administered by the president of the state bank, a responsibility comically beneath an official of Wilson's stature. Incensed, he drew a bowie knife and attacked Anthony, who was unable to defend himself despite drawing a knife of his own. Although Wilson was expelled from his office, he was later acquitted of murder.\n\nCongressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina famously assaulted Charles Sumner of Massachusetts for a previous speech of his, saying his uncle Andrew Butler took \"a mistress who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight‚ÄîI mean, the harlot, Slavery.\" After having consulted with fellow South Carolina Congressman Laurence Keitt on the situation, Brooks and Keitt decided that Sumner had the social status of a \"drunkard\" and was thus unworthy of the traditional challenge to a duel. Brooks (accompanied by Keitt), approached and confronted Sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty Senate chamber. As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks began beating Sumner severely on the head with a thick gutta-percha cane with a gold head before he could reach his feet. Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk (which was bolted to the floor), but Brooks continued to bash Sumner until he ripped the desk from the floor. By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood, and he staggered up the aisle and collapsed, lapsing into unconsciousness. Brooks continued to beat the motionless Sumner until he broke his cane, then quietly left the chamber. Several other senators attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Keitt, who had jumped into the aisle, brandishing a pistol and shouting, \"Let them be!\" Keitt was censured for his actions and resigned in protest, but was overwhelmingly re-elected to his seat by his South Carolina constituency within a month. For several decades following, Senators often carried walking canes and even revolvers in the Senate Chamber, fearing a similar assault.\n\nCongressman Laurence Keitt of South Carolina was involved in another incident of legislative violence less than two years later, starting a massive brawl on the House floor during a tense late-night debate. Keitt became offended when Pennsylvania Congressman (and later Speaker of the House) Galusha A. Grow stepped over to the Democratic side of the House chamber while delivering an anti-slavery speech. Keitt dismissively interrupted Grow's speech to demand he sit down, calling him a \"black Republican puppy\". Grow indignantly responded by telling Keitt that ‚ÄúNo negro-driver shall crack his whip over me.‚Äù Keitt became enraged and went for Grow's throat, shouting that he would \"choke him for that\". A large brawl involving approximately 50 representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep. Cadwallader Washburn of Wisconsin upended the hairpiece of Rep. William Barksdale of Mississippi. The embarrassed Barksdale accidentally replaced the wig backwards, causing both sides to erupt in spontaneous laughter. Keitt would later die of wounds following the Battle of Cold Harbor while fighting for the Confederacy.\n\nDuring an anti-slavery speech by Illinois Republican Owen Lovejoy on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on April 5, 1860, Lovejoy condemned the Democratic Party for its racist views and steadfast support of slavery. As Lovejoy gave his speech condemning the evils of slavery, several of the Democrats present in the audience, such as Roger Atkinson Pryor, grew irate and incensed over Lovejoy's anti-slavery remarks and threatened him with physical harm, brandishing pistols and canes, with several Republicans rushing to Lovejoy's defense.\n\nThe Indiana General Assembly experienced a massive brawl between Democrats and Republicans in the Indiana Senate and Indiana House of Representatives. The event began as an attempt by Democratic Governor Isaac P. Gray to be elected to the United States Senate and his own party‚Äôs attempt to thwart him. Gray was a former Republican who had been elected Governor by popular vote but was scorned as a turncoat by his new party, who maneuvered desperately (and unsuccessfully) to try to prevent his eligibility for the Senate seat. When Gray went over the head of the Democrats in arranging a midterm election for a new Lieutenant Governor, Republican Robert S. Robertson was elected with a majority of the popular vote, a situation the Democrats refused to accept despite a ruling from the Indiana Supreme Court. The matter came to a head when Robertson attempted to enter the Senate chamber to be sworn in and take his seat presiding over the session; he was attacked, beaten, and thrown bodily from the chamber by the Democrats, who then locked the chamber door, beginning four hours of intermittent mass brawling that spread throughout the Indiana Statehouse. The fight ended only after Republicans and Democrats began brandishing pistols and threatening to kill each other and the Governor was forced to deploy the Indianapolis Police Department to restore order. Subsequently, the Republican controlled House of Representatives refused to communicate with the Democratic Senate, ending the legislative session and leading to calls for United States Senators to be elected by popular vote.\n\nDuring a debate on a bill dealing with the Philippine Islands, Senator Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina accused Senator John L. McLaurin of South Carolina of \"treachery\" for siding with the Republicans in support of Philippine annexation, and alleged that McLaurin had been granted control of government patronage in South Carolina. Upon receiving word of this statement, McLaurin entered the Senate Chamber and denounced Tillman, upon which Tillman attacked him. During the fight, other senators were hit by the punches. As a result, the Senate went into closed session to debate the matter. Both senators apologized to the Senate, but almost came to blows immediately thereafter. On February 28, the Senate voted 54 to 12, with 22 abstentions, to Censure both Tillman and McLaurin. McLaurin did not seek reelection, while Tillman served in the Senate until 1918.\n\nOn the House of Representatives chamber floor, Democrat Thomas Downey of New York confronted Robert Dornan, a California Republican, and Dornan grabbed Downey's tie in response. Downey approached Dornan in response to a speech Downey had given two days earlier before the Conservative Political Action Conference, in which he called Downey a \"draft-dodging wimp\" because of Downey's repeated denouncement of US-backed antigovernment Contras rebels in Nicaragua. During the Vietnam War, Downey received a medical deferment from the draft because of a perforated eardrum. Downey had also been active in protesting the war. The Dornan-Downey beef originated two years earlier, when Downey spoke against Dornan's nomination for a position at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.\n\nThe Downey speech was made on Saturday, 2 March. On Monday afternoon, 4 March, Downey confronted Dornan, attracting dozens of viewers. Dornan claims Downey grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around, asking if he had actually called him a wimp. Dornan answered \"I did and you are.\" The exchange became heated, and at some point Dornan accused Downey of having cost him the job two years earlier. According to Downey, as he began to walk away, Dornan grabbed him by the tie and collar and threatened him with \"bodily harm.\" Dornan claimed he was just straightening Downey's tie knot, saying later, \"I like all the members to look elegant on the floor, you know.\" Dornan, according to himself and other witnesses, then told Downey to \"get out of my face.\" After, Downey went to the Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill to tell him what had happened.\n\nAfter the incident, Downey released a statement and stated through a spokesman that he would not speak to reporters \"until Dornan apologizes.\" His spokesman also said that Downey was considering filing a complaint with the House Sergeant at Arms. Several witnesses spoke about the incident. Democratic Congressman Mike Lowry said, \"Dornan grabbed Downey roughly by the collar, and I mean aggressively. None of this straighten-the-tie baloney. And he told Downey, 'Don't let me catch you off the floor, where you are protected by the sergeant at arms.' I really think Downey restrained himself.\" Republican Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey, who witnessed the altercation, said, \"I found it humorous that Downey had to run up to the Speaker when it was over to tell all. It was like a little classroom act . . . Very childish . . . I think he's made much to-do about nothing.\"\n\nThe day after the incident, House Speaker Tip O'Neill condemned the behavior, and said he told Dornan, \"You can settle it on the street, but don't settle it on the House floor.\" He also told reporters that \"discipline\" would ensue if \"anything like that\" happened again. That day, Downey stated again, \"Congressman Dornan owes me and the House of Representatives an apology.\" Dornan responded, \"Apologize for what? For calling him a wimp? I am willing to concede that perhaps he just walks, talks and acts like a little arrogant wimp. But maybe it's disinformation. Maybe he really wears a black leather jacket by night that I don't know about.\"\n\nDuring the final day of the 2007 regular session of the Alabama State Senate Republican Sen. Charles Bishop of Jasper punched Democratic Sen. Lowell Barron of Fyffe in the head after the latter allegedly called the former a \"son of a bitch\". The two were then pulled apart by bystanders in the room.\n\nDuring a vote of California budget state Assemblymen Warren Furutani and Don Wagner broke out in a fight over a comment Wagner made that Furutani deemed offensive.\n\nA bloody backroom brawl between the mayor and a council member at a city council meeting in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nDuring a contentious 2017 Texas House of Representatives session, a minor altercation was observed after State Representative Matt Rinaldi was pushed and received personal death threats. The incident occurred after Rinaldi called U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a large crowd of protesters, in opposition to the sanctuary cities ban, disrupted the legislative proceedings. Representative Poncho Nev√°rez admitted to laying hands on Rinaldi amid the fierce debates, but no arrests were made by Texas DPS.\n\nDeputy Alfonso Marquina protested the presence of a boisterous group of President Ch√°vez supporters in the audience.\n\nDuring a session of the National Assembly . The origin of the discussion had to do with the rejection by National Assembly president Diosdado Cabello to give members of the opposition a right to speak.\n\nOn 5 July 2017, colectivos and supporters of President Nicol√°s Maduro stormed the Palacio Federal Legislativo on the Independence Day of Venezuela, assaulting many members of the opposition-led National Assembly. At least 12 opposition legislators and their staff were injured as a result of the attack.\n\n\n"}

It is widely believed that pre-colonial Tagalog people were responsible for the creation of the tombs.\n\nIt is composed of fifteen limestone coffins that can be dated back from the period of 10th to 14th century based on one of National Museum's top archaeologist \"a complex archaeological site with both habitation and burial remains from the period of approximately 10th to the 14th century ... the first of its kind in the Philippines having carved limestone tombs.\" However, after carbon-dating the human bones found on the site, it was known that the age of the site is much older, between 890-1030 AD.\n\nThe archaeological site is part of 280 hectares (692 acres) of forest land that was declared a government-protected area in 1998 to keep away treasure hunters and slash-and-burn farmers. Treasure hunters looking for gold exposed some of the limestone tombs years ago, but it was only in 2011 that Manila-based archaeologists started to unearth the graves and artifacts and realize the significance of the find. Numerous fragments with peculiar inscriptions were found throughout the site. Experts noted that the tombs used to have lids that were most likely decorated with various pre-colonial designs. However, the lids, skeletons, and other death goods that were suppose to be within the tombs have already been taken by treasure hunters before scientists managed to fully study the site. Locals at the foothills of the mountain have cited white-skinned foreigners who went to the mountains years ago as the likely culprits. The National Museum of the Philippines deemed that the stolen Filipino treasures may now be in private collections or museums around the world, without anyone knowing that they were illegally taken from the Philippines and its people.\n\nThe site is the focal property of the Buenavista Protected Landscape, which is being nominated by locals in the tentative list of the Philippines for designation in the UNESCO World Heritage List. \n\nPast archaeological discoveries have shown Filipinos of that era used wooden coffins in the country's mountainous north and earthen coffins and jars elsewhere, according to Dizon, who has done extensive archaeological work and studies in the Philippines and 27 other countries over the past 35 years.\n\nIt is widely believed by the locals of Lumanay (the town encompassing the archaeological site) that the Kamhantik tombs were built by their Tagalog ancestors with the help from enchanted beings, called anitos, sent by Bathala, the supreme deity of the Tagalog ethnic people. Prior to scientific discovery, the ruins were already much known to the Lumanay townsfolk, and they consider the ruins as one of the most sacred places for the anitos, and therefore, a dambana. Due to this belief, it was only recently when the area was known to scientists. The townsfolk do not traverse the area much as they considered it too sacred, and they might disturb the anitos living within the forest and the ruins, the reason why the area was looted by white foreigners without the knowledge of the townsfolk. It was only discovered in 2011 that the area has been looted. All sarcophagi seals of the tombs were taken away, along with all sacred objects and almost all bone fragments inside the tombs.\n"}

It was founded in 2007 with headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. The company‚Äôs current vehicles include the Rally Fighter and their 3D-printed Strati and Swim vehicles. The company develops vehicles using 3D Printing and utilizes vehicle designs provided by the online community. In 2016, the company introduced an autonomous electric-powered shuttle named Olli.\n\nLocal Motors' website is a community focusing on vehicle innovation. The content is created by the users who discuss designing, engineering, and building innovative vehicles. Members contribute their own ideas and projects which are discussed with the community.\n\nCo-creation is a technique used by Local Motors, General Electric, and LEGO to enhance new product development. Select organizations have partnered with the company to facilitate co-creation of their products including US Army, Domino‚Äôs, and Airbus. Local Motors uses Co-designing type of customer co-creation in which the selective process is made by its community and some features such as frame and structure are scoped by the company. Firstly, users create drawing designs and the decorative ideas on their own style. Although the users are novices or experts, all users can participate in this step. After that users present their designs on the website, the best design selected by people in the community will be developed by the company. Finally, the company will launch the co-designing car into the market. Using Co-creation method, company gains customer‚Äôs engagement and loyalty.\n\nOne of the biggest community driven competitions was hosted by Local Motors in collaboration with Airbus.\n\nThe propositions that Local Motors offer are:\n\n- The car is produced and designed using the co-designing type of co-creation, which is called crowdsourcing.\n- The car was produced in 18 months, which is faster than the usual process by five times.\n- They are road legal cars.\n- The wheels are strong off-road wheels and are grade 8, which are used in the military.\n- About $ 3 million was spent to develop the car, which is less than the amount spent on commercial models by the automakers. The company achieved to spend about 3 million dollars by rethinking the car‚Äôs features, so they designed a five-point seat belt, which costs $10, instead of developing an airbag, which will cost them $6 million.\n\nThe Rally Fighter was the first model produced by Local Motors and is an open sourced vehicle. The car was introduced in 2009 after 18 months of development, which constitutes a record Time to Market compared to the automobile industry standards, by applying innovative technologies and crowd sourcing techniques. As the company describes it, the Rally Fighter is \"a fully capable off-road prerunner, with the amenities and luxuries of an every-day on road vehicle\".\n\nIn collaboration with Cincinnati Incorporated and Oak Ridge National Laboratory Local Motors manufactured Strati, the world's first 3D printed electric car. The printing took 44 hours to complete, and was witnessed by a live audience at the 2014 International Manufacturing Technology Show in McCormick Place, Chicago. The car consists of 50 individual parts, far less than a traditional vehicle (which is manufactured with roughly 30,000 parts). The Strati was designed by Michele Ano√®, a member of the Local Motors community, and is produced in small quantities to serve strategic partnerships, such as with NXP Semiconductors.\n\nIn 2015, the company debuted a 3D-printed car named the LM3D Swim. It was designed by Kevin Lo, a member of the Local Motors community. The materials used are 80 percent ABS plastic and 20 percent carbon fiber. The vehicle uses technology provided by IBM that offered IoT connectivity. The Swim is currently on display at the company‚Äôs location in National Harbor, Maryland.\n\nIn 2016, the company unveiled an autonomous, electric-powered bus. The vehicle was designed by Edgar Sarmiento, initially named the \"Berlino\" from the Urban Mobility Challenge: Berlin 2030. The vehicle was built by Local Motors and has IBM Watson technology installed to provide a personalized experience for riders. The vehicle was demonstrated live to their online audience on Facebook Live at a media event in National Harbor. The vehicle is still undergoing development. On January 2, 2018, Local Motors received a pledge of up to a $1 billion in financing and operational support to customers of Olli from Florida-based Elite Transportation Services (ETS) with additional funding of $20 million from Texas-based Xcelerate. \n\nOlli was manufactured in Chandler, Arizona using additive manufacturing techniques, including 3D Printing. The company has not announced pricing yet.\n\nMiami-Dade County, the State of Nevada and the Danish Vesthimmerland Municipality expressed interest in using Olli on their roadways.\n\nLocal Motors operates facilities in Phoenix, Knoxville, and National Harbor. The company also hosts educational events that are focused on technology, science, and manufacturing topics. People can visit their retail locations in Knoxville and National Harbor to purchase sustainable and locally-sourced merchandise.\n\nAs of February 2017, Local Motors has closed its Las Vegas location.

It is also spoken to a lesser extent in the German diaspora worldwide (e.g. Plautdietsch).\n\nLow German is most closely related to Frisian and English, with which it forms the Ingvaeonic group of the West Germanic languages. Like Dutch (Istvaeonic), it is spoken north of the Benrath and Uerdingen isoglosses, while (Standard) German (Irminonic) is spoken south of those lines. Like Frisian, English, Dutch and the North Germanic languages, Low German has not undergone the High German consonant shift, as opposed to German.\n\nThe Low German dialects spoken in the Netherlands are mostly referred to as Low Saxon, those spoken in northwestern Germany (Lower Saxony, Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, and Bremen) as either Low German or Low Saxon, and those spoken in northeastern Germany (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony-Anhalt, and Brandenburg) mostly as Low German. This is because northwestern Germany and the northeastern Netherlands were the area of settlement of the Saxons, while Low German spread to northeastern Germany through eastward migration of Low German-speakers.\n\nIt has been estimated that Low German has approximately 6.7 million native speakers ‚Äì 5 million in Germany, primarily Northern Germany, and 1.7 million in the Netherlands. A 2005 study by H. Bloemhof, \"Taaltelling Nedersaksisch\", showed 1.8 million spoke it daily in the Netherlands.\n\nIt has been estimated that Low German has approximately 6.7 million native speakers ‚Äì 5 million in Germany, primarily Northern Germany, and 1.7 million in the Netherlands.\n\nDialects of Low German are spoken in the northeastern area of the Netherlands (Dutch Low Saxon) and are written there with an unstandardised orthography based on Standard Dutch orthography. The position of the language is according to UNESCO vulnerable. Between 1995 and 2011 the numbers of speakers of parents dropped from 34% in 1995 to 15% in 2011. Numbers of speakers of their children dropped in the same period from 8% to 2%.\n\nVariants of Low German are spoken in most parts of Northern Germany, for instance in the states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg, Bremen, Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony-Anhalt, and Brandenburg. Small portions of northern Hesse and northern Thuringia are traditionally Low Saxon-speaking too.\nHistorically, Low German was also spoken in formerly German parts of Poland as well as in East Prussia and the Baltic States of Estonia and Latvia. The Baltic Germans spoke a distinct Low German dialect, which has influenced the vocabulary and phonetics of both Estonian and Latvian languages.\nThe historical of Low German also included contemporary northern Poland, East Prussia (the modern Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia), a part of western Lithuania, and the German communities in the Baltic states, most notably the Hanseatic cities of modern Latvia and Estonia. German speakers in this area fled the Red Army or were forcibly expelled after the border changes at the end of World War II.\n\nThe language was also formerly spoken in the outer areas of what is now the city-state of Berlin, but in the course of urbanisation and national centralisation in that city, the language has vanished (the Berlin dialect itself is a northern outpost of High German, though it has some Low German features). Under the name \"Low Saxon\", there are speakers in the Dutch north-eastern provinces of Groningen, Drenthe, Stellingwerf (part of Friesland), Overijssel, and Gelderland, in several dialect groups per province.\n\nToday, there are still speakers outside Germany and the Netherlands to be found in the coastal areas of present-day Poland (minority of ethnic German East Pomeranian speakers who were not expelled from Pomerania, as well as the regions around Braniewo). In the Southern Jutland region of Denmark there may still be some Low German speakers in some German minority communities, but the Low German and North Frisian dialects of Denmark can be considered moribund at this time.\n\nThere are also immigrant communities where Low German is spoken in the Western hemisphere, including Canada, the United States, Mexico, Belize, Venezuela, Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. In some of these countries, the language is part of the Mennonite religion and culture. There are Mennonite communities in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Kansas and Minnesota which use Low German in their religious services and communities. These Mennonites are descended from primarily Dutch settlers that had initially settled in the Vistula delta region of Prussia in the 16th and 17th centuries before moving to newly-acquired Russian territories in Ukraine in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and then to the Americas in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The types of Low German spoken in these communities and in the Midwest region of the United States have diverged since emigration. The survival of the language is tenuous in many places, and has died out in many places where assimilation has occurred. Members and friends of the Historical Society of North German Settlements in Western New York (Bergholz, NY), a community of Lutherans who trace their immigration from Pomerania in the 1840s, hold quarterly \"Plattdeutsch lunch\" events, where remaining speakers of the language gather to share and preserve the dialect. Mennonite colonies in Paraguay, Belize, and Chihuahua, Mexico have made Low German a \"co-official language\" of the community.\n\nEast Pomeranian is also spoken in parts of Southern and Southeastern Brazil, in the latter especially in the state of , being official in five municipalities, and spoken among its ethnically European migrants elsewhere, primarily in the states of Rio de Janeiro and . East Pomeranian-speaking regions of Southern Brazil are often assimilated into the general German Brazilian population and culture, for example celebrating the , and there can even be a language shift from it to in some areas. In , nevertheless, Pomeranian Brazilians are more often proud of their language, and particular religious traditions and culture, and not uncommonly inheriting the nationalism of their ancestors, being more likely to accept marriages of its members with Brazilians of origins other than a Germanic Central European one than to assimilate with Brazilians of Swiss, Austrian, Czech, and non-East Pomeranian-speaking German and Prussian heritage ‚Äì that were much more numerous immigrants to both Brazilian regions (and whose language almost faded out in the latter, due to assimilation and internal migration), by themselves less numerous than the Italian ones (with only Venetian communities in areas of highly Venetian presence conserving Talian, and other Italian languages and dialects fading out elsewhere).\n\nThere are different uses of the term \"Low German\":\n\n\nIn Germany, native speakers of Low German call their language , or . In the Netherlands, native speakers refer to their language as , , , or the name of their village, town or district.\n\nOfficially, Low German is called (Nether or Low German) by the German authorities and (Nether or Low Saxon) by the Dutch authorities. , and , are seen in linguistic texts from the German and Dutch linguistic communities respectively.\n\nIn Danish it is called , or, rarely, . Mennonite Low German is called .\n\n\"Low\" refers to the flat plains and coastal area of the northern European lowlands, contrasted with the mountainous areas of central and southern Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, where High German (Highland German) is spoken. Etymologically however, \"Platt\" meant \"clear\" in the sense of a language the simple people could understand. In Dutch and German, the word can also mean \"improper\", \"rude\" or \"too simple\" which is why the term is not popular in the Netherlands.\n\nThe colloquial term denotes both Low German dialects and any non-standard Western variety of German; this use is chiefly found in northern and Western Germany and is not considered to be linguistically correct.\n\nThe ISO 639-2 language code for Low German (Low Saxon) has been nds ( or ) since May 2000.\n\nLow German is a part of the continental West Germanic dialect continuum. To the West, it blends into the Low Franconian languages, including Dutch. A distinguishing feature between the Southern Low Franconian varieties and Low German varieties is the plural of the verbs. Low German varieties have a common verbal plural ending, whereas Southern Low Franconian varieties have a different form for the second person plural. Northern Low Franconian varieties, including standard Dutch, have also developed a common verbal plural ending.\n\nTo the South, Low German blends into the High German dialects of Central German that have been affected by the High German consonant shift. The division is usually drawn at the Benrath line that traces the \" ‚Äì \" isogloss.\n\nTo the East, it abuts the Kashubian language (the only remnant of the Pomeranian language) and, since the expulsion of nearly all Germans from the Polish part of Pomerania following the Second World War, also by the Polish language. \nEast Pomeranian and Central Pomeranian are dialects of Low German.\n\nTo the North and Northwest, it abuts the Danish and the Frisian languages. Note that in Germany, Low German has replaced the Frisian languages in many regions. Saterland Frisian is the only remnant of East Frisian language and is surrounded by Low German, as are the few remaining North Frisian varieties, and the Low German dialects of those regions have influences from Frisian substrates.\n\nSome classify the northern dialects of Low German together with English and Frisian as the \"North Sea Germanic\" or \"Ingvaeonic\" languages. However, most exclude Low German from that group often called Anglo-Frisian languages because some distinctive features of that group of languages are only partially observed in Low German, for instance the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law (some dialects have \"us\", for \"us\" whereas others have , ), and because other distinctive features do not occur in Low German at all, for instance the palatalization of /k/ (compare palatalized forms such as English \"cheese\", Frisian to non-palatalized forms such as Low German or , Dutch , German ).\n\nThe question of whether Low German, as spoken today, should be considered a separate language, rather than a dialect of German or even Dutch, has been a point of contention. Linguistics offers no simple, generally accepted criterion to decide this question.\n\nScholarly arguments have been put forward in favour of classifying Low German as a German dialect. As said, these arguments are not linguistic but rather socio-political and build mainly around the fact that Low German has no official standard form or use in sophisticated media. The situation of Low German may thus be considered a \"pseudo-dialectized abstand language\" (\"scheindialektisierte Abstandsprache\"). In contrast, Old Saxon and Middle Low German are generally considered separate languages in their own rights. Since Low German has undergone a strong decline since the 18th century, the perceived similarities with High German or Dutch may often be direct adaptations from the dominating standard language, resulting in a growing incapability of speakers to speak correctly what was once Low German proper.\n\nOthers have argued for the independence of today's Low German dialects, taken as continuous outflow of the Old Saxon and Middle Low German tradition.\n\nLow German has been recognized by the Netherlands and by Germany (since 1999) as a regional language according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Within the official terminology defined in the charter, this status would not be available to a dialect of an official language (as per article 1a), and hence not to Low German in Germany if it were considered a dialect of German. Advocates of the promotion of Low German have expressed considerable hope that this political development will at once lend legitimacy to their claim that Low German is a separate language, and help mitigate the functional limits of the language that may still be cited as objective criteria for a mere dialect (such as the virtually complete absence from legal and administrative contexts, schools, the media, etc.).\n\nAt the request of Schleswig-Holstein, the German government has declared Low German as a regional language. German offices in Schleswig-Holstein are obliged to accept and handle applications in Low German on the same footing as Standard High German applications. The ruled in a case that this was even to be done at the patent office in Munich, in a non‚ÄìLow German region, when the applicant then had to pay the charge for a translator, because applications in Low German are considered \"\" (not written in the German language).\n\n\nThe Dutch Low Saxon varieties, which are also defined as Dutch dialects, consist of:\n\nOld Saxon, also known as Old Low German, is a West Germanic language. It is documented from the 9th century until the 12th century, when it evolved into Middle Low German. It was spoken on the north-west coast of Germany and in Denmark (Schleswig-Holstein) by Saxon peoples. It is closely related to Old Anglo-Frisian (Old Frisian, Old English), partially participating in the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law.\n\nOnly a few texts survive, predominantly in baptismal vows the Saxons were required to perform at the behest of Charlemagne. The only literary texts preserved are \"Heliand\" and the Old Saxon Genesis.\n\nThe Middle Low German language is an ancestor of modern Low German. It was spoken from about 1100 to 1600. The neighbouring languages within the dialect continuum of the West Germanic languages were Middle Dutch in the West and Middle High German in the South, later substituted by Early New High German. Middle Low German was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League, spoken all around the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. It had a significant influence on the Scandinavian languages. Based on the language of L√ºbeck, a standardized written language was developing, though it was never codified.\n\nThere is a distinction between the German and the Dutch Low Saxon/Low German situation.\n\nAfter mass education in Germany in the 19th and 20th centuries, the slow decline which Low German had been experiencing since the end of the Hanseatic League turned into a free fall. The decision to exclude Low German in formal education was not without controversy, however. On one hand, proponents of Low German advocated that since it had a strong cultural and historical value and was the native language of students in northern Germany, it had a place in the classroom. On the other hand, High German was considered the language of education, science, and national unity, and since schools promoted these values, High German was seen as the best candidate for the language of instruction.\n\nInitially, regional languages and dialects were thought to limit the intellectual ability of their speakers. Because of Low German‚Äôs archaic features and constructions, historical linguists considered it ‚Äúbackwards.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt until the efforts of proponents such as Klaus Groth that this impression changed. Groth‚Äôs publications demonstrated that Low German was a valuable language in its own right, and he was able to convince others that Low German was suitable for literary arts and was a national treasure worth keeping.\n\nThrough the works of advocates like Groth, both proponents and opponents of Low German in formal education saw the language‚Äôs innate value as the cultural and historical language of northern Germany. Nevertheless, the opponents claimed that it should simply remain a spoken and informal language to be used on the street and in the home, but not in formal schooling. According to them, it simply did not match the nationally unifying power of High German. As a result, while Low German literature was deemed worthy of being taught in school, High German was chosen as the language of scholarly instruction. With High German the language of education and Low German the language of the home and daily life, a stable diglossia developed in Northern Germany. Various Low German dialects are understood by 10 million people, but many fewer are native speakers. Total users in all countries are 301,000.\n\nThe KDE project supports Low German (nds) as a language for its computer desktop environment, as does the GNOME Desktop Project. Open source software has been translated into Low German; this used to be coordinated via a page on Sourceforge, but as of 2015, the most active project is that of KDE.\n\nIn the early 20th century, scholars in the Netherlands argued that speaking dialects hindered language acquisition, and it was therefore strongly discouraged. As education improved, and mass communication became more widespread, the Low Saxon dialects further declined, although decline has been greater in urban centres of the Low Saxon regions. When in 1975 dialect folk and rock bands such as Normaal and became successful with their overt disapproval of what they experienced as \"misplaced Dutch snobbery\" and the Western Dutch contempt for (speakers of) Low Saxon dialects, they gained a following among the more rurally oriented inhabitants, launching Low Saxon as a sub-culture. They inspired contemporary dialect artists and rock bands, such as , , , \nNonetheless, the position of the language is vulnerable according to UNESCO. Between 1995 and 2011 the numbers of speakers among parents dropped from 34% in 1995 to 15% in 2011. Numbers of speakers of their children dropped in the same period from 8% to 2%. Low Saxon is still spoken more widely than in Northern Germany. A 2005 study showed that in the Tweante region 62% of the inhabitants used Low Saxon daily, and up to 75% regularly. Efforts are made in Germany and in the Netherlands to protect Low German as a regional language.\n\nAs with the Anglo-Frisian languages and the North Germanic languages, Low German has not been influenced by the High German consonant shift except for old having shifted to . Therefore, a lot of Low German words sound similar to their English counterparts. One feature that does distinguish Low German from English generally is final devoicing of obstruents, as exemplified by the words 'good' and 'wind' below. This is a characteristic of Dutch and German as well and involves positional neutralization of voicing contrast in the coda position for obstruents (i.e. t = d at the end of a syllable.) This is not used in English except in the Yorkshire dialect, where there is a process known as \"Yorkshire assimilation\".\n\nFor instance: \"water\" , \"later\" , \"bit\" , \"dish\" , \"ship\" , \"pull\" , \"good\" , \"clock\" , \"sail\" , \"he\" , \"storm\" , \"wind\" , \"grass\" , \"hold\" , \"old\" .\n\nThe table below shows the relationship between Low German consonants which were unaffected by this chain shift and their equivalents in other West Germanic languages. Contemporary Swedish and Icelandic shown for comparison; Eastern and Western North Germanic languages, respectively.\n\n\"Notes\":\n\nGenerally speaking, Low German grammar shows similarities with the grammars of Dutch, Frisian, English, and Scots, but the dialects of Northern Germany share some features (especially lexical and syntactic features) with German dialects.\n\nLow German declension has only two morphologically marked noun cases, where accusative and dative together constitute an oblique case, and the genitive case has been lost.\n\nIn most modern dialects, the nominative and oblique cases are primarily distinguished only in the singular of masculine nouns. In some Low German dialects, the genitive case is distinguished as well (e.g. varieties of Mennonite Low German.) It is marked in the masculine gender by changing the masculine definite determiner 'de' from \"de\" to \"den/d√§n\". By contrast, German distinguishes four cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative. So, for example, the definite article of the masculine singular has the forms: der (nom), den (acc), des (gen), and dem (dat.) Thus case marking in Low German is simpler than in German.\n\nIn Low German verbs are conjugated for person, number, and tense. Verb conjugation for person is only differentiated in the singular. There are five tenses in Low German: present tense, preterite, perfect, and pluperfect, and in Mennonite Low German the present perfect which signifies a remaining effect from a past finished action. For example, \"Ekj sie jekomen\", \"I am come\", means that the speaker came and he is still at the place to which he came as a result of his completed action.\n\nUnlike Dutch, German, and southern Low German, the northern dialects form the participle without the prefix \"ge-\", like the Scandinavian languages, Frisian and English. Compare to the German past participle geschlafen. This past participle is formed with the auxiliary verbs \"hebben\" \"to have\" and \"wesen/sien\" \"to be\". It should be noted that \"e-\" is used instead of \"ge-\" in most Southern (below Groningen in the Netherlands) dialects, though often not when the past participle ends with \"-en\" or in a few oft-used words like \"west\" (been).\n\nThe reason for the two conjugations shown in the plural is regional: dialects in the central area use -t while the dialects in East Frisia and the dialects in Mecklenburg and further east use -en. The -en suffix is of Dutch influence. The -t ending is however more often encountered, even in areas where -en endings were prominent due to the fact that these -t endings are seen as \"kennzeichnend Niederdeutsch\", that is to say \"a well-known feature of Low German\".\n\nThere are 26 verb affixes.\n\nThere is also a progressive form of verbs in present, corresponding to the same in the Dutch language.\nIt is formed with \"wesen\" (to be), the preposition \"an\" (at) and \"dat\" (the/it).\n\nThe forms of Low German‚Äôs adjectives are distinct from other closely related languages such as German and English. These forms fall somewhere in between these two languages. Unlike German, Low German does not have a distinction for strong and weak forms of adjectives. However, its adjectives still do have endings, whereas English adjectives do not. The adjectives in Low German make a distinction between singular and plural to agree with the nouns that it modifies. To express the difference between the singular and plural, Low German uses the following adjective endings:\n\nLike German, Low German maintains the historical Germanic distinction between the second person singular and second person plural. In English and German, this distinction would translate to ‚Äúthou‚Äù and ‚Äúdu‚Äù referring to one person, and ‚Äúye‚Äù and ‚Äúihr‚Äù referring to more than one person. The second person pronouns for each case are given below to further illustrate this distinction.\n\nIn the genitive (possessive) case, the pronoun functions in the same way as an adjective and so it may take an ending if needed to match the singular or plural status of the noun it is modifying. So, for example, if ‚Äúyou‚Äù possess multiple books, then [dinen] would be used to express that the singular second person possesses multiple objects: the books. If several people in the second person (‚Äúyou all‚Äù) possessed multiple books, then [jug‚Äô] would be used instead.\n\nSince there is no standard Low German, there is no standard Low German consonant system. However, one trait present in the whole Low German speaking area, is the retraction of to . \n\nThe table shows the consonant system of North Saxon, a West Low Saxon dialect.\n\nLow German is written using the Latin alphabet. There is no true standard orthography, only several locally more or less accepted orthographic guidelines, those in the Netherlands mostly based on Dutch orthography, and those in Germany mostly based on German orthography. To the latter group belongs the standard orthography devised by Johannes Sass. It is mostly used by modern official publications and internet sites, especially the Low German Wikipedia. This diversity, a result of centuries of official neglect and suppression, has a very fragmenting and thus weakening effect on the language as a whole, since it has created barriers that do not exist on the spoken level. Interregional and international communication is severely hampered by this. Most of these systems aim at representing the phonetic (allophonic) output rather than underlying (phonemic) representations, but trying to conserve many etymological spellings. Furthermore, many writers follow guidelines only roughly. This adds numerous idiosyncratic and often inconsistent ways of spelling to the already existing great orthographic diversity.\n\nIn 2011, writers of the Dutch Low Saxon Wikipedia developed a spelling that would be suitable and applicable to all varieties of Low Saxon in the Netherlands, although the semi-official dialect institutes have not picked up on this, or indicated that they believed that yet another writing system will only further confuse dialect writers rather than suit them. The new spelling was introduced to the Dutch Low Saxon Wikipedia to unify the spelling of categories, templates and comparable source code writings.\n\nIn 2018, a team of writers from both the Dutch and the German Low Saxon Wikipedia completed the New Saxon Spelling, which aims to unite the different spelling systems of the Netherlands and Germany. Unlike traditional spelling systems, this spelling does not focus on correct display of pronunciation, but instead seeks mutual legibility for both German and Dutch readers of Low Saxon, based on etymology. Readers may apply their own pronunciation. As such, it can be seen as an extension of the Algemeyne Schrievwies' by Reinhard Franz Hahn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is known for her speeches and her blog BrainPickings.org, which features her writing on culture, books, philosophy and eclectic subjects on and off the Internet.\n\nPopova's parents are ethnic Bulgarians who met in Russia when they were both foreign exchange students in the early 1980s. Popova was born in Bulgaria in 1984. Her mother studied library science, while her father studied engineering and eventually became an Apple salesman. During Popova's childhood, one of her grandmothers often read to her from a collection of encyclopedias. Because of her influence, Popova was exposed to a vast amount of knowledge at a young age, which fueled her curiosity about the world. Popova first worked when she was 8 years old, making martenitsas having set up a lemonade stand-esque shop on the street to sell them.\n\nPopova graduated from the American College of Sofia in Bulgaria in 2003. She attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she earned a degree in Communications, though her grandmother wanted her to get an MBA. Popova paid for her tuition by working four part-time jobs on top of a full college course load: as an advertising representative for \"The Daily Pennsylvanian\", as an intern for a local writer, as an employee for a work-study job at the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts, and as a staff member for a small start-up advertising agency in Philadelphia.\n\nIn 2005, while Popova worked at an advertising agency, she noticed that her co-workers were circulating information within the advertising industry around the office for inspiration. However, Popova thought creativity was better sparked with exposure to information outside of the industry one was familiar with. In an effort to stir creativity, she regularly sent emails to the entire office containing five things that had nothing to do with advertising, but were meaningful, interesting, or important. Because of the popularity of the emails, Popova felt that there was an \"intellectual hunger for that sort of cross-disciplinary curiosity and self-directed learning.\"\n\nPopova told her boss that she would start her own mailing for inspiration, and called this mailing \"Brain Pickings\". She then enrolled in a night class to learn web design, took Brain Pickings online, and let the project grow organically.\n\nAfter Popova graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, she got a job and applied for a visa to stay in the United States. However, 2007 was the year the \"Visagate\" scandal occurred. As a result, though Popova filed for a visa on the first day, she was in the two-thirds of the applicants who were unsuccessful. Instead, she received an OPT, which allows a year's worth of work with a company. At the end of 2008, she returned for a while to Bulgaria, where she and some friends organized TEDxBG, modeled after TED Talks. When the visa application process opened up again, she successfully secured a visa and moved to Los Angeles in January 2010, but disliked it immensely. Popova then moved to New York later that year, where she still resides today.\n\nPopova is most notable for \"Brain Pickings\", a popular blog that began as a weekly email to seven of her friends around 2006. Now a website, Twitter feed, and weekly digest, Brain Pickings covers a wide variety of cultural topics: history, current events, and images and texts from the past. It includes several sections and has graphics, photographs, and illustrations in addition to written content.\n\nAs of December 2012, the blog was receiving 1.2 million visitors a month. Among its followers are William Gibson, Josh Groban, Drew Carey, Guy Spier, David Eagleman, Mia Farrow, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams. Anne-Marie Slaughter describes Popova's blog as \"like walking into the Museum of Modern Art and having somebody give you a customized, guided tour.\"\n\nIn addition to running Brain Pickings, Popova has a number of side projects. She maintains a newsletter, a Twitter account, and has numerous Google Plus subscribers. In 2012, she created the \"Literary Jukebox\", a sub-site where she matches quotes from books with songs. \"Music, for me, is an enormous trigger of mnemonic associations ‚Äì of time, place, mood, emotion, the smell of fresh-cut grass behind your best friend‚Äôs house when you were 18 and first heard that song.\"\n\nPopova also has various partnerships with prominent organizations. She is an MIT Futures of Entertainment Fellow. Additionally, Popova serves as the editorial director at the higher education social network Lore, run by Noodle. She edits \"Explore\", a partnership site with the Noodle educational search company. Popova has also written for \"The Atlantic\", \"Wired UK\", \"Good Magazine\", \"The Huffington Post\", and Nieman Journalism Lab.\n\nPopova filters through the large amounts of content she reads each day through a detailed selection process. When choosing content for Brain Pickings, she asks herself three things: \nWhen choosing material to publish on Brain Pickings, she aims to \"share content that is meaningful. Often, it‚Äôs timeless.\" Popova also seeks out content that has narrative. As she states, \"Curation is a form of pattern recognition ‚Äì pieces of information or insight which over time amount to an implicit point of view.\" Popova publishes this information in tweet form when she does not have much to add. On the other hand, she publishes this as blog posts when she feels she can deepen the subject with historical background or additional materials.\n\nMaria Popova has received numerous instances of media recognition for her work. In 2012, she was named number 51 of the 100 most creative people in business by \"Fast Company\" magazine. Popova was featured in \"30 under 30\" by Forbes as one of the most influential individuals in Media and was listed on ‚ÄúThe 140 Best Twitter Feeds of 2012 List‚Äù by \"Time\" magazine. Popova‚Äôs work has also been spotlighted and profiled in publications such as \"The New York Times\".\n\nPopova has been very vocal about her dislike for traditional advertising, and has repeatedly expressed her pride on being advertising-free: \nIn 2013, Popova received criticism on how she championed her site to be \"ad-free\" and a \"labor of love\" that requires reader donations to sustain itself, while she covertly received revenue from affiliate advertising from Amazon. Tom Bleymaier, founder of a startup in Palo Alto, California, wrote a post on an anonymous Tumblr blog calling Popova out for her actions. Using his own calculations, Bleymaier extrapolated that Popova could make anywhere between $240,000 and $432,000 a year with these affiliate advertisements.\n\nThis received much media attention from sources such as Reuters and PandoDaily. Popova herself responded to the Reuters article written by Felix Salmon in an email where she addressed factual errors concerning the amount of income from the affiliate advertisements mentioned in the Reuters article.\n\nThis incident has sparked a more general debate on the Internet about whether or not affiliate advertisements are \"sneaky\" or \"deceptive\". Popova has since updated her donation page on Brain Pickings to acknowledge the fact that she receives income from affiliate advertisements.\n\nIn 2012, Popova created \"The Curator's Code\", a project by Popova with input from designer Kelli Anderson. The Curator‚Äôs Code is a code of conduct for curators on the web to use. This proposed method is an attempt to codify source attribution on the internet to ensure that the intellectual labor of information discovery is honored. Under the code, the \"via\" symbol indicates direct discovery, where the \"hat tip\" symbol indicates an indirect link of discovery.\n\nThe Curator's Code was controversial, and received mixed responses. The announcement of this project elicited feedback from people who \"worry about the meaning of curation\". In a blog post, Marco Arment stated that \"codifying 'via' links with confusing symbols is solving the wrong problem\". Most criticism of The Curator‚Äôs Code voiced uncertainty about its ability to solve the problems of online attribution. A few critics argued that the problems of online attribution are not due to a lack of codified syntax, but rather due to the \"economics and realities of online publishing\".\n\n"}

The series launched the careers of several high-profile actors and writers, and also led to other comedic series including \"Blackadder\", \"Mr. Bean\", and \"Alas Smith and Jones\".\n\nThe series benefited from video editing and recording techniques. The pace was enhanced by jump-cutting between library clips, usually of politicians, royalty, or celebrities. Then-PM Margaret Thatcher complained when, by adroit image editing, the show implied she had crashed a car. Effects used in pop videos, provided by the Quantel Paintbox, were often a highlight of the musical numbers.\n\n\"Not the Nine O'Clock News\" was produced by John Lloyd. Lloyd pitched the idea to the heads of BBC Comedy and Light Entertainment and was given a six-show series on condition that he collaborate with Sean Hardie, who had worked in current affairs at the BBC. The idea came from the then-recent publication of \"Not The New York Times\", a spoof of the famed paper which was not circulating at the time because of a general strike occurring in the city, leaving it with no papers.\n\nInitially, Lloyd and Hardie were considering doing a lampoon of actuality programmes \"√† la\" \"The Frost Report\" with Rowan Atkinson portraying an old-fashioned host attacking liberal and/or modern trends. The show was to be called \"Sacred Cows\" but the news show was chosen because of its larger quantity of sources. As well as the homage to \"Not The New York Times\", the show's name derived from its schedule, as it originally aired on BBC2 at the same time as the \"Nine O'Clock News\" on BBC1.\n\nAside from Atkinson, the original cast comprised Christopher Godwin, John Gorman, Chris Langham, Willoughby Goddard, and Jonathan Hyde, and the first episode of a planned series of shows was scheduled for 2 April 1979. The episode also featured Chris Emmett (impersonating Denis Healey), Robert Llewelyn (impersonating Bob Hope) and Hertz Rental (narrating general elections in Greenland). As the show was originally scheduled to air in \"Fawlty Towers\"' timeslot, John Cleese was to have introduced the first episode in a sketch referring to a technicians' strike then in progress that hindered the production of the show, explaining (in character as Basil Fawlty) that there was no show that week so a \"tatty revue\" would be broadcast instead. However the 1979 general election intervened, and the show was pulled as too political, being replaced with repeats of American sitcom \"Rhoda\".\n\nThe sketch with Cleese was broadcast later that year, when the final episode of \"Fawlty Towers\" went out during the broadcast run of the first series of \"Not the Nine O'Clock News\", though the significance of the sketch was lost. This link is included on the Region 2 \"Fawlty Towers\" DVD boxset. Basil's waiter Manuel also appeared at the end of the unaired episode, trying to get a joke about the Ayatollah's contact lenses. Other sketches of the unaired first episode were also lifted or remade on episodes throughout the show. Healey's and Hope's impressions were achieved by the use of \"talking head\" puppets, which in the mid-80s would become a characteristic staple of \"Spitting Image\", which Lloyd produced in its early series.\n\nLloyd and Hardie decided to recast the show, retaining Langham and Atkinson. They wanted to bring in a woman. Victoria Wood turned the show down. Lloyd met Pamela Stephenson at a party and she agreed to join. Atkinson, Langham, and Stephenson were joined by Mel Smith, who was scheduled to work on the pilot, but he declined after reading the script (he called the finished episode in retrospect as \"the worst half hour of TV\" he ever saw). The first series was criticised for being \"a poor mix of stand up, and a mild portion of sketches\" and newspaper reviews referred it to as \"extremely offensive\" and that \"should not be allowed on TV\", ratings were dismal as well: the first episode had fewer than one million viewers. However the network controller reportedly liked the programme so much, that a second series of seven episodes was commissioned.\n\nFor the second series, Langham was replaced by Griff Rhys-Jones, who had already appeared in minor roles, aside from having directed \"The Atkinson People\" radio show. The second series won the Silver Rose at the Montreux Festival and a BAFTA award for Best Light Entertainment Programme in 1982. The show's later series achieved improved ratings.\n\n\"Not the Nine O'Clock News\" became a stage show in Oxford and London in 1982, but the main performers decided to end the project while it was a success: Stephenson began a Hollywood film career, Atkinson recorded the first series of \"Blackadder\" in 1983, and Smith and Jones became a double act in \"Alas Smith and Jones\". An American adaptation, \"Not Necessarily the News\" ran for seven years, from 1983‚Äì90 on the Home Box Office cable television channel.\n\nSatire was a key theme in the show's comedy. One spoof news element for example might include a routine announcement that NASA had once again announced a delay in the launch of its space shuttle owing to technical difficulties, as the screen showed the shuttle on its launch pad with oxygen streaming off the tanks, overlaid with the sound of a car engine turning over but not starting. An opening graphic featured the same blue screen and white analog clock ticking down to 9:00 p.m. as preceded the original Nine O'Clock News, followed by an announcement of the time in similar voice and, in parody, the announcement that this was \"definitely \"not\" the Nine O'Clock News.\" Skits could include things like a group of rural Americans at a barbecue singing a several minutes of comical implausibles like \"I'm prepared to believe that that Nixon wasn't a crook; I'm prepared to believe Love Story's a readable book...\" and finally concluding, \"I believe that the devil is ready to repent; - but I can't believe Ronald Reagan is president.\" \n\nThe show is credited with bringing alternative comedy to British television: Lloyd once commented he wanted to do a \"modern, working-class\" comedy in contrast to other shows of the time such as \"The Two Ronnies\". This also happened at a time that the \"National Lampoon\" magazine, \"The Second City\" troupes and \"Saturday Night Live\" became showcases of alternative comedy in North America.\n\nIn 2005, Rowan Atkinson, Mel Smith, Pamela Stephenson, Chris Langham, and John Lloyd reunited to talk to Sue MacGregor about the show. Langham's departure was touched upon, with Lloyd seeming to take the blame, though Atkinson had campaigned for Langham to be kept in the cast (Langham actually refused to speak to his former cast-mates for a number of years after he was fired, until appearing as a regular on \"Smith & Jones\" in the 1990s). \"The Reunion\" was broadcast on Radio 4 on 31 July 2005.\n\nA documentary featuring the cast reminiscing about the making of the programme was shown on BBC 2 on 28 December 2009, before one of the 1995 compilation shows was aired (despite a \"complete episode\" being billed in television listings). The documentary was repeated on 3 August 2013, just over two weeks after the death of Mel Smith.\n\nThe main writers included Colin Bostock-Smith, Andy Hamilton, Peter Brewis, Richard Curtis, and Clive Anderson. However, the producers accepted scripts for sketches from a wide range of writers and ensured the show remained topical by recording sketches only days before broadcast. Howard Goodall (subsequently composer of the \"Red Dwarf\", \"Blackadder\", and \"The Vicar of Dibley\" theme music) was musical director. Bill Wilson directed the first three series, Geoff Posner the fourth.\n\nA total of 27 episodes of 25‚Äì30 minute duration were produced over four series.\n\n\nThe series has rarely been repeated; eight re-cut and condensed (to make it \"faster and funnier than ever\") \"episodes\" made for a video edition in 1995 are shown instead. This is primarily because the original episodes in their entirety lampooned events that were in the news at the time.\n\nTwo highly edited videos of the show, entitled \"Nice Video, Shame about the Hedgehog\" and \"The Gorilla Kinda Lingers\", were released in 1995.\n\nIn August 2003 these videos were released on DVD under the title of \"The Best of Not the Nine O'Clock News: Volume One\". \"The Best of Not the Nine O'Clock News: Volume Two\" came a year later. Both of these are available in one set, unavailable separately, in Region 1.\n\nThree vinyl albums were released at the time the series was screening, entitled \"Not the Nine O'Clock News\", \"Hedgehog Sandwich\", and \"The Memory Kinda Lingers\" respectively. These albums were very successful, with the first two both reaching the top ten of the UK albums chart, a rare feat for a spoken word album.\n\nThe original version of \"The Memory Kinda Lingers\" was a double LP. The second disc is titled \"Not in Front of the Audience\" and is a live recording of the cast's stage show. \"Hedgehog Sandwich\" and the first disc of \"The Memory Kinda Lingers\" were later combined on a BBC double-length cassette and double-CD set.\n\n\"The Ayatollah Song\" b/w \"Gob on You\" (as featured in the TV show) and \"I Like Trucking\" b/w \"Supa Dupa\" were also released as singles.\n\nThree books were released to tie in with the series: \"Not! the Nine O'Clock News\", a collection of classic material rewritten and restructured as a parody of the short-lived \"Now!\" magazine; \"Not the Royal Wedding\" (the royal wedding in question being the marriage of Charles and Diana); and \"Not the General Election\", a tie-in with the 1983 General Election. The first was reprinted in 1995 as \"Not for Sale\". \"Not the Royal Wedding\" was promoted by a little-known radio spinoff, \"Not the Nuptials\", transmitted on BBC Radio 1. The same station had also previously produced a behind-the-scenes documentary on \"Not the Nine O'Clock News\" as part of their magazine series \"Studio B15\".\n\nTwo 'page-a-day' tear-off calendars, edited by John Lloyd and containing several contributions from Douglas Adams, were released in the early 1980s (\"Not 1982\" and \"Not 1983\"). Also published around this time was a spoof Orwellian edition of \"The Times\" newspaper, \"Not The 1984 Times\", which although widely assumed to be, was not actually connected to the series.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6085509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6085509", "title": "Open-source religion", "text": "Open-source religion\n\nOpen-source religions employ open-source methods for the sharing, construction, and adaptation of religious belief systems, content, and practice. In comparison to religions utilizing proprietary, authoritarian, hierarchical, and change-resistant structures, open-source religions emphasize sharing in a cultural Commons, participation, self-determination, decentralization, and evolution. They apply principles used in organizing communities developing open-source software for organizing group efforts innovating with human culture. New open-source religions may develop their rituals, praxes, or systems of beliefs through a continuous process of refinement and dialogue among participating practitioners. Organizers and participants often see themselves as part of a more generalized open-source and free-culture movement.\n\nIn 1994, with his essay, \"The Holy War: Mac vs. DOS,\" the scholar and novelist Umberto Eco popularized the use of religious metaphors in comparing operating system design and user experience. By the late 1990s, the term \"open-source religion\" began appearing in technology magazines as a reference to the open-source Linux operating system's organizing principle and as an analogy for highlighting the philosophical differences between advocates of open-source vs. proprietary software . In 2001, Daniel Kriegman began describing a religion he invented called Ozacua (later Yoism) as \"the world's first opensource religion.\" The concept of an \"open source religion\" was further expanded upon by the media theorist, Douglas Rushkoff in his book, \"Nothing's Sacred: The Truth about Judaism\" (2003), where he offered the following description as an introduction to Open Source Judaism:\n\nBefore the coinage of the term open-source in 1998 or even the birth of the Free Software movement, the \"Principia Discordia\", a Discordian religious text written by Greg Hill with Kerry Wendell Thornley, included the following Copyright disclaimer in its 4th edition (1970), \"‚ìÄ ALL RIGHTS REVERSED ‚Äì Reprint what you like.\" By the summer of 1970, the implications of the disclaimer were being discussed in other underground publications.\n\nVia the counterculture, by the mid-1970s, the concept had influenced a generation of Discordians including the nascent hacker culture. The project to create Tiny BASIC was proposed in Bob Albrecht and Dennis Allison's \"Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics & Orthodontia\", a journal of the Homebrew Computer Club, a small group of computer hobbyists who began meeting in 1975 around Silicon Valley. The first lines of the source code for Tiny Basic as released in 1976 by Li-Chen Wang stated ‚Äò(‚ÜÑ) COPYLEFT ALL WRONGS RESERVED‚Äô. In 1984/5 programmer Don Hopkins sent Richard Stallman a letter labeled \"Copyleft‚Äîall rights reversed\". Stallman chose the phrase to identify his free software method of distribution. The relationship between Discordianism and \"Kopyleft\" remain part of the culture of Discordianism, as explained by the Discordian Rev. Dr. Jon Swabey in his \"Apocrypha Discordia.\"\n\nFor established traditions whose canonical works, records of discourse, and inspired artworks reside in the public domain, keeping these works open and available in the face of proprietary interests has inspired several open-source initiatives. Open access to resources and adaptive reuse of shared materials under open content licensing provide a structure by which communities can innovate new religious systems collaboratively under the aegis of copyright law. For some religious movements, however, public access and literacy, and the potential of adaptive reuse also provide an opportunity for innovation and reform within established traditions. In an interview by Alan Jacobs in \"The Atlantic\" magazine on open-source religion, Aharon Varady (founding director of the Open Siddur Project) explained that \"cultures breathe creativity like we breathe oxygen\" arguing that open-source provides one possible strategy for keeping a tradition vibrant while also preserving historical works as non-proprietary during a period of transition from analog to digital media.\n\nAlthough a work of radical 1960s Jewish counterculture rather than an explicitly religious work, the satirical songbook \"Listen to the mocking bird\" (Times Change Press, 1971) by the Fugs' Naphtali \"Tuli\" Kupferberg contains the earliest explicit mention of \"copyleft\" in a copyright disclaimer. Later open-source efforts in Judaism begin to appear in 1988 with the free software code written for calculating the Hebrew calendar included in Emacs. After the popularization of the term \"open-source\" in 1998, essays and manifestos linking open-source and Judaism began appearing in 2002 among Jewish thinkers familiar with trends in new media and open-source software. In August 2002, Aharon Varady proposed the formation of an \"Open Siddur,\" an open-source licensed user-generated content project for digitizing liturgical materials and writing the code needed for the web-to-print publishing of Siddurim (Jewish prayer books). Meanwhile, media theorist Douglas Rushkoff began articulating his understanding of open-source in Judaism. \"The object of the game, for me,\" Rushkoff explained, \"was to recontextualize Judaism as an entirely Open Source proposition.\"\nThe term \"Open Source Judaism\" first appeared in Douglas Rushkoff's book \"Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism\" (2003). Rushkoff employed the term \"Open Source\" to describe a democratic organizational model for collaborating in a commonly held source: the Hebrew Bible and other essential works of Rabbinic Judaism. Rushkoff conceived of Judaism as essentially an open-source religion which he conceived as, \"the contention that religion is not a pre-existing truth but an ongoing project. It may be divinely inspired, but it is a creation of human beings working together. A collaboration.\" For Rushkoff, open-source offered the promise of enacting change through a new culture of collaboration and improved access to sources. \"Anyone who wants to do Judaism should have access to Judaism. Judaism is not just something that you do, it's something you enact. You've got to learn the code in order to alter it.\" The 2003 publication of Rushkoff's book \"Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism\" and an online forum dedicated to \"Open Source Judaism\" inspired several online projects in creating web applications for generating custom made haggadot for Passover, however neither content nor code for these were shared under free-culture compatible open content terms.\n\nBeginning with the Open Siddur Project in 2009, open-source projects in Judaism began to publicly share their software code with open-source licenses and their content with free-culture compatible open content licenses. The explicit objectives of these projects also began to differ from Rushkoff's \"Open Source Judaism.\" Rather than seek reforms in religious practices or doctrines, these projects used Open Content licenses to empower users to access and create their own resources from a common store of canonical texts and associated translations and metadata. By 2012, open-source projects in Judaism were mainly active in facilitating collaboration in sharing resources for transcribing and translating existing works in the Public Domain, and for adaptation and dissemination of works being shared by copyright owners under Open Content licenses.\n\nFollowing proprietary claims on Yoga movements by some Yoga instructors, Open Source Yoga Unity was formed in 2003 to assert that Yoga movements reside in the public domain. The organization provides a common voice, and the pooling of resources, to legally resist the application of a proprietary Copyright to any Yoga style thereby \"ensuring its continued natural unfettered practice for all to enjoy and develop.\" The organization explains, that \"while we appreciate the teachings of yoga teachers, we do not believe that they have the legal right to impose control over another's Yoga teaching or practice.\" In Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Choudhury (2005), the organization settled out of court, avoiding a federal court hearing to determine whether Bikram Choudhury‚Äôs copyrighted sequence of 26 poses and two breathing exercises could be legally protected.\n\nConcerned with the lack of a source text containing documentation on Wicca in the tradition of Gerald Gardner, Dr. Leo Ruickbie self-published \"Open Source Wicca: The Gardnerian Tradition\" (2007) for \"putting you back in control of spirituality.\" The work, a collection of \"the original foundation documents of Wicca\" authored between 1949 and 1961, was published digitally and in print under a Creative Commons Attribution license.\n\nSeveral projects aiding individuals and communities in formulating their own belief systems cite inspiration from ideas common to the open-source movement and self-identify as open-source religions or religious initiatives. The establishment of new religions through open-source methods is closely related to chaos magic, which emphasizes the pragmatic use of belief systems and the creation of new and unorthodox methods, the difference being that any knowledge gained through such innovation is shared openly.\n\nAccording to its founder, Daniel Kriegman, Yoism (founded 1994) combines rational inquiry, empiricism, and science with Spinozan or Einsteinian pantheism. Inspired by the Linux operating system, Kriegman describes his religion as \"open-source\" and explains that, similar to open-source software projects, participants in Yoism do not owe their allegiance to any leader and that their sense of authority emerges via group consensus decision-making. Yoism adopted the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike copyleft license for sharing original works in May 2015.\n\nThe Belief Genome Project aims to use crowdsourcing to catalog all beliefs as a resource for those wishing to build and discover their own belief system. The project is an initiative of the Open Source Religion Social Network , a website established in 2009 by Sidian M.S. Jones which he described as \"a system for the mixing of religious and non-religious beliefs in an individual, even across multiple religions.\"\n\nHuman Worship, or Open Religion, is an \"eternal tradition of considering Human absolute, highest value\", \"considering God as Human continuation to infinity through Soul\", described in its sacred book, shared in public domain by the formula \"All rights reserved for God. Open Soul Holy Scripture of Human Worship is word of God, common heritage of Humankind, published anonymously, free for copying\". The blessing gesture and sacred sign of Open Religion is the circle or zero, with the human in the center of coordinates. Human Worshippers bow to every human soul, laying the hand on heart and saying \"Believe in yourself!\". They organize \"soul societies\" for missionary work, friendship, love and common joy. Also they believe in every human having the capacity to be a prophet, every human action to be prayer and all consequences as revelation from God, claiming that practical experience inspires true faith and skeptics are the same holy persons as prophets.\n\n\n\n"}

Between 1995 and 2013 he worked in Ireland where he occupied at the end the position of a senior research fellow at University College Cork, School of Applied Social Studies. 2013 he moved to Rome, Italy where he worked independently, but in close connection with the Italian research institute EURISPES. From 2015 to 2017 he worked as Professor for Economics at Bangor College of Central South University of Forestry & Technology, ChangSha, PRC, and as Senior Foreign Expert. School of Public Affairs, Dept. of Social Security and Risk Management, Zhejiang University, HangZhou, P.R.China. In September 2017 he commenced a one-year research position at the Max Planck Institute for Social Law and Social Policy in Munich, Bavaria, from where he changed in October 2018 to the Faculty of Economics and Sociology at the University of Lodz in Poland.\n\nBesides, he is associate professor at the Department of Social Sciences of the University of Eastern Finland [www.uef.fi] and he holds a permanent visiting professorship as honorary associate professor at the Corvinus University (Faculty of Social Sciences and International Relations, Institute of World Economy) in Budapest, Hungary. Since November 2013 he is also Visiting Scholar at the Department of Chinese Studies at NUI Maynooth , Ireland.\n\nUntil 2013 he had been director of the independent research institute ESOSC (European Social, Organisational and Science Consultancy) with headquarter in Aghabullogue, Ireland. After the move to Italy the work of the institute had been discontinued.\n\nHerrmann was born into a bourgeois family and had been brought up in a protestant milieu, however without being embedded in a strictly religious environment.\nDuring his youth he had been politically engaged in different ways, distancing himself increasingly from his family background.\nAt the end of his studies he married ‚Äì from the marriage, which had been later divorced, he has one daughter, Franziska Herrmann, who lives in Germany.\n\nHerrmann studied sociology (Bielefeld), political science (Leipzig) and economics (Hamburg). 1981 he obtained the diploma in sociology from the university in Bielefeld and his doctorate in philosophy in 1992 from the university in Bremen .\nAt the institute for local social policy and non-profit organisations in Bremen, Herrmann analysed in close cooperation with Rudolph Bauer and J√ºrgen Blandow the politics and policies of non-governmental organisations.\nHe focused on the meaning of the process of European integration for national social policy and the impact on the third sector.\n\nWhile studying sociology, Herrmann concentrated on sociology of organisations ‚Äì this had been also the subject of his PhD-dissertation, titled ‚ÄúSociety and organisation. An analysis of modern society‚Äù (Rheinfelden/Berlin: Sch√§uble, 1994). This work integrated topics of social policy, civil society, theory of modernisation and general philosophy. His methodological thinking had been and still is influenced by historical and dialectical materialism, systems theory and the theory of civilisation. Against this background he undertook several studies, especially in the area of European integration.\n\nBased on Herrmann‚Äôs experience gained from the work at the Platform of Social NGOs and the European Social Action Network (ESAN), he took an increasingly critical position towards the subtle mechanisms of the process of European integration.\n\nAt a very early stage Herrmann discussed and theorised processes he saw as ‚Äúpolitics bypassing the nation state‚Äù (see European Integration between Institution Building and Social Process. Contributions to a Theory of Modernisation and NGOs in the Context of the Development of the EU; New York: Nova Science, 1998 ) and which became later known under the term ‚Äúmultilevel governance‚Äù.\n\nThe close cooperation with the European Foundation on Social Quality and later International Association for Social Quality www.socialquality.eu, namely with Laurent van der Maesen, pushed his analytical interest towards the search for alternatives. His thorough research, geared against political voluntarism and based in a systematic analysis of forms of government and the respective social policy gave important impulses for the debates on social quality thinking.\n\nResearch visits in ‚Äì amongst others ‚Äì Australia (at the Cairns Institute ), Austria, France, Germany, Hungary (there at the ELTE - E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd university in connection with Zsuzsa Ferge), Sweden, Taiwan (on invitation of the Institute of Humanities and Social Science) and Turkey (at ODT√ú - Orta Doƒüu Teknik √úniversitesi , supported by T√úBƒ∞TAK - T√ºrkiye bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma) strengthened his critical attitude towards traditional approaches of social policy. Increasingly important had been his orientation on a critique of political economy.\n\nBeyond the contacts mentioned before, further cooperation is important and three references are crucial.\nTogether with the Austrian political scientist and one of the founders of quantitative world systems research, Arno Tausch, Herrmann elaborated some publications. This acquainted Herrmann more with world-systems theory. It also meant strengthening his orientation on a critique of political economy. With Herrmann‚Äôs cooperation with the French Marxist economist Paul Boccara he linked his work closely with the question of the general role of the state. The common work contributed not least to Herrmann‚Äôs orientation on the work of the French regulationist approach.\n\nBased on this work he had been able to strengthen the attempts of locating the work on Social Quality within the framework of world systems theory. Currently his work focuses on establishing a political economic perspective as essential part of the social quality approach. Of special importance is the regulationist theory which is at the same time developed further by being applied within a different framework.\n\nMoreover, Herrmann is correspondent to the Max Planck Institute for Social Policy and Social Law (previously Max-Planck Institute for Foreign and International Social Law) in Munich, Germany. This allowed him to study more closely the ambiguity of social and human rights law ‚Äì issues he discussed in particular in his collaboration with Hans F. Zacher. Especially with reference to Zacher he worked on the consideration of the ‚Äúpre-legal‚Äù determination of law, thus allowing nit least an integration with political economy.\n\nHis academic work is not least expressed in his engagement as member of the scientific council of the German branch of attac and in the EuroMemo Group ‚Äì a network of economists that is looking for alternative policies.\n\nThe different connections, Herrmann established over time, based on the wide range of topics, linked him since 2011 also to the work of the Eurasian Center for Big History and System Forecasting at the Moscow State University, in particular collaborating with Andrey Korotayev and Leonid Grinin, Russia, the All-Russian Centre of Living Standard Moscow, and the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics , Moscow.\n\nAfter his move to Rome, Italy, Herrmann developed independently, but also as member of the scientific council of EURISPES [www.eurispes.eu] (Istituto di Studi Politici, Economici e Sociali), his research. Important contacts for further developments could be established to the University La Sapienza , Rome, the university Pontificia Universit√† San Tommaso d‚ÄôAquino ‚Äì Angelicum https://web.archive.org/web/20180314052843/http://pust.it/ of the Vatican www.vatican.va, the Hungarian academy of science http://mta.hu/english/, namely Ferenc Bodi.

While he sees it in part as challenge around social security and employment law. his main interest aims on clarifying the meaning of ongoing processes for the existing mode of production.\n\nIn 2015 he donated his books (as far as they had not been lost during the various moves) to EURIPSES [www.eurispes.ie], hoping that they will be in this way available for the wider public for research.\n\n"}
{"id": "14943130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14943130", "title": "Polka in the United States", "text": "Polka in the United States\n\nPolka in the United States refers to polka‚Äîa music and dance style that originated in Europe in the 1830s and came to American society when people immigrated from Eastern Europe. A fast style in 2/4 time, and often associated with the pre‚ÄìWorld War II era, polka remains a dynamic \"niche\" music in America.\n\nSeveral polka genres exist in the United States, each with its own unique characteristics and performers. Though these polka genres vary, all are unified in the expression of ethnicity by performers and participants. Polka enthusiasts gather to enjoy their love of the music and dance and to honor their heritage at polka festivals. Modern media enables these fans to stay connected and share their passion. Though it passed its heyday in the 1950s the polka remains an active music form with distinct genres, leading performers, and active organizations. Where it is popular, the polka is a manifestation of the culture of those who participate in it. It is the state dance of Wisconsin.\n\nAlthough author Charles Keil admits that \"there are as many styles of polka as there are polka localities\", he and his wife have divided American polka music into three major genres:\n\n\nThe two Slavic genres are found in eastern and midwestern America, the Germanic genres in midwestern and western America, and the Southwestern genres in southwestern America. The different genres are united by the characteristic 2/4 time signature that exists in all polkas as well as by instruments and lyrics that are similar throughout all styles. Polka bands across all genres typically include an accordion or concertina, wind instruments, and drums. The lyrics sung by these bands are united by their discussion of joy, religion, and ethnic culture. Differences stem from variations in instrumentation, tempo, and the popularity of the genre in various places.\n\nThe Polish-American style of polka is perhaps the most popular today. Polish Polka bands do not only play polkas, but also play obereks, waltzes, and sometimes tangos. In fact, the \"Polish polka\" as we know it was never danced in Poland. Rather, different forms of polka existed in Polish folk dancing. This popularity is due in part to the fact that performers in this genre have worked to appeal to a larger audience by adding covers of modern music alongside normal polkas in their albums and performances. For example, the polka band Toledo Polka Motion includes a cover of the Beatles' \"I'm a Loser\" along with traditional pieces such as \"Pod Krakowem\" on one of their albums. Polka star Jimmy Sturr has even included recordings with stars such as Willie Nelson to get the country music audience interested in polka. The hotspots for Polish-American polka are mostly in cities near the Great Lakes (especially Chicago) and some East Coast cities.\n\nPolish-American polka can be subdivided into Chicago-style and Eastern-style. The typical Chicago-style polka band includes one or two trumpets, an accordion, a concertina, drums, a bass, and sometimes a clarinet, saxophone, or fiddle. This style is connected to the '50s rock-and-roll era and is sometimes referred to as \"push\" style because of the intense \"bellow-shaking\" of the accordion. A secondary style of Chicago-style polka music is referred to as \"honky\" style; this consists of a trumpet, clarinet (doubling on saxophone), concertina or accordion, upright bass (or bass guitar), & drums. It is performed in a dixieland style, and sung primarily in the Polish language. Most polka artists add a piano on recordings for embellishment. The modern giants of Chicago-style are Lenny Gomulka and the late Eddie Blazonczyk. Both were highly influenced by the style of Li'l Wally Jagiello, a polka performer of an earlier generation. Another influential early pioneer of Chicago-style polkas was Marion Lush who has been called the \"Golden Voice\" of polkas due to his distinctive vocal stylings. (Lush died in 1993.) Blazonczyk was the leader of a band called the Versatones, who released over 50 albums. (Blazonczyk died in 2012.) Gomulka was a member of the Versatones until 1980 when he formed his own band, the Chicago Push. Some other popular modern Chicago-style polka bands include Crusade, the Polka Family, the Dynatones, and Toledo Polka Motion. In important venue for live performances of polka music was Club 505 at 13505 S Brainard Ave in the Hegewisch neighborhood on the Southeast side of Chicago. A live broadcast from Club 505 from 1959 can be heard on YouTube.\n\nEastern-style polka is similar to Chicago style but is played at a faster tempo, usually includes a bigger section of horns and reeds, and is connected to big-band era music rather than rock-and-roll. The most popular Eastern-style performer (and probably the most popular polka artist in America today) is Jimmy Sturr, winner of 15 Grammy Awards in the polka category. Other important Eastern-style performers include Frank Wojnarowski, Bernie Witkowski, and the Connecticut Twins.\n\nThe Slovenian style is generally played at a faster tempo and features different instrumentation. Whereas the Polish style utilizes trumpets and concertinas, the main melody instruments in the Slovenian band are the accordion and tenor saxophone. (often doubling on flute & clarinet during waltzes) A button accordion or \"button box\" is sometimes used instead of the piano accordion or chromatic accordion and offers a different sound. The Slovenian style also adds a banjo or guitar to bolster the rhythm section (most commonly banjo for polkas and guitar for waltzes). The epicenter of the Slovenian-American style of polka is undoubtedly Cleveland and northeast Ohio, but it is also popular in Pennsylvania and in many other cities in the Great Lakes region. The most influential figure in Slovenian-American polka is Frankie Yankovic, who helped \"Americanize\" the Slovenian polka and worked for years to popularize it, appearing throughout the country and even performing on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Other important Slovenian-style pioneers include Tony Jalovec - The Polka Maestre - Johnny Pecon, Lou Trebar, Johnny Vadnal (along with brothers Tony, Frankie, and Richie),Tony Jalovec-Polka Maestre-Canada, Kenny Bass, and Eddie Habat. The torchbearers of Slovenian-American or \"Cleveland-Style\" polka today include Jeff Pecon (Johnny's son), Joey Tomsick, Don Wojtila, Eddie Rodick, Bob Kravos and Eric Noltkamper. Like their Polish counterparts, these bands have also expanded their repertoire over the years to include a variety of styles of music including polkas, waltzes, American standards, Latin dances (cha chas, tangos, etc.), line dances, and rock 'n roll.\n\nGerman-American bands resist being termed \"polka bands\" because they perform not only polkas but also waltzes, schottisches, laendlers, and various other ethnic forms of music. Some of the Modern day German-American bands have even been known to incorporate Country & Western and/or Rock & Roll into their repertoire. They prefer the term \"old-time.\" Their style is also sometimes known as \"Dutchmen,\" a name derived from a band named The Six Fat Dutchmen. This is a contrast to Polish-American and Slovenian-American bands, which generally do not object to the term \"polka band\". German-American bands are also comparatively more traditional than the Slavic genres, with less modern American influence in their albums. Because of this, their recordings are much rarer and harder to come by than recordings of Slavic-style performers. The German-American sound is often described with the term \"oom-pa-pa\" and is characterized by an emphasis on brass (especially the tuba), accompanied by drums and reed instruments (including the accordion or concertina, although for the most part the concertina is usually favored over the accordion in German-American bands). German-American style bands perform primarily in the so-called \"polka belt\" of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. One important German-American performer is Lawrence Welk, who began his career as a band leader in South Dakota with an ethnic German-style ensemble called Welk's Novelty Orchestra. He later added more popular music to his band's repertoire, which enabled him to spread the polka throughout America by way of his famous television show. Other important modern German-American bands include the Hoolerie Dutchmen, the Jolly Swiss Boys, Happy Hans, and the Jerry Schneider Band.\n\nCzech-American style polka is similar to German-American style in many ways. Its performers call their bands \"old-time,\" use the same brass-heavy instrumentation, and are popular in the same \"polka belt.\" Czech-American bands tend to be even more traditional than German-American bands, playing numerous authentic Czech pieces (polkas, waltzes, and schottisches). Another unique aspect of many Czech bands is their family structure. Some Czech bands perpetuate a family structure through several generations. An example is the Masopust Polka Band, which was started by the Masopust family in the late nineteenth century and still plays today. Important Czech performers include the Harold Schultz Orchestra, the Greiner Brothers Orchestra, the Capital City Czech Choraliers of Nebraska, the Czechlanders Orchestra of Nebraska, Ernie Kucera, and Al Grebnik.\n\nNot as obviously related to the polka as the four genres above, Mexican-American polka is called \"conjunto\". The conjunto sound originated from the Czech and German influence on Mexican-Americans in Texas and northern Mexico. Conjunto bands play some polkas, but their most popular musical form is the \"ranchera,\" a form similar to polka. The instrumentation involves a combination of accordion, bajo sexto (a Mexican twelve-string guitar), bass, and drums. Important modern performers in the genre include Los Hermanos Bernal, Santiago Jimenez, Flaco Jimenez, Esteban Jordan, Valerio Longoria, and Tony De La Rosa among many others.\n\nPapago-Pima style is more commonly referred to as \"chicken scratch\" and is associated with the Native American Tohono O'odham tribe (who were once the Papago). This tribe was influenced by the music of the Germans who settled in southern Arizona, the most popular area for this genre. Papago-Pima performers use a saxophone, accordion, guitar, electric bass, and drums in their performances and commonly perform music that follows the form of the schottische (a dance with the same cultural origins as polka). The most important modern performers in this genre are Southern Scratch, the Joaquin Brothers, Papago Raiders, the Molinas, and T.O. Brave.\n\nWhile Keil's six genres cover the majority of polka performers, other polka bands combine these genres or exist outside of them altogether. Brave Combo is one important modern group that plays a combination of these three genres with a very modern edge. Started in 1979 by Carl Finch, this band is the ultimate in appealing to a wider, younger audience. In addition to accordion, tuba, woodwinds, drum, and trumpet, the instrumentation of the band includes guitar, electric horn, and harmonica. According to Finch, the genre of the band has \"no restrictions.\" They play everything from Polish-style to rancheras to Greek music.\n\nTo appeal to younger audiences, the band uses album covers that make the band look like a rock group and edgy album titles such as \"Kick Ass Polkas\". Their music is popular enough in the polka world that their 1999 album, \"Polkasonic\", won a Grammy in the polka category. Brave Combo is an example of the way some polka bands have tried to break free of the restrictions of genre and adapt to modern culture.\n\nFrom tiny ethnic dance halls to larger-scale national organizations, there is a huge network of people working to keep the polka alive. One Web site lists a total of 49 formal polka clubs nationwide, and there are many other smaller organizations . The largest organizations today include the International Polka Association (IPA), the United States Polka Association, the Polka Lovers Klub of America (Po.L.K. of A.), the Cleveland-Style Polka Hall of Fame, the Penn-Ohio Polka Pals, and the Wisconsin Polka Boosters. Modern communication has also allowed polka fans to organize through national newsletters such as the Polish-American Journal, and the Post Eagle. Polka news is even available online at Polonia Today. Radio stations have been organized to perpetuate the popularity of the polka. (although nowadays, most polka shows have been limited to airing on independent & time-brokered AM stations, small-market college FM stations, and a handful of Internet only polka stations.) One survey conducted in 1989 counted a total of 354 stations that played polka music in 32 states. (By September 2012, that number had dropped to 221 stations in 27 states.) Another triumph for the polka community came in 1985 when the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences formed a polka category so that polka artists could be recognized at the Grammy Awards ceremony.\n\nThe longest-standing and most influential polka organization by far is the Chicago-based International Polka Association (IPA). Beginning as an \"International Polka Convention\" in the mid-1960s, the IPA was officially established in 1968 with Leon Kozicki as the \"organization builder\" and John Hyzny as the \"entrepreneur\". According to its charter, its goals are \"to promote, maintain, and advance public interest in polka entertainment\". Today, the IPA still carries out yearly conventions every summer to allow polka fans to gather and to present the annual Polka Music Awards. The IPA established the Polka Music Hall of Fame in 1968 to honor worthy performers. In 1982, a building was established to house the Polka Music Hall of Fame and Museum.\n\nThroughout the United States (and especially through the so-called \"polka belt\"), polka fans gather to participate in polka festivals. Many of these festivals are arranged by organizations such as the IPA and the United States Polka Association. Others, such as Polish-style performer Eddie Blazoncyzk's \"Polka Fireworks\" festival in Pittsburgh, are run by polka stars or polka fans.\n\nThese festivals usually last several days and involve performances, dancing, jam sessions, beer, ethnic food, athletic events, parades, and polka masses. Though many festival attendees belong to an older generation, there are also a substantial number of young participants. Polka music and polka festivals are often described as \"happy\" and \"joyful\" by their organizers and participants. In their book Polka Happiness, Charles and Angeliki Keil describe the aspects of these \"polka parties\" that allow them to bring joy to people of all ages. A wide variety of people are accepted and people are encouraged to dance with many different partners. The musicians dance as well as perform. The live bands perform a variety of more modern music as well as traditional polkas. Participants drink enough to get \"silly or happy,\" but not enough to get drunk.\n\nThe Nebraska Czechs of Wilber (P.O. Box 652 Wilber, Nebraska 68465) have sponsored the annual Wilber Czech Days Festival since 1962. The Czech Festival includes music, dancing, museum, costumes, refreshments, a pageant and large parades on Saturday and Sunday of the festival. The Nebraska Czechs of Wilber organization was formed in 1962 to perpetuate the Czech heritage and culture, develop tourism and to boost the economy of Wilber. On July 17th, 1963, Wilber was proclaimed ‚ÄòCzech Capital of Nebraska.‚Äô On July 10th, 1987, Wilber was proclaimed, ‚ÄòCzech Capital of the U.S.A.‚Äô The festival is always held the first full weekend of August. http://www.nebraskaczechsofwilber.com/czech-days/\n\nOther Polka Festivals include, the United States Polka Association Convention, The Annual Minnesota State Polka Festival, Milwaukee Polish Fest, International Polka Association Convention, Pulaski Polka Days, New Glarus Polkafest, Wisconsin Dells Polish Fest, Frankenmuth Summer Music Fest, Oregon's Alpenfest Swiss-Bavarian festival, Polkamotion by the Ocean, Houghton Lake Polka Festival, SloveneFest, and Tony Petkovsek's Thanksgiving Polka Weekend.\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s, the phenomenon of \"polka masses\" began appearing. Polka masses are usually held by members of the Roman Catholic Church who consider the polka an important part of their ethnic heritages. The first polka mass was created by Father George Balasko in 1972 and the idea was spread by Father Frank Perkovich throughout the '70s and '80s. Both were polka musicians. In composing a polka mass, a musician either alters the lyrics of polka pieces to become more appropriate for a spiritual setting or creates an entirely new piece of polka-style music to sing with the usual sacred text. Robert Walser argues that the exuberant polka music motivates participants to \"worship more vigorously.\" He also asserts that the polka mass \"brings the community into the church\" because it involves music and lyrics that the congregations are more familiar with.\n\nPolka music is obviously associated with various ethnic groups throughout America. This is evident in the division of the polka genres into specific ethnic styles. Dr. Ann Hetzel Gunkel describes the polka as a means of protecting ethnic heritage from the invasion of \"American mass culture.\" She even argues that polka music can be perceived as a \"radical alternative\" to \"mainstream culture\". A good example of this is the polka mass. It allows entire communities to choose an alternate approach to worship that helps them preserve their ethnic origins. Another example of a resistance to mass culture is the status of polka stars. Popular polka performers are not viewed as sex symbols or idolized in the same way that pop stars of today are idolized. Instead, the performers work to establish a feeling of community by interacting and dancing with their audience. This expression of ethnicity is especially important as America continues to homogenize through media and the culture of capitalism. Sheltered communities that were once saturated with culture are forced to join modern American culture. Keeping the polka alive allows these communities to establish a tangible aspect of their culture that can be maintained amidst the changes American society faces.\n\nDr. Gunkel also asserts that the polka serves to resist not only American mass culture in general but also the loss of religion that exists in our society. The ethnic cultures associated with polka music are also associated with the Catholic Church. Lyrics used with polka music often reflect this association‚Äîmany contain references to God, the virgin Mary, and religion in general. The union of polka music with a religious experience in the polka mass is another example of the way polka music allows its participants to maintain their religion in a society that continues to disregard it. The effort to protect the polka is not merely an effort to perpetuate something that brings many people joy but is also an effort to preserve a threatened culture.\n\nCharles Keil describes the paradox that \"polka is a modern urban style that enables traditional cultures to persist\". Polka enthusiasts have to mediate between the desire to preserve their culture and the desire to keep the polka alive through future generations. This involves establishing a balance between traditionalism and modernism. An example of this conflict is the language polka music is performed in. Performers have to face the decision of performing and recording in Polish to appease those who prefer a more traditional approach and performing and recording in English to attract a wider, younger audience. English has become more and more popular, but many performers still learn several pieces with Polish lyrics. Another example of performer response to this conflict is the practice of performing and recording covers of popular non-polka music along with traditional polka music. The problem of attracting a broader audience while still preserving cultural heritage is an ongoing challenge in the polka world. The demographic for polka music in the USA currently consists primarily of married males between the ages of 60-85 with a median age of 74.\n\nThough many would agree with expert Richard March that the efforts of polka artists to reach a broader audience are \"doomed,\" the polka still has a strong base of enthusiastic supporters.\n\nThe future employment of polka artists is closely related to the future popularity of the polka dance.\n\nPotential limits to the popularity of the polka dance come from the relationship between footwear and the dance floor. The polka depends of a smooth dance surface, the most preferred dance venues once had sprung hardwood floors with a smooth finish. The most preferred footwear had leather soles, so dances could turn easily, and a rubber heel, so they could stop.\nThose floors are getting rare. Modern flooring can supply the smoothness. And modern footwear can ease the impact, just as the old floors did.\n\nMost styles of polka depend on low friction soles. Modern plastic soled footwear provides far greater traction that the leather soles common before the 1960s. A higher traction sole, during a turning polka, twists and stresses ankles, knees and hips more. Dancing more than a few polkas in running shoes can cause pain wherever legs are weakest, the knees of this typist. A common solution, for the enthusiast, is buying a pair of leather soled dancing shoes. But expecting beginners to spend about $100 for dance shoes, just to see if they like to polka or waltz, is an unreasonable strategy to hang the future of the polka on. And many dance shoes lack the cushion that the sprung floor used to provide.\n\nA very short term solution is to cover the soles, not the heels, of running shoes with knee high nylon stockings. It looks weird, but one pair of nylons can last through 5 or 6 dances or lessons. The nylon reduces the sole's friction with the floor while the running shoe cushions impact so smooth concrete becomes an acceptable dance surface. Leaving the shoe's heel exposed lets the dancer stop the turns in the same way the older footwear did. Recycling knee highs with runs for this use is perfect.\n\n"}

In this episode, a journalist becomes romantically involved with a dangerous, secretly centuries-old movie star.\n\nColumnist Jordan Herrick visits actress Pamela Morris, a woman known for her beauty and vitality, for an interview. In Pamela's manor he notices a painting of her that is dated 1940. Pamela still looks just as she did in the painting. When questioned on this, she says the painter drew her when she was a child with a projection of what she would look like as an adult, and deflects questions about her age. Pamela and Jordan flirt during the interview and make dinner plans for that night. As Jordan is leaving, an old woman who Pamela introduced as her mother, Mrs. Draper, warns him to never come back. Mrs. Draper says Pamela is many centuries old and that she is actually Pamela's daughter.\n\nDuring his date with Pamela, Jordan mentions what Mrs. Draper had said. Pamela claims Mrs. Draper is mentally ill, but after the date, Herrick calls his editor and asks him to research Pamela's first film, \"The Queen of the Nile\". The editor reveals that the film was a remake of a silent movie filmed on location in Egypt. Leading lady Constance Taylor was apparently killed in a cave-in near the end of the shooting. The editor compares photos of Constance and Pamela in the same role and says they look alike. Jordan asks the editor to dig up articles on every man Pamela has ever been involved with.\n\nJordan returns to the manor and confronts Pamela with his discovery. Pamela drugs Jordan's coffee and then places a scarab beetle on his unconscious body. The beetle drains his life until he has turned to dust. She then applies the scarab to her own chest.\n\nThe episode ends with another young and handsome columnist arriving to interview Pamela, starting the cycle once again. In the closing narration, it is hinted that Miss Morris is actually Cleopatra VII, and that she has lived for more than 2,000 years.\n\nApparently, in the original first-draft script, a handsome young policeman turns up at the end of the story, asking Pamela Morris as to the whereabouts of the now missing Jordan Herrick. She begins to flatter and flirt with the cop, setting him up to start the cycle all over again.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42488552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42488552", "title": "Sawlumin inscription", "text": "Sawlumin inscription\n\nThe Sawlumin inscription ( ) is one of the oldest surviving stone inscriptions in Myanmar. The slabs were mainly inscribed in Burmese, Pyu, Mon and Pali, and a few lines in Sanskrit. According to an early analysis, the stele was founded in 1079 by King Saw Lu of Pagan (Bagan).\n\nThree broken slabs of the inscription were discovered in Myittha Township, Mandalay Region on 17 November 2013 and a fourth piece was found on 27 November 2013. A fifth piece is still missing. The found four pieces were rejoined and currently stands in Petaw monastery. The slab size is in height, and in breadth.\n\nThe initial readings of the slabs threatened to upend the current understanding of Pagan-era dates. The initial reports claimed that the inscription was founded by King Saw Lu, and contained the year 415 ME (1053/54 CE), presumably as its inscription date. Moreover, the initial reports conjectured that the fifth script might be Tai-Yuan, Gon (Khun or Kengtung) Shan, over two centuries earlier than the earliest known evidence of a Tai-Shan script.\n\nHowever, at least one subsequent analysis does not agree with some of the initial readings. According to Bee Htaw Monzel, the slabs were indeed founded by Saw Lu and mainly inscribed in Burmese, Pyu, Mon and Pali, and a few lines of Sanskrit. His analysis finds that the Mon and Pyu versions state 441 as the year of inscription, and that the Pyu version also gives the 10th month and the 3rd day.\n\nBee Htaw Monzel's translation of the extant inscriptions can be summarized as:\n\nWhether the inscription was inscribed in 1079 CE (or 1052 as initially reported), the inscription, if the readings are confirmed, appears to be the earliest evidence of the Burma Mon script. (The currently accepted date of the earliest Burma Mon is 1093 CE.)\n\nFurthermore, the initial reading of 415 ME (25 March 1053 to 25 March 1054 CE) as the date of the inscription's foundation would have upended the current understanding of the early Pagan period.\n\n\n\n\nAs of April 2014, about 60 percent of the tablets had been deciphered. They have deciphered all of the Mon and Pali text and about 10 percent of Pyu. A copy of text in the Nagari writing system used in northern India and Nepal has been sent to the Archaeological Survey of India for deciphering. The Indian department replies that the inscription is not preserved in better condition. Some letters are peeled off and some are worn out. Only few letters in lines 6 and 7 are well preserved. The Indian department reveals that the inscription is engraved in early Nagari characters, retaining some of the features of Siddhamatrika or Kutila scripts.\n\nWhat has been translated so far describes the donation of a monastery, Maha Anuruda Deva Rama, by King Saw Lu and his wife Manicanda.\n\n"}
{"id": "35267248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35267248", "title": "Sexposition", "text": "Sexposition\n\nIn visual media such as television and film, sexposition is the technique of providing exposition against a backdrop of sex or nudity. The \"Financial Times\" defined sexposition as \"keeping viewers hooked by combining complex plot exposition with explicit sexual goings-on\". Its purpose, according to James Poniewozik, is to divert the audience and give characters something to do while exposition is being delivered, which is what distinguishes sexposition from merely gratuitous titillation.\n\nThe term was coined in 2011 by the blogger and critic Myles McNutt to describe scenes in the HBO TV series \"Game of Thrones\" in which characters reveal crucial information related to plot and character development during intimate scenes. Author George R. R. Martin said this technique is in line with the purpose of sexuality in the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" books, and acknowledged that this technique allows for the exposition of motivations and incentives not available to the TV show. The term \"sexposition\" has since been retroactively applied to similar practices in many earlier works, including the older HBO shows \"Deadwood\" and \"The Sopranos\" (frequently set in a strip club), many older cop films (likewise) and even the 1930s comic strip \"Jane\". According to critic Poniewozik, the novelty of the practice is not the nudity, but the manner in which it accompanies exposition, for which older TV shows with less complex plots did not have as much need.\n\nCritics have disapproved of sexposition because, in their view, it uses inappropriate tactics, insults the audience's intelligence by appealing and succumbing to carnality and covers up the screenwriter's failure to build cohesive narratives, having to rely on long drawn out sequences of exposition made watchable only through appeals to sexuality. Some criticize sexposition for catering almost exclusively to heterosexual men. Neil Marshall, director of the second-season episode \"Blackwater\", recalled that he was repeatedly urged to add more full-frontal nudity during filming. The producer told him, according to the director, that \"[e]veryone else in the series is drama side. I represent the pervy side of the audience\", an experience that Marshall described as \"pretty surreal\" to happen on the set of a major network production.\n\n\"Game of Thrones\" showrunner David Benioff admitted that he does \"pay less attention to intricate plot points delivered during sex scenes\", while co-creator D. B. Weiss disagreed, countering that \"Sex grabs people's attention. But once it has their attention, it tends not to let go of it.\" While the effect is reportedly different for different directors, they say \"Every one of those sex scenes is there because we wanted that particular scene in the show. There is not a sex scene quota from HBO.\" \"Time\" reported before the seventh season in 2017 that \"Even if Benioff and Weiss don‚Äôt always admit it, the show has changed. Scenes in which exposition is delivered in one brothel or another, for example, have been pared back\".\n\nFan site Winter is Coming cited an April 2012 skit on \"Saturday Night Live\" when discussing Marshall's anecdote. Aired more than a month before the Marshall interview was published, the skit purported to be an episode of \"HBO First Look\" featuring Adam Friedberg, 13 year-old \"creative consultant\" to \"Game of Thrones\". Played by Andy Samberg, the teenage boy was proud of \"mak[ing] sure there are lots of boobs\" and various sexual acts during expository scenes. Author Martin (Bobby Moynihan) called Friedberg \"a visionary. He knows that even when I didn't write sex into a scene, I was definitely thinking about it.\" The real Martin is aware of the skit, joking at San Diego Comic-Con that Friedberg could not attend because \"[t]here was a scene in Belfast with no boobies in it and he needed to go there to put that to rights\".\n"}
{"id": "447495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=447495", "title": "Sinulog", "text": "Sinulog\n\nThe Sinulog-Santo Ni√±o Festival is an annual cultural and religious festival held on the third Sunday of January in Cebu City, and is the centre of the Santo Ni√±o Catholic celebrations in the Philippines.\n\nThe festival is considered to be first of most popular festivals in the Philippines, with every celebration of the festival routinely attracting around 1 to 2 million people from all over the Philippines every year. Aside from the religious aspect of the festival, Sinulog is also famous for its street parties, usually happening the night before and the night of the main festival.\n\nOther places like Kabankalan City, Maasin City, Balingasag Misamis Oriental, Cagayan de Oro City, Butuan City and Pagadian City also have their own version of the festival in honor of Santo Ni√±o.\n\nThe word \"Sinulog\" comes from the Cebuano adverb \"sulog\" which roughly means \"like water current movement;\" it describes the forward-backward movement of the Sinulog dance. The dance consists of two steps forward and one step backward, done to the sound of drums. The dance is categorized into Sinulog-base, Free-Interpretation, and street dancing. Candle vendors at the Basilica continue to perform the traditional version of the dance when lighting a candle for the customer, usually accompanied by songs in the native language.\n\nSinulog is the ritual prayer-dance honoring Se√±or Santo Ni√±o or the Child Jesus. An image of the Child Jesus is said to be the baptismal gift the Portuguese conquistador Ferdinand Magellan gave Hara Amihan (Humanay) of Zebu (now Cebu) in April 1521. The image, believed to be miraculous, is housed at the Basilica Minore del Santo Ni√±o in downtown Cebu City.\n\nThe Sinulog dance moves are basically two steps forward and one step backward as the dancer sways to a distinct rhythm of drums. This movement resembles the current (Sulog) of what was known as Cebu‚Äôs Pahina River.\n\nAccording to historical accounts, the Cebu natives already danced the Sinulog in honor of their animist idols long before the arrival of Magellan who led a Spanish expedition on April 7, 1521. Magellan did not live long after he introduced Christianity. He died in a failed assault on nearby Mactan island at the hands of a local chieftain named Lapu-Lapu.\n\nSurvivors of Magellan's expedition left behind the image to be discovered 44 years later.\n\nThe expedition led by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi bombarded the native settlement when they arrived on April 28, 1565. In one of the burning huts, one of Legazpi's men, Juan Camus, discovered the image of the Santo Ni√±o inside a wooden box beside other idols. This time however, Legazpi discovered that the natives already dance the Sinulog honoring the Santo Ni√±o.\n\nToday the Sinulog commemorates the Filipino people's acceptance of Christianity (specifically, Roman Catholicism), and their rejection of their former animist beliefs. The first of these conversions happened in 1521 on the island of Cebu, when Rajah Humabon and his queen Amihan (Humamay) were baptized along with their subjects, becoming Carlos and Juana of Cebu.\n\nOn March 16, 1521, the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan arrived and planted the cross on the shores of Cebu, claiming the territory for Spain. He presented the image of the Child Jesus to the Rajah, Humabon. Hara Humamay (or Amihan in some versions) was later named, Queen Juana in honor of Juana, mother of Carlos I. Along with the rulers of the island, some 800 natives were also baptized to the Roman Catholic Church. At the moment of receiving the holy image, it was said that Queen Juana danced with joy bearing this image of the child Jesus. With the other natives following her example, this moment was regarded as the first Sinulog.\n\nThis event is frequently used as basis for most Sinulog dances, which dramatize the coming of the Spaniards and the presentation of the Santo Ni√±o to the Queen. A popular theme among Sinulog dances is Queen Juana holding the Santo Ni√±o in her arms and using it to bless her people who were often afflicted with sickness believed to be caused by demons and other evil spirits.\n\nThe Sinulog dance steps are believed to originate from Rajah Humabon's adviser, Baladhay. It was during Humabon's grief when Baladhay fell sick. Humabon ordered his native tribe to bring Baladhay into a room where the Santo Ni√±o was enthroned, along with the other pagan gods of the native Cebuanos. After a few days passed, Baladhay was heard shouting and was found dancing with utmost alertness. Baladhay was questioned as to why was he was awake and shouting. Pointing to the image of the Santo Ni√±o, Baladhay explained that he had found on top of him a small child trying to wake him and tickling him with the midrib of the coconut. Greatly astonished, he scared the child away by shouting. The little child got up and started making fun of Baladhay. In turn, Baladhay danced with the little child and explained that he was dancing the \"movements of the river.\" To this day, the two-steps forward, one-step backward movement is still used by Santo Ni√±o devotees who believe that it was the Santo Ni√±o's choice to have Baladhay dance.\n\nThe Augustinian friars that accompanied L√≥pez de Legazpi in his expedition proclaimed the statue performed miracles and built a church on the site where it was found. The church was called San Agustin Church, later renamed to Basilica Minore del Santo Ni√±o.\n\nAfter Juan Camus found the Santo Ni√±o in the burning village, L√≥pez de Legazpi was said to have included the incident in his report, entitled \"Relation of Voyage to the Philippine Islands\":\n\nSince the 16th century, there is great devotion to the Santo Ni√±o in Philippine popular piety, particularly in the Visayas. Pilgrims from different parts of Cebu and the rest of the Philippines make their yearly journey to the church to take part in the procession and festival. Starting in 1980, the Cebu City government organized the Sinulog Festival and eventually gave incentives also to tribal dance groups. The first Sinulog parade was held in 1980, organized by D√°vid Odilao, then Regional Director of the Ministry of Sports, and Youth Development. The parade was composed of students dressed in Knitted Filipiniana costumes, dancing the Sinulog to the beating of drums.\n\nThe idea caught and thus, under the direction of the Cebu City Mayor Florentino Solon with the help of several influential Cebuanos, Odilao turned over the Sinulog project to the Cebu City Historical Committee under Kagawad Jesus Garcia. It was the task of the Committee to conceptualize the Sinulog festival and make it into a yearly event from then on.\n\nIn 1981 the following year, the concept of the Sinulog Parade was actualized involving not just Cebu but also representatives from other provinces in the Philippines . Marking its difference from another popular festival, the Ati-Atihan in Aklan, the Sinulog focuses not on the ritual itself but on the historical aspects of the dance, which, as it has been said, represents the link the country's embrace of Christian faith.\n\n2010-2014 Peace and Order during Sinulog celebration was an issue for years. Gangs and fraternity wars were rampant during night times. The organization of AITF under the leadership of PCI Franz Georsua became the key to a peaceful and more meaningful celebration after controlling most of the street crimes during the said event.\n\nThe Cebu City Historical Committee, which was responsible for the conceptualization of the Sinulog as a provincial event, decided to adopt a logo for the Sinulog to identify it as an institutionalized yearly event. They turned to the coat of arms of the Santo Ni√±o which consisted of a two-headed hawk that was the mark of the ruling House of Habsburg in Europe. The emblem represented the twin purpose of the Habsburg dynasty as \"Champion of Catholicism and Defender of the Faith.\" At the time when Spain sent expeditions to the Philippines, they were under the Habsburg dynasty. The committee viewed that using the image of the Santo Ni√±o as part of the symbol as sacrilege.\n\nThe Sinulog committee then incorporated the two-headed eagle to a native warrior's shield. The native shield is supposed to symbolize the Philippines resistance to colonization while the Santo Ni√±o's coat of arms printed on its face represented the country's acceptance of Roman Catholicism.\n\n"}

{"id": "11951133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11951133", "title": "The Fire Thief (novel)", "text": "The Fire Thief (novel)\n\nThe Fire Thief was written by Terry Deary and is the first book in The Fire Thief Trilogy. The book is about Prometheus, the Greek Titan who, in Greek mythology, is said to have stolen fire from the gods and given it to humans.\n\nThe story tells of Prometheus when he is chained to a rock and about to have his liver ripped out by the Fury, but instead he is freed by the hero Hercules. He grabs the Fury, breaks its neck and runs away after he has been freed from the mountain he was chained to, by his cousin Zeus, the Greek god of lightning and ruler of the sky. Zeus sends him on a quest to find a true human hero. He gives Prometheus a ring because he promised that Prometheus will always be chained to that rock. This means that Zeus can always find him as well. Prometheus travels into the future with a pair of magical wings. He lands in Eden City and is helped by Uncle Edward and young Jim, a pair of robbers. The Fury is bent on revenge and Theus must complete this task while avoiding the Fury, who is supposed to eat his liver everyday for eternity. There, Jim and Uncle Edward stay at Storm Inn where they meet January Storm. They came to Eden City to steal riches from the Mucklethrift Manor. They usually put a play on and while they are doing it, Jim goes and steals the riches. When Prometheus came, he was strong so he could help the robbers carry the coffin which they put the stolen goods in. They are successful but Mayor Walter Tweed catches them and demands to get 1/3 of the stolen riches. The Mayor makes a fake deal with the Uncle Edward pretending that the police would not catch the robbers, Uncle Edward and Jim.\n\nThe other two books in the series are \"Flight of the Fire Thief\" (2006) and \"The Fire Thief Fights Back\" (2007).\n\nA famous rhyme in the Fire Thief book is chanted by imaginary mythological character in the book:\n\n\"The boy stood on the burning deck, picking his nose like crazy. He rolled them into little balls, and flicked them 'till he felt hazy!\"\n\nThe rhyme is used by the creatures as a joke to taunt Jim.\n"}
{"id": "759793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=759793", "title": "The Golden Ass", "text": "The Golden Ass\n\nThe Metamorphoses of Apuleius, which St. Augustine referred to as The Golden Ass (\"Asinus aureus\"), is the only ancient Roman novel in Latin to survive in its entirety.\n\nThe protagonist of the novel is called Lucius. At the end of the novel, he is revealed to be from Madaurus, the hometown of Apuleius himself. The plot revolves around the protagonist's curiosity (\"curiositas\") and insatiable desire to see and practice magic. While trying to perform a spell to transform into a bird, he is accidentally transformed into an ass. This leads to a long journey, literal and metaphorical, filled with inset tales. He finally finds salvation through the intervention of the goddess Isis, whose cult he joins.\n\nThe date of composition of the \"Metamorphoses\" is uncertain. It has variously been considered by scholars as a youthful work preceding Apuleius' \"Apology\" of 158/9 AD, or as the climax of his literary career and perhaps as late as the 170s or 180s. Apuleius adapted the story from a Greek original of which the author's name is said to be Lucius of Patrae (the name of the lead character and narrator). This Greek text has been lost, but there is ŒõŒøœçŒ∫ŒπŒøœÇ ·º¢ ·ΩÑŒΩŒøœÇ (\"Lo√∫kios √® √≥nos\", \"Loukios/Lucius\" or \"The Ass\"), a similar tale of disputed authorship, traditionally attributed to Lucian of Samosata, a contemporary of Apuleius. This surviving Greek text appears to be an abridgement or epitome of \"Lucius of Patrae's\" text. Possibly the original lost story was written by Lucian and the abridged version was later transmitted under his name.\n\nBook One\n\nThe prologue establishes an audience and a speaker, who defines himself by location, education, and occupation. The narrator journeys to Thessaly on business. On the way, he runs into Aristomenes and an unnamed traveler. The unnamed traveler refuses to believe Aristomenes' story. The narrator scolds the unnamed traveler and tells a short story about a sword swallower. He promises Aristomenes a free lunch if he will retell his tale. The narrator believes Aristomenes' tale and becomes more eager to learn about magic. The narrator arrives at Hypata, where he stays with Milo, a family friend and miser, and his wife Pamphile. Photis, Milo's servant, takes the narrator to the baths, after which the narrator goes to the marketplace. There, he buys some fish and runs into his old friend Pytheas, who is now a magistrate. Pytheas reveals the narrator's name as Lucius. Pytheas says that Lucius overpaid for the fish and humiliates the fish-monger by trampling on the fish. Lucius returns to Milo's house, hungry and empty-handed. Milo asks Lucius about his life, his friends, and his wanderings. Lucius goes to sleep hungry.\n\nBook Two\n\nThe next morning, Lucius meets his aunt Byrrhena in the town, and she warns him that Milo's wife is an evil witch who will kill Lucius. Lucius, however, is interested in becoming a witch himself. He then returns to Milo's house, where he repeatedly makes love to the slave-girl Fotis (also spelled Photis). The next day, Lucius goes to his aunt's home for dinner, and there meets Thelyphron, who relates his tale of how witches cut off his nose and ears. After the meal, Lucius drunkenly returns to Milo's house in the dark, where he encounters three robbers, whom he soon slays before retiring to bed.\n\nBook Three\n\nThe next morning, Lucius is abruptly awoken and arrested for the murder of the three men. He is taken to court where he is laughed at constantly and witnesses are brought against him. They are just about to announce his guilt when the widow demands to bring out the dead bodies; but when the three bodies of the murdered men are revealed, they turn out to be puffed-up wineskins. It then turns out that it was a prank played by the town upon Lucius, to celebrate their annual Festival of Laughter. Later that day, Lucius and Photis watch Milo's wife perform her witchcraft and transform herself into a bird. Attempting to copy her, Lucius accidentally turns himself into an ass, at which point Photis tells him that the only way for him to return to his human state is to eat a rose. She puts him in the stable for the night and promises to bring him roses in the morning, but during the night Milo's house is raided by a band of thieves, who steal Lucius the ass, load him up with their plunder, and leave with him.\n\nBook Four\n\nOn a break in his journey with the bandits, Lucius the ass trots over to a garden to munch on what seem to be roses (but are actually poisonous rose-laurels) when he is beaten by the gardener and chased by dogs. The thieves reclaim him and he is forced to go along with them; they talk about how their leader Thrasileon has been killed while dressed as a bear. The thieves then kidnap a young woman, Charite, who is housed in a cave with Lucius the ass. Charite starts crying, so an elderly woman who is in league with the thieves begins to tell her the story of Cupid and Psyche.\n\nPsyche is the most beautiful woman on earth, and Venus jealously arranges for Psyche's destruction, ordering her son Cupid to arrange for her to fall in love with a worthless wretch. An oracle tells Psyche's parents to expose her on a mountain peak, where she will become the bride of a powerful, monstrous being. Psyche is left on the mountain, and carried away by a gentle wind.\n\nBook Five\n\nThe elderly woman continues telling the story of Cupid and Psyche. Cupid, Venus's son, secretly preserves Psyche; Cupid becomes Psyche's mysterious husband, who is invisible to her by day and only visits her at night. Psyche's jealous sisters arouse her curiosity and fear about her husband's identity; Psyche, against Cupid's commands, looks at him by lamplight at night; Cupid abandons Psyche, who wanders in search of him, and takes revenge on her wicked sisters.\n\nBook Six\n\nThe elderly woman finishes telling the story of Cupid and Psyche, as Psyche is forced to perform various tasks for Venus (including an errand to the underworld) with the help of Cupid and an assortment of friendly creatures, and is finally reunited with her husband. Lucius the ass and Charite escape from the cave but they are caught by the thieves, and sentenced to death.\nBook Seven\n\nA man appears to the thieves and announces that he is the renowned thief Haemus the Thracian, who suggests that they should not kill the captives but sell them. Haemus later reveals himself secretly to Charite as her fianc√© Tlepolemus, and gets all of the thieves drunk. When they are asleep he slays them all. Tlepolemus, Charite and Lucius the ass safely escape back to the town. Once there, the ass is entrusted to a horrid boy who torments him but the boy is later killed by a she-bear. Enraged, the boy's mother plans to kill the ass.\n\nBook Eight\n\nA man arrives at the mother's house and announces that Tlepolemus and Charite are dead, caused by the scheming of the evil Thrasillus who wants Charite to marry him. After hearing the news of their master's death, the slaves run away, taking the ass Lucius with them. The large group of travelling slaves is mistaken for a band of robbers and attacked by farmhands of a rich estate. Several other misfortunes befall the travelers until they reach a village. Lucius as the narrator often digresses from the plot in order to recount several scandal-filled stories that he learns of during his journey. Lucius is eventually sold to a catamite priest. He is entrusted with carrying the statue of a goddess on his back while he follows around the group of sinful priests. While engaging in lewd activity with a local boy, the group of priests is discovered by a man in search of a stolen ass who mistakes Lucius' braying for that of his own animal. The priests flee to a new city where they are well received by one of its chief citizens. They are preparing to dine when his cook realizes that the meat that was to be served was stolen by a dog. The cook, at the suggestion of his wife, prepares to kill Lucius in order to serve his meat instead.\nBook Nine\n\nLucius' untimely escape from the cook coincides with an attack by rabid dogs, and his wild behavior is attributed to their viral bites. The men barricade him in a room until it is decided that he is no longer infected. The band of priests packs up and moves out. The narrative is interrupted by The Tale of the Wife's Tub. After the arrest of the priests Lucius is sold into labor, driving a baker's mill-wheel. Lucius, though bemoaning his labor as an ass, also realizes that this state has allowed him to hear many novel things with his long ass-ears. The Tale of the Jealous Husband and The Tale of the Fuller's Wife mark a break in the narrative. The theme of the two intervening stories is adultery, and the text appropriately follows with the adultery of the baker's wife and the subsequent murder of the baker. Lucius the ass is then auctioned off to a farmer. The Tale of the Oppressive Landlord is here told. The farmer duly assaults a legionary who makes advances on his ass (Lucius), but he is found out and jailed.\n\nBook Ten\n\nLucius comes into the legionary's possession, and after lodging with a decurion Lucius recounts Tale of the Murderous Wife. He is then sold to two brothers, a confectioner and a cook, who treated him kindly. When they go out Lucius secretly eats his fill of their food. At first a source of vexation, when the ass was discovered to be the one behind the disappearing food it was much laughed at and celebrated. Again he was sold, and he was taught many amusing tricks. Rumor spread, and great fame came to the ass and his master. As it happened, a woman was so enamored of the sideshow ass that she paid off his keeper and took him to bed with her. The Tale of the Jealous Wife is aired. The murderess depicted in this tale is precisely she whom Lucius is made to mate with at the Shows. After an enactment of the judgment of Paris and a brief but important digression, the time comes for Lucius to make his much awaited appearance. At the last moment he decides against this, fearing for his life, and he runs away to Cenchreae eventually to nap on the beach.\n\nBook Eleven\n\nLucius wakes up in a panic during the first watch of the night. Considering Fate to be done tormenting him, he takes the opportunity to purify himself by seven consecutive immersions in the sea. He then offers a prayer to the Queen of Heaven, for his return to human form, citing all the various names the goddess is known by to people everywhere (Venus, Ceres, Paphos, Proserpine, etc.). The Queen of Heaven appears in a vision to him and explains to him how he can be returned to human form by eating the crown of roses that will be held by one of her priests during a religious procession the following day. In return for his redemption, Lucius is expected to be initiated through the \"Navigium Isidis\" into Isis' priesthood (Isis being the Queen of Heaven's true name, according to her). Lucius follows her instructions and is returned to human form and, at length, initiated into her priesthood. Lucius is then sent to his ancestral home, Rome, where he continues to worship Isis, under the local name, Campensis. After a time, he is visited once more by the goddess who speaks again of mysteries and holy rites which Lucius comes to understand as a command to be initiated into the cult of Isis. He does so. Shortly afterwards, he receives a third vision. Though he is confused, the god appears to him and reassures him that he is much blessed and that he is to become once more initiated that he might supplicate in Rome as well. The story concludes with the goddess, Isis, appearing to Lucius and declaring that Lucius shall rise to a prominent position in the legal profession and that he shall be appointed to the College of Pastophori that he might serve Osiris and Isis' mysteries. Lucius is so happy that he goes about freely exposing his bald head.\n\nSimilar to other picaresque novels, \"The Golden Ass\" features several shorter stories told by characters encountered by the protagonist. Some act as independent short stories, while others interlock with the original novel's plot developments.\n\nAt the beginning of Book One, Lucius encounters two men arguing on the road about the truth of one's story. Lucius is interested, and offers the teller a free lunch for his tale.\n\nAristomenes goes on business for cheese and he runs into his friend Socrates, who is disheveled and emaciated. Aristomenes clothes Socrates and takes him to the bathhouse. Aristomenes berates Socrates for leaving his family. While they're eating lunch, Socrates tells about his affair with Mero√´. Socrates tells Aristomenes that Mero√´ is an ugly witch who turns her ex-lovers into rather unfortunate animals. Aristomenes doesn't believe Socrates' tale but is nevertheless afraid. Aristomenes barricades the door and they both go to bed. In the middle of the night, Mero√´ and Panthia break in, cut open Socrates, drain his blood, rip out his heart, and replace it with a sponge. Before leaving, they urinate on Aristomenes. The witches spare Aristomenes because they want him to bury Socrates in the land. Aristomenes fears that he will be blamed for the death of his friend and attempts to hang himself, but is comically stopped when the rope is revealed to be too rotten to support his weight. In the morning, Socrates wakes up and everything seems to be normal. They continue travelling and reach a stream, where Socrates bends to take a drink, which causes the sponge to fall out and him to die. Aristomenes buries Socrates in the ground, and then proceeds on his way.\n\nIn Book Two, Thelyphron hesitantly relates a story requested at a dinner party that was previously popular with his friends:\n\nWhile a University student, Thelyphron partakes in many wanderings and eventually runs out of funds. At Larissa, he encounters a large sum being offered to watch over a corpse for the night. When he asks, a citizen tells him that shape-shifting witches are quite common in the area, using pieces of human flesh to fuel incantations. Thelyphron takes the job for a thousand drachme and is warned to stay very alert all through the night. The widow is at first hesitant, taking inventory of the body's intact parts. Thelyphron requests a meal and some wine, to which she promptly refuses and leaves him with a lamp for the night. A¬†weasel enters the room and Thelyphron quickly chases it out, then falls into a deep sleep. At dawn, Thelyphron awakes and to his relief finds the body intact. The widow enters, and calls for Thelyphron to be paid, satisfied with the intact corpse. Thanking the widow, Thelyphron is suddenly attacked by the crowd and narrowly escapes. He witnesses an elder of the town approach the townspeople and claim that the widow had poisoned her husband to cover up a love affair. The widow protests, and a necromancer is called to bring back the deceased for the only truly reliable testimony. The corpse awakes, and affirms the widow's guilt. The corpse does thank Thelyphron for his trouble; during the night the witches entered as small animals, putting Thelyphron to sleep and stealing pieces of his ears and nose. The witches cleverly replace the missing flesh with wax to delay discovery. Thelyphron touches his nose and ears to find wax fall out of where they once were. The crowd laughs at Thelyphron's humiliation.\n\nIn Book Four, an elderly woman tells the story to comfort the bandits' captives. The story is continued through Books Five and Six.\n\nPsyche, the most beautiful woman in the world is envied by her family as well as by Venus. An oracle of Venus demands she be sent to a mountaintop and wed to a murderous beast. Sent by Venus to destroy her, Cupid falls in love and flies her away to his castle. There she is directed to never seek to see the face of her husband, who visits and makes love to her in the dark of night. Eventually, Psyche wishes to see her sisters, who jealously demand she seek to discover the identity of her husband. That night, Psyche discovers her husband is Cupid while he is sleeping, but wakes and scars him with her candle. Infuriated, he flies to heaven and leaves her banished from her castle. In attempted atonement, Psyche seeks the temple of Venus and offers herself as a slave. Venus assigns Psyche four impossible tasks. First, she is commanded to sort through a great hill of mixed grains. In pity, many ants aid her in completing the task. Next, she is commanded to retrieve wool of the dangerous golden sheep. A¬†river god aids Psyche and tells her to gather clumps of wool from thorn bushes nearby. Venus next requests water from a cleft high beyond mortal reach. An eagle gathers the water for Psyche. Next, Psyche is demanded to seek some beauty from Proserpina, Queen of the Underworld. Attempting to kill herself to reach the underworld, Psyche ascends a great tower and prepares to throw herself down. The tower speaks, and teaches Psyche the way of the underworld. Psyche retrieves the beauty in a box, and, hoping to gain the approval of her husband, opens the box to use a little. She is put into a coma. Cupid rescues her, and begs Jupiter that she may become immortal. Psyche is granted Ambrosia, and the two are forever united.\n\nThe story is the best-known of those in \"The Golden Ass\" and frequently appears in or is referred to directly in later literature.\n\nIn the course of a visit to an inn in Book Nine, a smith recounts an anecdote concerning his wife's deceit:\n\nDuring the day, her husband absent at his labors, the smith's wife is engaged in an adulterous affair. One day, however, the smith, work finished well ahead of schedule, returns home prematurely¬†‚Äî obviously to his wife's great consternation. Panicked, the faithless woman hides her lover in an old tub. After absorbing his spouse's efforts at distraction, which take the form of bitter reproaches that his coming back so early betokens a laziness that can only worsen their poverty, the smith announces that he has sold the tub for six drachmae; to this his wife responds by saying that she has in fact already sold it for seven, and has sent the buyer into the tub to inspect it. Emerging, the lover complains that his supposed purchase is in need of a proper scrubbing if he is to close the deal, so the cuckolded smith gets a candle and flips the tub to clean it from underneath. The canny adulteress then lies atop of the tub and, her lover pleasuring her the while, instructs her hapless husband as to where he should apply his energies. To add insult to injury, the ill-used man eventually has to deliver the tub to the lover's house himself.\n\nIn Book Nine, a baker's wife of poor reputation is advised by a female 'confidant' to be wary of choosing her lover, suggesting she find one very strong of body and will. She relates the story of one of the wife's previous school friends:\n\nBarbarus, an overbearing husband, is forced leave on a business trip, and commands his slave, Myrmex, to watch his wife, Aret√´, closely to assure she is being faithful during his time away. Barbarus tells Myrmex that any failure will result in his death. Myrmex is so intimidated that he does not let Aret√´ out of his sight. Aret√´'s looks, however, charm Philesietaerus who vows to go to any lengths to gain her love. Philesietaerus bribes Myrmex with thirty gold pieces and the promise of his protection for allowing him a night with Aret√´. Becoming obsessed with gold, Myrmex delivers the message to Aret√´ and Philesietaerus pays Myrmex a further ten pieces. While Aret√´ and Philesietaerus are making love, Barbarus returns but is locked out of the house. Philesietaerus leaves in a hurry, leaving behind his shoes. Barbarus does not notice the strange shoes until the morning, at which point he chains Myrmex's hands and drags him through town, screaming, while looking for the shoes' owner. Philesietaerus spots the two, runs up, and with great confidence shouts at Myrmex, accusing him of stealing his shoes. Barbarus allows Myrmex to live, but beats him for the 'theft'.\n\nIn Book Nine the baker's wife attempts to hide her lover from her husband, and entertains to her husband's story of the Fuller:\n\nWhile coming home with the Baker for supper, the Fuller interrupts his wife's love-making with a lover. She frantically attempts to hide her lover in a drying cage in the ceiling, hidden by hanging clothes soaked in sulphur. The lover begins to sneeze, and at first the Fuller excuses his wife. After a few sneezes, the Fuller gets up and turns over the cage to find the lover waiting. The Fuller is talked out of beating the young man to death by the Baker, who points out that the young man will shortly die from the sulphur fumes if left in the cage. The Fuller agrees and returns the lover to the cage.\n\nThe tale is used to contrast the earlier tale told to the Baker's wife of high suspicion and quick judgments of character by her 'auntie' with the overly naive descriptions of nefarious people by her husband.\n\nIn Book Ten a woman condemned to public humiliation with Lucius tells him her crimes:\n\nA man goes on a journey, leaving his pregnant wife and infant son. He commands his wife that if she bears a daughter, the child is to be killed. The child is indeed a daughter, and in pity, the mother convinces her poor neighbours to raise her. Her daughter grows up ignorant of her origin, and when she reaches a marriageable age, the mother tells her son to deliver her daughter's dowry. The son begins preparation to marry the girl off to a friend, and lets her into his home under the guise of her being an orphan to all but the two of them. His wife, however, is unaware the girl is his sister, and believes he keeps her as a mistress. His wife steals her husband's signet ring and visits their country home accompanied by a group of slaves. She sends a slave with the signet to fetch the girl and bring her to the country home. The girl, aware that the husband is her brother, responds immediately, and on arrival at the country home is flogged by the wife's slaves, and put to death by a torch placed 'between her thighs'. The girl's brother takes the news and falls gravely ill. Aware of suspicions around her, his wife asks a corrupt doctor for instant poison. Accompanied by the doctor, she brings the poison to her husband in bed. Finding him surrounded by friends, she first tricks the doctor into drinking from the cup to prove to her husband the drink is benign, and giving him the remainder. Unable to return home in time to seek an antidote, the doctor dies telling his wife what happened and to at least collect a payment for the poison. The doctor's widow asks for payment but first offers the wife the remainder of her husband's collection of poisons. Finding that her daughter is next of kin to her husband for inheritance, the wife prepares a poison for both the doctor's widow and her daughter. The doctor's widow recognizes early the symptoms of the poison and rushes to the Governor's Home. She tells the Governor the whole of the connected murders and dies. The wife is sentenced to death by wild beasts and to have public intercourse with Lucius the ass.\n\nThe text is a precursor to the literary genre of the episodic picaresque novel, in which Quevedo, Rabelais, Boccaccio, Cervantes, Voltaire, Defoe and many others have followed. It is an imaginative, irreverent, and amusing work that relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, a virile young man who is obsessed with magic. Finding himself in Thessaly, the \"birthplace of magic,\" Lucius eagerly seeks an opportunity to see magic being used. His overenthusiasm leads to his accidental transformation into an ass. In this guise, Lucius, a member of the Roman country aristocracy, is forced to witness and share the miseries of slaves and destitute freemen who are reduced, like Lucius, to being little more than beasts of burden by their exploitation at the hands of wealthy landowners.\n\n\"The Golden Ass\" is the only surviving work of literature from the ancient Greco-Roman world to examine, from a first-hand perspective, the abhorrent condition of the lower classes. Yet despite its serious subject matter, the novel remains imaginative, witty, and often sexually explicit. Numerous amusing stories, many of which seem to be based on actual folk tales, with their ordinary themes of simple-minded husbands, adulterous wives, and clever lovers, as well as the magical transformations that characterize the entire novel, are included within the main narrative. The longest of these inclusions is the tale of Cupid and Psyche, encountered here for the first but not the last time in Western literature.\n\nApuleius' style is innovative, mannered, baroque and exuberant, a far cry from the more sedate Latinity familiar from the schoolroom. In the introduction to his translation of \"The Golden Ass\", Jack Lindsay writes:\n\nLindsay's own version is: \"She was lewd and crude, a toper and a groper, a nagging hag of a fool of a mule.\"\n\nSarah Ruden's recent translation is: \"A fiend in a fight but not very bright, hot for a crotch, wine-botched, rather die than let a whim pass by ‚Äì that was her.\"\nApuleius' vocabulary is often eccentric and includes some archaic words. However, S. J. Harrison argues that some archaisms of syntax in the transmitted text may be the result of textual corruption.\n\nIn the last book, the tone abruptly changes. Driven to desperation by his asinine form, Lucius calls for divine aid, and is answered by the goddess Isis. Eager to be initiated into the mystery cult of Isis, Lucius abstains from forbidden foods, bathes and purifies himself. Then the secrets of the cult's books are explained to him and further secrets revealed, before going through the process of initiation which involves a trial by the elements in a journey to the underworld. Lucius is then asked to seek initiation into the cult of Osiris in Rome, and eventually becomes initiated into the \"pastophoroi\", a group of priests that serves Isis and Osiris.\n\nThe style of autobiographical confession of suffering in \"The Golden Ass\" influenced Augustine of Hippo in the tone and style‚Äîpartly in Polemic‚Äîof his \"Confessions\". Scholars note that Apuleius came from the M'Daourouch in Algeria, where Augustine would later study. Augustine refers to Apuleius and \"The Golden Ass\" particularly derisively in \"City of God\".\n\nIn 1517, Niccol√≤ Machiavelli wrote his own version of the story, as a terza rima poem. It was uncompleted at the time of his death.\n\nIn 1708, Charles Gildon published an adaptation of \"The Golden Ass\", titled \"The New Metamorphosis\". A year later in 1709, he published a re-adaptation, titled \"The Golden Spy\", which is regarded as the first, fully-fledged it-narrative in English.\n\nIn 1821, Charles Nodier published \"Smarra ou les Demons de la Nuit\" influenced by a lecture of Apuleius.\n\nIn 1883, Carlo Collodi published \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" which includes an episode in which the puppet protagonist is transformed into an ass. Another character who is transformed alongside him is named Lucignolo (Candlewick or Lampwick), a possible allusion to Lucius. The episode is frequently featured in its subsequent adaptations.\n\nIn 1915, Franz Kafka published the short story \"The Metamorphosis\" under a quite similar name, about a young man's unexpected transformation into an \"Ungeziefer\", a verminous bug.\n\nIn 1956, C. S. Lewis published the allegorical novel, \"Till We Have Faces\", retelling the Cupid‚ÄìPsyche myth of books four through six from the point of view of Orual, Psyche's jealous ugly sister. The novel revolves upon the threat and hope of meeting the divine face to face. It has been called Lewis's \"most compelling and powerful novel\".\n\nIn 1985, comic-book artist Georges Pichard adapted the text into a graphic novel titled \"Les Sorci√®res de Thessalie\".\n\nIn April 1999, the Canadian Opera Company produced an operatic version of \"The Golden Ass\" by Randolph Peters, the libretto of which was written by celebrated Canadian author Robertson Davies. An operatic production of \"The Golden Ass\" also appears as a plot device in Davies's novel \"A¬†Mixture of Frailties\" (1958).\n\nIn 1999, comic-book artist Milo Manara adapted the text into a fairly abridged graphic novel version named \"Le metamorfosi o l'asino d'oro\".\n\nIn the fantasy novel \"Silverlock\" by John Myers Myers, the character Lucius Gil Jones is a composite of Lucius, Gil Blas in \"Gil Blas\" by Alain-Ren√© Lesage, and Tom Jones in \"The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling\" by Henry Fielding.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n"}

Secretary, John Lambert; Chair, Mary Hamer; Deputy Chair, John Radcliffe; President, Roger Ayers; Librarian, John Walker; Journal Editor, Janet Montefiore. \nFounded in 1927 while Kipling was still alive, the society is one of the oldest and most enduring literary societies.\nThe Kipling Society was founded by J H C Brooking and a few fellow enthusiasts, including Kipling's school-friends Major General L C Dunsterville and G C Beresford, who featured in \"Stalky & Co.\" as \"Stalky\" and \"M'Turk\". Its aims are to promote interest in the works, life and times of Rudyard Kipling and to act as a physical and virtual meeting place for all those interested in him; to make the archive of existing knowledge accessible through its library and website; to foster new research and to support scholarly editions of previously unpublished work.\n\nMembership is open to anyone with an interest in the life and works of Rudyard Kipling. Members receive a copy of the quarterly Kipling Journal, and have access to the Society‚Äôs regular meetings, and to the Members‚Äô pages of the Society‚Äôs web-site. The Society holds five meetings a year in central London, providing lectures and discussions on a range of Kipling-related topics. Meetings and seminars are also held in other parts of Britain from time to time.\n\n\"The Kipling Journal\" is sent quarterly to all members of the Kipling Society and from January 2015 is peer-reviewed. It includes articles, membership news, Society events, and the texts of talks given by invited speakers. Every issue of the journal is available online via the website except articles published within two years of the current date. \n\nThe Society organises conferences in partnership with academic institutions. These have attracted international scholars and been significant in developing thinking about Kipling‚Äôs work.\n\n\"Kipling in America, 1892-1896\" was held at Marlboro College, Vermont, on October 7, 2013. This symposium on Kipling's four years in Brattleboro, Vermont after his marriage to the American Caroline Balestier, focused on the influence of Kipling‚Äôs time in America on his work.\n\"Rudyard Kipling: an international writer\" was hosted by the Institute of English Studies at University of London in October 2011. This coincided with the launch of \"The Cambridge Companion to Kipling\" and many of its contributors were also speakers.\n\"The Kent Conference\" was held at the University of Kent in September 2007. The conference was organised to mark the centenary of Kipling's Nobel Prize for Literature. It was directed by Dr Jan Montefiore and sponsored by the Kipling Society.\n\n\"Post-Colonial Kipling\" was held at Magdalene College, Cambridge University in September 2001, a century after the publication of \"Kim\". There were four major themes, Kipling: a post-colonial assessment, Kipling and women, Kipling and film, and Kipling in translation.\n\nThe Society maintains a research library of over 1,300 items which can be consulted by members. Kipling‚Äôs works were published in a variety of different editions during his lifetime and many of these are owned by the library. It holds a complete set of the Sussex Edition, the most complete single collection of Kipling‚Äôs works, which he edited before his death in 1936, and the Cambridge Edition of his verse, the most comprehensive collection of his poetry, edited by Thomas Pinney and published in 2013. The library contains biographies, collections of press cuttings, photographs and relevant memorabilia, critical studies and a growing set of translations of Kipling‚Äôs works in other languages. Until June 2014, the Library was housed at City University, London. Most of the collection is now at Haileybury College, Kipling‚Äôs old school, with some items being held at Sussex University.\n\nThe Society‚Äôs website is a source of information about Kipling‚Äôs life and works, including a number of his short stories and articles not published elsewhere. In addition, it offers a range of research tools, guides and back-issues of The Kipling Journal. The website also includes the Readers' Guide, providing introductions and notes to accompany each story, article, and poem. \nThe John Slater Memorial Kipling Essay Prize is awarded annually for the winning essay by a Sixth Form student, on selected works by Rudyard Kipling. The prize is ¬£750 (¬£250 for the student and ¬£500 for the school or college).\n\nA Rudyard Kipling discussion forum enables any member of the 'Rudyard-Kipling' mailbase to exchange messages by email with everyone else on the list globally.\n\nBateman's was Rudyard Kipling's House at Burwash in Sussex for over thirty years. It is now a National Trust property and there are close connections with the Kipling Society and a Bateman‚Äôs liaison officer keeps members informed of events and developments.\n\n"}
{"id": "2005810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005810", "title": "Ultra Series", "text": "Ultra Series\n\nThe is the collective name for all the shows produced by Tsuburaya Productions featuring Ultraman, his many brethren, and the myriad Ultra Monsters. The Ultra Series is one of the prominent tokusatsu superhero genre productions from Japan, along with Toei produced series \"Kamen Rider\", \"Super Sentai\" and the \"Metal Heroes\". The Ultra Series is also one of the most well known examples of the \"daikaiju\" (Â§ßÊÄ™Áç£, \"giant monster\") genre, along with Toho's \"Godzilla\" series, and Daiei Film's \"Gamera\" series. However, the Ultra Series also falls into the \"kyodai hƒ´ro\" (Â∑®Â§ß„Éí„Éº„É≠„Éº, \"giant hero\") subgenre of tokusatsu shows.\n\nAs revealed in \"\", the Ultramen are a technologically advanced civilization who were originally identical to humans. They were evolved into their current state of being following the activation of the Plasma Spark, which replaced their dead sun. Ultraman and his many kin are usually red-and-silver (although several color variations have been seen in recent years) and have glowing yellow almond-shaped dome eyes (although there are exceptions to both the shape and color) and various abilities, most notably firing energy beams from their crossed hands and flight. They share a strong cultural sense of justice and duty, a majority of Ultramen joining the to maintain peace in the universe from invaders and monsters.\n\nThe Ultramen that are sent to other worlds are given Color Timers, or \"warning lights\", which blink with increasing frequency and turn from blue to red if an Ultraman's energy supply dwindles or he is mortally wounded. Due to human pollution and the light filtering effects of the atmosphere, an Ultraman can remain active on Earth for a limited span of minutes before their energy is depleted and they die. This forces an Ultraman to either assume a human form or merge with a human host body. The latter process has healing properties that include reviving a recently dead person with their own lifeforce.\n\nUltra beings also appear to be near-impossible to permanently kill, as several times an Ultra being has been killed only to be revived by another member of their species. As when Mebius' allies revived him with their energy after his defeat by Empire, an Ultraman can be revived with a massive energy infusion. Ultramen always try to avoid battles in inhabited areas or near innocent bystanders, and try minimize collateral property damage. If these concerns cannot be met, a city like Tokyo could be destroyed.\n\nThe show \"Ultraman\" was followed by many other series. Sequels to the original series are: \"Ultra Seven\" (1967, TBS), \"The Return of Ultraman\" (1971, TBS), \"Ultraman Ace\" (1972, TBS), \"Ultraman Taro\" (1973, TBS), \"Ultraman Leo\" (1974, TBS), \"Ultraman 80\" (1980, TBS), \"Ultraman Tiga\" (1996, MBS), \"Ultraman Dyna\" (1997, MBS), \"Ultraman Gaia\" (1998, MBS), and \"Ultraman Cosmos\" (2001, MBS). Recently the studio tried a reinvention of the hero through the \"Ultra N Project\", which involved three heroes: Ultraman Noa (the \"mascot\" of the Ultra N Project, who appears in stage shows as well as the final episode of \"Ultraman Nexus\") in late 2003, \"Ultraman Nexus\" (2004, CBC), and \"ULTRAMAN\" (2004, Shochiku Productions). This was followed by a return to old-school style series in the form of \"Ultraman Max\" (2005, CBC). In the course of the \"Max\" series, another new hero known as Ultraman Xenon was also introduced. April 2006 saw the 40th anniversary series, \"Ultraman Mebius\", which signalled a long-awaited return to the original universe. Another hero was also introduced: \"Ultraman Hikari\", formerly known as Hunter Knight Tsurugi.\n\nThe franchise has also been in the movie theaters, starting with \"Ultraman Zearth\" and \"Ultraman Zearth 2,\" \",\" released in 2000, as well as \"ULTRAMAN,\" a movie that opened in December 2004. The straight-to-video market also saw the release of \"Ultraman Neos\" in 2000, as well as special features for Ultraman Tiga, Dyna, and Gaia, who have teamed up in theatrical features (Tiga and Dyna once, as well as the three of them all together). The \"Ultraman Mebius and Ultra Brothers\" movie opened in September 2006.\n\nForeign productions include the 1987 Hanna-Barbera co-production \"\" (in Japanese, \"Ultraman USA\"), an animated movie; \"\" (in Japanese, \"Ultraman Great\"), an Australian 1991 production and \"\" (in Japanese, \"Ultraman Powered\"), produced in the United States in 1993. Ultraman series have also been dubbed into various languages, including English, Spanish (only \"Ultra Q\", the original \"Ultraman\", \"Ultra Seven\", \"Return of Ultraman\", \"Ultraman Great\" & \"Ultraman Tiga\" were known to be translated into Spanish), Portuguese (\"Ultraman\", \"Ultra Seven\", \"Return of Ultraman\" and \"Ultraman Tiga\" in Brazil), Korean, Malay, Mandarin, Indonesian, Cantonese and Filipino (\"Ultraman Tiga\", \"Ultraman Dyna\", \"Ultraman Gaia\", \"Ultraman Nexus\", \"Ultraman Max\" and \"Ultraman Mebius\"). Also of note is the American English dub of \"Ultraman Tiga\" by 4Kids Entertainment that aired in 2002. The dub considerably distorted the characterization and general mood of the series, and it achieved only limited success.\n\nIn 1993, Tsuburaya Productions and Toei Company co-produced \"Ultraman vs. Kamen Rider,\" a crossover with the original Ultraman and Toei's \"Kamen Rider\". This direct-to-video feature is co-copyrighted by both Toei (and its subordinates, Toei Video and Ishinomori Productions) and Tsuburaya Productions.\n\nAt present, Tsuburaya Productions accepts 36 Ultramen as official (counting Ultraman Legend, the combined form of Ultramen Cosmos and Justice, as a separate entity). This figure does not account for Thai-produced Ultramen. (The figure is 38 if Next, Noa, and Nexus are counted as separate entities‚Äîit has been revealed in \"Nexus\" that all three are a single being with various modes used by different hosts.) In 2013, the Ultra Series was cited in the Guinness Book of World Records as the record-holder for the most number of spinoff shows. The Ultraman brand generated $7.4 billion in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987.\n\nThe government of Malaysia banned the printing of an \"Ultraman\" book because it compared the character of Ultraman King (from the film \"\") with \"Allah\", the Arabic word for God, even though it is commonly used in Malaysian to refer to any \"God\". The Ministry of Home Affairs stated that the comparison may \"confuse Muslim children and damage their faith\".\n\nIn 2017, \"\" and \"\" were released on January 8, 2017 in the United States as a double feature; this was the first North American theatrical release of an Ultraman feature film in its entire 50-year history. \"Ultraman Max\", \"Ultraman 80\", \"Ultraman Neos\", \"Ultraman Nexus\", \"Ultraseven X\", \"The Ultraman\" and more series began airing in the United States on the TOKU channel.\n\nAt the Tokyo Comic Con on December 7, 2017, Tsuburaya Productions revealed that an anime adaptation of the manga was planned for release in 2019.\n\nAlthough the different Ultra series and movies take place in different continuities, that does not mean that they take place in different canons. A major plot aspect of the Ultra Series is the multiverse, which is a collection of countless bubble-shaped universes. This was first hinted at in \"Ultraman Tiga\", and then again in \"Ultraman Dyna\", when the title character gets sucked into a wormhole that transports him throughout the multiverse. The multiverse was first glimpsed in the 2010 film \"\" when Ultraman Zero has to travel through it in order to get to his destination. The multiverse has become a bigger and bigger element of the plot over time, and the Ultras are now often seen traveling through the multiverse. In fact, the 2012 film \"Ultraman Saga\" takes place in four different universes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1998 \"Ultra Seven\" series\n\n\n1999 \"Ultra Seven\" series\n\n\n2001 Heisei Ultraman side stories\n\n\n2002 \"Ultra Seven: EVOLUTION\" series\n\n\n2007 Ultraman Mebius side story: \"Hikari Saga\"\n\n\n2008 Ultraman Mebius side story: \"Armored Darkness\"\n\n\n2009 Ultraman Mebius side story: \"Ghost Reverse\"\n\n\n2010 \n\n\n2011 Ultraman Zero side story: \"Killer the Beatstar\"\n\n\n\n\nIn Japan, there have been several box sets that were released which would each contain a particular Ultra series. As of now, there are only four such box sets. The sets were released as part of the Digital Ultra movement where the shows would be re-released with digital remastering.\n\nThe following are the series which have been released as such:\n\nThe \"Digital Ultra\" re-release order of the series may not match the chronological order in which they were originally aired in Japan.\n\nUltraman's licensing rights outside Japan have been the subject of a prolonged legal dispute between Tsuburaya Productions and Chaiyo Productions (also called Tsuburaya Chaiyo Co Ltd) based in Thailand. Tsuburaya had previously collaborated with Chaiyo on the production of two movies, \"The 6 Ultra Brothers vs. the Monster Army\" and \"Jumborg Ace & Giant\"‚Äîthe latter of which featured another Tsuburaya superhero, Jumborg Ace‚Äîin 1974. Sompote Saengduenchai, founder/president of Chaiyo Productions, claimed and maintained that in 1976, the late Noboru Tsuburaya, Eiji's son, who had died in 1995, had given him and his company a contract which had given him rights to everything Ultraman outside Japanese territories in exchange for a monetary loan. The claim is rumored to have originated from a gamble held by a drunken Hajime Tsuburaya (Noboru's older brother) and Sompote Saengduenchai over the rights to the franchise.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the document failed to state clearly and specifically exactly what had been given to Tsuburaya in exchange for these rights, Japanese and Thai courts accepted this contract as real and binding because of the supposed hanko of the late Noboru Tsuburaya in the document. Tsuburaya Productions insisted and maintained that the contract was a forgery (due to factual errors, including the faulty titles of the series in the document, such as \"Ultra Q\" being called \"Ultraman 1: Ultra Q\", \"Ultra Seven\" being called \"Ultraman 3: Ultraman Seven\", and Tsuburaya Productions being called \"Tsuburaya Prod. and Enterprises\", a name the company never did business under), and repeatedly contested the issue.\n\nIn the course of the legal battle, Sompote presented photos of himself sharing his photos of Thai Buddhist edifices stating that Eiji had based Ultraman's face on the said edifices, a claim which he has continued to hold since the dispute began. No other evidence supporting this claim was known to exist.\n\nAfter an 8-year battle in the courts of both countries, Sompote Saengduenchai was awarded a favorable decision on April 27, 2004. The exact ruling fell into some dispute: Some said it only gave him merchandising rights for the first six Ultra Series (\"Ultra Q\" through \"Ultraman Taro\") and \"Jumborg Ace\" outside Japan, and broadcasting rights of said shows within Thailand. Other accounts, usually reported in the Thai/Asian media, said that Chaiyo had gained the rights to those six shows everywhere outside Japan. The latter could be taken as Chaiyo's side of the story, as Tsuburaya was reported in the Japanese media to continue taking further action against them.\n\nTsuburaya decided not to market any of the disputed six Ultra Series outside Japan until it had completely settled the rights issues with Chaiyo, although the company continued to merchandise and distribute all of the Ultraman programs created after Ultraman Taro, including the theatrical feature \"Ultraman the Next,\" throughout the world. Because of the copyright struggle, importing literature on Ultraman into Singapore and Malaysia was prohibited. It also resulted in a slight backlash against Thai Ultraman fans, who were assumed to be outright Chaiyo supporters.\n\nIn 2005 the American company BCI Eclipse announced they had acquired the DVD rights to \"Ultraman\" from Chaiyo. A 3-disc box set containing the first 20 episodes of the series was released on July 18, 2006, and a second 3-disc box set containing the remaining 19 episodes was released on November 7, 2006. Both sets feature the original Japanese monaural dialogue track as well as the English-dubbed version produced by United Artists for North American syndication. At certain times, the English dialogue track switched over to the Japanese dialogue for small periods of time. This was because BCI had used audio from older recordings in which several scenes had to be cut or shortened for the American broadcast in order to fit running time constraints. Tsuburaya Productions still held on to the complete original English dubbing materials, which they had obtained from a warehouse in 1997, and refused to provide them for BCI. (Contrary to BCI's statements, the original English dubs were complete and uncut, except for a small cut in the conclusion of Episode 36, \"Gift From The Sky.\")\n\nDuring the time of the legal battle, Chaiyo came up with three of their own Ultras: Ultraman Millennium, Dark Ultraman (an evil Ultra), and Ultraman Elite. These were not used for purposes other than stage shows and merchandise. Chaiyo also created a TV series he called \"Project Ultraman\", un-aired as of late March 2008, a joint project in China featuring his own Ultraman and attaching Hong Kong star, Ekin Cheng to the project.\n\nOn August 23, 2006, Tsuburaya Productions filed a new lawsuit against Chaiyo for copyright infringement and plagiarism (concerning their three original Ultraman characters), and the court case was taken to China. The Chinese courts in Beijing opened \"The Ultraman Copyright Study Group\" in response to the lawsuit. In April 2007, the Thailand Intellectual Property Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions, ordering Chaiyo to cease and desist making commercial profits from Chaiyo-produced Ultraman characters such as Millennium, Dark, and Elite. The defendants were also fined THB 15,000,000 (approx. JPY 50,904,959 or US$428,673.50 c. April 2007) plus interest and attorneys' fees. \"Project Ultraman\" went on hiatus as a result of the ruling, which implied that although Chaiyo owned the right to some of the Ultraman series, it did not own the right to Ultraman and his brothers, including the design. Chaiyo gained permission to merchandise the original series, but lost the right to create and market its own Ultraman, or even use the original, without Tsuburaya's consent.\n\nOn February 5, 2008, Thailand's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions of Japan after they made an appeal to the initial ruling. The ruling ended the long legal battle by finding Sompote Saengduenchai was not a co-creator of Ultraman. The decision ended Sompote's bid to continue his enterprise, and the court gave Sompote 30 days to stop profiteering from Ultraman. The final ruling saw Tsuburaya Productions as the sole copyright owner. Sompote was also required to pay THB 10,700,000 plus interest at the rate of 7.5 per cent a year starting from December 16, 1997, when the original lawsuit was filed.\n\nIn 2009, the Thai Intellectual Property Court and the Tokyo District Court both ruled in favour of the Thai company. This led to the Tokyo District Court on September 30, 2010, ordering Tsuburaya Productions Co of Japan to pay damages of 16.36 million yen (Bt5.9 million) to Sompote Saengduenchai of Thailand for violating his overseas copyrights on Ultraman characters.\n\nAfter the announcement of the \"\" movie in July 2017, the dispute on the ownership of the franchise has escalated. But in November 20, 2017, through a Los Angeles court ruling by judge Judge Andre Birotte Jr, Tsuburaya won the lawsuit against Chaiyo and affiliate groups on the rights of the series after the jury concluded that the supposed agreement between Noboru Tsuburaya and Chaiyo was \"not authentic\". Despite UM Corporation and Chaiyo filing a counter-dispute, on April 18, 2018, the legal court came to a definite close where a final judgement states that the dispute and the document was deemed invalid, forbidding UMC to use the Ultra Series and all its related characters and forced them to pay Tsubaraya damages for its infringement of its rights.\n\n"}
