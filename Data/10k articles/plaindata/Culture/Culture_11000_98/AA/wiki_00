{"id": "32235697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32235697", "title": "American fiddle", "text": "American fiddle\n\nAmerican fiddle-playing began with the early settlers who found that the small \"viol\" family instruments were portable and rugged. According to Ron Yule, \"John Utie, a 1620 immigrant, settled in the North and is credited as being the first known fiddler on American soil\". Early influences were Irish fiddle styles as well as Scottish and the more refined traditions of classical violin playing. Popular tunes included \"Soldier's Joy\", for which Robert Burns had written lyrics, and other such tunes as \"Flowers of Edinburgh\" and \"Tamlin,\" which were claimed by both Scottish and Irish lineages.\n\nSoon these tunes were Americanized; local variations developed in the Northern and Southern colonies. In contemporary American fiddle styles, the New England states are heavily influenced by all Celtic styles, including Cape Breton fiddle-playing; whereas Southern or \"Dixie\" fiddle styles have tended to develop their own traditions, which emphasize double stops and in some instances the incorporation of dance calls or simple lyrics.\n\nIn a radical departure from tradition, groups such as Trio Chipontepec are cropping up at American fiddle festivals. Rock is fusing with country, jazz with rock, and classical violinists are retooling in an era characterized by home recording studios and the easy availability of new media such as MP3 downloads.\n\nSome folk fiddlers distinguish \"fiddle\" from \"violin\", though this is far from universal - many classical violinists refer to their \"fiddle\". Nevertheless, a few common differences may be observed;\n\nGenerally, the setup of the instruments is different:\n\n\nFiddle playing generally avoids vibrato except for occasional slow tempo pieces and even then uses less vibrato. Shorter bow strokes are also consistent with the fiddle players' tendency to use less legato and more detache bow strokes. Some, but not all, styles use double stops and open tunings. Trick fiddling is employed, often built upon cross bowing technique such as used in Orange Blossom Special or Beaumont Rag.\nBowing by fiddle players is quite different in that they may intentionally grip the frog in a crude manner and typically choke up on the bow. See for instance Rhiannon Giddens of the Carolina Chocolate Drops Massachusetts performance of \"Genuine Negro Jig\" in May 2010.\n\nFiddle players tend to play fiddle \"tunes\" rather than sonatas and other classical types of compositions. There are exceptions. For instance, partitas have been popular with fiddle players, particularly since publication of the Open House CD by Kevin Burke, an Irish style player based in Portland, Oregon. Fiddles are typically associated with country and other genres of popular music while violins are usually associated with classical and other genres of art music.\n\n\nAlso known as \"OBS\", Orange Blossom Special exploits the capacity of fiddle or violin to imitate various mechanical tones. Authorship is controversial.\n\nThe canonical American fiddle tune, \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" was written by Charlie Daniels as an interpretation the \"Lonesome Fiddle Blues\" by Vassar Clements and has been covered innumerable times. Although classified as country rock, the tune uses licks based on old-time fiddle playing and rock guitar riffs. Unlike most old-time playing, the instrument ranges high up the neck, exploiting both the legendary association of the fiddle as \"the devil's instrument\" and the intensity of rapid sixteenth or thirty-second notes. These effects are achieved through rapid detache bowing bordering on outright tremolo. The motif of a deal with the Devil may have been influenced by Cross Road Blues, by Delta blues singer Robert Johnson.\n\nAccording to London-based music writer Chris Haigh, fiddle \" was among the primary instruments used by the rural blacks...\" He contends that by 1930 over 50 different black blues fiddle players had recordings. Many musicians who were guitar stars also played fiddle including:\n\n\nBlues fiddle uses the pentatonic blues scale to create riffs for breaks and over guitar chords typically in the standard blues progression. Vibrato is not often used, although may occasionally be used in an exaggerated manner for special effect.\n\nViolin, Sing The Blues For Me\n\nAfrican-American Fiddlers 1926-1949\nOld Hat CD-1002\n\nOld time fiddle uses a profusion of double stops and authentic players typically tune their instruments in \"open tunings\" or cross tunings. The set ups often include flattened bridges and in some cases no chin rest. The most popular tuning ia AEAE for the key of A, but the instrument can be down tuned to GDGD, which may put less tension on the neck when playing solo. ADAE is also popular for the key of D, and standard (GDAE) is often used for G. Some of the earliest popular repertoire includes \"Turkey in the Straw,\" \"Arkansas Traveler,\" \"Billy in the Lowground.\" Accompanying instruments include washboard, jug bass, banjo, dulcimer, guitar, and occasionally kazoo.\n\nAccording to some sources, old time music is actually the \"early recorded country music of the 1920s and 1930s, particularly of the southeastern states\" thus narrowing the definition considerably. Nevertheless, a broader definition usually prevails which incorporates unrecorded music with roots long before radio transmission and sound recording were invented. Within old time music there are regional subgenres, such as the Deep South and Appalachia, where fiddle music is often intertwined with cultural phenomena such as coal mining.\n\nA comprehensive review of old time fiddle styles was written by David Reiner and Peter Anick and published in 1989.\n\nBluegrass music originated in the person of Bill Monroe. According to Haigh, \"Monroe always considered the fiddle to be the key instrument of bluegrass\".\n\n\nAccording to Ron Yule, \"Louisiana fiddling had its birth roots in Europe, with fiddling being noted as early as the 15th century in Scotland.\" The most widely known Cajun fiddler is Doug Kershaw.\n\nZydeco music is closely related.\n\nRock fiddle, like rock music in general, owes much to American blues. Incorporation of fiddle or violin into rock, as with jazz, has been a slow process, resisted by some critics as an\"unlikeliest and perverse misuse of an instrument\". Rock has roots in folk music particularly the American folk revival of the 1960s, and thus as a matter of usage some writers refer to \"rock fiddle\" when discussing playing by classically trained musicians who join rock bands and thus import classical style rather than fiddle style into their playing.\n\n\nRock violinists often use solid body electric violins to reduce feedback. Rock is an international phenomenon and is consequently influenced by cross fertilizations from rock players such as Ashley MacIsaac Nevertheless, American rockers continue to experiment. For instance, eclectic rocker Natalie Stovall, a graduate of Berkelee Conservatory, covers Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Michael Jackson, Lenny Kravitz, The White Stripes, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Jimi Hendrix, all the while alternating between standard rock vocals and fiddle/violin riffs.\n\nOther rock fiddle or violin players include\n\n\nJazz playing on the fiddle is often called jazz violin but there are some instances in which \"jazz fiddle\" is discussed. For instance Mel Bay contributor Martin Norgard presents jazz fiddle in numerous media (book, website). Nevertheless, instructional jazz playing was preceded by the highly influential 1992 Oak Publications volume Jazz Violin\" by Matt Glaser and Stephane Grapelli. The topic is indeed covered on the Wikipedia online encyclopedia at the article page entitled Jazz violin. Australian jazz player Ian Cooper is presented as a violinist. Dutch eclectic player Tim Kliphuis presents his jazz instructional material as \"Jazz Swing Violin Fiddle\" but his website quotes the Glasgow Herald review which denominates hims as a \"splendid young...violinist\".\n\nThis music, usually considered to be synonymous with Western swing, is \"bona fide\" fiddle music and is deeply intertwined with country and folk music as played by Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Vince Gill, Dale Watson, the Wheel's Jason Roberts, Jesse Dayton, and Garrison Keillor. A well-known example of this music is \"Faded Love\", which despite some controversy is generally attributed to Bob Wills.:*Mark O'Connor is a legendary performer who also plays bluegrass and jazz but got started as a youth contender in fiddle contests.\n\nOne of the most prominent examples of the New England fiddle tradition was Maine's Mellie Dunham, who was a sensation in his day. Today New England fiddle playing is exemplified by Rounder Records artist Frank Ferrel. He refers to the style as \"Down East\" in his volume \"Boston Fiddle\". Unlike other fiddle traditions, piano accompaniment is common, and, he notes occasionally saxophone or clarinet would join in. Another feature is frequent use of minor keys particularly G minor and also the \"flat keys\" of F Major and B flat Major, which are not typically used in Old Time and other indigenous music traditions. Ferrell traces his roots into the 1800s Boston Scottish and Irish cultures as typified in musicians such as William Bradbury Ryan. Like all Celtic American fiddle traditions, his is influenced by the publication of Chief O'Neil's massive directory of fiddle tunes in 1903 Thus, Ferrel and others in the North East tradition use the full panoply of Irish fiddle ornamentation.\n\nOther influences include Scottish fiddling and Cape Breton style, which has its own blend of Celtic traditions which include also Normandy styles.\n\nAmerican fiddle traditions are deeply influenced by international influence from numerous immigrations and ordinary commerce particularly from Anglo-Celtic and Canadian sources. Québécois French, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. \nSome observers categorize Maritime influence as a cosmopolitan trend of its own blending otherwise distinct styles \nwhich outlines several influences on what they call Northeastern Fiddling Styles: Cape Breton, French-Canadian (Québécois) and Maritime.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1013900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1013900", "title": "Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.", "text": "Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.\n\nArthur Meier Schlesinger Jr. (; born Arthur Bancroft Schlesinger; October 15, 1917 – February 28, 2007) was an American historian, social critic, and public intellectual. The son of the influential historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr. and a specialist in American history, much of Schlesinger's work explored the history of 20th-century American liberalism. In particular, his work focused on leaders such as Harry S. Truman, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and Robert F. Kennedy. In the 1952 and 1956 presidential campaigns, he was a primary speechwriter and adviser to the Democratic presidential nominee, Adlai Stevenson II. Schlesinger served as special assistant and \"court historian\" to President Kennedy from 1961 to 1963. He wrote a detailed account of the Kennedy administration, from the 1960 presidential campaign to the president's state funeral, titled \"A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House\", which won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography.\n\nIn 1968, Schlesinger actively supported the presidential campaign of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, which ended with Kennedy's assassination in Los Angeles. Schlesinger wrote a popular biography, \"Robert Kennedy and His Times\", several years later. He later popularized the term \"imperial presidency\" during the Nixon administration in his book of the same name.\n\nSchlesinger was born in Columbus, Ohio, the son of Elizabeth Harriet (née Bancroft) and Arthur M. Schlesinger (1888–1965), who was an influential social historian at Ohio State University and Harvard University, where he directed many PhD dissertations in American history. His paternal grandfather was a Prussian Jew who converted to Protestantism and then married an Austrian Catholic. His mother, a Mayflower descendant, was of German and New England ancestry, as well as a relative of historian George Bancroft, according to family tradition. His family practiced Unitarianism.\n\nSchlesinger attended the Phillips Exeter Academy, New Hampshire, and received his first degree at the age of 20 from Harvard College, where he graduated \"summa cum laude\" in 1938. After spending the 1938–1939 academic year at Peterhouse, Cambridge as a Henry Fellow, he was appointed to a three-year Junior Fellowship in the Harvard Society of Fellows in the fall of 1939. At the time, Fellows were not allowed to pursue advanced degrees, \"a requirement intended to keep them off the standard academic treadmill\"; as such, Schlesinger would never earn a doctorate. His fellowship was interrupted by the United States entering World War II. After failing his military medical examination, Schlesinger joined the Office of War Information. From 1943 to 1945, he served as an intelligence analyst in the Office of Strategic Services, a precursor to the CIA.\n\nSchlesinger's service in the OSS allowed him time to complete his first Pulitzer Prize–winning book, \"The Age of Jackson\", in 1945. From 1946 to 1954, he was an associate professor at Harvard, becoming a full professor in 1954.\n\nIn 1947, Schlesinger, together with former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, Minneapolis mayor and future Senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey, economist and longtime friend John Kenneth Galbraith, and Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, founded Americans for Democratic Action. Schlesinger acted as the ADA's national chairman from 1953 to 1954.\n\nAfter President Harry S. Truman announced he would not run for a second full term in the 1952 presidential election, Schlesinger became the primary speechwriter for and an ardent supporter of Governor Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois. In the 1956 election, Schlesinger, along with 30-year-old Robert F. Kennedy, again worked on Stevenson's campaign staff. Schlesinger supported the nomination of Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy, as Stevenson's vice-presidential running mate, but at the Democratic convention, Kennedy came second in the vice-presidential balloting, losing to Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee.\n\nSchlesinger had known John F. Kennedy since attending Harvard and increasingly socialized with Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline in the 1950s. In 1954, the \"Boston Post\" publisher John Fox Jr. had planned series of newspaper pieces labeling several Harvard figures, including Schlesinger, as \"reds\", Kennedy intervened on Schlesinger's behalf, which Schlesinger recounted in \"A Thousand Days\".\n\nDuring the 1960 campaign, Schlesinger supported Kennedy, causing much consternation to Stevenson loyalists. At the time, however, Kennedy was an active candidate while Stevenson refused to run unless he was drafted at the convention. After Kennedy won the nomination, Schlesinger helped the campaign as a (sometime) speechwriter, speaker, and member of the ADA. He also wrote the book \"Kennedy or Nixon: Does It Make Any Difference?\" in which he lauded Kennedy's abilities and scorned Vice President Richard M. Nixon as having \"no ideas, only methods... He cares about winning.\"\n\nAfter the election, the president-elect offered Schlesinger an ambassadorship and Assistant Secretary of State for Cultural Relations before Robert Kennedy proposed for Schlesinger to serve as a \"sort of roving reporter and troubleshooter.\" Schlesinger quickly accepted, and on January 30, 1961, he resigned from Harvard and was appointed Special Assistant to the President. He worked primarily on Latin American affairs and as a speechwriter during his tenure in the White House.\nIn February 1961, Schlesinger was first told of the \"Cuba operation,\" which would eventually become the Bay of Pigs Invasion. He opposed the plan in a memorandum to the president: \"at one stroke you would dissipate all the extraordinary good will which has been rising toward the new Administration through the world. It would fix a malevolent image of the new Administration in the minds of millions.\" He, however, suggested,\n\nDuring the Cabinet deliberations, he \"shrank into a chair at the far end of the table and listened in silence\" as the Joint Chiefs and CIA representatives lobbied the president for an invasion. Along with his friend, Senator William Fulbright, Schlesinger sent several memos to the president opposing the strike; however, during the meetings, he held back his opinion, reluctant to undermine the President's desire for a unanimous decision. Following the overt failure of the invasion, Schlesinger later lamented, \"In the months after the Bay of Pigs, I bitterly reproached myself for having kept so silent during those crucial discussions in the cabinet room. ... I can only explain my failure to do more than raise a few timid questions by reporting that one's impulse to blow the whistle on this nonsense was simply undone by the circumstances of the discussion.\" After the furor died down, Kennedy joked that Schlesinger \"wrote me a memorandum that will look pretty good when he gets around to writing his book on my administration. Only he better not publish that memorandum while I'm still alive!\" During the Cuban missile crisis, Schlesinger was not a member of the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM) but helped UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson draft his presentation of the crisis to the UN Security Council.\n\nAfter President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Schlesinger resigned his position in January 1964. He wrote a memoir/history of the Kennedy administration, \"A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House\", which won him his second Pulitzer Prize in 1965.\n\nSchlesinger returned to teaching in 1966 as the Albert Schweitzer Professor of the Humanities at the Graduate Center of The City University of New York. After his retirement from teaching in 1994, he remained an active member of the Graduate Center community as an emeritus professor until his death.\n\nAfter his service for the Kennedy administration, he continued to be a Kennedy loyalist for the rest of his life, campaigning for Robert Kennedy's tragic presidential campaign in 1968 and for Senator Edward M. Kennedy in 1980. Upon the request of Robert Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy, he wrote the biography \"Robert Kennedy and His Times\", which was published in 1978.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, he greatly criticized Richard Nixon as both a candidate and president. His prominent status as a liberal Democrat and outspoken disdain of Nixon led to his placement on the master list of Nixon's political opponents. Ironically, Nixon would become his next-door neighbor in the years following the Watergate scandal.\n\nAfter he retired from teaching, he remained involved in politics for the rest of his life through his books and public speaking tours. Schlesinger was a critic of the Clinton Administration, resisting President Clinton's cooptation of his \"Vital Center\" concept in an article for Slate in 1997. Schlesinger was also a critic of the 2003 Iraq War and called it a misadventure. He put much blame on the media for not covering a reasoned case against the war.\n\nSchlesinger's name at birth was Arthur Bancroft Schlesinger; since his mid-teens, he had instead used the signature \"Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.\" He had five children, four from his first marriage to author and artist Marian née Cannon and a son and stepson from his second marriage, to Alexandra Emmet, also an artist.\n\nAs a prominent Democrat and historian, Schlesinger maintained a very active social life. His wide circle of friends and associates included politicians, actors, writers, and artists, spanning several decades. Among his friends and associates were President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Edward M. Kennedy, Adlai E. Stevenson, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, John Kenneth Galbraith, W. Averell and Pamela Harriman, Steve and Jean Kennedy Smith, Ethel Skakel Kennedy, Ted Sorensen, Eleanor Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr., Alice Roosevelt Longworth, Hubert Humphrey, Henry Kissinger, Marietta Peabody Tree, Ben Bradlee, Joseph Alsop, Evangeline Bruce, William vanden Heuvel, Kurt Vonnegut, Norman Mailer, Philip and Katharine Graham, Leonard Bernstein, Walter Lippmann, President Lyndon Johnson, Nelson Rockefeller, Lauren Bacall, Marlene Dietrich, George McGovern, Robert McNamara, McGeorge Bundy, Jack Valenti, Bill Moyers, Richard Goodwin, Al Gore, President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchlesinger died on February 28, 2007, at the age of 89 when he experienced cardiac arrest while he was dining out with family members in Manhattan. The newspapers dubbed him a \"historian of power.\"\n\nHe won a Pulitzer Prize for History in 1946 for his book \"The Age of Jackson\", covering the intellectual environment of Jacksonian democracy.\n\nHis 1949 book \"The Vital Center\" made a case for the New Deal policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and was harshly critical of both unregulated capitalism and of those liberals such as Henry A. Wallace who advocated coexistence with communism.\n\nIn his book \"The Politics of Hope\" (1962), Schlesinger terms conservatives the \"party of the past\" and liberals \"the party of hope\" and calls for overcoming the division between both parties.\n\nHe won a second Pulitzer in the Biography category in 1966 for \"A Thousand Days\".\n\nHis 1986 book \"The Cycles of American History\" was an early work on cycles in politics in the United States; it was influenced by his father's work on cycles.\n\nHe became a leading opponent of multiculturalism in the 1980s and articulated this stance in his book \"The Disuniting of America\" (1991).\n\nPublished posthumously in 2007, \"Journals 1952–2000\" is the 894-page distillation of 6,000 pages of Schlesinger diaries on a wide variety of subjects, edited by Andrew and Stephen Schlesinger.\n\nThis is a list of his published works:\n\nBesides writing biographies he also wrote a foreword to a book on Vladimir Putin which came out in 2003 under the same name and was published by Chelsea House Publishers.\n\nSchlesinger's papers will be available at the New York Public Library.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "390597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=390597", "title": "Astronomical symbols", "text": "Astronomical symbols\n\nAstronomical symbols are abstract pictorial symbols used to represent astronomical objects, theoretical constructs and observational events in astronomy. The earliest forms of these symbols appear in Greek papyrus texts of late antiquity. The Byzantine codices in which many Greek papyrus texts were preserved continued and extended the inventory of astronomical symbols. New symbols were further invented to represent many newly-discovered planets and minor planets discovered in the 18th to the 20th centuries.\n\nThese symbols were once commonly used by professional astronomers, amateur astronomers, alchemists, and astrologers. While they are still commonly used in almanacs and astrological publications, their occurrence in published research and texts on astronomy is relatively infrequent, with some exceptions such as the Sun and Earth symbols appearing in astronomical constants, and certain zodiacal signs used to represent the solstices and equinoxes.\n\nUnicode has formally assigned code points to most symbols, mainly in the Miscellaneous Symbols Block and the Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs Block.\n\nThe use of astronomical symbols for the Sun and Moon dates to antiquity. The forms of the symbols that appear in the original papyrus texts of Greek horoscopes are a circle with one ray () for the Sun and a crescent for the Moon. The modern sun symbol, a circle with a dot (☉), first appeared in Europe in the Renaissance.\n\nIn modern academic usage, the sun symbol is used for astronomical constants relating to the sun. T represents the solar effective temperature, and the luminosity, mass, and radius of stars are often represented using the corresponding solar constants (, , and , respectively) as units of measurement.\n\nSymbols for the classical planets appear in many medieval Byzantine codices in which many ancient horoscopes were preserved. The written symbols for Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn have been traced to forms found in late Greek papyrus texts. The symbols for Jupiter and Saturn are identified as monograms of the corresponding Greek names, and the symbol for Mercury is a stylized caduceus. According to A. S. D. Maunder, antecedents of the planetary symbols were used in art to represent the gods associated with the classical planets; \"Bianchini's planisphere\", produced in the 2nd century, shows Greek personifications of planetary gods charged with early versions of the planetary symbols: Mercury has a caduceus; Venus has, attached to her necklace, a cord connected to another necklace; Mars, a spear; Jupiter, a staff; Saturn, a scythe; the Sun, a circlet with rays radiating from it; and the Moon, a headdress with a crescent attached.\n\nA diagram in Byzantine astronomer Johannes Kamateros's 12th century \"Compendium of Astrology\" shows the Sun represented by the circle with a ray, Jupiter by the letter \"zeta\" (the initial of Zeus, Jupiter's counterpart in Greek mythology), Mars by a shield crossed by a spear, and the remaining classical planets by symbols resembling the modern ones, without the cross-mark seen in modern versions of the symbols. These cross-marks first appear around the 16th century. According to Maunder, the addition of crosses appears to be \"an attempt to give a savour of Christianity to the symbols of the old pagan gods.\"\n\nThe symbols for Uranus were created shortly after its discovery. One symbol, , invented by J. G. Köhler and refined by Bode, was intended to represent the newly discovered metal platinum; since platinum, commonly called white gold, was found by chemists mixed with iron, the symbol for platinum combines the alchemical symbols for iron, ♂, and gold, ☉. This symbol also combines the symbols of Mars (♂) and the Sun (☉) because in Greek mythology Uranus represented heaven, and represents the combined power of Mars's spear and the Sun. \nAnother symbol, , was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as \"un globe surmonté par la première lettre de votre nom\" (\"a globe surmounted by the first letter of your name\").\n\nSeveral symbols were proposed for Neptune to accompany the suggested names for the planet. Claiming the right to name his discovery, Urbain Le Verrier originally proposed the name \"Neptune\" and the symbol of a trident, while falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes. In October, he sought to name the planet \"Leverrier\", after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, François Arago, who in turn proposed a new symbol for the planet (). However, this suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France. French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name \"Herschel\" for \"Uranus\", after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and \"Leverrier\" for the new planet. Professor James Pillans of the University of Edinburgh defended the name \"Janus\" for the new planet, and proposed a key for its symbol. Meanwhile, German-Russian astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve presented the name \"Neptune\" on December 29, 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. In August 1847, the Bureau des Longitudes announced its decision to follow prevailing astronomical practice and adopt the choice of \"Neptune\", with Arago refraining from participating in this decision.\n\nThe International Astronomical Union discourages the use of these symbols in journal articles. In certain cases where planetary symbols might be used, such as in the headings of tables, the IAU Style Manual permits certain one- and (to disambiguate Mercury and Mars) two-letter abbreviations for the names of the planets.\n\nFollowing the discovery of Ceres in 1801 by the astronomer and Catholic priest Giuseppe Piazzi, a group of astronomers ratified the name, which Piazzi had proposed. At that time, the sickle was chosen as a symbol of the planet.\n\nThe symbol for 2 Pallas, the spear of Pallas Athena, was invented by Baron Franz Xaver von Zach, who organized a group of twenty-four astronomers to search for a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The symbol was introduced by von Zach in his \"Monatliche correspondenz zur beförderung der erd- und himmels-kunde\".\nIn a letter to von Zach, discoverer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers (who had named the newly discovered asteroid) expressed his approval of the proposed symbol, but wished that the handle of the sickle of Ceres had been adorned with a pommel instead of a crossbar, to better differentiate it from the sign of Venus.\n\nGerman astronomer Karl Ludwig Harding created the symbol for 3 Juno. Harding, who discovered this asteroid in 1804, proposed the name Juno and the use of a scepter topped with a star as its astronomical symbol.\n\nThe symbol for 4 Vesta was invented by German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. Dr. Olbers, having previously discovered and named 2 Pallas, gave Gauss the honor of naming his newest discovery. Gauss decided to name the new asteroid for the goddess Vesta, and also designed the symbol (): the altar of the goddess, with the sacred fire burning on it. Other contemporaneous writers use a more elaborate symbol () instead.\n\nKarl Ludwig Hencke, a German amateur astronomer, discovered the next two asteroids, 5 Astraea (in 1845) and 6 Hebe (in 1847). Hencke requested that the symbol for 5 Astraea be an upside-down anchor; however, a pair of balances was sometimes used instead. Gauss named 6 Hebe at Hencke's request, and chose a wineglass as the symbol.\n\nAs more new asteroids were discovered, astronomers continued to assign symbols to them. Thus, 7 Iris had for its symbol a rainbow with a star; 8 Flora, a flower; 9 Metis, an eye with a star; 10 Hygiea, an upright snake with a star on its head; 11 Parthenope, a standing fish with a star; 12 Victoria, a star topped with a branch of laurel; 13 Egeria, a buckler; 14 Irene, a dove carrying an olive branch with a star on its head; 15 Eunomia, a heart topped with a star; 16 Psyche, a butterfly wing with a star; 17 Thetis, a dolphin with a star; 18 Melpomene, a dagger over a star; and 19 Fortuna, a star over Fortuna's wheel.\n\nJohann Franz Encke made a major change in the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch (BAJ, Berlin Astronomical Yearbook) for the year 1854, published in 1851. He introduced encircled numbers instead of symbols, although his numbering began with Astraea, the first four asteroids continuing to be denoted by their traditional symbols. This symbolic innovation was adopted very quickly by the astronomical community. The following year (1852), Astraea's number was bumped up to 5, but Ceres through Vesta would be listed by their numbers only in the 1867 edition. The circle later became a pair of parentheses, and the parentheses were sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades.\n\nA few asteroids were given symbols by their discoverers after the encircled-number notation became widespread. 26 Proserpina, 28 Bellona, 35 Leukothea, and 37 Fides, all discovered by German astronomer Robert Luther between 1853 and 1855, were assigned, respectively, a pomegranate with a star inside; a whip and spear; an antique lighthouse; and a cross. 29 Amphitrite was named and assigned a shell for its symbol by George Bishop, the owner of the observatory where astronomer Albert Marth discovered it in 1854.\n\nPluto's name and symbol were announced by the discoverers on May 1, 1930. \nThe symbol, a monogram of the letters PL, could be interpreted to stand for Pluto or for Percival Lowell, the astronomer who initiated Lowell Observatory's search for a planet beyond the orbit of Neptune.\n\nThe zodiac symbols have several astronomical interpretations. Depending on context, a zodiac symbol may denote either a constellation, or a point or interval on the ecliptic plane.\n\nLists of astronomical phenomena published by almanacs sometimes included conjunctions of stars and planets or the Moon; rather than print the full name of the star, a Greek letter and the symbol for the constellation of the star was sometimes used instead. The ecliptic was sometimes divided into 12 \"signs\", each subdivided into 30 degrees, and the \"sign\" component of ecliptic longitude was expressed either with a number from 0 to 11 or with the corresponding zodiac symbol.\n\nIn modern academic usage, all the constellations, including the twelve of the zodiac, have dedicated three-letter abbreviations. The zodiac symbols are also sometimes used to represent points on the ecliptic, particularly the solstices and equinoxes. Each symbol is taken to represent the \"first point\" of each sign. Thus, ♈︎ the symbol for Aries, represents the March equinox; ♋︎, for Cancer, the June solstice; ♎︎, for Libra, the September equinox; and ♑︎, for Capricorn, the December solstice.\n\nSymbols for aspects and nodes appear in medieval texts, although medieval and modern usage of the node symbols differ; the modern ascending node symbol (☊) formerly stood for the descending node, and the modern descending node symbol (☋) was used for the ascending node. In describing the Keplerian elements of an orbit, ☊ is sometimes used to denote the ecliptic longitude of the ascending node, although it is more common to use Ω (capital omega), which was originally a typographical substitute for the astronomical symbol.\n\nThe symbols for aspects first appear in Byzantine codices. Of the symbols for the five Ptolemaic aspects, only the three displayed here—for conjunction, opposition, and quadrature—are used in astronomy.\n\nSymbols for a comet (☄) and a star () have been used in published astronomical observations of comets. In tables of these observations, ☄ stood for the comet being discussed and for the star of comparison relative to which measurements of the comet's position were made.\n\n"}

{"id": "54277511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54277511", "title": "Cross dressing ball", "text": "Cross dressing ball\n\nGay balls, cross dressing balls or drag balls, depending on the place, time, and type, were public or private balls, celebrated mainly in the first third of the twentieth century, where cross dressing and ballroom dancing with same sex partners was allowed. By the 1900s, the balls had become important cultural events for gays and lesbians, even attracting tourists. Their golden age was during the Interwar period, mainly in Berlin and Paris, even though they could be found in many big cities in Europe and the Americas.\n\nBy the end of the 17th century, a gay subculture is documented in Europe, with their cruising areas, their bars, their parties and balls, their cross-dressers, and their own slang. Scholars like Randolph Trumbach consider it is the moment when gay subculture appears in Europe. On the contrary, historian Rictor Norton considers unlikely that such a subculture would appear fully formed, and thinks that it was actually the increase in surveillance and police procedures that brought to the surface an underground culture that had not been visible up to that moment.\n\nThe archives of the Portuguese Inquisition in Lisbon preserve information of the so-called \"\"danças dos fanchonos\" from the beginning of the 17 century. About 1620, the \"fachonos\", the baroque equivalent of modern drag queens, organized big parties in the \"Gaia Lisboa\", the gay Lisbon. These itinerant celebrations, called \"escarramão\", or \"esparramão\"\", used to include pantomimes with racy scenes, where some of the participants were dressed as women, and other as men. His Majesty's High Court in Mexico City discovered in 1656 a similar case, when Juan Correa, an old man, over 70 years old, confessed that he had been committing the unspeakable vice since his childhood. Correa's house, in the outskirts of the city, had been used as a meeting point to celebrate balls, where many men dressed as women.\n\nSeveral studies have not found similar phenomena in the judicial cases in Aragon, Catalonia, the Basque Country or Valencia, even though in the Valencian case there are evidences of a subculture and a possible gay ghetto. In Spain, cross-dressing was socially only allowed for carnival, when even those closest to the king could dress as women. On the other hand, in France, during Louis XIV's reign, no ball was complete without cross-dressers.\n\nBy the end of the 17th century, there was a completely developed gay subculture in London, with the molly houses used as clubs, where gays met regularly to drink, dance and have fun. These taverns are well known thanks to the Mother Clap's molly house scandal from 1726, when a police raid discovered that her molly house was a gay brothel.\n\nBerlin's clandestine gay underground can be followed up to the 18th century, in spite of the persecution gays were suffering. In Prussia, Paragraph 143 of the penal code, and later the introduction of Paragraph 175 in the German penal code, with other laws for public scandal, and child protection, made the life of gays extremely difficult. Clearly, not the activities of Magnus Hirschfeld or the first homosexual movement could avoid the regular police raids and closing of premises in the 1900s. And not just the premises were being watched by the police, in 1883, the moral police had 4799 \"transvestite\" and transgender woman under vigilance, even though \"permits\" could be handed out to cross-dressers in cases considered \"medical\".\n\nIt is thus surprising that, beginning mid 19th century, the \"Urningsball\" or \"Tuntenball\" came to be, balls of uranians, or queens, tolerated, but watched by the police. By the 1900s, these balls had achieved such a fame in Germany, that people from all around the country, and even foreign tourists, would travel to Berlin to participate. These balls were celebrated in large ballrooms, as the Deutscher Kaiser, in the Lothringer Straße, or the Filarmonía, in the Bernburgstraße, the Dresdner Kasino, in the Dresdner Straße, or the Orpheum, in the Alter Jakobstraße 32. For example, the \"Berliner Morgenpost\" described extensively on October 17, 1899, a gay ball that had taken place in the hotel König von Portugal, where balls were still being celebrated in 1918. The ball season used to begin in October and go until Easter, with a frequency of several baa week, sometimes two the same day. Hirschfeld, in his book \"Berlins drittes Geschlecht\" (1904; \"Berlín's Third Sex\"), described the balls in following fashion:\n\nAs a consequence of the Harden–Eulenburg affair, and the subsequent social upheaval, the balls where prohibited; in 1910 they were allowed again, but they never achieved the splendor of this golden age.\n\nAfter the I World War appeared the first mass movements for homosexuals, the \"Freundschaftsbund\", popular associations of gays and lesbians that dedicated an important part of their effort to socialization and diverse activities for their members, like excursions, visits, sports, and balls. For example, the club \"Kameradschaft\" (\"camaraderie\") organized on November 1, 1929, celebrating their anniversary, a Böser-Buben-Ball (\"Bad Boys Ball\"); the club reached 100 members, and survived until 1933. \"Kameradschaft\" tried to offer some support and activities for gays from lower extraction; so their balls were celebrated on weekends, Saturdays or Sundays, and gathered about 70 men, many without a job, who could pay the low entry price. In 1922 the association Gesellschaftsklub Aleksander e.V. celebrated balls every day, beginning 7 o'clock p.m., with a quality orchestra. In 1927 the Bund für Menschenrecht (BfM) bought the Alexander-Palast, but that same year they changed to the Florida and the Tanz-Palast salon of the Zauberflöte, in the Kommandantenstraße 72, in Berlin. The BfM balls took place from Tuesdays to Sundays; the entry was free, but you had to pay 50 Pfennig for a dance card that allowed you to actually dance. In the 1920s gay balls reached enormous sizes, with premises filling several ballrooms with some thousands of men. And not just in Berlin, several other cities in Germany organized smaller balls for gays.\nIn the 1920s and 30s, there were uncountable bars, cafés, and dance halls in Berlin. The most elegant could be found in West Berlin, near the area formed by the Bülowstraße, the Potsdamer Straße, and the Nollendorfplatz, reaching up to the Kurfürstendamm. No doubt, the most famous was Eldorado, that really was two, one on the Lutherstraße, and a second one in the Motzstraße. Curt Moreck (Konrad Haemmerling) described it in 1931, in his \"Führer durch das „lasterhafte“ Berlin\" (\"Guide through the 'dissolute' Berlin\"), as \"an establishment of transvestites staged for the morbid fascination of the world metropolis.\" The program at the Eldorado included loud and racy shows by drag queens, addressed mostly to an heterosexual audience, that, now as then, wanted to \"satisfy their curiosity, and dared to visit the mysterious and infamous Berlin\". Moreck continues, even though he himself was encouraging, and was part of this kind of voyeuristic tourism with his travel guide:\n\nEldorado became one of the nocturnal cultural centers in Europe. The establishment hosted from bank managers to members of parliament, as well as theater actors and movie stars. Amongst them, divas like Marlene Dietrich, often with her husband Rudolf Sieber, and Anita Berber, singers like Claire Waldoff, and writers, like Wolfgang Cordan, Egon Erwin Kisch, or Josef Hora. Magnus Hirschfeld was well known there. The co-founder and commander of the SA, Ernst Röhm, was also a patron, and Karl Ernst, later a nazi politician and Gruppenführer SA, tried to survive for a time working —depending on the source— as a waiter, an employee, or a rent boy in the Eldorado of the Lutherstraße. The ballroom cum cabaret has been mentioned, directly or indirectly, serving as inspiration, in many literary works, as in \"Mr Norris Changes Trains\" (1935) and \"Goodbye to Berlin\" (1939) by Christopher Isherwood, or the memories of Erika, and Klaus Mann. The atmosphere has been captured in paintings by Otto Dix, and Ernst Fritsch.\n\nBy the end of the 1920s, the German society had taken their image of homosexuals from this kind of establishment: decadent, refined, depraved, degenerate, tightly linked to drugs, wild sex, and prostitution. The Bund für Menschenrecht tried to distance gays of this kind of milieu in 1927, but to no avail. In 1932 the chancellor Franz von Papen started a campaign against the \"depraved night of Berlin\", and in October of that same year all balls for homosexuals were prohibited. On January 30, 1933, the nazi party came to power, and on February 23, 1933, the Prussian Interior Minister ordered that all bars \"that have abused [their permit] to promote immorality\" be closed. He was referring specially to those \"that are frequented by those who pay homage to the anti-natural immorality\". On March 4, 1933, the \"Berliner Tagblatt\" informed about the closing of some establishments the day before. Of the over 100 establishments catering to homosexuals in Berlin very few survived, and those would be used to help watch and control the homosexual population.\n\nIn France, until the end of the 19th century, gays and lesbians met usually in private homes and literary salons, hidden from the public, with the Opera Ball in Paris one of the few exceptions. The Opera Ball, celebrated yearly for carnival, allowed some small leeway. The first big public ball that allowed cross dressing was the Bal Bullier in 1880, in the Avenue de l'Observatoire, followed by the Bal Wagram in 1910.\n\nAfter World War I, Paris became one of the nightlife centers in Europe, with focal points in Montmartre, Pigalle, and Montparnasse, and numerous short-lived bars catering to gays and lesbians, surviving between police raids, ruinous scandals, and the public's insatiable thirst for new thrills. Many establishments were also known for drug trafficking. Journalist Willy described the atmosphere in the bar \"The Petite Chaumière\", catering to foreigners looking for strong sensations:\n\nIn the 1920s there were several balls in the Bastille area, mainly in the Rue de Lappe, where workers, drunken sailors, and colonial soldiers gathered to dance. It wasn't strictly a homosexual milieu, but men could dance together, and you could find a partner for the night. Daniel Guérin described one of the dens as a place where \"[...] workmen, prostitutes, society women, johns, and aunties all danced. In those relaxed and natural days, before the cops took over France, a chevalier could go out in public with a mate of the same sex, without being considered crazy.» On the other hand, Willy presents a completely different aspect of the milieu, \"What you see are little delinquents, not too carefully washed but heavily made up, with caps on their heads and sporting brightly colored foulards; these are the guys who, when they fail to make a buck here, will certainly be found hauling coal or other cargo.\"\n\nThe so-called \"bal de folles\", and later \"bal de invertis\", flourished in Paris after the I World War, and even in other French cities as Toulon. In Paris, homosexuals were attracted mainly to the Bal Musette de la Montaigne de Sainte-Geneviève, in the number 46 of the Rue Montaigne de Sainte-Geneviève, where you could find gays and lesbians. Later, the big balls for carnival attracted a gay public, as the one celebrated yearly in the Magic-City, in the rue de l'Université, 180, inaugurated in 1920, and active until the prohibition on February 6, 1934. In time, the \"Carnaval interlope\" in Magic-City became a big event, visited by prominent vedette from the varietés, like Mistinguett, or Joséphine Baker, that handed over awards to the best drag queens. The Bal Wagram offered the opportunity to cross dress twice a year; at 1 a.m., the drag queens did the \"pont aux travestis\", a costume competition, doing the catwalk in front of the most selected people of Paris, that came to walk on the wild side for a night. The drag queens participating came from all walks of life, and ages, and presented a savage satire of the society, its values, and its traditional hierarchies, with images of exaggerated femininity, and masculinity: countesses dressed in crinoline, crazy virgins, oriental dancers, sailors, ruffians, or soldiers; theirs names were correspondingly colorful: Duchess of the Bubble, the Infante Eudoxie, the Mauve Mouse; the Dark One, Sweetie Pie, Fréda, the Englishwoman, Mad Maria, the Muse, the Teapot, the She-wolf, Sappho, Wet Cat, Little Piano, Princess of the Marshes, Marguerite if Burgundy, etc. Charles Étienne, in his novel \"Notre-Dame-de-Lesbos\", describes \"Didine\" in following fashion:\nMany of the onlooker just went to insult and harass the gays participating, as Charles Étienne describes in his novel \"Le Bal des folles\":\nThere are at least two instances of cross dressing balls that have been documented in England. The first one was known through a police raid of a ball celebrated in Temperance Hall, in the Hulme area of Manchester. On September 24, 1880, the chief constable of Manchester received an anonymous information about an event \"of an immoral character\" that was about to take place in the Temperance Hall of Hulme. The detective Jerome Caminada introduced two policemen dressed as women amongst those that had been gathering in the ball room after 9 p.m. Of the 47 men that congregated, all dressed in the most wild dresses, 22 as women; a pair was dressed as Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and another as Romeo and Juliet. Detective Caminada observed the ball from a neighboring roof, all young men between 20 and 30 years old, that had begun dancing about 10 p.m.; every now and then, a couple disappeared into a side room. About 1 a.m., after detective Caminada thought enough crimes had been committed, he gained entry shouting the password \"sister\" in an effeminate manner. After the door was opened, the police raided the building, and detained all participants. The trial showed that the dancers were not from Manchester, they were regulars of similar balls that were organized in several cities, as Leeds, or Nottingham. The judge, thinking about the possible scandal for the city, let them go free.\n\nDr. Matt Houlbrook, of the University of Liverpool, affirms that in the 1920s and 30s, cross dressing balls were being held secretly almost every weekend, gathering 50 to 100 men. And this, in spite of it being illegal, and being a big personal risk for those participating: they didn't just risk prison, if found out, they could loose their livelihood, be isolated socially, and finally suffer a nervous breakdown, or try suicide. In 1933 headlines informed about \"Lady Austin's Camp Boys\" scandal. The affair begun when 60 men were detained in a private ball room, in Holland Park Avenue, in London, after cross dressing police officers had been watching them dancing, made up, dressed as women, and having sex. Twenty seven men were arrested, and convicted between 3 and 20 months of jail. Even so, many stood up for their behavior, notoriously Lady Austin, who said \"There is nothing wrong [in who we are]. You call us nancies and bum boys but before long our cult will be allowed in the country.\"\n\nMid 19th century, during the reign in Isabella II, appeared the \"sociedades de baile\", \"ball societies\", mostly groups of young people that tried to rent some premises to organize a ball; but there were also other, more elegant, or pretentious, that rented theaters for their balls. The ball societies exclusively catering to gays appeared shortly after, mainly in Madrid, and Barcelona, as there were no special requirements to create one, and could be established, and broken up very easily. The most important ball society for the \"Uranian flock\" met at the El Ramillete, in the calle Alvareda, in Madrid, where you could count \"over a hundred sodomites with elegant suits, and rich jewelery\". In Barcelona, later, during the regency of Maria Christina, the biggest number of gay dancers met at the Liceo Rius.\n\nThe dancing public was off all types, but mainly transvestites and young men of the working class —workers of trade, and commerce, workshop apprentices, and servants—, for whom the balls were the highest point of their lives: exploited by their employers, and frightened of being discovered by the society. The balls allowed them to forget their situation for a couple of hours, express themselves with freedom, mingle with their equals, and, with a little luck, meet someone. Other, less fortunate, as was the case for transvestites, effeminate men, and «chulitos de barrio», neighborhood thugs, without a job, or rejected by their families, they used the balls to find their first time customers. For carnival, huge balls were celebrated, and the boys spend the whole year preparing their costumes for that important day.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, all these balls had already disappeared, and were just a memory of the past, as recounts the author Max Bembo in his book, \"La mala vida en Barcelona\" (\"The Bad Life in Barcelona\"): \"I could not find in the homosexualism of Barcelona the appearance it used to have; the parties where the baptism of homosexuals were celebrated; the very scandalous balls; the sardanapalic festivities, the shame of the city\". It's very probable that the disappearance of these public balls was due to the application of laws of public indecency, and the consequent withdrawal of the homosexual life into private residencies, and clubs.\n\nDuring the 19th century, in the United States, mainly in the Great West Frontier, there were many towns where women were few and far between. So, for cowboys, miners, loggers, or railroad workers, it was very difficult to find a woman, and marry. In these groups, men often formed intimate friendships, that sometimes ended in real love stories, that were accepted as a fact of life. It is difficult to know up to what point this was simply due to the lack of women, or if precisely this kind of life attracted those men that preferred the company of other men.\n\nIn this environment, and in the military, is where the stag dances developed, and where men danced with each other, without it having any special meaning. Beemyn talks about the stag dances celebrated in San Francisco during the gold rush, in 1849. Thousands of young men arrived to the city from all continents, converting a small frontier town into an amusement city, where everything was possible. Thanks to the lack of women, and prejudices, men had fun with each other, also dancing. In these balls, the men that took the role of the woman usually wore a handkerchief knotted around their arm, but there were also those that dressed as women.\n\nDrag balls in the United States can trace their origins to the débutante balls, and the costume parties, at the end of the 19th century. In the beginning, they were simple parties where men dressed as women, and women dressed as men could go, and where two men could dance with each other; but there are also records of more exclusive balls by the 1880s, where homosexuals —men, and women— could be counted in the hundreds, up to 500 same sex couples, that slowly waltzed the night away at the sound of an excellent orchestra. In the 1920s these balls had already become big social events in the gay and lesbian world, where —mainly men— competed for the best costume. Often, they included a \"parade of the fairies\", to show the costumes, and the participants with the most spectacular gowns received a price, in the form of money. The judges often were personalities from literature, and the show business. It was mainly in the black communities of New York City, Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans where these balls took place, sometimes bringing in white party-goers. In Manhattan, these balls got to have official permits, and police protection, and security, in places like the Webster Hall, and the Madison Square Garden, the Astor Hotel, the Manhattan Casino (later called Rockland Palace), The Harlem Alhambra, and the Savoy Ballroom in the Black Harlem, and the New Star Casino, in the Italian Harlem. The planners of these balls became well known: H. Mann in the 1910s, Kackie Mason in the 1920s, and 30s, Phil Black in the 1930s to 60s, were celebrated in many a novel. In 1933 they were described as:\n\nThe most famous drag ball was the Masquerade and Civic Ball —also known as \"Faggots Ball\" or \"Fairies Ball\"—, in New York's Harlem. The Masquerade and Civic Ball was celebration held every two years, beginning in 1869, organized by the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows, an afro-American association independent of other American fraternal orders that did not accept black men. The ball was enormously popular, attracting even white public, but that didn't stop critics, and hecklers. And in spite of there being racial tensions, gender restrictions —two men could only dance together if one of them was dressed as a woman—, and class barriers, these balls became some of the few places where black and white people could socialize, and homosexuals might even find some romance. So, one day a year, the \"faggots\", mainly the effeminates, didn't have to hide, had a place where they could feel free, leave behind their apprehension, and embrace fun without fear. In a world where homosexuals were harassed, and despised routinely, the possibility to see several thousands of them together celebrating themselves, interacting with their equals, allowed the creation of an extensive network, and an underground of mutual help. The balls were a central piece in the lives of many gays: the gowns were prepared for months before, and whatever happened there, the gossip was discussed for months after.\n\nMainly the smaller balls were the objective of police raids, that sometimes arrested those participating. The justify the arrests, they used a law from 1846 that prohibited being in disguise in public, even though it had practically only been used since the change of the century to harass transvestites. Drag balls celebrated in private establishments, and homes, even though they were somewhat safer, also were often visited by the police. By the 1930s the tension with the police had extended to the balls with official permit, signaling a change in the social mores that finally had the two last grand balls in the season 1930-31 canceled. The balls entered a definitive decadence after the derogation of the Prohibition in 1933, with the libertine culture of the speakeasies, where cross dressing was allowed, disappearing with it.\n\nIn Mexico, the biggest scandal at turn of the twentieth century was the so-called \"Dance of the Forty-One\" or \"Dance of the Forty-One Faggots\". It refers to a police raid on November 18, 1901, during the government of Porfirio Díaz, on a private home, situated in the calle de la Paz (nowadays calle Ezequiel Montes), where at that moment a group of 41 men, 22 dressed as men, and 19 as women, were celebrating a ball. The Mexican press mocked cruelly the dancers, even as the government tried to cover up the incident, as many of the participant belonged to the higher echelons of the porfirian society. The list of names was never revealed.\n\nEven though the raid did not have any legal grounds, and was completely arbitrary, the 41 detained men ended up forcefully conscripted into the military:\nThe number 41 —or 42, as it was rumored that Ignacio de la Torre, Porfirio Díaz's son-in-law, had escaped— became part of Mexico's popular culture as a way to refer to homosexuals, passive homosexuals for the number 42. The incident and the numbers were spread through press reports, but also through engravings, satires, plays, literature, and paintings; in recent years, they have even appeared on television, in the historical telenovela \"El vuelo del águila\", first broadcast by Televisa in 1994. In 1906 Eduardo A. Castrejón published a book titled \"Los cuarenta y uno. Novela crítico-social\". José Guadalupe Posada's engravings alluding to the affair are famous, and were frequently published alongside satirical verses:\n\nThe Argentine tango, as a dance, was developed by the end of the 20th century among men, and by men that danced with other men in streets and brothels:\n\nAt the beginning of the 1910s the tango was discovered by Europeans, and became fashionable in Paris, but as a dance between man and woman, in a more \"decent\" style, without \"cortes y quebradas\". Historical postcards of the 1920s and 30s also show women dancing tango. But these postcards come from cabarets in Paris, and have a particularly masculine, and voyeur accent.\n\nIn Brazil, homosexuality was legalized in 1830, and kept it legal in the new penal code of 1890. But there were many different laws about public indecency, vagrancy, transvestism, or \"libertine\" behavior that were used to control, and repress homosexuals. But once a year, during the Carnival, the social mores relaxed, allowing transvestism, and dancing among men —and womwan—, beginning in the 1930s. The costumes in the Rio Carnival became more and more elaborate, and a jury begun to give prizes to the best; these shows evolved into full balls, where only 10% of the dancers were dressed as drag queens.\n\nThere are reports of gay balls (\"baly zhenonenavistnikov\", literally \"balls of woman-haters\") in Russia before the I World War, specifically in Moscow. These balls, even though they were celebrated in the \"zhenonenavistnik\" (\"woman-haters\") subculture, a hyper-masculine group of homosexuals, also accepted cross-dressers.\nIn 2013 a photograph (to the right) was published for the first time: it depicts a group of cross-dressed men from Petrograd that were celebrating a drag party on February 15, 1921, during the first years of the Soviet regime. The photo was taken by the forensic experts of the police that had raided the party being held in a private apartment, after receiving an anonymous tip-off about \"antinatural activities\" in a house in the Simeon street, number 6. Ninety-eight sailors, soldiers, and civilians were arrested —even though sodomy had been legalized in 1917. They had met to celebrate a \"transvestite wedding\", many dressed in feminine gowns, \"Spanish dresses\", and \"white wigs\", to dance the waltz and the minuet, and socialize with other men. The responsible Justice Commissar justified the raid saying that a public show of homosexual tendencies could endanger \"non mature personalities\". Even though none of the participants were condemned, the owner of the apartment was accused of running a brothel, according to article 171 of the Soviet penal code, a felony that could be punished with up to three years of prison, and confiscation of all, or some of the property.\n\nBalls for lesbians were also quite common, even though not so much as male ones. Not only were they less in number, but there is less information about them, a problem common to all lesbian history. On the other hand, in western societies, two woman dancing together publicly is still acceptable nowadays, and can be done without any suspicions of lesbianism.\n\nIn Mexico, on December 4, 1901, shortly after the raid to the Dance of the Forty-One, there was also a police raid of a lesbian ball in Santa María, but the incident had a much smaller social impact than the male equivalent.\n\nHirschfeld, in his book \"Berlins drittes Geschlecht\" (1904), talks also about lesbian balls:\n\nLater in Germany, the \"bowling club\" \"Die lustige Neun\" (\"The Funny Nine\"\"), created in Berlin in 1924, continued organizing lesbian balls with 200 to 300 women at least until April 1940. It is unknown if the balls, known thanks to the descriptions in the Gestapo files, continued throughout the war years; fact is, the track is lost.\n\nIn Switzerland, even with many difficulties, the homosexual movement kept its structures over the war. \"The Circle\", a gay magazine, organized weekly club evenings in Zürich, that only subscribers could visit. Several elaborate systems were used to secure the anonymity of the participants, and only \"Rolf\", the editor of the magazine, had the names and addresses of everyone. For spring, summer, and fall big balls were organized, and there was also a big costume ball for carnival. An important effort was done to keep everything decent, respectable, and contained, and Rolf made sure that no man under 20 was present. This secrecy mentality was no longer acceptable to gays by the mid-1960s, and in 1967 the magazine and its organization disappeared.\n\nIn France, during the occupation of Paris, all balls were prohibited, a situation that did not change after the allies entered the city. During the war, the only possibility was to meet in the outskirts of Paris, as gays did on the Christmas eve of 1935, when hundreds of men traveled 50 km in a bus from Paris to celebrate the traditional dinner. After the war, the only possibility was to travel by train to the Bal de la Chervrière, in L'Étang-la-Ville, Yvelines, an establishment owned by a lesbian, \"la Colonelle\", that had been part of the resistance, and had enough contacts to keep her place open. The situation improved with the reopening of the Bal de la montaigne de Sainte-Geneviève in 1954, organized by Georges Anys, who would keep it open until the 1960s. Possibly the most important ball was the one celebrated every Sunday evening by the magazine and association Arcadie, the Cespala (Club littéraire et scientifique des pays latins), in the number 9 of the Rue Béranger, reserved exclusively to the members of the club.\n\nThere was a short revival of the gay pre-war scene after the war in Germany. The Walterchens Ballhaus organized drag balls already in 1946, and the parties at Prince Sasha's were one of the centers of gay nightlife. In Frankfurt, in 1949 reopened the bar Fellsenkeller; the bar had a police permit that allowed men to dance together. By the beginning of the 1950s this revival had been thoroughly eliminated, and gay subculture had disappeared.\n\nAfter the war, Amsterdam became something of a gay mecca: the biggest gay dance hall in Europe was DOK (De Odeon Kelder), initially belonging to the COC (Cultuur en Ontspanningscentrum, \"Center for Culture and Leisure\"), it became independent under the direction of Lou Charité three years after. The COC opened then another dance club, De Shakel (\"The Chain Link\"). The city was quite accepting of these clubs, and gay men from all around the world traveled there for the opportunity to dance freely with other men.\n\nThe struggles of the homophile movement to resist the pressure of society and the authorities, trying to gain respectability, and acceptance by passing, but at the same time tying to accommodate the need to socialize, and vent for gay men, can be illustrated by the Café 't Mandje: a small den in gay-accepting Amsterdam's Red-Light District, where prostitutes, pimps, seamen, gays and lesbians came openly together, allowed the dancing of two men only on the Queen's Birthday, once a year, as it did not have a dancing license. Another example is the origin of the Balletti Verdi affair (\"green ballet\"): a series of private parties in Castel Mella, organized by two homosexuals for their friends, became a political scandal of enormous proportions in the Province of Brescia in 1960 when it was discovered that minors —between 18 and 21 years old— had participated. Additionally, the fact that there had been some prostitution going on had disastrous consequences for all the participants, most of them innocent, and ended with three suicides, one man fleeing the city, and many losing their jobs. A subsequent witch hunt against gays in Italy covered the whole land. As late as 1973, in the last years of Franco's dictatorship, ten men were arrested in Sitges, Spain, for going out dancing in women's clothes. The press published their photos in drag, and made snide comments for days, calling them all kinds of names.\n\nIn the U.S., cross dressing balls evolved into the ballroom community, or ball culture, that started in the Harlem, and in Washington, D.C., in the 1960s.\nSoon the balls were divided in \"houses\", or \"families\", lead by a charismatic figure.\nThe ballroom community is still active, as has been documented in the film \"Paris Is Burning\" (1990). It has had a notable influence, mainly through Madonna's Vogue video, where the dancers use the vogue dancing style, developed in the ball culture, imitating the movements of models on the catwalk. Beyoncé has also mentioned she was influenced by the ball culture, \"how inspired she's been by the whole drag-house circuit in the States, an unsung part of black American culture where working-class gay men channel ultra-glamour in mocked-up catwalk shows. 'I still have that in me', she says of the 'confidence and the fire you see on stage [...]'\".\n\nAfter the Stonewall riots, and the appearance of the modern LGBT liberation movement, these extensive cross-dressing balls, as they had been celebrated until then, practically disappeared. There are a few notable exceptions, as the Life Ball in Vienna, celebrated yearly since 1992, or the annual Night of a Thousand Gowns in New York City, organized by the Imperial Court System, but in general they have been substituted by the dance club.\n\nBy the mid 1970s, initially in New York City, appeared the discotheque, with the corresponding disco music, and disc jockeys, in close relationship with the gay scene —see for example Studio 54. Discotheques, and their music soon became favorites of gay men, who found in its songs gay anthems, as \"It's raining men\", \"Y.M.C.A.\", \"I'm coming out\", or \"So many men, so little time\", in spite of the homophobia of some of the divas singing. Mid 1980s appears the clubbing subculture, with centers in New York City, Ibiza, London, and Paris; one of its most iconic clubs being the Sound Factory in New York City. These clubs usually offered electronic dance music to big masses of gay men. By the end of the decade, and the beginning of the 1990s, the circuit parties appear: big, outdoors parties, similar to raves, very planned, that can go on for days, and that can draw patrons from a very large territory, even from other countries. Some circuit parties, like the White Party in Palm Springs, the Black and Blue Party in Montreal, and the Winter Party in Miami, attract gay men in the thousands, and the ten thousands. In Europe, the biggest circuit party is celebrated in Barcelona, with about 70,000 men participating.\n"}

It is not discernible which was released first; most likely Aristophanes had heard an early form of the \"Republic\" before it was completed and used it as the basis for \"Assemblywomen\". Certainly, the similarities have long been commented upon.\n\nThomas More, when writing his \"Utopia\", invented the technique of using the portrayal of a \"utopia\" as the carrier of his thoughts about the ideal society. In Thomas More's Utopia, the island Utopia is also similar to Plato's \"Republic\" in some aspects, among them common property and the lack of privacy.\n\nThe form of government described in the \"Republic\" has been adapted in several modern dystopic novels and stories. The separation of people by professional class, assignment of profession and purpose by the state, and the absence of traditional family units, replaced by state-organized breeding, was included by authors in descriptions of totalitarian dystopic governments. Government which bears resemblance to Plato's \"Republic\" is found in Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" and Lois Lowry's \"The Giver\".\n\nThe Orwellian dystopia depicted in the novel \"1984\" had many characteristics in common with Plato's description of the allegory of the Cave as Winston Smith strives to liberate himself from it.\n\nAnother satiric presentation of Platonic style government would be Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers. His citizen can be compared to a Platonic Guardian, without the communal breeding and property, but still having a militaristic base. Although there are significant differences in the specifics of the system, Heinlein and Plato both describe systems of limited franchise, with a political class that has supposedly earned their power and wisely governs the whole. \"Republic\" is specifically attacked in \"Starship Troopers\". Indeed, the arachnids can be seen as much closer to a \"Republic\" society than the humans.\n\nAlthough not directly referenced at any point the \"Mega City One\" of 2000AD's Judge Dredd storyline has broad similarities to the Platonic Republic – mainly in that it is governed by a Guardian Class (the Judges) raised from infancy to govern in the interests of the polity and bound by far stricter rules than apply to the common citizen.\n\nThe comic book Morning Glories takes place at a violent and secretive boarding school which is built on the grounds above Plato's Cave.\n\nThe experience of Jack in Emma Donoghue's 2010 novel \"Room\" contains many similarities to the experience of the people in Plato's Cave.\n\n\n"}

London was inspired to write stories by various adventurers he met. \"The Thousand Dozen\" for instance was inspired by a brief market corner on eggs created by \"Swiftwater\" Bill Gates. Part I of Jack London's 1910 novel \"Burning Daylight\" is centered on the Klondike Gold Rush. Another literary luminary connected with the rush, and whose cabin still stands in Dawson City, was folk-lyricist Robert W. Service, whose short epics The Shooting of Dan McGrew and other works describe the fierce grandeur of the north and the survival ethic and gold fever of men and women in the frozen, gold-strewn north. Service's best-known line is the opening of The Cremation of Sam McGee, which goes;\n\nOne of the last books of Jules Verne, \"Le Volcan d'Or\" (\"The Volcano of Gold\"), deals with the terrible hardships endured by the gold-seekers in the Klondike. The book was written circa 1899 but was not published until 1989.\n\nJames A. Michener's novel \"Alaska\" (chapter VIII) and his short novel \"Journey\" describe the harsh realities of the Klondike Gold Rush using fictional characters.\n\nCanadian author Vicki Delany writes the Klondike Gold Rush series of mystery novels from Dundurn Press, which include Gold Digger (2009) and Gold Fever (2010) and Gold Mountain (May 2012)\n\nCharlie Chaplin's silent film \"The Gold Rush\" (1925), the highest grossing silent comedy, was set in the Klondike, as was the silent epic \"The Trail of '98\" (1928) and Mae West's \"Klondike Annie\" (1936). A silent-era film by Russian director Lev Kuleshov \"By the Law\" (1926), based on Jack London's story \"The Unexpected\" also dramatizes the life of the gold-seekers.\n\nThe 1946 comedy, \"Road to Utopia\" is set during the Rush. \n\nLife in Dawson City during the gold rush was also the subject of the award-winning 1957 National Film Board of Canada (NFB) documentary \"City of Gold\", narrated by Pierre Berton.\n\nThe 1955 film\"The Far Country\" is a Western set in Skagway and Dawson City during the gold rush era. It was directed by Anthony Mann and written by Borden Chase. The 1978 TV special \"What a Nightmare, Charlie Brown!\" is also set during the Gold Rush but is disputed to be the 1925 serum run to Nome.\n\nThe Irish language TV series \"An Klondike\" (2015) also takes place during the Rush.\n\nThe \"Klondyke march and two step\" with music by Oscar Telgmann was published in Kingston, Ontario by the Music Emporium, c. 1897.\nDawson City was also the starting place of impresario Alexander Pantages. He opened a small theater to entertain the miners. He also became the partner and lover of \"Klondike Kate\" Rockwell. Soon, however, his activities expanded and he became one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons.\n\nThe song \"Gold Dust\" by Canadian independent artist Right On Yukon makes multiple references to the hardships endured by fortune seekers and animals along the White Pass trail from Skagway to Dawson.\n\nCarl Barks' 1950s Scrooge McDuck comics established the character as a successful participant in the Klondike rush when he was young, around the turn of the century. While Barks was content with leaving Scrooge's backstory of his Klondike days at the level of short flashbacks, his successor Don Rosa has gone to extend Barks's legacy of short glimpses into Scrooge's gold rush exploits into a number of adventure stories, particularly \"Last Sled to Dawson\" and individual chapters of his opus magnum \"The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck\", which are chapter 8a: \"King of the Klondike\", chapter 8b: \"The Prisoner of White Agony Creek\", and chapter 8c: \"Hearts of the Yukon\".\n\nSoapy Smith is the villain in the Lucky Luke album \"Le Klondike\", by Morris, Yann and Jean Léturgie. The story features Smith's saloon and fake telegraph, but set in Dawson rather than Skagway.\n\nLefty Frizzell's 1964 song \"Saginaw, Michigan\" tells the tale of a poor fisherman who feigns the discovery of Klondike gold in a plot to remove the hostile father of the woman he loves.\n\nA game called The Yukon Trail was created by MECC in 1994. There is also a populaire solitaire called Klondike.\n\nIn addition, the Klondike gold rush proved to be one of the most famous eras of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's history. Not only did the exemplary conduct of the force ensure its continuation at a time when its dissolution was being debated in the Parliament of Canada, but the Force's depiction in popular western culture is often set at this time. The most popular examples include dramatic depictions such as the radio series \"Challenge of the Yukon\" and comedic ones like \"Dudley Do-Right\".\n\nA certain amount of slang came out of the gold rush. Experienced miners were often known as Sourdoughs. Potential miners new to the Klondike were known as Cheechakos, from Chinook Jargon. These two names live on in Dawson City, in tourist literature, and enjoy occasional usage by miners still working the tributaries of the Yukon River and Klondike River as well as in literature relating to the Klondike gold rush era.\n\nThe gold rush was celebrated in the city of Edmonton, Alberta, with Klondike Days (now simply K-Days), an annual summer fair with a Klondike gold rush theme. Although far away from Dawson City and the Klondike River, Edmonton became known as a \"Gateway to the North\" for gold prospectors en route to Canada's North. It was in the city that many would collect the necessary goods for trekking up north in search of wealth. Individuals and teams of explorers arrived in Edmonton and prepared for travel by foot, York boat, dog team, or horses. Travel to the Yukon over land via what was sometimes called the \"all Canada\" route—and the prospectors that took this route—were often referred to as \"overlanders\". Few overlanders made it to the Klondike (160 out of about 1,600 that started).\n\nAlberta's Northlands Association, which is based in Edmonton, honoured the memory and spirit of the overlanders with Klondike Days. For many years, Klondike Days was a fun summer exhibition with themed events such as the Sunday Promenade, the Sourdough raft race, free pancake breakfasts, saloons, gold panning and era costume parties. Despite the many sad realities of the gold rush, Edmonton appreciated the Klondike spirit, which was characterised by a tenacious hope for success in the face of hardship, and an energetic zest for life. As a fair theme it was meant to provide the impetus for fun fantasy characters (e.g., Klondike Mike (Bobby Breen), Klondike Kate, The Klondike Kid (Ken Armstrong), Klondike Kitty (Debra Cook), Klondike Kattie to mention but a few) and fun events celebrating an interesting time. Many in the Yukon resented Edmonton's Klondike celebrations because of their historical inaccuracy and the perceived competition with the Yukon's tourism. The sentimental aspect of the gold rush lost its popular appeal in the 1980s and 90s and in 2003 the theme was dropped.\n\nIn addition, every other summer, on odd numbered years, the sleep away camp Camp Shohola for Boys has what it calls Klondike Day. In the morning an area of camp, including the creek that runs through the camp, are staged as Dawson City and campers run into the creek to search for \"gold.\" In the afternoon they receive \"money\" for their prospecting and attend a camp wide carnival.\n\n"}

This may be a formal situation, such as the establishment of a school for the deaf, or informal, such as migration to cities for employment and the subsequent gathering of deaf people for social purposes. \nAn example of the first is Nicaraguan Sign Language, which emerged when deaf children in Nicaragua were brought together for the first time, and received only oral education; of the latter, Bamako Sign Language, which emerged among the tea circles of the uneducated deaf in the capital of Mali. Nicaraguan SL is now a language of instruction and is recognized as the national sign language; Bamako SL is not, and is threatened by the use of American Sign Language in schools for the deaf. \n\nDeaf-community sign languages contrast with village sign language in that they tend to be used only by the deaf, at least at first, and most communication is between deaf people. Village sign languages, on the other hand, develop in relatively isolated areas with high incidences of congenital deafness, where most hearing people have deaf family, so that most signers are hearing. These differences have linguistic consequences. Urban deaf communities lack the common knowledge and social context that enables village signers to communicate without being verbally explicit. Deaf-community signers need to communicate with strangers, and therefore must be more explicit; it is thought this may have the effect of developing or at least speeding up the development of grammatical and other linguistic structures in the emerging language. For example, only deaf-community sign languages are known to make abstract and grammatical use of sign space. Both types of deaf sign language differ from speech-taboo languages such as the various Aboriginal Australian sign languages, which are developed by the hearing community and only used secondarily by the deaf, and are not independent languages.\n\nDeaf-community languages may develop directly from home sign, or perhaps from idioglossic sign (in families with more than one deaf child), as was the case with Nicaraguan SL, or they may develop from village sign languages, as appears to have been at least partially the case with American SL, which arose in a school for the deaf where French Sign Language was the language of instruction, but seems to have derived largely from two or three village sign languages of the students.\n\nOnce a sign language is established, especially if it is a language of education, it may spread and spawn additional languages, such as in the French Sign Language family. The following are languages thought to have been established in new deaf communities, without the direct transmission of an existing sign language. There are presumably others; with many sign languages, we have no records of how they formed.\n\n\nOther locally developed sign languages which may have formed this way are:\n\n"}

Its plot, loosely based on the crimes of Ed Gein, follows Ezra Cobb, a middle-aged man in a rural Midwestern community who begins a string of serial murders and grave robberies after the death of his mother, a religious fanatic who raised him to be a misogynist. Though based on Gein, the film's title is misleading since Gein never experimented with necrophilia; although a necrophile is also defined as \"an obsessive fascination with death and corpses.\"\n\nFunded by an American concert promoter on a small budget, the production took place in Oshawa, Ontario in the winter of 1973, with a largely Canadian cast and crew. The film premiered in Los Angeles on March 20, 1974. \n\nMiddle-aged Ezra Cobb helps operate a farm in the rural Midwest with his elderly mother, Amanda, a religious fanatic who has indoctrinated him since childhood to abhor women. Amanda dies following a protracted illness, and Ezra withdraws. Nearly a year after her death, he experiences auditory hallucinations that compel him to exhume his mother. He arrives at her grave one night and digs up her decomposed body, returning it to his home where he cobbles it together using discarded fish skin and wax.\n\nEzra becomes acquainted with Maureen Selby, an eccentric middle-aged woman and proclaimed psychic. One night during a preemptive sexual encounter, he murders her, an event that sets him off on a chain of serial killings. He first sets his attention on a 34-year-old waitress, Mary Ransum, whom he becomes acquainted with. He slashes her tires one night, leaving her stranded at the restaurant after-hours, and then appears under the guise of offering her a ride. She reluctantly agrees to ride with him to his house, where he says he has spare tires. After waiting in the truck for an extended period of time, Mary goes to look for him. In the house, she finds Ezra in a bedroom surrounded by the corpses of his mother and others, his face obscured with a mask made of human flesh. She attempts to flee, but he incapacitates her.\n\nLater, Mary awakens bound in a closet, wearing only undergarments. Ezra escorts her to the dining room, where he seats her at a table surrounded by corpses. He becomes aroused and begins molesting her, during which she convinces him to free her arms. She manages to smash a bottle over his head, but he beats her to death with a human femur bone. A short time later, Ezra visits his friend, Harlon, at his house, and discusses Mary's disappearances. In conversation, Ezra references her \"being over at his place,\" a comment Harlon takes in jest. Harlon's teenage son, Brad, arrives with his girlfriend, Sally Mae, who immediately catches Ezra's interest. He later visits her while she works her cashier job at a local store, and shoots her with a rifle; the bullet grazes her head, but does not kill her.\n\nEzra places Sally Mae in the bed of his truck and drives away, but she awakens and escapes on foot, fleeing into the woods. She inadvertently runs over a bear trap earlier set by Harlon and Brad. The trap mangles her foot, and she attempts to hide amidst the underbrush, but Ezra finds her and shoots her to death. Harlon and Brad return to the store and find blood and broken glasses at the cash register, but no sign of Sally Mae; Brad recalls to the sheriff that Ezra was the last person he saw at the store.\n\nEzra brings Sally Mae's corpse to his farm, where he hangs it upside down in the barn and begins skinning the body. Harlon, Brad, and the sheriff arrive and find him in his kitchen, laughing over a bowl of blood.\n\n\n\"Deranged\" is presented as a true story, and features a unique narrative method in which Tom Simms, a reporter who purportedly covered the events depicted in the film, narrates onscreen, sometimes appearing within the diegesis of individual sequences. \n\nPrincipal photography took place over a period of two months between February and March 1973 in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, on a budget of $200,000. Producer Tom Karr, who had been fascinated with Ed Gein for many years, funded the film himself with income he had earned as a concert promoter for Led Zeppelin and Three Dog Night. The Canadian location was chosen to ensure the film achieved a wintry setting. Locations used included an abandoned farmhouse, a local hardware store, and a basement location in the hotel in which the cast and crew were lodging. The majority of interior scenes were shot on sets constructed at a local motion picture studio.\n\nThe film's art director, Albert Fisher, dressed the sets with stacks of crime serials and pornographic magazines; Fisher garnered inspiration by reading newspaper stories about Ed Gein and his crimes.\n\nIn order to achieve an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), several sequences were truncated or excised entirely. Among these included an extended murder sequence involving Mary, as well as a protracted dissection sequence in which Ezra mutilates a corpse.\n\n\"Deranged\" had its theatrical premiere in Los Angeles, California on March 20, 1974.\nIn 2002, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released \"Deranged\" as part of its \"Midnite Movies\" collection of double feature DVDs. It was released along with the 1980 feature film \"Motel Hell\". A second release of the film was also made available in the United States on DVD from Desert Island Classics on March 5, 2014.\n\nIn 2007, Germany released a 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition. Where the U.S. DVD received a cut R-rating, the German version is unrated and uncut, with a brain-scooping scene which is cut from the U.S. version, it is also in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, with both an English and German (dubbed) audio track and optional English and German subtitles.\n\n\"Deranged\" was released on Blu-ray format in the United Kingdom via Arrow Films on August 19, 2013, which contains both a Blu-ray and DVD of the film. The film was released on Blu-ray in the United States on July 7, 2015 by Kino Lorber distribution.\n\n\"Time Out\"'s review of the film was mostly positive, writing, \"The more sensationalist aspects of the story are admirably underplayed, and Blossom's nicely gauged performance lends the film surprising conviction.\" \"TV Guide\" awarded the film three out of five stars, praising Blossom's performance and calling it \"an accurately recounted horror film inspired by the life of crazed Wisconsin farmer Ed Gein, who actually murdered, skinned and preserved body parts of dozens of women in the late 1950s... A sick little film but told with a disturbing sense of humor.\" Justin Remer from DVD Talk gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars, writing, \"\"Deranged\" is a cult classic that deserves a massively larger cult. Its performances are surprisingly vivid and realistic, its script is smart and subtly funny, its gore is stomach-churning, and its suspense scenes are genuinely nerve-jangling.\" \n\nDonald Guarisco of AllMovie wrote: \"\"Deranged\" is interesting because it as witty as it is scary. The film suffers from rough edges, the main problems being inconsistent pacing and a stilted framing device involving an investigative reporter, but remains compelling because it adds some perceptive social satire into the mix.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1971728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971728", "title": "Fall guy", "text": "Fall guy\n\nFall guy is a colloquial phrase that refers to a person to whom blame is deliberately and falsely attributed in order to deflect blame from another party.\n\nThe origin of the term \"fall guy\" is unknown and contentious. Many sources place its origin in the early 20th century, while some claim an earlier origin. In April 2007, William Safire promoted a search to unearth its origins.\n\nFour slightly different usages for \"fall guy\" survive and their origins are probably different. These usages are:\n\n\nThe phrase may have multiple, separate origins. Criminal usage goes back to the original sense of \"felon\" (derived from fallen, morally).\n\n\nVarious sources attribute the origin of fall guy to Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot. This has been largely discredited.\n\nOne popular myth is that the word's origin dates to the 1920s, during the administration of U.S. President Warren G. Harding (1921–1923), when Albert B. Fall, a U.S. Senator from New Mexico who served as Secretary of the Interior during Harding's years in office, became notorious for his involvement in the infamous Teapot Dome Scandal. Though this is a popular story, references to 'fall guy' and Albert Fall have not been found. The book \"The Tempest Over Teapot Dome\" contains no references to \"fall guy\". A \"Time\" article from the period makes no reference to \"fall guys\", although the scandal may have had yet to fully play out. However, this event may have popularized the phrase (via post-hoc eponymy).\n\nLegitimization occurred in the 1940s, primarily with the meaning of \"take on work/responsibility\". A paper on \"Isolationism is not dead\" quotes an anonymous editorial from a paper in the Pacific Northwest on the topic of the Bretton Woods and the Food Conferences upon which the US became the \"fall guy, the one to carry the load\". By 1950 in the context of unions and industrial society, the term referred to the low man on the totem pole, to whom the unpleasant tasks would be assigned, specifically that of filling out questionnaires.\n\nBy the 1950s and 1960s, \"fall guy\" came to mean public \"whipping boy\" in the abstract, metaphorical sense. In a 1960 paper called the \"Politics of Pollution\", Robert Bulard writes public officials, to deflect criticism over landfills, found a \"fall guy\", but they blamed abstract, faceless bodies: \"the federal government, state governments and private disposal companies\" rather than an individual. Other abstract 'fall guys' included the railroad and bank capital. Use of the political \"fall guy\" is exemplified in the following three events:\n\nIn corporate managerial classes, by 1988 the \"fall guy\" was institutionalized as a principle, a component of what every good manager needed.\n\nA few examples of fall guys:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11185", "title": "Feminism", "text": "Feminism\n\nFeminism is a range of political movements, ideologies, and social movements that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social equality of sexes. This includes seeking to establish educational and professional opportunities for women that are equal to those for men.\n\nFeminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women's rights, including the right to vote, to hold public office, to work, to earn fair wages or equal pay, to own property, to receive education, to enter contracts, to have equal rights within marriage, and to have maternity leave. Feminists have also worked to ensure access to legal abortions and social integration, and to protect women and girls from rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part of feminist movements.\n\nSome scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender neutrality in English, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including bell hooks, argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles.\nFeminist theory, which emerged from feminist movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experience; it has developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender.\n\nNumerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years and represent different viewpoints and aims. Some forms of feminism have been criticized for taking into account only white, middle class, and college-educated perspectives. This criticism led to the creation of ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism, including black feminism and intersectional feminism.\n\nCharles Fourier, a Utopian Socialist and French philosopher, is credited with having coined the word \"féminisme\" in 1837. The words \"féminisme\" (\"feminism\") and \"féministe\" (\"feminist\") first appeared in France and the Netherlands in 1872, Great Britain in the 1890s, and the United States in 1910, and the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" lists 1852 as the year of the first appearance of \"feminist\" and 1895 for \"feminism\". Depending on the historical moment, culture and country, feminists around the world have had different causes and goals. Most western feminist historians contend that all movements working to obtain women's rights should be considered feminist movements, even when they did not (or do not) apply the term to themselves. Other historians assert that the term should be limited to the modern feminist movement and its descendants. Those historians use the label \"protofeminist\" to describe earlier movements.\n\nThe history of the modern western feminist movements is divided into three \"waves\". Each wave dealt with different aspects of the same feminist issues. The first wave comprised women's suffrage movements of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, promoting women's right to vote. The second wave was associated with the ideas and actions of the women's liberation movement beginning in the 1960s. The second wave campaigned for legal and social equality for women. The third wave is a continuation of, and a reaction to, the perceived failures of second-wave feminism, which began in the 1990s.\n\nFirst-wave feminism was a period of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made with the passing of legislation such as the UK Custody of Infants Act 1839 which introduced the Tender years doctrine for child custody arrangement and gave woman the right of custody of their children for the first time. Other legislation such as the Married Women's Property Act 1870 in the UK and extended in the 1882 Act, these became models for similar legislation in other British territories. For example, Victoria passed legislation in 1884, New South Wales in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive, and economic rights as well.\n\nWomen's suffrage (the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office) began in Britain's Australasian colonies at the close of the 19th century, with the self-governing colonies of New Zealand granting women the right to vote in 1893 and South Australia granting female suffrage in 1895. This was followed by Australia granting female suffrage in 1902.\n\nIn Britain the Suffragettes and the Suffragists campaigned for the women's vote, and in 1918 the Representation of the People Act was passed granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned property. In 1928 this was extended to all women over 21. Emmeline Pankhurst was the most notable activist in England, with \"Time\" naming her one of the stating: \"she shaped an idea of women for our time; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back.\" In the U.S., notable leaders of this movement included Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony, who each campaigned for the abolition of slavery prior to championing women's right to vote. These women were influenced by the Quaker theology of spiritual equality, which asserts that men and women are equal under God. In the United States, first-wave feminism is considered to have ended with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1919), granting women the right to vote in all states. The term \"first wave\" was coined retroactively to categorize these western movements after the term \"second-wave feminism\" began to be used to describe a newer feminist movement that focused on fighting social and cultural inequalities, as well political inequalities.\n\nDuring the late Qing period and reform movements such as the Hundred Days' Reform, Chinese feminists called for women's liberation from traditional roles and Neo-Confucian gender segregation. Later, the Chinese Communist Party created projects aimed at integrating women into the workforce, and claimed that the revolution had successfully achieved women's liberation.\n\nAccording to Nawar al-Hassan Golley, Arab feminism was closely connected with Arab nationalism. In 1899, Qasim Amin, considered the \"father\" of Arab feminism, wrote \"The Liberation of Women\", which argued for legal and social reforms for women. He drew links between women's position in Egyptian society and nationalism, leading to the development of Cairo University and the National Movement. In 1923 Hoda Shaarawi founded the Egyptian Feminist Union, became its president and a symbol of the Arab women's rights movement.\n\nThe Iranian Constitutional Revolution in 1905 triggered the Iranian women's movement, which aimed to achieve women's equality in education, marriage, careers, and legal rights. However, during the Iranian revolution of 1979, many of the rights that women had gained from the women's movement were systematically abolished, such as the Family Protection Law.\n\nIn France, women obtained the right to vote only with the Provisional Government of the French Republic of 21 April 1944. The Consultative Assembly of Algiers of 1944 proposed on 24 March 1944 to grant eligibility to women but following an amendment by Fernand Grenier, they were given full citizenship, including the right to vote. Grenier's proposition was adopted 51 to 16. In May 1947, following the November 1946 elections, the sociologist Robert Verdier minimized the \"gender gap\", stating in \"Le Populaire\" that women had not voted in a consistent way, dividing themselves, as men, according to social classes. During the baby boom period, feminism waned in importance. Wars (both World War I and World War II) had seen the provisional emancipation of some women, but post-war periods signalled the return to conservative roles.\n\nBy the mid 20th century, in some European countries, women still lacked some significant rights. Feminists in these countries continued to fight for voting rights. In Switzerland, women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971; but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the women's suffrage referendum of 1984. Three prior referendums held in 1968, 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women's right to vote.\nFeminists continued to campaign for the reform of family laws which gave husbands control over their wives. Although by the 20th century coverture had been abolished in the UK and the US, in many continental European countries married women still had very few rights. For instance, in France married women did not receive the right to work without their husband's permission until 1965. Feminists have also worked to abolish the \"marital exemption\" in rape laws which precluded the prosecution of husbands for the rape of their wives. Earlier efforts by first-wave feminists such as Voltairine de Cleyre, Victoria Woodhull and Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy to criminalize marital rape in the late 19th century had failed; this was only achieved a century later in most Western countries, but is still not achieved in many other parts of the world.\n\nFrench philosopher Simone de Beauvoir provided a Marxist solution and an existentialist view on many of the questions of feminism with the publication of \"Le Deuxième Sexe\" (\"The Second Sex\") in 1949. The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice. Second-wave feminism is a feminist movement beginning in the early 1960s and continuing to the present; as such, it coexists with third-wave feminism. Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending gender discrimination.\n\nSecond-wave feminists see women's cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked and encourage women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and as reflecting sexist power structures. The feminist activist and author Carol Hanisch coined the slogan \"The Personal is Political\", which became synonymous with the second wave.\n\nSecond- and third-wave feminism in China has been characterized by a reexamination of women's roles during the communist revolution and other reform movements, and new discussions about whether women's equality has actually been fully achieved.\n\nIn 1956, President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt initiated \"state feminism\", which outlawed discrimination based on gender and granted women's suffrage, but also blocked political activism by feminist leaders. During Sadat's presidency, his wife, Jehan Sadat, publicly advocated further women's rights, though Egyptian policy and society began to move away from women's equality with the new Islamist movement and growing conservatism. However, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, Islamic feminism, which argues for women's equality within an Islamic framework.\n\nIn Latin America, revolutions brought changes in women's status in countries such as Nicaragua, where feminist ideology during the Sandinista Revolution aided women's quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change.\n\nIn 1963, Betty Friedan's book \"The Feminine Mystique\" was published and helped voice the discontent that American women felt. The book is widely credited with sparking the beginning of second-wave feminism in the United States. The book's success also meant that Friedan could lecture her views while she was on tour in 1970. Within ten years, after Friedan's successful publishing, women made up more than half of the total percentage in the First World workforce.\n\nThird-wave feminism is traced to the emergence of the Riot grrrl feminist punk subculture in Olympia, Washington, in the early 1990s, and to Anita Hill's televised testimony in 1991—to an all-male, all-white Senate Judiciary Committee—that Clarence Thomas, nominated for the Supreme Court of the United States, had sexually harassed her. The term \"third wave\" is credited to Rebecca Walker, who responded to Thomas's appointment to the Supreme Court with an article in \"Ms.\" magazine, \"Becoming the Third Wave\" (1992). She wrote:\n\nThird-wave feminism also sought to challenge or avoid what it deemed the second wave's essentialist definitions of femininity, which, third-wave feminists argued, over-emphasized the experiences of upper middle-class white women. Third-wave feminists often focused on \"micro-politics\" and challenged the second wave's paradigm as to what was, or was not, good for women, and tended to use a post-structuralist interpretation of gender and sexuality. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave, such as Gloria Anzaldúa, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, Cherríe Moraga, Audre Lorde, Maxine Hong Kingston, and many other non-white feminists, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities. Third-wave feminism also contained internal debates between difference feminists, who believe that there are important psychological differences between the sexes, and those who believe that there are no inherent psychological differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to social conditioning.\n\nStandpoint theory is a feminist theoretical point of view that believes a persons' social position influences their knowledge. This perspective argues that research and theory treats women and the feminist movement as insignificant and refuses to see traditional science as unbiased. Since the 1980s, standpoint feminists have argued that the feminist movement should address global issues (such as rape, incest, and prostitution) and culturally specific issues (such as female genital mutilation in some parts of Africa and Arab societies, as well as glass ceiling practices that impede women's advancement in developed economies) in order to understand how gender inequality interacts with racism, homophobia, classism and colonization in a \"matrix of domination\".\n\nFourth-wave feminism refers to a resurgence of interest in feminism that began around 2012 and is associated with the use of social media. According to feminist scholar Prudence Chamberlain, the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to sexual harassment and violence against women. Its essence, she writes, is \"incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist\".\n\nFourth-wave feminism is \"defined by technology\", according to Kira Cochrane, and is characterized particularly by the use of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Tumblr, and blogs such as Feministing to challenge misogyny and further gender equality.\n\nIssues that fourth-wave feminists focus on include street and workplace harassment, campus sexual assault and rape culture. Scandals involving the harassment, abuse, and murder of women and girls have galvanized the movement. These have included the 2012 Delhi gang rape, 2012 Jimmy Savile allegations, the Bill Cosby allegations, 2014 Isla Vista killings, 2016 trial of Jian Ghomeshi, 2017 Harvey Weinstein allegations and subsequent Weinstein effect, and the 2017 Westminster sexual scandals.\n\nExamples of fourth-wave feminist campaigns include the Everyday Sexism Project, No More Page 3, Stop Bild Sexism, \"Mattress Performance\", \"10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman\", #YesAllWomen, Free the Nipple, One Billion Rising, the 2017 Women's March, the 2018 Women's March, and the #MeToo movement. In December 2017, \"Time\" magazine chose several prominent female activists involved in the #MeToo movement, dubbed \"the silence breakers\", as Person of the Year.\n\nThe term post-feminism is used to describe a range of viewpoints reacting to feminism since the 1980s. While not being \"anti-feminist\", post-feminists believe that women have achieved second wave goals while being critical of third and fourth wave feminist goals. The term was first used to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, but it is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas. Other post-feminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society. Amelia Jones has written that the post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity. Dorothy Chunn notes a \"blaming narrative\" under the post-feminist moniker, where feminists are undermined for continuing to make demands for gender equality in a \"post-feminist\" society, where \"gender equality has (already) been achieved.\" According to Chunn, \"many feminists have voiced disquiet about the ways in which rights and equality discourses are now used against them.\"\n\nFeminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work in a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, economics, women's studies, literary criticism, art history, psychoanalysis and philosophy. Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics, power relations, and sexuality. While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, stereotyping, objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, and patriarchy.\nIn the field of literary criticism, Elaine Showalter describes the development of feminist theory as having three phases. The first she calls \"feminist critique\", in which the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls \"gynocriticism\", in which the \"woman is producer of textual meaning\". The last phase she calls \"gender theory\", in which the \"ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system are explored\".\n\nThis was paralleled in the 1970s by French feminists, who developed the concept of \"écriture féminine\" (which translates as 'female or feminine writing'). Helene Cixous argues that writing and philosophy are \"\" and along with other French feminists such as Luce Irigaray emphasize \"writing from the body\" as a subversive exercise. The work of Julia Kristeva, a feminist psychoanalyst and philosopher, and Bracha Ettinger, artist and psychoanalyst, has influenced feminist theory in general and feminist literary criticism in particular. However, as the scholar Elizabeth Wright points out, \"none of these French feminists align themselves with the feminist movement as it appeared in the Anglophone world\". More recent feminist theory, such as that of Lisa Lucile Owens, has concentrated on characterizing feminism as a universal emancipatory movement.\n\nMany overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years.\n\nSome branches of feminism closely track the political leanings of the larger society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment. Liberal feminism seeks individualistic equality of men and women through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the neoliberal shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality. Due to this she argues that Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.\n\nRadical feminism considers the male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary. Conservative feminism is conservative relative to the society in which it resides. Libertarian feminism conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference. Separatist feminism does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian feminism is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist. Ecofeminists see men's control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the natural environment; ecofeminism has been criticized for focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.\n\nRosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham say that materialist forms of feminism grew out of Western Marxist thought and have inspired a number of different (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women. Marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies. Socialist feminism distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression. Anarcha-feminists believe that class struggle and anarchy against the state require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.\n\nSara Ahmed argues that Black and Postcolonial feminisms pose a challenge \"to some of the organizing premises of Western feminist thought.\" During much of its history, feminist movements and theoretical developments were led predominantly by middle-class white women from Western Europe and North America. However women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms. This trend accelerated in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the United States and the collapse of European colonialism in Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Since that time, women in developing nations and former colonies and who are of colour or various ethnicities or living in poverty have proposed additional feminisms. Womanism emerged after early feminist movements were largely white and middle-class. Postcolonial feminists argue that colonial oppression and Western feminism marginalized postcolonial women but did not turn them passive or voiceless. Third-world feminism and Indigenous feminism are closely related to postcolonial feminism. These ideas also correspond with ideas in African feminism, motherism, Stiwanism, negofeminism, femalism, transnational feminism, and Africana womanism.\n\nIn the late twentieth century various feminists began to argue that gender roles are socially constructed, and that it is impossible to generalize women's experiences across cultures and histories. Post-structural feminism draws on the philosophies of post-structuralism and deconstruction in order to argue that the concept of gender is created socially and culturally through discourse. Postmodern feminists also emphasize the social construction of gender and the discursive nature of reality; however, as Pamela Abbott et al. note, a postmodern approach to feminism highlights \"the existence of multiple truths (rather than simply men and women's standpoints)\".\n\nFeminist views on transgender people differ. Some feminists do not view trans women as women, believing that they have male privilege due to their sex assignment at birth. Additionally, some feminists reject \"transgenderism\" due to views that all behavioral differences between genders are a result of socialization. In contrast, transfeminists believe that the liberation of trans women is a necessary part of feminist goals. Third-wave feminists are overall more supportive of trans rights. A key concept in transfeminism is of transmisogyny, which is the irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against transgender women or feminine gender non conformers.\n\nRiot grrrls took an anti-corporate stance of self-sufficiency and self-reliance. Riot grrrl's emphasis on universal female identity and separatism often appears more closely allied with second-wave feminism than with the third wave. The movement encouraged and made \"adolescent girls' standpoints central\", allowing them to express themselves fully. Lipstick feminism is a cultural feminist movement that attempts to respond to the backlash of second-wave radical feminism of the 1960s and 1970s by reclaiming symbols of \"feminine\" identity such as make-up, suggestive clothing and having a sexual allure as valid and empowering personal choices.\n\nAccording to 2015 poll, 18 percent of Americans consider themselves feminists, while 85 percent reported they believe in \"equality for women\". Despite the popular belief in equal rights, 52 percent did not identify as feminist, 26 percent were unsure, and four percent provided no response.\n\nAccording to 2014 Ipsos poll covering 15 developed countries, 53 percent of respondents identified as feminists, and 87% agreed that \"women should be treated equally to men in all areas based on their competency, not their gender\". However, only 55% of women agreed that they have \"full equality with men and the freedom to reach their full dreams and aspirations\".\n\nAmong women, some of the strongest support for feminism was found in Sweden, where one in three (36%) agreed very much that they defined themselves as feminists. They were followed by women in Italy (31%) and Argentina (29%). Those in the middle of the ranking were from Great Britain (22%), Spain (22%), United States (20%), Australia (18%), Belgium (18%), France (18%), Canada (17%), Poland (17%), and Hungary (15%). Women least likely to agree very much were from Japan (8%), Germany (7%) and South Korea (7%).\n\nOne quarter of men in Italy (25%) and Argentina (25%), and two in ten of those in Poland (21%) and France (19%), defined themselves as feminists. They were followed by those from Sweden (17%), Spain (16%), the United States (16%), Canada (15%), Great Britain (14%), Hungary (12%), Belgium (11%) and Australia (10%). Men least likely to identify this way were from South Korea (7%), Germany (3%) and Japan (3%).\n\nWomen were more likely to self-identify as being feminists than men in every country in the study except for Poland, where 21% of men were and only 17% of women were likely to agree very much with the statement, and South Korea, where there was no difference between men and women (7%) on this measure.\n\nFeminist views on sexuality vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken a few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in what came to be known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.\n\nOpinions on the sex industry are diverse. Feminists critical of the sex industry generally see it as the exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of the sex industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality. For the views of feminism on male prostitutes see the article on male prostitution.\n\nFeminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of violence against women, to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression. Similarly, feminists' views on prostitution vary, ranging from critical to supportive.\n\nFor feminists, a woman's right to control her own sexuality is a key issue. Feminists such as Catharine MacKinnon argue that women have very little control over their own bodies, with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies. Feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement, and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances. In many cultures, men do not believe that a woman has the right to reject a man's sexual advances or to make an autonomous decision about participating in sex. Feminists argue that all cultures are, in one way or another, dominated by ideologies that largely deny women the right to decide how to express their sexuality, because men under patriarchy feel entitled to define sex on their own terms. This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In many parts of the world, especially in conservative and religious cultures, marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour. In more liberal cultures, this entitlement takes the form of a general sexualization of the whole culture. This is played out in the sexual objectification of women, with pornography and other forms of sexual entertainment creating the fantasy that all women exist solely for men's sexual pleasure, and that women are readily available and desiring to engage in sex at any time, with any man, on a man's terms.\n\nSandra Harding says that the \"moral and political insights of the women's movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender, sex and relations within and between the social and natural worlds.\" Some feminists, such as Ruth Hubbard and Evelyn Fox Keller, criticize traditional scientific discourse as being historically biased towards a male perspective. A part of the feminist research agenda is the examination of the ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions. Physicist Lisa Randall, appointed to a task force at Harvard by then-president Lawrence Summers after his controversial discussion of why women may be underrepresented in science and engineering, said, \"I just want to see a whole bunch more women enter the field so these issues don't have to come up anymore.\"\n\nLynn Hankinson Nelson notes that feminist empiricists find fundamental differences between the experiences of men and women. Thus, they seek to obtain knowledge through the examination of the experiences of women, and to \"uncover the consequences of omitting, misdescribing, or devaluing them\" to account for a range of human experience. Another part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions. Furthermore, despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature, structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals, especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality.\n\nOne criticism of feminist epistemology is that it allows social and political values to influence its findings. Susan Haack also points out that feminist epistemology reinforces traditional stereotypes about women's thinking (as intuitive and emotional, etc.); Meera Nanda further cautions that this may in fact trap women within \"traditional gender roles and help justify patriarchy\".\n\nModern feminism challenges the essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, \"Myths of Gender\", explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In \"Delusions of Gender,\" Cordelia Fine disputes scientific evidence that suggests that there is an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.\n\nFeminism in psychology emerged as a critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates in psychology, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.\n\nGender-based inquiries into and conceptualization of architecture have also come about, leading to feminism in modern architecture. Piyush Mathur coined the term \"archigenderic\". Claiming that \"architectural planning has an inextricable link with the defining and regulation of gender roles, responsibilities, rights, and limitations\", Mathur came up with that term \"to explore ... the meaning of 'architecture' in terms of gender\" and \"to explore the meaning of 'gender' in terms of architecture\".\n\nFeminist activists have established a range of feminist businesses, including women's bookstores, feminist credit unions, feminist presses, feminist mail-order catalogs, and feminist restaurants. These businesses flourished as part of the second and third-waves of feminism in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\n\nCorresponding with general developments within feminism, and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement began in the 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s. Jeremy Strick, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, described the feminist art movement as \"the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period\", and Peggy Phelan says that it \"brought about the most far-reaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing over the past four decades\". Feminist artist Judy Chicago, who created \"The Dinner Party\", a set of vulva-themed ceramic plates in the 1970s, said in 2009 to \"ARTnews\", \"There is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male Eurocentric narrative. We are trying to change the future: to get girls and boys to realize that women's art is not an exception—it's a normal part of art history.\" A feminist approach to the visual arts has most recently developed through Cyberfeminism and the posthuman turn, giving voice to the ways \"contemporary female artists are dealing with gender, social media and the notion of embodiment\".\n\nThe feminist movement produced feminist fiction, feminist non-fiction, and feminist poetry, which created new interest in women's writing. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's historical and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest. There has also been a close link between feminist literature and activism, with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era.\n\nMuch of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. In Western feminist literary scholarship, Studies like Dale Spender's \"Mothers of the Novel\" (1986) and Jane Spencer's \"The Rise of the Woman Novelist\" (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing.\n\nCommensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. Virago Press began to publish its large list of 19th and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels written by women. More recently, Broadview Press continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the University of Kentucky has a series of republications of early women's novels.\n\nParticular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts. \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" (1792) by Mary Wollstonecraft, is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. \"A Room of One's Own\" (1929) by Virginia Woolf, is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.\n\nThe widespread interest in women's writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the literary canon. Interest in post-colonial literatures, gay and lesbian literature, writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered \"literature\", and genres hitherto not regarded as \"literary\", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest. Most genres and subgenres have undergone a similar analysis, so literary studies has entered new territories such as the \"female gothic\" or women's science fiction.\n\nAccording to Elyce Rae Helford, \"Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice.\" Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender. Notable texts of this kind are Ursula K. Le Guin's \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" (1969), Joanna Russ' \"The Female Man\" (1970), Octavia Butler's \"Kindred\" (1979) and Margaret Atwood's \"Handmaid's Tale\" (1985).\n\nFeminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about women's lived experiences. For example, Maya Angelou's \"I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings\" was extremely influential, as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the United States.\n\nIn addition, many feminist movements have embraced poetry as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.\n\nWomen's music (or womyn's music or wimmin's music) is the music by women, for women, and about women. The genre emerged as a musical expression of the second-wave feminist movement as well as the labour, civil rights, and peace movements. The movement was started by lesbians such as Cris Williamson, Meg Christian, and Margie Adam, African-American women activists such as Bernice Johnson Reagon and her group Sweet Honey in the Rock, and peace activist Holly Near. Women's music also refers to the wider industry of women's music that goes beyond the performing artists to include studio musicians, producers, sound engineers, technicians, cover artists, distributors, promoters, and festival organizers who are also women.\nRiot grrrl is an underground feminist hardcore punk movement described in the cultural movements section of this article.\n\nFeminism became a principal concern of musicologists in the 1980s as part of the New Musicology. Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of canon, genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked. Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like Susan McClary, Marcia Citron and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and education of women; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.\n\nWhile the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the leader of an orchestra. In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.\n\nFeminist cinema, advocating or illustrating feminist perspectives, arose largely with the development of feminist film theory in the late '60s and early '70s. Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women. Differences were particularly marked between feminists on either side of the Atlantic. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, \"Women and Film\". Trailblazers from this period included Claire Johnston and Laura Mulvey, who also organized the Women's Event at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include Teresa de Lauretis, Anneke Smelik and Kaja Silverman. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution.\n\nIt has been argued that there are two distinct approaches to independent, theoretically inspired feminist filmmaking. 'Deconstruction' concerns itself with analysing and breaking down codes of mainstream cinema, aiming to create a different relationship between the spectator and dominant cinema. The second approach, a feminist counterculture, embodies feminine writing to investigate a specifically feminine cinematic language. Some recent criticism of \"feminist film\" approaches has centred around a Swedish rating system called the Bechdel test.\n\nDuring the 1930s–1950s heyday of the big Hollywood studios, the status of women in the industry was abysmal. Since then female directors such as Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion have made art movies, and directors like Kathryn Bigelow and Patty Jenkins have had mainstream success. This progress stagnated in the 90s, and men outnumber women five to one in behind the camera roles.\n\nFeminism had complex interactions with the major political movements of the twentieth century.\n\nSince the late nineteenth century some feminists have allied with socialism, whereas others have criticized socialist ideology for being insufficiently concerned about women's rights. August Bebel, an early activist of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD), published his work \"Die Frau und der Sozialismus\", juxtaposing the struggle for equal rights between sexes with social equality in general. In 1907 there was an International Conference of Socialist Women in Stuttgart where suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle. Clara Zetkin of the SPD called for women's suffrage to build a \"socialist order, the only one that allows for a radical solution to the women's question\".\n\nIn Britain, the women's movement was allied with the Labour party. In the U.S., Betty Friedan emerged from a radical background to take leadership. Radical Women is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U.S. and is still active. During the Spanish Civil War, Dolores Ibárruri (\"La Pasionaria\") led the Communist Party of Spain. Although she supported equal rights for women, she opposed women fighting on the front and clashed with the anarcha-feminist Mujeres Libres.\n\nFeminists in Ireland in the early 20th century included the revolutionary Irish Republican, suffragette and socialist Constance Markievicz who in 1918 was the first woman elected to the British House of Commons. However, in line with Sinn Féin abstentionist policy, she would not take her seat in the House of Commons. She was re-elected to the Second Dáil in the elections of 1921. She was also a commander of the Irish Citizens Army which was led by the socialist & self-described feminist, Irish leader James Connolly during the 1916 Easter Rising.\n\nFascism has been prescribed dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in the Fascist manifesto in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary groups such as the \"fasci femminilli\" and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from dictator Benito Mussolini's more conservative coalition partners.\n\nCyprian Blamires states that although feminists were among those who opposed the rise of Adolf Hitler, feminism has a complicated relationship with the Nazi movement as well. While Nazis glorified traditional notions of patriarchal society and its role for women, they claimed to recognize women's equality in employment. However, Hitler and Mussolini declared themselves as opposed to feminism, and after the rise of Nazism in Germany in 1933, there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the pre-war period and to some extent during the 1920s. Georges Duby et al. note that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility, with women maintaining a largely subordinate position. Blamires also notes that Neofascism has since the 1960s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept \"their traditional roles\".\n\nThe civil rights movement has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights and the rights of non-white people. Despite the connections between the women's and civil rights movements, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues. Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, classism, and sexism, and new feminisms, such as black feminism and Chicana feminism.\n\nNeoliberalism has been criticized by feminist theory for having a negative effect on the female workforce population across the globe, especially in the global south. Masculinist assumptions and objectives continue to dominate economic and geopolitical thinking. Women's experiences in non-industrialized countries reveal often deleterious effects of modernization policies and undercut orthodox claims that development benefits everyone.\n\nProponents of neoliberalism have theorized that by increasing women's participation in the workforce, there will be heightened economic progress, but feminist critics have noted that this participation alone does not further equality in gender relations. Neoliberalism has failed to address significant problems such as the devaluation of feminized labour, the structural privileging of men and masculinity, and the politicization of women's subordination in the family and the workplace. The \"feminization of employment\" refers to a conceptual characterization of deteriorated and devalorized labour conditions that are less desirable, meaningful, safe and secure. Employers in the global south have perceptions about feminine labour and seek workers who are perceived to be undemanding, docile and willing to accept low wages. Social constructs about feminized labour have played a big part in this, for instance, employers often perpetuate ideas about women as 'secondary income earners to justify their lower rates of pay and not deserving of training or promotion.\n\nThe feminist movement has effected change in Western society, including women's suffrage; greater access to education; more nearly equitable pay with men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); and the right to own property.\n\nFrom the 1960s on, the campaign for women's rights was met with mixed results in the U.S. and the U.K. Other countries of the EEC agreed to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the European Community.\n\nSome feminist campaigning also helped reform attitudes to child sexual abuse. The view that young girls cause men to have sexual intercourse with them was replaced by that of men's responsibility for their own conduct, the men being adults.\n\nIn the U.S., the National Organization for Women (NOW) began in 1966 to seek women's equality, including through the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which did not pass, although some states enacted their own. Reproductive rights in the U.S. centred on the court decision in \"Roe\" v. \"Wade\" enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable birth control, allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under Margaret Sanger and elsewhere under Marie Stopes. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through birth control, which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.\n\nThe division of labour within households was affected by the increased entry of women into workplaces in the 20th century. Sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild found that, in two-career couples, men and women, on average, spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework, although Cathy Young responded by arguing that women may prevent equal participation by men in housework and parenting. Judith K. Brown writes, \"Women are most likely to make a substantial contribution when subsistence activities have the following characteristics: the participant is not obliged to be far from home; the tasks are relatively monotonous and do not require rapt concentration; and the work is not dangerous, can be performed in spite of interruptions, and is easily resumed once interrupted.\"\n\nIn international law, the \"Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women\" (CEDAW) is an international convention adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and described as an international bill of rights for women. It came into force in those nations ratifying it.\n\nFeminist jurisprudence is a branch of jurisprudence that examines the relationship between women and law. It addresses questions about the history of legal and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their legal rights.\n\nFeminist jurisprudence signifies a reaction to the philosophical approach of modern legal scholars, who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.\n\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that the use of gender-specific language often implies male superiority or reflects an unequal state of society. According to \"The Handbook of English Linguistics\", generic masculine pronouns and gender-specific job titles are instances \"where English linguistic convention has historically treated men as prototypical of the human species.\"\n\nMerriam-Webster chose \"feminism\" as its 2017 Word of the Year, noting that \"Word of the Year is a quantitative measure of interest in a particular word.\"\n\nFeminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.\n\nChristian feminism is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity in light of the equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.\n\nIslamic feminists advocate women's rights, gender equality, and social justice grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, \"hadith\" (sayings of Muhammad), and \"sharia\" (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.\n\nBuddhist feminism is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Buddhism. It is an aspect of feminist theology which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective. The Buddhist feminist Rita Gross describes Buddhist feminism as \"the radical practice of the co-humanity of women and men.\"\n\nJewish feminism is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. The main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or \"minyan\", the exemption from positive time-bound \"mitzvot\", and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce. Many Jewish women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history.\n\nDianic Wicca is a feminist-centred thealogy.\n\nSecular or atheist feminists have engaged in feminist criticism of religion, arguing that many religions have oppressive rules towards women and misogynistic themes and elements in religious texts.\n\nPatriarchy is a social system in which society is organized around male authority figures. In this system fathers have authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege, and is dependent on female subordination. Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women. Carole Pateman argues that the patriarchal distinction \"between masculinity and femininity is the political difference between freedom and subjection.\" In feminist theory the concept of patriarchy often includes all the social mechanisms that reproduce and exert male dominance over women. Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations. Some radical feminists have proposed that because patriarchy is too deeply rooted in society, separatism is the only viable solution. Other feminists have criticized these views as being anti-men.\n\nFeminist theory has explored the social construction of masculinity and its implications for the goal of gender equality. The social construct of masculinity is seen by feminism as problematic because it associates males with aggression and competition, and reinforces patriarchal and unequal gender relations. Patriarchal cultures are criticized for \"limiting forms of masculinity\" available to men and thus narrowing their life choices. Some feminists are engaged with men's issues activism, such as bringing attention to male rape and spousal battery and addressing negative social expectations for men.\n\nMale participation in feminism is generally encouraged by feminists and is seen as an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that men and women should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism. It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's agency.\n\nDifferent groups of people have responded to feminism, and both men and women have been among its supporters and critics. Among American university students, for both men and women, support for feminist ideas is more common than self-identification as a feminist. The US media tends to portray feminism negatively and feminists \"are less often associated with day-to-day work/leisure activities of regular women.\" However, as recent research has demonstrated, as people are exposed to self-identified feminists and to discussions relating to various forms of feminism, their own self-identification with feminism increases.\n\nPro-feminism is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.\n\nAnti-feminism is opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on opposition to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.\n\nSome people have opposed feminism on the grounds that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs. These anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained. Other anti-feminists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.\n\nWriters such as Camille Paglia, Christina Hoff Sommers, Jean Bethke Elshtain, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, Lisa Lucile Owens and Daphne Patai oppose some forms of feminism, though they identify as feminists. They argue, for example, that feminism often promotes misandry and the elevation of women's interests above men's, and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women. Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge argue that the term \"anti-feminist\" is used to silence academic debate about feminism. Lisa Lucile Owens argues that certain rights extended exclusively to women are patriarchal because they relieve women from exercising a crucial aspect of their moral agency.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14423810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14423810", "title": "Fula alphabets", "text": "Fula alphabets\n\nThe Fula language (, \"Pulaar\", or \"Pular\") is written primarily in the Latin script, but in some areas is still written in an older Arabic script called the Ajami script or with its own script called Adlam.\n\nThe Latin script was introduced to Fula-speaking regions of West and Central Africa by Europeans during, and in some cases immediately before, invasion. Various people — missionaries, colonial administrators, and scholarly researchers — devised various ways of writing . One issue similar to other efforts by Europeans to use their alphabet and home orthographic conventions was how to write African languages with unfamiliar sounds. In the case of Fula, these included how to represent sounds such as the implosive b and d, the ejective y, the velar n (the latter being present in European languages, but never in initial position), prenasalised consonants, and long vowels, all of which are can change meaning.\n\nMajor influences on the current forms used for writing Fula were decisions made by colonial administrators in Northern Nigeria and the Africa Alphabet. Post independence African governments decided to retain the Latin alphabet as the basis for transcribing their languages. Various writers in Fula, such as Amadou Hampate Ba and Alfa Ibrahim Sow, wrote and published in this script.\n\nMajor UNESCO-sponsored conferences on harmonising Latin-based African language orthographies in Bamako in 1966 and Niamey in 1978 confirmed standards for writing Fula. Nevertheless, orthographies for the language and its variants are determined at the country level. So while Fula writing uses basically the same character sets and rules across the region, there are some minor variations.\n\nSome general rules:\n\n\nPrior to adoption of this system in 1989, the Guinean languages alphabet was used. This was based on the simple Latin alphabet with digraphs for the sounds particular to Pular, and is still used by some Pular speakers (in part because it can be typed using commercial keyboards). The character equivalents include: bh = ɓ ; dh = ɗ ; q = ɠ ; ny = ɲ (the French digraph gn is also used); nh = ŋ ; yh = ƴ. The old system also included: ty = c ; dy = j.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Arabic script was introduced into the West African Sahel with Islam several centuries before European colonization. As was the case with other languages such as Hausa, Muslim Fulas who went through Koranic education adapted the script to writing their language. This practice, while never formally standardized, followed some patterns of customary use in various regions. These usages differ on some details, mainly on how to represent certain consonants and vowels not present in the Arabic language.\n\nDuring the late 1980s an alphabetic script was devised by the teenaged brothers Ibrahima Barry and Abdoulaye Barry, in order to represent the Fulani language. After several years of development it started to be widely adopted among Fulani communities, and is currently taught in Guinea, Nigeria, Liberia and other nearby countries. The name \"adlam\" is an acronym derived from the first four letters of the alphabet (A, D, L, M), standing for \"Alkule Dandayɗe Leñol Mulugol\" (\"the alphabet that protects the peoples from vanishing\").\nThere are Android apps to send SMS in adlam and to learn the alphabet. On computers running Microsoft Windows, the adlam script is natively supported as part of the upcoming feature update of Windows 10 version 1903 (codenamed 19H1) build 18252.\n\nThe extended Latin characters used in the Latin transcription of Fula were incorporated since an early version of the Unicode Standard. At least some of the extended Arabic characters used in Ajami are also in the Unicode standard.\n\nThe Adlam alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2016 with the release of version 9.0; the proposal was authored by Michael Everson. In October 2017, Google released a Noto font that supports the block, Noto Sans Adlam. On October 3, 2018, Microsoft released an updated Ebrima font to support Adlam alphabet to Windows Insiders as part of the upcoming Windows 10 version 1903 feature update, starting from build 18252.\n\nThe Unicode block for Adlam is U+1E900–U+1E95F:\n\nThere has been at least one effort to adapt the N'Ko alphabet to the Pular language of Guinea.\n\n"}
{"id": "172940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172940", "title": "Germanic weak verb", "text": "Germanic weak verb\n\nIn Germanic languages, weak verbs are by far the largest group of verbs, which are therefore often regarded as the norm (the regular verbs), but they are not historically the oldest or most original group.\n\nIn Germanic languages, weak verbs are those verbs that form their preterites and past participles by means of a dental suffix, an inflection that contains a or sound or similar. (For comparative purposes, they will be referred to as a dental, but in some of the languages, including most varieties of English, and are alveolar instead.) In all Germanic languages, the preterite and past participle forms of weak verbs are formed from the same stem.:\n\nHistorically, the pronunciation of the suffix in the vast majority of weak verbs (all four classes) was , but in most sources discussing Proto-Germanic, it is spelled by convention. In the West Germanic languages, the suffix hardened to , but it remained a fricative in the other early Germanic languages (Gothic and often in Old Norse).\n\nIn English, the dental is a after a voiced consonant (\"loved\") or vowel (\"laid\"), and a after a voiceless consonant (\"laughed\"), but English uses the spelling in regardless of pronunciation, with the exception of a few verbs with irregular spellings.\n\nIn Dutch, and are distributed as in English provided there is a following vowel, but when there is no following vowel, terminal devoicing causes the pronunciation /t/ in all cases. Nevertheless, Dutch still distinguishes the spellings in and even in final position: see the 't kofschip rule.\n\nIn Afrikaans, which descends from Dutch, the past tense has fallen out of use altogether, and the past participle is marked only with the prefix \"ge-\". Therefore, the suffix has disappeared along with the forms that originally contained it.\n\nIn German the dental is always and always spelled because of the third phase of the High German consonant shift (d→t).\n\nIn Low German, the dental ending of the preterite tense was originally in or , according to the stem of the verb. However the ending has fallen out in pronunciation, starting in the 17th century when the preterite was written with an ending \"-er\" representing the sound which was already the last remain of the former \"-de\" and \"-te\" endings of Middle Low German. Now, the only Low German verb that still shows a remnant of dental ending is \"leggen\", which has the preterite \"leed\", and the verb \"hebben\", which has \"harr\" with old \"r\"-ending from the Middle Low German dental.\n\nIn Icelandic, the dental was originally a voiced dental fricative . It is preserved as such after vowels, voiced fricatives and but has been hardened to a stop after nasals and , and has been devoiced to after voiceless consonants and in some other cases (in most Old Norse texts, the alternation is already found in heavy roots, but the light ones preserve ). Furthermore, the voicing contrast between and has been replaced in Modern Icelandic by an aspiration contrast, which may not be realized phonetically in all the relevant positions.\n\nThe situation of early Norwegian was similar to Icelandic, but intervocalic eventually disappeared. In the verbs in which it remains, the dental is , , depending on conjugation class and dialect. It is spelled accordingly. In Nynorsk, it can be different in the preterite and the past participle.\n\nSwedish has a similar situation to that of Norwegian, but the dental is retained in the spelling, even between vowels. Some informal spellings indicate a lost dental, such as in \"sa\" (\"said\") from the standard spelling \"sade\".\n\nIn Proto-Germanic, there were seven types of weak verbs, five of which were significant. However, they are normally grouped into four classes, based on the conjugational system of Gothic.\n\nClass I verbs actually consist of three classes in Proto-Germanic:\n\nA small class of verbs had no suffix in the present, and no suffix in the past (other than the -d- or -t- of all weak verbs). This class had only three members:\n\n\nA small class of verbs had the suffix -j- in the present and no suffix in the past. This class had only five members in Proto-Germanic:\n\n\nVerbs of this class were said to undergo rückumlaut (\"reverse umlaut\") in the past, since the umlaut occurring in the present (triggered by the -j-) is undone or \"reversed\" in the past (due to the lack of the umlaut-triggering stem -i- of subclass (iii)), leading to a non-umlauted vowel in the past.\n\nThese verbs also have consonant and vowel alternations between present and past that are due to regular sound changes but result in strikingly different forms in the historical Germanic languages (e.g. think, past tense thought). Specifically:\n\nThe class remained small in Gothic, but expanded significantly in the other languages:\n\n\nIn Late Old English, further verbs in -can were drawn into this class by analogy, but with umlaut maintained, e.g. bepǣcan \"to deceive\", past tense bepǣhte, earlier bepǣcte, or wleccan \"to warm\", past tense wlehte, earlier wlecede. At the same time, verbs in -ccan were modified to follow the same pattern, e.g. new past tense cwehte alongside earlier cweahte.\n\nA large class of verbs had the suffix -j- in the present and -i- in the past: e.g. Gothic satjan \"to set\" (Old English settan), sandjan \"to send\" (Old English sendan). As shown in the Old English cognates:\n\nThis class was split into two subclasses in all the Old Germanic languages, one consisting of short-stem verbs and one of long-stem verbs. The distinction between the two was originally due to Sievers' Law, and was extended due to changes such as West Germanic gemination, which affected short-stem but not long-stem verbs. The West Germanic languages had a third subclass consisting of short-stem verbs ending in -r (e.g. Old English erian \"to plow\", nerian \"to save\", styrian \"to stir\"), due to West Germanic gemination and subsequent loss of -j- not taking place.\n\nThe following is a cross-language paradigm of a short-stem Class I verb *gramjaną \"to anger\" (Gothic gramjan, Old Norse gremja, Old High German gremmen, Old Saxon *gremmian, Old English gremman, Old Frisian *gremma). Note that the Old Saxon and Old Frisian verbs given here are unattested, almost certainly due to the small nature of the respective corpora.\n\nThe following is a cross-language paradigm of a long-stem Class I verb *hauzijaną \"to hear\" (Gothic hausjan, Old Norse heyra, Old High German hōren, Old Saxon hōrian, Old English hīeran, Old Frisian hēra)\n\nClass II verbs were formed with a suffix -ō-. In the northern West Germanic languages, an alternative extended suffix -ōja- sometimes appears in the non-past forms, e.g. the Old English infinitive -ian < *-ōjan.\n\nThe following is a cross-language paradigm of *laþōną \"to invite\" (Gothic laþōn, Old Norse laða, Old High German ladōn, lathōn, Old Saxon lathian (-ōjan), ladian (-ōjan), Old English laþian, Old Frisian lathia).\n\nWhat is known as \"Class III\" was actually two separate classes in Proto-Germanic:\n\nThe histories of this class in the various Germanic languages are quite varied:\n\nAn example is the stative verb reconstructed as Proto-Germanic *habjaną \"to have\", past indicative third-person singular habdē:\n\nOnly four stative verbs survive as Class III verbs in the northern West Germanic languages (i.e. Old English, Old Saxon, Old Frisian and Old Low Franconian):\n\nHowever, there are five more verbs that appear as Class III verbs in Old High German, Gothic and/or Old Norse that also have remnants of the stative conjugation in one or more northern West Germanic languages:\n\nClass IV verbs were formed with a suffix -nan, e.g. Gothic fullnan \"to become full\". The present tense was conjugated as a strong verb, e.g. Gothic fullna, fullnis, fullniþ, etc. The past tense was conjugated with suffix -nō-, e.g. Gothic fullnōda, fullnōdēs, etc. This class vanished in other Germanic languages; however, a significant number of cognate verbs appear as Class II verbs in Old Norse and as Class III verbs in Old High German. This class has fientive semantics, i.e. \"become X\" where X is an adjective or a past participle of a verb. Examples of deadjectival Class IV verbs in Gothic are ga-blindnan \"to become blind\" (blinds \"blind\"), ga-háilnan \"to become whole\" (háils \"whole\"). Examples of deverbal Class IV verbs in Gothic are fra-lusnan \"to perish\" (fra-liusan \"to destroy\"), ga-þaúrsnan \"to dry up, wither away\" (ga-þaírsan \"to wither\"), mikilnan \"to be magnified\" (mikiljan \"to magnify\"), us-háuhnan \"to be exalted\" (us-háuhjan \"to exalt\"). Note that the last two are deverbal even though the underlying root is adjectival, since they are formed to other verbs (which are in turn formed off of adjectives). The vast majority of Class IV verbs appear to be deverbal. Class IV verbs derived from weak verbs keep the same stem form as the underlying weak verb. However, class IV verbs derived from strong verbs adopt the ablaut of the past participle, e.g. dis-skritnan \"to be torn to pieces\" (Class I dis-skreitan \"to tear to pieces\"), us-gutnan \"to be poured out\" (Class II giutan \"to pour\"), and-bundnan \"to become unbound\" (Class III and-bindan \"to unbind\"), dis-taúrnan \"to be torn asunder, burst asunder\" (Class IV dis-taíran \"to tear asunder, burst\"), ufar-hafnan \"to be exalted\" (Class VI ufar-hafjan \"to exalt\"), bi-auknan \"to abound, become larger\" (Class VII bi-aukan \"to increase, add to\").\n\nIn the modern languages, the various classes have mostly been leveled into a single productive class. Icelandic, Norwegian and Frisian have retained two productive classes of weak verbs. (In Frisian, in addition to the class with -de, there is a class of je-verbs, where the dental suffix has dropped, i.e. -je < -iad.) Swiss German also has two types of weak verbs, descended from Class I and Classes II and III respectively of Old High German weak verbs and marked with -t and -et, respectively, in the past participle.\n\nIn the history of English, the following changes happened:\n\n\nIn Modern English, only one productive weak paradigm remains, derived from Class II. A number of Class I verbs still persist, e.g.:\n\n\nAs the previous list shows, although there is only one productive class of weak verbs, there are plenty of \"irregular\" weak verbs that don't follow the paradigm of this class. Furthermore, the regular paradigm in English is not unitary, but in fact is divided into subclasses in both the written and spoken language, although in different ways:\n\nBoth of these characteristics occur in a similar fashion in most or all the modern Germanic languages. In modern German, for example, descendants of the original subclass (ii) of Class I are still irregular (e.g. denken (dachte) \"to think\", brennen (brannte) \"to burn\"), and subclasses of the productive verb paradigm are formed by verbs ending in -eln or -ern and in -ten or -den, among others.\n\nOne of the regular weak verb conjugations is as follows.\n\nWeak verbs should be contrasted with strong verbs, which form their past tenses by means of \"ablaut\" (vowel gradation: \"sing - sang - sung\"). Most verbs in the early stages of the Germanic languages were strong. However, as the ablaut system is no longer productive except in rare cases of analogy, almost all new verbs in Germanic languages are weak, and the majority of the original strong verbs have become weak by analogy.\n\nAs an example of the rather common process of originally strong verbs becoming weak, we may consider the development from the Old English strong verb \"scūfan\" to modern English \"shove\":\nMany hundreds of weak verbs in contemporary English go back to Old English strong verbs.\n\nIn some cases, a verb has become weak in the preterite but not in the participle and may be thought of as \"semi-strong\" (not a technical term). Dutch has a number of examples:\n\nAn example in English is:\n\nOften, the old strong participle may survive as an adjective long after it has been replaced with a weak form in verbal constructions. The English adjective \"molten\" is an old strong participle of \"melt\", which is now a purely weak verb with the participle \"melted\". The participle \"gebacken\" of the German verb \"backen\" (to bake), is gradually being replaced by \"gebackt\", but the adjective is always \"gebacken\" (baked).\n\nThe reverse process is very rare and can also be partial, producing \"semi-strong\" verbs:\n\nWeak verbs which develop strong forms are often unstable. A typical example is German \"fragen\" (to ask), which is historically weak and still weak in Standard German, but for a time in the 18th century, the forms \"fragen frug gefragen\" by analogy with for example \"tragen\" (to carry) were also considered acceptable in the standard. They survive today (along with a present tense \"frägt\") in the Rhinelandic regiolect and underlying dialects. In Dutch, the new strong past \"vroeg\" of the cognate \"vragen\" is standard today, but its past participle is weak \"gevraagd\" (though some dialects do have \"gevrogen\").\n\nThe weak conjugation of verbs is an innovation of Proto-Germanic (unlike the older strong verbs, the basis of which goes back to Proto-Indo-European). While primary verbs (those inherited from PIE) already had an ablaut-based perfect form that was the basis of the Germanic strong preterite, secondary verbs (those derived from other forms after the break-up of PIE) had to form a preterite otherwise, which necessitated the creation of the weak conjugation.\n\nThe vast majority of weak verbs are secondary, or derived. The two main types of derived verbs were denominative and deverbative. A denominative verb is one which has been created out of a noun. The denominative in Indo-European and early Germanic was formed by adding an ablauting thematic *-y- suffix to a noun or adjective. This created verbs such as Gothic \"namnjan\" 'to name'.\n\nA significant subclass of Class I weak verbs are (deverbal) causative verbs. They are formed in a way that reflects a direct inheritance from the PIE causative class of verbs. PIE causatives were formed by adding an accented affix \"-éy-\" to the \"o\"-grade of a non-derived verb. In Proto-Germanic, causatives are formed by adding a suffix \"-j/ij-\" (the reflex of PIE \"-éy-\") to the past-tense ablaut (mostly with the reflex of PIE \"o\"-grade) of a strong verb (the reflex of PIE non-derived verbs), with Verner's Law voicing applied (the reflex of the PIE accent on the \"-éy-\" suffix):\n\n\nEssentially, all verbs formed this way were conjugated as Class I weak verbs.\n\nThat method of forming causative verbs is no longer productive in the modern Germanic languages, but many relics remain. For example, the original strong verb \"fall fell fallen\" has a related weak verb \"fell felled felled\", which means \"to cause (a tree) to fall\"; strong \"sit sat sat\" and \"lie lay lain\" are matched with weak \"set set set\" and \"lay laid laid\", meaning \"to cause something to sit\" or \"lie\" respectively. In some cases, phonological or semantic developments make the pairs difficult to recognise. For example, \"rear\" is the regular phonological development of Proto-Gemanic \"*raizijaną\" given in the above list, but the connection between \"rise\" and \"rear\" is no longer obvious. (One might guess that the counterpart of \"rise\" would be \"raise\", but \"raise\" is a borrowing from Old Norse, \"*raizijaną\" continues regularly.) As another example, \"drench\" was originally the causative of \"drink\", but the modern meaning of \"drench\" (\"to cause to get wet\") is no longer similar to \"cause to drink\". Similarly, German strong \"leiden litt gelitten\" (\"to suffer\") has the derived weak verb \"leiten\" (\"to lead\"), which makes sense when one realises that \"leiden\" originally meant \"walk, go\" and came to its present meaning through the idea of \"undergoing\" suffering.\n\nThere are primary verbs that date to Indo-European that took a weak conjugation because they were unable to take a perfect, including verbs that had zero grade of the root in the present and so were unable to show the ablaut distinction necessary for a strong preterite. That was the case with the verbs \"waurkjan\" 'to work, create', \"bugjan\" 'to buy', and \"sokjan\" 'to seek' (Gothic forms).\n\nPreterite-present verbs are primary verbs in which the PIE present was lost, and the perfect was given a present meaning. They needed a new past tense, which followed the weak pattern.\n\nAll borrowings from other languages into Germanic were weak.\n\nThe origin of the dental suffix is uncertain. Perhaps the most commonly held theory is that it evolved out of a periphrastic construction with the verb \"to do\": Germanic *\"lubō-dēdē\" (\"love-did\") > *\"lubōdē\" > Old English \"lufode\" > \"loved\" or *\"salbō-dē-\" (\"salve-did\", i.e., \"put salve\") > *\"salbōdē-\" > Old English \"sealfode\" > \"salved\". That would be analogous to the way that in Modern English one can form an emphatic past tense with \"did\": \"I did love\", \"I did salve\".\n\nThe common PIE root *\"dʰeh₁-\" meaning 'do' was a root aorist and so did not take a perfect. However, it took a reduplicating present. The imperfect of the root is probably the origin of the dental suffix.\n\nThat view is not without objections:\n\nThe objections are sometimes answered as follows:\n\nAnother theory is that it came from a past participle ending, a final *\"-daz\" from PIE *\"-tos\" (cf Latin \"amatus\"), with personal endings added to it at a later stage. That theory, however, is also disputed because of its inability to explain all the facts.\n\nAccording to Hill (2010), the endings, which in the singular do not show reduplication in any Germanic language, continue the PIE subjunctive of the root aorist.\n\nThe term \"weak verb\" was originally coined by Jacob Grimm, who only applied it to Germanic philology. However, the term is sometimes applied to other language groups to designate phenomena that are not really analogous. For example, Hebrew \"irregular\" verbs are sometimes called weak verbs because one of their radicals is weak. See weak inflection.\n\n"}

{"id": "303023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303023", "title": "John Mandeville", "text": "John Mandeville\n\nSir John Mandeville is the supposed author of \"The Travels of Sir John Mandeville\", a travel memoir which first circulated between 1357 and 1371. The earliest surviving text is in French.\n\nBy aid of translations into many other languages, the work acquired extraordinary popularity. Despite the extremely unreliable and often fantastical nature of the travels it describes, it was used as a work of reference—Christopher Columbus, for example, was heavily influenced by both this work and Marco Polo's earlier \"Travels\".\n\nIn his preface, the compiler calls himself a knight, and states that he was born and bred in England, in the town of St Albans. Although the book is real, it is widely believed that \"Sir John Mandeville\" himself was not. Common theories point to a Frenchman by the name of Jehan a la Barbe (or other possibilities discussed below).\n\nSome recent scholars have suggested that \"The Travels of Sir John Mandeville\" was most likely written by \"Jan de Langhe, a Fleming who wrote in Latin under the name Johannes Longus and in French as \". Jan de Langhe was born in Ypres early in the 1300s and by 1334 had become a Benedictine monk at the abbey of Saint-Bertin in Saint-Omer which was about 20 miles from Calais. After studying law at the University of Paris, Langhe returned to the abbey and was elected abbot in 1365. He was a prolific writer and avid collector of travelogues, right up to his death in 1383.\n\nJohn de Mandeville crossed the sea in 1322; had traversed by way of Turkey (Asia Minor and Cilicia), Tartary, Persia, Syria, Arabia, Egypt upper and lower, Libya, the great part of Ethiopia, Chaldea, Amazonia, India the Less, the Greater and the Middle, and many countries about India; had often been to Jerusalem, and had written in Romance languages as more generally understood than Latin.\n\nAt least part of the personal history of Mandeville is mere invention. No contemporary corroboration of the existence of such a Jehan de Mandeville is known. Some French manuscripts, not contemporary, give a Latin letter of presentation from him to Edward III, but so vague that it might have been penned by any writer on any subject. It is in fact beyond reasonable doubt that the travels were in large part compiled by a Liége physician, known as Johains à le Barbe or Jehan à la Barbe, otherwise Jehan de Bourgogne.\n\nThe evidence of this is in a modernized extract quoted by the Liège herald, Louis Abry (1643–1720), from the lost fourth book of the \"Myreur des Hystors\" of Johans des Preis, styled d'Oultremouse. In this \"Jean de Bourgogne, dit a la Barbe\", is said to have revealed himself on his deathbed to d'Oultremouse, whom he made his executor, and to have described himself in his will as \"messire Jean de Mandeville, chevalier, comte de Montfort en Angleterre et seigneur de l'isle de Campdi et du château Pérouse (Lord Jean de Mandeville, knight, Count de Montfort in England and lord of the Isle of Campdi and the castle Pérouse)\".\n\nIt is added that, having had the misfortune to kill an unnamed count in his own country, he engaged himself to travel through the three parts of the world, arrived at Liège in 1343, was a great naturalist, profound philosopher and astrologer, and had a remarkable knowledge of physics. The identification is confirmed by the fact that in the now destroyed church of the Guillemins was a tombstone of Mandeville, with a Latin inscription stating that he was otherwise named \"ad Barbam\", was a professor of medicine, and died at Liège on November 17, 1372: this inscription is quoted as far back as 1462.\n\nEven before his death, the Liège physician seems to have confessed to a share in the circulation of, and additions to, the work. In the common Latin abridged version of it, at the end of c. vii., the author says that when stopping in the sultan's court at Cairo he met a venerable and expert physician of \"our\" parts, but that they rarely came into conversation because their duties were of a different kind, but that long afterwards at Liège he composed this treatise at the exhortation and with the help (\"Jiortatu et adiutorio\") of the same venerable man, as he will narrate at the end of it.\n\nAnd in the last chapter, he says that in 1355, on returning home, he came to Liège, and being laid up with old age and arthritic gout in the street called Bassesavenyr, i.e. Basse-Sauvenière, consulted the physicians. That one came in who was more venerable than the others by reason of his age and white hairs, was evidently expert in his art, and was commonly called Magister Iohannes ad Barbam. That a chance remark of the latter caused the renewal of their old Cairo acquaintance, and that Ad Barbam, after showing his medical skill on Mandeville, urgently begged him to write his travels; \"and so at length, by his advice and help, \"monitu et adiutorio\", was composed this treatise, of which I had certainly proposed to write nothing until at least I had reached my own parts in England\". He goes on to speak of himself as being now lodged in Liège, \"which is only two days distant from the sea of England\"; and it is stated in the colophon (and in the manuscripts) that the book was first published in French by Mandeville, its author, in 1355, at Liège, and soon after in the same city translated into \"said\" Latin form. Moreover, a manuscript of the French text extant at Liège about 1860 contained a similar statement, and added that the author lodged at a hostel called \"al hoste Henkin Levo\": this manuscript gave the physician's name as \"Johains de Bourgogne dit ale barbe\", which doubtless conveys its local form.\n\nThere is no contemporary English mention of any English knight named Jehan de Mandeville, nor are the arms said to have been on the Liège tomb like any known Mandeville arms. However George F. Warner has suggested that de Bourgogne may be a certain Johan de Bourgoyne, who was pardoned by parliament on 20 August 1321 for having taken part in the attack on the Despensers (Hugh the younger and Hugh the elder), but whose pardon was revoked in May 1322, the year in which \"Mandeville\" professes to have left England. Among the persons similarly pardoned on the recommendation of the same nobleman was a Johan Mangevilayn, whose name appears related to that of \"de Mandeville\", which is a later form of \"de Magneville\".\n\nThe name Mangevilain occurs in Yorkshire as early as the 16th year of the reign of Henry I (England), but is very rare, and (failing evidence of any place named Mangeville) seems to be merely a variant spelling of Magnevillain. The meaning may be simply \"of Magneville\", de Magneville; but the family of a 14th-century bishop of Nevers were called both \"Mandevilain\" and \"de Mandevilain\", where Mandevilain seems a derivative place-name, meaning the Magneville or Mandeville district. The name \"de Mandeville \"might be suggested to de Bourgogne by that of his fellow-culprit Mangevilayn, and it is even possible that the two fled to England together, were in Egypt together, met again at Liège, and shared in the compilation of the \"Travels\".\n\nWhether after the appearance of the \"Travels\" either de Bourgogne or \"Mangevilayn\" visited England is very doubtful. St Albans Abbey had a sapphire ring, and Canterbury a crystal orb, said to have been given by Mandeville; but these might have been sent from Liège, and it will appear later that the Liège physician possessed and wrote about precious stones. St Albans also had a legend, recorded in John Norden's \"Speculum Britanniae\" (1596) that a ruined marble tomb of Mandeville (represented cross-legged and in armour, with sword and shield) once stood in the abbey; this may be true of \"Mangevilayn\" or it may be apocryphal. There is also an inscription near the entrance of St Albans Abbey, which reads as follows:\n\nThe book may contain facts and knowledge acquired by actual travels and residence in the East, at least in the section which treats of the Holy Land and the ways of getting thither, of Egypt, and in general of the Levant. The prologue points almost exclusively to the Holy Land as the subject of the work. The mention of more distant regions comes in only towards the end of this prologue, and (in a manner) as an afterthought. However, this is commensurate with Mandeville's emphasis on 'curiositas'—wandering—rather than Christian 'scientia' (knowledge).\n\nThe greater part of these more distant travels, extending from Trebizond to Hormuz, India, the Malay Archipelago, and China, and back to western Asia, has been appropriated from the narrative of Friar Odoric (1330). These passages are almost always swollen with interpolated particulars, usually of an extravagant kind. However, in a number of cases the writer has failed to understand those passages which he adopts from Odoric and professes to give as his own experiences. Thus, where Odoric has given a most curious and veracious account of the Chinese custom of employing tame cormorants to catch fish, the cormorants are converted by Mandeville into \"little beasts called loyres which are taught to go into the water\" (the word \"loyre\" being apparently used here for \"otter\", \"lutra\", for which the Provençal is \"luria\" or \"loiria\").\n\nAt a very early date the coincidence of Mandeville's stories with those of Odoric was recognized, insomuch that a manuscript of Odoric which is or was in the chapter library at Mainz begins with the words: \"Incipit Itinerarius fidelis fratris Odorici socii Militis Mendavil per Indian; licet hic ille prius et alter posterius peregrinationem suam descripsit\". At a later day Sir Thomas Herbert calls Odoric \"travelling companion of our Sir John\"; and Samuel Purchas, most unfairly, whilst calling Mandeville, next to Polo, \"if next ... the greatest Asian traveller that ever the world had\", insinuates that Odoric's story was stolen from Mandeville's. Mandeville himself is crafty enough, at least in one passage, to anticipate criticism by suggesting the probability of his having travelled with Odoric.\n\nMuch of Mandeville's matter, particularly in Asiatic geography and history, is taken from the \"La Flor des Estoires d'Orient\" of Hetoum, an Armenian of princely family, who became a monk of the Praemonstrant or Premonstratensian order, and in 1307 dictated this work on the East, in the French tongue at Poitiers, out of his own extraordinary acquaintance with Asia and its history in his own time. A story of the fortress at Corycus, or the Castle Sparrowhawk, appears in Mandeville's Book.\n\nNo passage in Mandeville can be plausibly traced to Marco Polo, with one exception. This is where he states that at Hormuz the people during the great heat lie in water – a circumstance mentioned by Polo, though not by Odoric. It is most likely that this fact had been interpolated in the copy of Odoric used by Mandeville, for if he had borrowed it directly from Polo he could have borrowed more.\n\nA good deal about the manners and customs of the Tatars is demonstrably derived from the work of the Franciscan Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, who went as the pope's ambassador to the Tatars in 1245–1247; but Dr. Warner considers that the immediate source for Mandeville was the \"Speculum historiale\" of Vincent de Beauvais. Though the passages in question are all to be found in Carpine more or less exactly, the expression is condensed and the order changed. For examples compare Mandeville, p. 250, on the tasks done by Tatar women, with Carpine, p. 643; Mandeville. p. 250, on Tatar habits of eating, with Carpine, pp. 639–640; Mandeville, p. 231, on the titles borne on the seals of the Great Khan, with Carpine, p. 715, etc.\n\nThe account of Prester John is taken from the famous \"Epistle\" of that imaginary potentate, which was widely diffused in the 13th century. Many fabulous stories, again, of monsters, such as cyclopes, sciapodes, hippopodes, anthropophagi, monoscelides, and men whose heads did grow beneath their shoulders; of the phoenix and the weeping crocodile, such as Pliny has collected, are introduced here and there, derived no doubt from him, Solinus, the bestiaries, or the \"Speculum naturale\" of Vincent de Beauvais. And interspersed, especially in the chapters about the Levant, are the stories and legends that were retailed to every pilgrim, such as the legend of Seth and the grains of paradise from which grew the wood of the cross, that of the shooting of old Cain by Lamech, that of the castle of the sparrow-hawk (which appears in the tale of Melusine), those of the origin of the balsam plants at Masariya, of the dragon of Cos, of the river Sambation, etc.\n\nEven in that part of the book which might be supposed to represent some genuine experience, there are the plainest traces that another work has been made use of, more or less—we might almost say as a framework to fill up. This is the itinerary of the German knight Wilhelm von Boldensele, written in 1336 at the desire of Cardinal Hélie de Talleyrand-Périgord. A cursory comparison of this with Mandeville leaves no doubt that the latter has followed its thread, though digressing on every side, and too often eliminating the singular good sense of the German traveler. We may indicate as examples Boidensele's account of Cyprus, of Tyre and the coast of Palestine, of the journey from Gaza to Egypt, passages about Babylon of Egypt, about Mecca, the general account of Egypt, the pyramids, some of the wonders of Cairo, such as the slave-market, the chicken-hatching stoves, and the apples of paradise, i.e. plantains, the Red Sea, the convent on Sinai, the account of the church of the Holy Sepulchre, etc.\n\nAs an example, when discussing the pyramids, Boldensele wrote that \"the people of the country call them Pharaoh's Granaries. But this cannot be true at all, for no place for putting in the wheat can be found there\". Mandeville then completely reverses it in favor of the received medieval opinion: \"Some say that they are tombs of the great lords of antiquity, but that is not true, for the common word through the whole country near and far is that they are Joseph's Granaries ... [for] if they were tombs, they would not be empty inside\".\n\nThere is, indeed, only a small residuum of the book to which genuine character, as containing the experiences of the author, can possibly be attributed. Yet, as has been intimated, the borrowed stories are frequently claimed as such experiences. In addition to those already mentioned, he alleges that he had witnessed the curious exhibition of the garden of transmigrated souls (described by Odoric) at Cansay, i.e. Hangchow. He and his fellows with their valets had remained fifteen months in service with the emperor of Cathay in his wars against the king of Manzi – Manzi, or Southern China, having ceased to be a separate kingdom some seventy years before the time referred to. But the most notable of these false statements occurs in his adoption from Odoric of the story of the \"Valley Perilous\". This is, in its original form, apparently founded on real experiences of Odoric viewed through a haze of excitement and superstition. Mandeville, whilst swelling the wonders of the tale with a variety of extravagant touches, appears to safeguard himself from the reader's possible discovery that it was stolen by the interpolation: \"And some of our fellows accorded to enter, and some not. So there were with us two worthy men, Friars Minor, that were of Lombardy, who said that if any man would enter they would go in with us. And when they had said so, upon the gracious trust of God and of them, we caused mass to be sung, and made every man to be shriven and houselled; and then we entered fourteen persons; but at our going out we were but nine\", etc.\n\nIn referring to this passage, it is only fair to recognize that the description (though the suggestion of the greatest part exists in Odoric) displays a good deal of imaginative power; and there is much in the account of Christian's passage through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, in John Bunyan's famous allegory, which indicates a possibility that Bunyan may have read and remembered this episode either in Mandeville or in Hakluyt's \"Odoric\".\n\nNor does it follow that the whole work is borrowed or fictitious. Even the great Moorish traveller Ibn Battuta, accurate and veracious in the main, seems—in one part at least of his narrative—to invent experiences; and, in such works as those of Jan van Hees and Arnold von Harff, we have examples of pilgrims to the Holy Land whose narratives begin apparently in sober truth, and gradually pass into flourishes of fiction and extravagance. So in Mandeville also we find particulars not yet traced to other writers, and which may therefore be provisionally assigned either to the writer's own experience or to knowledge acquired by colloquial intercourse in the East.\n\nWhether Mandeville actually traveled or not, he would not necessarily be intentionally making the story up. All travel narratives from this time used the same sources, taken from each other or from the earlier traditions of the Greeks. This tradition was an integral part of such narratives to make them believable (or at least acceptable) to the readers. Columbus was to make use of some of the same monsters in \"India\" that Mandeville did with the intention of winning the support of the king.\n\nIt is difficult to decide on the character of his statements as to recent Egyptian history. In his account of that country, though the series of the Comanian (of the Bahri dynasty) sultans is borrowed from Hetoum down to the accession of Mel echnasser (Al-Nasir Muhammad), who came first to the throne in 1293, Mandeville appears to speak from his own knowledge when he adds that this \"Melechnasser reigned long and governed wisely\". In fact, though twice displaced in the early part of his life, Al-Nasir Muhammad reigned till 1341, a duration unparalleled in Muslim Egypt, whilst we are told that during the last thirty years of his reign, Egypt rose to a high pitch of wealth and prosperity.\n\nMandeville, however, then goes on to say that his eldest son, Melechemader, was chosen to succeed; but this prince was caused privily to be slain by his brother, who took the kingdom under the name of Meleclimadabron. \"And he was Soldan when I departed from those countries\". Now Al-Nasir Muhammad was followed in succession by no less than eight of his sons in thirteen years, the first three of whom reigned in aggregate only a few months. The names mentioned by Mandeville appear to represent those of the fourth and sixth of the eight, viz. al-Salih Ismail, and al-Muzzafar Hajji]; and these the statements of Mandeville do not fit.\n\nOn several occasions, Arabic words are given, but are not always recognizable, owing perhaps to the carelessness of copyists in such matters. Thus, we find the names (not satisfactorily identified) of the wood, fruit and sap of the Himalayan Balsam; of bitumen, \"alkatran\" (\"al-Kāṭrān\"); of the three different kinds of pepper (long pepper, black pepper and white pepper) as \"sorbotin, fulful\" and \"bano\" or \"bauo\" (\"fulful\" is the common Arabic word for pepper; the others have not been satisfactorily explained). But these, and the particulars of his narrative for which no literary sources have yet been found, are too few to constitute a proof of personal experience.\n\nMandeville, again, in some passages shows a correct idea of the form of the earth, and of position in latitude ascertained by observation of the pole star; he knows that there are antipodes, and that if ships were sent on voyages of discovery they might sail round the world. And he tells a curious story, which he had heard in his youth, how a worthy man did travel ever eastward until he came to his own country again. But he repeatedly asserts the old belief that Jerusalem was in the centre of the world, and maintains in proof of this that at the equinox a spear planted erect in Jerusalem casts no shadow at noon, which, if true, would equally consist with the sphericity of the earth, provided that the city were on the equator.\n\nThe sources of the book, which include various authors besides those included in this article specified, have been laboriously investigated by Albert Bovenschen and George F. Warner. The oldest known manuscript of the original—once Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Barrois's, afterwards Bertram Ashburnham, 4th Earl of Ashburnham's, now \"Nouv. Acq. Franc. 1515\" in the Bibliothèque nationale de France—is dated 1371, but is nevertheless very inaccurate in proper names. An early printed Latin translation made from the French has been already quoted, but four others, unprinted, have been discovered by Dr Johann Vogels. They exist in eight manuscripts, of which seven are in Great Britain, while the eighth was copied by a monk of Abingdon; probably, therefore, all these unprinted translations were executed in Great Britain. \n\nFrom one of them, according to Dr Vogels, an English version was made which has never been printed and is now extant only in free abbreviations, contained in two 15th-century manuscripts in the Bodleian Library—manuscript \"e Museo 116\", and manuscript \"Rawlinson D.99\": the former, which is the better, is in East Midlands English, and may possibly have belonged to the Augustinian priory of St Osyth in Essex, while the latter is in Southern Middle English.\n\nThe first English translation direct from the French was made (at least as early as the beginning of the 15th century) from a manuscript of which many pages were lost. Writing of the name 'Califfes', the author says that it is \"taut a dire come rol (s). II y soleit auoir V. soudans\" \"as much as to say king. There used to be 5 sultans\". In the defective French manuscript a page ended with \"Il y so\"; then came a gap, and the next page went on with part of the description of Mount Sinai, \"Et est celle vallee mult froide\". Consequently, the corresponding English version has \"That ys to say amonge hem \"Roys Ils\" and this vale ys ful colde\"! All English printed texts before 1725, and Ashton's 1887 edition, follow these defective copies, and in only two known manuscripts has the lacuna been detected and filled up.\n\nOne of them is the British Museum manuscript \"Egerton 1982\" (Northern dialect, about 1410–1420 ?), in which, according to Vogels, the corresponding portion has been borrowed from that English version which had already been made from the Latin. The other is in the, British Museum manuscript \"Cotton Titus xvi.\" (Midland dialect, about 1410–1420?), representing a text completed, and revised throughout, from the French, though not by a competent hand. The \"Egerton text\", edited by George Warner, has been printed by the Roxburghe Club, while the Cotton text, first printed in 1725-27, is in modern reprints the current English version.\n\nThat none of the forms of the English version can be from the same hand which wrote the original is made patent by their glaring errors of translation, but the Cotton text asserts in the preface that it was made by Mandeville himself, and this assertion was till lately taken on trust by almost all modern historians of English literature. The words of the original \"je eusse cest livret mis en latin ... mais ... je l'ay mis en rōmant\" were mistranslated as if \"je eusse\" meant \"I had\" instead of \"I should have\", and then (whether of fraudulent intent or by the error of a copyist thinking to supply an accidental omission) the words were added \"and translated it aȝen out of Frensche into Englyssche.\" Mätzner seems to have been the first to show that the current English text cannot possibly have been made by Mandeville himself. Of the original French there is no satisfactory edition, but Vogels has undertaken a critical text, and Warner has added to his Egerton English text the French of a British Museum MS. with variants from three others.\n\nAn illuminated Middle English copy c. 1440, possibly from Bersted, Kent, fetched £289,250 at a London auction in June 2011.\n\nIt remains to mention certain other works bearing the name of Mandeville or de Bourgogne.\n\nMS. Add. C. 280 in the Bodleian appends to the \"Travels\" a short French life of St Alban of Germany, the author of which calls himself Johan Mandivill[e], knight, formerly of the town of St Alban, and says he writes to correct an impression prevalent among his countrymen that there was no other saint of the name: this life is followed by part of a French herbal.\n\nTo Mandeville (by whom de Bourgogne is clearly meant) Jean d'Outremeuse ascribes a Latin \"lappidaire selon l'oppinion des Indois\", from which he quotes twelve passages, stating that the author (whom he calls knight, lord of Montfort, of Castelperouse, and of the isle of Campdi) had been \"baillez en Alexandrie\" seven years, and had been presented by a Saracen friend with some fine jewels which had passed into d'Outremeuse's own possession: of this Lapidaire, a French version, which seems to have been completed after 1479, has been several times printed. A manuscript of Mandeville's travels offered for sale in 1862 is said to have been divided into five books:\nwhile the cataloguer supposed Mandeville to have been the author of a concluding piece entitled \"La Venianche de nostre Signeur Jhesu-Crist fayle par Vespasian fit del empereur de Romme et commeet lozeph daramathye fu deliures de la prizon\". From the treatise on herbs a passage is quoted asserting it to have been composed in 1357 in honour of the author's natural lord, Edward III, king of England. This date is corroborated by the title of king of Scotland given to Edward, who had received from Baliol the surrender of the crown and kingly dignity on 20 January 1356, but on 3 October 1357 released King David and made peace with Scotland: unfortunately it is not recorded whether the treatise contains the author's name, and, if so, what name.\n\nTanner (\"Bibliotheca\") alleges that Mandeville wrote several books on medicine, and among the \"Ashmolean manuscripts\" in the Bodleian Library are a medical receipt by John de Magna Villa (No. 2479), an aichemical receipt by him (No. 1407), and another alchemical receipt by johannes de Villa Magna (No. 1441).\n\nFinally, de Bourgogne wrote under his own name a treatise on the plague, extant in Latin, French and English texts, and in Latin and English abridgments. Herein he describes himself as Johannes de Burgundia, otherwise called cum Barba, citizen of Liège and professor of the art of medicine; says that he had practised forty years and had been in Liège in the plague of 1365; and adds that he had previously written a treatise on the cause of the plague, according to the indications of astrology (beginning \"Deus deorum\"), and another on distinguishing pestilential diseases (beginning \"Cum nimium propter instans tempus epidimiate\"). \"Burgundia\" is sometimes corrupted into \"Burdegalia\", and in English translations of the abridgment almost always appears as \"Burdews\" (Bordeaux, France) or the like manuscript \"Rawlinson D. 251\" (15th century) in the Bodleian Library also contains a large number of English medical receipts, headed \"Practica phisicalia Magistri Johannis de Burgundia\".\n\n\n\nAttribution\n\n\n"}

Palatnik initially created electro-mechanical devices, based on the kaleidoscopic principle, which projected a constantly changing pattern of coloured light on a screen. Later devices exposed coloured moving parts of the machinery. In all cases, the shape and colour observed were changed by the devices for a stationary observer. Frank Popper, the eminent art historian, among others, commented on Palatnik's \"luminous mobiles\" and their aesthetic of motion.\n\nMore recently, the term has been applied to the work of Ian Nunn, a Canadian computer scientist and artist who has done extensive work in the application of interference pigments and films to 2-dimensional painting surfaces. These special effect pigments, such as ChromaFlair, exhibit strong directional spectral reflectance and colour shifting with the angle of view. In Nunn's work, the viewer moves while the painting remains stationary. Elements in the picture change colour, appear and disappear as both the angle of viewing and the angle of illumination change.\n\n"}

It is the language of the Lak people from the Russian autonomous republic of Dagestan, where it is one of six standardized languages. It is spoken by about 157,000 people.\n\nIn 1864 Russian ethnographer and linguist P. K. Uslar wrote: \"Kazikumukh grammar or as I called it for short in the native language, the Lak grammar, Lakku maz, the Lak language, is ready\".\n\nIn 1890 a textbook was published on Lak grammar compiled by P.K. Uslar named as \"The Lak Language\". It stated under the title \"Lak alphabet\": \"The proposed alphabet is written for people who name themselves collectively Lak, genitive Lakral. From among these people each one is named separately Lakkuchu 'Lakian man,' the woman — Lakkusharssa 'Lakian woman.' Their homeland they name Lakral kIanu — 'Lak place.'\"\n\nLak has throughout the centuries adopted a number of loanwords from Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and Russian. Ever since Dagestan was part of the USSR and later Russia, the largest portion of loanwords have come from Russian, especially political and technical vocabulary. There is a newspaper and broadcasting station in Lak language.\n\nIn accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Dagestan of 1994, Lak language was named as the state language along with Russian and some other major languages spoken in Dagestan (about 20 local languages are unwritten and have no official status). Lak language is used as a teaching tool in elementary school and taught as a subject in secondary schools, vocational schools and universities. There is a Lak newspaper, \"Ilchi\".\n\nThe standard Lak language is based on the dialect of the city of Kumukh. This city should not be confused with the Kumyk ethnic group, a Turkic people also present in the Caucasus. To sum up, the Lak language has the following dialects: \"Kumukh, Vitskhi, Arakul, Balkhar, Shadni, Shalib, Vikhli, Kuli, and Kaya\".\n\nInitially Lak language by lexicon was found to be close to Dargin language and the two were often combined in one Lak-Dargin subgroup of Dagestani languages. However, further research has led the scientists to conclude that this association was weak.\n\n\nFive vowels are presented as [a, e, i, o, u].\n\nLak is one of the few North East Caucasian languages with verbal agreement for person. It generally only distinguishes only between speech-act participants and non-speech-act participants. In other words, the first- and second-person agreement markers are the same.\n\nThe free pronouns of Lak do distinguish first and second person.\n\nThe Lak language was written using the Arabic script until 1928. Afterwards it was written with a Latin alphabet for ten years, and since 1938 it has been written in Cyrillic.\n\nThe Lak alphabet in Cyrillic initially included 48 letters and later 54 letters with double letters as \"тт\", \"пп\", \"чч\", \"хьхь\", etc.:\n\n"}

The exponent of this lifestyle, the \"malandro\" (masculine adjective), or \"bad boy\" (rogue, hustler, rascal, scoundrel), has become significant to Brazilian national identity as a folk hero or, rather, an anti-hero. It is common in Brazilian literature, Brazilian cinema and Brazilian music.\n\nA \"malandro\" could be defined as someone who:\n\nMalandragem is defined as an aggregation of strategies utilized in order to gain advantage in a determined situation, these advantages often being illicit. It is characterized by savoir faire and subtlety. Its execution demands aptitude, charisma, cunning and whatever other characteristics (knacks) which help in the manipulation of people or institutions to obtain the best outcome in the easiest possible way. \n\nDisconsidering logical argumentation, labor and honesty, the malandro presupposes that such methods are incapable of getting him a good outcome. Those who practice malandragem act in the manner of the popular Brazilian adage, immortalized in a catch phrase of former Brazilian soccer player Gérson de Oliveira Nunes in a cigarette TV commercial (hence the name it was given: Lei de Gérson, or Gérson's law): “I like to get an advantage in everything.”\n\nTogether with the concept of jeitinho, malandragem can be considered another typical — but not exclusive — Brazilian mode of social navigation; unlike jeitinho, however, with malandragem the integrity of institutions and individuals is effectively attacked, legally speaking, as malicious. Successful malandragem is gaining advantage under the condition of not being caught. Basically, the malandro dupes the target without them knowing they have been tricked.\n\nMalandragem is characterized in the Brazilian popular imagination as a tool for individual justice. Facing the forces of oppressive institutions, the individualist malandro survives by manipulating people, fooling authorities and sidestepping laws in a way which guarantees his well-being. In this way, the malandro is a typical Brazilian hero. Literary examples include Pedro Malasarte and João Grilo.\n\nLike jeitinho, malandragem is an intellectual resource utilized by individuals of little social influence or by the socially disadvantaged. This does not stop the equal use of malandragem by those of better social positions. Through malandragem, one gains illicit advantages in gambling, business, and in the totality of their social life. One can consider a malandro the adulterer who convinces a woman of his false fidelity; the employer who finds a way to pay his employees less than what he owes; the player who manipulates his cards and wins the round.\n\nBut, despite this apparent egocentrical, lying and malicious nature, the person who makes use of \"malandragem\" is not necessarily selfish. He could possibly be lazy, but the malandro is not careless with the people around him. He generally doesn't make use of \"malandragem\" to take advantage of another person intending to harm others, but rather only to find a way out of an unfair situation even if this means resorting to illegal methods. In fictional contexts, \"malandragem\" is often a device used to introduce wit, a typical plot device/characteristic of an antihero.\n\n"}

{"id": "7421027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7421027", "title": "Morris Birkbeck", "text": "Morris Birkbeck\n\nMorris Birkbeck (January 23, 1764 – June 4, 1825) was an English agricultural innovator, author/publicist, anti-slavery campaigner and early 19th-century pioneer in southern Illinois, in the United States. With George Flower he founded the English Settlement and the town of Albion, Illinois, and served briefly as the Secretary of State of Illinois.\n\nBirkbeck was born at Settle, England, the son of an influential Quaker also named Morris Birkbeck, and his wife Hannah Bradford. He is of the same Birkbeck family as George Birkbeck (1776-1841), doctor, educationalist, philanthropist, reformer, and founder of Birkbeck College, London, and the Mechanics' Institutes; and of John Birkbeck (1817-1890), a Yorkshire banker, alpinist, and pioneer potholer.\n\nBy 1794, as leaseholder, Birkbeck was farming an estate of at Wanborough, Surrey, where he joined others in England and France who were experimenting with crossbreeding Merino sheep. On April 24, 1794, Birkbeck married Prudence Bush, daughter of Richard and Prudence Bush of Wandsworth, Surrey. After ten years of marriage, Prudence died from the complications of childbirth on October 25, 1804, leaving her husband with seven children. Birkbeck remained a widower for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1814, accompanied by his friend and fellow Merino sheep breeder George Flower (1788-1862), son of Richard Flower, Birkbeck traveled in recently defeated France. His \"Notes on a Journey through France\" (1814) revealed a good-tempered, fair-minded observer, well grounded in science and the humanities. A radical in both politics and religion, Birkbeck was increasingly annoyed at being taxed by a government that denied him a vote because of his religion and that also required him to be tithed by a church he did not believe in and held in contempt. In London, Birkbeck met Edward Coles, President James Madison's secretary who had been sent on a diplomatic mission to Europe. Coles had recently travelled into what was then the newly formed Illinois Territory, and extolled its virtues as well as proclaimed his intent to move there. In early 1817, with a party consisting chiefly of his children and wards, Birkbeck emigrated to the United States. George Flower had emigrated first, leaving his wife and two young sons in England in 1816, and had spent most of the previous winter with former President Thomas Jefferson at Monticello, as well as with Coles' family in Virginia. Flower, Birkbeck and their fellow English idealists jointly headed west in search of land on which to settle and try to establish a utopian community.\n\nDuring 1817–18 Birkbeck began preparing for their scheme by buying about of public land in the far south of Edwards County, in the Illinois Territory. Flower returned to England to organize emigrants, raise money for the venture, and arrange for his father's family to emigrate. Birkbeck and Flower hoped to establish a new community in the sparsely-settled Wabash River Valley where English men and women would be able to escape the economic and political tyranny they believed England had become. Both men had close family ties to Britain's radical political and religious establishment.\n\nBirkbeck published \"Notes on a Journey in America from the Coast of Virginia to the Territory of Illinois\" (1817), first in Philadelphia, then in London, Dublin, and Cork. An account of the party's emigration travel experiences, with vague references to their plans for establishing a wilderness sanctuary, it became immensely popular, with its promise of improving the lives of downtrodden working and middle-class Europeans. It ran through eleven editions in English in two years, and was published in German at Jena (1818), and translated into Swedish by Georg Scheutz (1818) Birkbeck's follow-up, \"Letters from Illinois\" (1818), published in Boston, Philadelphia, and London, went through seven editions in English, besides being translated in 1819 into French and German.\n\nThe radical nature of the anti-clerical and anti-aristocratic vision presented in Birkbeck's writings frightened Britain's conservative establishment, even as it excited thousands to dream of following him to the Illinois prairies. A pamphlet war ensued, where pundits, editors and ordinary folk debated the merits of Birkbeck and Flower's radical political statement and reform efforts, thrusting the two men before the Anglo-American reading public, while English emigrants and their investigating agents headed for \"The English Prairie\" to ascertain the truth of the settlement's prospects.\n\nBut soon Birkbeck and Flower became estranged, ostensibly over George Flower's bigamous marriage to Eliza Julia Andrews. She was the orphaned niece of John Towill Rutt (an English political activist, social reformer, nonconformist man of letters, and Joseph Priestley's biographer). Eliza had accompanied the Birkbeck family from England to Illinois, possibly because Flowers' father, who emigrated with him and two brothers and two sisters, knew that their romance had broken up Flower's adolescent marriage to his first cousin Jane Dawson. Divorce was also difficult to obtain in England, and while an Indiana Justice of the Peace married Eliza and George in 1817, George didn't receive an Illinois marriage license for his union with Eliza until after receiving a special Illinois legislative divorce from Jane in 1836, long after their first child (a daughter) was born in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, but before their son became a minister. Birkbeck never approved of George and Eliza's romance, whether on moral grounds, or because he had hoped to marry his ward himself. Soon, the disaffection between the male leaders affected the English Settlement as a whole.\n\nIn 1818 Birkbeck laid out the town of Wanborough, and Flower, whose 1500 acres adjoined Birkbeck's, laid out the town of Albion nearby. The men never reconciled, nor ever again directly spoke to one another. Initial hopes both had for the venture were extinguished as factions formed and conflict abounded.\n\nBirkbeck became president of Illinois' first agricultural society. He promoted scientific farming techniques, especially concerning livestock, although his Illinois neighbors initially ridiculed him for sowing only a half acre of potatoes and breaking his plow the first year, particularly since Birkbeck had predicted that he could cultivate 100 acres of maize from the hard-packed prairie.\n\nLong involved in abolitionism in England, Birkbeck assisted his London acquaintance Edward Coles - who had become the second governor of Illinois - in working against slavery in Illinois, particularly during an attempt to legalize the 'peculiar institution' in the new state. In 1823, Birkbeck, through newspaper articles under the pen name \"Jonathan Freeman,\" helped to consolidate the antislavery forces in Illinois and ensure that it remained a free state. In 1824, Coles appointed Birkbeck as Secretary of State of Illinois. Birkbeck served for three months, but was turned out when the proslavery majority in the state Senate refused to confirm his appointment. Albion also became the Edwards county seat, although residents of Mount Carmel across the river attempted to retrieve some court records by force, and ultimately succeeded in splitting off their area as Wabash County, Illinois. The outcome made Edwards County the fourth smallest county in Illinois.\n\nOn June 4, 1825, while returning on horseback from a visit to Welsh industrialist and social reformer Robert Owen at New Harmony, Indiana, Birkbeck drowned trying to cross the rain-swollen Fox River, a tributary of the Wabash River. He was sixty one years old. He had been travelling with his twenty-three-year-old son Bradford Birkbeck, as well as Judge James O. Wattles and other 'English Prairie' residents, who were interested in Owen's newly proposed utopian community at New Harmony.\n\nMorris Birkbeck's death devastated the settlement, and his sons and daughters were left at loose ends. They soon formed an Owenite society at Wanborough, but it was short-lived because they could not maintain its economic viability. All that remains of Morris Birkbeck's settlement at Wanborough, Illinois is the cemetery, with an Illinois historical marker. But Albion prospered through the years, and remains the county seat of one of the smallest counties in the state of Illinois. Also, an unincorporated community in central Illinois takes the name of the pioneer reformer: Birkbeck, Illinois.\n\nPioneering American journalist and early women's rights advocate Margaret Fuller lauded Birkbeck in her book \"Summer on the Lakes\" (1844), praising him for his generous communal vision, and recounting the sad circumstances of his death. Ironically, she herself also drowned tragically, in a shipwreck off Fire Island, New York, in 1850.\n\nBirkbeck's eldest son Richard eventually moved to New Harmony, where he died a broken man in 1839. Sons Bradford and Charles, and the families of daughters Eliza and Prudence, emigrated to Zacatecas, Mexico, where Bradford and Charles managed English silver mines. Prudence, who left her husband Frances Hanks at the Prairie settlement, died of cholera in 1833, and Bradford took in her three orphaned daughters Clara, Lucy, and Caroline.\n\nBirkbeck's daughter Eliza (1797-1880) married Gilbert Titus Pell (1796-1860), who came from a prominent family of New York politicians. Gilbert Pell served as representative in the Illinois legislature and was appointed United States envoy to Mexico in the 1850s. He was descended from Sir John Pell (1643-1702), Lord of Pelham Manor, New York, who was the son of English mathematician Dr. John Pell, and nephew and heir of early American settler and pioneer Thomas Pell.\nEliza became estranged from her husband, and returned to England with their son Morris Birkbeck Pell. Morris Pell studied mathematics at Cambridge University, where he graduated as Senior Wrangler (top mathematics undergraduate), in 1849. In 1852 he emigrated with his family to the British colony of New South Wales (Australia), to become the inaugural Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at the newly opened Sydney University.\n\nAfter several years of mining management in Mexico, Bradford and Charles Birkbeck also emigrated to Australia, to raise sheep at their pioneer settlement at Rockhampton, in Queensland. Glenmore Homestead (originally about one hundred and twenty five square miles), is today still worked by the descendants of Samuel Bradford (\"SB\") Birkbeck.\n"}

{"id": "22118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22118", "title": "Norn language", "text": "Norn language\n\nNorn is an extinct North Germanic language that was spoken in the Northern Isles (Orkney and Shetland) off the north coast of mainland Scotland and in Caithness in the far north of the Scottish mainland. After Orkney and Shetland were pledged to Scotland by Norway in 1468–69, it was gradually replaced by Scots. Norn became extinct in 1850, after the death of Walter Sutherland, the language's last known speaker.\n\nNorse settlement in the islands probably began in the early 9th century. These settlers are believed to have arrived in very substantial numbers and like those who migrated to Iceland and the Faroe Islands it is probable that most came from the west coast of Norway. Shetland toponymy bears some resemblance to that of northwest Norway, while Norn vocabulary implies links with more southerly Norwegian regions.\n\nOrkney and Shetland were pledged to James III in 1468 and 1469 respectively, and it is with these pledges that the replacement of Norn with Scots is most associated. However, the decline of Norse speech in Orkney probably began in 1379 when the earldom passed into the hands of the Sinclairs, and Scots had superseded Norse as the language of prestige on the island by the early 15th century. In Shetland the transition began later, but by the end of the 15th century both island groups were bilingual. Despite this, the process by which Scots overtook Norn as the primary spoken language on the islands was not a swift one, and most natives of Orkney and Shetland likely spoke Norn as a first language until the late 16th and early-to-mid 17th centuries respectively.\n\nIt is not known exactly when Norn became extinct. Sources from the 17th and 18th centuries speak of Norn (sometimes identified as \"Norse\", \"Norwegian\" or \"Danish\") as being in a state of decline and generally indicate that the language remained stronger in Shetland than in Orkney. A source from 1670 states that there are \"only three or four parishes\" in Orkney where people speak \"Noords or rude Danish\" and that they do so \"chiefly when they are at their own houses\". Another from 1701 indicates that there were still a few monoglot \"Norse\" speakers who were capable of speaking \"no other thing,\" and notes that there were more speakers of the language in Shetland than in Orkney. It was said in 1703 that the people of Shetland generally spoke Scots, but that \"many among them retain the ancient Danish Language\"; while in 1750 Orkney-born James Mackenzie wrote that Norn was not yet entirely extinct, being \"retained by old people,\" who still spoke it among each other.\n\nThe last reports of Norn speakers are claimed to be from the 19th century, but it is more likely that the language was dying out in the late 18th century. The isolated islands of Foula and Unst are variously claimed as the last refuges of the language in Shetland, where there were people \"who could repeat sentences in Norn, probably passages from folk songs or poems, as late as 1893. Walter Sutherland from Skaw in Unst, who died about 1850, has been cited as the last native speaker of the Norn language. However, fragments of vocabulary survived the death of the main language and remain to this day, mainly in place-names and terms referring to plants, animals, weather, mood, and fishing vocabulary.\n\nNorn had also been a spoken language in Caithness but had probably become extinct there by the 15th century, replaced by Scots. Hence, some scholars also speak about \"Caithness Norn\", but others avoid this. Even less is known about \"Caithness Norn\" than about Orkney and Shetland Norn. Almost no written Norn has survived, but what little remains includes a version of the Lord's Prayer and a ballad, \"Hildina\". Michael P Barnes, professor of Scandinavian Studies at University College London, has published a study, \"The Norn Language of Orkney and Shetland\".\n\nNorn is an Indo-European language belonging to the North Germanic branch of the Germanic languages. Together with Faroese, Icelandic and Norwegian, it belongs to the West Scandinavian group, separating it from the East Scandinavian group consisting of Swedish, Danish and Gutnish. While this classification is based on the differences between the North Germanic languages at the time they split, their present-day characteristics justify another classification, dividing them into Insular Scandinavian and Mainland Scandinavian language groups based on mutual intelligibility. Under this system, Norwegian is grouped together with Danish and Swedish, because the last millennium has seen all three undergo important changes, especially in grammar and lexis, which have set them apart from Faroese and Icelandic. Norn is generally considered to have been fairly similar to Faroese, sharing many phonological and grammatical traits, and might even have been mutually intelligible with it; thus, it can be considered an Insular Scandinavian language.\n\nFew written texts remain. It is distinct from the present day dialect of Shetland, Shetland Scots, which evolved from Middle English.\n\nThe phonology of Norn can never be determined with much precision due to the lack of source material, but the general aspects can be extrapolated from the few written sources that do exist. Norn shared many traits with the dialects of southwest Norway. This includes a voicing of to before or between vowels and (in the Shetland dialect, but only partially in the Orkney dialect) a conversion of and (\"thing\" and \"that\" respectively) to and respectively.\n\nThe features of Norn grammar were very similar to the other Scandinavian languages. There were two numbers, three genders and four cases (nominative, accusative, genitive and dative). The two main conjugations of verbs in present and past tense were also present and like all other North Germanic languages, it used a suffix instead of a prepositioned article to indicate definiteness as in modern Scandinavian: ' (\"man\"); ' (\"the man\"). Though it is difficult to be certain of many of the aspects of Norn grammar, documents indicate that it may have featured subjectless clauses, which were common in the West Scandinavian languages.\n\nThe following are Norn and Old Norse versions of the Lord's Prayer:\n\nA Shetland \"guddick\" (riddle) in Norn, which Jakob Jakobsen heard told on Unst, the northernmost island in Shetland, in the 1890s. The same riddle is also known from the Faroe Islands, Norway, Iceland, and a variation also occurs in England.\nThe answer is a cow: four nipples hang, four legs walk, two horns and two ears stand skyward, two eyes show the way to the field and one tail comes shaking (dangling) behind.\n\nMost of the use of Norn/Norse in modern-day Shetland and Orkney is purely ceremonial, and mostly in Old Norse, for example the Shetland motto, which is \"\" (\"with law shall land be built\") which is the same motto used by the Icelandic police force and inspired by the old Norwegian Frostathing Law.\n\nAnother example of the use of Norse/Norn in the Northern Isles can be found in the names of ferries:\n\nNorn words are still used to describe many of the colour and pattern variations in the native sheep of Shetland and Orkney, which survive as the Shetland and North Ronaldsay breeds. Icelandic uses similar words for many of the same colour variations in Icelandic sheep.\n\nThere are some enthusiasts who are engaged in developing and disseminating a modern form called Nynorn (\"New Norn\"), based upon linguistic analysis of the known records and Norse linguistics in general.\n\n\n\n"}

Additionally, Toei has developed thirteen animated feature films, one OVA and eleven television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004, before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.\n\n\"One Piece\" has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. The official website for Eiichiro Oda's \"One Piece\" manga announced that the manga has set a \"Guinness World Record\" for \"the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\". As of May 2018, the manga has sold over 440 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series in history. It became the best-selling manga for the tenth consecutive year in 2017.\n\nThe series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man who, inspired by his childhood idol and powerful pirate \"Red Haired\" Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the famed treasure One Piece and proclaim himself the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the , Luffy rescues and befriends a swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the One Piece. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a navigator and thief; Usopp, a sniper and a liar; and Sanji, a womanizing chef. They acquire a ship named the \"Going Merry\" and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, a doctor and anthropomorphized reindeer; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeletal musician; and Jimbei, a fishman helmsman; and they also acquire a new ship named the \"Thousand Sunny\".\n\nThe world of \"One Piece\" is populated by humans and many other races such as \"fishmen\" (a race of fish/human hybrids, similar to mermen and mermaids), dwarves, Minkmen (a race of humanoid animals), and giants. It is covered by two vast oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain range called the , which is also the only continent in the world. The , a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides them into four seas: , , and . Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions called , similar to horse latitudes, which experience almost no wind or ocean currents and are the breeding ground for huge sea creatures called . Because of this, the calm belts are very effective barriers for those trying to enter the Grand Line. However, navy ships, members of an intergovernmental organization known as the World Government, are able to use a to mask their presence from the sea kings and can simply pass through the calm belts. All other ships are forced to take a more dangerous route, going through a mountain at the first intersection of the Grand Line and the Red Line, a canal system known as . Sea water from each of the four seas runs up that mountain and merges at the top to flow down a fifth canal and into the first half of the Grand Line. The second half of the Grand Line, beyond the second intersection with the Red Line, is known as the .\n\nThe currents and weather of the Grand Line's open sea are extremely unpredictable, whereas in the vicinity of islands the climate is stable. The magnetic fields within the Grand Line cause normal compasses to malfunction, making it even more difficult to navigate, and instead a special compass called a must be used. The Log Pose functions by locking on to one island's magnetic field and then locking on to another island's magnetic field. The time for it to set depends on the island. This process can be bypassed by obtaining an , a Log Pose variation that is permanently set to a specific island and never changes.\n\nThe world of \"One Piece\" includes anachronisms, such as the , snail-like animals that can be attached to electric equipment and function as rotary phones, fax machines, surveillance cameras, and similar devices. , the shells of certain sky-dwelling animals, can be used to store kinetic energy, wind, sound, images, heat, and the like and have various applications.\n\nA is a type of fruit that, when eaten, grants a power to the eater. A person may only eat one Devil Fruit during their lifetime, as eating a second devil fruit will swiftly end their life. There are three categories of Devil Fruits;\n\n\n\n\nDevil Fruits are said to be incarnations of the sea devil himself, and as a result, Devil Fruit users cannot swim in sea water, as \"they are hated by the sea\". Sea-prism stone also has this effect. When even partially submerged in sea water, they lose all their strength and coordination, although some abilities remain. For example, Luffy is still able to stretch after being totally submerged. Moving water, such as rain or waves, does not have this effect. When a Devil Fruit user dies, the powers reincarnate into a new Devil Fruit. For unknown reasons, Devil Fruit users cannot eat a second Devil Fruit because it would cause their bodies to burst, although Blackbeard managed to get a second Devil Fruit power through an unknown method. Devil Fruit powers can be in a stage called \"Awakened\", where the user can turn anything around them, besides their own bodies, into what their Devil Fruit power is.\n\n is a latent ability that every living being in the world of \"One Piece\" possesses; very few manage to awaken it, and even fewer master it. There are three varieties of Haki: allows one to sense the presence of other beings and to have a form of limited precognition. (This is a great advantage in combat because the user can foresee his opponent's attacks). allows one to envelop body parts and even inanimate forms with a force akin to an invisible armor that possesses defensive and offensive properties. It also allows one to inflict harm upon Devil Fruit users. The rare is an ability that, unlike the other two Haki, only a few gifted people have. (If a person is not gifted, then no matter how much they train they will never be able to use it). The Color of the Conquering King enables one to overpower the will of the weak-willed. It can be used to mind-control or even render the victim unconscious. Note that strong willed people can withstand, or even completely ignore, the effects of this Haki, even if they do not possess this ability themselves. This Haki can also have physical impacts, such as causing tremors and destruction to the user's surrounding area. It is shown that when it is used too much Haki will stop working for certain periods of time, so it can't be in use constantly.\n\nWhile working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki, Oda began writing \"One Piece\" in 1996. It started as two one-shot stories entitled \"Romance Dawn\"—which would later be used as the title for \"One Piece\"s first chapter and volume. They both featured the character of Luffy, and included elements that would appear later in the main series. The first of these short stories was published in August 1996 in \"Akamaru Jump\" and later in \"One Piece Red\". The second was published in the 41st issue of \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" in 1996, and reprinted in 1998 in Oda's short story collection, \"Wanted!\".\n\nOda revealed that he originally planned \"One Piece\" to last five years, and that he had already planned the ending. However, he found it would take longer than he had expected. Oda stated that the ending would be what he had decided in the beginning; he is committed to seeing it through.\n\nWhen creating a Devil Fruit, Oda thinks of something that would fulfill a human desire; he added that he does not see why he would draw a Devil Fruit unless the fruit's appearance would entice one to eat it. The names of many special attacks, as well as other concepts in the manga, consist of a form of punning in which phrases written in \"kanji\" are paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names of Luffy, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, and Franky's techniques are often mixed with other languages, and the names of several of Zoro's sword techniques are designed as jokes; some of them look fearsome when read by sight but sound like kinds of food when read aloud. For example, Zoro's signature move is \"Onigiri\", which is written as \"demon cut\" but is pronounced the same as \"rice ball\" in Japanese. Eisaku Inoue, the animation director, has said that the creators did not use these \"kanji\" readings in the anime since they \"might have cut down the laughs by about half\". Nevertheless, Konosuke Uda, the director, said that he believes that the creators \"made the anime pretty close to the manga\".\n\nOda was \"sensitive\" about how his work would be translated. In many instances, the English version of the \"One Piece\" manga uses one onomatopoeia for multiple onomatopoeia used in the Japanese version. For instance, \"\"saaa\" (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and \"zaaa\"\" (the sound of pouring rain) are both translated as \"fshhhhhhh\". Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything that moves himself to create a consistent look while leaving his staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn.\n\nWhen a reader asked Oda who Nami is in love with, he answered that there will not likely be any references to romance, since he believes the series' intended demographic is not interested.\n\nWritten and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda, \"One Piece\" has been serialized in the manga anthology \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" since July 22, 1997. The chapters have been collected into \"tankōbon\" volumes by Shueisha since December 24, 1997. In total, there are 914 chapters and 89 \"tankōbon\" volumes. Oda teamed up with Akira Toriyama to create a single crossover of \"One Piece\" and Toriyama's \"Dragon Ball\". Entitled \"Cross Epoch\", the one-shot was published in the December 25, 2006, issue of \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" and the April 2011 issue of the English \"Shonen Jump\". Oda collaborated with Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro, author of \"Toriko\", for a crossover one-shot of their series titled , which ran in the April 4, 2011, issue of \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\". The spinoff series , written by Ei Andō in a super deformed art style, began serialization in the January 2015 issue of \"Saikyō Jump\".\n\nThe \"One Piece\" manga was licensed for an English language release by Viz Media, who published it via chapters in the manga anthology \"Shonen Jump\", since the magazine's launch in November 2002, and in bound volumes since June 30, 2003. In 2009, Viz announced the release of five volumes per month during the first half of 2010 to catch up with the serialization in Japan. Following the discontinuation of the print \"Shonen Jump\", Viz began releasing \"One Piece\" chapterwise in its digital successor \"Weekly Shonen Jump\" on January 30, 2012. In the United Kingdom, the volumes were published by Gollancz Manga, starting in March 2006, until Viz Media took it over after the fourteenth volume. In Australia and New Zealand, the English volumes have been distributed by Madman Entertainment since November 10, 2008. \n\nIn Poland, Japonica Polonica Fantastica is publishing the manga, Glénat in France, Panini Comics in Mexico, LARP Editores and later by Ivrea in Argentina, Planeta de Libros in Spain, and Edizioni Star Comics in Italy.\n\n\"One Piece: Defeat Him! The Pirate Ganzack!\" was produced by Production I.G for the 1998 Jump Super Anime Tour and was directed by Gorō Taniguchi. Luffy, Nami, and Zoro are attacked by a sea monster that destroys their boat and separates them. Luffy is found on an island beach, where he saves a little girl, Medaka, from two pirates. All the villagers, including Medaka's father have been abducted by Ganzack and his crew and forced into labor. After hearing that Ganzack also stole all the food, Luffy and Zoro rush out to retrieve it. As they fight the pirates, one of them kidnaps Medaka. A fight starts between Luffy and Ganzack, ending with Luffy's capture. Meanwhile, Zoro is forced to give up after a threat is made to kill all the villagers. They rise up against Ganzack, and while the islanders and pirates fight, Nami unlocks the three captives. Ganzack defeats the rebellion and reveals his armored battleship. The Straw Hat Pirates are forced to fight Ganzack once more to prevent him from destroying the island.\n\nA second film, \"One Piece: Romance Dawn Story\", was produced by Toei Animation in July 2008 for the Jump Super Anime Tour. It is 34 minutes in length and based on the first version of \"Romance Dawn\". It includes the Straw Hat Pirates up to Brook and their second ship, the \"Thousand Sunny\". In search for food for his crew, Luffy arrives at a port after defeating a pirate named Crescent Moon Gally on the way. There he meets a girl named Silk, who was abandoned by attacking pirates as a baby and raised by the mayor. Her upbringing causes her to value the town as her \"treasure\". The villagers mistake Luffy for Gally and capture him just as the real Gally returns. Gally throws Luffy in the water and plans to destroy the town, but Silk saves him and Luffy pursues Gally. His crew arrives to help him, and with their help he recovers the treasure for the town, acquires food, and destroys Gally's ship.\n\nThe film was later released as a triple feature DVD with \"\" and \"Tegami Bachi: Light and Blue Night\", that was available only though a mail-in offer exclusively to Japanese residents.\n\nThe \"One Piece Film Strong World: Episode 0\" original video animation adapts the manga's special \"Chapter 0\", which shows how things were before and after the death of Roger. It received a limited release of three thousand DVDs as a collaboration with the House Foods brand.\n\nToei Animation produces an anime television series based on the \"One Piece\" manga. The series, which premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on October 20, 1999, has aired more than 800 episodes, and has been exported to various countries around the world. Two cross-over episodes with the anime adaptation of \"Toriko\" were aired. The first of these, which was also the first episode of \"Toriko\", aired on April 3, 2011. A second special, which also crossed over with \"Dragon Ball Z\", aired on April 7, 2013.\n\nOn June 8, 2004, 4Kids Entertainment acquired the license for distribution of \"One Piece\" in North America. 4Kids contracted Viz Media to handle home video distribution. 4Kids' in-house musicians wrote a new background score and theme song nicknamed \"Pirate Rap\". 4Kids' dub mandated edits for content and length, which reduced the first 143 episodes into 104. Initially, 4Kids originally created an English version of the first opening theme, \"We Are!\" It premiered in the United States on September 18, 2004, in first-run syndication on the Fox network as part of the weekend programming block Fox Box, and later aired on Cartoon Network on their weekday afternoon programming block Toonami in April 2005. Production was halted in 2006 after episode 143/104. Viz also ceased its home video release of the series after volume 11. On July 22, 2010, an interview with Anime News Network and Mark Kirk, senior vice-president of digital media for 4Kids Entertainment, revealed that 4Kids acquired \"One Piece\" as part of a package deal with other anime, and that the company did not screen the series before licensing it. However, once 4Kids realized \"One Piece\" was not appropriate for their intended demographic, the company decided to edit it into a more child-oriented series until they had an opportunity to legally drop the license. Kirk said the experience of producing \"One Piece\" \"ruined the company's reputation\". Since then, 4Kids established a stricter set of guidelines, checks, and balances to determine which anime the company acquires.\n\nOn April 13, 2007, Funimation licensed the series and started production on an English-language release of \"One Piece\". In an interview with voice actor Christopher Sabat, he stated that Funimation had been interested in acquiring \"One Piece\" from the very beginning, and produced a \"test episode,\" in which Sabat portrayed the character of Helmeppo and Eric Vale played the part of the main character, Monkey D. Luffy. (They would later go on to provide the English voices for Roronoa Zoro and Sanji, respectively.) After resuming production of the renewed English dub, which featured less censorship because of fewer restrictions on cable programming, Funimation released its first uncut, bilingual DVD box set containing 13 episodes on May 27, 2008. Similarly sized sets followed with fourteen sets released. The Funimation-dubbed episodes premiered on Cartoon Network on September 29, 2007 and aired until its removal on March 22, 2008. On October 28, 2011, Funimation posted a press release on their official website confirming the acquisition of episodes 206–263, and the aspect ratio, beginning with episode 207, would be changed to the 16:9 widescreen format. On May 18, 2013, the uncut series began airing on Adult Swim's revived Toonami late-night programming block from episode 207 onward. \"One Piece\" was removed from the Toonami block after March 18, 2017.\n\nIn May 2009, Funimation, Toei Animation, Shueisha, and Fuji Television announced they would simulcast stream the series within an hour of the weekly Japanese broadcast at no charge. Originally scheduled to begin on May 30, 2009, with episode 403, a lack of security resulted in a leak of the episode, and Funimation delayed the offer until episode 415 on August 29, 2009. \n\nOn February 12, 2013, it was announced that Manga Entertainment would start releasing the Funimation dub of \"One Piece\" in the United Kingdom in a DVD box set format. Crunchyroll began simulcasting the series on November 2, 2013, for the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Latin America.\n\nThirteen animated theatrical films based on the \"One Piece\" series have been released in Japan. The films are typically released in March in accordance with the spring vacation of Japanese schools. The films feature self-contained, completely original plots, or alternate retellings of story arcs with animation of a higher quality than what the weekly anime allows. The first three films were typically double features paired up with other anime films, and were thus, usually an hour or less in length. The films themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity. Funimation has licensed the eighth, tenth, and twelfth films for release in North America, and these films have received in-house dubs by the company.\n\nThe \"One Piece\" franchise has been adapted into multiple video games published by subsidiaries of Bandai and later as part of Bandai Namco Entertainment. The games have been released on a variety of video game, handheld consoles, and mobile devices. The video games feature role-playing games, and fighting games, such as the titles of the \"Grand Battle!\" meta-series. The series debuted in Japan on July 19, 2000, with \"\". Over forty games have been produced based on the franchise. Additionally, \"One Piece\" characters and settings have appeared in various \"Shonen Jump\" crossover games, such as \"Battle Stadium D.O.N\", \"Jump Super Stars\", \"Jump Ultimate Stars,\" and \"J-Stars Victory VS\".\n\nMusic soundtracks have been released that are based on songs that premiered in the series. Kohei Tanaka and Shiro Hamaguchi composed the score for \"One Piece\". Various theme songs and character songs were released on a total of 49 singles. Eight compilation albums and seventeen soundtrack CDs have been released featuring songs and themes that were introduced in the series.\n\nA series of light novels was published based on the first festival film, certain episodes of the anime television series, and all but the first feature film. They feature artwork by Oda and are written by Tatsuya Hamasaki. The first of these novels, \"One Piece: Defeat The Pirate Ganzak!\" was released on June 3, 1999. \"One Piece: Logue Town Chapter\" followed on July 17, 2000, as an adaptation of the anime television series' Logue Town story arc.

On December 25, 2001, saw the publication of the second, and so far last, light novel adaptation of an anime television series arc in \"One Piece: Thousand-year Dragon Legend\". The adaptation of \"Chopper's Kingdom on the Island of Strange Animals\" was released on March 22, 2002, and that of \"Dead End Adventure\" on March 10, 2003. \"Curse of the Sacred Sword\" followed on March 22, 2004, and \"Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island\" on March 14, 2005. The light novel of \"The Giant Mechanical Soldier of Karakuri Castle\" was released on March 6, 2006, and that of \"\" on March 7, 2007. The newest novel adapts \"\" and was released on February 25, 2008.\n\nFive art books and five guidebooks for the \"One Piece\" series have been released. The first art book, \"One Piece: Color Walk 1\", released June 2001, was also released in English by Viz Media on November 8, 2005.

The third guidebook, \"One Piece: Yellow – Grand Elements\", was released on April 4, 2007, and the fourth, \"One Piece: Green – Secret Pieces\", followed on November 4, 2010. An anime guidebook, \"One Piece: Rainbow!\", was released on May 1, 2007, and covers the first eight years of the TV anime.\n\nThe Baratie restaurant, modeled after the restaurant of the same name in the manga, opened in June 2013 at the Fuji Television headquarters. An indoor theme park located inside the Tokyo Tower called the Tokyo One Piece Tower, which includes the Mugiwara Cafe, opened on March 13, 2015.\n\nOther \"One Piece\" media include a trading card game by Bandai called \"One Piece CCG\" and a drama CD centering on the character of Nefertari Vivi released by Avex Trax on December 26, 2002. A Hello Kitty-inspired Chopper was used for several pieces of merchandise as a collaboration between \"One Piece\" and Hello Kitty. A kabuki play inspired by \"One Piece\" ran at Tokyo's Shinbashi Enbujō throughout October and November 2015.\n\n\"One Piece\" is the first-ever manga series to hold a \"Dome Tour\", in which events were held from March 25 to 27 at the Kyocera Dome in Osaka, and from April 27 to May 1 at the Tokyo Dome. In 2014, the first One Piece exhibition in Korea was held at the War Memorial of Korea, and the second exhibition in Hongik Daehango Art Center. In 2015, a \"One Piece\" \"trompe-l'œil\" exhibition was held at the Hong Kong 3D Museum.\n\nOn July 21, 2017, \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" editor-in-chief Hiroyuki Nakano announced that Tomorrow Studios (a partnership between Marty Adelstein and ITV Studios) and Shueisha would commence production of an American live-action television adaptation of Eiichiro Oda's \"One Piece\" manga series as part of the series' 20th anniversary celebrations. Eiichiro Oda will serve as executive producer for the series alongside Tomorrow Studios CEO Adelstein and Becky Clements. The series will reportedly begin with the East Blue arc.\n\n\"One Piece\" is the best-selling manga series in history; it sold 100 million collected \"tankōbon\" volumes by February 2005, and over 200 million by February 2011, before selling over 365 million copies sold in Japan and 440 million copies worldwide as of May 2018. According to Oricon, \"One Piece\" has been the best-selling manga series every year since 2008 when the company began its manga chart, and it became the best-selling manga for the tenth consecutive year in 2017. Due to promotions for the \"Strong World\" film, all 56 volumes of the manga released at the time charted on Oricon's list of the top 200 manga for the week of December 7–13, 2009. Up until February 2012, \"One Piece\" had grossed at least ($1,404,220,000) in manga \"tankōbon\" sales revenue.\n\nAdditionally, individual volumes of \"One Piece\" have broken publishing and sales records in Japan. In 2009, Volume 56 had the highest initial print run of any manga: 2.85 million copies. Volume 57's print run of 3 million copies in 2010 was the highest first print for any book of any subject in Japan—a record that was broken several times by subsequent volumes and currently held by Volume 67's 4.05 million initial printing in 2012. Volume 60 was the first book to sell over two million copies in its opening week on Oricon book rankings, and later became the first book to sell over three million copies since the chart began in 2008.\n\n\"One Piece\" has also sold well in North America, charting on \"Publishers Weekly\"s list of bestselling comics for April/May 2007 and numerous times on \"The New York Times\" Manga Best Seller list. On \"ICv2\"s list of Top 25 Manga Properties Fall 2008 for North America, which is compiled by interviews with retailers and distributors, Nielsen BookScan's Top 20 Lists of graphic novels and \"ICv2\"s own analysis of information provided by Diamond Comic Distributors, \"One Piece\" came in 15th place. It rose to second place on their Top 25 Manga Properties Q3 2010 list.\nAllen Divers of Anime News Network comments in 2003 that the art style \"One Piece\" employs \"initially seems very cartoonish with much of the character designs showing more North American influence than that from its Japanese origins\". Adding that the \"artwork and settings come across as timeless in their presentation\". He also notes that the influence of Akira Toriyama (\"Dragon Ball\") shines through in Oda's style of writing with its \"huge epic battles punctuated by a lot of humor\" and that, in \"One Piece\", he \"manages to share a rich tale without getting bogged down by overly complicated plots\". Rebecca Silverman of the same site stated that one of the series' strengths is to \"blend action, humor, and heavy fare together\" and praised the art, but stated that the panels could get too crowded for easy reading. The website \"activeAnime\" describes the artwork in \"One Piece\" as \"wonderfully quirky and full of expression\". \"Splashcomics\" comments that Oda's \"pleasantly bright and dynamic\" () art style suits the story's \"funny and exciting\" (German: \"witzigen und ... spannenden\") atmosphere.\n\nEX Media lauds Oda's art for its \"crispy\" monochrome pictures, \"great use of subtle shade changes\" on color pages, \"sometimes exquisite\" use of angles, and for its consistency. Shaenon K. Garrity, who at some point edited the series for English \"Shonen Jump\", said that, while doing so, her amazement over Oda's craft grew steadily. She states that \"he has a natural, playful mastery of the often restrictive weekly-manga format,\" notes that \"interesting things [are] going on deep in the narrative structure,\" and recommends \"sticking through to the later volumes to see just how crazy and Peter Max-y the art gets\". Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine comments that \"One Piece is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast that is continuing to develop, with great action and character drama.\" He praised Oda's artwork as \"imaginative and creative\" and comments that \"Oda's imagination just oozes all of the panels \". He also notes that \"Oda's panel work [...] features a lot of interesting perspectives and direction, especially during the explosive action sequences which are always a blast,\" though he complains that the panels can sometimes get \"a little chaotic\".\n\nThe anime adaptations have also been very well-received. The first episode of the anime adaptation earned a viewer ratings percentage of 12.4, behind \"Pokémon\" and ahead of \"Ojamajo Doremi\". As of 2017, \"One Piece\" is among the top 10 anime in viewer ratings every week in Japan. On several occasions the \"One Piece\" anime has topped Japan's DVD sales.\n\nIn a review of the second DVD release of 4Kids Entertainment's dub, Todd Douglass, Jr. of DVD Talk called its adaptation a \"shabby treatment\" resulting in an \"arguably less enjoyable rendition\". Douglass said that the 4Kids original opening was \"a crappy rap song\" and that the removal of whole scenes leaves a \"feeling that something is missing\". He later went on to say that \"Fans of the 'real' \"One Piece\" will want to skip picking [...] up [4Kids Entertainment's \"One Piece\" DVDs] until an uncut release is announced\", and also stated that \"kids may get into this version because it's what they have seen on TV\". Margaret Veira of activeAnime praised the TV series' \"great\" animation, stating that \"It gives life and stays true to the style and characters of the manga.\" She notes the fight scenes in particular have \"a lot of energy to them\". Patrick King of Animefringe comments that the art style of \"One Piece\" is \"very distinctive and fresh\".\n\nIn a review of the first Funimation DVD release for Mania Entertainment, Bryce Coulter comments that \"One Piece\" is \"not your typical pirate adventure\" and that mixed with \"the right amount of random fun along with a shonen style storyline\" it becomes \"an appealing and fun romp\". In a review of Funimation's second DVD release for Mania Entertainment, Bryce Coulter comments that \"You can tell that they are giving One Piece the attention that was neglected by 4Kids\" and that \"One Piece is a great tale of high-seas fun that will leave you wanting more!\"\n\nIn Indonesia, Global TV was reprimanded by the Indonesian Broadcasting Commission (KPI) for airing the anime television series. Nina Armando, member of the KPI and a lecturer at the University of Indonesia, said the show should not be aired at times when children are likely to watch.\n\nThe \"One Piece\" manga was a finalist for the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize three times in a row from 2000 to 2002, with the highest number of fan nominations in the first two years. The German translation of its 44th volume won the Sondermann audience award in the international manga category, a yearly comic award given in seven categories by the Frankfurt Book Fair, the \"Frankfurter Rundschau\", \"Spiegel Online\" and Comicforum, at the Fair's Comics Centre in 2005. In a 2008 poll by Oricon, Japanese teenagers voted it the most interesting manga. The manga was nominated for Favorite Manga Series in \"Nickelodeon Magazine\"s 2009 Comics Awards. In 2012, \"One Piece\" won the 41st Japan Cartoonists Association Award Grand Prize, alongside Kimuchi Yokoyama's \"Nekodarake Nice\". \"Da Vinci\" magazine named \"One Piece\" number three on their list of 2013's top manga, which was voted on 4,619 professional book reviewers, bookstore employees, and \"Da Vinci\" readers. On June 15, 2015, it was announced that Eiichiro Oda and \"One Piece\" had set the Guinness World Record for \"The most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\" with 320,866,000 copies printed worldwide as of December 2014.\n\nThe first opening of the \"One Piece\" anime television series, \"We Are!\", won the Animation Kobe Theme Song Award of the year 2000. In February 2001, \"One Piece\" placed 9th among anime television series in Japan. In 2001, the readers of \"Animage\", a popular Japanese anime magazine, voted the anime television series in 5th place of The Readers' Picks for the Anime that should be remembered in the 21st Century. In June 2002, \"Animage\" readers voted \"One Piece\" to be the 16th best new anime of the year 2001, and gave it another 16th place in 2004 in the category Favorite Anime Series. In a 2005 web poll by Japanese television network TV Asahi \"One Piece\" was voted 6th most popular animated TV series. Before the poll, Asahi TV broadcast another list based on a nationwide survey in which \"One Piece\" placed 4th among teenagers. In 2006, it was elected 32nd of the Top 100 Japanese anime by TV Asahi and 21st by its viewers. Funimation's first DVD release of the series \"One Piece: Season 1 First Voyage\" was nominated for the Fifth Annual TV DVD Awards.\n\n\n"}

They are often affixed to women's dresses to support its weight or as part of its style. The term is also applied to carrying bags.\n\nDress shoulder straps are a length of fabric, usually in pairs, used to support clothing, especially women's clothing, such as a dress, camisole, apron or brassiere. Shoulder straps such as these are usually made of the same material as the garment, and may be quite flimsy, as they are normally not expected to support much weight.\n\nThe shoulder straps on some dresses may be very thin, in which case they may be called a spaghetti strap (also called \"noodle strap\"). These are common in clothing such as camisoles, cocktail dresses, and evening gowns.\n\nSome institutions ban spaghetti strap dresses and bare-shoulder strapless dresses on grounds of modesty.\n\nMany military uniform shirts, jackets, tunics, or greatcoats feature shoulder straps. They were originally designed to keep back packs, ammunition pouches or bayonets from slipping off the shoulder. They often display badges of rank, shoulder marks, regimental insignia or epaulettes.\n\nA carrier shoulder strap is a length of fabric or other flexible material (such as leather, vinyl, rubber), used to suspend an item, often of some weight, from the shoulder(s). The strap may be worn slung over one shoulder or across the body. In the interest of comfort, they often have some manner of padding near the middle, where the strap rests directly against the shoulder or neck. Such items include purses, guitars, rifles, etc. In the case of rifles and other such weaponry, the shoulder strap is usually referred to as a \"sling\". Shoulder straps may also be used in pairs on such items as a backpack or a baby carrier; the straps are worn one over each shoulder, and the item so carried is centred on the back or chest. Some camera strap manufacturers, such as BlackRapid, design their straps to fit over both shoulders allowing two cameras to rest at hip level.\n\nThe use of such straps frees the hands for other use.\n\n"}
{"id": "1343167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1343167", "title": "Silent trade", "text": "Silent trade\n\nSilent trade, also called silent barter, dumb barter (\"dumb\" here used in its old meaning of \"mute\"), or depot trade, is a method by which traders who cannot speak each other's language can trade without talking. \"Group A\" would leave trade goods in a prominent position and signal, by gong, fire, or drum for example, that they had left goods. \"Group B\" would then arrive at the spot, examine the goods and deposit their trade goods or money that they wanted to exchange and withdraw. \"Group A\" would then return and either accept the trade by taking the goods from \"Group B\" or withdraw again leaving \"Group B\" to add to or change out items to create an equal value. The trade ends when \"Group A\" accepts \"Group B's\" offer and removes the offered goods leaving \"Group B\" to remove the original goods.\n\nThis system was used in many parts of ancient Africa. Silent trading was mainly used during the period 500 to 1500. The practice was also well established between tribes in Africa in their trade with India. Cosmas Indicopleustes describes this practiced in Azania, where officials from Axum traded for gold with beef. Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal recorded this practice when he occupied Ceuta in 1415.\n\nIn West Africa gold mined south of the Sahel was traded for salt mined in the desert. The salt from the desert was needed by the people of Sahel to flavor and preserve their food and the gold had obvious value, especially in trading with the European people. Because of this trade, cities grew and flourished and parts of West Africa became commercial centers. West Africa produced large amounts of gold until about 1500 AD. The communication in this gold-for-salt was carried out using drums.\n\nSilent trade might be used because of an inability to speak the other traders' language, or to protect the secrets of where the valuable gold and salt came from.\n\nSilent bartering has been used since ancient times, such as the ancient Ghana Empire. The Ghanaian salt traders would leave pounds of salt by the Niger river and the gold traders would leave a fair amount of gold in turn.\n\nTo perform a silent trade, one group of traders would go to a specific location, leave their trading goods and then withdraw to a distance. Then play a drum to signal the other traders that a silent trade was taking place. The other group of traders would then approach and inspect the goods (most commonly salt or gold). If the goods met with approval, the second group would then take the goods, leave their own goods in return, and depart. This system of trading was used in particular in ancient Ghana. It was also used among the Kushites and the Aksumites.\n\nThe Greek historian Herodotus wrote about the gold trade with Ghana and Carthage: \"The Carthaginians also tell us that they trade with a race of men who live in a part of Libya beyond the Pillars of Hercules. On reaching this country, they unload their goods, arrange them tidily along the beach, and then, returning to their boats, raise a smoke. Seeing the smoke, the natives come down to the beach, place on the ground a certain quantity of gold in exchange for the goods, and go off again to a distance. The Carthaginians then come ashore and take a look at the gold; and if they think it represents a fair price for their wares, they collect it and go away; if, on the other hand, it seems too little, they go back aboard and wait, and the natives come and add to the gold until they are satisfied. There is perfect honesty on both sides; the Carthaginians never touch the gold until it equals in value what they have offered for sale, and the natives never touch the goods until the gold has been taken away.\"\n\nW.S.W. Ruschenberger, M.D., in Zanzibar in 1835, describes Banyan merchants, then cites \"Establecimientos ultramarinos. Tomo III. Madrid 1786\" in writing:\n...A very short time sufficed them to transact the most important business. They usually dealt in bazaars; the vender told the price of his goods in a subdued voice and in few words; the purchaser replied by taking his hand, and by a certain manner of doubling and extending the fingers, explained what abatement he wished in the price. The bargain was often concluded without speaking a word; and, to ratify it, the hand was again taken in token of its inviolability...Such were the Banyans three centuries gone by, and we have reason to think, they have not been entirely changed.\n\n"}
{"id": "38543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38543", "title": "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas", "text": "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\n\n\"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\" is a 1973 work of short philosophical fiction by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin. With deliberately both vague and vivid descriptions, the narrator depicts a summer festival in the utopian city of Omelas, whose prosperity depends on the perpetual misery of a single child.\n\n\"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\" was nominated for the Locus Award for Best Short Fiction in 1974 and won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1974.\n\nLe Guin's piece was originally published in \"New Dimensions 3\", a hard-cover science fiction anthology edited by Robert Silverberg, in October 1973. It was reprinted in Le Guin's \"The Wind's Twelve Quarters\" in 1975, and has been frequently anthologized elsewhere.\n\nIt has also appeared as an independently published, 31-page hardcover book for young adults in 1993.\n\nIt was republished in the second volume of the short-story anthology \"The Unreal and the Real\" in 2014.\n\nThe only chronological element of the work is that it begins by describing the first day of summer in Omelas, a shimmering city of unbelievable happiness and delight. In Omelas, the summer solstice is celebrated with a glorious festival and a race featuring young people on horseback. The vibrant festival atmosphere, however, seems to be an everyday characteristic of the blissful community, whose citizens, though limited in their advanced technology to communal (rather than private) resources, are still intelligent, sophisticated, and cultured. Omelas has no kings, soldiers, priests, or slaves. The specific socio-politico-economic setup of the community is not mentioned, but the narrator merely explains that the reader cannot be sure of every particular.\n\nSelf-admittedly, the uncertain narrator reflects that \"Omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale, long ago and far away, once upon a time. Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids, assuming it will rise to the occasion, for certainly I cannot suit you all.\" \n\nEverything about Omelas is so abundantly pleasing that the narrator decides the reader is not yet truly convinced of its existence and so elaborates upon one final element of the city: its one atrocity. The city's constant state of serenity and splendor requires that a single unfortunate child be kept in perpetual filth, darkness, and misery.\n\nOnce citizens are old enough to know the truth, most, though initially shocked and disgusted, ultimately acquiesce to this one injustice that secures the happiness of the rest of the city. However, a few citizens, young and old, silently walk away from the city, and no one knows where they go. The writing ends with \"The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible it does not exist. But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas.\"\n\nLe Guin stated that the city's name is pronounced \"OH-meh-lahss\". Le Guin hit upon the name of the town on seeing a road sign for Salem, Oregon, in a car mirror. \"[… People ask me] 'Where \"do\" you get your ideas from, Ms. Le Guin?' From forgetting Dostoyevsky and reading road signs backwards, naturally. Where else?\"\n\n\"The central idea of this psychomyth, the scapegoat\", writes Le Guin, \"turns up in Dostoyevsky's \"Brothers Karamazov\", and several people have asked me, rather suspiciously, why I gave the credit to William James. The fact is, I haven't been able to re-read Dostoyevsky, much as I loved him, since I was twenty-five, and I'd simply forgotten he used the idea. But when I met it in James' 'The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life,' it was with a shock of recognition.\"\n\nThe quote from William James is:\n\nIntroducing the short work in her 2012 collection \"The Unreal and the Real, Volume Two\", Le Guin noted that \"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\" \"has a long and happy career of being used by teachers to upset students and make them argue fiercely about morality.\"\n\nIt has been at times analyzed as a postmodernist work.\n\n"}

Vogler revised the book for a second release in 1998 and changed the title to \"The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers\". The third edition, published in 2007, included a new introduction, new artwork and analysis of recent, popular motion pictures.\n\nThe title of the book was influenced by a number of sources. The first came from Campbell's text, \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\". Later, in the 1980s, two documentaries would introduce the phrase, \"The Hero's Journey\" into popular discourse. The first, released in 1987, \"The Hero's Journey: The World of Joseph Campbell\" was accompanied by a 1990 companion book, \"The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work\".

{"id": "13039867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13039867", "title": "Twilight (novel series)", "text": "Twilight (novel series)\n\nTwilight is a series of four vampire-themed fantasy romance novels by American author Stephenie Meyer. Released annually from 2005 through 2008, the four books chart the later teen years of Isabella \"Bella\" Swan, a girl who moves to Forks, Washington, and falls in love with a 104-year-old vampire named Edward Cullen. The series is told primarily from Bella's point of view, with the epilogue of \"Eclipse\" and Part II of \"Breaking Dawn\" being told from the viewpoint of character Jacob Black, a werewolf. The unpublished \"Midnight Sun\" is a retelling of the first book, \"Twilight\", from Edward Cullen's point of view. The novella \"The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner\", which tells the story of a newborn vampire who appeared in \"Eclipse\", was published on June 5, 2010, as a hardcover book and on June 7 as a free online ebook. \"\", a definitive encyclopedic reference with nearly 100 full color illustrations, was released in bookstores on April 12, 2011.\n\nSince the release of the first novel, \"Twilight\", in 2005, the books have gained immense popularity and commercial success around the world. The series is most popular among young adults; the four books have won multiple awards, most notably the 2008 British Book Award for \"Children's Book of the Year\" for \"Breaking Dawn\", while the series as a whole won the 2009 Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Book.\n\nIn November 2011, the series had sold over 120 million copies worldwide with translations into at least 38 different languages around the globe. The four \"Twilight\" books have consecutively set records as the biggest selling novels of 2008 on the \"USA Today\" Best-Selling Books list and have spent over 235 weeks on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list for Children's Series Books.\n\nThe books have been adapted into \"The Twilight Saga\" series of motion pictures by Summit Entertainment. The film adaptations of the first three books were released in 2008, 2009, and 2010 respectively. The fourth book is adapted into two full-length films—the first film being released in November 2011, and the second film in November 2012.\n\nBella Swan moves from Phoenix, Arizona to live with her father in Forks, Washington to allow her mother to travel with her new husband, a minor league baseball player. After moving to Forks, Bella finds herself involuntarily drawn to a mysterious, handsome boy, Edward Cullen and eventually learns that he is a member of a vampire family which drinks animal blood rather than human blood. Edward and Bella fall in love, while James, a sadistic vampire from another coven, is drawn to hunt down Bella. Edward and the other Cullens defend Bella. She escapes to Phoenix, where she is tricked into confronting James, who tries to kill her. She is seriously wounded, but Edward rescues her and they return to Forks.\n\nEdward and his family leave Forks because he believes he is endangering Bella's life. Bella goes into a depression until she develops a strong friendship with Jacob Black, who she discovers can shape-shift into a wolf. Jacob and the other wolves in his tribe must protect her from Victoria, a vampire seeking to avenge the death of her mate James. Due to a misunderstanding, Edward believes Bella is dead. Edward decides to commit suicide in Volterra, Italy, but is stopped by Bella, who is accompanied by Edward's sister, Alice. They meet with the Volturi, a powerful vampire coven, and are released only on the condition that Bella be turned into a vampire in the near future. Bella and Edward are reunited, and she and the Cullens return to Forks.\n\nVictoria has created an army of \"newborn\" vampires to battle the Cullen family and murder Bella for revenge. Meanwhile, Bella is compelled to choose between her relationship with Edward and her friendship with Jacob. Edward's vampire family and Jacob's werewolf pack join forces to successfully destroy Victoria and her vampire army. In the end, Bella chooses Edward's love over Jacob's friendship and agrees to marry Edward.\n\nBella and Edward are married, but their honeymoon is cut short when Bella discovers that she is pregnant. Her pregnancy progresses rapidly, severely weakening her. She nearly dies giving birth to her and Edward's half-vampire-half-human daughter, Renesmee. Edward injects Bella with his venom to save her life and turns her into a vampire. A vampire from another coven sees Renesmee and mistakes her for an \"immortal child\". She informs the Volturi, as the existence of such beings violates vampire law. The Cullens gather vampire witnesses who can verify that Renesmee is not an immortal child. After an intense confrontation, the Cullens and their witnesses convince the Volturi that the child poses no danger to vampires or their secret, and they are left in peace by the Volturi.\n\n\nThe story is set primarily in the town of Forks, Washington, where Bella and her father, Charlie Swan, live. Other cities in Washington briefly appear in the series or are mentioned, such as Port Angeles, Olympia, Seattle and La Push. Some events in \"Twilight\" take place in Phoenix, Arizona, where Bella was raised. Volterra, Italy, is featured in \"New Moon\", when Edward travels there to commit suicide and Bella rushes to save him. Jacksonville, Florida, is mentioned first in \"Twilight\" and second in \"Eclipse\", when Edward and Bella visit Bella's mother, who has moved there with her new husband. Seattle, Washington, is featured in \"Breaking Dawn\" when Jacob tries to escape his love for Bella, and when Bella tries to locate a man named J. Jenks. It is also the location of a series of murders committed by newborn vampires in \"Eclipse\". In \"Breaking Dawn\", Bella and Edward spend their honeymoon on a fictional \"Isle Esme\", purportedly off the coast of Brazil.\n\nThe \"Twilight\" series falls under the genre of young adult, fantasy, and romance, though Meyer categorized her first book, \"Twilight\", as \"suspense romance horror comedy\". However, she states that she considers her books as \"romance more than anything else\". The series explores the unorthodox romance between human Bella and vampire Edward, as well as the love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob, a werewolf. The books avoid delving into provocative sex, drugs, and harsh swearing because, according to Meyer, \"I don't think teens need to read about gratuitous sex.\"\n\nThe books are written in first-person narrative, primarily through Bella's eyes with the epilogue of the third book and a part of the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I have a hard time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like. And it's so \"not\" like the other vampire books out there–Anne Rice's and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.\n\nThe books are based on the vampire myth, but \"Twilight\" vampires differ in a number of particulars from the general vampire lore. For instance, \"Twilight\" vampires have strong piercing teeth rather than fangs; they glitter in sunlight rather than burn; and they can drink animal as well as human blood. Meyer comments that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she wasn't informed about the canon vampires, saying, It wasn't until I knew that \"Twilight\" would be published that I began to think about whether my vampires were too much the same or too much different from the others. Of course, I was far too invested in my characters at that point to be making changes... so I didn't cut out fangs and coffins and so forth as a way to distinguish my vampires; that's just how they came to me.\n\nAccording to the author, her books are \"about life, not death\" and \"love, not lust\". Each book in the series was inspired by and loosely based on a different literary classic: \"Twilight\" on Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"New Moon\" on Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Eclipse\" on Emily Brontë's \"Wuthering Heights\", and \"Breaking Dawn\" on a second Shakespeare play, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Meyer also states that Orson Scott Card and L. M. Montgomery's \"Anne of Green Gables\" series are a big influence on her writing. The Cullens were inspired by Meyer's own family as well as characters from the \"X-Men\" cartoon. Other influences on the series which Meyer has acknowledged include \"Jane Eyre\" by Charlotte Brontë, HGTV, and the films \"Iron Man\", \"Somewhere in Time\", \"Stranger than Fiction\", and \"Baby Mama\".\n\nOther major themes of the series include choice and free will. Meyer says that the books are centered around Bella's choice to choose her life on her own, and the Cullens' choices to abstain from killing rather than follow their temptations: \"I really think that's the underlying metaphor of my vampires. It doesn't matter where you're stuck in life or what you think you have to do; you can always choose something else. There's always a different path.\"\n\nMeyer, a Mormon, acknowledges that her faith has influenced her work. In particular, she says that her characters \"tend to think more about where they came from, and where they are going, than might be typical.\" Meyer also steers her work from subjects such as sex, despite the romantic nature of the novels. Meyer says that she does not consciously intend her novels to be Mormon-influenced, or to promote the virtues of sexual abstinence and spiritual purity, but admits that her writing is shaped by her values, saying, \"I don't think my books are going to be really graphic or dark, because of who I am. There's always going to be a lot of light in my stories.\"\n\nStephenie Meyer says that the idea for \"Twilight\" came to her in a dream on June 2, 2003. The dream was about a human girl, and a vampire who was in love with her but thirsted for her blood. Based on this dream, Meyer wrote the transcript of what is now chapter 13 of the book. Despite having very little writing experience, in a matter of three months she had transformed that dream into a completed novel. After writing and editing the novel, she signed a three-book deal with Little, Brown and Company for $750,000, an unusually high amount for a first time author. Meyer's literary agent, Jodi Reamer of Writers House, discovered her only because the inexperienced assistant who received Meyer's original letter did not know that young adult books are supposed to be 40,000 to 60,000 words in length, not 130,000 words. Megan Tingley, the Little, Brown editor who signed Meyer, said that halfway through the reading of the \"Twilight\" manuscript, she realized that she had a future bestseller in her hands. The book was released in 2005.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Twilight\", Meyer expanded the story into a series with three more books: \"New Moon\" (2006), \"Eclipse\" (2007), and \"Breaking Dawn\" (2008). In its first week after publication, the first sequel, \"New Moon\", debuted at #5 on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller List for Children's Chapter Books, and in its second week rose to the #1 position, where it remained for the next eleven weeks. In total, it spent over 50 weeks on the list. After the release of \"Eclipse\", the first three \"Twilight\" books spent a combined 143 weeks on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller List. The fourth installment of the \"Twilight\" series, \"Breaking Dawn\", was released with an initial print run of 3.7 million copies. Over 1.3 million copies were sold on the first day alone, setting a record in first-day sales performance for the Hachette Book Group USA. Upon the completion of the fourth entry in the series, Meyer indicated that \"Breaking Dawn\" would be the final novel to be told from Bella Swan's perspective. In 2008 and 2009, the four books of the series claimed the top four spots on \"USA Today\"'s year-end bestseller list, making Meyer the first author to ever achieve this feat. The series then won the 2009 Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Book, where it competed against the \"Harry Potter\" series.\n\nMeyer originally planned to write a companion book to \"Twilight\" called \"Midnight Sun\", which would be the story of \"Twilight\" told from Edward Cullen's point-of-view. She stated that \"Twilight\" was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective. However, a rough draft of \"Midnight Sun's\" first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since put these twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free, but has put the project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, If I tried to write \"Midnight Sun\" now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on \"Midnight Sun\", and so it is on hold indefinitely. Though she has no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if she were to continue writing in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.\n\nOn March 16, 2010 Yen Press released \"Twilight: The Graphic Novel, Vol. 1\", by artist Young Kim based on the first book in the series. In February 2011, the graphic novel won the 2010 Gem Awards Best Manga of the Year. The sequel, \"Twilight: The Graphic Novel, Vol. 2\" was released on October 11, 2011 and followed \"Volume 1\" in topping \"The New York Times Best Seller list\" for Hardcover Graphic Books in its first week. On March 30, 2010, Meyer revealed on her official website that she will be releasing a new novella in the series, \"The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner\", which tells the story of a newborn vampire who appeared in \"Eclipse\", on June 5, 2010. An electronic version of the book was made available free from her web site, as well as in bookstores.\n\nOn October 5, 2010, Little, Brown and Company announced that \"\", a definitive encyclopedic reference for the saga including character profiles, outtakes, a conversation with Meyer, genealogical charts, maps and extensive cross-references with nearly 100 full color illustrations, was to be released on April 12, 2011, after many publication delays since 2008. It debuted at #1 on \"The New York Times Best Seller list\", where it stayed for three consecutive weeks, and at #4 on the USA Today Best Seller list.\n\nOn October 6, 2015, Little, Brown and Company released the \"\", which includes a nearly-400 page reimagining of the novel with Edward and Bella gender-swapped as Edythe and Beau. The reimagined novel has a more conclusive ending, seemingly precluding its continuation through the remaining three Twilight novels.\n\nThe response to \"Twilight\" has been mixed. While the books have become immensely popular, they have also generated much controversy.\n\n\"Twilight\" has gathered acclaim for its popularity with its target readers. \"The Times\" lauded it for capturing \"perfectly the teenage feeling of sexual tension and alienation.\" Other reviews described \"Twilight\" as an \"exquisite fantasy\", and a \"gripping blend of romance and horror\". Lev Grossman of \"Time\" wrote that the books have a \"pillowy quality distinctly reminiscent of Internet fan fiction\", but still praised the series, comparing it to \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"Harry Potter\":\nThe \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" called the book a \"hot new teen novel\", \"Entertainment Weekly\" called Meyer \"the world's most popular vampire novelist since Anne Rice\", \"The New York Times\" described \"Twilight\" as a \"literary phenomenon\", and Matt Arado of \"Daily Herald\" noted that the \"Twilight\" books have become the \"hottest publishing phenomenon since a certain bespectacled wizard cast his spell on the world.\" The large and diverse online fan community of the series are often noted, sometimes even being called \"cult-like\". Despite this, the series is often considered to have a wider appeal; Crystal Mack of \"Daily Herald\" said, \"While teenage girls are the main audience, young boys and adults of both genders have also been swept up in the phenomenon.\"\nThe author and the series' popularity are often compared with J. K. Rowling and \"Harry Potter\". Describing the fan following of the books, the \"Phoenix New Times\" wrote, \"Meyer's fandom is reminiscent of \"Harry Potter\" mania.\" \"The Daily Telegraph\" described \"Twilight\" as the \"spiritual successor to \"Harry Potter\"\". Rebekah Bradford of \"The Post and Courier\" stated that the series has a \"huge crossover appeal much like the \"Harry Potter\" books before them.\" According to the \"Daily Telegraph\", \"Stephenie Meyer, in particular, has achieved incredible success across all the English-speaking nations and Europe and many will say that her \"Twilight\" series has filled the hole left by \"Harry Potter\".\" Meyer has responded to such comparisons, saying, \"It's terribly flattering to be compared to her, but there's never going to be another J. K. Rowling; that's a phenomenon that's not gonna happen again\", however noting that \"you can compare my fans to her fans more easily [than me to her]. I do think that we both have people who are just really really enthusiastic, and will come miles to see you and be involved, and everybody really cares about our characters.\"\n\nEconomically, the town of Forks, Washington, the setting for the \"Twilight\" series, has improved due to tourism from fans of the books. Forks is visited by an average of 8,000 tourists per month, and has been described as a \"mecca for Twilighters\". In response to plans for the aging Forks High School to be renovated, \"Twilight\" fans have teamed up with Infinite Jewelry Co. and the West Olympic Peninsula Betterment Association to collect donations in an attempt to save the brick appearance or the building altogether.\n\nThe series has garnered some notoriety both over its literary substance and over the type of relationship portrayed in the books.\n\nMany have derided the series as poor writing. While comparing Stephenie Meyer to J. K. Rowling, Stephen King said, \"the real difference [between Rowling and Meyer] is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer, and Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn. She's not very good.\" However, King understood the appeal of the series, adding, \"People are attracted by the stories, by the pace and in the case of Stephenie Meyer, it's very clear that she's writing to a whole generation of girls and opening up kind of a safe joining of love and sex in those books. It's exciting and it's thrilling and it's not particularly threatening because it's not overtly sexual.\"\n\nA quote from Robin Browne (though frequently misattributed to King or Andrew Futral) negatively compares the \"Twilight\" and \"Harry Potter\" book series: \"\"Harry Potter\" is about confronting fears, finding inner strength and doing what is right in the face of adversity… \"Twilight\" is about how important it is to have a boyfriend\".\n\nLaura Miller of Salon.com wrote that \"the characters, such as they are, are stripped down to a minimum, lacking the texture and idiosyncrasies of actual people\", and said that \"\"Twilight\" would be a lot more persuasive as an argument that an 'amazing heart' counts for more than appearances if it didn't harp so incessantly on Edward's superficial splendors.\"\n\nElizabeth Hand of \"The Washington Post\" wrote, \"Meyer's prose seldom rises above the serviceable, and the plotting is leaden.\" The article, featured on the Yahoo! website Shine, also criticized the books and the author's final word on the series was, \"Good books deal with themes of longing and loneliness, sexual passion and human frailty, alienation and fear just as the \"Twilight\" books do. But they do so by engaging us with complexities of feeling and subtleties of character, expressed in language that rises above banal mediocrity. Their reward is something more than just an escape into banal mediocrity. We deserve something better to get hooked on.\"\n\nThe books have also been widely critiqued as promoting, normalizing, and idealizing an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. Sci-fi website io9 noted that Bella and Edward's relationship meets all fifteen criteria set by the National Domestic Violence Hotline for being in an abusive relationship. L. Lee Butler of Young Adult Library Services Association commented how he was unusually hesitant to stock the \"Twilight\" books in his library because he felt the books were \"robbing [teen girls] of agency and normalizing stalking and abusive behavior.\" Many female-oriented and feminist media outlets, like Jezebel, The Frisky, and Salon.com have decried \"Twilight\" as promoting an anti-woman message. \"Bitch\" magazine stated the novels \"had created a new, popular genre of \"abstinence porn\", concluding that, \"In reality, the abstinence message—wrapped in the genre of abstinence porn—objectifies Bella in the same ways that 'real' porn might. The \"Twilight\" books conflate Bella losing her virginity with the loss of other things, including her sense of self and her very life. Such a high-stakes treatment of abstinence reinforces the idea that Bella is powerless, an object, a fact that is highlighted when we get to the sex scenes in \"Breaking Dawn\".\" \"Ms.\" declared that \"Twilight\" promotes a physically abusive relationship and an anti-abortion message. However, writer Angela Aleiss of \"Religion News Service\" said that contrary to popular opinion, Mormons do permit abortion when the mother's life is in danger. Bella's refusal to abort her fetus, along with her quick marriage and pregnancy, instead underscore the Mormon emphasis on family.\n\nVarious psychology experts have come out in agreement with the assessment of the relationship as abusive. Melissa Henson, Director of communication and public education for the Parents Television Council, stated:\nMany entertainment and media outlets have made similar comments on the abusive nature of Bella and Edward's relationship, including \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"Movieline\", and Mediabistro.com.\n\nMeyer has dismissed such criticisms, arguing both that the books center around Bella's choice, which she perceives as the foundation of modern feminism, and that Bella's damsel in distress persona is due only to her humanity. Meyer also added, \"Just because [Bella] doesn't do kung fu and she cooks for her father doesn't make her worthy of that criticism\". Shannon Simcox of \"The Daily Collegian\" has similarly dismissed the criticism surrounding Bella, commenting, \"While Bella plays the perfect damsel in distress that gets herself into sticky situations, she is also very in control of herself. She chose to move to Forks and be in a new place; she constantly faces a bunch of people who want to suck the life right out of her, and she is constantly pleading to become a vampire, too, so she can take care of herself and Edward.\"\n\nIn December 2010, professional singer Matthew Smith, known as Matt Heart, sued Summit Entertainment in the case \"Smith v. Summit Entertainment LLC\". Smith's song \"Eternal Knight\" was posted on several websites accompanied by cover art which Summit claimed used its \"Twilight\" typeface mark. Smith won four of the seven causes of action, including his right to continue distribution of his copyrighted song, under the terms that he remove any reference to \"Twilight\" or the \"Twilight Saga\".\n\nThe \"Twilight\" series made the number five spot on the American Library Association's (ALA) Top Ten List of the Most Frequently Challenged Books of 2009, for being \"Sexually Explicit\", \"Unsuited to Age Group\", and having a \"Religious Viewpoint\".\n\nA screenplay for \"Twilight\" was written by Melissa Rosenberg and has been adapted into a film by Summit Entertainment. The film was directed by Catherine Hardwicke, with Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in the leading roles of Isabella Swan and Edward Cullen, respectively. The movie was released in the United States on November 21, 2008. \"Twilight: The Complete Illustrated Movie Companion\", written by Mark Cotta Vaz, was released October 28.\n\nOn November 22, 2008, following the box office success of \"Twilight\", Summit Entertainment confirmed a sequel, called \"\", based on the second book in the series, \"New Moon\". The film was released on November 20, 2009. \"The Twilight Saga: New Moon\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 20, 2010 through midnight release parties. That same day, Summit Entertainment released \"Twilight in Forks\", a documentary about the primary setting of the \"Twilight\" series, Forks, Washington. Topics Entertainment released its own documentary about Forks and the \"Twilight\" series on March 16, called \"Forks: Bitten by Twilight\".\n\nThe third installment in the series, \"\", was released on June 30, 2010. The fourth installment, \"\" was released November 18, 2011, And the fifth and last installment, \"\" was released November 16, 2012.\n\nWhile the \"Twilight\" series has been a visible presence in many conventions such as ComicCon, there have also been many conventions whose main focus has been on the \"Twilight\" series (books and films). Some notable conventions have been Twicon and a series of \"Official Twilight Conventions\" that are being held by Creation Entertainment.\n\n\n"}

According to NBC's Today News, WNGD \"has become an annual tradition that celebrates weeding, planting flowers and trimming hedges in the buff. While it's linked to a movement of nudists who promote wholesome and unashamed acceptance of the human body, the day is meant to be funny, lighthearted and non-political, founders say.\" \n\nWNGD was founded and is organized by Mark Storey, consulting editor for Nude & Natural magazine and permaculturalist Jacob Gabriel, as a project of Body Freedom Collaborative (BFC). In its early days, Mark Storey had a vision of BFC engaging in \"guerrilla pranksterism\" such as hopping out of a van or showing up spontaneously in an urban environment and engaging in guerilla gardening.\n\nStorey is the current project lead and he introduced the concept to readers of Nude & Natural magazine in 2005 and follow-up stories in later years in the same magazine. Corky Stanton, of Clothes Free International, who was also providing web hosting for World Naked Bike Ride at that time, supported the effort with web site hosting and promotion from the beginning of the project.\n\nIn the New York Daily News, Mark Storey notes that WNGD is not owned by any one organization. \"No particular organization owns World Naked Gardening Day,\" Storey said, and it's not actually one large gathering of horticulturists in Seattle who strip down and shear some shrubs together.\"\n\nWhile the phenomenon quickly spread internationally, little investment has been made by its founders. \"Storey said he and Johnson haven't spent any money or gone to any great lengths to promote World Naked Gardening Day since they initiated it. They helped create a website early on, and then receded into the background. They intended that the idea of an introduction to clothes freedom through gardening was valuable and would grow organically on its own.\"\n\nWNGD was inspired by a combination of Gabriel's and Storey's involvement in and inspiration by the success of World Naked Bike Ride, the first of which was held internationally in 2004 and the enjoyment and simplicity of Storey's experience with his wife, gardening naked in the backyard as well as his experience naked hiking and kayaking. The first annual World Naked Gardening Day event took place on September 10, 2005. In 2007, the event date was moved to the first Saturday in May where it still takes place to this day. The event takes place the day before International Permaculture Day, which takes place on the first Sunday of May.\n\nSummer dates have been suggested due to colder temperate climate temperatures in May, to coincide with a joint World Naked Bike Ride event and for other reasons. But WNGD is about gardening, and gardeners know that spring is a key time to nurture plants. Also, WNGD may be enjoyed both indoors and outside.\n\nIn 2018, the New Zealand Naturist Federation adopted the last weekend in October, that was better suited to the southern hemisphere climate. Horticulture supplier Yates supported the event and supplied Swan Plant seedlings.\n\nAccording to the organizers, \"besides being liberating, nude gardening is second only to swimming as an activity that people are most ready to consider doing nude,\" an assertion described as \"true\" by \"The Hamilton Spectator\". The organization's website claims people throughout the world are \"invited to tend their portion of the world's garden clothed as nature intended.\"\n\nWNGD is endorsed by The Naturist Society, Clothes Free International and American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR), among others. Storey is the co-founder and current project lead of WNGD and moderates the WNGD Yahoo! Discussion group. Although the event is associated with the socio-cultural naturist movement, its founders assert the day is intended to be \"lighthearted,\" and void of politics.\n\nAn AANR press release, published during the sixth annual World Naked Gardening Day, described naked gardening to be a healthy practice. AANR public relations representative Tom Mulhall claims naked gardening may help boost a positive self-image.\n\nBeyond body image, \"Stanton cited fringe benefits of bare, unabashed recreation: the satisfaction of exercising in the great outdoors; the attractiveness of an all-over tan; more vitamin D on your whole body; the unbeatable experience of skinny-dipping if the naturist event involves a beach or a lake.\"\n\nWhile the event is most often done in secluded areas, such as at home, BFC first kicked off the event with its trademark \"guerrilla pranksterism\" and did a photo shoot for the project's web site in a public park. In another year Storey and Gabriel enlisted the help of local free beach users at an unofficial clothing-optional beach park on Lake Washington, in Seattle. Storey has also suggested that some remote hiking location would be quiet enough to host a trail cleanup.\n\nMany people chose not to venture beyond the relative safety of non-public areas. \"It's not about exposing your body to other people,\" said Corky Stanton, of Clothes Free International, an organization that promotes nude recreation. \"It's about body acceptance and being one with nature on your own. ... We actually do these events in secluded areas,\"\n\nDuring the fifth annual World Naked Gardening Day in the United Kingdom, celebrated in 2010, organizers encouraged people to go naked either in their private gardens or in public parks. According to the Sky News Online, organizers of the event thought an \"au naturel joie de vivre\" will bind all communities and people regardless of their background and age.\n\nIn 2009, inspired by the success of both World Naked Bike Ride Seattle and WNGD, along with being inspired by his permaculture schooling at the time, Gabriel founded the Gardens Everywhere Bike Parade (GEBP), with co-organizer Kelda Lorax, a local permaculture designer, advocate, and instructor. It was Kelda who came up with the GEBP name for the event. The ride in part was to take the simplicity and theme of gardening in WNGD and take it more public and deeper into principles of permaculture. The clothing-optional bike ride showcased local permaculture projects as well as general permaculture principles. This same year Gabriel was involved in co-founding the Beacon Food Forest, the first known food forest on public lands.\n\nThe Ride launched from Om Culture in Wallingford, went East on the Burke-Gilman Trail. Local artist Franz and others had staged a body painting and art bike decorating party at that location. The ride then headed North on The Ave and toured the University District, stopped at the University District Farmer's Market and University Heights P-Patch at the University Heights Center. A tour was given by Kelda and the rainwater harvesting system was highlighted.\n\nIt continued up the Ave to a Shiga's Community Garden, which is also a Seattle Department of Neighborhoods Community Garden. At this time the garden was being cleared of invasive weeds left over from a vacant lot into future planting in 2010. By coincidence volunteers were clearing that lot and GEBP helped the group for a few minutes carry out invasive weeds. The Seattle Police responded at Shiga's Garden from a complaint from the stop at the University Farmer's Market and left when the officers where reassured that riders were not going back to the market.\n\nThe ride then left traveled North to Thrive restaurant and enjoyed gourmet raw vegan food prepared by the restaurant staff for the riders. The ride continued to Roosevelt P-Patch and dropped in on a friends garden in the area. The ride continued through the Roosevelt district to Permaculturist Jenny Pell's house, then to Mighty-O Donuts in the Tangletown neighborhood, where the group serenaded, unsuccessfully the workers for donuts. The ride continued to a tour of Seattle Tilth at the Home of the Good Shepherd, took a tour of the grounds and surprised a wedding party taking place in the area bordering Meridian Playground and the Good Shephard Center.\n\nAfter leaving Meridian Playground, the ride went to an intersection repair done with a mural of a giant ladybug. The Wallingford Ladybug, known as Wallybug, is located at the intersection of N 49th Street and Burke Ave N in Wallingford. It was created in 2004. The group then stopped in front of a residence where the homeowners were gardening in their front parking strip and the group sang for them. Another stop was made at a residence offering refreshments to riders, another stop at a neighbor selling organic heirloom produce from her yard and the ride ended at a private residence for a clothing-optional party in a backyard gardening featuring a handmade cobb masonry oven.\n\nA fundraising film party was held at Thrive Cafe on September 9, 2009, which showed footage of the event collected by the riders and photographers.\n\nIn 2013, Ritchie Duncan, contributor to TruTv's Dumb as a Blog, suggested a hybrid event, \"World Naked 'Star Wars' Gardening Day\", encouraging readers to tweet their pictures to @DumbasaBlog with the hashtag #nakedstarwarsgardening. He joked that participants could say \"May the fourth be with you,\", in a nod to the date of the hybrid World Naked 'Star Wars' Gardening Day, which would occur that year (May 4, 2013), the same as the date of Star Wars Day (May Fourth) and the popular Star Wars expression \"May the Force be with you.\"\n\nOne suggested idea was \"Get naked and paint your face red and black like Darth Maul. Attach another rake to the handle of your existing rake for \"nude double lightsaber raking action.\" The blog author, Duncan, joked he has not though much of which franchise characters he would like to see naked gardening but joked, \"I'd hate to have George Lucas digitally add clothes later.\"\n\nAdam and Eve were noted to garden naked, before the fall of man, in the Book of Genesis.\n\nHesiod exhorts farmers: \"When the Atlas-born Pleiades rise, start the harvest—the plowing, when they set . . . This is the rule for the plains, and for those who dwell near the sea and those far from the swelling sea in the valleys and glens, fertile land: sow naked, and plow naked, and harvest naked, if you want to bring in all of Demeter's works in due season, so that each crop may grow for you in its season. \" The Pleiades rise in early May and set in November.\n\nEdna St. Vincent Millay was known to garden nude at the Steepletop estate in New York as part of her Bohemian lifestyle.\n\nWalt Whitman is also known to have written about his naked experiences in nature. In Specimen Day he wrote: \"Sweet, sane, still Nakedness in Nature! --ah if poor, sick, prurient humanity in cities might really know you once more! Is not nakedness then indecent? No, not inherently. It is your thought, your sophistication, your fear, your respectability that is indecent. There come moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear, but are themselves indecent. Perhaps indeed he or she to whom the free exhilarating ecstasy of nakedness in Nature has never been eligible (and how many thousands there are!) has not really known what purity is--nor what faith or art or health really is.\"\n\nActress and PETA spokesperson, Alicia Silverstone, in an interview with Health magazine said \"It probably started when I was doing my garden the first time. I'd be out there, and it would be scorching hot, so I would take off all of my clothes and garden. And then I would jump in the pool and swim - and I always get in the pool naked, because why would you want to put on a bathing suit?\"\n\nOne month prior to the first WNGD event on September 10, 2005, Ian and Barbara Pollard, resident gardening experts on ITV's \" This Morning\", held its first \"clothes optional day\" at Abbey House Gardens in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, England.\n\n\"The New York Times\" ran an article about naked gardening neighbors next-door.\n\n\n\n"}
