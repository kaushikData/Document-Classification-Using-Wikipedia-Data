The term \"08/15\" (nill-eight/fifteen, ) refers to the German Army's standard machine gun, the 08/15 (or MG 08 model 15), by far, the most common German machine gun deployed in World War I. It was manufactured in such large quantities that it became the German Army slang for anything that was standard issue. \n\nThe film follows the story of Private Asch, a German soldier in World War II. The film title implies that Asch, and the soldiers under his command, were unostentatious (i.e. \"run-of-the-mill\") characters deployed on the Eastern Front.\n\nThe last of the \"08/15\" film trilogy ends with Germany being occupied by American soldiers who are portrayed as bubble-gum chewing, slack-jawed, uncultured louts, inferior in every respect to the heroic German soldiers. The only exception is the Jewish emigrant, now a US officer, who is shown as both intelligent and unscrupulous, the fact interpreted by Professor Omer Bartov as implying that the \"real tragedy of World War II was that the Nazis did not get a chance to exterminate all Semites, who have now returned with Germany's defeat to once more exploit the German people\". \"Although Asch is never identified with the Americans – indeed, in the final film of the trilogy, the Americans appear to be nearly as dangerous a foe as the \"SS\".\"\n\n\n"}

It is in oils on canvas, and measures (with uneven edges). Unusually for Poussin, it is signed \"N. Pusin.fe\" [\"fecit\"] on the stone at lower right. By 1637, soon after it was painted, it was owned by Cardinal Gian Carlo de' Medici (16111663), the second son of Grand Duke Cosimo II of Tuscany and was placed in his villa outside Florence.\n\nIt belongs to a group of paintings with a predominately \"coppery\" colour scheme, from which its dating mainly derives. Classicising elements have been added to the usual figures.\n\nThe painting was evidently well-regarded, and 20 painted copies are recorded from approximately the next century, as well as seven print versions made between the 1660s and 1813. There are a number of drawings, some showing what appear to be early thoughts about the composition, though some may not be by Poussin or were created before the painting. As is often the case with Poussin, elements of the painting reflect the works of other artists, including Raphael.\n\nTo the usual cast of the Nativity of Jesus in art are added the earlier scene of the Annunciation to the Shepherds in the distance at the centre, five \"putti\" above, about to shower the scene with flowers, and a woman at left holding a large wicker tray with fruit. The scene takes place in a large but derelict classical building, to which a crude wooden lean-to stable has been added. The golden stone of the building is echoed by the tanned bodies of the shepherds, the cloudy sky, and other elements, giving an unusually unified \"coppery\" colour scheme to the painting, with the blue of the Virgin Mary's mantle and that of the woman carrying the fruit the other prominent colour. The ox, to the right of Joseph, almost disappears into the wall behind him.\n\nUnlike those in the still central scene, the figures in the small background Annunciation to the Shepherds are highly agitated, with extreme and strenuous poses. The gesturing angel is loosely painted in white against the cloud, just above the foremost vine leaves in the basket. Like other figures by Poussin from this period, the foreground figures seem to have a frozen sculptural quality. The figure with a green dress is female. The foremost kneeling shepherd is close to, and perhaps derived from, a shepherd in a painting of the Nativity by Raphael (Vatican Loggie).\n\nOther paintings by Poussin, generally dated to the years between 1633 and 1634, have similar colour schemes. The \"Adoration of the Magi\" in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden (illustrated) is dated 1633; it has a very similar setting but a more varied colour scheme, so the London \"Adoration of the Shepherds\" is assumed to be later than that. The \"Saving of the Infant Pyrrhus\" in the Louvre, with a similar unified \"coppery\" scheme, has now been shown to have been finished by 1634 at the latest, so the London painting is now assigned to 1633–34 with reference to these, and also a drawing with a preparatory sketch on the verso, now in the Royal Collection. This was made for Marshall Charles III de Créquy when he was French ambassador to Rome, resident there between June 1633 and July 1634.\n\nAnother \"coppery-toned\" National Gallery Possin (in 2015 hanging next to this one) is \"The Adoration of the Golden Calf\", also dated 1633–34, largely on the basis of this similarity. This is usually thought to have been painted as a pair with \"The Crossing of the Red Sea\", now National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne; the two remained together until 1945.\n\nThe painting was done when Poussin was approaching the age of 40. He had been in Rome since 1624, and enjoyed some success in the 1620s, in particular when his main patrons were not abroad on embassies. These were Cardinal Francesco Barberini (1597–1679), nephew of the current Pope, Urban VIII (reigned 1623–1644), and his secretary, the antiquarian Cassiano dal Pozzo (1588–1657), who was to remain an important friend and patron of Poussin. However, when in 1628 Barberini secured him the commission for an altarpiece in St Peter's, the \"Martyrdom of St Erasmus\" (Pinacoteca Vaticana), its reception seems to have been lukewarm, which perhaps triggered a change in Poussin's career, along with a period of illness in 1629 or 1630.\n\nAt this time he seems to have abandoned the pursuit of the many rich commissions Rome offered for large paintings for churches and palaces, and henceforth painted only canvases of a relatively small size for \"a small circle of \"cognoscenti\"\", led by dal Pozzo. That this painting quickly passed to a Medici prince-cardinal makes it rather untypical for this period, though during the 1630s awareness of Poussin's talent was growing in the French court, until he was eventually ordered by the king to return to Paris in 1640 (he escaped back to Rome two years later, and never left again).\n\nHis style and subject-matter also changed at the end of the 1620s, switching away from the influence of Italian baroque painters to a classicism influenced by classical sculpture and the High Renaissance. His paintings from about 1629 to 1633 are nearly all drawn from classical mythology, or the epics of Tasso. The Dresden \"Adoration\", dated 1633, perhaps marks the end of this phase, and for the rest of the 1630s his subjects become once again more varied.\n\nNativity scenes are very often given such classical settings. As well as showing off the artist's skill and learning they acted as a reminder of the medieval legend, reported in the popular compilation of the \"Golden Legend\", that on the night of Christ's birth the Basilica of Maxentius in Rome, supposed to house a statue of Romulus, had partly tumbled to the ground, leaving the impressive ruins that survive today.\n\nAnother meaning for the ruined temple went back to 15th-century Early Netherlandish painting, when the usual simple shed of the Nativity stable, little changed from Late Antiquity, had developed into an elaborate ruined temple, initially Romanesque in style, which represented the dilapidated state of the Old Covenant of the Jewish law. In Italian works the architecture of such temples became classical, reflecting the growing interest in the ancient world, and the ruins that remained in many areas.\n\nThe woman with the fruit can be paralleled in some other paintings, and if the work was actually commissioned by Cardinal de' Medici, a reference to a statue of \"Plenty\" by Donatello, now lost but then prominently displayed in the Mercato Vecchio of his home-city of Florence, may have been intended. It was also a Florentine custom to bring gifts of fruit to women after childbirth, no doubt to be placed on their \"desco da parto\". Various meanings might be attached to both the apples and grapes the woman appears to carry, and the types of flowers held by the \"putti\", though other than the jasmine held by the top left \"putto\", the identification of these is not entirely clear.\n\nThe main surviving preparatory drawing is in the British Museum. This is in a horizontal format, just showing the lower part, and may suggest that Poussin originally intended a smaller painting with a horizontal format, although the drawing is cut along its top edge. This includes an upturned pediment stone at bottom left, a low arch in the centre at what is now about halfway up the final composition, and a lamb lying below Jesus. Christ Church Picture Gallery in Oxford has a drawing with the \"putti\", again with differences in the architectural background.\n\nThe painting was still in the collection of Cardinal Gian Carlo de' Medici in a posthumous inventory in 1663, after which it may have moved to France, where a \"Nativity\" attributed to Poussin is recorded in a number of collections for the next century. These include that of Louis II Phélypeaux (1643–1727), better known as the chancellor de Pontchartrain, an important French politician. Gian Lorenzo Bernini noted seeing such a painting in his collection in 1665, and one is recorded in his wife's collection in 1672. Another mention, from 1700, is in the collection of André Le Nôtre (1613–1700), the landscape architect and principal gardener of King Louis XIV of France, and there are two further owners of what was probably the same painting, ending in a posthumous sale in 1761.\n\nAt this point it may have passed to England; in 1795 what was certainly the same painting was in the posthumous sale of Sir Joshua Reynolds' collection at Christie's, where it fetched 205 guineas. It was bought by the painter and dealer Henry Walton who sold it a year later to Sir Thomas Beauchamp-Proctor, 2nd Baronet (1756–1827). It remained in the collections of the Proctor-Beauchamp baronets and their family between 1796 and 1956, when it fetched £29,000 at Sotheby's, bought by an overseas collector. An export licence was deferred, allowing the National Gallery to buy the work for £33,100 in 1957, with funds from the Temple-West Fund, the NACF, and a special Treasury grant. It is catalogued as NG 6277.\n\nThe condition is \"generally good ... but with some wear\". There are some minor pentimenti and retouches. As of 2001, the painting was last \"cleaned and restored\" in 1958, then \"surface cleaned and revarnished\" in 1975.\n\nApart from National Gallery exhibitions since 1957, it has travelled to the Royal Academy in 1880 and 1995, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery 1992–93 and Paris in 1994–95 (Grand Palais).\n\n\n\n"}

After a brief stint in Spain as a tutor to the Russian ambassador's son, Veselovsky continued his education with Heymann Steinthal in Berlin and Prague and spent three years working in the libraries of Italy. Upon his return to Russia, he delivered lectures in Moscow and St. Petersburg and was elected a Member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1876.\n\nVeselovsky's early studies of medieval Italian literature led him to believe that many plots and literary devices were imported to Europe from the Orient through Byzantium. Looking at literature primarily from a genetic point of view, Alexander Veselovsky and his brother Aleksey (1843-1918) attempted to construct a comprehensive theory of the origin and development of poetry. In 1899, the elder brother famously argued that \"the font and syncretic root of poetic genres\" may be traced to ritualized popular games and folk incantations.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, Veselovsky and his followers were criticized for their \"ethnographism\", which allowed \"source study to grow to a hypertrophied degree, thus dissolving the specific character of the literary work into a collection of \"influences\"\". On 14 August 1946 the Central Committee of the Communist Party adopted a resolution specifically condemning \"kowtowing\" to the bourgeois West by the so-called Veselovskyists. The Russian Formalists largely shared a critical view of Veselovsky's theory, although it has been suggested that Veselovsky's doctrine was actually a point from which they evolved \"in a linear, if polemical, way\".\n\nAlthough his work has been largely forgotten by Western scholarship (probably due to lack of translations), Veselovsky has been called \"one of the most erudite and original scholars Russia has produced\" and \"the most remarkable representative of comparative literary study in Russian and European scholarship of the nineteenth century\".\n"}

The outgroup members can be anyone who possesses characteristics that are different from one's own, such as people of different races, religions, cultures, etc. It is a framework for understanding effective intergroup leadership and is conceptualized as a measurable state of mind with tangible consequences.\n\nThe term \"allophilia\" was coined by Harvard professor Todd L. Pittinsky in 2006, after he was unable to find an antonym for prejudice in any dictionary. The term derived from Greek words meaning \"liking or love of the other\".\n\nAllophilia has five statistical factors:\n\nThe Allophilia Scale measures each of these factors. It has been adapted and validated to other languages such as Italian and Spanish, also to various settings, such as to measure positive attitude toward people with dementia, younger and older adults.\nAllophilia, Prejudice, and Positive Intergroup Relations\n\nThe typical remedy for prejudice is to bring conflicting groups into a state of tolerance. However, tolerance is not the logical antithesis of prejudice, but rather is the midpoint between negative feelings and positive feelings toward others. Allophilia enhancement should serve as complement to prejudice reduction.\n\nAllophilia predicts positive relationships with outgroup members. For instance, a study in Spain shows that students having higher allophilia had lower social distance toward people with obesity. Besides, positive experience with outgroup members may increase allophilia, as it is shown in a longitudinal study of a cook's tour in Vietnam. In that study, the participants, who were Americans, reported positive feelings toward Vietnamese mirroring Allophilia facets in nearly 10 years after the event.\n\nIn one study, symhedonia (experiencing empathic joy) has been shown to be more closely associated with allophilia, while sympathy (experiencing empathic sorrow) has been shown to be more strongly associated with prejudice.\n\n\n"}

She was educated at Smith College, Barnard College and Columbia University, where she studied under Meyer Schapiro. She also studied at New York University Institute of Fine Arts with Walter W.S. Cook. Through Michael Chapman (cinematographer), Rose was introduced to many New York artists, including Carl Andre and Frank Stella. In 1961, Rose received a Fulbright to Spain. Stella joined her in Europe and the two were married in 1961 in London. They divorced in 1969.\n\nWith the encouragement of Michael Fried Rose began writing art criticism, which, in 1963, led to a monthly \"New York Letter\" in Art International. In October 1965, Rose published the essay ABC Art in Art in America, in which she described the fundamental characteristics of minimal art.\n\nIn her essay, \"ABC Art\", Rose considers the diverse roots of minimalism in the work of Kasimir Malevich and Marcel Duchamp as well as the choreography of Merce Cunningham, the art criticism of Greenberg, the philosophy of Wittgenstein and the novels of Robbe-Grillet. In examining the historical roots of minimal art in 1960s America, Rose draws a distinction between Malevich's \"search for the transcendental, universal, absolute\" and Duchamp's \"blanket denial of the existence of absolute values.\"\n\nRose grouped some 1960s artists as closer to Malevich, some as closer to Duchamp, and some as between the two. Closer to Malevich are Walter Darby Bannard, Larry Zox, Robert Huot, Lyman Kipp, Richard Tuttle, Jan Evans, Ronald Bladen, Anne Truitt. Closer to Duchamp are Richard Artschwager and Andy Warhol. Between Malevich and Duchamp she places Robert Morris, Donald Judd, Carl Andre, and Dan Flavin. Her conclusion is that minimal art is both transcendental and negative:\n\"The art I have been talking about is obviously a negative art of denial and renunciation. Such protracted asceticism is normally the activity of contemplatives or mystics...Like the mystic, in their work these artists deny the ego and the individual personality, seeking to evoke, it would seem, the semihypnotic state of blank unconsciousness.\"\n\nShe also contrasts minimal art with Pop Art:\n\"...if Pop Art is the reflection of our environment, perhaps the art I have been describing is its antidote, even if it is a hard one to swallow.\"\n\nFrom 1962 until 1965, Rose was a New York correspondent for Art International; a contributing editor at Art in America from 1965 through 1971; at Vogue (magazine) from 1966 until 1988; and at Artforum from 1965 until 1973. From 1970 until 1971, Rose served as the first director of the museum at the University of California, Irvine. She was also an art critic for New York (magazine) from 1971 until 1977, art editor at the Partisan Review from 1975 until 1996, associate editor at Arts magazine from 1978 until 1988, and editor-in-chief of the \"Journal of Art\" from 1988 through 1991. Rose served as a consultant to Condé Nast from 1970 until 1987 and to the GSA Art in Architecture program from 1990 to 1992. From 1981 until 1985, Rose held the position of senior curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston where she curated shows including \"Miró in America\" in 1982 and \"\nFernand Léger and the Modern Spirit: An Avant-Garde Alternative to Non-Objective Art,\" also in 1982.

It differs from bed-rest, a form of non-invasive treatment that is usually part of recovery or the limitation of activities. Some of the more serious consequences of being bedridden is the high risk of developing thrombosis and muscle wasting (atrophy). Its meaning is derived from a middle English term (bedrid) from a 1300s past tense form of riding a bed.\n\nThis is a voluntary medical treatment still used today to help cure illness. Current views regarding this treatment are that there are no benefits for most conditions studied. Though bedrest may still be prescribed for pregnant women, it is now considered dangerous. Those who are bedridden can develop complications related to feeding.\n\nBeing bedridden leads to many complications such as loss of muscle strength and endurance. Contractures, osteoporosis from disuse and the degeneration of joints can occur. Being confined to bed can add to the likelihood of developing an increased heart rate, decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and thromboembolism. People with disabilities who are bedridden are at risk for developing pressure sores. Those who are bedridden are at risk in a house fire due to their lack of mobility. Showering can become impossible. Bedsores develop if a person: who spends most or all of the day in bed without changing position Being confined to bed may result in a person remaining passive and withdrawn. The ability to transfer to a chair and the negative attitudes of caregivers is associated with continued confinement to bed and reduction of such requests. Those who are confined to bed have risks related to falls. Falling from a bed can result in injury.\n\nOne recommendation for preventing the complications of being bedridden is to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet that contains enough calories and protein needed for optimum health. If someone is confined to bed changing position at least every two hours can help prevent complications in addition to change sheeting and bedclothes immediately if they are soiled, and using items that can help reduce pressure, such as pillows or foam padding.\n\nOne Indian study of care given to bedridden individuals at home found that family members made up 82% of caregivers. A high rate of medical complications was reported, including pressure ulcers and urinary tract infections.\n"}

Bucherer is a Swiss \"haute horlogerie\" company based in Lucerne, Switzerland, which manufactures luxury men's and women's mechanical watches. Since its founding in 1888, the company has been wholly owned by the Bucherer family, making Carl F. Bucherer one of the oldest luxury Swiss watchmakers continuously held by the founding family. The company is run by the original family's third generation, with Jörg G. Bucherer serving as chairman of the board. \n\nThe watch models of Carl F. Bucherer can be distinguished by certain functions including the chronograph, flyback, tachymeter, tourbillon as well as indicators and displays such as big date and day, power reserve, 24 hours, moon phases, three time zones, calendar, and perpetual calendar.\n\nIn 1888, Carl Friedrich Bucherer established his first boutique selling watches and jewelry in Lucerne, Switzerland. In 1919, Carl Friedrich Bucherer launched his first ladies’ watch collection in the art deco style. He is one of the first watchmakers to adopt the watch strap, which at the time was still a revolutionary concept. By 1948, the company was focusing on sporty chronographs that prominently displayed the current date.\n\nBy 1968, Carl F. Bucherer had manufactured around 15,000 high-precision, certified chronometers, making the company one of the top three Swiss producers of these specialized timepieces. In 1969, the company became part of a Swiss consortium for the development and production of the first quartz movement for wristwatches, the Beta 21.\n\nIn 1976, Jörg G. Bucherer, the third generation of the family, took over the company. In 2001, the Carl F. Bucherer brand was repositioned and the company launched the Patravi watch collection. In 2005, the company filed a patent for the monopusher mechanism of the Patravi TravelTec watch, which permits the parallel display of three time zones.\n\nIn 2007, Carl F. Bucherer acquired Téchniques Horlogères Appliquées of Sainte-Croix, Switzerland and incorporated it into the company as Carl F. Bucherer Technologies. The acquisition enables the company to research, develop, and produce its own manufacture movements and modules for additional functions. This leads in the following year to the company's launch of the CFB A1000 manufacture movement, which features a peripheral motor. In 2014, the Manero PowerReserve becomes the first Carl F. Bucherer model to receive a unique laser signature in order to ensure product authenticity and quality. From that year, all models are equipped with this technology.\n\nIn order to increase its production capacity, Carl F. Bucherer moved its production workshops from Nidau to a larger production site in Lengnau, Bern in 2002. In 2015, Carl F. Bucherer announced that its manufacturing will be consolidated to a new factory in Lengnau in order to optimize production processes and its value-added chain, as well as increase the scope of vertical manufacturing.\n\nThe company currently sells about 25,000 watches a year (around 60% men, 40% women) . The price range varies between CHF 5,000 and CHF 30,000 with some exception over CHF 400,000. The world market is divided between Europe with 40%, Asia also 40% and rest of the world, including US market with 20%. \n\nThe CFB A1000 caliber has the first reliably functioning, peripherally-mounted rotor, which is made of tungsten. The peripheral rotor provides power when turning in either direction and allows for full visual display of the movement. The A1000 movement includes the patented \"Dynamic Shock Absorption\" (DSA) system for effective shock absorption.\n\nAt BaselWorld 2016, Carl F. Bucherer introduced the CFB A2000 manufacture movement. The A2000 retains the A1000 caliber's signature winding mechanism but is enhanced from a 3hz to a 4Hz beat rate \"for increased precision and a newly free-sprung balance for increased resistance to shock-induced timing deviation.\" The A2000 has the COSC Swiss Chronometer certification to attest to its high-level performance.\n\nCarl F. Bucherer's new Manero Peripheral model, also introduced at BaselWorld 2016, is driven by the CFB A2000-based CFB A2050 caliber. This watch marks the launch of the CFB A2000 movement family. The new Manero Flyback model features the CFB 1970 caliber, \"which is controlled by a gearwheel and also provides a flyback function, allowing multiple time intervals to be measured in quick succession.\"\n\nAs of 2014, the company's manufacture movements have been protected against counterfeiting by special laser technology. Developed by the Swiss company Mimotec SA, the CLR-LIGA process imprints a unique signature on the surface of the watch movement using diffractive nano-structuring that can then only be authenticated with a specialized laser scanning device.\n\nCarl F. Bucherer watches are divided into five core collections:\n<br>\n\nIn 2013, Carl F. Bucherer celebrated its 125th anniversary with an international roadshow presenting over 200 historical watches and the history of the company. The company also released four limited edition watches: the Manero MoonPhase, Manero Tourbillon, Alacria RoyalRose, and the Patravi TravelTec FourX. A jubilee volume, \"125 Years' Swiss History of Time,\" further commemorated the history of the company.\n\nIn 2014, Carl F. Bucherer partnered with the Swiss National Football Association, providing each member of the Swiss national football team a Patravi ScubaTec SFV Special Edition watch ahead of that year's World Cup. The logo of the Swiss Football Association is at 6 o'clock on the bezel. The back case of each watch has an engraving of the individual player's name.\n\nAs of 1 July 2016, Carl F. Bucherer is the \"Official Timekeeper\" for the Swiss national football teams for a period of four years. As part of this partnership, Swiss national players are wearing the exclusive Patravi ScubaTec SFV timepiece. The press conference announcing the partnership was attended by Stephan Lichtsteiner, captain of the Swiss national team, and star player Granit Xhaka.\n\nIn the 2018 movie Deadpool 2 the character Cable, a time-travelling soldier played by Josh Brolin, uses a time-machine on his wrist to move through time. In close-ups of the device it is inscribed with the Carl F.

The religious thought and the use of vernacular Koine Greek, full of innovative orthography,syntax and grammar, suggests that they may also represent something at the root of religion in Phrygia and Lydia. Marijana Ricl has argued that the practice of confession is a reminiscence of Hittite religion. According to Schnabel E.J it was a counter-move prompted by the increasing success of the Christian missionaries. Indeed, beside the scheme of confession/redemption, phraseology and terms remind of Greek New Testament: hamartia (sin), parakletos (advocator), doulos tou theou (slave of god), kyrios (master), basileus (king). Another point for discussion is the punishment of sexual transgressions, which further relates the inscriptions to Christianity and the concept of chastity in ; in contrast to the previous perception of sexuality inside the religion (Hieros gamos, Sacred prostitution, Aphrodite Pandemos).\n\nSome indicating names or epithets of deities engaged in the inscriptions are: Men (Axiottenos, Artemidoros), Meter (mother), Zeus (Aithrios, Keraunios, Soter), Apollo, Hypsistos, Anaitis, Attis, Dionysos, Hades, Herakles, Sabazios, Batenos, Nemesis, Asclepius, Tyrannos, Basileus, Theos Strapton and Bronton, Hecate, Artemis etc.\n\nAccording to George Petzl, a trial of sacred theatre did take place in the sanctuary; Theodoros was convicted and jailed. Zeus was impersonated by a priest. According to Ender Varinlioglu \"phylake\" jail is used metaphorically. Blindness was the jail/punishment upon Theodoros in order to be salvated from his \"licentious sexual activities\".\n\n"}

The book of sixteen personal essays explores how Troncoso made the leap from growing up poor along the Mexico-U.S. border to the Ivy League, his wife's battle against breast cancer, his struggles as a writer in New York and Texas, fatherhood, and interfaith marriage.\n\n“On good days I feel I am a bridge. On bad days I just feel alone,” Sergio Troncoso writes in this collection of personal essays in which he seeks to connect the humanity of his Mexican family to people he meets on the East Coast, including his wife’s Jewish kin. Raised in a home steps from the Mexican border in El Paso, Texas, Troncoso crossed what seemed an even more imposing border when he left home to attend Harvard College.\n\nInitially, “outsider status” was thrust upon him; later, he adopted it willingly, writing about the Southwest and Chicanos in an effort to communicate who he was and where he came from to those unfamiliar with his childhood world. He wrote to maintain his ties to his parents and his abuelita, and to fight against the elitism he experienced at an Ivy League school. “I was torn,” he writes, “between the people I loved at home and the ideas I devoured away from home.”\n\nTroncoso writes to preserve his connections to the past, but he puts pen to paper just as much for the future. In his three-part essay entitled “Letter to My Young Sons,” he documents the terror of his wife’s breast cancer diagnosis and the ups and downs of her surgery and treatment. Other essays convey the joys and frustrations of fatherhood, his uneasy relationship with his elderly father, and the impact his wife’s Jewish heritage and religion have on his Mexican-American identity.\n\n\"Crossing Borders: Personal Essays\" reveals a writer, father and husband who has crossed linguistic, cultural and intellectual borders to provoke debate about contemporary Mexican-American identity. Challenging assumptions about literature, the role of writers in America, fatherhood and family, these essays bridge the chasm between the poverty of the border region and the highest echelons of success in America. Troncoso writes with the deepest faith in humanity about sacrifice, commitment and honesty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA reviewer from the \"Portland Book Review\" wrote in a four-starred review: \"\"Crossing Borders\" is a series of personal essays by author Sergio Troncoso that bring you into his family and his personal growth. Troncoso writes about crossing personal, religious, and cultural borders, as well as literal borders, and brings the reader into experiences they are not likely to have on their own. \"Crossing Borders\" is a book the reader will get invested in, if only to learn more about the family being talked about in the essays. Most heart-wrenching are the three pieces entitled “Letter to My Young Sons,” which details their mother’s battle with cancer and shows a father’s love for his children. If a reader only reads one essay, though, it should be “Why Should Latinos Write Their Own Stories,” a piece that shows the importance of preserving heritage and teaching the world things that they may not know about Latinos. In all, Troncoso’s book is a piece of artwork and a piece of heritage that everyone, not just Latinos, should take the time to read.\" \n\n----A reviewer from the \"El Paso Times\" wrote: \"Sergio Troncoso's \"Crossing Borders: Personal Essays\" is an engrossing and revealing peek behind the curtain of one writer's creative process, development and struggles.\n\nThe reader is treated to crisp and evocative prose that wades into the murky waters of ethnic, religious and familial identities….\n\nIn three heartbreaking interconnected essays, \"Letter to my Young Sons (Parts One, Two and Three),\" he begins: \"Two weeks ago, Aaron and Isaac, I learned your mother Laura has breast cancer.\" We are plunged into the world of surgical options, chemotherapy and physical therapy. Troncoso skillfully and in exquisite detail allows us the privilege of entering into his world as the disease affects not only his wife but also all who love her.\n\nThe fact that Troncoso's beloved wife is Jewish imbues many of these essays with a sense of wonder and appreciation of a religion and culture vastly different from the Mexican Catholicism of his youth. In \"Fresh Challah,\" we learn of his newfound love for the traditional Jewish bread, which he can find in his favorite New York bakeries: \"The loaves of Challah glistened under the bright white light, and seemed soft and steamy from the other side of the cash register.\" Troncoso brilliantly uses challah as a springboard for an exploration of his El Paso roots as embodied by his late grandmother, Doña Dolores Rivero….\n\nTroncoso has already made his mark in the literary world. But if \"Crossing Borders\" is any guide, he will continue to spin stories and explain the writer's life for many years to come.\" \n\n----\"Crossing Borders: Personal Essays\" won the Bronze Award for Essays from \"ForeWord Reviews\", and Second Place for Best Biography in English in the International Latino Book Awards. \"The Hispanic Reader\" chose it as one of the best books of 2011.\n\n"}
{"id": "28833560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28833560", "title": "DmC: Devil May Cry", "text": "DmC: Devil May Cry\n\nDmC: Devil May Cry is an action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by Ninja Theory and published by Capcom for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. It is a reboot of the \"Devil May Cry\" series. Announced in late 2010 during the Tokyo Game Show, the game is set in an alternate reality to the mainline \"Devil May Cry\" series.\n\nThe game's story focuses on the player character Dante, a young man at the start of his saga. Dante is a Nephilim: half-angel, half-demon. He is partnered with his twin brother, Vergil, and is on a quest to kill the Demon King Mundus, who murdered their mother and condemned their father to banishment. Players can use Dante's iconic sword, Rebellion, and signature handguns, Ebony and Ivory, as well as a variety of other melee weapons and firearms to defeat enemies. The game also introduces Angel Mode and Demon Mode, which are modifiers to Dante's moveset.\n\nThe re-imagination of the \"Devil May Cry\" series was requested by Capcom, resulting in a total reboot. Capcom chose Ninja Theory to develop the game, assisting them to ensure that gameplay was reminiscent, but distinct, compared to previous titles. Early reaction to the game was widely negative, generally as a result of Dante's visual redesign; nevertheless, \"DmC\" received positive reviews from critics upon release, but less favorable reception among fans. Critics praised the gameplay, art style, and story of the game, as well as the redesigned Dante. The game ultimately failed to meet Capcom's sales expectations.\n\nA DLC expansion for the game, titled \"Vergil's Downfall\", which takes place after the main game and features Dante's brother Vergil as the playable character, was released on 23 March 2013. A remastered edition of the full game, titled \"DmC: Definitive Edition\", running at 1080p/60fps and including all downloadable content, new costumes and new gameplay features such as a manual targeting system, was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 10 March 2015. The \"Definitive Edition\" and the original PC version were developed by Q-LOC.\n\n\"DmC: Devil May Cry\" is an action-adventure hack and slash video game. Players take on the role of Dante as he uses his powers and weaponry to fight against enemies and navigate the treacherous Limbo. Like previous games in the series, Dante can perform combos by attacking with his sword, Rebellion, and shooting with his twin pistols, Ebony and Ivory. New to the series are modifiers to Dante's moveset, known as Angel Mode and Devil Mode, activated by holding down one of the trigger buttons. When in Angel mode, Dante's sword attacks change to the Osiris, a speedy scythe type weapon, whilst Devil mode uses the slower but more powerful axe, Arbiter. These modes also alter Dante's mobility. Using Angel mode allows Dante to pull himself towards enemies and various points in each level, whilst Devil mode lets Dante pull enemies and objects towards him. Dante is also able to dash across large gaps in Angel mode. All of these moves can be used in conjunction with each other to perform massive combos, which are ranked based on the damage the player makes. When enough power has been gathered, Dante can activate Devil Trigger mode, which slows down time around him and levitates enemies into the air, allowing him to perform much stronger attacks. Like previous games, Dante can collect various types of souls which can be used to recover health, purchase items and upgrade Dante's moveset.\n\nThe game is set in an alternate reality of the series. The game's story takes place in Limbo City, a modern-day city secretly controlled by all-powerful demons, manipulating humanity through the comforts of life, with the demons themselves residing in a parallel plane called 'Limbo'. Living on the fringes of the brainwashed society is Dante, a young man at odds with the demons who constantly hunt him, and the civilian authorities they control. Dante is warned by a young woman named Kat that he is in danger just as a Hunter demon drags him into Limbo. Dante navigates the Bellevue Pier's carnival and kills the demon with Kat's aid, who can see into Limbo with her psychic powers. Dante returns to the human world and accepts Kat's offer to meet with her boss, Vergil.\n\nAlong the way, Kat explains that Vergil leads \"The Order\", a rogue vigilante organisation intent on exposing the demons and releasing the world from their control. Vergil tells Dante that with his help the Order can bring down the demons. Dante learns that he and Vergil are not only long lost twin brothers but also Nephilim, the children of Angel and Demon and the only beings capable of killing the cruel demon king Mundus. Their demon father Sparda was Mundus' chief lieutenant in the war against the angels until he betrayed Mundus when he fell in love with the angel Eva and sired the twins. Mundus, afraid of the Nephilim, attacked the family and killed Eva. Sparda spirited his sons to safety, wiped their memories for their own protection and gave each a sword (Rebellion for Dante, Yamato for Vergil). Mundus imprisoned Sparda and condemned him to eternal torture and has hunted Dante ever since. After learning of his past, Dante resolves to help Vergil bring down Mundus and his regime.\n\nDante, with help from Kat, gradually takes down Mundus' operations. During the final stages of his campaign, Dante witnesses a SWAT team raid the Order's headquarters, killing everyone in sight. Dante rescues Vergil from Limbo but he is helpless to protect Kat from being brutally beaten and dragged back to Mundus' lair. Dante then kidnaps Lilith, Mundus' demon concubine carrying Mundus' unborn child, and offers to trade her to Mundus for Kat. During the exchange, Vergil kills Lilith, her child and the SWAT troops. The three allies narrowly escape as Mundus tears much of city apart in an outburst of power that depletes the Hellgate, a portal to the demon world within his stronghold in Silver Sacks Tower. Kat, recovering from her injuries, leads the brothers through a detailed plan to infiltrate the Towers and defeat Mundus. Dante draws Mundus out of his lair and Vergil closes the Hellgate, rendering Mundus mortal. Mundus forms a massive body for himself and confronts the brothers, but Dante lands the killing blow to destroy Mundus for good. Limbo collapses into the human world, making demons visible to humans and creating chaos and pandemonium worldwide.\n\nAfter Mundus' defeat, Vergil reveals his true intentions: with their family avenged, he intends to rule humanity in Mundus' place. Vergil argues that as their saviours, they must protect humans \"from themselves\" yet he callously dismisses the human Kat's role in saving humanity. Dante is appalled at Vergil's attitude and defeats him in a climactic sword fight. Kat stops Dante from killing his brother and Vergil leaves in disgrace. Faced with a world now infested with demons and abandoned by his own brother, Dante questions his own identity, and Kat comforts him by claiming that he is \"Dante, nothing more and nothing less\".\n\nThe DLC chapter \"Vergil's Downfall\" follows Vergil after escaping from Dante. He finds himself in an unknown dimension, where he is guided by the voice of Eva to \"head toward the lights\". Vergil reaches the light area but is stopped by illusions of Kat and Dante, the latter of whom stabs him again. Vergil is saved by a hollow version of himself and is transported to an area where he has to fight to heal his wounds. During his journey Vergil kills the illusions to heal his wounds, and leaves Eva to mourn after discovering what a monster he has chosen to become. Vergil later defeats his hollow counterpart and takes his amulet. Vergil then returns to the real world and encounters demons, who begin to bow at his feet. Confident in his future, Vergil becomes the new Demon King and leads his new army to the unknown.\n\nThe game was officially announced by Capcom at their press conference during the 2010 Tokyo Game Show in September, confirming an earlier rumour in the May 2010 issue of \"Game Informer\" which said that the fifth \"Devil May Cry\" game would be developed by Ninja Theory. The Japanese Capcom staff told the Western staff to make a game with a different direction. Although their previous game, \"Devil May Cry 4\", was a commercial success the staff thought about rebooting the series taking into account how other game series had better sales. They chose Ninja Theory, impressed with their work on \"Heavenly Sword\" which the staff thought would work with a \"Devil May Cry\" game. Ninja Theory's creative director Tameem Antoniades stated that \"DmC\"s system would contain mechanics that would set him apart from other action titles, in particularly \"Bayonetta\", developed by PlatinumGames and directed by the creator of \"Devil May Cry\", Hideki Kamiya. Lead producer Alex Jones stated they still wanted to compete with Platinum in terms of gameplay and storytelling. The idea of a town being alive that wishes to kill the player was added a new element never seen before in the \"Devil May Cry\" series. The actions of Limbo Town are inspired by previous \"Devil May Cry\" games, where the environments would close whenever Dante was surrounded by enemies. Combat designer Rahni Tucker commented on how newcomers to the series have difficulties understanding how advance players from the classic \"Devil May Cry\" games could perform several combos that combined multiple skills and weapons. As a result, she designed the combat to be appeal to newcomers so that they could easily perform elaborated combos, while still offering gameplay that advance players would enjoy.\n\nMost of the game was finished as of April 2012 with Capcom aiding Ninja Theory in tweaking few aspects for the final product. Capcom became heavily involved in the combat system to ensure the character's responsive moves and add new air combos never seen before in the franchise. The development team included over ninety members with nearly ten of them being from Capcom. While Capcom's Hideaki Itsuno oversaw the project, Jones and Motohide Eshiro acted as producers. They wanted to aid the Ninja Theory developers in making \"DmC\" play more like the previous \"Devil May Cry\" games. The release of the PC version was delayed for a faster release of the console iterations. However, Ninja Theory was planning to start launching of the PC version shortly afterwards the console version, aiming for the shortest gap possible. This depended on the time that the PC version finishes development. As a result of speculation regarding Vergil being a playable character, Jones stated that Dante would be the only one controlled by the player. The game uses the Unreal Engine.\n\n\"DmC\" is the first Ninja Theory game written by Tameem Antoniades. Dante's design was originally meant to be similar to that of previous games, but Capcom told the Ninja Theory staff it had to be completely different to appeal to a younger demographic. While the original Dante was designed from a Japanese perspective, the new one was made from a Western perspective. The final model was inspired by Christopher Nolan's film \"The Dark Knight\" as Tameem Antoniades from Ninja Theory commented they wished to make the character realistic. In an interview published by \"Official Xbox Magazine\", Jones explained that he has received numerous death threats in the form of comic books and a metal song due to the controversial decision to reboot the series. Antoniades responded to criticism stating they would not change the design as the character is supposed to fit within the game's setting. Antoniades stated that the gameplay would be similar to previous \"Devil May Cry\" games. In November 2011, an extended trailer and new concept art was released. In May 2012, Capcom announced they expect the game to ship 2 million copies by the ending of this fiscal year without giving yet a proper release date. The music for the game was composed by electronic groups Noisia and Combichrist. A playable demo was released on 20 November 2012.\n\nIn December 2014, Capcom announced that the definitive edition of the game is being released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game contains numerous new improvements and features such as the 1080p resolution and 60 fps frame rate, rebalanced gameplay, all downloadable content available to the previous generation versions, a new Bloody Palace mode for Vergil, a Turbo Mode which gives a 20 percent boost to game speed, Hardcore mode which increases the game's difficulty, Gods Must Die difficulty level wherein enemies immediately use Devil Trigger and deal 2.5 times the normal damage, Must Style mode wherein enemies can only be damaged when the style rank is S and above, new costumes unavailable to the previous versions, updated trophies and achievements, and new leaderboards for Hardcore mode.\n\nA few days after the release of the game on PC, the first \"Costume Pack\" downloadable content (DLC) was released for all consoles. The packs contains several outfits for Dante to use in the main game, which includes a \"\" outfit, a \"Dark Dante\" outfit and a \"Neo Dante\" outfit.\n\nOn 20 February 2013, the second DLC for the game, called \"Bloody Palace\", was released. The free DLC is a survival mode, pitting players against 101 waves of enemies and bosses. Along with \"Bloody Palace\", there is also a \"Weapons Bundle\" DLC, which includes three sets of skins (Bone, Gold and Samurai) for three in-game weapons (Arbiter, Osiris and Revenant). The bundle also unlocks two in-game perks, Orb Harvester and Item Finder, plus gives the player three upgrade points. The skin packs were previously available as store-exclusive pre-order DLCs for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions.\n\nOn 6 March 2013, the fourth DLC, \"Vergil's Downfall\", was released. The DLC adds a new section in the main game, giving players a new single-player campaign featuring Vergil as the main character. The DLC has its own leaderboard, stats and set of trophies. This DLC is available for free for those who have pre-ordered the game on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.\n\nBefore the game was released, early reception to the new design of Dante and change in direction of the series was negative. The series' original creator, Hideki Kamiya, was negative about the game's direction and stated he was \"missing\" Dante although in later tweets he expected people to try the game. Video game publications 1UP.com and GamesRadar found such claims exaggerated, with the former finding the demo's gameplay and humour enjoyable and the latter being optimistic about how the release of the game could affect the franchise. Various other sites also listed it as one of the most anticipated games of 2012 stating that, despite the controversy the game caused, it looked promising, owing to the presentation and the fact the gameplay had yet to be tested. On September 2012, Capcom US producer Alex Jones claimed that some of the negative response had turned positive. Dante's voice actor from \"Devil May Cry 3\" and \"4\", Reuben Langdon, while expressing disappointment with Dante's characterisation, had positive impressions about the game and urged fans to try it.\n\n\"DmC: Devil May Cry\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nThe game's story received positive responses from critics. Jose Otero from 1UP.com thought that the story successfully combined with the game's gameplay. In addition, he praised the quality of the game's well-directed cutscenes. Ryan Clements from IGN considered the game's storytelling a refinement for the series. However, he criticised the length of the game's campaign, which he thought was too short. Ryan Taljonick from GamesRadar criticised the game's campaign as he called it \"predictible\". He considered it a missed opportunity for \"DmC\".\n\nThe game's gameplay also received positive responses. Otero called the combat flexible, and thought that the developer had created a lot of memorable levels and stages with the use of Limbo. Rich Stanton from Eurogamer praised the flow of combat, and thought that the use of the Rebellion in the game \"an awesome achievement\". Despite that, he criticised the platforming section of the game, which he found boring. He further criticised the design of the game's boss battles, which he thought, was very disappointing. Clements thought that the game's combat system was the \"most intelligent design to date\", in which he praised the game's simple user interface and combo system. Despite that, he criticised the game's camera, which he thought had failed to catch up with the combat. Juba praised the game's combat variety and accessible controls. He also thought that the game's gameplay significantly increases the replayability of the game.\n\nThe game's art style received acclaim. Stantion thought that the game's art-style is striking to look at. Clements praised the game's visuals, which he described as \"stunning\". Joe Juba from \"Game Informer\" also praised the game's artistic direction, and he thought that the game's visuals install a sense of unpleasantness and surrealism to the game's alternate universe. The game's boss design was praised by Taljonick, but he expressed disappointment that these enemies are not fun to play with. In addition, he criticised the lack of enemy variety in the game.\n\nOtero praised Ninja Theory for removing some of Dante's old and unappealing personalities, and making him a protagonist that is approachable for players. He described it as \"a fresh and imaginative take on Dante\". Clements thought that the redesigned hero is more relatable for players. Rich Stanton from Eurogamer is also positive about Dante's re-design, calling it one of the best reinventions of a character in gaming history. In contrast, Chris Schilling from VideoGamer.com was negative about the redesign, as he found the new Dante lacking some of the original's iconic features.\n\nWith the announcement of Devil May Cry 5, Producer Matt Walker reiterated that while Capcom is returning to the original series \"...this isn’t a slight at Ninja Theory or DmC at all. We all love DmC.” Matt explains “Itsuno-san himself has explicitly stated that in his mind, DmC is just as important as any of the other titles in the series, and he’s just as proud of it.” Continuing, “That game had an amazing world all its own, that could only have been produced by the amazing artists and imaginations at Ninja Theory.\" \n\nCapcom initially hoped to ship 2 million copies by the end of its financial year; later, it revised its predictions to 1.2 million copies shipped. Reasons given by Capcom included a \"delayed response to the expanding digital contents market,\" \"insufficient coordination between the marketing and the game development divisions in overseas markets,\" and a \"decline in quality due to excessive outsourcing\", though whether or not any of the comments were applicable to \"DmC: Devil May Cry\" or Capcom itself was left ambiguous. The game sold 116,000 units in its first week in Japan and made the top spot in the charts. The game also reached the top spot in the UK's sales charts, though only made a third of the sales of \"Devil May Cry 4\". As of June 2018, 2.4 million copies of the original version have been sold worldwide. Capcom stated that the sales of the original game were \"solid\" but noted that the game did not catch Eastern gamers' attention and made less than its previous iteration, \"Devil May Cry 4\". Capcom reported in September 2015 that the company was \"very happy\" with the sales of the Definitive Edition.\n\n"}
{"id": "44984143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44984143", "title": "Doll hat", "text": "Doll hat\n\nA doll hat (sometimes doll's hat) is a women's millinery design scaled down to suggest a hat that could be worn by a doll. It can be of any design and is generally worn at the front of the head. The hat is usually held in place with a band of fabric or elastic secured at the back of the head.\n\nThe doll hat had periods of popularity in both the 18th and 19th centuries. This was an era of elaborate hairstyles and the hat was a decorative accessory rather than serving a practical function.\n\nDoll hats became popular again in the 1930s. A report in \"The Times\" in 1937 on the latest London millinery described a miniature bonnet as among the key introductions: \"A hat that looks like a doll's hat has been made of Leghorn; the floral topknot of the evening translated, as it were, into daytime wear. It needs only ribbon strings to reproduce the young matron's bonnet of the Victorian era\". As with earlier version of the hat, this was a decorative style suited to occasion wear. A fashion report in 1938 described an Edwardian-style model of indigo blue feathers decorated with a winged bird as ideal for: \"grander occasions or the theatre\".\n\nLater that year, the paper reported a new fashion for vivid doll hats in fuchsia, violet or Florentine blue worn with all-black outfits. The paper added that when a black doll hat was chosen, it should have a contrasting veil in a bright shade such as blue or pink matched with the same hue in gloves or buttonhole.\n\nThe popularity of miniature hat continued into World War II. In the United States, the absence of imports from French milliners inspired American designers to innovate. Variations on the beret, bowler and boater were introduced – along with forward tilted miniature hats. Although American \"Vogue\" magazine warned its readers in 1941 that doll hat designs were: \"definitely not for the unselfconfident\", the design became very popular during the war years.\n\nWhile many versions of the doll hat replicated traditional straw hats in miniature, variations included scaled down witches' hats and Welsh hats.\n\n"}

On 21 October 1994 Dr Keyser discovered the DNH 7 (Eurydice) skull, the most complete \"Paranthropus robustus\" skull ever found. It is also considered a rare female skull of \"P. robustus\". DNH 8, a male mandible called \"Orpheus\" was also discovered at the same time and adjacent to DNH 7. Colin Menter directed research and excavations at the site from 2010 until 2016. Excavations at the site were conducted by technical assistants in the early years and by a number of field schools in the latter years. These include the University of Florence, Italy (Prof Jacopo Moggi-Cecchi; 2006-2012), the University of Victoria, Canada (2011, 2012, 2014), and La Trobe University, Australia (Prof Andy Herries; 2013–present). The permit and excavations at the site were taken over by Stephanie Baker of the University of Johannesburg in 2017 in collaboration with Prof Andy Herries of La Trobe University (& the University of Johannesburg) as part of an Australian Research Council Discovery Project (2017–21). This also involves collaborations with Prof David Strait of Washington University in St Louis, who runs a US based field school as well as researchers from South Africa, Australia, the US and Italy.\n\nAll the hominin remains have been recovered from the area of the classic area of the site known as the Drimolen Main Quarry (DMQ), and include remains of \"Paranthropus robustus\" and early \"Homo\". DMQ dates to sometime between 2.0 and 1.4 Ma (the same age as the site of Swartkrans). DMQ has also yielded some of the world's oldest bone tools and some of South Africa's oldest stone tools.\n\nIn 2013 a new fossil deposit was discovered around away from the Main Quarry that is known as the Drimolen Makondo (DMK). DMK has not yielded any hominin remains but has been dated to a much older time period around 2.61 Ma, making it similar in age to sites such as Sterkfontein and the Makapansgat Limeworks.\n\n"}

The name El Malpais is from the Spanish term \"Malpaís\", meaning \"badlands\", due to the extremely barren and dramatic volcanic field that covers much of the park's area.\n\nIt is on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, one of the designated New Mexico Scenic Byways.\n\nThe lava flows, cinder cones, and other volcanic features of El Malpais are part of the Zuni-Bandera volcanic field, the second largest volcanic field in the Basin and Range Province. This volcanically active area on the southeast margin of the Colorado Plateau is at the intersection of the Rio Grande Rift Basin, with its deep normal faulting, and the ancient Jemez Lineament. These two features provide the crustal weaknesses that recent magmatic intrusions and Cenozoic volcanism are attributed to.\n\nThe rugged Pahoehoe and A'a' lava flows of the Zuni-Bandera eruptions (also called the Grants Lava Flows) filled a large basin, created by normal faulting associated with the Rio Grande Rift, between the high mesas of the Acoma Pueblo to the east, Mt. Taylor to the north, and the Zuni Mountain anticline to the northwest. Vents associated with these flows include Bandera Crater, El Calderon, and several other cinder cones; more than a dozen older cinder cones follow a roughly north-south distribution along the Chain of Craters west of the monument.\n\nSome of the oldest Douglas Fir (\"Pseudotsuga\") trees on earth, of the \"Pseudotsuga\" subspecies Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (\"Pseudotsuga menziesii subsp. glauca\"), can be found living in El Malpais Monument.\n\nThe area around El Malpais was used for resources, settlement, and travel by Oasisamerica cultures, Native Americans, and Spanish colonial and pioneer exploration. Archaeological sites remain in the park.\nIn the 1940s the Malpais lava field was one of the eight candidate sites considered by the Manhattan Project to test detonate the first atomic bomb, the Trinity nuclear test, which did occur to the south at White Sands Proving Ground. The Department of Defense did use the site as a bombing range to train pilots during World War II.\n\nAfter the war, the Bureau of Land Management became the administrator of the area. In 1987, President Reagan created El Malpais National Monument and designated it a unit of the National Park Service. It is jointly managed with the nearby El Morro National Monument.\n\nEl Malpais has many lava tube caves open to explore (unguided) with a free caving permit, available at NPS-staffed facilities. There are currently four caves accessible by permit: Junction and Xenolith caves in the El Caldron area, and Big Skylight and Giant Ice caves in the Big Tubes area. From December 2010 to June 2013, all caves were temporarily closed to recreational use to protect bats from the spread of White Nose Syndrome (WNS) until a permitting process, including visitor screening for WNS, could be implemented.\n\nA nearby scenic overlook at Sandstone Bluffs offers spectacular panoramic views over the monument's lava flows.\n\nThe U.S. National Park Service protects, manages, and interprets El Malpais National Monument. They operate two Visitor Centers with natural history displays, literature, maps, and staff with helpful information. El Malpais Visitor Center (formerly The Northwest New Mexico Visitor Center) is just south of Exit 85 off I-40 in Grants, New Mexico. The El Malpais Information Center is 28 miles down Highway 53 south of I-40 Exit 81.\n\nThe adjacent El Malpais National Conservation Area is protected and managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. They staff the El Malpais National Conservation Area Ranger Station 8 miles down State Highway 117 south of I-40 Exit 89.\n\nThe Cibola National Forest conserves large natural areas, wildlife, and habitats in the surrounding region as well.\n\nThe second portion of the book \"Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley takes place on the \"savage reservation\", which is located on land encompassing the parks area.\n\nThe \"malpais\" is the setting for a western story, \"Flint\" (November, 1960) by Louis L'Amour. Flint is a successful business man who thinks he is dying of cancer and returns to a hidden campsite within the \"malpais\" he had learned of in his youth.\n\nA scene in Cormac McCarthy's novel \"Blood Meridian\" takes place on the malpais.\n\n"}

In addition, fashion capitals usually have a broad mix of business, artistic, entertainment, cultural and leisure activities and are internationally recognised for having a unique and strong identity. It has also been noted that the status of a fashion capital has become increasingly linked to a city's domestic and international profile. Fashion capitals are also likely be part of a wider design scene, with design schools, fashion magazines and a local market of affluent consumers.\n\nSince the 16th century, Milan has been regarded as the Fashion Capital of the World. Nowadays, often the term fashion capital is used to describe the cities that hold fashion weeks, most prominently Milan, Paris, London and New York, to showcase their industry. Also various other cities host notable fashion events and are influential in global fashion.\n\nHistorically, several cities have been, in turn, fashion capitals. During the Renaissance era, different city-states in what would become modern-day Italy were Europe's main trendsetters, due to the cultural power they exerted in that period of time; this includes cities such as Florence, Milan, Rome, Naples, Genoa, and Venice.\n\nProgressing into the late-16th century, with influence of the English Royal Court, London became a major city in European fashion. Similarly, due to the power of Spain at the period, the Spanish court started to influence fashion, making it a major centre. In the 17th century, as the Renaissance started to fade away, with the power of the French court under Louis XIV, Paris established itself as Europe's main fashion centre.\n\nDuring the 19th century, with the powerful British Empire and a young Queen Victoria on the throne (from 1837), London once again became a major fashion leader. However, it continued to look to Paris for stylistic inspiration, and the British 'father of haute couture' Charles Frederick Worth relocated to Paris in 1846 to perfect and then commercialise his craft, also holding the first fashion shows and launching the concept of fashion labels there.\n\nDuring the Golden Twenties, Berlin was considered the vanguard fashion capital.\n\nThroughout the 20th century – but particularly after World War II – New York City rose in stature as a fashion capital, challenging the dominance of Paris with a different approach, especially in its development and popularisation of sportswear as fashion during the 1940s and '50s.\n\nDuring the 1950s Italy rose in prominence again. Florence re-emerged as a leading city in fashion, although focus shifted to Milan from the 1970s on as leading design houses moved to the city. \nIn the 1980s, Tokyo claimed its place as a fashion capital with a new generation of avant-garde designers, including Issey Miyake or Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons gaining worldwide attention, even if the fashion show were all in Paris. The fashion was radically different in both its use of textiles and in the way designers cut and draped.\n\nMore recently, new fashion hubs have emerged worldwide, and the old order has faced challenges from all corners of the globe, including Africa, Australasia and South America. Since 2007, Berlin has again been highlighted as an increasingly important centre for global fashion trends.\n\nA 2011 issue of \"Fashion Theory: Journal of Dress, Body and Culture\" explored the move away from the traditional dominance of five key cities (London, Milan, New York, Paris, Tokyo), with co-editor Lise Skov suggesting what she described as a \"poly-centric\" fashion industry developing in the 21st century. \nAn annual ranking of the leading fashion capitals is produced by Global Language Monitor, a US-based company that tracks trends through language use worldwide. The 2018 top-sixty three fashion capitals, according to its rankings, are listed below.\n\nThe current 2017 rankings now include 63 fashion capitals. There are three new fashion capitals from West Africa: Accra, Ghana; Dakar, Senegal; and Lagos, Nigeria. There is one new fashion capital from East Asia: Kuala Lumpur. There is one new fashion capital from the Middle East: Beirut, Lebanon. Before the various insurgencies in the region, Beirut was known as the Paris of the Middle East. There are two new fashion capitals from North America: Portland, Oregon known for its ‘weird’ culture, much like Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio known in the fashion world as the manufacturing headquarters of Henri Bendel, Victoria’s Secret, the Bath & Body Works, Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F), and others.\n\nNo. 3 Barcelona — Moving into Big Four Territory is Big News by definition.\n\nNo. 4 Milano — Reclaiming its Big Four status; hmm, perhaps all that re-thinking and revamping just might be having an impact (we’ll see in 2018).\n\nNo. 6 London — Had a great run earlier in the decade, but not so great lately (If you consider the No. 6 spot not so great).\n\nNo. 7 Amsterdam — Moving up 15 spots is quite a move.\n\nNo. 9 Vegas — Back in the Top Ten, more evidence that the Red Carpet experience does indeed have an impact.\n\nNo. 10 Dubai — More evidence that billions of dollars Do, indeed, have an impact.\n\nNo. 17 Seoul — Finally making the move in Asia, not No. 1, but a respectable No. 3 regionally.\n\nNo. 21 Washington, DC — A move into respectability!?\n\nNo. 28 Melbourne and No. 34 Sydney — Trading Places\n\nNo. 44 Portland, OR — A very nice debut.\n\nNo. 47 Kuala Lumpur — Another solid debut.\n\nNo. 46 Boston, No. 48 Miami, No.53 Chicago, No. 54 Houston, and No. 59 Toronto — All down by twenty spots, or more.\n\nNo. 63 Caracas — On Hiatus due to Insurrection.\n\n"}

{"id": "842701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=842701", "title": "Flash fiction", "text": "Flash fiction\n\nFlash fiction is a fictional work of extreme brevity that still offers character and plot development. Identified varieties, many of them defined by word count, include the , the 280-character story (also known as \"twitterature\"), the \"dribble\" (also known as the \"minisaga\"; 50 words), the \"drabble\" (also known as \"microfiction\"; 100 words), \"sudden fiction\" (750 words), flash fiction (1,000 words), nanotale, and \"micro-story\". \n\nSome commentators have suggested that flash fiction possesses a unique literary quality, in its ability to hint at or imply a larger story.\n\nFlash fiction has roots going back to prehistory, recorded at origin of writing, including fables and parables, notably \"Aesop's Fables\" in the west, and Panchatantra and Jataka tales in India. Later examples include the tales of Nasreddin, and Zen koans such as \"The Gateless Gate\".\n\nIn the United States, early forms of flash fiction can be found in the 19th century, notably in the figures of Walt Whitman, Ambrose Bierce, and Kate Chopin.\n\nIn the 1920s flash fiction was referred to as the \"short short story\" and was associated with \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine; and in the 1930s, collected in anthologies such as \"The American Short Short Story\". \n\nWilliam Somerset Maugham was a notable proponent, with his \"Cosmopolitans: Very Short Stories\" (1936) being an early collection. \n\nIn Japan, flash fiction was popularized in the post-war period particularly by .\n\nPractitioners have included Saadi of Shiraz (\"Gulistan of Sa'di\"), Bolesław Prus, Anton Chekhov, O. Henry, Franz Kafka, H.P. Lovecraft, Yasunari Kawabata, Ernest Hemingway, Julio Cortázar, Daniil Kharms, Arthur C. Clarke, Richard Brautigan, Ray Bradbury, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., Fredric Brown, John Cage, Philip K.

It is disputed whether (to win a bet), as alleged, he also wrote the flash fiction \"\".\n\nAlso notable are the 62 \"short-shorts\" which comprise \"Severance,\" the thematic collection by Robert Olen Butler in which each story describes the remaining 90 seconds of conscious awareness within human heads which have been decapitated.\n\nEnglish speaking writers well known for their published flash fiction include Lydia Davis, David Gaffney and Robert Scotellaro and online include Sherrie Flick, Bruce Holland Rogers, Steve Almond, Barbara Henning, Grant Faulkner, and Nancy Stohlman.\n\nSpanish-speaking literature has many authors of microstories, including Augusto Monterroso (\"El dinosaurio\") and Luis Felipe Lomelí (\"El Emigrante\"). Their microstories are some of the shortest ever written in that language. In Spain, authors of \"microrrelatos\" (very short fictions) have included Andrés Neuman, Ramón Gómez de la Serna, José Jiménez Lozano, Javier Tomeo, José María Merino, Juan José Millás, and Óscar Esquivias. In his collection \"La mitad del diablo\" (Páginas de Espuma, 2006), included the one-word story , which in its entirety reads: \"Yo\" (\"I\"). In Argentina, notable contemporary contributors to the genre have included Marco Denevi, Luisa Valenzuela, and Ana María Shua.\n\nThe Italian writer Italo Calvino consciously searched for a short narrative form, drawing inspiration from Argentine writers Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares and finding that Monterroso's was \"the most perfect he could find\"; \"El dinosaurio\", in turn, possibly inspired his \"The Dinosaurs\".\n\nIn France and Francophone countries, \"micronouvelles\" have been popularized by authors such as Jacques Fuentealba and Vincent Bastin.\n\nGerman-language authors of \"Kürzestgeschichten,\" influenced by brief narratives penned by Bertolt Brecht and Franz Kafka, have included Peter Bichsel, Heimito von Doderer, Günter Kunert, and Helmut Heißenbüttel.\n\nThe Arabic-speaking world has produced a number of micro-story authors, including the Nobel Prize-winning Egyptian author Naguib Mahfouz, whose book \"Echoes of an Autobiography\" is composed mainly of such stories. Other flash fiction writers in Arabic include Zakaria Tamer, Haidar Haidar, and Laila al-Othman.\n\nIn the Russian-speaking world the best known flash fiction author is Linor Goralik.\n\nIn the southwestern Indian state of Kerala is known for his many micro-stories in the Malayalam language.\n\nA number of print journals dedicate themselves to flash fiction. These include \"Flash: The International Short-Short Story Magazine\" and the \"Vestal Review\".\n\nAccess to the Internet has enhanced an awareness of flash fiction, with online journals being devoted entirely to the style. \"SmokeLong Quarterly\", founded by Dave Clapper in 2003, is \"dedicated to bringing the best flash fiction to the web ... whether written by widely published authors or those new to the craft.\" Other online flash fiction journals include \"wigleaf\", \"Flash Fiction Online\" and \"Flash Fiction Magazine\". \n\nA comprehensive list of online magazines accepting flash fiction.\n\nAuthor Paulo Coelho remarked that the \"democratization of communication offered by the Internet has made positive in-roads\" and directly influenced the style's popularity.

{"id": "238852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238852", "title": "Geas", "text": "Geas\n\nIn Irish, a geas (alternatives: geis, géis, deas; plural \"geasa\") is an idiosyncratic taboo, whether of obligation or prohibition, similar to being under a vow. The plural is also used to mean specifically a spell prohibiting some action, common in Irish folklore and mythology. It is this additional meaning of the plural which the article discusses.\n\nThe equivalent Scottish Gaelic word, also used in English, is \"geas\" (, plural \"geasan\").\n\nA \"geas\" can be compared with a curse or, paradoxically, a gift. If someone under a \"geas\" violates the associated taboo, the infractor will suffer dishonor or even death. On the other hand, the observing of one's \"geas\" is believed to bring power. Often it is women who place \"geasa\" upon men. In some cases the woman turns out to be a goddess or other sovereignty figure.\n\nThe \"geas\" is often a key device in hero tales, such as that of Cúchulainn in Irish mythology. Traditionally, the doom of heroes comes about due to their violation of their \"geas\", either by accident, or by having multiple \"geasa\" and then being placed in a position where they have no option but to violate one \"geas\" in order to maintain another. For instance, Cúchulainn has a \"geas\" to never eat dog meat, and he is also bound by a \"geas\" to eat any food offered to him by a woman. When a hag offers him dog meat, he has no way to emerge from the situation unscathed; this leads to his death.\n\nA beneficial \"geas\" might involve a prophecy that a person would die in a particular way; the particulars of their death in the vision might be so bizarre that the person could then avoid their fate for many years.\n\nThere is a considerable similarity between the Goidelic geasa and the Brythonic tynged. This is not surprising given the close origins of many of the variants of Celtic mythology.\n\nFor example, the Welsh hero Lleu Llaw Gyffes (in one version of his story) was destined to die neither \"during the day or night, nor indoors or outdoors, neither riding nor walking, not clothed and not naked, nor by any weapon lawfully made.\" He was safe until his wife, Blodeuwedd, learning of these foretold conditions, convinced him to show her how he could theoretically be stepping out of a river onto a riverbank sheltered by a roof and put one foot on a goat, and so on, thus enabling the conditions that allowed him to be killed.\n\nProhibitions and taboos similar to \"geasa\" are also found in more recent English literature, though they are not described as \"geasa\" in those texts. For example, in William Shakespeare's play \"Macbeth\", the title character believes he is safe because \"no man of woman born shall harm Macbeth\". However, his nemesis Macduff was \"from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd\" (i.e., born by Caesarean section), and was therefore not \"of woman born\".\n\nTerry Pratchett's novel \"Sourcery\" (1988) presents another example: the barbarian Nijel the Destroyer is under a geas that prevents him from dying until he does something brave, and thus he chooses to be an immortal coward.\n\nAnother example is the Witch-King of Angmar from Tolkien's Legendarium, who has a geas-like prophecy described by the Elven hero, Glorfindel: \"Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man shall he fall.\" In this the meaning is quite literal, for the Witch-king is eventually struck down by Eowyn, a shieldmaiden of Rohan, and thus not a man but a woman.\n\n"}
{"id": "20146636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20146636", "title": "Gentleman detective", "text": "Gentleman detective\n\nThe gentleman detective is a type of fictional character. He (or, less commonly, she) has long been a staple of crime fiction, particularly in detective novels and short stories set in Britain in the Golden Age. The heroes of these adventures are typically both gentlemen by conduct and also members of the British gentry. The literary heroes being in opposition to professional police force detectives from the working classes.\n\nGentlemen detectives include amateurs, private detectives and professional policemen. They are always well educated, frequently have unusual or eccentric hobbies, and are commonly found in their natural environment, an English country house. This archetype of British detective contrasts with the more \"hardboiled\" counterpart in American crime fiction.\n\nGentlemen detectives appeared early in modern detective fiction, which began in the late 19th century.\n\nC. Auguste Dupin, created by Edgar Allan Poe, is widely considered to be the first fictional detective in English literature. He appeared in three short stories written in the 1840s: \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841), \"The Mystery of Marie Rogêt\" (1842) and \"The Purloined Letter\" (1844).\n\nPoe created Dupin before the word \"detective\" had been coined, but began many common elements of detective fiction: Dupin shares some features with the later gentleman detective. He was \"…the first fictional detective of importance and the model for virtually every cerebral crime solver who followed.\" More specifically, Dorothy L. Sayers noted that \"Sherlock Holmes modelled himself to a large extent upon (Poe's) Dupin, substituting cocaine for candlelight, with accompaniments of shag and fiddle-playing.\" \n\nDupin is French, not English, but is probably a \"gentleman\". He comes from a once wealthy family but has been reduced \"by a variety of untoward events\" to more humble circumstances. He is entirely amateur and contents himself only with the basic necessities of life. He lives in Paris with his close friend, the anonymous narrator of the stories. Like the much later Lord Peter Wimsey (see below), Dupin is a bibliophile, and met his narrator friend while both were searching for \"the same rare and very remarkable volume\" in an obscure library. For hobbies, Dupin is \"fond\" of enigmas, conundrums, and hieroglyphics. Dupin also bears the French title \"Chevalier\", meaning that he is a knight in the Légion d'honneur.\n\nThe classic British gentleman detective appears soon after Poe's Dupin. A gentleman amateur is the ultimate hero of \"The Moonstone\" (1868), a famous epistolary novel widely considered the first true detective novel in English. Its author, Wilkie Collins was a lawyer, and a close friend of Charles Dickens. Collins also used gifted amateurs in his earlier mystery novel, \"The Woman in White\" (1859).\n\nIn \"The Moonstone\", Rachel Verinder is the only child of a rich, aristocratic widow. On her eighteenth birthday, she is bequeathed an enormous diamond; that night, this 'moonstone' is stolen from the country house of her mother, Lady Verinder. After local police are baffled, a Bow Street Runner called Sergeant Cuff is called in. Sergeant Cuff is honourable and skilful, but he is \"not\" a gentleman, and is unable to break Rachel's reticence about what is clearly an inside job.\n\nThe mystery is eventually solved by Franklin Blake, who is a gifted amateur—and definitely a member of the gentry. The social difference between Collins' two detectives is nicely shown by their relationships with the Verinder family: Sergeant Cuff becomes a great friend of Lady Verinder's steward (chief servant), whereas Franklin Blake eventually marries Rachel, her daughter.\n\nThe most famous of all fictional detectives, Sherlock Holmes, may also be considered a gentleman, at least by background. Holmes was the creation of Scottish author and physician Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He appeared in four novels and fifty-six short stories, all but four stories narrated by his associate, the notable Dr Watson. These works cover in fiction a period from around 1878 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. Both characters also appear in many pastiches.\n\nHolmes is a brilliant London-based and self-styled \"consulting detective\". In their debut (the 1887 novel, \"A Study in Scarlet\"), he tells Watson that this occupation is unique (which at that date it was). As a retired army doctor, Dr Watson is far closer to the stereotypic English gentleman than Holmes, yet has no social reservations about beginning his long association with the detective. In the best traditions of the gentry, Holmes proves to be physically brave, and competent with fists, sword and pistol. Like the earlier Dupin and the later Lord Peter Wimsey (see below), Holmes is also a competent cryptanalyst (for instance, The Dancing Men, 1903).\n\nConan Doyle never gave much background about Holmes' family, but his hero was apparently born in 1854 (estimated from His Last Bow, 1917). He also has an eccentric older brother, Mycroft Holmes, a senior public servant and member of the Diogenes Club. As further indirect evidence that Holmes is an educated gentleman, Conan Doyle indicates that Holmes is fluent in Latin (\"A Study in Scarlet\", 1887), and as the series continues his speech is replete with references to the Bible, Shakespeare, and even Goethe. Holmes had earlier attended university, where he began his detecting as an amateur (The Gloria Scott, 1893, and The Musgrave Ritual, 1893). A violinist himself, Holmes loves music (The Red-Headed League, 1890), sometimes to the point of eccentricity; in The Bruce-Partington Plans (1912), Watson reports that \"Holmes lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus.\"\n\nThe renowned crime writers of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction were mostly British and mostly women, including the four \"Queens of Crime\" (Margery Allingham, Agatha Christie, Ngaio Marsh and Dorothy L. Sayers). They all produced at least one gentleman detective. Their books featuring these characters are still generally in print.\n\n\nSeveral modern day fictional characters may be considered examples of gentlemen detectives. Like Alleyn but unlike earlier gifted amateurs such as Wimsey, Campion or Miss Marple, several modern \"gentleman detectives\" are professional policemen.\n\nAdam Dalgliesh, the creation of P. D. James, flourishes in the Metropolitan Police, despite being definitely gentry where such a background may be a disadvantage. Like the earlier Miss Marple, Dalgliesh is the child of an Anglican clergyman. He is somewhat of a recluse and, more eccentrically, a successful poet.\n\nInspector Morse, the subject of works by Colin Dexter, works in Oxford and is (or was) upwardly mobile: he won a scholarship to Oxford but subsequently failed. Like Alleyn and Wimsey, Morse served in the British army before joining the police, but unlike them, he served not as a commissioned officer in a prestigious regiment but as a non-commissioned officer in the Royal Military Police. Morse's snobbery is intellectual rather than a question of breeding or social advantage.\n\nDetective Inspector Lynley is another truly aristocratic member of the Police, being an Earl. Much of the plot of the novels by Elizabeth George revolve around his working relationship with Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, who is of lower-class origins. Both show greater loyalty to each other than to official regulations and accepted attitudes to their relative stations, and both are capable of self-sacrificing actions of \"noblesse oblige\".\n\nCarmen Isabella Sandiego, the \"World's Greatest Thief\", was originally ACME Crimenet's most intelligent and distinguished \"gentleman detective\" with a flawless record in solved cases. She got so bored, she changed careers as a \"gentleman thief\" and became spymaster and CEO of V.I.L.E., all just for the challenge.\n\nProfessor Layton from the video game series named after him. He is a professor of archaeology who solves various puzzles with his young apprentice Luke Triton.\n\nDetective Inspector Alexandra \"Alex\" Drake (née Price), the well-bred, posh protagonist of \"Ashes to Ashes\" (2007-2009, mentioned in \"Life on Mars\" in 2006). DI Drake, the orphaned daughter of a solicitor and barrister, was reared from adolescence by her parents' associate after she witnessed their violent deaths and narrowly avoiding being killed with them. She attended good schools and studied psychology before joining the Metropolitan Police and fast-tracking up the ranks. A gunshot to her head in 2007 sends her back in time to 1981, three months before her parents' murders, and places her in the company of comparatively Neanderthal detectives who had transplanted themselves from the North a year earlier.\n\nDetective Sergeant Makepeace, Lady Harriet \"Harry\" Makepeace, one of the two eponymous characters of \"Dempsey and Makepeace\" (1985-1988).

Prostitution has been described as \"the world's oldest profession,\" and despite consistent attempts at regulation, it continues nearly unchanged.\n\nThe Ancient Near East was home to many shrines, temples or \"houses of heaven,\" which were dedicated to various deities. These shrines and temples were documented by the Greek historian Herodotus in \"The Histories\", where sacred prostitution was a common practice. Sumerian records dating back to ca. 2400 BCE are the earliest recorded mention of prostitution as an occupation. These describe a temple-brothel operated by Sumerian priests in the city of Uruk. This \"kakum\" or temple was dedicated to the goddess Ishtar and was the home to three grades of women. The first grade of women were only permitted to perform sexual rituals in the temple, the second group had access to the grounds and catered to visitors, and the third and lowest class lived on the temple grounds. The third class was also free to find customers in the streets.\n\nDuring the region of Canaan, a significant portion of temple prostitutes were male. This was also widely practiced in Sardinia and in some of the Phoenician cultures, usually in honor of the goddess Ashtart. Presumably under the influence of the Phoenicians, this practice was developed in other ports of the Mediterranean Sea, such as Erice (Sicily), Locri Epizephiri, Croton, Rossano Vaglio and Sicca Veneria. Other hypotheses include Asia Minor, Lydia, Syria and the Etruscans.\n\nIn later years sacred prostitution and similar classifications for females were known to have existed in Greece, Rome, India, China, and Japan. Such practices came to an end when the emperor Constantine in the fourth century AD destroyed the goddess temples and replaced the religious practices with Christianity.\n\nProstitution was commonplace in ancient Israel. There are a number of references to prostitution in the Hebrew Bible. The Biblical story of Judah and Tamar () provides a depiction of prostitution being practiced in that time period. In this story the prostitute waits at the side of a highway where she waits for travelers. She covers her face in order to identify herself as a prostitute. Instead of being paid in money she asks for a kid goat. This would have been the equivalent of a high price, showing that only the wealthy owner of numerous herds could have afforded to pay for a single sexual encounter. Under this system if the traveller does not have his cattle with him he must give valuables to the woman as a deposit until a kid goat is delivered to her. The woman in the story was not a legitimate prostitute but actually was Judah's widowed daughter-in-law, who sought to trick Judah into impregnating her. However, since she succeeded in impersonating a prostitute her conduct can be assumed to accurately represent the behaviour of a prostitute in society during that time period.\n\nIn a later Biblical story, found in the Book of Joshua, a prostitute in Jericho named Rahab assisted Israelite spies by providing them with information regarding the current socio-cultural and military situation. Rahab was knowledgeable in these matters because of her popularity with the high-ranking nobles. The Israelite spies, in return for this information, promised to save her and her family during the planned military invasion, only if she kept the details of her contact with them a secret. She would leave a sign on her residence that indicated to the advancing soldiers not to attack the people within. When the people of Israel conquered Canaan, she converted to Judaism and married a prominent member of the people.\n\nIn the Book of Revelation, the Whore of Babylon is named \"Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and Abominations of the Earth\". However the word \"whore\" could also be translated as \"Idolatress\". The first Babylonian prostitute was in a place called Hinchinopolises, which arose from the appraised Hinchin family. At the time Hinchinapolis was the center of attraction for all travelers who came to rest in the company of the family's women, who perfected the art of satisfaction. Some ancient scrolls could tell us that the meaning of Hinchin came from the Hebrew \"Hinam\", meaning free, because the males of the family would offer themselves for free.\n\nAmong the Aztecs, the Cihuacalli was the name given to the controlled buildings where prostitution was permitted by political and religious authorities. Cihuacalli is a Nahuatl word which means House of Women. The Cihuacalli was a closed compound with rooms, all looking over a central patio. At the center of the patio was a statue of Tlazolteotl, the goddess of purification, steam baths, midwives, filth and a patroness of adulterers. Religious authorities believed women should work as prostitutes, if they wish, only at such premises guarded by Tlazolteotl. It was believed that Tlazolteotl had the power to incite sexual activity, while cleansing the spirit of such acts. Bernal Díaz described numerous male prostitutes among the Aztecs, as well as unmarried temple priests engaging in sodomy.\n\nInca prostitutes were segregated from other people and lived under the supervision of a government agent.\n\nIn ancient Greece, both women and boys engaged in prostitution. The Greek word for prostitute is \"porne\" (Gr: πόρνη), derived from the verb \"pernemi\" (to sell). The English word \"pornography\", and its corollaries in other languages, are directly derivative of the Greek word \"pornē\" (Gr: πόρνη). Female prostitutes could be independent and sometimes influential women. They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek \"hetaera\" and the Japanese \"oiran\", complex figures that are perhaps in an intermediate position between prostitution and courtisanerie. (See also the Indian tawaif.) Some prostitutes in ancient Greece, such as Lais were as famous for their company as their beauty, and some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services.\n\nSolon instituted the first of Athens' brothels (\"oik'iskoi\") in the sixth century BC, and with the earnings of this business he built a temple dedicated to Aphrodite Pandemos, goddess of sexual pleasure. Procuring, however, was severely forbidden. In Cyprus (Paphus) and in Corinth, a type of religious prostitution was practiced where the temple counted more than a thousand prostitutes (\"hierodules\", Gr: ιερόδουλες), according to Strabo.\n\nEach specialized category had its proper name, so there were the \"chamaitypa'i\", working outdoor (lie-down), the \"perepatetikes\" who met their customers while walking (and then worked in their houses), and the \"gephyrides\", who worked near the bridges. In the fifth century, Ateneo informs us that the price was 1 \"obole\", a sixth of a drachma and the equivalent of an ordinary worker's day salary. The rare pictures describe that sex was performed on beds with covers and pillows, while triclinia usually didn't have these accessories.\n\nMale prostitution was also common in Greece. Adolescent boys usually practiced it, a reflection of the pederastic custom of the time. Slave boys worked the male brothels in Athens, while free boys who sold their favours risked losing their political rights as adults.\n\nProstitution in ancient Rome was legal, public and widespread. Even Roman men of the highest social status were free to engage prostitutes of either sex without incurring moral disapproval, as long as they demonstrated self-control and moderation in the frequency and enjoyment of sex. Latin literature also often refers to prostitutes. Real-world practices are documented by provisions of Roman law that regulate prostitution. Inscriptions, especially graffiti from Pompeii, uncover the practice of prostitution in Ancient Rome. Some large brothels in the fourth century, when Rome was becoming Christianized, seem to have been counted as tourist attractions and were possibly state-owned. Prostitutes played a role in several Roman religious observances, mainly in the month of April, over which the love and fertility goddess Venus presided. While prostitution was so widely accepted, prostitutes were often considered shameful. Most were slaves or former slaves, or if free by birth relegated to the \"infames\", people lacking in social standing and deprived of the protections that most citizens under Roman law received. Prostitution thus reflects the ambivalent attitudes of Romans toward pleasure and sexuality.\n\nA registered prostitute was called a meretrix while the unregistered one fell under the broad category \"prostibulae\". There were some similarities between the Ancient Roman and Greek system, but as the Empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign slaves, captured, purchased or raised for the purpose of prostitution. This was sometimes done by large-scale \"prostitute farmers\" where abandoned children were raised, and almost always raised to become prostitutes. Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a male aristocrat.\n\nScholars have studied the history of prostitution in India from ancient times to the present.\n\nA tawaif was a courtesan who catered to the nobility of South Asia, particularly during the era of the Mughal Empire. These courtesans would dance, sing, recite poetry and entertain their suitors at mehfils. Like the geisha tradition in Japan, their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests. While sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. The most popular or highest-class tawaifs could often pick and choose between the best of their suitors. They contributed to music, dance, theatre, film and the Urdu literary tradition.\n\nThe term devadasi originally described a Hindu religious practice in which girls were married and dedicated to a deity (deva or devi). They were in charge of taking care of the temple, performing rituals they learned and practicing Bharatanatyam and other classical Indian arts traditions. This status allowed them to enjoy a high social status. The popularity of devadasis seems to have reached its pinnacle around the 10th and 11th centuries. The rise and fall in the status of devadasis can be seen to be running parallel to the rise and fall of Hindu temples. Due to the destruction of temples by Islamic invaders, the status of the temples fell very quickly in North India and slowly in South India. As the temples became poorer and lost their patron kings, and in some cases were destroyed, the devadasis were forced into a life of poverty and prostitution.\n\nDuring the British East India Company's rule in India in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was initially fairly common for British soldiers to engage in inter-ethnic prostitution in India, where they would frequently visit local Indian \"nautch\" dancers. As British females began arriving in British India in large numbers from the early to mid-19th century, it became increasingly uncommon for British soldiers to visit Indian prostitutes, and miscegenation was despised altogether after the events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n\nIn the seventh century, the prophet Muhammad declared that prostitution is forbidden. In Islam, prostitution is considered a sin, and Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari is attributed with saying, \"Allah's Apostle forbade taking the price of a dog, money earned by prostitution and the earnings of a soothsayer.\" () However, sexual slavery was not considered prostitution and was very common during the Arab slave trade during the Middle Ages and early modern period. Women and girls from the Caucasus, Africa, Central Asia and Europe were captured and served as concubines in the harems of the Arab World. Ibn Battuta said several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.\n\nAccording to Shia Muslims, the prophet Muhammad sanctioned fixed-term marriage, called \"muta'a\" in Iraq and \"sigheh\" in Iran, which according to some Western writers, has allegedly been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden. Sunni Muslims, who make up the majority of Muslims worldwide, believe the practice of nikah mut‘ah was revoked and ultimately forbidden by second Sunni caliph, Umar. However, Sunnis have fixed-term marriages, such as nikah urfi, nikah Misyar, and nikah halala. Fundamentalist Sunnis called for sexual jihad. Shias deem all sexual relations outside of proper marriage (the only being nikah or nikah mutah) as illegal, forbidden and against the sunnah. Like the Shia, Sunnis regard prostitution as sinful and forbidden.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, Portuguese visitors and their South Asian (and sometimes African) crew members often engaged in slavery in Japan, where they brought or captured young Japanese women and girls, who were either used as sexual slaves on their ships or taken to Macau and other Portuguese colonies in Southeast Asia, the Americas and India. For example, in Goa, a Portuguese colony in India, there was a community of Japanese slaves and traders during the late 16th and 17th centuries. Later European East India companies, including those of the Dutch and British, also engaged in prostitution in Japan.\n\nProstitution in China was due to a weak familial economy among the rural families of the country. Although China was a nation of wealth, the poverty stricken families were due to the over population of rural areas. These lives of borderline starvation drove many women out of the rural countryside to the port side cities of China. Many of the women who took part in the prostitution of China were either sold into the industry or willingly joined. Due to their lack of economic stability, parents were unable to feed all the mouths of the house and often sold their daughters into the industry. The popularity of this industry stemmed from the over population in rural villages, and an overall life of poverty for the majority of Chinese families. However, the increase of the colonial powers' presence in China added to the demand for these ladies of the night.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, prostitution was mostly prevalent in Singapore, due to its active ports. Certain districts of Singapore were dedicated brothel districts sanctioned by the colonial governments. As colonial powers entered the Asian countries, there was an increase in number of sailors at ports. Merchant ships carried large crews of men, who lacked the company of women for days on end. As these ships docked in Asian ports, like Singapore, they were drawn to the market of prostitution. This higher demand for the company of a woman created the need for these brothel districts.\n\nFrom the 15th century, Chinese, Korean and other Far Eastern visitors began frequenting brothels in Japan. This practice continued among visitors from the Western Regions, mainly European traders, beginning with the Portuguese in the 16th century who often came with their South Asian \"lascar\" crew, along with African crewmembers in some cases. In the 16th century, the local Japanese people initially assumed that the Portuguese were from \"Tenjiku\" (\"Heavenly Abode\"), the Japanese name for the Indian subcontinent due to its importance as the birthplace of Buddhism, and that Christianity was a new Indian faith. These mistaken assumptions were due to the Indian city of Goa being a central base for the Portuguese East India Company and also due to a significant portion of the crew on Portuguese ships being Indian Christians.\n\nIn the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of Kyoto, Edo and Osaka, Japan. Oiran were courtesans in Japan during the Edo period. The oiran were considered a type of also known as a \"woman of pleasure\" or prostitute. Among the oiran, the tayū (太夫) was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their clients, oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and education was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure districts. Their art and fashions often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded oiran was in 1761.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the problem of regulating prostitution according to modern European models was widely debated in Japan.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages prostitution was commonly found in urban contexts. Although all forms of sexual activity outside of marriage were regarded as sinful by the Roman Catholic Church, prostitution was tolerated because it helped prevent the greater evils of rape, sodomy and masturbation. Augustine of Hippo is quoted saying, \"if you expel prostitution from society, you will unsettle everything on account of lusts.\" The general tolerance of prostitution was for the most part reluctant, and many people from the church urged prostitutes to reform.\n\nAfter the decline of organized prostitution of the Roman empire, many prostitutes were slaves. However, religious campaigns against slavery and the growing marketisation of the economy turned prostitution back into a business. By the High Middle Ages it was common to find town governments ruling that prostitutes were not to ply their trade within the town walls, but they were tolerated outside, only because these areas were beyond the jurisdiction of the authorities. In many areas of France and Germany town governments came to set aside certain streets as areas where prostitution could be tolerated. In London the brothels of Southwark were owned by the Bishop of Winchester. After this, it became common in the major towns and cities of Southern Europe to establish civic brothels. This allowed the government to outlaw any prostitution taking place outside these brothels. In much of Northern Europe a more tolerant attitude could be found towards prostitution. Prostitutes also found a fruitful market in the Crusades.\nBy the end of the 15th century attitudes began to harden against prostitution. An outbreak of syphilis in Naples during 1494, which later swept across Europe, may have originated from the Colombian Exchange. The prevalence of other sexually transmitted diseases during the earlier 16th century may have caused this change in attitude. By the early 16th century the association between prostitutes, plague and contagion emerged, causing brothels and prostitution to be outlawed by secular authority. Furthermore, outlawing brothels and prostitution was used to \"strengthen the criminal law\" system of the 16th-century secular rulers. Canon law defined a prostitute as \"a promiscuous woman, regardless of financial elements.\" The prostitute was considered a \"whore … who [was] available for the lust of many men,\" and was most closely associated with promiscuity.\n\nThe Church's stance on prostitution was three-fold. It included the \"acceptance of prostitution as an inevitable social fact, condemnation of those profiting from this commerce, and encouragement for the prostitute to repent. The Church was forced to recognize its inability to remove prostitution from the worldly society, and in the 14th century \"began to tolerate prostitution as a lesser evil.\" However, prostitutes were excluded from the Church as long as they continued with their lifestyle. Around the 12th century, the idea of prostitute saints took hold, with Mary Magdalene being one of the most popular saints of the era. The Church used Mary Magdalene's biblical history of being a reformed harlot to encourage prostitutes to repent and mend their ways. Simultaneously, religious houses were established with the purpose of providing asylum and encouraging the reformation of prostitution. Magdalene Homes were particularly popular and peaked in the early 14th century. Over the course of the Middle Ages, popes and religious communities made various attempts to remove prostitution or reform prostitutes with varying success.\n\nWith the advent of the Protestant Reformation, numbers of Southern German towns closed their brothels in an attempt to eradicate prostitution. In some periods prostitutes had to distinguish themselves from other with particular signs. They sometimes wore very short hair or no hair at all, and sometimes they wore veils in societies where other women did not wear them. Ancient codes regulated the crime of a prostitute that dissimulated her profession.\n\nAccording to Dervish Ismail Agha, in the \"Dellâkname-i Dilküşâ\", the Ottoman archives, in the Turkish baths, the masseurs were traditionally young men who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. They also were as sex workers. The Ottoman texts describe who they were, their prices, how many times they could bring their customers to orgasm and the details of their sexual practices.\n\nIn the 18th century, presumably in Venice, prostitutes started using condoms made with catgut or cow bowel.\n\nIn America, prostitution was seen as a \"necessary evil\" that aided in marital fidelity, especially as a system that would allow men to obtain sex when their wives did not desire it. D'Emilio and Freedman document that prostitution was not a crime in the early part of the 19th century, and thus brothels (or bawdy houses) were tolerated in American cities and the laws against individual prostitutes were enforced only occasionally.\n\nIn the 1830s, prostitution was becoming more visible in American cities, and with the professionalization of police forces, visible prostitutes such as streetwalkers risked arrest. But D'Emilio and Freedman note that raids on brothels were comparatively rare, and prostitution was tolerated in mining towns, cattle towns, and urban centers in the American east. In 1870, prostitution was legalized and regulated in the city of St. Louis Missouri. Prostitutes were licensed by public health officials, and were required to maintain weekly inspections for sexually transmitted diseases. However, due to protests and demonstrations organized by women and members of the clergy, Missouri legislators repealed the legislation allowing regulated prostitution.\n\nThe Page Act of 1875 was passed by the US Congress and forbid any importation of women for the purpose of prostitution. The national move to criminalize prostitution was led by Protestant middle class men and women who participated in the revivalism movement of the 19th century. \n\nMany of the women who posed in 19th- and early-20th-century vintage erotica were prostitutes. The most famous were the New Orleans women who posed for E. J. Bellocq. In the 19th century legalized prostitution became a public controversy as France and then the United Kingdom passed the Contagious Diseases Acts. This legislation mandated pelvic examinations for suspected prostitutes. It applied not only to the United Kingdom and France, but also to their overseas colonies. Many early feminists fought to repeal these laws, either on the grounds that prostitution should be illegal and therefore not government regulated or because it forced degrading medical examinations upon women. A similar situation existed in the Russian Empire. This included prostitutes operating out of government-sanctioned brothels given yellow internal passports signifying their status and were subjected to weekly physical exams. Leo Tolstoy's novel \"Resurrection\" describes legal prostitution in 19th-century Russia.\n\nDuring the 19th century the British in India began to adopt the policy of social segregation, but they continued to keep their brothels full of Indian women. In the 19th and early 20th centuries there was a network of Chinese and Japanese prostitutes being trafficked across Asia, in countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Singapore and British India, in what was then known as the \"Yellow Slave Traffic.\" There was also a network of European prostitutes being trafficked to India, Ceylon, Singapore, China and Japan around the same time, this known as the \"White Slave Traffic.\" The most common destination for European prostitutes in Asia were the British colonies of India and Ceylon, where hundreds of women and girls from continental Europe and Japan serviced British soldiers.\n\nThe houses of prostitution found in every mining camp worldwide were famous, especially in the 19th century when long distance imports of prostitutes became common. Entrepreneurs set up shops and businesses to cater to the miners, and brothels were largely tolerated in mining towns. Prostitution in the American West was a growth industry that attracted sex workers from around the globe where they were pulled in by the money, despite the harsh and dangerous working conditions and low prestige. Chinese women were frequently sold by their families and taken to the camps as prostitutes, and were often forced to send their earnings back to the family in China. In Virginia City, Nevada, a prostitute, Julia Bulette, was one of the few who achieved \"respectable\" status. She nursed victims of an influenza epidemic, earning her acceptance in the community and the support of the sheriff. The townspeople were shocked when she was murdered in 1867 and they honoured her with a lavish funeral and hanging of her assailant.\n\nUntil the 1890s, madams predominately ran the businesses, after which male pimps took over. This led to the generally declined treatment of women. It was not uncommon for brothels in Western towns to operate openly, without the stigma that was beginning to emerge in East Coast cities as a result of anti-prostitution activism. Gambling and prostitution were central to life in these western towns, and only later, as the female population increased, reformers moved in and other civilizing influences arrived, did prostitution become less blatant and less common. After a decade or so the mining towns attracted respectable women who ran boarding houses, organized church societies, and worked as laundresses and seamstresses, all while striving for independent status.\n\nAustralia mining camps had a well-developed system of prostitution. City fathers sometimes tried to confine the practice to red light districts. The precise role prostitution played in various camps depended on the sex ratio in specific population groups of colonial society as well as racial attitudes toward non-whites. In the early 19th century British authorities decided it was best to have lower-class white, Asian, Middle Eastern and Aboriginal women service the prisoners and thereby keep peace while maintaining strong class lines that isolated British gentlemen and ladies from the lower elements. Prostitution was so profitable that it was easy to circumvent the legal boundaries. When Australians took control by 1900 they wanted a \"white Australia\" and tried to exclude or expel non-white women who might become prostitutes. However, feminist activists fought against Australia's discriminatory laws that led to varying levels of rights for women, races and classes. By 1939 new attitudes toward racial harmony began to surface. These were inspired by white Australians to rethink their racist policies and adopt more liberal residency laws that did not focus on sexual or racial issues.\n\nLatin American mining camps also had well-developed systems of prostitution. In Mexico the government tried to protect and idealize middle class women, but made little effort to protect prostitutes in the mining camps.\n\nIn 20th-century African mining camps prostitution followed the historical patterns developed in the 19th century. They added the theme of casual temporary marriages.\n\nDuring World War I, in colonial Philippines, US armed forces developed a prostitute management program called the \"American Plan\" which enabled the military to arrest any woman within five miles of a military cantonment. If found infected, a woman could be sentenced to a hospital or a farm colony until cured.\n\nBeginning in the 1910s and continuing in some places into the 1950s, the American Plan operated in the United States. Women were told to report to a health officer where they were coerced to submit to an invasive examination. Immigrants, minorities and the poor were primarily targeted.\n\nIn 1921, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children was signed. In this convention some nations declared reservations towards prostitution.\nThe leading theorists of communism opposed prostitution. Karl Marx thought of it as \"only a specific expression of the general prostitution of the laborer,\" and considered its abolition to be necessary to overcome capitalism. Friedrich Engels considered even marriage a form of prostitution, and Vladimir Lenin found sex work distasteful. Communist governments often took wide-ranging steps to repress prostitution immediately after obtaining power, although the practice always persisted. In the countries that remained nominally communist after the end of the Cold War, especially China, prostitution remained illegal but was nonetheless common. In many current or former communist countries the economic depression brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union led to an increase in prostitution.\n\nDuring World War II, Japanese soldiers engaged in forced prostitution during their invasions across East Asia and Southeast Asia. The term \"comfort women\" became a euphemism for the estimated 200,000 mostly Korean and Chinese women who were forced into prostitution in Japanese military brothels during the war.\n\nSex tourism emerged in the late 20th century as a controversial aspect of Western tourism and globalization. Sex tourism was typically undertaken internationally by tourists from wealthier countries. Author Nils Ringdal alleged that three out of four men between the ages of 20 and 50 who have visited Asia or Africa have paid for sex.\n\nA new legal approach to prostitution emerged at the end of the 20th century, termed \"the Swedish model\". This included the prohibition of buying, but not selling, of sexual services. This means that only the client commits a crime in engaging in paid sex, not the prostitute. Such laws were enacted in Sweden (1999), Norway (2009), Iceland (2009), Canada (2014), Northern Ireland (2015), France (2016), and the Republic of Ireland (2017), and are also being considered in other jurisdictions. These laws are an attempt to protect the worker and embrace the fallout of the sexual revolution, meaning sex will happen, and for it to happen safely and respectfully, there must be \"free-form\" regulation.\n\nIn the 21st century, Afghans revived a method of prostituting young boys, which is referred to as \"bacha bazi\".\n\nSince the break up of the Soviet Union thousands of eastern European women have become prostitutes in China, Western Europe, Israel and Turkey every year. There are tens of thousands of women from eastern Europe and Asia working as prostitutes in Dubai. Men from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates form a large proportion of the customers.\n\nIndia's devadasi girls are forced by their poor families to dedicate themselves to the Hindu goddess Renuka. The BBC wrote in 2007 that devadasis are \"sanctified prostitutes.\"\n\nThe United Kingdom introduced the Sexual Offences Act of 1956 which would partly be repealed and altered by the Sexual Offences Act 2003. While this law did not criminalise the act of prostitution itself, it did prohibit such activities as running a brothel and soliciting for paid sex.\n\nConcerns were voiced over white British adolescent girls being used as prostitutes by Pakistani immigrants in the 1960s. These girls were wanted by several police departments in the early 1960s and were described as \"good-looking and attractive, not of common appearance ... will almost certainly earn her living by prostitution and with Pakistanis.\"\n\nIn the United States prostitution was originally widely legal. Prostitution was made illegal in almost all states between 1910 and 1915 largely due to the influence of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, which was influential in the banning of drug use and was a major force in the prohibition of alcohol. In 1917 the prostitution district Storyville in New Orleans was closed down by the Federal government over local objections. In Deadwood, South Dakota prostitution, while technically illegal, was tolerated by local residents and officials for decades until the last madam was brought down by state and federal authorities for tax evasion in 1980. Prostitution remained legal in Alaska until 1953, and is still legal in some rural counties of Nevada, including areas outside of Las Vegas. For more, see Prostitution in Nevada.\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s many states increased the penalties for prostitution in cases where the prostitute is knowingly HIV-positive. These laws, often known as felony prostitution laws, require anyone arrested for prostitution to be tested for HIV. If the test comes back positive the suspect is informed that any future arrest for prostitution will be a felony instead of a misdemeanor. Penalties for felony prostitution vary in the states that have such laws, with maximum sentences of typically 10 to 15 years in prison. An episode of \"COPS\" which aired in the early 1990s detailed the impact of HIV/AIDS among prostitutes; this episode contributed to HIV/AIDS awareness.\n\n\n"}

It was created by producer/writer Carol Rosenstein and director Bruce Gowers of Together Again Video Productions (TAVP), both of whom are music video and television production veterans. The duo had produced and directed over 100 music videos for Warner Brothers Records (WBR) and took their idea of music videos for children to the record label. Warner Brothers funded the first video, “A Day at Old MacDonald’s Farm”. Shortly thereafter, a three way partnership between TAVP, WBR and View-Master Video was formed with TAVP being responsible for production and WBR and View-Master responsible for distribution to video and music stores, and toy stores respectively.\n\nThe home video series was launched with four Kidsongs Music Video Stories episodes at New York's Toy Fair on January 1, 1985. \"A Day at Old MacDonald's Farm” was one of those first four and has sold over 4 million copies and won the Vira Award. Each half-hour Music Video Stories episode features 10 to 15 songs, in a music video style production starring children. They sing and dance their way through well-known children's songs, nursery rhymes, and covers of pop hits from the '50s, '60s and '70s—all tied together by a simple story and theme.\n\nThe TAVP/WBR/View-Master Video (Viewmaster was acquired by Tyco in 1989–95) partnership produced 16 Kidsongs episodes of the Music Video Stories. In 1995, WBR and TAVP bought out Tyco's distribution rights and produced three more View-Master videos called \"Billy Biggle's Favorite Songs\", \"Country Sing-Along\", and \"Boppin' with the Biggles\" in 1994, and two KidVision videos called \"Let's Put on a Show\", \"Baby Animal Songs\", \"Four Season Songs\", & \"We're Going to the Dinosaurs\" in 1995 & 1996, as part of a new venture with another division of Warner Bros.--Warner Vision. In 1997, TAVP acquired all rights from WBR/Warner Vision and became the sole owner of all Kidsongs properties.\n\nLater in 1997, TAVP entered into a distribution/production agreement with Sony Wonder, which resulted in the production of four more titles called \"I Can Do It\", \"I Can Dance!\", \"Adventures in Biggleland: Billy's Birthday\", and \"Adventures in Biggleland: Meet the Biggles\". That agreement ended in July 1, 1998, and in 2002, distribution rights were licensed by Image Entertainment, who continues to distribute the videos.\n\n\nFrom December 3, 1985 to August 24, 1998, Kidsongs home video episodes encompassing 300 children's songs, nursery rhymes, and cover versions of pop hits from the '50s-'90s were produced, featuring a variety of subjects that are of interest to kids: animals, birthdays, the zoo, sports, summer camp, fantasy, vehicles, and general silliness. 14 have been certified platinum by the RIAA, with 5 of them having sold more than 2 million copies. As of now, the videos have sold over 19.5 million copies.\n\nThe following is a complete list of Kidsongs music video titles available on VHS:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nFeaturing these music videos:\n\nThe Kidsongs Television Show debuted on September 19, 1987, with 26 half-hour episodes for 30 minutes distributed by Orbis Entertainment. The half-hour, live action episodes featured the Kidsongs Kids running their own TV show in a top 8 countdown-style show, featuring music videos from the Kidsongs home video series. It ran on network affiliates, primarily on Saturday mornings. It garnered excellent ratings and ran for 2 years, before moving to the Disney Channel for another four years. It won the prestigious Excellence in Children's Programming Award from ACT. In 1987–88, it was called \"The Kidsongs TV Show\".\n\nIn 1994, a new version of the television series was developed by Rosenstein and produced in conjunction with Chicago public television station WTTW for 30 minutes and distributed by American Public Television to PBS stations nationally. Airing as part of the PBS Kids \"Ready to Learn\" block, \"The Kidsongs Television Show\" aired throughout the country and, by 1998, reached 89 percent of households. Many of the original Kidsongs videos were used in the public television series, along with new educational content and in-studio guests. The kids are joined by the adorable fantasy characters Billy and Ruby Biggle, and their magical friends from Biggleland. The Biggles help the children resolve their problems and concerns in a comforting, kind way. They address age-appropriate issues, such as not wanting to share, jealousy, friendship, telling the truth and patience.\n\nSeasons one through four of \"The Kidsongs Television Show\" totalled 80 episodes. It ran on Public Television for six years, winning critical acclaim. Currently, fifteen episodes of \"The Kidsongs Television Show\" are available on DVD, and also in its entirety on digital download through iTunes and Amazon Video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5662964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5662964", "title": "Lady's companion", "text": "Lady's companion\n\nA lady's companion was a woman of genteel birth who lived with a woman of rank or wealth as retainer. The term was in use in the United Kingdom from at least the 18th century to the mid-20th century but it is now archaic. The role was related to the position of lady-in-waiting, which by the 19th century was only applied to the female retainers of female members of the royal family. Ladies-in-waiting were usually women from the most privileged backgrounds who took the position for the prestige of associating with royalty, or for the enhanced marriage prospects available to those who spent time at court, but lady's companions usually took up their occupation because they needed to earn a living and have somewhere to live. A companion is not to be confused with lady's maid, a female personal attendant roughly equivalent to a \"gentleman's gentleman\" or valet.\n\nLike a governess, a lady's companion was not regarded as a servant, but neither was she really treated as an equal. Only women from a class background similar to or only a little below that of their employer would be considered for the position. Women took positions as companions if they had no other means of support, as until the late 19th century there were very few other ways in which an upper- or upper-middle-class woman could earn a living which did not result in a complete loss of her class status. (Employment as a governess, running a private girls' school and writing were virtually the only other such options; hence the formation of the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women in 1859.)\n\nThe companion's role was to spend her time with her employer, providing company and conversation, to help her to entertain guests and often to accompany her to social events. In return she would be given a room in the family's part of the house, rather than the servants' quarters; all of her meals would be provided, and she would eat with her employer; and she would be paid a small salary, which would be called an \"allowance\" – never \"wages\". She would not be expected to perform any domestic duties which her employer might not carry out herself, in other words little other than giving directions to servants, fancy sewing and pouring tea. Thus the role was not very different from that of an adult relation in respect of the lady of a household, except for the essential subservience resulting from financial dependency.\n\nLady's companions were employed because upper- and middle-class women spent most of their time at home. A lady's companion might be taken on by an unmarried woman living on her own, by a widow, or by an unmarried woman who was living with her father or another male relation but had lost her mother, and was too old to have a governess. In the latter case the companion would also act as a chaperone; at the time, it would not have been socially acceptable for a young lady to receive male visitors without either a male relation or an older lady present (a female servant would not have sufficed).\n\nThe occupation of lady's companion has been made obsolete in the United Kingdom and most other developed countries. This is primarily because upper-class women no longer primarily stay in the home, and also because of the many other employment opportunities afforded to modern women.\n\nThere are numerous lady's companions in the mysteries of Agatha Christie, e.g. \"After the Funeral\". In her novels dating before the Second World War, the companion is presented as a conventional feature of the life of the moneyed classes. The companions after the Second World War are generally elderly women who grew up in Victorian times without the expectation of having to provide for themselves, but who find themselves impoverished due to the decline of the fortunes of many once well-to-do families as a result of the Great Depression and the investment losses incurred during the War. At the same time, the women who employ them are often not so well off as they once were themselves, especially in net terms due to high rates of taxation. \n\nThis situation is complicated by the collapse in the supply of working-class servants due to changing labour market conditions and social attitudes, so that companions are increasingly asked to perform domestic duties which they find humiliating. Along with the growing keenness of young middle-class women to take advantage of the broadening range of options available to them to have a career, this degradation of the status of the companion represents the closure of the era of the lady's companion in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40662597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40662597", "title": "Media weight", "text": "Media weight\n\nMedia weight is a term used in advertising to refer to the size of the audience reached by an advertising campaign. Media weight is determined by the number and placement of advertisements in media such as television commercials, online ads, or billboards.\n\nMedia weight is usually expressed in the form of GRP’s (Gross rating Points), AOTS (Average opportunity to see) and reach of target audience. The main use of media weights is to monitor how well the goals of a communication plan are being reached. There are different ways to measure media weight.\n\nThe most important method in measuring media weight is analysis of past records. The analysis is done on basis of television, print and magazines reporting. Television spendings are reported as TAM rates and print as card rates. TV spendings can be analyzed on the basis of program genre, channel type, time duration and total airtime. The print rate analysis is done on the basis of color/monochrome, magazine, issue, placement of ad, month, and other variables.\n\nResearch carried out by John Philip Jones on the advertising of different brands in 23 countries found that the brands could be classified into two types: \"profitable\" brands and \"investor\" brands.\n\nThese are brands that are advertised less in proportion to market share are categorized as profitable brands. These are brands which may have advertised many times previously but at present are enjoying higher market share with less advertising.\n\nThese are brands that are advertised more in proportion to market share. These brands tend to be newly introduced brands, which have less impact on the audience and are in the growth phase of their product lifecycle (PLC) curve.\n\nColin McDonald’s study in 1971 proved that consumers switch to the product of two or more exposures. It can be observed that more advertising results in increased reach and hence in increased sales. \n\nHerbert E. Krugman talked about three results of exposure to advertising. The three levels are curiosity, recognition and decision. And after these three the rest are all reminders. So to increase sales, the audience must be exposed to an advertisement at least thrice.\n\nIn 1995, John Philip Jones talked about the shelf space model of recency in his book \"When Ads Work\". He found that ‘within a week, a single ad exposure was enough to produce a strong purchasing effect and that subsequent exposures within that week added very little'. The task for advertising is therefore to remind the audience about the product.\n\n"}
{"id": "1574427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1574427", "title": "Medical humanities", "text": "Medical humanities\n\nMedical humanities is an interdisciplinary field of medicine which includes the humanities (philosophy, ethics, history, literature and religion), social science ( psychology, sociology,anthropology, cultural studies, health geography) and the arts (literature, theater, film, and visual arts) and their application to medical education and practice. The core strengths of the medical humanities are the imaginative nonconformist qualities and practices. \n\nMedical humanities is mainly concerned with training medical practitioners. This contrasts with health humanities which more broadly links health and social care disciplines with the arts and humanities.\n\nMedical humanities can be defined as an interdisciplinary, and increasingly international endeavor that draws on the creative and intellectual strengths of diverse disciplines, including literature, art, creative writing, drama, film, music, philosophy, ethical decision making, anthropology, and history, in pursuit of medical educational goals. The humanistic sciences are relevant when multiple people’s perspectives on issues are compiled together to answer questions or even create questions. The arts can provide additional perspective to the sciences.\n\nCritical medical humanities is an approach which argues that the arts and humanities have more to offer to healthcare than simply improving medical education. It proposes that the arts and humanities offer different ways of thinking about human history, culture, behaviour and experience which can be used to dissect, critique and influence healthcare practices and priorities.\n\nMedical books, pictures, and diagrams help medical students build an appreciation for anything in the medical field from the human body to diseases.\n\nThe medical humanities can assist medical practitioners with viewing issues from more than one perspective, such as the visual arts and culture are supposed to do. Both patients and doctors/medical professionals deal with facing decision-making. Each person’s perspective of medical ethics is different from one another due to different cultures, religions, societies, and traditions. The humanities also assist and attempt to create a closer or more meaningful relationship between medical practitioners and their peers/patients. Ethics are perceived differently from person to person, so answering ethical questions requires the viewpoints of several different people who may have different opinions of what is right from wrong.\n\nThe first category is bioethics, which includes the morals of healthcare. As science and technology develop, so does healthcare and medicine, and there is discussion and debate in society and healthcare committees that go over the ethics of these certain situations that pertain to medical humanities. For example, one of these cases involves the practice of body enhancements in which the ethics of this practice are questioned due to the fact that bio-medical and technological practices are making changes to a person’s body to improve the body and/or its appearance.\n\nThe second category in ethics of the medical humanities is clinical ethics, which refers to the respect that healthcare professionals have for patients and families, and this helps develop a sort of professionalism, respectability, and expertise that healthcare professionals must use in respect to their patients. Another example in the ethics of the medical humanities is bias people and society have against others with disabilities, and how these disabilities correlate with success or what the disabled person is able to do. It is unethical to judge or assume the incapability of a disabled person because disabled people are able to find ways to become successful through modern technology and even through self-determination.\n\nVarious academic institutions offer courses of study in the ethics of medical humanities. These programs help their students learn professionalism in the medical field so that they may respectfully help their patients and do what it is right in any situation that may arise.\n\nFormerly called medicine in literature, literature and medicine is an interdisciplinary subfield of the medical humanities considered a \"dialogue rather than a merger\" between the literary and the medical. Literature and medicine is flourishing in undergraduate programs and in medical schools at all levels. The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine-Hershey was the first to introduced literature into a medical school curriculum when Joanne Trautmann (Banks), an English professor, was appointed to a position in literature there in 1972. The rationale for using literature and medicine in medical education is three-fold: reading the stories of patients and writing about their experiences gives doctors in training the tools they need to better understand their patients; discussing and reflecting on literature brings the medical practitioner's biases and assumptions into focus, heightening awareness; and reading literature requires critical thinking and empathetic awareness about moral issues in medicine.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3332274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3332274", "title": "Millenarianism in colonial societies", "text": "Millenarianism in colonial societies\n\nMillenarianism has been found through history among people who rally around often-apocalyptic religious prophecies that predict a return to power, the defeat of enemies, and/or the accumulation of wealth. These movements have been especially common among people living under colonialism or other forces that disrupt previous social arrangements.\n\nThe phrase \"millennialist movement\" has been used by scholars in anthropology and history to describe the common features of these religious phenomena when viewed as social movements, and has most often been used to describe the social movements that have taken place in colonized societies.\n\nChristianity itself can be seen as originating in a millenarian movement among Jewish people living under Roman rule, although its characteristics as a social movement quickly changed as it spread through the Roman Empire. The Book of Revelation also predicts a thousand-year reign of Jesus prior to the defeat of Satan. \n\nSome millenarian movements include:\n\n"}
{"id": "12084691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12084691", "title": "Mirror's Edge", "text": "Mirror's Edge\n\nMirror's Edge is a first-person action-adventure platform video game developed by EA DICE and published by Electronic Arts. The game was announced in July 2007, and was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in November 2008. A Microsoft Windows version was released on January 13, 2009. \"Mirror's Edge\" is powered by Unreal Engine 3, with the addition of a new lighting solution, developed by Illuminate Labs in association with DICE.\n\n\"Mirror's Edge\" is set in a quasi-futuristic dystopian society, in which a network of 'runners', including the main character, Faith Connors, act as couriers to transmit messages while evading government surveillance. In the style of a three-dimensional platform game, the player guides Faith over rooftops, across walls, through ventilation shafts, and otherwise within urban environments, negotiating obstacles using movements inspired by parkour. The game has a brightly colored, minimalist style and differs from most previous first-person perspective video games in allowing for a greater freedom of movement with regard to its 3D environment. This allows for a wider range of actions—such as sliding under barriers, tumbling, wall-running, and shimmying across ledges; in having no heads-up display; and in allowing a range of vision which incorporated the legs, arms, and torso of the character as frequently visible elements on-screen.\n\n\"Mirror's Edge\" has received positive reviews, with the PC version garnering a Metacritic aggregated score of 81. The game's uniqueness and its expansive environments have received praise, while criticism has centred on its weakness of plot, trial and error gameplay, and short length. The game won the Annual Interactive Achievement Award for Adventure Game of the Year. A featuring remixes of the final credits song \"Still Alive\" by Swedish singer Lisa Miskovsky was also released. A side-scroller mobile game, also titled \"Mirror's Edge\", was released for iPad on April 1, 2010, and for the iPhone on September 2, 2010. The mobile game was ported to Windows Phone on July 13, 2012, with an initial exclusivity period for owners of Nokia Lumia phones. A prequel, \"Mirror's Edge Catalyst\", was officially announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013 and released on June 7, 2016.\n\nIn \"Mirror's Edge\", the player controls the protagonist, Faith, from a first-person perspective as she is challenged to navigate across a gleaming city by jumping between rooftops, running across walls, and gaining access to buildings through ventilation shafts. This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the discipline of parkour. According to senior producer Owen O'Brien, \"Mirror's Edge\" aims to \"convey [...] strain and physical contact with the environment\", with the goal of allowing a freedom of movement previously unseen in the first-person genre. In order to achieve this, camera movement pays more attention to character movement. For example, as Faith's speed builds up while running, the rate at which the camera bobs up and down increases as well. When a roll is executed, the camera spins with the character. Faith's arms, legs, and torso are prominent and their visibility is used to convey movement and momentum. The character's arms pump and the length of her steps increase with her gait, and her legs cycle and arms flail during long jumps.\n\nIn gameplay, the character's momentum becomes an asset. The player must attempt to conserve it through fluidity of physical actions, encouraging the creation of chains of moves. If Faith does not have the momentum required to traverse an object, she will fall off or short of it. Controls are simplified by being context-sensitive; the \"upwards movement\" button will cause Faith to traverse an obstacle by passing over it (i.e., by jumping, vaulting, climbing, or grabbing set pieces like zip-lines) while the \"downwards movement\" button will cause her to perform other manoeuvres like sliding, rolling, or crouching. To assist the player in creating these chains of moves, the game employs a system called \"Runner Vision\", which emphasizes environmental pieces useful for progression. Certain pipes, ramps, and doors are highlighted in red as Faith approaches, allowing the player to instantly recognize paths and escape routes. Further along in the game, the number of these visual hints is reduced to only the end goal, and the player can opt to turn off this hint system entirely. It is also used to create puzzles in which the player must figure out how to combine the highlighted set pieces into a chain of moves in order to reach the target. Another means of assistance to the player is a system called \"Reaction Time\", a form of bullet time activated by the player, slowing down time and allowing the player to plan and time their next move without losing momentum or tactical advantage.\n\nThe player character can hold weapons, but O'Brien stressed that \"this is an action adventure. We're not positioning this as a shooter – the focus isn't on the gun, it's on the person.\" Gameplay in \"Mirror's Edge\" focuses on finding the best route through the game's environments while combat takes a secondary role. Completing the game without shooting a single enemy unlocks an achievement for the player. Consequently, guns may be obtained by disarming an enemy, but when the magazine is empty, it will need to be discarded. Additionally, carrying a weapon slows Faith down; the heavier the gun, the more it hinders her movement. This introduces an element of strategy in determining when to trade agility for short-term firepower.\n\nAlong with the campaign mode, \"Mirror's Edge\" features a time attack mode, where the player must try to complete one of a set of special maps in the shortest amount of time. Best times can be uploaded to online leaderboards, where players can also download ghosts of other players to compete against. The maps are unlocked by playing through the campaign mode. According to producer Tom Ferrer, the time trial portions of \"Mirror's Edge\" are \"bite-sized and short so you can grind them and play them and get faster and faster. It's not like playing an entire level.\"\n\nThe mobile phone port includes many parkour moves from the PC and console versions, however, the perspective is shifted from first person to third person. The game does not feature cutscenes, and the plot is explained with scrolling text in between levels. The iOS version has since been removed from the app store due to problems with the game on iOS 8.\n\n\"Mirror's Edge\" takes place in a 'utopian' city where life is comfortable and crime almost non-existent. But the city's state of bliss is the achievement of a domineering and totalitarian military regime which monitors all communication, controls the media, spies on its citizens and has policies which include the outright prohibition of smoking and alcohol. The City also operates show trials and runs on a sham democracy. Eighteen years before the events of the game, they had opened fire on a protest against their rule, killing many civilians.\n\nAs the story begins the mayoral elections are near and a new candidate, Robert Pope, is challenging the incumbent Mayor Callaghan on a platform of deregulation.\n\nAccording to senior producer Owen O'Brien, \"[Mirror's Edge] asks how much of your personal freedom are you willing to give up for a comfortable life. It's not one girl against this police-state dictatorship. It's more subtle than that.\"\n\nAmerican TV series \"Firefly\" and film spin-off \"Serenity\" were cited by O'Brien as inspirations. \"Our other theme is you can't force other people to live by your rules and your society, even if your society is better,\" he said. \"In Serenity The Operative actually says, 'This is not an evil empire. We just don't understand why you don't want to be part of our happy club.' Obviously they take it too far, and that's kind of what happens in our game as well.\"\n\nWriter Rhianna Pratchett has said that the game's story examined why citizens would accept a life in a society where their personal choices were very limited. It also looked at reasons people might have for attempting to live outside the system and what could result from this. The society portrayed in the game was somewhere between what George Orwell described as an 'anti-utopia' and a Nanny State.\n\nThe protagonist of \"Mirror's Edge\" is 24-year-old Faith Connors (voiced by Jules de Jongh), who has a distinctive tattoo around her right eye, imitated by the game's logo. Faith earns her living as a \"Runner\", a courier who carries physical communiqués around the city, her services retained by revolutionary groups who avoid communicating via highly monitored telephone and email channels. Faith's attitude towards the totalitarian government is rooted in her past; her parents were active in protest movements when she was young, campaigning to keep the city from shifting to the oppressive regime. Her mother was killed during the \"November riots\"—peaceful protests gone wrong—and Faith ran away from home when she was 16, living a thief's life on the city streets. Faith became a Runner after meeting Mercury (or Merc), a former Runner who now trains new hires, sources jobs for them, and provides them with intelligence and radio support while on the job. Other characters include Faith's sister, Kate Connors, an officer with the city police; Drake, another Runner-trainer; Faith's friends Celeste and Kreeg, another pair of Merc's Runners; and Jacknife, a former Runner.\n\nFaith, after completing a delivery to fellow Runner Celeste, learns that her sister Kate may be in trouble at Pope's office. When she arrives, she finds Kate standing beside Pope's body, insisting she has been framed for murder and requesting Faith to discover the cause. Faith finds a piece of paper with the name \"Icarus\" on it in Pope's hand. Kate refuses to flee with Faith, saying it would only make her look guilty, and is arrested. From a former Runner, Jacknife, Faith learns that Pope's head of security, former wrestler Travis \"Ropeburn\" Burfield, may be connected to Pope's murder. Faith meets Lt. Miller, at Kate's behest, narrowly avoiding arrest. At Ropeburn's office, she overhears him setting up a meeting at a new place downtown. At the meeting, Ropeburn discovers Faith's presence and attacks her, but Faith gains the upper hand and throws him off the roof. As he is hanging above a long drop, she tries to interrogate Ropeburn, but before he can reveal anything he is killed by an unknown assassin.\n\nLacking other leads, Faith investigates the security firm that has begun aiding the police force in their crackdown of Runners. She finds they are behind \"Project Icarus\", a program designed to train their forces in parkour style to oppose the Runners, giving them the ability to chase down and eliminate the Runners. Faith follows the trail of Ropeburn's killer to a boat in port; after chasing the unknown person, Faith discovers the assassin is actually Celeste, who is colluding with Project Icarus to keep herself safe, and Celeste warns Faith to consider the same. The arrival of the police allows Celeste to escape.\n\nWith Kate convicted for Pope's murder, Merc plans a way for Faith to ambush the police convoy transporting her to prison, and Faith helps to free Kate. She gives Kate her comms unit that she and Merc use and tells her that he will guide her back to his hideout. When Faith returns to the hideout, she finds it in ruins, with Merc dying and Kate recaptured. In his dying words, Merc tells Faith that Kate is now at the Shard, which contains Mayor Callaghan's office and the servers that run the city's surveillance systems. With Miller's help, Faith is able to enter the Mayor's private offices, and destroys the servers that will unlock the rooftop security door. She gains access to the roof, but Miller was also ambushed while in the security room, abruptly cutting off communications, leaving Miller's status unknown. On the roof, she finds Kate held at gunpoint by Jacknife. Jacknife reveals that he too is part of Project Icarus, and has been part of the plan all along to lure the Runners out of hiding. When Jacknife tries to take Kate onto a waiting helicopter, Faith jumps on before it can leave, knocking Jacknife out of the helicopter to fall to his death but also damaging the helicopter in the process. Faith helps Kate to escape safely from the falling helicopter.\n\nDuring the end credits, the media reports that Faith's actions have only served to intensify Project Icarus, and Faith and Kate are still wanted for Pope's murder. However, with the surveillance infrastructure damaged, the population is cautioned to avoid using electronic means of communications until their \"security\" is restored, with the location of Faith and Kate remaining unknown.\n\nIn 2007, DICE creative director Ben Cousins told GamesIndustry.biz that the studio was looking to create \"something fresh and interesting\", anticipating a need to diversify away from the successful \"Battlefield\" franchise the studio was known for.\n\nIn June 2007, \"Computer and Video Games\" magazine revealed that DICE was working on a game called \"Mirror's Edge\", which was expected to \"shake up the [first-person shooter] genre\". On July 10, 2007, \"Mirror's Edge\" was officially announced by Electronic Arts, and at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in February 2008, the first demonstration of gameplay was shown. A video featuring entirely in-game footage was released at the Sony PlayStation Day in London on May 6, 2008.\n\n\"Mirror's Edge\" has a distinct visual style, with the outdoor environments predominantly featuring white and distinctively lacking in green (for example, trees and foliage would appear completely white instead of in their natural colours), punctuated by deliberate use of strong primary colours. According to Senior Producer Owen O'Brien, the stylistic choice allows the player to focus on the Runner Vision guidance, as well as serving as a health meter; the colours become less saturated as Faith starts to take damage. Because development of \"Mirror's Edge\" began before DICE's own Frostbite was completed, the game uses Epic's Unreal Engine 3. A lighting system called \"Beast\" was developed for the Unreal Engine by Illuminate Labs in association with DICE. The new software would accentuate the different art style of \"Mirror's Edge\", by allowing for the reflection of colours as well as light. In order to address the issue of simulation sickness associated with the free movement of the camera in first-person view, a small reticle was placed in the centre of the screen. The reticle serves as an aiming and focal point, preventing dizziness in similar fashion to the dance technique called spotting. Aside from this reticle (which can be hidden by the player), no heads-up display exists in the game.\n\nThe demo for \"Mirror's Edge\", consisting of the game's prologue chapter, was released via the PlayStation Store on October 30, 2008, followed by the Xbox LIVE Marketplace on October 31. On November 7, 2008, DICE announced that \"Mirror's Edge\" had achieved gold status, and PS3 and Xbox 360 versions would be shipping to retailers on November 13. On January 16, 2009, a Microsoft Windows version of the game was released. The PC version features support for Nvidia's PhysX, adding detail and physics to glass, smoke and soft materials. The game includes the SecuROM v7.x (activation based) DRM software, unless bought from Steam.\n\nThe game was at the centre of EA's conflict with Edge Games, a California-based development studio. Edge Games is not related to \"Edge\" magazine beyond the licensing of its trademark. In September 2009, EA petitioned to have Edge Games' trademarks cancelled, alleging continued threats of legal action. Tim Langdell, president of Edge Games, responded by accusing EA of engaging Edge Games in settlement talks as a \"play for time\". Langdell's company claimed true legal ownership of the phrase \"Mirror's Edge\" among other variations of \"Edge\". After a court found that Edge Games' claims were \"suspect\", the company settled with EA and surrendered many of its trademarks.\n\nBuyers who pre-ordered \"Mirror's Edge\" at GameCrazy received a code that unlocked a time trial portion of the demo, as well as a \"Mirror's Edge\"-themed t-shirt. A time trial code was also included in GameStop preorders, along with a yellow \"Runner Bag\" resembling the messenger bags used in the game. Preorders from UK retailer Game included a \"Mirror's Edge\"-edition Fenchurch t-shirt. The game could also be bought through the Electronic Arts website, where a package deal with a red Timbuk2 messenger bag was available. The bag featured the game's logo on the outside, while the inside featured a portrait of Faith.\n\nDuring Comic-Con 2008, DICE announced it would create a limited-run comic book adaptation of the game together with DC Comics division WildStorm. The six-issue comic is drawn by Matthew Dow Smith and written by Rhianna Pratchett.\n\nIn May, the \"Mirror's Edge Original Videogame Score\" was released in online-only form. The album was composed by Swedish electronic musician Magnus Birgersson, also known as Solar Fields, who stated that \"the music should reflect the environment, the story, the gameplay and Faith's mood\" and that the soundtrack is a mixture of electronic and ambient music.\n\nOn October 7, 2008, EA announced the release of a remix album featuring the \"Mirror's Edge\" theme song \"Still Alive\" by musician Lisa Miskovsky. Contributing artists included Benny Benassi, Junkie XL, Paul van Dyk, Teddybears and Armand Van Helden. Although \"Still Alive\" is also the name of the closing credits song of 2007 game \"Portal\", the two tracks are unrelated. The album, titled \"Still Alive – the Remixes\", was released on November 11, 2008. The album was included free in the standard game in later releases for some platforms.\n\n\"Mirror's Edge\" has received mostly positive reviews, with score aggregator Metacritic reporting scores of 81/100 for the PC version and 79/100 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. \"Official Xbox Magazine\" gave the game 9.5 out of 10, praising its \"brilliant sense of motion and gameplay\". \"Play\" awarded it 9 out of 10, while GameTrailers.com gave it 8.3 out of 10. \"Computer and Video Games\" was also positive, calling it \"A brilliant and unique experience, even if the small shooting parts aren't quite up to scratch.\" IGN awarded the game 8.3 out of 10, calling it a \"thrilling and stylish venture\", but \"the first chapter of a franchise that's still finding its feet.\" GameSpot praised the immersive gameplay environments, but criticised the inconsistency of gameplay speed. Ian Bogost of Gamasutra commended the game for being unconventional, calling it \"a shooter that makes you hate to shoot\".\n\n\"Edge\" gave the game 5 out of 10, stating that the levels felt contrived and that there was no true freedom through the levels, merely multiple preordained paths. \"The Guardian\" noted the game's short length, and many reviews criticised the \"trial and error\" nature of the play. Despite giving the game a score of 8 out of 10, Eurogamer dismissed the storyline as rambling, adding that \"[\"Mirror's Edge\"] is going to divide audiences down the middle... Some will be able to overlook the gaping flaws, but others will never appreciate its moments of brilliance, and both positions are justifiable... \" Other issues raised were the stylistic choice of animated cutscenes, and the \"cramped\" feel of some of the levels.\n\nThe developers initially projected a total of three million copies of \"Mirror's Edge\" to be sold, but in February 2009, Electronic Arts reported sales of over one million. According to an October 2010 court document pertaining to the legal conflict between EA and Edge Games (see \"Mirror's Edge\": Development and release), \"Mirror's Edge\" has sold more than two million copies worldwide, with more than 750,000 of those copies having been sold in North America. The iPhone-compatible version of the game has sold more than 37,000 copies. In June 2013, the executive vice president of the EA Games revealed the game has sold \"about 2.5 million units\". \n\nOn December 4, 2008, EA announced the creation of seven all-new time trial maps for \"Mirror's Edge\", slated for release in January 2009. According to Owen O'Brien, Senior Producer for DICE, “The freedom of movement and control in first person has been the most popular aspect of \"Mirror's Edge\" so we decided to distill these down to their purest form for this map pack... We deliberately chose a more abstract aesthetic that is still within our distinctive art style and then focused on flow and gameplay to create an experience and challenge very different from the main game.” In January 2009, the release date was specified as January 29. The release was delayed until February 19, 2009, when the \"Time Trial Map Pack\" was made available as downloadable content for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. An eighth map is available exclusively for the PlayStation 3 version of the game.\n\nA side-scrolling browser game interpretation of \"Mirror's Edge\" titled \"Mirror's Edge 2D\" was released by Electronic Arts in conjunction with independent developer Borne Games. The game is similar to and uses the modified engine of Borne's popular game \"Fancy Pants Adventures\". A one-level beta was released on November 11, 2008, with an expanded three-level beta released on February 24, 2009. The developer's site states that \"the full \"Mirror's Edge 2D\" has been released, but we're still in beta.\"\n\nA version of \"Mirror's Edge\" for the iPhone and iPod Touch was announced on December 2, 2009. It is a side-scrolling game with 3D graphics, featuring 14 levels and dynamic camera angles, and was scheduled for release in January 2010. It was then later revealed that the iPhone and iPod Touch versions were pushed back to an April release. EA Mobile released \"Mirror's Edge\" for iPhone and iPod touch on September 1, 2010. An iPad version was released on April 1, 2010. The game was also ported to Windows Phone in 2012.\n\nA second game was revealed at the Electronic Arts' press event at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013 to be released on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One at an undetermined time. The game is a prequel to \"Mirror's Edge\", showcasing the origins of Faith, and uses the newer Frostbite 3 engine. Electronic Arts stated that the game is an \"open-world action adventure\". According to DICE's general manager Karl Magnus Troedsson, the prequel has combat mechanics that are more refined than those in the first game. In January 2014, writer Rhianna Pratchett had announced on Twitter that neither she nor any other members of the first game's writing team would be involved with the new game's development. Some early developments of the game were featured at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014. On June 8, 2015, EA filed a trademark for the upcoming \"Mirror's Edge\" game \"Mirror's Edge: Catalyst\" which was later confirmed as the game's title the next day on June 9. At Gamescom 2015 it was revealed that it is a reboot of the \"Mirror's Edge\" franchise. \"Mirror's Edge Catalyst\" was released June 2016.\n\nIn May 2016, Endemol Shine North America announced that they are producing a TV show based on the \"Mirror's Edge\" franchise.\n\nThe art style of \"Mirror's Edge\" has been a major inspiration for the implementation of procedural architecture in the open source video game Citybound.\n\n"}

{"id": "53746177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53746177", "title": "Online credentials for learning", "text": "Online credentials for learning\n\nOnline credentials for learning are digital credentials that are offered in place of traditional paper credentials for a skill or educational achievement. They are directly linked to the accelerated development of internet communication technologies, the development of digital badges, electronic passports and massive open online courses (MOOCs).\n\nOnline credentials have their origin in the concept of open educational resources (OER), which was invented during the Forum on Open Courseware for Higher Education in Developing Countries held in 2002 at UNESCO. Over the next decade the OER concept gained significant traction, and this was confirmed by the World Open Educational Resources (OER) Congress organized by UNESCO in 2012. One of the outcomes of the congress was to encourage the open licensing of educational materials produced with public funds. Creative Commons licensing provides the necessary standardization for copyright permissions, with a strong emphasis on the shift towards sharing and open licensing.\n\nTest-based credentials have gained popularity both in the online market, and in programming and highly technical tasks. These credentials are earned by taking multiple-choice or project-based tests in various skill areas.\n\nBadges allow individuals to demonstrate job skills, educational accomplishments, online course completion or just about anything else that a badge creator decides. The concept is still quite flexible and undefined. Badges support capturing and translating learning across contexts; encouraging and motivating participation and learning outcomes; and formalizing and enhancing existing social aspects of informal and interest-driven learning.\n\nIn Europe, since 2000, the work of the CEDEFOP and the adoption in 2009 of the European Guidelines for Validating Non-formal and Informal Learning have supported the development of policies and programmes periodically monitored through the European inventory on validation of non-formal and informal learning.\n\nOnline or digital badges are not dissimilar to the concept of the Europass CV. With open badges the process is more decentralized and removed from the traditional quality assurance bodies: A criticism of open badges, such as those developed by Mozilla, is that they lack a credible quality assurance component. On the positive side, open badges are free and allow for the inclusion of various forms of learning, including non-formal and informal learning.\n\nAmong alternative credentials, online certificates currently command the highest value, and are nearly comparable to a traditional degree. Earning an online certificate from an online college, a company or an industry-specific organization is typically much more involved than for the other credentials. The certificates are often connected to specific job functions. Many of these certificates have been created by companies such as Cisco, IBM or Microsoft to meet their own needs or the needs of their customers.\n\nFuture challenges for the concept that have been identified include the way issuing and earning process for the badges is quality-assured; the centralization (or not) of the badge-issuing process and the legitimacy of any organization that takes charge of it; the way badge issuers are using the open standard to ensure that the learners stay in control and badges remain interoperable; and the way badges will be used and recognized by education institutions, enterprises and individuals.\n\n"}

{"id": "999666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=999666", "title": "Satiric misspelling", "text": "Satiric misspelling\n\nA satiric misspelling is an intentional misspelling of a word, phrase or name for a rhetorical purpose. This is often done by replacing a letter with another letter (for example, \"k\" replacing \"c\"), or symbol (for example, \"$\" replacing \"s\", \"@\" replacing \"a\", or \"¢\" replacing \"c\"). Satiric misspelling is found particularly in informal writing on the Internet, but can also be found in some serious political writing that opposes the status quo.\nReplacing the letter \"c\" with \"k\" in the first letter of a word came into use by the Ku Klux Klan during its early years in the mid-to-late 19th century. The concept is continued today within the group.\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s in the United States, leftists, particularly the Yippies, sometimes used \"Amerika\" rather than \"America\" in referring to the United States. It is still used as a political statement today. It is likely that this was originally an allusion to the German spelling of the word, and intended to be suggestive of Nazism, a hypothesis that the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" supports.\n\nIn broader usage, the replacement of the letter \"c\" with \"k\" denotes general political skepticism about the topic at hand and is intended to discredit or debase the term in which the replacement occurs.\n\nA similar usage in Italian, Spanish, Catalan and Portuguese is to write \"okupa\" rather than \"ocupa\" (often on a building or area occupied by squatters, referring to the name adopted by \"okupación\" activist groups), which is particularly remarkable because the letter \"k\" is not part of the Spanish, Portuguese or Italian alphabets. It stems from a combination of English borrow words with k in them to those languages, and Spanish anarchist and punk movements which used \"k\" to signal rebellion.\n\nReplacing \"c\" with \"k\" was at the centre of a Monty Python joke from the Travel Agent sketch. Eric Idle has an affliction that makes him pronounce the letter C as a B, as in \"bolour\" instead of \"colour.\" Michael Palin asks him if he can say the letter K? Idle replies that he can, and Palin suggests that he spell words with a K instead of C. Idle replies, \"what, spell bolour with a K? Kolour. Oh! I never thought of that before! What a silly bunt!\"\n\nThe video game franchise Mortal Kombat is another example of this trend.\n\nA common satiric usage of the letters \"KKK\" is the spelling of \"America\" as \"Amerikkka\", alluding to the Ku Klux Klan, drawing to a perceived notion of an underlying or inherent racism in American society. The earliest known usage of \"Amerikkka\" recorded in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is in 1970, in a journal called \"Black World\". Presumably, this was an extrapolation from the then already widespread \"Amerika\".\n\nThe spelling \"Amerikkka\" came into greater use after the 1990 release of the gangsta rap album \"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted\" by Ice Cube, also used by rapper Spice 1 for his album \"AmeriKKKa's Nightmare\" and by shock rock band Undercover Slut for their album \"Amerikkka Macht Frei\".\n\nThe letters \"KKK\" have been inserted into several other words and names, to indicate similar perceived racism, oppression or corruption. Examples include:\n\nThe dollar sign ($) can be inserted in the place of the letter \"S\", the euro sign (€) in place of \"e\", the yen (¥) sign in place of \"Y\", the won (₩) sign in place of \"W\", or the pound (£) sign in place of \"L,\" or the rupee sign (₹) in place of \"R\" to indicate plutocracy, greed, corruption, or the perceived immoral, unethical, or pathological accumulation of money. For example:\n\nSince at least 1980, people have used the \"at sign\" (\"@\") as a representation of the circled letter A. This has been extended to substituting it for the letter \"A\" as in the Crass fanzine \"Toxic Gr@fity\".\n\nIn Spanish, it became informally common (but not accepted by the RAE, due to @ being a symbol and not a letter) to use @ in place of \"o/a\" to denote both genders. For example, \"señorit@\" can be used to mean \"señorita and/or señorito\" instead of using \"señorita/o.\"\n\nOccasionally a word written in its orthodox spelling is altered with internal capital letters, hyphens, italics, or other devices so as to highlight a fortuitous pun. Some examples:\n\nAlong the same lines, intentional misspellings can be used to promote a specific negative attribute, real or perceived, of a product or service. This is especially effective if the misspelling is done by replacing part of the word with another that has identical phonetic qualities.\n\nSome place names are also spelled differently in order to emphasize some political view. For instance, \"Brasil\" (the Portuguese spelling of \"Brazil\"), is sometimes misconstrued as a typo for \"Brazil\" in English texts. Alternatively, the English spelling \"Brazil\" is used in Portuguese pieces of text as a way to denote anti-Americanism or anti-globalization sentiment.\n\nJournalists may make a politicized editorial decision by choosing to differentially retain (or even create) misspellings, mispronunciations, ungrammaticisms, dialect variants, or interjections.\n\nPlays on acronyms and initialisms are also common, when the full name is spelled out but one of the component words is replaced by another. For example, Richard Stallman and other Free Software Foundation executives often refer to digital rights management as \"digital restrictions management\", a reference to the tendency for DRM to stifle the end user's ability to reshare music or write CDs more than a certain number of times. Likewise, the National Security Agency is often referred to as the \"National Surveillance Agency\" and sometimes \"National Socialist Agency\" by opponents of its PRISM program, who view it as dystopian encroachment on personal privacy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56983728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56983728", "title": "Scoundrel Days: A Memoir", "text": "Scoundrel Days: A Memoir\n\nScoundrel Days is a memoir by Australian contemporary poet Brentley Frazer. Described as \"\"a gritty, Gen X memoir, recounting wild escapades into an under-culture of drugs and violence and sex\" by ABC Radio National and by the publisher as \"Tom Sawyer on acid, a 21st-century On the Road, a Holden Caulfield for punks\", literary critic Rohan Wilson compared Frazer's ability to shock, surprise and unsettle with that of Marcel Duchamp, concluding: \"\"Frazer is writing here in the tradition of Helen Garner, Andrew McGahan and Nick Earls\".\"This is dirty realism at its dirtiest\" \".\n\n\"Scoundrel Days\" was first published in Australia in March 2017 by University of Queensland Press in trade paperback format. Frazer wrote \"Scoundrel Days\" as the creative component of a Doctoral thesis in experimental creative non-fiction while a post-graduate student at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia. In an academic paper published by \"TEXT Journal\" describing the writing process of \"Scoundrel Days\", Frazer refers to the work as a \"'novelised memoir, written in first person present perfect . . . there is no Wonder Years voiceover telling you what to think\".'\n\nDuring an interview on Radio National \"ABC Nightlife\" Frazer recounted that he first began to write \"Scoundrel Days\" in 1993 while living between share-houses in Fortitude Valley: \"'The very first draft was disorder manifest, simply typed up transcriptions from journals written while itinerant, hitch-hiking or on long distance trains and buses between Townsville and Brisbane from the mid 80s. I abandoned several drafts, lost several in floods and evictions, working on it sometimes for a year and sometimes not wanting to look at it at all for months, all the while I kept doing stupid things to get more material to write about. The final draft came together when I decided to get very serious about learning how to write a novel and successfully pitched the work in progress to undertake a PhD in creative writing . . . I wrote the final sentence and felt comfortable thinking of it as finished and ready to submit to publishers in 2015, so, yeah, it took more than twenty years to write\".'\n\nThe underlying narrative arc is of rejection and redemption, of anarchy and order, hate and love. The story follows a recalcitrant boy who finds the sacred bond of familial trust broken by parents who, since their own birth, are members of a secretive fundamentalist evangelical Christian cult. Exacerbating this Amish like environment is his father's job as a police officer and his dad has an ever-watchful eye on those who transcend both God and Man's rules and regulations. The first part of the book deals with the hyperbolic bravado the author adopts to counter his social standing as weirdo and cop's son in an outback mining town in far north Queensland. He starts a gang and adopts an outlook that one critic has described as 'anti coming of age' […] in this type of story the protagonist is far less mutable than they have any right to be. Instead, he is stubbornly sure of himself and resistant to change. Rather than stumble with trepidation through his teenage years he bypasses puberty and charges into adult situations with an unwarranted confidence.\n\nAfter the family relocate to Townsville in 1984 he encounters extreme bullying at high school and soon befriends a dangerous and violent punk named Reuben, also new to town, who grew up on the streets of Sydney. After Reuben almost murders a bully in the schoolyard during one of numerous fights and our protagonist narrowly escapes a predatory pederast preacher visiting the family home, the two boys flee and go on a series of breath-taking adventures, soaked in smut and crime, walking on the very edge of life and death, up and down the east coast of Australia. The exploits and the break-neck pace of the narrative do not let up until the late 1990s when redemption comes and the protagonist finds love with a young woman who checkmates his immorality and self-destructive tendencies.\n\nWritten in a transgressive minimalist style and leaning heavily on techniques developed by Tom Spanbauer's theories of Dangerous Writing, \"Scoundrel Days\" has been described as reading with: \"a visceral and urgent internal perspective which is both direct and poetic, often charming, and sometimes bleakly funny,\" \"gritty with a lyrical cadence,\" \"a nervy present-perfect tense reminiscent of the hyperbolic, ugly-beautiful prose of Kathy Acker,\" a terse telegraphic prose that brings the reader very close to the details laid down thick and terrible, and as \"an immersive, vital prose that almost drags the reader along.\" \n\n\"Scoundrel Days\" is marketed as a memoir, but does not use the reflective voice common to the genre, and therefore reads like a novel. It is Bildungsroman in that it examines the author's formative years and also explicitly his spiritual education. It is Künstlerroman in the tradition of Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Look Homeward, Angel and Ham on Rye, as from the outset the reader witnesses the emergence of the poet from the psychosocial chrysalis of childhood, and it is an autobiographical Roman à clef novel like those of Henry Miller and Jack Kerouac. All the fictitious names of the characters portray real people, all the events represent real events in the author's life but the ever-present drugs and alcohol lend an hallucinatory quality, which challenges the readers ability to trust the author's recall. It is this effective use of the unreliable narrator that has led both the publisher and the critics to compare the protagonist of \"Scoundrel Days\" with Tom Sawyer, Sal Paradise and Holden Caulfield.\n\nFrazer composed \"Scoundrel Days\" using an obscure literary constraint. According to Frazer's Doctoral thesis, is the first long-form creative work in history composed entirely in English Prime, a language discipline in which there are no tenses of the verb “to be”. By using this technique and abandoning the copula (are, am, is, was, were, be, etc.,), it's misuse which results in Deity mode of speech (Bourland Jr & Kellogg III, 1990), the literary voice of the narrator becomes what Frazer refers to as, \"Human Mode of Speech\", the problem of show vs tell fades to insignificance as the narrative moves from \"the showing to the doing\". The result is a narrative that one critic wrote 'should become the gold-standard how-to manual on writing clear, utterly active prose.'\n\nThe author himself, talking about the writing of \"Scoundrel Days\" during an interview on \"Radio National\", Canberra (Books and Arts) hosted by Michael Cathcart and Cassie McCullagh, says he is influenced by Henry Miller, but does not like the misogyny, sexual violence and overuse of gendered nouns present in Miller's work. Frazer says he made sure that those things never happened in his writing, and says he did not want to give the readers a shocking, judgemental explicitness. Frazer denies there is any misogyny in the writing of his experiences, and says he is a passive partner. McCullagh says she was around in the time when the book was based, and asks about the genuine sexual nature of the women around the 1980s and 1990s. Frazer says the females in the smaller country towns were bored and very adventurous, and says they were experimenting sexually earlier on, as were the boys. He talks about the human drive to have freedom, and his way of life during the time of the memoir. He says he put new techniques borrowed from the world of filmmaking in his book for the more astute readers, and says he only sees the central figure as a slightly magnified character. McCullagh asks Frazer about the time when the memoir was based, and asks him to describe the narrative arc of the time frame. Frazer discusses the contents of the book, the situations he put himself into to create an exciting narrative, and the influence of the character Tom Sawyer written by Mark Twain's had on his own life. He says he stopped pushing the boundaries when he fell in love, and said his lifestyle as a sort-of teenaged Valmont had given him enough lived experience to write the memoir.\n\nFocusing mainly on the lifestyle and proclivities of bohemian artists, writers and poets in Australia in the 80s and 90s the book largely functions as a meditation on the pursuit of total artistic and personal freedom and embodies the philosophy of Oscar Wilde's tenet Life imitates Art; the living and the writing are one and the same, indistinguishable to the protagonist. Transgressive tropes abound: promiscuity, group sex, drugs, institutionalised violence, anti-socialism, nihilism, immorality, perversion and crime are the main focus and the young poet, disillusioned with his parents and the foundational morality of their religious cult, rejects the corruption he perceives in society by getting out of control. He becomes a problem. Precocious, brash, and certain of his own perceptions, he reads poetry and despises any attempt to socialise him into a system he has no intention of joining. \"Scoundrel Days\" pays homage to lost boys who grow up to be troubled young men. Frazer's childhood in Greenvale, 220 kilometres northwest of Townsville, is populated by budding pugilists, often themselves the victims of casual violence or sexual abuse. More than once there looms a drunken father as awful as Pap in \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\".\n\nGrowing up godless in a \"deranged, apocalyptic\" cult, Frazer develops a disdain for authority, cemented by his run-ins with the ne'er-do-wells in his policeman father's cells, and also the \"tramp preachers\" who pass through town and who have a tendency to wander into the bathroom as he showers.\n\nAlready inured to pain and violence through living next door to the lock-up where his father works as the local cop, Brentley arrives at school and his world expands, as does his capacity for observation and recall. Brentley, the outsider – the weird kid – takes all the punches in the gut from the outset and consequently becomes wary, vigilant and extremely self-conscious. He watches himself act, and soon learns how to put on other personas and slip into characters from the books he reads. \"Scoundrel Days\" examines the concepts of conscience and morality and how we form them. Do we acquire the inner voice? Or does it emerge from within, inherent, like the colour of one’s eyes? This memoir throws up questions about the nature of conscience, which propels much of young Brentley’s character development.\n\nUnder it all lies a dark, nihilist void where, like Gordon in Andrew McGahan’s Praise (1992), expectation is seen as the root of unhappiness. But unlike Gordon, who slouches towards destruction content in the acceptance of a flawed physicality, Frazer oscillates between bravado and moments of self-awareness. This enigmatic, self-styled outsider bravely lets us into the inner sanctum, which makes for a fascinating read.\n\nThe true identity of the characters portrayed in \"Scoundrel Days\" have not been revealed by the author.\n\nOther than the first person narrator 'Brentley', the major characters include, in order of appearance:\n\nAn elder indigenous Australian who is a Kuradji (similar to a shaman) and opens the young protagonist's eyes to the injustices of the European invader.\n\nA boy also born into the cult but is a secret member of a locally notorious graffiti posse \"The Heartbreak Kids\" and serves as the protagonist's link to:\n\nA ward of the state half Australian Aboriginal street artist and leader of graffiti posse The Heartbreak Kids. Described as resembling the pop star Prince and an expert at breakdancing and break and entering.\n\nA half Australian Aboriginal bully and the schoolyard nemesis of the protagonist. Described as an anorexic leather jacket dragged through broken windscreens and thorny interpersonal relationships.\n\nThe son of a British Army Captain and a violent brawler with an unfortunate facial scar who dresses like a Greaser.\n\nThe protagonist's first childhood girlfriend who awakens him to idealised romantic love.\n\nReuben\n\nThe antihero of the book. A maladjusted, sociopathic and violent street kid who was the leader of a Sydney razor gang, described as both resembling spaghetti western heartthrob Terence Hill and as a deadly Nureyev.\n\nA beautiful bisexual junky who is a student of fashion design and a nude artist's model. The protagonist meets her in a nightclub and the pair becomes inseparable for about seven years in the timeline of the narrative. Described as a miniature replica of Audrey Hepburn who dresses like Siouxsie Sioux and dances like a Fraggle on acid wearing roller skates.\n\nAn expat New Zealand musician who the protagonist meets at a model agency in Melbourne. Josef moves in with Brentley to start a punk band, much to the disdain of Candy. Josef spends several years on and off share housing with the couple between Melbourne, Brisbane and Townsville. Described as a thin hipped bass-playing kiwi bastard.\n\nA neo-beat poet from Brisbane who Brentley meets at a poetry reading in 1994. Yuri moves into an apartment shared by Brentley, Candy and Candy's sister Marie, an artist with the proclivity of painting in the nude and instigating group sex with the two poets whenever her sister is absent.\n\nIn the first six months of its publication \"Scoundrel Days\" was reviewed by The Australian, The Australian Book Review, The Newtown Review of Books, all the metropolitan newspapers of Fairfax Media (The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Canberra Times, The Brisbane Times, et al.), The Saturday Paper, Vogue Magazine, The Brag, Good Reading Magazine and nationally on ABC radio.\n\nFrazer was immediately compared with Kerouac, Salinger and Twain (as asserted by the publisher) but also Henry Miller, Kathy Acker, Helen Garner, Andrew McGahan, Christos Tsiolkas, Nick Earls, Charlotte Wood, Elizabeth Harrower, Ruth Park, Justine Ettler and Christina Stead.\n\nWhile the critics unanimously agreed that an important new literary voice had arrived on the Australian literary scene and gave universal acclaim for the quality and power of the writing (\"addictive and compellin\"g, \"that rarest of literary treats: a good dose of the shocking\", \"how brilliant is the writing? Like poetry written with a nail gun. Shit he's good. Uncommonly good\", \"a roller-coaster ride of wild excess and anti-authoritarian adventures told in urgent and beautiful prose\" ) and all commended its groundbreaking status in the discipline of E-Prime, the books subject matter was widely condemned and its veracity challenged. One reviewer wrote: \"So little of the story features ordinary doings that the reader must wonder how much comprises recollections from childhood and how much adventure arising in the writer’s imagination. Notwithstanding that, the level of detail speaks to authentic recall rather than confabulation. But this writer’s mind runs on no ordinary tracks.\n\n\"The Saturday Paper\" argued that the writing of the beat generation has been a toxic influence on the literature of male writers in the late 20th and early 21st centuries and the days of readers wishing to revel in aggressively masculine, hedonistic worlds of hard drinking, drug-taking and sexual conquest are long gone. Literary critic Pam Greet wrote: Fuelled by drugs, alcohol, thousands of cigarettes, and punctuated by sex, violence, and wanton acts of both public and private (self-) destruction, Brentley Frazer’s memoir does not scream ‘poet in the making’.\n\n\"The Australian\" singled out the sexual escapades of the author for criticism, writing this is what seems to get author in the most trouble, \"predatory religious figures, horny American backpackers, or desperately lonely long-distance lovers, our hero is never more than a few steps away from some new entanglement [...]\" They shed little light on who Brentley was at these points in his life, and [as] the women come and go and we learn barely more about them than what they look like. \"The question of misogyny starts to peek out of the text\" but any sense that it might be dealt with is forestalled until later on. Pam Greet also criticised Frazer's female characters, writing: Other writers describe Scoundrel Days as demonic, compelling, transcendent, sublime, radical. For me, scary. Frazer’s females I found especially difficult. Three basic groups include sisters and family relatives (thinly rendered: ‘I said to my mother once during an argument that I’ll never forgive her for getting me circumcised, that my recalcitrant attitude results from her karma.’), teachers and deputy principals (condemned by position) and girlfriends/sex objects (sex seemingly one of the only things that mattered: girlfriends, their sisters, their mothers, their friends, twosomes, threesomes, whatever).\n\nThe \"Newtown Review of Books\" questioned the precociousness of the protagonist, questioning: how does the young teen find the fortitude to reject his family’s religious beliefs? How does he decide to act and expose a predatory preacher at such a tender age, when no one else will? How can he be so attached to a violent punk like Reuben, whom he loves like a brother? How could he have sex with his girlfriend’s sisters, able to blithely ‘slaunt’ from one risky sexual encounter to the next, then somehow develop into an adult capable of deep empathy? Brisbane radio station 4ZZZ referred to \"Scoundrel Days\" as \"A Boy's Manifesto for Brutal Disrespect of Self\" and heavily criticised the author's laissez-faire and bohemian attitude to excessive smoking, drinking, drugs, violence and promiscuity; arguing that it is irresponsible of the publisher to market such a book to troubled young men and inappropriate for the author to encourage seeking value in vice. \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" makes a subtle reference to the books inherent promiscuity, dangerous living, drug taking and possible hyperbole, writing that \"\"Frazer scatters memories like used tissues in share houses across Brisbane, Townsville, Airlie Beach, Melbourne and Perth. He subsists on pot noodles and weed, fuelled by Kerouac, Byron, Burroughs and Russian revolutionaries. Money, he reckons, is \"coloured paper printed by some swindler [...] Sometimes the yarns stretch into tales taller than Mount Surprise, but then Scoundrel Days is more autobiographical fiction than memoir\".\". The Newtown Review of Books commented \"Scoundrel Days\" contains enough meat for half a dozen creative writing theses, but \"violence emerges as the major theme\" [...] teens who railed against stultifying suburban hells of the late 20th century and came of age in share houses, surviving on shit jobs and the dole, will recall \"the taste of amphetamine and cheap booze and the smell of mouldy sheets on a stained mattress\". The Brag also made point of noting \"the tender age\" at which the protagonist learns the meanings of the words suicide, rape, jacking off, growling out, and a number of common swears [...] and while part of a rebellious schoolyard gang called The Wreckers, he discovers tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, amphetamines, pornography, madness, family violence and death.\n\nBesides the subject matter, other criticisms included the perception that Frazer did not include enough about the fundamentalist Christian cult which featured heavily in promotional material for the book. The Saturday Paper wrote: \"The shame is that Frazer’s childhood in The Truth is so teasingly dismissed, as he chooses instead to chronicle the most boring decade of a young literary hoon’s life, aping, for the umpteenth time, the tired old conventions of a movement whose toxic influence still lingers.\" \n\nOn \"Scoundrel Days\" the following notable Australian writers have commented:\n\n\"'How brilliant is the writing in Scoundrel Days? Like poetry written with a nail gun. Shit he's good. Uncommonly good. He's got a great eye, but also a lot of muscle to his writing, and that combo doesn't come along often enough. I hope he's got a lot more prose in him.\" ~ Nick Earls\n\n\"With a poet's eye for locating the marvellous within the commonplace and a novelist's ear for the nuances and rhythms of natural speech, Brentley Frazer has crafted a unique narrative from the myths and rumours of life and a wild imagination. Scoundrel Days is fiercely original, inspirational, and will no doubt find a wide, varied readership.\" ~ Anthony Lawrence\n\n\"An artist's true journey from blindness (or, what we call youth) into glimmerings of sight (coming of age). The writing is wonderful, and the writer lives in the tradition of the Beats, yet has managed to create something new through his use of the E-prime constraint.\" ~ Dr Venero Armanno, (\"Black Mountain\" and \"The Dirty Beat\")\n\n\"A unique new voice in the Australian literary landscape.\" ~ Lindsay Simpson (\"Brothers in Arms\" and \"The Curer of Souls\")\n\nIn an opinion piece in \"The Australian\", the critic writes: \"as far as anyone knows, this is the first time anyone has attempted a full-length memoir without the copula. Friends have asked me: “OK, that sounds cute, but is it any good?” Which is a question forbidden under the rules. But yes. It is.\" ~ Caroline Overington\n\nJenny Valentish for Fairfax Media writes: \"Frazer is a legendary protagonist, in the vein of Bukowski’s literary alter-ego [...] His writing is sometimes compared to that of Andrew McGahan, in particular, McGahan’s coming-of-age novel Praise, but Scoundrel Days spends little time examining the consistency of its author’s bodily fluids. Instead, he uses that nervy present-perfect tense to take us further, faster, harder. It has more in common with the hyperbolic, ugly-beautiful prose of Kathy Acker.”\" \n\n“Poet and author Brentley Frazer recounts his rebellious youth with searing honesty in his memoir Scoundrel Days. Gritty with a lyrical cadence, the characters and violent, drug-fuelled, sexually-charged experiences he recounts are compelling for their raw detail and darkness. Frazer’s innate attraction to dissent, his untamed spirit and how it shaped his young life will sometimes shock, but makes reading his words an addiction in itself.” ~ Vogue Magazine, Australia\n\n\"“\"Scoundrel Days is the compelling memoir from poet Brentley Frazer about his misspent adolescence in Queensland, a roller-coaster ride of wild excess and anti-authoritarian adventures told in urgent and beautiful prose.” —Sunday Life Magazine, READ, Sun Herald and Sunday Age\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1945670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1945670", "title": "Sound transmission class", "text": "Sound transmission class\n\nSound Transmission Class (or STC) is an integer rating of how well a building partition attenuates airborne sound. In the USA, it is widely used to rate interior partitions, ceilings/floors, doors, windows and exterior wall configurations (see ASTM International Classification E413 and E90). Outside the USA, the Sound Reduction Index (SRI) ISO index or its related indices are used. As of 2012, these are defined in the ISO - 140 series of standards (under revision).\n\nThe STC rating figure very roughly reflects the decibel reduction in noise that a partition can provide. \n\nThe ASTM sound transmission loss test methods have changed every few years. Thus, STC results posted before 1999 may not produce the same results today, and the differences become wider as one goes further back in time–the differences in the applicable test methods between the 1970s and today being quite significant.\nThe STC number is derived from sound attenuation values tested at sixteen standard frequencies from 125 Hz to 4000 Hz. These Transmission Loss values are then plotted on a sound pressure level graph and the resulting curve is compared to a standard reference contour. Acoustical engineers fit these values to the appropriate \"TL\" Curve (or \"T\"ransmission \"L\"oss) to determine an STC rating. The measurement is accurate for speech sounds, but much less so for amplified music, mechanical equipment noise, transportation noise, or any sound with substantial low-frequency energy below 125 Hz. Sometimes, acoustical labs will measure TL at frequencies below the normal STC boundary of 125 Hz, possibly down to 50 Hz or lower, thus giving additional valuable data to evaluate transmission loss at very low frequencies, such as a subwoofer-rich home theater system would produce. Alternatively, Outdoor-Indoor Transmission Class (OITC) is a standard used for indicating the rate of transmission of sound between outdoor and indoor spaces in a structure that considers frequencies down to 80 Hz (Aircraft/Rail/Truck traffic) and is weighted more to lower frequencies.\n\nThe following sound isolation results and methodologies are presented with data that is measured within the standard frequency range specified by appropriate ASTM standards. Although it is worthwhile to discuss the utility of sound transmission loss data that lies outside the standard frequency range (especially in the low-frequency region), for simplicity results will be primarily be presented and discussed within these standard limitations.\n\nTypical interior walls in homes (1 sheet of 1/2″ (13 mm) gypsum wallboard (drywall) on either side of a 2x4 (90 mm) wood studs spaced 16\" (406 mm) on-center with fiberglass insulation filling each stud cavity) have an STC of about 33. When asked to rate their acoustical performance, people often describe these walls as \"paper thin.\" They offer little in the way of privacy. Multi-family demising partition walls are typically constructed with varying gypsum wallboard panel layers attached to both sides of double 2x4 (90 mm) wood studs spaced 16\" (406 mm) on-center and separated by a 1\" (25 mm) airspace. These double-stud walls vary in sound isolation performance from the mid STC-40s into the high STC-60s depending on the presence of insulation and the gypsum wallboard type and quantity. Commercial buildings are typically constructed using steel studs of varying widths, gauges, and on-center spacings. Each of these framing characteristics have an effect on the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees.\n\nAdding absorptive materials to the interior surfaces of rooms (e.g. fabric-faced fiberglass panels, thick curtains) will result in a decrease of reverberated sound energy within the room. However, absorptive interior surface treatments do not significantly improve the sound isolation from one room to another through demising partitions over the typical frequency range measured currently. Installing absorptive insulation (e.g., fiberglass batts, blow-in cellulose, mineral fiber batts) into the wall or ceiling cavities affects the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees, depending on the framing configuration and joist or stud depth. For example, the presence of type of insulation in single 2x4 wood stud framing spaced 16\" (406 mm) on-center results in only a few STC points. In contrast, adding standard fiberglass insulation to an otherwise empty cavity in light-gauge (25-gauge or lighter) steel stud partitions can result in a nearly 10 STC-point improvement. As the stud gauge becomes heavier, the presence and type of insulation matters less.\n\nThe effect of adding multiple layers of gypsum wallboard to a frame also varies depending on the framing type and configuration. Doubling the mass of a partition does not double the STC, as the STC is calculated from a non-linear decibel sound transmission loss measurement. So, whereas installing an additional layer of gypsum wallboard to a light-gauge (25-ga. or lighter) steel stud partition will result in about a 5 STC-point increase, doing the same on single wood or single heavy-gauge steel will result in only 2 to 3 additional STC points. Adding a second additional layer (to the already 3-layer system) does not result in as drastic an STC change as the first additional layer. The effect of additional gypsum wallboard layers on double- and staggered-stud partitions is similar to that of light-gauge steel partitions. Due to increased mass, poured concrete and concrete blocks typically achieve higher STC values (in the mid STC 40s to the mid STC 50s) than equally thick framed walls. However the additional weight, added complexity of construction, and poor thermal insulation tend to limit masonry wall partitions as a viable sound isolation solution in many building construction projects. Temperate climates and hurricane- or tornado-prone areas may, however, require the use of masonry walls for structural stability.\n\nStructurally decoupling the gypsum wallboard panels from the partition framing can result in a large increase in sound isolation when installed correctly. Examples of structural decoupling in building construction include resilient channels, sound isolation clips and hat channels, and staggered- or double-stud framing. The STC results of decoupling in wall and ceiling assemblies varies significantly depending on the framing type, air cavity volume, and decoupling material type. Great care must be taken in each type of decoupled partition construction, as any fastener that becomes mechanically (rigidly) coupled to the framing can short-circuit the decoupling and result in drastically lower sound isolation results.\n\nSound damping tapes and other materials have been used to reduce both vibration and sound transmission through materials since the early 1930s. Although the applications of sound damping was largely limited to defense and industrial applications such as naval vessels and aircraft in the past, recent research has proven the effectiveness of damping in interior sound isolation in buildings. Constrained-layer damping gypsum wallboard panels increase sound isolation in building partitions by drastically reducing the vibration of panels and, incidentally, the radiation of sound through panels. The shear loading of a highly visco-elastic interlayer sandwiched between two more rigid constraining layers causes decreased displacement due to vibration, reducing the amount of sound energy radiated through a panel between enclosures. Damped gypsum wallboard panels are effective in reducing sound transmission over a broad range of frequencies and especially useful for achieving high levels of speech privacy between partitions.\n\nSound isolation metrics, such as the STC, are measured in specially-isolated and designed laboratory test chambers. It is important to note that there are nearly infinite field conditions that will affect sound isolation \"in situ\" when designing or remodeling building partitions and enclosures. Partitions that are inadequately or inappropriately sealed—that contain back-to-back electrical boxes, untreated recessed lighting, and unsealed pipes to name just a few—provide flanking paths for sound. Sound flanking paths include any sound transmission path other than the wall or ceiling partition itself. Great care and caution must be applied to any acoustically-treated building partition to ensure that the field sound isolation performance more closely approaches laboratory-tested values (see data from the National Research Council of Canada.)\n\nSection 1207 of International Building Code 2006 states that separation between dwelling units and public and service areas must achieve STC 50 (STC 45 if field tested) for both airborne and structure-borne. However, not all jurisdictions use the IBC 2006 for their building or municipal code. In jurisdictions where IBC 2006 is used, this requirement may not apply to all dwelling units. For example, a building conversion may not need to meet this rating for all walls.\n\nIn serious cases (e.g., a bedroom adjacent to a home theater room, and an inconsiderate nocturnal neighbor, to boot) a partition to reduce sounds from high-powered home theater or stereo should ideally be STC 70 or greater, and show good attenuation at low frequencies. An STC 70 wall can require detailed design and construction and can be easily compromised by 'flanking noise', sound traveling around the partition through the contiguous frame of the structure, thus reducing the STC significantly. STC 65 to 70 walls are often designed into luxury multifamily units, dedicated home theaters, and high end hotels.\n\nSTC partition ratings taken from:\n\"Noise Control in Buildings: A Practical Guide for Architects and Engineers\"; Cyril M.

It was directed by Robert H. Fuentes III and produced by Toonz Entertainment for Imira Entertainment. Unlike Toonz's work on the second season of \"\", \"Race for the Future\" is set in the universe of the original animated series.\n\nViva Pictures acquired the rights to distribute the film in North America in 2015. Through Cinedigm, the film was released direct-to-video on DVD and streaming platforms on January 12, 2016.\n\nUnlike using the anime-style tradition, which the Speed Racer series was known for, the film utilizes a different style of animation.\n\nTo prevent car accident fatalities, Pops Racer and his company develop an orb that can send a vehicle and its occupants 15-seconds back in time. Fearing for his son's safety during a race in poor conditions, and without Speed's knowledge, Pops installs the object in the Mach 5 before it can be properly tested. Just as the race begins, a bolt of lightning strikes the car sending Speed, Trixie, Sparky, Spritle and Chim-Chim fifty years into the future.\n\nNow in 2062, the group is immediately arrested and brought to a sorting facility where the Mach-5 is seized. A robot parole officer explains that in an effort to keep humans safe, all labor is now handled by machines designed by Leland Industries, a company that formerly competed with Pops Motors in automotive sports. After tricking the robot into telling them the location of the Mach 5, the group comes across Sparky's son, who operates the recycling plant. He reveals that their future selves were imprisoned 10 years ago for starting the Road Rebels, a resistance group that's against a society run by robots due to a fear of eventual human enslavement. Claiming it would be futile to try to defeat Leland, Speed instead suggests they travel back in time to prevent the company from ever gaining that level of control. Sparky's son notes that the only way to afford an energy source powerful enough to fuel that level of time travel would be to win the Super Dome 1000, an exceedingly difficult racing event for robots. To prepare, the crew uses the plant's scrap vehicles to upgrade the Mach 5 to the Mach 5 Ultra. Speed, under the disguise as a robot named Speed Demon, and the group arrive at the arena where they're greeted by John Leland Jr., the owner of Leland Industries. Impressed by the Mach 5 Ultra and Speed Demon's design, he offers to buy them from Trixie should they finish the race.\n\nThe Road Rebels launch an attack on the streets just as the event begins. Trixie, Spritle and Chim-Chim assist in the offensive and get picked up by one of their members, Sparky's future wife Jennifer. Seeing Jennifer's glee at being able to see a version of her missing husband, Trixie is convinced to expose Leland's goals. Against Speed's orders, she and the rest of the group, including Sparky's son and Racer X, concoct a plan to disable Leland Industries' security and delete any of their ulterior motives, while Jennifer, Spritle and Chim-Chim stay on lookout. However, Leland Jr. catches on to the ruse when Trixie walks into his office and has the three detained by his robots. Outside, the parole robot from earlier catches up on Jennifer, Spritle and Chim-Chim, sounding the alarm to Leland's police robots who capture them.\n\nAs the third segment of the race begins, one of the competitors slams Speed into a pillar revealing his identity to the world and disqualifying him from the prize money. As Leland realizes the plot to go back in time and prevent his company's rise, the crowd cheers Speed on, convincing him to keep racing. Confused as to Speed's new motive, Leland reveals that he isn't actually a human, but an android built by the company's late founder. Fearing Speed may encourage a major rebellion, Leland then changes the prime directive of all robots from protecting humans to enslaving them.\n\nTrixie, Racer X, Sparky's son, Jennifer, Spritle, Chim-Chim, and the now captured Sparky, quickly escape from the containment bay and plan another assault on Leland Industries. Trixie calls Speed and tells him to join the attack, but he refuses. 100 miles from the finish, he makes his move to take first place, but in the struggle drives the Mach 5 Ultra off the track, plummeting into a pool. A 92-year-old Pops Racer rushes out from the sidelines to his son's rescue, activating the time orb and sending the Mach 5 Ultra back in the past and in the race. While talking to his father, Speed realizes that he can't just go back to the past and hope to prevent this future. Activating the Mach 5 Ultra's new hover functionality, he flies out of the stadium to rally nearby humans into confronting Leland. Leland then gets into his own jet to engage Speed. With the office empty, Sparky and his son try to shutdown the invasion plan while Trixie, Racer X and Jennifer mount a ground assault against the robots.\n\nSpeed eventually gets the upper hand in his dogfight with Leland by pretending to have lost flying functionality. As the android goes in to kill Speed, the Mach 5 Ultra suddenly flies causing Leland to crash. Just as that happens, Sparky successfully disables the robot army. They rush outside to tell everyone the good news and to install the power cell needed to take them back to the past. Sparky finishes up on the Mach 5 Ultra and the group begin to head home. Just as they do, Leland reactivates and chases them to the time warp portal. The group narrowly evades his attack and pass through as Leland crashes into the closing gate and explodes.\n\nBack in their time, Sparky makes plans to go on his first date with Jennifer as Speed apologizes to his father for being so reckless. Elsewhere, a shadowy figure steals the time orb.\n\n"}

They are now the largest women's singing competition in the world with over 8000 participants at the 2014 convention. There are two competitions for choruses (the international championships and the \"Harmony Classic\" for smaller choruses), and two competitions for quartets (the international championships and the \"Rising Star\" for young singers). Currently, the first three of these competitions are held together and form the Sweet Adelines International Convention. Over the course of competition history, the most successful chorus has been \"Melodeers Chorus \"from Chicago with seven championship titles, and the most successful quartet singer was Connie Noble who won with four separate quartets. \"Lustre Quartet\" from Baltimore holds the record for highest quartet score, and \"Rönninge Show Chorus\" from Stockholm for highest ever chorus score.\nThe first convention was held in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1947 for quartets – two years after the foundation of the first \"Sweet Adelines Inc.\" chapter in the city. The competition was expanded to include choruses in 1973 and in 2000 the Harmony Classic competition for small and medium-sized choruses was introduced. Originally, Harmony Classic was held independently but since 2009 all three are now hosted together and run over the course of the convention week. A fourth event, the \"Rising Star\" competition, was introduced in 1999 for quartets whose members are under-25 years old. It was also held as part of convention from 2009 until 2012 but due to scheduling and cost constraints is now held independently again. Many non-competitive performances are also held during convention week, including by the previous year's chorus and quartet champions.\n\nThe convention is usually held in a city in the continental United States but has thrice been held internationally (England 1977, Canada 1962, 2007) and four times in Hawaii (1969, 1987, 2008, 2013). A \"spectacular fifty-year anniversary celebration\" was held in New Orleans during the 1995 convention and the competition was to be held there a decade later in 2005, but was moved due to Hurricane Katrina. From 2015 to 2017, the city of Las Vegas hosted the convention – the first time that the event has stayed in the same location for more than one year. The 2020 \"75th Diamond Anniversary\" convention is expected to be the first use of the newly renovated Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky – expecting to draw 10,000 attendees.\n\n"}

It includes aspects of tea production, tea brewing, tea arts and ceremony, society, history, health, ethics, education, and communication and media issues.\n\nTea plays an important role in some countries. It is commonly consumed at social events, and many cultures have created intricate formal ceremonies for these events. Afternoon tea is a British custom with widespread appeal. Tea ceremonies, with their roots in the Chinese tea culture, differ among Asian countries, such as the Japanese or Korean versions. Tea may differ widely in preparation, such as in Tibet, where the beverage is commonly brewed with salt and butter. Tea may be drunk in small private gatherings (tea parties) or in public (tea houses designed for social interaction).\n\nThe British Empire spread its own interpretation of tea to its dominions and colonies, including regions that today comprise the states of Hong Kong, India, and Pakistan, which had pre-existing tea customs, as well as regions such as East Africa (modern day Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) and the Pacific (Australia and New Zealand) which did not have tea customs. The tea room or teahouse is found in the US, the UK, and Ireland.\n\nDifferent regions favor different varieties of tea—black, green, or oolong—and use different flavourings, such as herbs, milk, or sugar. The temperature and strength of the tea likewise vary widely.\n\nBubble tea, pearl milk tea (Chinese: 珍珠奶茶; pinyin: zhēnzhū nǎichá), or boba milk tea (波霸奶茶; bōbà nǎichá) is a tea beverage mixture with milk which includes balls of tapioca. Originating in Taiwan, it is especially popular in East Asia, including Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore, as well as Europe, Canada, and the United States. It is also known as black pearl tea or tapioca tea.\n\nTaiwanese tea culture also encompasses a more traditional tea culture inspired by China and Han immigrants to the island. Wild tea was first found in Taiwan by the Dutch East India Company. Successive waves of immigration to Taiwan have left a legacy of influences on tea culture.\n\nDue to the importance of tea in Chinese society and culture, tea houses can be found in most Chinese neighbourhoods and business districts. Chinese-style tea houses offer dozens of varieties of hot and cold tea concoctions. They also serve a variety of tea-friendly or tea-related snacks. Beginning in the late afternoon, the typical Chinese tea house quickly becomes packed with students and business people, and later at night plays host to insomniacs and night owls simply looking for a place to relax.\n\nThere are formal tea houses. They provide a range of Chinese and Japanese tea leaves, as well as tea making accoutrements and a better class of snack food. Finally there are tea vendors, who specialize in the sale of tea leaves, pots, and other related paraphernalia. Tea is an important item in Chinese culture and is mentioned in the \"Seven necessities of (Chinese) daily life\".\n\nIn China, at least as early as the Tang Dynasty, tea was an object of connoisseurship; in the Song Dynasty formal tea-tasting parties were held, comparable to modern wine tastings. As much as in modern wine tastings, the proper vessel was important and much attention was paid to matching the tea to an aesthetically appealing serving vessel.\n\nHistorically there were two phases of tea drinking in China based on the form of tea that was produced and consumed, namely: \"tea bricks\" versus \"loose leaf tea\".\n\nTea served before the Ming Dynasty was typically made from tea bricks. Upon harvesting, the tea leaves were either partially dried or were thoroughly dried and ground before being pressed into bricks. The pressing of Pu-erh is likely a vestige of this process. Tea bricks were also sometimes used as currency. Serving the tea from tea bricks required multiple steps:\n\nThe ground and whisked teas used at that time called for dark and patterned bowls in which the texture of the tea powder suspension could be enjoyed. The best of these bowls, glazed in patterns with names like oil spot, partridge-feather, hare's fur, and tortoise shell, are highly valued today. The patterned holding bowl and tea mixture were often lauded in the period's poetry with phrases such as \"partridge in swirling clouds\" or \"snow on hare's fur\". Tea in this period was enjoyed more for its patterns and less for its flavour. The practice of using powdered tea can still be seen in the Japanese Tea ceremony or \"Chadō\".\n\nAfter 1391, the Hongwu Emperor, the founder of the Ming Dynasty, decreed that tributes of tea to the court were to be changed from brick to loose-leaf form. The imperial decree quickly transformed the tea drinking habits of the people, changing from whisked teas to steeped teas. The arrival of the new method for preparing tea also required the creation or use of new vessels.\n\nTeawares made with a special kind of purple clay (Zisha) from Yixing went on to develop during this period (Ming Dynasty). The structure of purple clay made it advantageous material with tiny and high density, preferred for heat preservation and perviousness.\nSimplicity and rusticity dominated the idea of purple clay teaware decoration art. It became soon the most popular method of performing Chinese tea ceremony, which often combines literature, calligraphy, painting and seal cutting in Chinese culture.\n\nThe loose-leaf tea and the purple clay teaware is still the preferred method of preparing tea in Chinese daily life.\n\nThe English-style tea has evolved into a new local style of drink, the Hong Kong-style milk tea, more often simply \"milk tea\", in Hong Kong by using evaporated milk instead of ordinary milk. It is popular at \"cha chaan tengs\" and fast food shops such as Café de Coral and Maxims Express. Traditional Chinese tea, including green tea, flower tea, jasmine tea, and Pu-erh tea, are also common, and are served at dim sum restaurant during \"yum cha\".\n\n\"Main article: Korean tea ceremony\"\n\nThe Korean tea ceremony or \"darye\" (茶禮) is a traditional form of tea ceremony practiced in Korea. Darye literally refers to \"etiquette for tea\" or \"tea rite.\" The chief element of the Korean tea ceremony is the ease and naturalness of enjoying tea within an easy formal setting. Central to the Korean approach to tea is an easy and natural coherence, with fewer formal rituals, fewer absolutes, greater freedom for relaxation, and more creativity in enjoying a wider variety of teas, services, and conversation.\n\nGreen tea's traditional role in Japanese society is as a drink for special guests and special occasions. Green tea is served in many companies during afternoon breaks. Japanese often buy sweets for their colleagues when on vacation or business trips. These snacks are usually enjoyed with green tea. Tea will also be prepared for visitors coming for meetings to companies and for guests visiting Japanese homes. A thermos full of green tea is a staple on family or school outings as an accompaniment to bento (box lunches). Families often bring along proper Japanese teacups to enhance the enjoyment of the traditional drink.\n\nThe strong cultural association the Japanese have with green tea has made it the most popular beverage to drink with traditional Japanese cuisine, such as sushi, sashimi, and tempura. At a restaurant, a cup of green tea is often served with meals at no extra charge, with as many refills as desired. The best traditional Japanese restaurants take as much care in choosing the tea they serve as in preparing the food itself.\n\nMany Japanese are still taught the proper art of the centuries-old tea ceremony as well. Still, the Japanese now enjoy green tea processed using state of the art technology. Today, hand pressing—a method demonstrated to tourists—is taught only as a technique preserved as a part of the Japanese cultural tradition. Most of the ubiquitous vending machines also carry a wide selection of both hot and cold bottled teas. Oolong tea enjoys considerable popularity. Black tea, often with milk or lemon, is served ubiquitously in cafes, coffee shops, and restaurants.\n\nMajor tea-producing areas in Japan include Shizuoka Prefecture and the city of Uji in Kyoto Prefecture.\n\nOther infusions bearing the name \"cha\" are barley tea (\"mugi-cha\") which is popular as a cold drink in the summer, buckwheat tea (\"soba-cha\"), and hydrangea tea (\"ama-cha\").\n\nButter, milk, and salt are added to brewed tea and churned to form a hot drink called Po cha (\"bod ja\", where \"bod\" means Tibetan and \"ja\" tea) in Tibet ,Bhutan, and Nepal. The concoction is sometimes called \"cha su mar\", mainly in Kham, or Eastern Tibet. Traditionally, the drink is made with a domestic brick tea and yak's milk, then mixed in a churn for several minutes. Using a generic black tea, milk and butter, and shaking or blending work well too, although the unique taste of yak milk is difficult to replicate. (see recipe)\n\nTibet tea drinking has many rules. One such concerns an invitation to a house for tea. The host will first pour some highland barley wine. The guest must dip his finger in the wine and flick some away. This will be done three times to represent respect for the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. The cup will then be refilled two more times and on the last time it must be emptied or the host will be insulted. After this the host will present a gift of butter tea to the guest, who will accept it without touching the rim of the bowl. The guest will then pour a glass for himself, and must finish the glass or be seen as rude.\n\nThere are two main teas that go with the tea culture. The teas are butter tea and sweet milk tea. These two teas are only found in Tibet. Other teas that the Tibetans enjoy are boiled black teas. There are many tea shops in Tibet selling these teas, which travelers often take for their main hydration source.\n\nMyanmar (formerly Burma) is one of very few countries where tea is not only drunk but eaten as lahpet—pickled tea served with various accompaniments. It is called \"lahpet so\" (tea wet) in contrast to \"lahpet chauk\" (tea dry) or \"akyan jauk\" (crude dry) with which green tea—\"yeinway jan\" or \"lahpet yeijan\" meaning plain or crude tea—is made. In the Shan State of Myanmar where most of the tea is grown, and also Kachin State, tea is dry-roasted in a pan before adding boiling water to make green tea. It is the national drink in a predominantly Buddhist country with no national tipple other than the palm toddy. Tea sweetened with milk is known as \"lahpet yeijo\" made with \"acho jauk\" (sweet dry) or black tea and prepared the Indian way, brewed and sweetened with condensed milk. It is a very popular drink although the middle classes by and large appear to prefer coffee most of the time. It was introduced to Myanmar by Indian immigrants some of whom set up teashops known as \"kaka hsaing\", later evolving to just \"lahpetyei hsaing\" (teashop).\n\nBurma's street culture is basically a tea culture as people, mostly men but also women and families, hang out in tea shops reading the paper or chatting away with friends, exchanging news, gossip and jokes, nursing cups of Indian tea served with a diverse range of snacks from cream cakes to Chinese fried breadsticks (youtiao) and steamed buns (baozi) to Indian naan bread and samosas. Green tea is customarily the first thing to be served free of charge as soon as a customer sits down at a table in all restaurants as well as teashops.\n\nPubs and clubs, unlike in the West, have remained a minority pursuit so far. Teashops are found from the smallest village to major cities in every neighbourhood up and down the country. They are open from the crack of dawn for breakfast till late in the evening, and some are open 24 hours catering for long distance drivers and travellers. One of the most popular teashops in Yangon in the late 1970s was called \"Shwe Hleiga\" (Golden Stairs) by popular acclaim as it was just a pavement stall, with low tables and stools for the customers, at the bottom of a stairwell in downtown Yangon. Busy bus stops and terminals as well as markets have several teashops. Train journeys in Myanmar also feature hawkers who jump aboard with giant kettles of tea for thirsty passengers.\n\nLahpet (pickled tea) is served in one of two ways:\n\nThai tea (also known as Thai iced tea) or \"cha-yen\" () when ordered in Thailand is a drink made from strongly-brewed red tea that usually contains added anise, red and yellow food colouring, and sometimes other spices as well. This tea is sweetened with sugar and condensed milk and served chilled. Evaporated or whole milk is generally poured over the tea and ice before serving—it is never mixed before serving—to add taste and creamy appearance. Locally, it is served in a traditional tall glass and when ordered take-out, it is poured over the crushed ice in a clear (or translucent) plastic bag. It can be made into a frappé at more westernised vendors.\n\nIt is popular in Southeast Asia and in many American restaurants that serve Thai or Vietnamese food, especially on the West Coast. Although Thai tea is not the same as bubble tea, a Southeast and East Asian beverage that contains large black pearls of tapioca starch, Thai tea with pearls is a popular flavour of bubble tea.\n\nGreen tea is also very popular in Thailand, spawning many variations such as barley green tea, rose green tea, lemon green tea, etc. Thai green tea, however, is not to be confused with traditional Japanese green tea. Thai green tea tends to be very heavily commercialized and the taste is sweeter and easier to appreciate than bitter variations.\n\nTea is cultivated extensively in the north of the country, making Vietnam one of the world's largest exporters. The word in the Vietnamese language is trà (pronounced cha/ja) or chè. It is served unsweetened and unaccompanied by milk, cream, or lemon.\n\nTraditionally tea is frequently consumed as green tea (trà xanh). Variants of black tea (chè tàu) is also widely used although frequently scented with \"Jasminum sambac\" blossoms (chè nhài, trà lài). Huế is renowned for its tea scented with \"Nelumbo nucifera\" stamens (trà sen). \n\nIn Vietnamese restaurants, including eateries overseas, a complimentary pot of tea is usually served once the meal has been ordered, with refills free of charge.\n\nOne of the world's largest producers of tea, India is a country where tea is popular all over as a breakfast and evening drink. It is often served as masala chai with milk, sugar, and spices such as ginger, cardamom, black pepper and cinnamon. Almost all the tea consumed is black Indian tea, CTC variety. Usually tea leaves are boiled in water while making tea, and milk is added.\n\nOffering tea to visitors is the cultural norm in Indian homes, offices and places of business. Tea is often consumed at small roadside stands, where it is prepared by tea makers known as \"chai wallahs\".\n\nThere are three most famous regions in India to produce black teas- Darjeeling,Assam and Nilgiri. \"Strong, heavy and fragrant\" are 3 criteria for judging black tea.\nDarjeeling tea is known for its delicate aroma and light colour and is aptly termed as \"the champagne of teas\", which has high aroma and yellow or brown liquid after brewing. Assam tea is known for its robust taste and dark colour, and Nilgiri tea is dark, intensely aromatic and flavoured. Assam produces the largest quantity of Tea in India, mostly of the CTC variety, and is one of the biggest suppliers of major international brands such as Lipton and Tetley. The Tetley Brand, formerly British owned and one of the largest, is now owned by the Indian Tata Tea Limited company.\n\nOn April 21, 2012 the Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission (India), Montek Singh Ahluwalia, said that tea would be declared as national drink by April 2013. Speaking on the occasion, former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said a special package for the tea industry would be announced in the future to ensure its development. The move was expected to boost the tea industry in the country, but in May 2013 the ministry of commerce decided not to declare a national drink for fear of disrupting the competing coffee industry.\n\nTea is popular all over Pakistan and is referred to as \"chai\" (written as چائے). During British Rule tea became very popular in Lahore. Tea is usually consumed at breakfast, during lunch breaks at the workplace, and in the evening at home. Evening tea may be consumed with biscuits or cake. Guests are typically offered a choice between tea and soft drinks. It is common practice for homeowners to offer tea breaks to hired labour, and sometimes even provide them with tea during the breaks. Tea offered to labour is typically strong and has more sugar in it.\n\nIn Pakistan, both black and green teas are popular and are known locally as \"sabz chai\" and \"kahwah\", respectively. The popular green tea called kahwah is often served after every meal in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Pashtun belt of Balochistan. In the Kashmir region of Pakistan, Kashmiri chai or \"noon chai,\" a pink, milky tea with pistachios and cardamom, is consumed primarily at special occasions, weddings, and during the winter months when it is sold in many kiosks. In Lahore and other cities of Punjab this Kashmiri Chai or Cha (as pronounced in Punjabi, Kosher as well as in many Chinese dialects ) is common drink in the Punjab, brought by ethnic Kashmiris in the 19th century. Traditionally, it is prepared with Himalayan rock salt, giving it its characteristic pink color. It is taken with Bakar Khani as well as Kashmiri Kulcha (namkeen / salty version of Khand Kulcha). Namkeen Chai or Noon / Loon Cha or commonly called Kashmri Chai and some times Sheer (milk ) Cha or sabz chai(Green Tea as the same tea are used for making Khahwa /Green Tea) is sold and seen Gowal Mandi kiosks with Salt for Kashmiri as well as with sugar and pistachios for Non- Kashmris or those who like it with sugar . In the northern Pakistan regions of Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan, a salty buttered Tibetan style tea is consumed.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, usually black tea is served with milk and sugar, but the milk is always warmed. Tea is a hugely popular beverage among the Sri-Lankan people, and part of its land is surrounded by the many hills of tea plantations that spread for miles. Drinking tea has become part of the culture of Sri Lanka and it is customary to offer a cup of tea to guests. Many working Sri Lankans are used to having a mid-morning cup of tea and another in the afternoon. Black tea is sometimes consumed with ginger. In rural areas some people still have their tea with a piece of sweet jaggery\n\nTea found its way to Persia (Iran) through the Silk Road from India and soon became the national drink. The whole part of northern Iran along the shores of the Caspian Sea is suitable for the cultivation of tea. Especially in the Gilan province on the slopes of Alborz, large areas are under tea cultivation and millions of people work in the tea industry. That region covers a large part of Iran's need for tea. Iranians have one of the highest per capita rates of tea consumption in the world and since old times every street has had a \"Châikhâne\" (Tea House). Châikhânes are still an important social place. Iranians traditionally drink tea by pouring it into a saucer and putting a lump of rock sugar (\"qand\") in the mouth before drinking the tea.\n\nAs of 2016, Turkey tops the per capita tea consumption statistics at 6.96 pounds. \n\nTurkish tea or Çay is produced on the eastern Black Sea coast, which has a mild climate with high precipitation and fertile soil. Turkish tea is typically prepared using çaydanlık, an instrument especially designed for tea preparation. Water is brought to a boil in the larger lower kettle and then some of the water is used to fill the smaller kettle on top and steep several spoons of loose tea leaves, producing a very strong tea. When served, the remaining water is used to dilute the tea on an individual basis, giving each consumer the choice between strong (\"koyu\"/dark) or weak (\"açık\"/light). Tea is drunk from small glasses to enjoy it hot in addition to show its colour, with lumps of beetroot sugar. To a lesser extent than in other Muslim countries, tea replaces both alcohol and coffee as the social beverage. Within Turkey the tea is usually known as Rize tea.\n\nIn 2004, Turkey produced 205,500 tonnes of tea (6.4% of the world's total tea production), which made it one of the largest tea markets in the world, with 120,000 tons being consumed in Turkey, and the rest being exported. In 2010 Turkey had the highest per capita consumption in the world at 2.7 kg. As of 2013, the per-capita consumption of Turkish tea exceeds 10 cups per day and 13.8 kg per year. Tea is grown mostly in Rize Province on the Black Sea coast.\n\nTea is the national drink in Egypt, and holds a special position that even coffee cannot rival. In Egypt, tea is called \"shai\". Tea packed and sold in Egypt is almost exclusively imported from Kenya and Sri Lanka. The Egyptian government considers tea a strategic crop and runs large tea plantations in Kenya. Green tea is a recent arrival to Egypt (only in the late 1990s did green tea become affordable) and is not as popular.\n\nEgyptian tea comes in two varieties: Koshary and Saiidi. Koshary tea, popular in Lower (Northern) Egypt, is prepared using the traditional method of steeping black tea in boiled water and letting it set for a few minutes. It is almost always sweetened with cane sugar and is often flavored with fresh mint leaves. Adding milk is also common. Koshary tea is usually light, with less than a half teaspoonful per cup considered to be near the high end.\n\nSaiidi tea is common in Upper (Southern) Egypt. It is prepared by boiling black tea with water for as long as 5 minutes over a strong flame. Saiidi tea is extremely heavy, with 2 teaspoonfuls per cup being the norm. It is sweetened with copious amounts of cane sugar (a necessity since the formula and method yield a very bitter tea). Saiidi tea is often black even in liquid form.\n\nBesides true tea, herbal teas (or tisanes) are often served at the Egyptian teahouses, with ingredients ranging from mint to cinnamon and ginger to salep; many of these are ascribed medicinal qualities or health benefits in Egyptian folk medicine. Karkade, a tisane of hibiscus flowers, is a particularly popular beverage and is traditionally considered beneficial for the heart.\n\nLibyan tea is a strong beverage, black or green, served in small glass cups with foam or froth topping the glass. it is usually sweetened with sugar and traditionally served in three rounds. mint or basil is used for flavoring and traditionally the last round is served with boiled peanuts or almonds.\n\nTea plays an important part in the island's culture. Tea drinking allows for socialising with it commonly being served to guests and in the workplace.\n\nThe Mauritian peoples usually consume black tea, often with milk and sugar. Mauritius is a producer of tea, initially on a small scale when the French introduced the plant into the island around 1765. It was under later British rule that the scale of tea cultivation increased.\n\nThree major tea producers dominate the local market these are Bois Cheri, Chartreuse and Corson. The signature product is the vanilla-flavoured tea which is commonly bought and consumed on the island.\n\nMorocco is considered the largest importer of green tea worldwide.\n\nTea was introduced to Morocco in the 18th century through trade with Europe.\n\nMorocco consumes green tea with mint rather than black tea. It has become part of the culture and is used widely at almost every meal. The Moroccan people even make tea performance a special culture in the flower country. Moroccan tea is commonly served with rich tea cookies, fresh green mint leaves, local \"finger shape\" brown sugar, and colorful tea glasses and pots. Drinking Moroccan tea is not only a luxury of tongue, but also the eyes.\n\nIn the Sahel region on the southern fringe of the Sahara, green gunpowder tea is prepared with little water and large amounts of sugar. By pouring the tea into the glasses and back, a foam builds on top of the tea. Sahelian tea is a social occasion and three infusions, the first one very bitter, the second in between and the last one rather sweet are taken in the course of several hours.\n\nTea is an important social beverage to Somali people. It is called \"shaah\" in the Somali language. Tea was first introduced to Somalis through ancient trade with the Arabs and Indians. In major Somali towns there are many tea shops and tea stalls around busy market areas. Somalis consume tea at any time of the day but primarily at breakfast, in the late afternoon, called \"Asariyo\", and after or during supper. Any guest to a Somali household would be offered spiced Somali tea, known as \"Shaah Hawash\", as soon as he or she arrives. The tea is spiced with cardamom, cloves and sometimes dry ginger and is usually served milky and sweet. Tea is usually preferred over coffee in Somalia, however some Somalis prefer coffee over tea.\n\nSomalis usually drink tea with camel milk, but it's customary to serve black tea if it is to be consumed after a heavy meal. It is called \"Shaah Bigaysi\".\n\nSee also Dastarkhān, Kazakh cuisine, Silk Way, Kyrgyz cuisine, Tajik cuisine, Uzbek cuisine\n\nTea in Central Asia is known since foundation of Silk Way. In Kazakhstan traditional tea is black traditionally with milk, in Uzbekistan trational tea is green.\n\nSpecific tea culture has developed in the Czech Republic in recent years, including many styles of tearooms. Despite having the same name, they differ from British tearooms. Pure teas are usually prepared with respect to their country of origin, and good tea palaces may offer 80 teas from almost all tea-producing countries. Different tea rooms have also created blends and methods of preparation and serving.\n\nThe region of East Frisia is noted for its consumption of tea and its tea culture. Strong blends of Assam tea, Ceylon and Darjeeling (East-Frisian Blend) are served whenever there are visitors to an East Frisian home or other gathering, as well as with breakfast, mid-afternoon, and mid-evening.\n\nThe traditional preparation is as follows: A \"Kluntje\", a white rock candy sugar that melts slowly, is added to the empty cup (allowing multiple cups to be sweetened) then tea is poured over the Kluntje. A heavy cream \"cloud\" (\"Wölkje\"—a diminutive of 'cloud' in Frisian) is added to the tea \"water\", the sugar represents \"land\". It is served without a spoon and traditionally drunk unstirred, i. e. in three tiers: In the beginning one predominantly tastes the cream, then the tea and finally the sweet taste of kluntje at the bottom of the cup. Stirring the tea would blend all three tiers into one and spoil the traditional tea savouring. The tea is generally served with small cookies during the week and cakes during special occasions or on weekends as a special treat. The tea is said to cure headaches, stomach problems, and stress, among many other ailments. The tea set is commonly decorated with an East Friesian Rose design. As a guest, it is considered impolite to drink fewer than three cups of tea. Placing your cup upside down on the saucer or your spoon in the cup signals that you are finished and want no more tea.\n\nAlthough less visible than in the Czech Republic, tea culture exists in Slovakia. Tea rooms are considered an underground environment by many, but they continue to pop up almost in every middle-sized town. These tea rooms are appreciated for offering quiet environments with pleasant music. More importantly, they are usually non-smoking, unlike most pubs and cafés.\n\nThe podstakannik ('подстаканник'), or tea glass holder (literally \"thing under the glass\"), is a part of Russian tea tradition. A Russian tea glass-holder is a traditional way of serving and drinking tea in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, other CIS and ex-USSR countries. Expensive podstakanniks are made from silver, classic series are made mostly from nickel silver, cupronickel, and other alloys with nickel, silver or gold plating. In Russia, it is customary to drink tea brewed separately in a teapot and diluted with freshly boiled water ('pair-of-teapots tea', 'чай парой чайников'). Traditionally, the tea is very strong, its strength often indicating the hosts' degree of hospitality. The traditional implement for boiling water for tea used to be the samovar (and sometimes it still is, though usually electric). Tea is a family event, and is usually served after each meal with sugar (one to three teaspoonfuls per cup) and lemon (but without milk), and an assortment of jams, pastries and confections. Black tea is commonly used, with green tea gaining popularity as a more healthy, more \"Oriental\" alternative. Teabags are not used in the traditional Russian tea ceremony, only loose, large-leaf black tea.\n\nIn Russian prisons, where alcohol and drugs are prohibited, inmates often brew very strong tea known as 'chifir', in order to experience its mood-altering properties.\n\nWhile France is well known for its coffee drinking, afternoon tea has long been a social habit of the upper middle class, famously illustrated, for example, by Marcel Proust's novels. Mariage Frères is a famous high-end tea shop from Paris, active since 1854. The French tea market is still only a fraction of the British one (a consumption of 250 grams per person a year compared to about 2 kilos in the UK), but it has doubled from 1995 to 2005 and is still growing steadily. Tea in France is of the black variety, but Asian green teas and fruit-flavoured teas are becoming increasingly popular. French people generally drink tea in the afternoon. It is often taken in \"salons de thé\". Most people will add sugar to their tea (65%), then milk (25%), lemon (30%) or nothing (32%) are about equally popular. Tea is generally served with some pastries, including a variety of not so sweet ones reserved for tea drinking, like the \"madeleine\" and the \"financier\".\n\nIreland has, for a long time, been one of the biggest per capita consumers of tea in the world. Although broadly similar to tea culture in the United Kingdom, Irish tea culture has a number of distinguishing elements; for example, tea in Ireland is usually taken with milk or sugar and is slightly spicier and stronger than the traditional English Blend. Popular brands of tea sold in Ireland are Lyons, Barry's, and Bewley's.\n\nTea growing in Portugal takes place in the Azores, a group of islands located 1500 km west of Mainland Portugal. Portugal was the first to introduce the practice of drinking tea to Europe as well as the first European country to produce tea. \n\nIn 1750, terrains ranging from the fields of Capelas to those of Porto Formoso on the island of São Miguel were used for the first trial crops of tea. They delivered 10 kg of black tea and 8 kg of green tea. A century later, with the introduction of skilled workers from the Macau Region of China in 1883, production became significant and the culture expanded. Following the instructions of these workers, the species \"Jasminum grandiflorum\" and \"Malva vacciones\" were introduced to give 'nobility' to the tea aroma, though only the Jasminum was used.\n\nThis tea is currently traded under the name of the processed compound, \"Gorreana\", and is produced by independent families. No herbicides or pesticides are allowed in the growing process, and modern consumers associate the production with more recent organic teas. However, production standards concerning the plant itself and its cropping have not changed for the last 250 years.\n\nThe British are one of the largest tea consumers in the world, with each person consuming on average 1.9 kg per year. Tea is usually black tea served with milk and sometimes with sugar. Strong tea served with lots of milk and often two teaspoons of sugar, usually in a mug, is commonly referred to as \"builder's tea\" for its association with builders and more broadly with the working class. Much of the time in the United Kingdom, tea drinking is not the delicate, refined cultural expression that the rest of the world imagines—a cup (or commonly a mug) of tea is something drunk frequently throughout the day. This is not to say that the British do not have a more formal tea ceremony, but tea breaks are an essential part of the working day. The term is often shortened to 'tea', essentially indicating a break. This term was exported to the game of cricket and consequently to most other countries of the former British Empire.\n\nThe popularity of tea dates back to the 19th century when India was part of the British Empire, and British interests controlled tea production in the subcontinent. It was, however, first introduced in the UK by the Portuguese Catherine of Braganza, queen consort of Charles II in the 1660s and 1670s. As tea spread throughout the United Kingdom and through the social classes, tea gardens and tea dances developed. These would include watching fireworks or a dinner party and dance, concluding with an evening tea. The tea gardens lost value after World War II but tea dances are still held today in the UK.\n\nSome scholars suggest that tea played a role in the Industrial Revolution. Afternoon tea possibly became a way to increase the number of hours labourers could work in factories; the stimulants in the tea, accompanied by sugary snacks, would give workers energy to finish out the day's work. Further, tea helped alleviate some of the consequences of the urbanisation that accompanied the industrial revolution: drinking tea required boiling one's water, thereby killing water-borne diseases like dysentery, cholera, and typhoid.\n\nIn the United Kingdom \"tea\" is not only the name of the beverage, but also the name of a meal. The kind of meal that a person means depends very much on their social background and where they live. The differentiation in usage between dinner, supper, lunch and tea is one of the classic social markers of British English (see U and non-U English) and is discussed more fully at the article on tea as a meal. Briefly, afternoon tea (one example of which is the cream tea) is sweeter and earlier, while the high tea is the final meal of the day.\n\nAfternoon tea and its variants are the best known \"tea ceremony\" in the Commonwealth countries, available in homes and commercial establishments. In some varieties of English, \"tea\" refers to a savoury meal, see Australian usages of the term. Taiwanese bubble tea, known locally as pearl milk tea, has become widely popular in urban Australia, with multiple chains in every major city.\nIn Canada, various types of tea are used by many different indigenous tribes as healing and ceremonial medicines. For example, Ojibwe and Cree tribes in Ontario use Cedar Tea during sweat lodge ceremonies to cleanse and nourish their bodies. When European settlers arrived on North American shores, it was the indigenous people that taught them to make pine needle tea to help cure their scurvy; pine needles are a great source of vitamin C.\n\nIn the United States, tea can typically be served at all meals as an alternative to coffee, when served hot, or soft drinks, when served iced. Tea is also consumed throughout the day as a beverage. Afternoon tea, the meal done in the English tradition, is rarely served in the United States, although it remains romanticized by small children; it is usually reserved for special occasions like tea parties. \n\nRather than drinking tea hot, many Americans prefer tea served with ice. In fact, in the United States, about 80% of the tea consumed is served cold, or \"iced\". Iced tea has become an iconic symbol of the Southern United States and Southern hospitality, often appearing alongside summer barbecue cooking or grilled foods. Iced tea is often made as sweet tea, which is simply iced tea with copious amounts of sugar or sweetener.\n\nIced tea can be purchased like soda, in canned or bottled form at vending machines and convenience stores. This pre-made tea is usually sweetened. Sometimes some other flavorings, such as lemon or raspberry, are added. Many restaurants dispense iced tea brewed throughout the day from upright containers. \n\nDecaffeinated tea is widely available in the United States, for those who wish to reduce the physiological effects of caffeine.\n\nBefore World War II, the US preference for tea was equally split between green tea and black tea, 40% and 40%, with the remaining 20% preferring oolong tea. The war cut off the United States from its primary sources of green tea, China and Japan, leaving it with tea almost exclusively from British-controlled India, which produced black tea. After the war, nearly 99% of tea consumed was black tea. \"Green\", \"oolong\", and \"white\" teas have recently become more popular again, and are often touted as health foods.\n\nIn the past 15 years fast food coffee chains have made a huge impact on how Americans are exposed to herbal and exotic teas. Once considered a rarity, \"chai\", based on Indian \"masala chai\", has actually become a popular option for people who might drink a caffè latte. Although not as commercialized, Taiwanese-style Bubble tea has also become popular in the United States in recent years, often served in small local cafes in the same style as many coffee drinks.\n\nBrazilian tea culture has its origins with the infused beverages, or \"chás\" (), made by the indigenous cultures of the Amazon region. It has evolved since the Portuguese colonial period to include imported varieties and tea-drinking customs. There is a folk knowledge in Brazil which says that Brazilians, mainly the urban ones, have a greater taste for using sugar in teas than in other cultures due to the lack of habit to unsweetened drinks.\n\n"}

{"id": "7368760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7368760", "title": "Turkish art", "text": "Turkish art\n\nTurkish art refers to all works of visual art originating from the geographical area of what is present day Turkey since the arrival of the Turks in the Middle Ages. Turkey also was the home of much significant art produced by earlier cultures, including the Hittites, Ancient Greeks, and Byzantines. Ottoman art is therefore to the dominant element of Turkish art before the 20th century, although the Seljuks and other earlier Turks also contributed. The 16th and 17th centuries are generally recognized as the finest period for art in the Ottoman Empire, much of it associated with the huge Imperial court. In particular the long reign of Suleiman the Magnificent from 1520–1566 brought a combination, rare in any ruling dynasty, of political and military success with strong encouragement of the arts.\n\nThe \"nakkashane\", as the palace workshops are now generally known, were evidently very important and productive, but though there is a fair amount of surviving documentation, much remains unclear about how they operated. They operated over many different media, but apparently not including pottery or textiles, with the craftsmen or artists apparently a mixture of slaves, especially Persians, captured in war (at least in the early periods), trained Turks, and foreign specialists. They were not necessarily physically located in the palace, and may have been able to undertake work for other clients as well as the sultan. Many specialities were passed from father to son.\n\nOttoman architecture developed traditional Islamic styles, with some technical influences from Europe, into a highly sophisticated style, with interiors richly decorated in coloured tiles, seen in palaces, mosques and turbe mausolea.\n\nOther forms of art represented developments of earlier Islamic art, especially those of Persia, but with a distinct Turkish character. As in Persia, Chinese porcelain was avidly collected by the Ottoman court, and represented another important influence, mainly on decoration. Ottoman miniature and Ottoman illumination cover the figurative and non-figurative elements of the decoration of manuscripts, which tend to be treated as distinct genres, though often united in the same manuscript and page.\n\nThe reign of the Ottomans in the 16th and early 17th centuries introduced the Turkish form of Islamic calligraphy. This art form reached the height of its popularity during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–66). As decorative as it was communicative, Diwani was distinguished by the complexity of the line within the letter and the close juxtaposition of the letters within the word. The hilya is an illuminated sheet with Islamic calligraphy of a description of the Prophet Muhammad. The tughra is an elaborately stylized formal signature of the sultan, which like the hilya performed some of the functions of portraits in Christian Europe. Bookcovers were also elaborately decorated.\n\nOther important media were in the applied or decorative arts rather than figurative work. Pottery, especially İznik pottery, jewellery, hardstone carvings, Turkish carpets, woven and embroidered silk textiles were all produced to extremely high standards, and carpets in particular were exported widely. Other Turkish art ranges from metalwork, carved woodwork and furniture with elaborate inlays to traditional \"Ebru\" or paper marbling.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries Turkish art and architecture became more heavily influenced by contemporary European styles, leading to over-elaborated and fussy detail in decoration. European-style painting was slow to be adopted, with Osman Hamdi Bey (1842-1910) for long a somewhat solitary figure. He was a member of the Ottoman administrative elite who trained in Paris, and painted throughout his long career as a senior administrator and curator in Turkey. Many of his works represent Orientalism from the inside, as it were.\n\nA transition from Islamic artistic traditions under the Ottoman Empire to a more secular, Western orientation has taken place in Turkey. Modern Turkish painters are striving to find their own art forms, free from Western influence. Sculpture is less developed, and public monuments are usually heroic representations of Atatürk and events from the war of independence. Literature is considered the most advanced of contemporary Turkish arts.\n\n\n\n"}

They hold the world hostage in this position and promise to cancel their threats of destroying the Earth only until the world's governments relinquish their power to DAGGER.\n\nA Special Forces Air Unit is called in to attack DAGGER and cripple their strongest defenses and headquarters in New York. Until then, the city remains silent. The organization name was actually changed from the Japanese original Ragnarok.\n\nThe game features 2 players controlling the jet fighters simultaneously for battle across numerous levels. There are 3 types of jets varying from different classes of speeds and firepower. The Silph is the midrange plane with the most balance. While the Valkyrie carries the most firepower, and the Seylen jet is capable of flying at the highest mach speed. Weapon upgrades are available throughout the game, ranging from homing missiles, ring guns, flame throwers and many more. Each jet may also activate the shield manually in times of trouble.\n\nPlayers have a choice between four different standard pick-up weapons:\nVulcan – the player's default weapon which fires straight forward, but can flare out to destroy larger groups of enemies depending on the jet selected.\nBombs – a straight firing, explosive weapon that retains the same firing pattern for all jets, but increases in launch count (number of times it can be fired at once) when upgraded.\nDefender – an explosive cluster-shot weapon that encircles the player's jet and remains the same when upgraded, but increases in count much like the Bombs.\nMissiles – homing missiles that fire from multiple directions of the jet. Similar to the Vulcan, the Missiles fire in different directions depending on the jet that is used.\n\nEvery jet is equipped with a roll device that allows them to kamikaze safely into other jets. The roll must be re-charged after every use. Players also have the choice to pick up the S-Unit, a weapon attachment that empowers the jet's firing no matter what weapon is picked-up previously and every jet's S-Unit attack differs from the others. Once the S-Unit is equipped, the player cannot use their previous weapons unless the S-Unit is detonated. Detonating the S-Unit does not harm the player, but it does harm the enemy as the unit will detonate in a large and powerful explosion.\n\n\"Vapor Trail\" was ported in-house by Data East to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in 1991. This version was published in Japan by Telenet Japan (under the Riot label) and in the United States by its subsidiary Renovation Products. The port was very accurate to the arcade counterpart despite much stricter hardware and color limitations. Even the display ratio was maintained during conversion with the addition of the side bars. This port was also featured on the game show Nick Arcade, in the Video Challenge portion of the show. Sound effects from the game were sampled in the Snazin Smith song \"Doctor Rhino\".\n\nThe game was reviewed in 1992 in \"Dragon\" #178 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.\n\n"}
{"id": "34375832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34375832", "title": "Vorlage", "text": "Vorlage\n\nA Vorlage (; from the German for \"prototype\" or \"template\") is a prior version or manifestation of a text under consideration. It may refer to such a version of a text itself, a particular manuscript of the text, or a more complex manifestation of the text (e.g., a group of copies, or a group of excerpts). Thus, the original-language version of a text which a translator then works into a translation is called the \"Vorlage\" of that translation. For example, the Luther Bible is a translation of the Textus Receptus. So in this case the Textus Receptus is the \"Vorlage\" of the Luther Bible. \n\nSometimes the \"Vorlage\" of a translation may be lost to history. In some of these cases the \"Vorlage\" may be reconstructed from the translation. Such a reconstructed \"Vorlage\" may be called a \"retroversion\", and it invariably is made with some amount of uncertainty. Nevertheless, the \"Vorlage\" may still be reconstructed in some parts at such a level of confidence that the translation and its retroversion can be used as a witness for the purposes of textual criticism. This reconstructed \"Vorlage\" may stand on its own as the sole witness of the original-language text, or it may be compared and used along with other witnesses. Thus, for example, scholars use the reconstructed \"Vorlage\" of the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible at parts to correct the Hebrew Masoretic version when trying to determine oldest version of the Hebrew Bible that they can infer. Or, as another example, the Coptic fragments of Plato's Republic included among the Nag Hammadi library are used to help attest to the original Greek text which Plato himself wrote. For the bulk of the Gospel of Thomas, the \"Vorlage\" exists only as a retroversion of the Coptic translation, as no other witness to the original Greek text for most of the sayings recorded therein is known.\n"}
{"id": "28557692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28557692", "title": "Wise Old Man and Wise Old Woman", "text": "Wise Old Man and Wise Old Woman\n\nIn Carl Jung's theory of analytical psychology, the Wise Old Woman and the Wise Old Man are archetypes of the Collective Unconscious. 'The \"wise old woman\"...[or] helpful \"old woman\" is a well-known symbol in myths and fairy tales for the wisdom of the eternal female nature'. The 'Wise Old Man, or some other very powerful aspect of eternal masculinity' is her male counterpart.\n\nIn Jung's thought, the individuation process was marked by a sequence of archetypes, each acquiring predominance at successive stages, and so reflecting what he termed an ascending psychic scale or 'hierarchy of the unconscious'. Thus, starting with the intermediate position of 'anima or animus...just as the latter have a higher position in the hierarchy than the shadow, so wholeness lays claim to a position and a value superior' still. The Wise Old Woman and Man, as what he termed \"Mana\" personalities or \"supraordinate\" personalities, stood for that wholeness of the self: 'the \"mother\" (\"Primordial Mother\" and \"Earth Mother\") as a supraordinary personality...as the \"self\"'.\n\nAs von Franz put it, 'If an individual has wrestled seriously and long enough with the anima (or animus) problem, so that he, or she, is no longer partially identified with it, the unconscious again changes its dominant character and appears in a new symbolic form representing the Self, the innermost nucleus of the personality. In the dreams of a woman this centre is usually personified as a superior female figure – a priestess, sorceress, earth mother, or goddess of nature or love. In the case of a man, it manifests itself as a masculine initiator and guardian (an Indian \"guru\"), a wise old man, a spirit of nature and so forth'.\n\nThe masculine initiator was described by Jung as 'a figure of the same sex corresponding to the father-imago...the mana-personality [a]s a dominant of the collective unconscious, the recognized archetype of the mighty man in the form of hero, chief, magician, medicine-man, saint, the ruler of men and spirits'. Similarly, 'the wise Old Woman figure represented by Hecate or the Crone ...the Great Mother' stood for an aspect of the mother-imago. The archetypes of the collective unconscious can thus be seen as inner representations of the same-sex parent – as an 'imago built up from parental influences plus the specific reactions of the child'. Consequently, for the Jungian, 'the making conscious of those contents which constitute the archetype of the mana personality signifies therefore \"for the man the second and true liberation from the father, for the woman that from the mother, and therewith the first perception of their own unique individuality\"'.\n\nIn Jung's view, 'all archetypes spontaneously develop favourable and unfavourable, light and dark, good and bad effects'. Thus 'the \"good Wise Man\" must here be contrasted with a correspondingly dark, chthonic figure', and in the same way, the priestess or sibyl has her counterpart in the figure of 'the witch...called by Jung the \"terrible mother\"'. Taken together, male and female, 'The hunter or old magician and the witch correspond to the negative parental images in the magic world of the unconscious'. \n\nBut judgement of such collective archetypes must not be hasty. 'Just as all archetypes have a positive, favourable, bright side that points upwards, so also they have one that points downwards, partly negative and unfavourable, partly chthonic' – so that (for example) 'the sky-woman is the positive, the bear the negative aspect of the \"supraordinate personality\", which extends the conscious human being upwards into the celestial and downwards into the animal regions'. Yet both aspects, celestial and chthonic, were (at least potentially) of equal value for Jung, as he sought for what he termed a \"coniunctio oppositorum\", a union of opposites. 'One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light', he argued, 'but by making the darkness conscious'. Similarly with respect to the goal of the individuation process itself, 'as a totality, the self is a coincidentia oppositorum; it is therefore bright and dark and yet neither'.\n\nComing to terms with the Mana figures of the collective unconscious – with the parental imagos – thus meant overcoming a psychic splitting, so as to make possible an acceptance of 'the Twisted side of the Great Mother'; an acceptance of the way 'the father contains both Kings at once...the Twisted King and the Whole King'.\n\n"}
