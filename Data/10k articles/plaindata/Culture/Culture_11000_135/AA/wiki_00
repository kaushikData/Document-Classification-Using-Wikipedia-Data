One of the key centres for this was the Warburg Institute in London, where scholars like Frances Yates, Edgar Wind, Ernst Cassier, and D. P. Walker began arguing that esoteric thought had had a greater impact on Renaissance culture than had been previously accepted. In 1965, the world's first academic post in the study of esotericism was established at the École pratique des hautes études in the Sorbonne, Paris; named the chair in the History of Christian Esotericism, its first holder was François Secret, a specialist in the Christian Kabbalah. In 1979 the scholar Antoine Faivre assumed Secret's chair at the Sorbonne, which was renamed the \"History of Esoteric and Mystical Currents in Modern and Contemporary Europe\". Faivre has since been cited as being responsible for developing the study of Western esotericism into a formalised field.\n\nFaivre noted that there were two significant obstacles to establishing the field. One was that there was an engrained prejudice towards esotericism within academia, resulting in the widespread perception that the history of esotericism was not worthy of academic research. The second was that esotericism is a trans-disciplinary field, the study of which did not fit clearly within any particular discipline. As Hanegraaff noted, Western esotericism had to be studied as a separate field to religion, philosophy, science, and the arts, because while it \"participates in all these fields\" it does not squarely fit into any of them. \n\nIn 1980, the U.S.-based Hermetic Academy was founded by Robert A. McDermott as an outlet for scholars interested in Western esotericism. From 1986 to 1990 members of the Hermetic Academy participated in panels at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion under the rubric of the \"Esotericism and Perennialism Group\". By 1994, Faivre could comment that the academic study of Western esotericism had taken off in France, Italy, England, and the United States, but he lamented the fact that it had not done so in Germany.\nBy 2008, there were three dedicated university chairs in the subject, at the University of Sorbonne, University of Amsterdam, and the University of Exeter, with the latter two institutions also offering master's degree programs in it.\n\nOn the basis of the fact that \"English culture and literature have been traditional strongholds of Western esotericism\", in 2011 Pia Brînzeu and György Szönyi urged that English studies also have a role in this interdisciplinary field.\n\nThe following Universities have academic chairs in the subject:\n\nSpecific degrees that can be granted include:\n\n\n\n"}

The term was coined in the late 19th century. It was a form of rhetorical exercise \"in which the legitimate methods of the encomium are applied to persons or objects in themselves obviously unworthy of praise, as being trivial, ugly, useless, ridiculous, dangerous or vicious\" — see Arthur S. Pease, \"Things Without Honor\", \"Classical Philology\", Vol. XXI (1926) 27, at 28–9. Pease surveys this field from its origins with the defence of Helen ascribed to Gorgias, and cites De Quincey's \"On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts\" and Lewis Carroll’s \"Through the Looking-Glass\" as modern examples. Pease suggests that the skill was taught in ancient Greece, where the matters known to have been praised included gout, blindness, deafness, old age, negligence, adultery, flies, gnats, bedbugs, smoke, and dung. \n\nThe art was rediscovered during the revival of rhetoric in the 16th century. Among the best known and most influential examples was Erasmus' \"Moriae Encomium\" or \"The Praise of Folly\". \n\nThe first English treatise on the subject was Anthony Munday's \"The defence of contraries\" (1593), a translation of Charles Estienne's \"Paradoxes, ce sont propos contre la commune opinion\" and based on Ortensio Landi's \"Paradossi\". It contained essays that praised, amongst other things, poverty, drunkenness and stupidity. Walter K. Olson, writing in the Leisure & Arts section of the September 8, 2005, edition of \"The Wall Street Journal\", quotes the following passage from Sadakat Kadri, \"The Trial: A History, from Socrates to O.J. Simpson\": \"Elizabethan schoolboys...were commonly taught adoxography, the art of eruditely praising worthless things.\" The passage comes in the course of an account of Sir Walter Raleigh's trial, and Kadri observes that Munday thought lawyers could particularly learn from his book. This was a period of English history when the jury trial was assuming its modern form, and Kadri later shows that the ability to praise apparently worthless causes has been central to courtroom advocacy for centuries. Celebrated adoxographers could therefore be said to include men such as Cicero and Clarence Darrow.\n\nIn modern writing, the term \"adoxography\" is also used as an often humorous self-reference in writing, often in regard to humor columns or blogs.\n"}

This is typically done with hands held shoulder-width apart and at the eye level of the speaker, with the index and middle fingers on each hand flexing at the beginning and end of the phrase being quoted. The air-quoted phrase is—in the most common usage—very short, at most a few words. Air quotes are often used to express satire, sarcasm, irony or euphemism, among others, and are analogous to scare quotes in print.\n\nUse of similar gestures has been recorded as early as 1927, and Glenda Farrell used air quotes in a 1937 screwball comedy, \"Breakfast for Two.\" (Much earlier, in 1889, Lewis Carroll described similar usages -- air brackets and an air question mark -- in his last novel, ). The term \"air quotes\" first appeared in a 1989 \"Spy\" magazine article by Paul Rudnick and Kurt Andersen, who state it became a common gesture around 1980.\n\nThe gesture was used routinely in the TV show \"Celebrity Charades\" (1979) as the standard signal for a quote or phrase.\nIn the episode \"Nurse's Wild\" of TV show \"Emergency!\" (1972), the character Roy DeSoto uses air quotes at Rampart Hospital base station.\n\nThe trend became very popular in the 1990s, attributed by many to comedian Steve Martin, who often used them with exaggerated emphasis in his stand-up shows. Another popularization of air quotes was the character Bennett Brauer, played on the sketch comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\" by Chris Farley, an aggressive but socially awkward commentator who used air quotes to mock societal expectations of him. Additionally, in the blockbuster \"Austin Powers\" film series, Dr. Evil makes exaggerated use of air quotes when explaining matters to his henchmen, particularly while using real phrases he erroneously believes himself to have coined such as \"laser\" and \"Death Star\".\n\nIn the HBO special \"Back in Town\" from 1996, the stand-up comedian George Carlin satirized the use of air quotes in the skit \"Quote Marks in the Air\" from the segment \"Free-Floating Hostility\".\n"}
{"id": "822030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=822030", "title": "Ajam", "text": "Ajam\n\nAjam () is an Arabic word that refers to someone who's mother tongue is not Arabic. During Arab occupation of Persia, the term become a racial pejorative. Colloquially, it now refers to non-Arabs in general.\n\nAccording to traditional etymology, the word \"ʿajam\" comes from the Semitic root aʿ-j-m. Related forms of the same root include, but are not limited to:\n\n\nHomophonous words, which may or may not be derived from the same root, include:\n\nModern use of \"ajam\" has the meaning of \"non-Arab\".\n\nThe verb \"ʿajama\" originally meant \"to mumble, and speak indistinctly\", which is the opposite of \"ʿaraba\", “to speak clearly”. Accordingly, the noun \"ʿujma\", of the same root, is the opposite of \"fuṣḥa\", which means \"chaste, correct, Arabic language\". In general, during the Umayyad period \"Ajam\" was a pejorative term used by Arabs conscious of their social and political superiority, in early history after Islam. However, the distinction between Arab and Ajam is discernible in pre-Islamic poetry.\n\nDuring the Umayyad period, the term developed a derogatory meaning as the word was used to refer to non-Arab speakers (primarily Persians) as illiterate and uneducated. Arab conquerors in that period tried to impose Arabic as the primary language of the subject peoples throughout their empire. Angry with the prevalence of the Persian language in the Divan and Persian society, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ordered the official language of the conquered lands to be replaced with Arabic, sometimes by force (including cutting out the tongues of Persian speakers, further popularising the term \"mute\"). Persian resistance to this mentality was popularised in the final verse of Ferdowsi's \"Shahnameh\"; this verse is widely regarded by Iranians as the primary reason that they speak Persian and not Arabic to this day. Under the Umayyad dynasty, official association with the Arab dominion was only given to those with the ethnic identity of the Arab and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status (mawālī, another derogatory term translated to mean \"slave\" or \"lesser\" in this context).\n\nAccording to Clifford Edmund Bosworth, \"by the 3rd/9th century, the non-Arabs, and above all the Persians, were asserting their social and cultural equality (\"taswīa\") with the Arabs, if not their superiority (\"tafżīl\") over them (a process seen in the literary movement of the Šoʿūbīya). In any case, there was always in some minds a current of admiration for the ʿAǰam as heirs of an ancient, cultured tradition of life. Even the great proponent of the Arab cause, Jāḥeẓ, wrote a \"Ketāb al-taswīa bayn al-ʿArab wa’l-ʿAǰam\". After these controversies had died down, and the Persians had achieved a position of power in the Islamic world comparable to their numbers and capabilities, \"ʿAjam\" became a simple ethnic and geographical designation.\". Thus by the ninth century, the term was being used by Persians themselves as an ethnic term, and examples can be given by Asadi Tusi in his poem comparing the superiority of Persians and Arabs.\nAccordingly: \"territorial notions of “Iran,” are reflected in such terms as irānšahr, irānzamin, or Faris, the Arabicized form of Pārs/Fārs (Persia). The ethnic notion of “Iranian” is denoted by the Persian words Pārsi or Irāni, and the Arabic term Ahl Faris (inhabitants of Persia) or ʿAjam, referring to non-Arabs, but primarily to Persians as in molk-e ʿAjam (Persian kingdom) or moluk-e ʿAjam (Persian kings).\".\n\nAccording to \"The Political Language of Islam\", during the Islamic Golden Age, 'Ajam' was used colloquially as a reference to denote those whom Arabs in the Arabian Peninsula viewed as \"alien\" or outsiders. The early application of the term included all of the \"non-Arab \"peoples with whom the Arabs had contact including Persians, Byzantine Greeks, Ethiopians, Armenians, Assyrians, Mandaeans, Arameans, Jews, Georgians, Sabians, Samaritans, Egyptians, Berbers and the related Nabataeans (despite being the originators of the first Arab identifying people).\n\nDuring the early age of the Caliphates, Ajam was often synonymous with \"foreigner\" or \"stranger\". In the Western Asia, it was generally applied to the Persians, while in al-Andalus it referred to speakers of Romance languages - becoming \"Aljamiado\" in Spanish in reference to Arabic-script writing of those languages - and in West Africa refers to the Ajami script or the writing of local languages such as Hausa and Fulani in the Arabic alphabet. In Zanzibar \"ajami\" and \"ajamo\" means Persian which came from the Persian Gulf and the cities of Shiraz and Siraf. In Turkish, there are many documents and letters that used Ajam to refer to Persian. \n\nIn the Persian Gulf region today, people still refer to Persians as Ajami, referring to Persian carpets as \"sajjad al Ajami\" (Ajami carpet), Persian cat as Ajami cats, and Persian Kings as Ajami kings.\n\n\n"}

The name comes from \"vehículos de transporte colectivo\" (\"vehicles for collective transport\"), reflecting their origin as shared taxis.\n\nWhen they first appeared in the 1920s, \"colectivos\" were small buses built out of smaller vehicle chassis (cars, vans, etc.) and, later, out of truck chassis (1950–1990, by Mercedes-Benz Argentina), not specifically designed for the transportation of people, and were decorated with unique hand-painted drawings (\"fileteado\") that gave each unit a distinct flavor.\n\nThey steadily evolved and grew larger, but kept their picturesque style until the 1990s, when the urban fleet was modernized with standard rear-engined bus units.\n\nDuring most of their history, tickets were sold by the driver, who would drive off as soon as all passengers had boarded, selling tickets while driving.\n\nTaxi-bus, Chevrolet Double Phaeton, creation of the \"líneas\"\n\nIn the 1900s Argentina was the \"Granary of the World\", one of the largest world food producers and exporters, and a wealthy country. The streets of prosperous Buenos Aires (with 2 million inhabitants) soon filled with cars.\nCommercial relations with the United Kingdom (mainly trade in meat and grain), also brought a myriad of investors and enterprises in the early years of the century, including Latin America's first metro system, cars, trains, tramways, taxis and public buses.\nOn 24 September 1928, the first taxi-bus ran through Buenos Aires. Later called \"colectivo\", it was based on an Argentine-manufactured longer-wheelbase Chevrolet Superior K-series Double Phaeton called \"Especial Argentino\". It provided public transportation throughout Buenos Aires on pre-defined itineraries and stops, charging a low price for each passenger.\n\nChevrolet started manufacturing a truck chassis adaptable to passenger transport. By the 1930s the size of the colectivo had increased from five to up to a dozen seats, and the Chevrolet line had become widely used, with bodies made by local companies. This style was kept until the 1970s and 1980s, by which time the units had twenty seats plus cramped room for many standing passengers.\n\nDuring its heyday, drivers deliberately challenged the \"real\" public buses and electric tramways, parking near them at the busiest stations and driving close to them during the day to pick up their passengers. Soon people started to prefer these \"colectivos\", which displaced the original buses and trams.\n\nWith time the routes were formalized, and owners of \"colectivos\" joined together into lines that operated standard routes, distinguished by numbers displayed on the \"colectivos\". Since several lines often traversed the same roads, companies began to adopt different colors to distinguish their units more clearly than by the number alone. Line 60, a particularly well-known line with a long route, had its beginnings in this era.\n\nMercedes-Benz truck and buses\n\nAfter World War II and during the 1950s Argentine industry started to develop again, but the country's public transport system was inadequate for the new era: practically no modernization had taken place since the early years, and the suburban railway system was not sufficient to meet the rising demands of the population.\n\nMercedes-Benz moved into the \"colectivo\" market: in 1951 the then Daimler-Benz AG set up in Argentina its first factories outside Germany: one in the town of San Martín, near Buenos Aires, and another in González Catán.\n\nMercedes released updated local colectivo chassis, a modified L 3500 truck chassis – LO 3500, OP 3500, LO 311, LO 312, LO 911 (the [O] stands for Omnibus) – with a separately manufactured body fitted later by different coachbuilders. In less than a decade the output was 6,500 units a year. In 1963 Mercedes built the 10,000nd colectivo (model LO 312), and continued with other models, such as L 1112 (120 HP), LA 1112 (all-wheel traction) and the L 1114. The Mercedes-Benz colectivos had truck powerplants, a diesel engine with power transmitted to the rear axle by a five-speed constant-mesh gearbox.\n\nAll the lines progressively adopted these units and, from 1950 to 1990, all colectivos were eventually Mercedes-Benz models.\n\nOmnibus. Blurring of the tradition of the colectivo\n\nIn 1987 El Detalle, one of the bus body suppliers of Mercedes-Benz, started competing with its former chassis provider, investing in low price and modern urban buses, with cheaper Deutz engines. That same year model El Detalle OA-101 was launched. This model was rear-engined and had pneumatic suspension, providing smoother rides and more inside space.\nMercedes-Benz responded the following year with the rear-engined OH-1314, but that was considered \"the death of the Colectivo\", certainly the end of an era.\n\nIn 1989 the last truck-based colectivos, on the classic Mercedes-Benz chassis LO-1114, were assembled. Production had been discontinued the previous year.\nDuring the 1990s some companies found it cheaper to switch to single-colored units, and a flurry of mergers and foldings changed the appearance of colectivos.\n\nNowadays, only the three-digit numbering and some of the routes survive from the traditional \"líneas\", \"fileteado\" is rarely seen, the \"filigranas\" were lost, and some of the classic big details, such as the panoramic mirrors close to the driver's head, disappeared.\nAfter 1995 automatic ticket machines made journeys safer, since drivers did not have to sell tickets and drive at the same time.\n\nIn 2005 Mercedes-Benz units accounted for about half of the buses in the city of Buenos Aires and its surroundings, with units built in Buenos Aires (La Favorita, Eivar, Italbus, Bimet-Corwin, Galicia, CND, CEAP, Ugarte, etc.) and in Brazil (Marcopolo, CAIO and others). The other half were El Detalle units and others such as Scania, Volvo, Dimex, Zanello and very few Ferroni.\n\nMost older units have been retired from service in Buenos Aires, as they are considered too dangerous and noisy for use in the fast-paced city. They were disposed of, or sent to smaller cities all over the country. Colectivos are usually retired only when they are too damaged to be repaired; some of them have “resuscitated” as fine motorhomes.\n\nThe Mercedes units were more sophisticated than the original \"taxi-bus\" but the body kept its artistic touches, preserving the original style of the \"colectivo\". This style was not influenced by the social class of the districts through which the \"colectivos\" journeyed. All the units of all the \"líneas\" shared these characteristics until the 1990s:\nDecorators used many colorful combinations over the units' external body, helping identify each one of the \"líneas\". These eventually evolved into \"corporate colors\": when one company ran several lines, they painted buses on all lines in the same colors. Until the 1990s the \"fileteado\", individual to each bus, was maintained.\n\n\"Fileteado\" has been defined as: \"art on wheels\": full of colored ornaments and symmetries completed with poetic phrases, sayings and aphorisms, both humorous or roguish, emotional or philosophical\".\nThe colectivos were where this art found its best canvas. Long, wide mirrors placed around the driver seat often had winding drawings and motifs that usually portrayed the driver's preferences in football, religion and tango.\nThe outside of the units was also painted with \"fileteado\" details, flower motifs, national flags, and football team banners. It was also very common to see phrases written down in complex fonts, usually at the back. These phrases were often ingenious puns or rhymes and became part of Argentine folklore. A simple example of a very common phrase is: \"Lo mejor que hizo la vieja es el pibe que maneja\" (loosely \"The best thing my mum did was this bus-driving kid\").\n\nThe units with a larger budget had more details added around the driver's seat. These usually came in the form of lights of exotic colors or seat covers with wool and fringes or even leather. It was very common to see the gear-stick full of hanging knickknacks and the casing where the tickets and coins were stored covered with motifs.\n\nBefore 1995 tickets were sold by the \"colectivero\" (driver) as he drove; they were colored strips of paper with a 5-digit number. Palindromic numbers (such as \"10301\") were called \"capicuas\" (from Catalan \"cap i cua\", \"head and tail\") and sometimes collected.\n\nThe colectivo bus operations of Buenos Aires provide a widespread and frequent bus service that attracts exceptionally high ridership with virtually no public financial support beyond subsidized petrol to keep fares low.\n\nWith low ticket prices, very frequent services, and extensive routes, with many places within 400m of a route, the colectivo is a very widely used mode of transportation around the city. \"Porteños\" (Autonomous City of Buenos Aires' residents) have a love-hate relationship with the colectivo: on the one hand, they are usually very crowded in rush hour and plagued with pickpockets, petty thieves, beggars and hawkers (itinerant salesmen), though more controlled nowadays. On the other hand, they are a necessity in the city, and a convenient and cheap way to get around. Most colectivos in the big cities of Argentina do not have a fixed timetable, but run at least four, and often many more, services per hour, depending on the bus line and time of day. During night-time, all colectivos in Buenos Aires city run through their stops at least twice an hour.\n\nMost buses share a basic distance-dependent fare system. the \"universal\" fare in pesos was:\n\n\nSection boundaries are fixed at about 3 km from each other (less so near the city center), so that a 4-kilometer ride may sometimes require to pay the second rate.\n\nFares are valid for one bus ride, with no transfer facility.\n\nSome lines operate a number of \"diferencial\" (premium) buses, with no need to stand and with other amenities, for example curtains, at a higher price.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1147906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1147906", "title": "Davul", "text": "Davul\n\nThe davul or atabal or tabl is a large double-headed drum that is played with mallets. It has many names depending on the country and region. These drums are commonly used in the music of Middle East . These drums have both a deep bass sound and a thin treble sound due to their construction and playing style, where different heads and sticks are used to produce different sounds on the same drum.\n\nSome names of davuls include:\n\n\nOther Greek names for this drum include Davouli, Argano, Toskani, Tsokani, Toubi, Toubaki, Kiossi, Tavouli, Pavouli, Toubano, and Toubaneli. Additionally, other names for the daouli, depending on the area, include toumpano, tymbano, or toumbi, which stem from the ancient Greek word tympano; this word exists in English in the word tympani for the drum section in the modern classical orchestra and the tympanic membrane for the eardrum.\n\nIn the southern Balkans, the rhythm of the tapan is complex and utilizes many accents in numerous traditional time signatures. In Macedonia, tapans are most often used to accompany other instruments such as the zurla and gaida, while in Bulgaria they usually accompany gaida and gadulka. They are also played solo in some Albanian, Bulgarian and Macedonian folk dances and songs. For centuries the tapan is irreplaceable at Bulgarian village festivities such as weddings and celebrations of patron saints of homes and villages. In Romania and Moldova the toba is sometimes used to accompany dances. In the regions of Moldavia, Maramures and Bihor there are also some varieties with a small cymbal mounted on top. They are generally struck with a wooden mallet on one skin and with a thinner stick on the rim or cymbal.\n\nIn Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia, the davul is most commonly played with the zurna, although it can be played with other instruments and in ensembles as well. It has also traditionally been used for communication and for Turkish mehter, or janissary music. In Iraq and the Levant, it is predominantly used in Assyrian folk dance and Assyrian folk/pop music, among Assyrian people, which are mostly accompanied by a zurna, a wind instrument. In Armenia the dhol does not have as large of a circumference and is usually played with the hands, although a wooden, spoon-shaped drumstick is also used. It is frequently heard in Armenian folk music. Not only is it in folk music but also in modern music as well, even having solos in many prominent songs.\n\nThe drum shell is made of hard wood, perhaps walnut or chestnut, though many woods may be in use depending on the region where the drum is made. To make the shell, the wood is boiled in water to make it bendable, and then it is bent into a cylindrical shape and fastened together. The heads are usually goat skin, and they are shaped into circles by wooden frames. However, one head may be goat skin to provide a higher tone, while the other head can be sheepskin, calfskin, or even donkey-skin to provide a lower tone. Some say that wolf skin and even dog skin are preferred. Rope threaded back and forth across the shell of the drum, from head to head in a zigzag pattern, holds the heads on the drum and provides tension for tuning the drum. Sometimes metal rings or leather straps join neighboring strands of the rope in order to allow for further tuning. Two rings are sometimes attached to the main rope where a belt-like rope is threaded through to hold the drum.\n\nIn the former Yugoslavian republics and Bulgaria, the tapan is made in two dimensions, , at about 50 – 55 cm diameter, and or tapanche, at about 30 – 35 cm diameter.\n\nIn Turkey, davuls typically range in size from 60 cm to 90 cm in diameter. Cow hide is used for the bass pitch drum head side, while goat skin is used for the thin, high pitched side.\n\nIn Greece, daouli can be 12 to 14 inches for the toumbi up to 3 to 4 feet for daouli. Commonly the drum is about 20 to 30 inches.\n\nPlayers often use a rope hooked to the drum to hold the drum sideways, so that one head is accessible with the left hand and one with the right. Each hand is usually dedicated to playing one side of the drum exclusively, though this can vary by local style and tradition.\n\nDrummers of this drum typically uses two kinds of sticks. The drummer plays the accented beats with the dominant hand on the side of the drum with the thicker skin, using a special stick known as the , , or (daouli stick). This stick is a thick pipe-like stick about 440 mm long, which is often made with walnut. Its thick shape as well as the thickness of the head give the accented beats a low, full sound. Sometimes the drumhead played with the thick stick is also muted with a cloth to enhance the fundamental low note of the drum. Unaccented beats are played by the nondominant hand on the side of the drum having the thin skin, using a thin stick or switch called , , or (daouli switch). This thin stick is often held cross-grip, and the drummer can quickly hit thin accent strokes by gently twisting the wrist. These thin sticks are often made from soft wood such as willow or cornel.\n\nThe Balkan school of tapan playing presumes the playing (not the accompaniment) of a melody, where the non-dominant hand is used to express all that the player wishes to say, while the dominant hand is only used to accentuate certain moments in the melody.\n\nThe Australian drummer Chris Mitrevski pioneered a hybrid style of playing, relying on multiple accented notes played by the non-dominant hand. This style is difficult to play but results in a very complex poly-rhythm, with the dominant hand accenting the down beat.\n\n\n"}

Stating that \"mortuary practices can be conceptualised as strategies for remembering and forgetting\", he discusses the influence of sociology. and anthropology on his study before exploring the Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Swallowcliffe Down. Chapter two, \"Objects of memory\", examines the inclusion of grave goods in Early Medieval burials, among them jewellery and weaponry, emphasising the mnemonic effects that these might have had on those attending the funeral. In \"Remembering through the body\", Williams examines mnemonic elements to the manner in which the corpse was prepared before cremation or inhumation, resulting in its burial.\n\nChapter four, \"Graves as mnemonic compositions\", argued that Early Medieval graves were \"mnemonic performances aimed at constructing the present in relation to the past and future.\" Looking at the sequence of scenes that onlookers would have witnessed, it discusses graves and grave structures, before using Snape, Sutton Hoo, and the northern cist burials, as case studies.\n\nThe fifth chapter, \"Monuments and memory\", focuses on the way in which cairns and burial mounds were erected to commemorate the death, also looking at ring ditches and Pictish symbol stones. \"Death and landscape\" takes a wider view of the relation between Early Medieval burials and the wider landscape, discussing the reuse of prehistoric monuments, and the relation between burials and routeways, settlements, and significant natural places. Highlighting that not all Early Medieval burials are in cemeteries, Williams looks to literary evidence from land charters and \"Beowulf\" to theorise mortuary landscapes.\n\nLeslie Webster of the British Museum reviewed the tome for the peer-reviewed journal \"Antiquity\". Describing it as a \"excellent book\", she welcomed it as the \"first extended study\" into how the dead were remembered in Early Medieval British society. Although noting that churches, domestic architecture, and stone monuments were not discussed, she believed that Williams used sufficient evidence to illustrate his \"firm command\" of the subject. Praising the presentation of the evidence and the \"particularly elegant\" illustrations, she believed that he would have benefitted from including information on the Prittlewell Prince burial, Franks Casket, and a wider array of contemporary literary sources. More critically, she noted the existence of several typos in the text, believing that it could have benefited from a \"firmer editorial hand\", and believed that its \"textbook style\" made the work difficult to read at points.\n\nIn the \"Time and Mind\" journal, George Nash reviewed Williams' book.\n"}

The story is about a 10th-century Muslim Arab who travels with a group of Vikings to their settlement.\n\nCrichton explains in an appendix that the book was based on two sources. The first three chapters are a retelling of Ahmad ibn Fadlan's personal account of his actual journey north and his experiences with and observations of Vikings (probably from Sweden). The remainder is based upon the story of \"Beowulf\".\n\nThe novel is set in the 10th century. The Caliph of Baghdad, Al-Muqtadir, sends his ambassador, Ahmad ibn Fadlan, to the king of the Volga Bulgars. He never arrives but is instead conscripted by a group of Vikings to take part in a hero's quest to the north. Ahmad ibn Fadlan is taken along as the thirteenth member of their group to comply with a soothsayer's requirement for success. There they battle with the 'mist-monsters', or 'wendol', a tribe of vicious savages (suggested by the narrator to have been possibly relict Neanderthals) who go to battle wearing bear skins.\n\n\"Eaters of the Dead\" is narrated as a scientific commentary on an old manuscript. The narrator describes how the story told is a composite of extant commentaries and translations of the works of the original story teller. There are several references during the narration to a possible change or mistranslation of the original story by later copiers. The story is told by several different voices: the editor/narrator, the translators of the script and the original author, ibn Fadlan, as well as his descriptions of stories told by others. A sense of authenticity is supported by occasional explanatory footnotes with references to a mixture of factual and fictitious sources.\n\nIn an afterword in the novel Crichton gives a few comments on its origin. A good friend of Crichton's was giving a lecture on the \"Bores of Literature\". Included in his lecture was an argument on \"Beowulf\" and why it was simply uninteresting. Crichton stated his views that the story was not a bore and was, in fact, a very interesting work. The argument escalated until Crichton stated that he would prove to him that the story could be interesting if presented in the correct way.\n\nIn a seemingly offhand reference, Abdul Alḥaẓred's \"Necronomicon\" (of H. P. Lovecraft fame) is quoted in the in-character bibliography.\n\nThe critic from the \"New York Times\" called it \"diverting but disappointing\". The \"Chicago Tribune\" said it was \"funny, fascinating and informative\".\n\nIn 1979 it was announced the movie version of the novel would be made by the newly formed Orion Pictures with Crichton himself to direct. This did not occur.\n\nThe novel was adapted into film as \"The 13th Warrior\" (1999), directed by John McTiernan and released by Walt Disney Pictures through its Touchstone banner. Crichton himself did some uncredited directing for a reshoot after Disney fired McTiernan for various reasons, one of which was going far over budget. Antonio Banderas played Ibn Fadlan. Crichton writes that he was \"quite pleased\" with the film, though it earned mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box office, earning about $62 million worldwide; the film's budget was more than $100 million.\n\n"}

The project has a voluntary student membership basis and is concentrated in rural, mainly underdeveloped areas of the country.\n\nTeam leadership and student involvement interchange on an annual basis with the start of a new academic year. The project is supported by a board of Alumni members.\n\nAs a result of the large magnitude earthquakes that killed at least 844 people, students from Imperial College London's Civil Engineering Department volunteered to work on a development project from 2002 onwards, to be concentrated in the country's poorest communities over subsequent academic years.\n\nStudents from several universities and disciplines have travelled along to El Salvador and worked with the relevant community for 5 to 7 weeks on various development projects. The typical student intake over a particular year varies between 11-13.\n\nCommunities helped by the El Salvador Project: Estanzuelas, Usulután (2002), San Emigdio, La Paz (2003, 2004, 2005), Santa Marta, San Vicente (2006, 2007), Colima, Cuscatlán (2009)\n\nThe project receives most of its finance from company sponsors. From the appointment of a particular year's members to the end of the relevant academic year the student body is further involved in fundraising events, which in the past has included evening sales and a marathon style run in the Netherlands.\nOn 17 April 2009 the project competed in the JP Morgan Good Venture Case competition in New York City, where it won $25,000 to fund its activities.\n\nOn 2 December 2009 the project secured a further $15,000 from JP Morgan's online global Give-it-Away competition.\n\nThis year's project was based in the community of Colima in the Department of Cuscatlán. Two reinforced earthquake resistant houses were constructed, in addition to a retaining wall. The design of the houses was presented by the Reconstruction and Development Organization of El Salvador (REDES), a national NGO which works closely with the project and oversees the construction process.\n\nIn association with the British Geological Survey seismologists from among others the Department of Civil Engineering of Imperial College London predict an increasing risk posed by earthquakes in El Salvador in the near future due to rapid population expansion exacerbated by deforestation.\n\nIn reaction to the floods and landslides in November 2009 that left at least 192 people dead, REDES will likely be appointing a specifically badly struck geographical entity for consideration under the 2010 project.\n\nPlans for future improvement that are currently awaiting approval include the expansion of a particular year's activities to cover more than one community, spreading out the construction work by sending over teams outside the summer term period and expansion of the concept of the project to cover communities in the neighbouring countries of Guatemala and Honduras.\n\nThe 2014 project will involve the project team travelling to Guatemala for the first time. A house design developed in conjunction with Arup will be tested on an earthquake simulator at the University Mariano Galvez in Guatemala City. The team will then construct a second house within a community in El Salvador.\n\n"}

Where other types of tourism are often passive in nature, enotourism can consist of visits to wineries, tasting wines, vineyard walks, or even taking an active part in the harvest.\nEnotourism is a relatively new form of tourism. Its history varies greatly from region to region, but in places such as the Napa Valley AVA and Wine Country, it saw heavy growth once a concerted marketing effort was implemented in 1975 that was given a further boost by the 1976 Judgment of Paris.\n\nOther regions, such as Catalonia, Spain have only started marketing enotourism starting in the mid-2000s, primarily focusing on how it is an alternative form of tourism to the beach for which Spain is overall known.\n\nThere was also a rise in the profile of enotourism among English speakers with the 2004 release of the film, Sideways whose two central characters visit wineries and wine in the Santa Barbara region of Southern California.\n\nThe industry around enotourism has grown significantly throughout the first decade of the 21st century. In the United States 27 million travelers, or 17% of American leisure travelers, engaged in culinary or wine-related activities. In Italy the figure stands at approximately five million travelers, generating 2.5 billion euros in revenue.\n\nA private initiative by Recevin holds an annual \"Enotourism Day\" on the second Sunday of November each year to promote cellar visits in Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Spain, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, and Portugal. In North America, the first Wine Tourism Day was established for May 11, 2013 with events scheduled throughout the continent.\n\nChile has grown its enotourism industry in recent years, with several tourist routes being opened throughout the country, with several of them offering overnight accommodations.\n\nMost visits to the wineries take place at or near the site where the wine is produced. Visitors typically learn the history of the winery, see how the wine is made, and then taste the wines. At some wineries, staying in a small guest house at the winery is also offered. Many visitors buy the wines made by the winery at the premises, accounting for up to 33% of their annual sales.\n\nVery small, low production regions such as Priorat, Catalonia focus on small, intimate visits with the owner as the host and include walks through the vineyards to help visitors understand the unique qualities of the region.\n\nMore elaborate tastings can include horizontal and vertical tastings as well as full meals focused upon showcasing the wines.\n\nAs the enotourism industry matures, additional activities have been added to visits such as riding electrically assisted bicycles, called, \"burricleta\".\n\nMost tourism agencies see it as a segment of the industry with tremendous growth potential, stating that in some regions, it's only functioning at 20% of its full potential.\n\nAs enotourism grows, regions such as Napa Valley have to deal with continued success and the effects that come with it, such as crowds and increased tasting room fees. This can, in turn have the opposite effect desired wherein potential visitors are driven away and turned off enotourism.\n\nValduga, V. (2014).

The book became \"perhaps the most influential justification for firing Communists and suspected Communists from university and schools in the early 1950s\" during McCarthyism.\n\nThe book began as a full-page article in the \"New York Times\" weekend magazine called \"Heresy, Yes–But Conspiracy, No,\" published on July 9, 1950.\n\nAfter formation of the American Committee for Cultural Freedom, spearheaded by Hook, he had the group publish a 29-page pamphlet with the slightly varied title \"Heresy, Yes–Conspiracy, No!\".)\n\nHook dedicated the book to :\n\nThe book's comprise a number of essay written by Hook between 1950 (the original article) and the book's May 1953 publication date. Hook had published various chapters earlier in the \"New York Times\", \"Commentary\", the \"Journal of Philosophy\", and the \"Journal of Higher Education\", the \"American Mercury\", \"School and Society\" (1939-1946,a journal edited by William Bagley (educator)), the \"Saturday Evening Post\", and the \"New Leader\".\n\n(Possible or same-name sources, derived from cross-check with Hook's papers, appear below in parentheses):\n\nHook sets out to deal with academic freedom, a topic \"bound to displease two articulate groups whose influence is out of all proportion to their numbers\":\n\nCompounding conflicts between these two groups, Hook notes, are government officials who suffer from either \"mediocre intelligence\" or the \"most extraordinary of the nature of the international Communist movement,\" an example of whose decisions are the Truman Doctrine (i.e., Hook is criticizing New Deal/Fair Deal officials under Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman).\n\nHook divided the book into two parts, each of which begins with quotes from his choice of most relevant examples:\n\nHook concludes: The chief evil from which the schools suffer is not communism but community neglect, and the failure to make the common and special needs of the individual personality their supreme concern. Whatever the responsibilities of the schools to a democratic society, the responsibilities of a democratic society to its schools are more basic and more numerous. These responsibilities have not been adequately discharged. The need for more schools and better schools, more teachers and better teachers and better-paid teachers, grows. The perennial need for educational thinking, for a continuously held philosophy of education, has become more acute in the long war for survival and freedom into which we have already entered. The task of American educators is to integrate the insights of liberal thinks from Socrates to John Dewey, as well as the insights born of wider scientific knowledge, into a coherent philosophy to make the \"practice\" of education meaningful, excellent, joyful, and free.\n\nIn 1953, Robert E. Fitch wrote in \"Commentary\" that Hook's book showed \"balance and reasonableness\" and also its \"courage\" for including teachers themselves in its criticisms. It includes a \"sharp indictment\" of the American Association of University Professors' Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure for what Fitch calls its \"failure to cope realistically with the problem of Communist infiltration.\" Fitch agrees with Hook that Communist affiliation means \"active participation in a conspiracy\" and thereby renders a teacher \"unfit\" to teach. He notes Hook's assertion that \"college and university teachers constituted the strongest and most influential group of Communist fellow-travelers in the United States\" and agrees with Hook's recommendation that such teachers receive individual care and consideration.\n\nIn 1980, Victor Navasky acknowledged Hook as the \"most articulate proponent\" of the \"doctrine of conspiracy\" of the Communist Party USA. He called the book a \"bible for liberals unwilling to fight for the rights of Communists.\"\n\nIn 1997, Christopher Phelps wrote, \"Hook was a leading figure in the creation of a repressive, censorious atmosphere in higher education, carried out, naturally, under the guise of cultural freedom.\" Further, he stated that his book \"became perhaps the most influential justification for firing Communists and suspected Communists from university and schools in the early 1950s...\" He noted that, despite an effort at even-handedness, in fact Hook sided with \"Cultural Vigilantes\" and wound up criticizing them not for their understanding of Communism but their \"blundering methods\" of eradicating it from school.\n\nIn 2004, Matthew J. Cotter argued appreciation for the nuance of Hook's position. Hook had recommended suspension, not removal of teachers once their Part membership become known, followed by inquiry. However, Cotter challenges Hook's \"exaggerated sense of threat posed by Communist conspiracy among American teachers. If one accepts Hook's premise that Communist conspiracy did involve some American teachers, then Cotter deemed Hook's approach to have \"no democratic failing.\" Hook clearly called for a third of four steps in his process of inquiry, such that \"prima facie\" evidence of Communist Party membership should not result in automatic dismissal.\" In this analysis, Cotter notes his own agreement with similar findings by Robert Talisse.\n\nIn 2015, Edward S. Shapiro commented, \"The bulk of Hook's writings in the 1950s, most notably \"Heresy, Yes–\nConspiracy, No!\" (1953), sought to undo the damage done by McCarthyism.\"\n\nIn his memoir \"Out of Step\", Hook wrote \"Even though I believed that membership in the [CP] rendered an individual unfit... to be a member of the teaching staff, I did \"not\" believe that the mere fact of membership should result in automatic dismissal.\"\n\n"}

The center is named after Heydar Aliyev, the first secretary of Soviet Azerbaijan from 1969 to 1982, and president of Azerbaijan Republic from October 1993 to October 2003.\n\nThe Center houses a conference hall (auditorium), a gallery hall and a museum. The project is intended to play an integral role in the intellectual life of the city. Located close to the city center, the site plays a pivotal role in the redevelopment of Baku.\n\nThe Heydar Aliyev Center represents a fluid form which emerges by the folding of the landscape's natural topography and by the wrapping of individual functions of the Center. All functions of the Center, together with entrances, are represented by folds in a single continuous surface. This fluid form gives an opportunity to connect the various cultural spaces whilst at the same time, providing each element of the Center with its own identity and privacy. As it folds inside, the skin erodes away to become an element of the interior landscape of the Center.\n\nHeydar Aliyev Center had an official soft-opening ceremony on 10 May 2012 held by current president of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev.\n\nAn internationally recognized architectural work, the building of the Heydar Aliyev Center has become a signature landmark of modern Baku due to its innovative and cutting-edge design. Extending on eight floor levels, the center accommodates a 1000-seat auditorium, temporary exhibition spaces, a conference center, workshops, and a museum.\nThe building was nominated for awards in 2013 at both the World Architecture Festival and the biennial Inside Festival.\n\nIn 2007, Zaha Hadid was appointed as the design architect of the Center after a competition. In 2014, the Center won the Design Museum's Design of the Year Award 2014 despite concerns about the site's human rights record. This makes Zaha Hadid the first woman to win the top prize in that competition.\n\nThe building was featured in \"Extreme Engineering\", a documentary television series that airs on the Discovery Channel and the Science Channel. The episode called \"Azerbaijan's Amazing Transformation\" was aired on April 22, 2011 as part of Season 9. The Building was also featured on the \"postcard\" of Samra Rahimli for the postcard of Azerbaijan at the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 and in a Google Doodle in 2017.\n\nOn June 29, 2012, the Heydar Aliyev Center held the official opening of Crans Montana Forum, attended by President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili, President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, President of Montenegro Filip Vujanovic, as well as foreign public figures, MPs, intellectuals, and business circles.\n\nOn July 3, 2012, the Center held the ceremony of the official seeing-off of the Azerbaijani delegation to take part in the XXX Summer Olympic Games in London. The ceremony was attended by the President Republic of Azerbaijan, President of the National Olympic Committee Ilham Aliyev and his spouse Mehriban Aliyeva. Photo banners reflecting the Olympic movement in Azerbaijan were installed in the lobby of the Heydar Aliyev Center. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev made a speech at the ceremony.\n\nOn 20 July 2012, a fire started on the roof of the building at about 11:30am. It was quickly put out by firemen, and it was initially reported that the fire only damaged the roof of the building, leaving the interior only slightly damaged, mainly because of the water used by firemen to extinguish the fire. The fire was found to have resulted from negligence in the use of welding equipment in the roof; three Turkish contractors were subsequently charged under Azerbaijan's criminal code. The resulting damage was found to have had \"grave consequences and material damage on a large scale\". Subsequent to sixteen months of repairs, it was formally (re)opened on November 5, 2013.\n\nOn Nov. 2 and 3, 2013, Moscow music theater “Helikon-Opera” under the direction of People's Artist of Russia Dmitry Bertmann presented performances at the Heydar Aliyev Center. On Nov. 2, the “Helikon-Opera” presented a gala concert “The Enduring Love”, a program that included lyric songs by Marilyn Monroe, Tina Turner, Elton John, Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, “The Beatles”, with “All You Need is Love”, “I believe in Love”,”Je Suis Malade”, “Only You”, “Lady in Red”, “Love me Tender” performed. On Nov.3, the artists of the theater performed the opera “Siberia” by the Italian composer Umberto Giordano staged by Dmitry Bertmann. The opera narrates the story of love between two young people, which starts at brilliant imperial St. Petersburg and ends tragically in hard labor in Siberia.\n\nOn June 21, 2013, the Center held the opening of the exhibition of works by American artist Andy Warhol titled “Life, Death, and Beauty” supervised by Gianni Mercurio, dated for the 85th anniversary of the artist. The exhibition, taking place first ever in Azerbaijan, displayed over one hundred works by the artist, including featurettes by Warhol. There were shown photos of the author, portraits of the world film, music, and fashion stars, as well as other world-renowned works, with \"Flowers\" \"Camouflage\", “The Last Supper”, “Male Hands Praying”, “Electric Chair”, etc. On August 6, the artist's birthday, Baku residents and visitors could freely visit the exhibition, which ran till September 9.\n\nOn October 1, 2013, the Heydar Aliyev Center held a personal exhibition of the People's Artist of Azerbaijan, vice- president of the Russian Academy of Arts Tahir Salakhov titled “At the turn of the century”. The exhibition was dated for the 85th anniversary of the artist. His great contribution to the development of the Azerbaijani fine art was highlighted at the exhibition opening. The artistic heritage of Tahir Salakhov is an integral part of the art of not only Azerbaijan, but also the entire former Soviet Union. He is recognized as one of the founders of the “severe style” in painting. The exhibition featured over 100 works by the artist, created at different times, and his works on the carpets. There are portraits of Heydar Aliyev, the composer Gara Garayev and Dmitri Shostakovich, the musician Mstislav Rostropovich, the works “Aidan”, “Morning. Absheron”,”Koroglu”, Absheron triptych – “Atyashgyah”, “The Caspian today”, “Maiden Tower”, and other well-known works of the people’s artist. The exhibition ran till November 8.\n\nIn 2017 the center has also opened its doors to the Contemporary Turkish Art Exhibition,a collection of art pieces by various Turkish artists.\n\nThe Heydar Aliyev Center maintains close ties with a number of international agencies, peer structures abroad, museums and exhibition centers. The Center has organized events and exhibitions as a result of joint cooperation with different organization,museums and exhibitions of Austria, Belgium, Great Britain, France, Italy, Russia, Slovenia, Turkey and so on. At the same time, it has conducted a number of projects in Great Britain,Israel,Italy,Hungary,Romania,Russia,Turkey,Japan and others.Center has become a member of various international organizations. \n\nThe Internatioanl Association of Exhibitions and Events(IAEE)\n\nThe Association's major goal is to provide support to the agencies involved in the organisation of events and exhibitions through resources and information,and the development of the exhibition industry.The Center enjoys the IAEE membership as of September 17,2013. \n\nThe International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA)\n\nThe ICCA is the world s leading association in the field of organizing and accommodating international events with 90 member states at the moment.The Center became the ICCA member as of October 10,2013. \n\nThe International Association of Convention Centers (AIPC)\n\nThe Association the Center acceded as of September 15,2014 unites professional managers of convention centers and exhibitions halls,with more than 50 member states currently represented. \n\nThe Association of Event Organizers (AEO)\n\nThe association unites organizations involved in management,operation and sales of events.Sharing best practices in security and sustainability matters,as well as technical and financial issues constitutes the major objective of the AEO,with the Heydar Aliyev Center being a member to as of December 15,2014.\n\n"}
{"id": "6598994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6598994", "title": "History of erotic depictions", "text": "History of erotic depictions\n\nThe history of erotic depictions includes paintings, sculpture, photographs, dramatic arts, music and writings that show scenes of a sexual nature throughout time. They have been created by nearly every civilization, ancient and modern. Early cultures often associated the sexual act with supernatural forces and thus their religion is intertwined with such depictions. In Asian countries such as India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Japan and China, representations of sex and erotic art have specific spiritual meanings within native religions. The ancient Greeks and Romans produced much art and decoration of an erotic nature, much of it integrated with their religious beliefs and cultural practices.\n\nIn more recent times, as communication technologies evolved, each new technique, such as printing, photography, motion pictures and computers, has been adapted to display and disseminate these depictions.\n\nIn early times, erotic depictions were often a subset of the indigenous or religious art of cultures and as such were not set aside or treated differently than any other type. The modern concept of pornography did not exist until the Victorian era. Its current definition was added in the 1860s, replacing the older one meaning writings about prostitutes. It first appeared in an English medical dictionary in 1857 defined as \"a description of prostitutes or of prostitution, as a matter of public hygiene.\" By 1864, the first version of the modern definition had appeared in Webster's Dictionary: \"licentious painting employed to decorate the walls of rooms sacred to bacchanalian orgies, examples of which exist in Pompeii.\" This was the beginning of what today refers to explicit pictures in general. Though some specific sex acts were regulated or prohibited by earlier laws, merely looking at objects or images depicting them was not outlawed in any country until 1857. In some cases, the possession of certain books, engravings or image collections was outlawed, but the trend to compose laws that actually restricted viewing sexually explicit things in general was a Victorian construct.\n\nWhen large-scale excavations of Pompeii were undertaken in the 1860s, much of the erotic art of the Romans came to light, shocking the Victorians who saw themselves as the intellectual heirs of the Roman Empire. They did not know what to do with the frank depictions of sexuality, and endeavored to hide them away from everyone but upper-class scholars. The movable objects were locked away in the Secret Museum in Naples, and what could not be removed was covered and cordoned off so as to not corrupt the sensibilities of women, children and the working class. England's (and the world's) first laws criminalising pornography were enacted with the passage of the Obscene Publications Act of 1857. Despite their occasional repression, depictions of erotic themes have been common for millennia.\n\nPornography has existed throughout recorded history and has adapted to each new medium, including photography, cinema, video, and computers and the internet.\n\nThe first instances of modern pornography date back to the sixteenth century when sexually explicit images differentiated itself from traditional sexual representations in European art by combining the traditionally explicit representation of sex and the moral norms of those times.\n\nThe first amendment prohibits the U.S. government from restricting speech based on its content. Indecent speech is protected and may be regulated, but not banned. Obscenity is the judicially recognized exception to the first amendment. Historically, this exception was used in an attempt to ban information about sex education, studies on nudism, and sexually explicit literature.\n\nIn the 1970s in the United States, attempts were made to shut down the pornography industry by prosecuting individuals on prostitution charges. In the case of \"People v. Freeman\", the California Supreme Court ruled to distinguish prostitution as an individual taking part in sexual activities in exchange for money versus an individual who is portraying a sexual act on-screen as part of their acting performance. The case was not appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, thus it is only binding in the state of California.\nAmong the oldest surviving examples of erotic depictions are Paleolithic cave paintings and carvings. Some of the more common images are of animals, hunting scenes and depictions of human genitalia. Nude human beings with exaggerated sexual characteristics are depicted in some Paleolithic paintings and artifacts (e.g. Venus figurines). Recently discovered cave art at Creswell Crags in England, thought to be more than 12,000 years old, includes some symbols that may be stylized versions of female genitalia. As there is no direct evidence of the use of these objects, it is speculated that they may have been used in religious rituals, or for a more directly sexual purpose.\n\nArchaeologists in Germany reported in April 2005 that they had found what they believe is a 7,200-year-old scene depicting a male figurine bending over a female figurine in a manner suggestive of sexual intercourse. The male figure has been named Adonis von Zschernitz.\n\nA vast number of artifacts have been discovered from ancient Mesopotamia depicting explicit heterosexual sex. Glyptic art from the Sumerian Early Dynastic Period frequently shows scenes of frontal sex in the missionary position. In Mesopotamian votive plagues from the early second millennium BC, the man is usually shown entering the woman from behind while she bends over, drinking beer through a straw. Middle Assyrian lead votive figurines often represent the man standing and penetrating the woman as she rests on top of an altar. Scholars have traditionally interpreted all these depictions as scenes of ritual sex, but they are more likely to be associated with the cult of Inanna, the goddess of sex and prostitution. Many sexually explicit images were found in the temple of Inanna at Assur, which also contained models of male and female sexual organs, including stone phalli, which may have been worn around the neck as an amulet or used to decorate cult statues, and clay models of the female vulva.\nDepictions of sexual intercourse were not part of the general repertory of ancient Egyptian formal art, but rudimentary sketches of heterosexual intercourse have been found on pottery fragments and in graffiti. The Turin Erotic Papyrus (Papyrus 55001) is a by Egyptian papyrus scroll discovered at Deir el-Medina, the last two-thirds of which consist of a series of twelve vignettes showing men and women in various sexual positions. The men in the illustrations are \"scruffy, balding, short, and paunchy\" with exaggeratedly large genitalia and do not conform to Egyptian standards of physical attractiveness, but the women are nubile and they are shown with objects from traditional erotic iconography, such as convolvulus leaves and, in some scenes, they are even holding items traditionally associated with Hathor, the goddess of love, such as lotus flowers, monkeys, and sistra. The scroll was probably painted in the Ramesside period (1292-1075 BC) and its high artistic quality indicates that was produced for a wealthy audience. No other similar scrolls have yet been discovered.\nThe ancient Greeks often painted sexual scenes on their ceramics, many of them famous for being some of the earliest depictions of same-sex relations and pederasty. Greek art often portrays sexual activity, but it is impossible to distinguish between what to them was illegal or immoral since the ancient Greeks did not have a concept of pornography. Their art simply reflects scenes from daily life, some more sexual than others. Carved phalli can be seen in places of worship such as the temple of Dionysus on Delos, while a common household item and protective charm was the herm, a statue consisting of a head on a square plinth with a prominent phallus on the front. The Greek male ideal had a small penis, an aesthetic the Romans later adopted. The Greeks also created the first well-known instance of lesbian eroticism in the West, with Sappho's \"Hymn to Aphrodite\" and other homoerotic works.\n\nThere are numerous sexually explicit paintings and sculptures from the ruined Roman buildings in Pompeii and Herculaneum but the original purposes of the depictions can vary. On one hand, in the Villa of the Mysteries, there is a ritual flagellation scene that is clearly associated with a religious cult and this image can be seen as having religious significance rather than sexual. On the other hand, graphic paintings in a brothel advertise sexual services in murals above each door. In Pompeii, phalli and testicles engraved in the sidewalks were created to aid visitors in finding their way by pointing to the prostitution and entertainment district as well as general decoration. The Romans considered depictions of sex to be decoration in good taste, and indeed the pictures reflect the sexual mores and practices of their culture, as on the Warren Cup. Sex acts that were considered taboo (such as those that defiled the purity of the mouth) were depicted in baths for comic effect. Large phalli were often used near entryways, for the phallus was a good-luck charm, and the carvings were common in homes. One of the first objects excavated when the complex was discovered was a marble statue showing the god Pan having sex with a goat, a detailed depiction of bestiality considered so obscene that it was not on public display until the year 2000 and remains in the Secret Museum, Naples.\n\nThe Moche of Peru are another ancient people that sculpted explicit scenes of sex into their pottery. At least 500 Moche ceramics have sexual themes. The most frequently depicted act is anal sex, with scenes of vaginal penetration being very rare. Most pairs are heterosexual, with carefully carved genitalia to show that the anus, rather than the vagina, is being penetrated. Often, an infant is depicted breastfeeding while the couple has sex. Fellatio is sometimes represented, but cunnilingus is absent. Some depict male skeletons masturbating, or being masturbated by living women.\n\nRafael Larco Hoyle speculates that their purpose was much different than that of other early cultures. He states that the Moche believed that the world of the dead was the exact opposite of the world of the living. Therefore, for funeral offerings, they made vessels showing sex acts such as masturbation, fellatio and anal sex that would not result in offspring. The hope was that in the world of the dead, they would take on their opposite meaning and result in fertility. The erotic pottery of the Moche is depicted in Hoyle's book \"Checan\".\n\nThere has been a long tradition of erotic painting in the East. India, Japan, China, Persia and other lands produced copious quantities of art celebrating the human faculty of love. The works depict love between men and women as well as same-sex love. One of the most famous ancient sex manuals was the \"Kama Sutra\", written by Vātsyāyana in India during the first few centuries CE. Another notable treatise on human sexuality is The Perfumed Garden by the Tunisian Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Nafzawi, dating to the fifteenth century.\n\nIn Japan, the erotic art found its greatest flowering in the medium of the woodblock prints. The style is known as and some of its classic practitioners (e.g. Harunobu, Utamaro) produced a large number of works. Painted hand scrolls were also very popular. Shunga appeared in the 13th century and continued to grow in popularity despite occasional attempts to suppress them, the first of which was a ban on erotic books known as issued by the Tokugawa shogunate in Kyōhō 7 (1722). Shunga only ceased to be produced in the 19th century when photography was invented.\n\nThe Chinese tradition of the erotic was also extensive, with examples of the art dating back as far as the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368). The erotic art of China reached its peak during the latter part of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).\n\nIn both China and Japan, eroticism played a prominent role in the development of the novel. \"The Tale of Genji\", the work by an 11th-century Japanese noblewoman that is often called \"the world's first novel,\" traces the many affairs of its hero in discreet but carnal language. From 16th-century China, the still more explicit novel \"The Plum in the Golden Vase\" has been called one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature. \"The Tale of Genji\" has been celebrated in Japan since it was written, but \"The Plum in the Golden Vase\" was suppressed as pornography for much of its history, and replaced on the list of four classics.\nErotic scenes in medieval illuminated manuscripts also appeared, but were seen only by those who could afford the extremely expensive hand-made books. Most of these drawings occur in the margins of books of hours. Many medieval scholars think that the pictures satisfied the medieval cravings for both erotic pictures and religion in one book, especially since it was often the only book someone owned. Other scholars think the drawings in the margins were a kind of moral caution, but the depiction of priests and other ranking officials engaged in sex acts suggests political origins as well.\n\nIt was not until the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg that sexually explicit images entered into any type of mass circulation in the western world. Before that time, erotic images, being hand made and expensive, were limited to upper class males. Even the British Museum had a Secretum filled with a collection of ancient erotica donated by the upper class doctor, George Witt in 1865. The remains of the collection, including his scrapbooks, still reside in Cupboard 55, though the majority of it has recently been integrated with the museum's other collections.\n\nPrints became very popular in Europe from the middle of the fifteenth century, and because of their compact nature, were very suitable for erotic depictions that did not need to be permanently on display. Nudity and the revival of classical subjects were associated from very early on in history of the print, and many prints of subjects from mythological subjects were clearly in part an excuse for erotic material; the engravings of Giovanni Battista Palumba in particular. An earthier eroticism is seen in a printing plate of 1475-1500 for an \"Allegory of Copulation\" where a young couple are having sex, with the woman's legs high in the air, at one end of a bench, while at the other end a huge penis, with legs and wings and a bell tied around the bottom of the glans, is climbing onto the bench. Although the plate has been used until worn out, then re-engraved and heavily used again, none of the contemporary impressions printed, which probably ran into the hundreds, have survived.\n\nThe loves of classical gods, especially those of Jupiter detailed in Ovid provided many subjects where actual sex was the key moment in the story, and its depiction was felt to be justified. In particular Leda and the Swan, where the god appeared as a swan and seduced the woman, was depicted very explicitly; it seems that this—rather strangely—was considered more acceptable because he appeared as a bird. For a period ending in the early 16th century the boundaries of what could be depicted in for display in the semi-privacy of a Renaissance palace seemed uncertain. Michelangelo's \"Leda\" was a fairly large painting showing sex in progress, and one of the hundreds of illustrations to the book the \"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\" of 1499 shows Leda and the Swan having sex on top of a triumphal car watched by a crowd. \n\nIn the 16th century an attempt to print erotic material caused a scandal when the well-known Italian artist Marcantonio Raimondi published \"I Modi\" in 1524, an illustrated book of 16 \"postures\" or sexual positions. Raimondi was subsequently imprisoned by the Pope Clement VII and all copies of the illustrations were destroyed. Raimondi based the engravings on a series of erotic paintings that Giulio Romano was doing as a commission for the Palazzo del Te in Mantua. Though the two depictions were very similar, only Raimondi was prosecuted because his engravings were capable of being seen by the public. Romano did not know of the engravings until Pietro Aretino came to see the original paintings while Romano was still working on them. Aretino then composed sixteen explicit sonnets (\"both in your cunt and your behind, my prick will make me happy, and you happy and blissful\") to go with the paintings and secured Raimondi's release from prison. \"I Modi\" was then published a second time in 1527, with the poems and the pictures, making this the first time erotic text and images were combined, though the papacy once more seized all the copies it could find. Raimondi escaped prison that time, but the censorship was so strict that no complete editions of the original printings have ever been found. The text in existence is only a copy of a copy that was discovered 400 years later.\n\nIn the 17th century, numerous examples of pornographic or erotic literature began to circulate. These included \"L'Ecole des Filles\", a French work printed in 1655 that is considered to be the beginning of pornography in France. It consists of an illustrated dialogue between two women, a 16-year-old and her more worldly cousin, and their explicit discussions about sex. The author remains anonymous to this day, though a few suspected authors served light prison sentences for supposed authorship of the work. In his famous diary, Samuel Pepys records purchasing a copy for solitary reading and then burning it so that it would not be discovered by his wife; \"the idle roguish book, \"L'escholle de filles\"; which I have bought in plain binding… because I resolve, as soon as I have read it, to burn it.\"\nDuring the Enlightenment, many of the French free-thinkers began to exploit pornography as a medium of social criticism and satire. Libertine pornography was a subversive social commentary and often targeted the Catholic Church and general attitudes of sexual repression. The market for the mass-produced, inexpensive pamphlets soon became the bourgeoisie, making the upper class worry, as in England, that the morals of the lower class and weak-minded would be corrupted since women, slaves and the uneducated were seen as especially vulnerable during that time. The stories and illustrations (sold in the galleries of the Palais Royal, along with the services of prostitutes) were often anti-clerical and full of misbehaving priests, monks and nuns, a tradition that in French pornography continued into the 20th century. In the period leading up to the French Revolution, pornography was also used as political commentary; Marie Antoinette was often targeted with fantasies involving orgies, lesbian activities and the paternity of her children, and rumours circulated about the supposed sexual inadequacies of Louis XVI. During and after the Revolution, the famous works of the Marquis de Sade were printed. They were often accompanied by illustrations and served as political commentary for their author.\n\nThe English answer to this was \"Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\" (later abridged and renamed \"Fanny Hill\") written in 1748 by John Cleland. While the text satirised the literary conventions and fashionable manners of 18th century England, it was more scandalous for depicting a woman, the narrator, enjoying and even reveling in sexual acts with no dire moral or physical consequences. The text is hardly explicit as Cleland wrote the entire book using euphemisms for sex acts and body parts, employing 50 different ones just for the term penis. Two small earthquakes were credited to the book by the Bishop of London and Cleland was arrested and briefly imprisoned, but \"Fanny Hill\" continued to be published and is one of the most reprinted books in the English language. However, it was not legal to own this book in the United States until 1963 and in the United Kingdom until 1970.\n\nIn 1839, Louis Daguerre presented the first practical process of photography to the French Academy of Sciences. Unlike earlier photographic methods, his daguerreotypes had stunning quality and detail and did not fade with time. Artists adopted the new technology as a new way to depict the nude form, which in practice was the feminine form. In so doing, at least initially, they tried to follow the styles and traditions of the art form. Traditionally, an académie was a nude study done by a painter to master the female (or male) form. Each had to be registered with the French government and approved or they could not be sold. Soon, nude photographs were being registered as académie and marketed as aids to painters. However, the realism of a photograph as opposed to the idealism of a painting made many of these intrinsically erotic.\n\nThe daguerreotypes were not without drawbacks, however. The main difficulty was that they could only be reproduced by photographing the original picture since each image was an original and the all-metal process does not use negatives. In addition, the earliest daguerreotypes had exposure times ranging from three to fifteen minutes, making them somewhat impractical for portraiture. Unlike earlier drawings, action could not be shown. The poses that the models struck had to be held very still for a long time. Because of this, the standard pornographic image shifted from one of two or more people engaged in sex acts to a solitary woman exposing her genitals. Since one picture could cost a week's salary, the audience for these nudes mostly consisted of artists and the upper echelon of society. It was cheaper to hire a prostitute and experience the sex acts than it was to own a picture of them in the 1840s. Stereoscopy was invented in 1838 and became extremely popular for daguerreotypes, including the erotic images. This technology produced a type of three dimensional view that suited erotic images quite well. Although thousands of erotic daguerreotypes were created, only around 800 are known to survive; however, their uniqueness and expense meant that they were once the toys of rich men. Due to their rarity, the works can sell for more than 10,000 GBP.\n\nIn 1841, William Fox Talbot patented the calotype process, the first negative-positive process, making possible multiple copies. This invention permitted an almost limitless number of prints to be produced from a glass negative. Also, the reduction in exposure time made a true mass market for pornographic pictures possible. The technology was immediately employed to reproduce nude portraits. Paris soon became the centre of this trade. In 1848 only thirteen photography studios existed in Paris; by 1860, there were over 400. Most of them profited by selling illicit pornography to the masses who could now afford it. The pictures were also sold near train stations, by traveling salesmen and women in the streets who hid them under their dresses. They were often produced in sets (of four, eight or twelve), and exported internationally, mainly to England and the United States. Both the models and the photographers were commonly from the working class, and the artistic model excuse was increasingly hard to use. By 1855, no more photographic nudes were being registered as académie, and the business had gone underground to escape prosecution.\n\nThe Victorian pornographic tradition in Britain had three main elements: French photographs, erotic prints (sold in shops in Holywell Street, a long vanished London thoroughfare, swept away by the Aldwych), and printed literature. The ability to reproduce photographs in bulk assisted the rise of a new business individual, the porn dealer. Many of these dealers took advantage of the postal system to send out photographic cards in plain wrappings to their subscribers. Therefore, the development of a reliable international postal system facilitated the beginnings of the pornography trade. Victorian pornography had several defining characteristics. It reflected a very mechanistic view of the human anatomy and its functions. Science, the new obsession, was used to ostensibly study the human body. Consequently, the sexuality of the subject is often depersonalised, and is without any passion or tenderness. At this time, it also became popular to depict nude photographs of women of exotic ethnicities, under the umbrella of science. Studies of this type can be found in the work of Eadweard Muybridge. Although he photographed both men and women, the women were often given props like market baskets and fishing poles, making the images of women thinly disguised erotica. Parallel to the British printing history, photographers and printers in France frequently turned to the medium of postcards, producing great numbers of them. Such cards came to be known in the US as \"French postcards\".\nDuring the Victorian period, illegal pornographic periodicals such as \"The Pearl\", which ran for eighteen issues between 1879 and 1880, circulated clandestinely among circles of elite urban gentlemen. In 1880, halftone printing was used to reproduce photographs inexpensively for the first time. The invention of halftone printing took pornography and erotica in new directions at the beginning of the 20th century. The new printing processes allowed photographic images to be reproduced easily in black and white, whereas printers were previously limited to engravings, woodcuts and line cuts for illustrations. This was the first format that allowed pornography to become a mass market phenomena, it now being more affordable and more easily acquired than any previous form.\n\nFirst appearing in France, the new magazines featured nude (often, burlesque actresses were hired as models) and semi-nude photographs on the cover and throughout; while these would now be termed softcore, they were quite shocking for the time. The publications soon either masqueraded as \"art magazines\" or publications celebrating the new cult of naturism, with titles such as \"Photo Bits\", \"Body in Art\", \"Figure Photography\", \"Nude Living\" and \"Modern Art for Men.\" \"Health and Efficiency\", started in 1900, was a typical naturist magazine in Britain.\n\nAnother early form of pornography were comic books known as Tijuana bibles that began appearing in the U.S. in the 1920s and lasted until the publishing of glossy colour men's magazines commenced. These were crude hand drawn scenes often using popular characters from cartoons and culture.\n\nIn the 1940s, the word \"pinup\" was coined to describe pictures torn from men's magazines and calendars and \"pinned up\" on the wall by U.S. soldiers in World War II. While the '40s images focused mostly on legs, by the '50s, the emphasis shifted to breasts. Betty Grable and Marilyn Monroe were two of the most popular pinup models. In the second half of the 20th century, pornography evolved into the men's magazines such as \"Playboy\" and \"Modern Man\" of the 1950s. In fact, the beginning of the modern men's glossy magazine (or girlie magazine) can be traced to the 1953 purchase by Hugh Hefner of a photograph of Marilyn Monroe to use as the centerfold of his new magazine \"Playboy\". Soon, this type of magazine was the primary medium in which pornography was consumed.\n\nIn postwar Britain digest magazines such as \"Beautiful Britons\", \"Spick\" and \"Span\", with their interest in nylons and underwear\nand the racier \"Kamera\" published by Harrison Marks were incredibly popular. The creative force behind \"Kamera\" was Harrison Marks' partner Pamela Green. These magazines featured nude or semi-nude women in extremely coy or flirtatious poses with no hint of pubic hair.\n\n\"Penthouse\", started by Bob Guccione in England in 1965, took a different approach. Women looked indirectly at the camera, as if they were going about their private idylls. This change of emphasis was influential in erotic depictions of women. \"Penthouse\" was also the first magazine to publish pictures that included pubic hair and full frontal nudity, both of which were considered beyond the bounds of the erotic and in the realm of pornography at the time. In the late 1960s, magazines began to move into more explicit displays often focusing on the buttocks as standards of what could be legally depicted and what readers wanted to see changed. By the 1970s, they were focusing on the pubic area and eventually, by the 1990s, featured sexual penetration, lesbianism and homosexuality, group sex, masturbation, and fetishes in the more hard-core magazines such as \"Hustler\".\n\nMagazines for every taste and fetish were soon created due to the low cost of producing them. Magazines for the gay community flourished, the most notable and one of the first being \"Physique Pictorial\", started in 1951 by Bob Mizer when his attempt to sell the services of male models; however, Athletic Model Guild photographs of them failed. It was published in black and white, in a very clear yet photographic manner celebrating the male form and was published for nearly 50 years. The magazine was innovative in its use of props and costumes to depict the now standard gay icons like cowboys, gladiators and sailors.\nProduction of erotic films commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture. Two of the earliest pioneers were Frenchmen Eugène Pirou and Albert Kirchner. Kirchner (under the name \"Léar\") directed the earliest surviving erotic film for Pirou. The 7-minute 1896 film \"Le Coucher de la Mariee\" had Louise Willy performing a bathroom striptease. Other French filmmakers also considered that profits could be made from this type of risqué films, showing women disrobing.\n\nAlso in 1896 \"Fatima's Coochie-Coochie Dance\" was released as a short kinetoscope film featuring a gyrating belly dancer named Fatima. Her gyrating and moving pelvis was censored, one of the earliest films to be censored. At the time, there were numerous risqué films that featured exotic dancers. In the same year, \"The May Irwin Kiss\" contained the very first kiss on film. It was a 20-second film loop, with a close-up of a nuzzling couple followed by a short peck on the lips (\"the mysteries of the kiss revealed\"). The kissing scene was denounced as shocking and pornographic to early moviegoers and caused the Roman Catholic Church to call for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution. A tableau vivant style is used in short film \"The Birth of the Pearl\" (1901) featuring an unnamed long-haired young model wearing a flesh-colored body stocking in a direct frontal pose that provides a provocative view of the female body. The pose is in the style of Botticelli's The Birth of Venus.\n\nBecause Pirou is nearly unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films for being the first. In \"Black and White and Blue\" (2008), one of the most scholarly attempts to document the origins of the clandestine 'stag film' trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of Buenos Aires and other South American cities by around the start of the 20th century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years; however, none of these earliest pornographic films is known to survive. According to Patrick Robertson's \"Film Facts\", \"the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is \"A L'Ecu d'Or ou la bonne auberge\"\" made in France in 1908; the plot depicts a weary soldier who has a tryst with a servant girl at an inn. The Argentinian \"El Satario\" might be even older; it has been dated to somewhere between 1907 and 1912. He also notes that \"the oldest surviving pornographic films are contained in America's Kinsey Collection. One film demonstrates how early pornographic conventions were established. The German film \"Am Abend\" (1910) is \"a ten-minute film which begins with a woman masturbating alone in her bedroom, and progresses to scenes of her with a man performing straight sex, fellatio and anal penetration.\"\n\nIn Austria, Johann Schwarzer formed his Saturn-Film production company which was able to produce 52 erotic productions between 1906 and 1911, when the company was dissolved by the censorship authorities and the films destroyed.\n\nSoon illegal stag films or blue films, as they were called, were produced underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their bathtubs to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesman but being caught viewing or possessing them put one at the risk of prison.\n\nThe post-war era saw developments that further stimulated the growth of a mass market. Technological developments, particularly the introduction of the 8mm and super-8 film gauges, resulted in the widespread use of amateur cinematography. Entrepreneurs emerged to supply this market. In Britain, the productions of Harrison Marks were \"soft core\", but considered risqué in the 1950s. On the continent, such films were more explicit. Lasse Braun was as a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father's diplomatic privileges. Pornography was first legalized in Denmark July 1969, soon followed by the Netherlands the same year and Sweden in 1971, and this led to an explosion of commercially produced pornography in those countries, with the Color Climax Corporation quickly becoming the leading pornographic producer for the next couple of decades. Now that being a pornographer was a legitimate occupation, there was no shortage of businessmen to invest in proper plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, were smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold \"under the counter\" or (sometimes) shown in \"members only\" cinema clubs.\n\nThe first explicitly pornographic film with a plot that received a general theatrical release in the U.S. is generally considered to be \"Mona the Virgin Nymph\" (also known as \"Mona\"), a 59-minute 1970 feature by Bill Osco and Howard Ziehm, who went on to create the relatively high-budget hardcore/softcore (depending on the release) cult film \"Flesh Gordon\". The 1971 film \"Boys in the Sand\" represented a number of pornographic firsts. As the first generally available gay pornographic film, the film was the first to include on-screen credits for its cast and crew (albeit largely under pseudonyms), to parody the title of a mainstream film (in this case, \"The Boys in the Band\"), and to be reviewed by \"The New York Times\". In 1972, pornographic films hit their public peak in the United States with both \"Deep Throat\" and \"Behind the Green Door\" being met with public approval and becoming social phenomena.\n\n\"The Devil in Miss Jones\" followed in 1973 and many predicted that frank depictions of sex onscreen would soon become commonplace, with William Rotsler saying in 1973, \"Erotic films are here to stay. Eventually they will simply merge into the mainstream of motion pictures and disappear as a labeled sub-division. Nothing can stop this\". In practice, a combination of factors put an end to big budget productions and the mainstreaming of pornography, and in many places it never got close - with \"Deep Throat\" not approved in its uncut form in Britain until 2000, and not shown publicly until June 2005,\n\nBy 1982, most pornographic films were being shot on the cheaper and more convenient medium of videotape. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because of the different image quality that video tape produced; however, those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry's profits since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realised that continuing to shoot on film was no longer a profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's private homes. This was the end of the age of big budget productions and the mainstreaming of pornography. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover every fetish possible since filming was now so inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands now were, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos.\n\nErotic CD-ROMs were popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s because they brought an unprecedented element of interactiveness and fantasy. However, their poor quality was a drawback and when the Internet became common in households their sales declined. About the same time as the video revolution, the Internet became the preferred source of pornography for many people, offering both privacy in viewing and the chance to interact with people. The recent influx of widely available technology such as digital cameras, both moving and still, has blurred the lines between erotic films, photographs and amateur and professional productions.\nIt allows easy access to both formats, making the production of them easily achieved by anyone with access to the equipment. Much of the pornography available today is produced by amateurs. Digital media is revolutionary in that it allows photographers and filmmakers to manipulate images in ways previously not possible, heightening the drama or eroticism of a depiction.\n\nHigh-definition video shows signs of changing the image of pornography as the technology is increasingly used for professional productions. The porn industry was one of the first to adopt the technology and it may have been a deciding factor in the format competition between HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc. Additionally, the clearer sharper images it provides have prompted performers to get cosmetic surgery and professional grooming to hide imperfections that are not visible on other video formats. Other adaptations have been different camera angles and techniques for close-ups and lighting.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56280", "title": "Jana Gana Mana", "text": "Jana Gana Mana\n\n\"Jana Gana Mana\" () is the national anthem of India. It was originally composed as Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata in Bengali by poet Rabindranath Tagore. The first stanza of the song Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India as the National Anthem on 24 January 1950. A formal rendition of the national anthem takes approximately fifty-two seconds. A shortened version consisting of the first and last lines (and taking about 20 seconds to play) is also staged occasionally. It was first publicly sung on 27 December 1911 at the Calcutta (now, Kolkata) Session of the Indian National Congress.\n\nA separate poem, Vande Mataram, was created \"national song\" of India during both the colonial period and after independence in 1956.\n\nThe poem was first sung on the second day of the annual session of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta (now Kolkata) on 27 December 1911, and again in January 1912 at the annual event of the Adi Brahmo Samaj. Though the Bengali song had been written in 1911, it was largely unknown except to the readers of the Adi Brahmo Samaj journal, \"Tattwabodhini Patrika\", of which Tagore was the editor.\n\nSong was performed by Sarala Devi Chowdhurani, Tagore’s niece, along with a group of school students, in front of prominent Congress Members like Bishan Narayan Dhar, Indian National Congress President and Ambika Charan Majumdar. \n\nIn 1912, the song was published under the title \"Bharat Bhagya Bidhata\" in the Tatwabodhini Patrika, which was the official publication of the Brahmo Samaj and of which Tagore was the Editor. \n\nOutside of Calcutta, the song was first sung by the bard himself at a session in Besant Theosophical College in Madanapalle, Andhra Pradesh on 28 February 1919 when Tagore visited the college and sung the song. The song enthralled the college students while Margaret Cousins, then vice-principal of the college (also an expert in European music and wife of Irish poet James Cousins), both requested Tagore to create an English translation of the song and set down the musical notation to the national anthem, which is followed only when the song is sung in the original slow rendition style. Tagore translated the work into English while at the college on 28 February 1919, titled . The college adopted Tagore's translation of the song as their prayer song which is sung till today.\n\nBefore it was the national anthem of India, \"Jana Gana Mana\" was heard in the film \"Hamrahi\" (1945).\n\nOn the occasion of India attaining freedom, the Indian Constituent Assembly assembled for the first time as a sovereign body on 14 August 1947, midnight and the session closed with a unanimous performance of Jana Gana Mana. \n\nThe members of the Indian Delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations held at New York in 1947 gave a recording of Jana Gana Mana as the country’s national anthem. The song was played by the house orchestra in front of a gathering consisting of representatives from all over the world.\n\nThe National Anthem of India is played or sung on various occasions. Instructions have been issued from time to time about the correct versions of the Anthem, the occasions on which these are to be played or sung, and about the need for paying respect to the anthem by observance of proper decorum on such occasions. The substance of these instructions has been embodied in the information sheet issued by the government of India for general information and guidance. The approximate duration of the Full Version of National Anthem of India is 52 seconds and 20 seconds for shorter version.\n\nThe poem was composed in a literary register of the Bengali language called sadhu bhasa. The song has been written almost entirely using nouns that also can function as verbs and has commonality with all major languages in India due to Sanskrit being their common source of formal vocabulary. Therefore, the original song is quite clearly understandable, and in fact, remains almost unchanged in several widely different Indian languages (if variations in inherent vowel and pronunciation of approximants and some sibilants are ignored).\n\nA short version consisting of the first and last lines of the National Anthem is also played on certain occasions. It reads as follows\n\nTranslation by Tagore, dated 28 February 1919 at the Besant Theosophical College. Refer to for the translation of the full poem. Primary sources available in the \"Gallery\" section.\n\nIn Kerala, students belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses religious denomination were expelled by school authorities for their refusal to sing the national anthem on religious grounds, although they stood up respectfully when the anthem was sung. The Kerala High Court concluded that there was nothing in it which could offend anyone's religious susceptibilities, and upheld their expulsion. On 11 August 1986, the Supreme Court reversed the High Court and ruled that the High Court had misdirected itself because the question is not whether a particular religious belief or practice appeals to our reason or sentiment but whether the belief is genuinely and conscientiously held as part of the profession or practice of a religion. \"Our personal views and reactions are irrelevant\" The Supreme Court affirmed the principle that it is not for a secular judge to sit in judgment on the correctness of a religious belief.\n\nSupreme Court observed in its ruling\n\nOn 30 November 2016, Supreme Court of India ordered the National Anthem must be played before movies in theaters, in order to instill \"committed patriotism and nationalism\". On 10 February 2017, 2 Kashmiris were booked for not standing during anthem in Jammu Cinema, under provisions of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. This was the first arrest of its kind made by a state government in India. In January 2018, the government reversed its stance and requested that the Supreme Court rescind the order until a government panel could consider the issue in more depth; the court agreed, and so around 9 January 2018 the National Anthem ceased being compulsory in movie theaters.\n\nThe composition was first sung during a convention of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta on 27 December 1911. It was sung on the second day of the convention, and the agenda of that day devoted itself to a loyal welcome of George V on his visit to India. The event was reported thus in the British Indian press:\n\"The Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore sang a song composed by him specially to welcome the Emperor.\" (\"Statesman\", Dec. 28, 1911)\n<br>\"The proceedings began with the singing by Rabindranath Tagore of a song specially composed by him in honour of the Emperor.\" (\"Englishman\", Dec. 28, 1911)<br>\"When the proceedings of the Indian National Congress began on Wednesday 27th December 1911, a Bengali song in welcome of the Emperor was sung. A resolution welcoming the Emperor and Empress was also adopted unanimously.\" (\"Indian\", Dec. 29, 1911)\n\nMany historians aver that the newspaper reports cited above were misguided. The confusion arose in British Indian press since a different song, \"Badshah Humara\" written in Hindi by Rambhuj Chaudhary, was sung on the same occasion in praise of the monarch. The nationalist Indian press stated this difference of events clearly:\n\n\"The proceedings of the Congress party session started with a prayer in Bengali to praise God (song of benediction). This was followed by a resolution expressing loyalty to King George V. Then another song was sung welcoming King George V.\" (\"Amrita Bazar Patrika\", Dec.28,1911)<br>\n\nEven the report of the annual session of the Indian National Congress of December 1911 stated this difference:\n\n\"On the first day of 28th annual session of the Congress, proceedings started after singing Vande Mataram. On the second day the work began after singing a patriotic song by Babu Ravindranath Tagore. Messages from well wishers were then read and a resolution was passed expressing loyalty to King George V. Afterwards the song composed for welcoming King George V and Queen Mary was sung.\"\nOn 10 November 1937 Tagore wrote a letter to Mr Pulin Bihari Sen about the controversy. That letter in Bengali can be found in Tagore's biography\" Ravindrajivani, volume II page 339\" by \"Prabhatkumar Mukherjee\".\n\nAgain in his letter of 19 March 1939 Tagore writes:\n\n\"I should only insult myself if I cared to answer those who consider me capable of such unbounded stupidity as to sing in praise of George the Fourth or George the Fifth as the Eternal Charioteer leading the pilgrims on their journey through countless ages of the timeless history of mankind.\"\n\"(Purvasa, Phalgun, 1354, p. 738.)\"\nMoreover, Tagore was hailed as a patriot who wrote other songs too apart from \"Jana Gana Mana\" lionising the Indian independence movement. He renounced his knighthood in protest against the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. The Knighthood (i.e. the title of 'Sir') was conferred on him by the same King George V after receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature for \"Gitanjali\" from the government of Sweden. Two of Tagore's more politically charged compositions, \"Chitto Jetha Bhayshunyo\" (\"Where the Mind is Without Fear\", Gitanjali Poem #35) and \"Ekla Chalo Re\" (\"If They Answer Not to Thy Call, Walk Alone\"), gained mass appeal, with the latter favoured by Gandhi and Netaji.\n\nAnother controversy is that only those provinces that were under British rule, i.e. Punjab, Sindh, Gujarat, Maratha, Dravid (South India), Odisha/Utkal and Bengal, were mentioned. None of the princely states – Kashmir, Rajasthan, Hyderabad, Mysore or Kerala – or the states in Northeast India, which are now integral parts of India were mentioned. But opponents of this proposition claim that Tagore mentioned only the border states of India to include complete India. Whether the princely states would form a part of a liberated Indian republic was a matter of debate even till Indian Independence. 'Dravida' includes the people from the south (though Dravida specifically means Tamil and even then, the same consideration is not given for the south since there are many distinct people whereas in the north each of the distinct people are named) and 'Jolodhi' (Stanza 1) is Sanskrit for \"seas and oceans\". Even North-East which was under British rule or holy rivers apart from Ganges and Yamuna are not mentioned to keep the song in its rhythm. India has 29 states, 7 union territories.\n\nIn 2005, there were calls to delete the word \"Sindh\" and substitute it with the word Kashmir. The argument was that Sindh was no longer a part of India, having become part of Pakistan as a result of the Partition of 1947. Opponents of this proposal hold that the word \"Sindh\" refers to the Indus and to Sindhi culture, and that Sindhi people are an integral part of India's cultural fabric. The Supreme Court of India declined to change the national anthem and the wording remains unchanged.\n\nOn 17 December 2013, MLA of Assam, Phani Bhushan Choudhury cited article of 'The Times of India' published on 26 January 1950, stating that originally the word 'Kamarup' was included in the song, but was later changed to 'Sindhu' and claimed that Kamarup should be re-included. To this, the then minister Rockybul Hussain replied that the state government would initiate steps in this regard after response from the newspaper. The debate was further joined by the then minister Ardhendu Dey, mentioning 'Sanchayita' (edited by Tagore himself) etc. where he said Kamrup was not mentioned.\n\n\n"}

He was a very pious man and was said to have effected many miraculous cures for gout and toothache. \nDuring a drought, he discovered a well, whose waters were reputed to have miraculous properties. His reputation for holiness was such that he is believed to have cast the devil into a boot. He is often pictured holding a boot with a devil in it, which was thought to be the origin of the child's jack-in-the-box toy. However, the toy did not come about until over 500 years after Schorne's time. When he died, his shrine in the church at North Marston became a popular place of pilgrimage and he was regarded by many as a saint, although he was never canonised. His remains were later moved to St George's Chapel, Windsor, the burial place of English monarchs. Henry VIII, who was buried there, went on pilgrimage to Schorne's Well in July 1511 and May 1521.

{"id": "18932654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18932654", "title": "Koyaanisqatsi", "text": "Koyaanisqatsi\n\nKoyaanisqatsi (), also known as Koyaanisqatsi: Life Out of Balance, is a 1982 American experimental film directed by Godfrey Reggio with music composed by Philip Glass and cinematography by Ron Fricke.\n\nThe film consists primarily of slow motion and time-lapse footage of cities and many natural landscapes across the United States. The visual tone poem contains neither dialogue nor a vocalized narration: its tone is set by the juxtaposition of images and music. Reggio explained the lack of dialogue by stating \"it's not for lack of love of the language that these films have no words. It's because, from my point of view, our language is in a state of vast humiliation. It no longer describes the world in which we live.\" In the Hopi language, the word \"Koyaanisqatsi\" means \"unbalanced life\". The film is the first in the Qatsi trilogy of films: it is followed by \"Powaqqatsi\" (1988) and \"Naqoyqatsi\" (2002). The trilogy depicts different aspects of the relationship between humans, nature and technology. \"Koyaanisqatsi\" is the best known of the trilogy and is considered a cult film. However, because of copyright issues, the film was out of print for most of the 1990s.\n\nThe first image in the film is of the Great Gallery pictograph in Horseshoe Canyon, in Canyonlands National Park, Utah. The section shown depicts several tall, shadowed figures standing near a taller figure adorned with a crown. The next image is a close-up of a Saturn V rocket during its launch (Apollo 11). The film fades into a shot of a desolate desert landscape. From there, it progresses to footage of various natural phenomena such as waves and clouds.\n\nThe film's introduction to human involvement in the environment is a low aerial shot of choppy water, cutting to a similar shot of rows of cultivated flowers. After aerial views of monumental rock formations partly drowned by the artificial Lake Powell, we see a large mining truck causing billows of black dust. This is followed by shots of power lines in the desert. Man's continued involvement in the environment is depicted through images of mining operations, oil fields, the Navajo Generating Station, the Glen Canyon Dam, and atomic bomb detonations in a desert. Following the atomic bomb detonations, the next sequence begins with a shot of sunbathers on a beach, then pans to the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in the background. Shots of taxiing United Airlines Boeing 747 aircraft and traffic patterns during rush hour are seen on a freeway and a shot of a large parking lot. This is followed with stock footage of Soviet tanks lined up in rows and a military aircraft, and an aircraft carrier.\n\nTime-lapse photography of shadows of clouds are seen moving across the skyscrapers. Shots of various housing projects in disrepair, and includes footage of the decay and demolition of the Pruitt-Igoe housing project in St. Louis. The sequence ends with footage of the destruction of large buildings. A time-lapse shot of a crowd of people who appear to be waiting in a line. This is followed by shots of people walking along streets in slow motion.\n\nThe next sequence begins with shots of buildings and a shot of a sunset reflected in the glass of a skyscraper. The sequence uses time-lapse photography of the activity of modern life. The events captured in this sequence involve people interacting with modern technology. The first shots are traffic patterns as seen from skyscrapers at night. This is followed by a composite shot of the moon passing behind a skyscraper. The next shots are closer shots of cars on a highway. The sun rises over the city and we see people hurrying to work. The film shows at regular speed the operation of machines packaging food. People are shown sorting mail, sewing jeans, manufacturing televisions and doing other jobs with the use of modern technology. A shot of hot dogs being sent down rows of conveyors is followed by a shot of people moving up escalators. The frenetic speed and pace of the cuts and music do not slow as shots of modern leisure are shown. People eat, play, shop and work at the same speed. The sequence begins to come full circle as the manufacture of cars in an assembly line factory is shown.\n\nMore shots of highway traffic are shown, this time in daylight. The film shows the movement of cars, shopping carts, and televisions on an assembly line, and elevators moving from first-person perspective. The film then shows clips from various television shows being channel surfed in fast motion. The film, in slow motion, then shows several people reacting to being candidly filmed on the street. The camera stays on them until the moment when they acknowledge its presence by looking directly at it. The sequence then shows cars moving much faster than they were moving before.\n\nPictures of microchips and satellite photography of metropolitan cities are shown, comparing the lay of each of them. Various shots of people are seen from all walks of modern life, from beggars to debutantes. The final sequence shows footage of a rocket lifting off, only to end up exploding after a few seconds. Editing suggest that there is only one rocket, while in fact two different events were used: The first batch of footage shows a Saturn V lifting off (Apollo 11), followed by footage of the May 1962 explosion of the first Atlas-Centaur. The camera follows a flaming rocket engine and a white vapor trail or smoke against a blue sky as the debris plummets toward the ground. The film concludes with another shot of desert rock art similar to the image at the beginning. Epilogue shows the translation of the titular Hopi word and of the prophecies sung in the last part of the soundtrack.\n\nIn 1972, Godfrey Reggio, of the Institute for Regional Education (IRE), was working on a media campaign in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which was sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The campaign involved invasions of privacy and the use of technology to control behavior. Instead of making public service announcements, which Reggio felt \"had no visibility,\" advertising spots were purchased for television, radio, newspapers, and billboards. Over thirty billboards were used for the campaign, and one design featured a close-up of the human eye, which Reggio described as a \"horrifying image.\" To produce the television commercials the IRE hired cinematographer Ron Fricke, who worked on the project for two years. The television advertisements aired during prime time programming and became so popular that viewers would call the television stations to learn when the next advertisement would be aired. Godfrey described the two-year campaign as \"extraordinarily successful,\" and as a result, Ritalin (methylphenidate) was eliminated as a behavior-modifying drug in many New Mexico school districts. But after the campaign ended, the ACLU eventually withdrew its sponsorship, and the IRE unsuccessfully attempted to raise millions of dollars at a fundraiser in Washington, D.C. The institute only had $40,000 left in their budget, and Reggio was unsure how to use the small amount of funds. Fricke insisted to Reggio that the money could be used to produce a film, which led to the production of \"Koyaanisqatsi.\"\n\nFricke and Reggio chose to shoot unscripted footage and edit it into an hour-long film. Production began in 1975 in St. Louis, Missouri. 16 mm film was used due to budget constraints, despite the preference to shoot with 35 mm film. Footage of the Pruitt–Igoe housing project was shot from a helicopter, and Fricke nearly passed out during filming, having never flown in a helicopter before. Reggio later chose to shoot in Los Angeles and New York City. As there was no formal script, Fricke shot whatever he felt would \"look good on film\". While filming in New York City, Fricke developed an idea to shoot portraits of people. A grey paper backdrop was displayed in Times Square, and Fricke stood back with the camera. People walking by started posing for the camera, thinking it was a still camera, and several shots from the setup ended up in the film. Reggio was not on location in Times Square when Fricke shot the footage and thought the idea of shooting portraits of people was \"foolish\". Upon viewing the footage, Reggio decided to devote an entire section of the film to portraits. The footage was processed with a special chemical to enhance the film's shadows and details, as all footage was shot only with existing lighting. The IRE's $40,000 was exhausted after the filming, and almost two cases of film had been used. The unedited footage was screened in Santa Fe, New Mexico, but Fricke said it was \"boring as hell\" and there were \"not that many good shots\". Fricke later moved to Los Angeles, and took a job as a waiter, unable to get a job in the film industry. While Fricke was working in Los Angeles, he edited the footage into a twenty-minute reel, but \"without regard for message or political content\".\n\nThe IRE was continuously receiving funding and wanted to continue the project in 1976, using 35 mm film. After quitting his waiting job, Fricke traveled with a camera crew to the Four Corners, which was chosen for filming for its \"alien look\". Due to the limited budget, Fricke shot with a 16 mm zoom lens onto 35 mm film. To compensate for the lens size, a 2× extender was added, which turned it into a full 35 mm zoom lens, allowing footage to be clearly captured onto 35 mm film. The two-week shoot included aerial footage taken from an airplane using a hand-held camera and ground footage taken using a tripod. The first aerial footage was too \"shaky\", so additional footage was taken from a camera mounted onto the airplane. Fricke traveled back to New York City in 1977, during which the New York City blackout occurred. Footage of the blackout was filmed in Harlem and the South Bronx, and the film was desaturated to match the appearance of the 16 mm footage.\n\nReggio and Fricke came across time-lapse footage in \"some low-visibility commercial work\". They felt such footage was \"the language [they] were missing\", and collectively decided to implement time-lapse as a major part of the film to create \"an experience of acceleration\". For the time-lapse footage, Fricke purchased a Mitchell camera, and built a motor with an intervalometer, which was used to precisely move the camera between frames. The system was powered by a gel cell battery that lasted for twelve hours, which enabled Fricke to shoot without the use of a generator. Most time-lapse shots were filmed at a frame rate of 1½ frames per second. Fricke wanted the footage to \"look normal\" and not contain any \"gimmicky\" special effects. The time-lapse shot overlooking the freeway in Los Angeles was filmed from the top of a building through a double exposure, with ten-second delay between frames. The first take was shot throughout the day for twelve hours, then the film was rewound and the same scene was shot at night for twenty minutes.\n\nThe scene with the Boeing 747 on the runway was filmed at Los Angeles International Airport, and was the longest continuous shot in the film. Fricke and his focus puller, Robert Hill, filmed at the airport every day for two weeks. To keep the shot of the 747 within the frame, the camera was slowly moved by increasing the voltage to the gear motors.\n\nIn addition to footage shot by Fricke, some of the footage of people and traffic in New York City was shot by cinematographer Hilary Harris. During post-production, Reggio was introduced to Harris' \"Organism\" (1975), which predominately features time-lapse footage of New York City streets. Reggio was impressed with Harris' work and subsequently hired him to work on \"Koyaanisqatsi\". Footage filmed by cinematographer Louis Schwartzberg was added into the cloud sequence, and additional stock footage was provided by MacGillivray Freeman Films.\n\nWhile Reggio was working on post-production at the Samuel Goldwyn Studio in 1981, he met film director Francis Ford Coppola through an associate from Zoetrope Studios, Coppola's production company. Prior to shooting \"The Outsiders\" (1983) and \"Rumble Fish\" (1983), Coppola requested to see \"Koyaanisqatsi\", and Reggio arranged a private screening shortly after its completion. Coppola told Reggio that he was waiting for a film such as \"Koyaanisqatsi\" and that it was \"important for people to see\", so he added his name into the credits and helped present and distribute the film. Coppola also decided to introduce and end the film with footage of pictographs from the Great Gallery at Horseshoe Canyon in Utah, after visiting the site and becoming fascinated by the ancient sandstone murals.\n\nThe film's soundtrack by Philip Glass was released in 1983, after the release of the film. Even though the amount of music in the film was almost as long as the film itself, the soundtrack release was only 46 minutes long and featured only selections from the film's pieces. In 1998, Glass rerecorded the album through Nonesuch Records with a length of 73 minutes, 21 seconds. The rerecording of the album featured two additional tracks from the film, as well as extended versions of previous tracks from the original album. The album was released as a Philip Glass album titled \"Koyaanisqatsi\", rather than a soundtrack to the film. The music has become so popular that the Philip Glass Ensemble has toured the world, playing the music for \"Koyaanisqatsi\" live in front of the movie screen.\n\nThe opening for \"The Grid\" begins with slow sustained notes on brass instruments. The music builds in speed and dynamics throughout the piece's 21 minutes. When the piece is at its fastest, it is characterized by a synthesizer playing the piece's bass line ostinato.\n\nGlass's music for the film is a highly recognizable example of the minimalist school of composition, which is characterized by heavily repeated figures, simple structures, and a tonal (although not in the traditional common practice sense of the word) harmonic language. Glass was one of the first composers to employ minimalism in film scoring, paving the way for many future composers of that style.\n\nThe complete original soundtrack recording was released on CD in 2009 on Glass's own label Orange Mountain Music.\n\nReggio stated that the \"Qatsi\" films are intended to simply create an experience and that \"it is up [to] the viewer to take for himself/herself what it is that [the film] means.\" He also said that \"these films have never been about the effect \"of\" technology, \"of\" industry \"on\" people. It's been that everyone: politics, education, things of the financial structure, the nation state structure, language, the culture, religion, all of that exists within the host of technology. So it's not the effect \"of\", it's that everything exists within [technology]. It's not that we \"use\" technology, we \"live\" technology. Technology has become as ubiquitous as the air we breathe ...\"\n\nAccording to \"\", the Hopi word \"koyaanisqatsi\" () is defined as \"life of moral corruption and turmoil\" or \"life out of balance\". The prefix \"koyaanis–\" means \"corrupted\" or \"chaotic\", and the word \"qatsi\" means \"life\" or \"existence\", literally translating \"koyaanisqatsi\" as \"chaotic life\". The film also defines the word as \"crazy life\", \"life in turmoil\", \"life disintegrating\", and \"a state of life that calls for another way of living\".\n\nIn the score by Philip Glass, the word \"Koyaanisqatsi\" is chanted at the beginning and end of the film in an \"otherworldly\" dark, sepulchral \"basso profondo\" by singer Albert de Ruiter over a solemn, four-bar organ-passacaglia bassline. Three Hopi prophecies sung by a choral ensemble during the latter part of the \"Prophecies\" movement are translated just prior to the end credits:\n\nDuring the end titles, the film gives Jacques Ellul, Ivan Illich, David Monongye, Guy Debord, and Leopold Kohr credit for inspiration. Moreover, amongst the consultants to the director are listed such names as Jeffrey Lew, T.A. Price, Belle Carpenter, Cybelle Carpenter, Langdon Winner, and Barbara Pecarich.\n\n\"Koyaanisqatsi\" premiered at the Santa Fe Film Festival on April 28, 1982. It was screened later that year at the Telluride Film Festival in August and at the New York Film Festival in September.\n\nTriumph Films offered to distribute the film, but Reggio turned down the offer as he wanted to work with a smaller company so he could be more involved with the release. He chose Island Alive as the distributor, a company newly formed in 1983 by Chris Blackwell of Island Records, and \"Koyaanisqatsi\" was the company's first release. Select theaters distributed a pamphlet that defined the title and the Hopi prophecies sung in the film, as well as a copy of the soundtrack from Island Records. The first theatrical run featured four-track Dolby Stereo sound, while later runs featured monaural sound.\n\nThe film's initial limited release began in San Francisco at the Castro Theatre on April 27, 1983. The producers spent $6,500 on marketing the initial release, which grossed $46,000 throughout its one-week run, and was the highest-grossing film in the San Francisco Bay Area that week. It was released in Los Angeles a month later where it grossed $300,000 at two theaters within 15 weeks. Additional releases in select cities throughout the United States continued in September 1983, beginning with a release in New York City on September 15. In mid-October, \"Koyaanisqatsi\" was released onto 40–50 screens throughout the country.\n\nA 1991 issue of \"Variety\" listed \"Koyaanisqatsi\" box office gross at $3.2 million.\n\n\"Koyaanisqatsi\" was originally released on VHS and laserdisc by Michael Nesmith's Pacific Arts Video.\n\nThe rights to \"Koyaanisqatsi\" were passed through various multinational entertainment companies, which eventually prevented a home video release. IRE enforced their legal and contractual rights by creating a federal court lawsuit. IRE distributed a privately issued release of the film on DVD. The release was available to those who made a donation of at least $180 to IRE, and was distributed in a sleeve that was signed by Reggio.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) eventually received the rights to the film, and \"Koyaanisqatsi\" was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on September 18, 2002, coinciding with the release of \"Naqoyqatsi\" (2002). Both films were available in a two-disc box set. Each DVD includes a documentary with interviews by Reggio and Glass and trailers for the \"Qatsi\" trilogy. Unlike the IRE release, which featured the film in the open matte format in which it was filmed, the MGM release was in cropped into a widescreen aspect as it was originally presented in theaters.\n\nOn January 13, 2012, a Blu-ray version (screen ratio 16:9) was released in Germany. The Blu-ray was also released in Australia by Umbrella Entertainment on March 22, 2012. In December 2012, Criterion released in the US a remastered Blu-ray and DVD of \"Koyaanisqatsi\", as part of a box set containing the \"Qatsi\" Trilogy.\n\n\"Koyaanisqatsi\" has a score of 89% on Rotten Tomatoes out of 18 reviews. In 1983, the film was entered into the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival. In 2000, \"Koyaanisqatsi\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\"Koyaanisqatsi\" is followed by the sequels \"Powaqqatsi\" and \"Naqoyqatsi\" and the shorts \"Anima Mundi\" and \"Evidence.\" \"Naqoyqatsi\" was completed after a lengthy delay caused by funding problems and premiered in the United States on October 18, 2002. The film's cinematographer, Ron Fricke, went on to direct \"Baraka\", a pure cinema movie which is often compared to \"Koyaanisqatsi\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

In Christian churches, this practice is used as both a symbolic and formal method of invoking the Holy Spirit primarily during baptisms and confirmations, healing services, blessings, and ordination of priests, ministers, elders, deacons, and other church officers, along with a variety of other church sacraments and holy ceremonies.\n\nThe practice of laying on of hands is also used in Navajo religious ceremonies.\n\nThe laying on of hands was an action referred to on numerous occasions in the Tanakh to accompany the conferring of a blessing or authority. \n\nAaron and the High Priests who succeeded him symbolically transferred the sins of the Children of Israel to a sacrificial goat by the laying on of hands: Leviticus. Moses ordained Joshua through \"semikhah\"—i.e. by the laying on of hands: , . The Bible adds that Joshua was thereby \"filled with the spirit of wisdom\". Moses also ordained the 70 elders (). The elders later ordained their successors in this way. Their successors in turn ordained others. This chain of hands-on \"semikhah\" continued through the time of the Second Temple, to an undetermined time. The exact date that the original \"semikhah\" succession ended is not certain. Many medieval authorities believed that this occurred during the reign of Hillel II, circa AD 360. However, it seems to have continued at least until AD 425 when Theodosius II executed Gamaliel VI and suppressed the Patriarchate and Sanhedrin.\n\nIn the New Testament the laying on of hands was associated with the receiving of the Holy Spirit (see Acts ). Initially the Apostles laid hands on new believers as well as believers (see ). In the early church, the practice continued and is still used in a wide variety of church ceremonies, such as during confirmation.\n\nThe New Testament also associates the laying on of hands with the conferral of authority or designation of a person to a position of responsibility. (See Acts , Acts ; and . Also possibly Acts , where \"ordained\"—Greek: χειροτονήσαντες—may be translated \"extended the hand\".) The use of the laying on of hands for the ordination of church officers has continued in many branches of Christianity.\n\nThe laying on of hands, known as the royal touch, was performed by kings in England and France, and was believed to cure scrofula (also called \"King's Evil\" at the time), a name given to a number of skin diseases. The rite of the king's touch began in France with Robert II the Pious, but legend later attributed the practice to Clovis as Merovingian founder of the Holy Roman kingdom, and Edward the Confessor in England. The belief continued to be common throughout the Middle Ages but began to die out with the Enlightenment. Queen Anne was the last British monarch to claim to possess this divine ability, though the Jacobite pretenders also claimed to do so. The French monarchy maintained the practice up until the 19th century. The act was usually performed at large ceremonies, often at Easter or other holy days.\n\n\n"}

Religious literature was common, but surviving secular writing much rarer. The New Testament was first published in 1767. The Book of Common Prayer and Bible were translated into Manx and published in 1610 and again in 1765. The first Manx Bible was printed between 1771 and 1775 and is the source and standard for modern Manx orthography. It was a collective translation undertaken by most the Manx clergy under the editorship of Philip Moore. Further editions followed in 1777 and a revised edition by the British and Foreign Bible Society 1819. A tradition of , religious songs or carols, developed, probably with its roots in the pre-Reformation period.

{"id": "40617847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40617847", "title": "Marion Cemetery Receiving Vault", "text": "Marion Cemetery Receiving Vault\n\nThe Marion Cemetery Receiving Vault is a funerary structure in the main cemetery of Marion, Ohio, United States. Constructed in the 1870s, this receiving vault originally fulfilled the normal purposes of such structures, but it gained prominence as the semipermanent resting place of Marion's most prominent citizen, U.S. President Warren G. Harding.\n\nThe vault is a limestone structure with a slate roof; it rests on a concrete foundation. Plans to build it were formulated as early as 1873, when the cemetery association voted to make plans for one; funds were insufficient, so the association decided not to build until sufficient money had become available. Six years later, the cemetery's trustees decided to build a vault, and to design it, they hired Toledo architect D.W. Giffs.\n\nAmong the association's reasons for building the vault was the desire to retard a modern form of grave robbery: the practice of body snatching was still relatively common, and the association wished to provide a place where bodies could be laid without risk of theft until they had decomposed so much that they would be useless to body snatchers. Accordingly, the final design for the vault included iron gates with secure locks. Other elements of the design included a double-arched ceiling, the creation of ventilation and related systems, and the placement of fine marble and carpet to beautify the structure and retard the harshness of death for decedents' family members at funerals. The entire structure is built into a hillside.\n\nWarren Gamaliel Harding died in early August 1923 while in office as President of the United States. The suddenness of his death produced chaos even on a personal level, as funeral services and a burial location must be worked out suddenly, and Mrs. Harding was forced to return to Washington, D.C. to wrap up her affairs and to move her possessions out of the White House in order to permit its new occupants, President and Mrs. Coolidge, to move in. Accordingly, no permanent burial place was employed immediately after his death, and funeral services were held at the Receiving Vault: Harding's family already owned burial plots in the cemetery, but a grander destination was planned for the deceased chief executive; in the meantime, soldiers from Fort Hayes in Columbus guarded the vault for six months. As plans were being made for the construction of a permanent presidential tomb elsewhere in the city, his body remained in the vault, being joined by Mrs. Harding's body after her death in 1924. The two continued to wait until the practical completion of the memorial in 1927; they were then moved to their permanent burial sites inside the memorial, although four more years passed before it was formally dedicated.\n\nTwo weeks before Christmas 1995, the Receiving Vault was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its architecture and because of the place it had played in the events of 1923. It is one of two National Register-listed sites in Marion's city cemetery — the chapel had been listed nine months before — and one of fourteen such locations throughout Marion County. Among these fourteen are Harding's permanent tomb and his home on Marion's east side.\n"}
{"id": "5347964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5347964", "title": "Medieval theatre", "text": "Medieval theatre\n\nMedieval theatre refers to theatrical performance in the period between the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century A.D. and the beginning of the Renaissance in approximately the 15th century A.D. Medieval Theatre covers all drama produced in Europe over that thousand-year period and refers to a variety of genres, including liturgical drama, mystery plays, morality plays, farces and masques. Beginning with Hrosvitha of Gandersheim in the 10th century, Medieval drama was for the most part very religious and moral in its themes, staging and traditions. The most famous examples of Medieval plays are the English cycle dramas, the York Mystery Plays, the Chester Mystery Plays, the Wakefield Mystery Plays and the N-Town Plays, as well as the morality play, \"Everyman\". One of the earliest surviving secular plays in English is \"The Interlude of the Student and the Girl\" (c. 1300).\n\nDue to a lack of surviving records and texts, a low literacy rate of the general population, and the opposition of the clergy to some types of performance, there are few surviving sources on Medieval drama of the Early and High Medieval periods. However, by the late period, drama and theatre began to become more secularized and a larger number of records survive documenting plays and performances.\n\nFaced with the problem of explaining a new religion to a largely illiterate population, churches in the Early Middle Ages began staging dramatized versions of particular biblical events on specific days of the year. These dramatizations were included in order to vivify annual celebrations. Symbolic objects and actions (vestments, altars, censers, and pantomime performed by priests) recalled the events which Christian ritual celebrates. These were extensive sets of visual signs that could be used to communicate with a largely illiterate audience. These performances developed into liturgical dramas, the earliest of which is the \"Whom do you Seek (Quem-Quaeritis)\" Easter trope, dating from ca. 925. Liturgical drama was sung responsively by two groups and did not involve actors impersonating characters. However, sometime between 965 and 975, Æthelwold of Winchester composed the \"Regularis Concordia (Monastic Agreement)\" which contains a playlet complete with directions for performance.\n\nAs the Western Roman Empire fell into severe decay through the 4th and 5th centuries A.D., the seat of Roman power shifted to Constantinople and the Eastern Roman Empire, later called the Byzantine Empire. While surviving evidence about Byzantine theatre is slight, existing records show that mime, pantomime, scenes or recitations from tragedies and comedies, dances, and other entertainments were very popular. Constantinople had two theatres that were in use as late as the 5th century A.D. However, the true importance of the Byzantines in theatrical history is their preservation of many classical Greek texts and the compilation of a massive encyclopedia called the Suda, from which is derived a large amount of contemporary information on Greek theatre. In the 6th century, the Emperor Justinian finally closed down all theatres for good.\n\nAccording to the binary thinking of the Church's early followers, everything that did not belong to God belonged to the Devil; thus all non-Christian gods and religions were satanic. Efforts were made in many countries through this period to not only convert Jews and pagans but to destroy pre-Christian institutions and influences. Works of Greek and Roman literature were burnt, the thousand-year-old Platonic Academy was closed, the Olympic Games were banned and all theatres were shut down. The theatre itself was viewed as a diabolical threat to Christianity because of its continued popularity in Rome even among new converts. Church fathers such as Tatian, Tertullian and Augustine characterized the stage as an instrument in the Devil's fiendish plot to corrupt men's souls, while acting was considered sinful because of its cruel mockery of God's creation.\n\nUnder these influences, the church set about trying to suppress theatrical spectacles by passing laws prohibiting and excluding Roman actors. They were forbidden to have contact with Christian women, own slaves, or wear gold. They were officially excommunicated, denied the sacraments, including marriage and burial, and were defamed and debased throughout Europe. For many centuries thereafter, clerics were cautioned to not allow these suddenly homeless, travelling actors to perform in their jurisdictions.\n\nFrom the 5th century, Western Europe was plunged into a period of general disorder that lasted (with a brief period of stability under the Carolingian Empire in the 9th century) until the 10th century A.D. As such, most organized theatrical activities disappeared in Western Europe. While it seems that small nomadic bands traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience, there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes .\n\nHrosvitha (c.935-973), an aristocratic canoness and historian in northern Germany, wrote six plays modeled on Terence's comedies but using religious subjects in the 10th century A.D. Terence's comedies had long been used in monastery schools as examples of spoken Latin but are full of clever, alluring courtesans and ordinary human pursuits such as sex, love and marriage. In order to preempt criticism from the church, Hrosvitha prefaced her collection by stating that her moral purpose to save Christians from the guilt they must feel when reading Classical literature. Her declared solution was to imitate the \"laudable\" deeds of women in Terence's plays and discard the \"shameless\" ones. These six plays are the first known plays composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western dramatic works of the post-Classical era. They were first published in 1501 and had considerable influence on religious and didactic plays of the sixteenth century. Hrosvitha was followed by Hildegard of Bingen (d. 1179), a Benedictine abbess, who wrote a Latin musical drama called \"Ordo Virtutum\" in 1155.\n\nThe anonymous pagan play \"Querolus\", written c.420, was adapted in the 12th century by Vitalis of Blois. Other secular Latin plays were also written in the 12th century, mainly in France but also in England (\"Babio\"). There certainly existed some other performances that were not fully fledged theatre; they may have been carryovers from the original pagan cultures (as is known from records written by the clergy disapproving of such festivals). It is also known that mimes, minstrels, bards, storytellers, and jugglers traveled in search of new audiences and financial support. Not much is known about these performers' repertoire and few written texts survive. One of the most famous of the secular plays is the musical \"Le Jeu de Robin et Marion\", written by Adam de la Halle in the 13th century, which is fully laid out in the original manuscript with lines, musical notation, and illuminations in the margins depicting the actors in motion. Adam also wrote another secular play, \"Jeu de la Fueillee\" in Arras, a French town in which theatre was thriving in the late 12th and 13th centuries. One play surviving from Arras, is \"Jeu de saint Nicolas\" by Jean Bodel (c.1200).\n\nAs the Viking invasions ceased in the middle of the 11th century A.D., liturgical drama had spread from Russia to Scandinavia to Italy. Only in Muslim-occupied Spain were liturgical dramas not presented at all. Despite the large number of liturgical dramas that have survived from the period, many churches would have only performed one or two per year and a larger number never performed any at all.\n\nThe Feast of Fools was especially important in the development of comedy. The festival inverted the status of the lesser clergy and allowed them to ridicule their superiors and the routine of church life. Sometimes plays were staged as part of the occasion and a certain amount of burlesque and comedy may have entered the liturgical drama as a result of its influence. \n\nPerformance of religious plays outside of the church began sometime in the 12th century through a traditionally accepted process of merging shorter liturgical dramas into longer plays which were then translated into vernacular and performed by laymen and thus accessible to a wider segment of society inclusive of the working class. The use of vernacular enabled drama to be understood and enjoyed by a larger audience. \"The Mystery of Adam\" (1150) gives credence to this theory as its detailed stage direction suggest that it was staged outdoors. A number of other plays from the period survive, including \"La Seinte Resurrection\" (Norman), \"The Play of the Magi Kings\" (Spanish), and \"Sponsus\" (French).\n\nEconomic and political changes in the High Middle Ages led to the formation of guilds and the growth of towns, and this would lead to significant changes for theatre starting in this time and continuing into in the Late Middle Ages. Trade guilds began to perform plays, usually religiously based, and often dealing with a biblical story that referenced their profession. For instance, a baker's guild would perform a reenactment of the Last Supper. In the British Isles, plays were produced in some 127 different towns during the Middle Ages. These vernacular \"mystery plays\" were written in cycles of a large number of plays: York (48 plays), Chester (24), Wakefield (32) and Unknown (42). A larger number of plays survive from France and Germany in this period and some type of religious dramas were performed in nearly every European country in the Late Middle Ages. Many of these plays contained comedy, devils, villains and clowns.\n\nThe majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. For example, at Valenciennes in 1547, more than 100 roles were assigned to 72 actors. Plays were staged on pageant wagon stages, which were platforms mounted on wheels used to move scenery. Often providing their own costumes, amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers. The platform stage, which was an unidentified space and not a specific locale, allowed for abrupt changes in location.\n\nMorality plays emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished until 1550. \"The Castle of Perseverance\" which depicts mankind's progress from birth to death. Though \"Everyman\" may possibly be the best known of this genre, it is atypical in many ways. Everyman receives Death's summons, struggles to escape and finally resigns himself to necessity. Along the way, he is deserted by Kindred, Goods, and Fellowship - only Good Deeds goes with him to the grave.\n\nSecular drama was also staged throughout the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is \"The Play of the Greenwood\" by Adam de la Halle in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and folk material such as faeries and other supernatural occurrences. Farces also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. The majority of these plays come from France and Germany and are similar in tone and form, emphasizing sex and bodily excretions. The best known playwright of farces is Hans Sachs (1494–1576) who wrote 198 dramatic works. In England, \"The Second Shepherds' Play\" of the \"Wakefield Cycle\" is the best known early farce. However, farce did not appear independently in England until the 16th century with the work of John Heywood (1497–1580).\n\nA significant forerunner of the development of Elizabethan drama was the Chambers of Rhetoric in the Low Countries. These societies were concerned with poetry, music and drama and held contests to see which society could compose the best drama in relation to a question posed.\n\nAt the end of the Late Middle Ages, professional actors began to appear in England and Europe. Richard III and Henry VII both maintained small companies of professional actors. Their plays were performed in the great hall of a nobleman's residence, often with a raised platform at one end for the audience and a \"screen\" at the other for the actors. Also important were Mummers' plays, performed during the Christmas season, and court masques. These masques were especially popular during the reign of Henry VIII who had a house of revels built and an office of revels established in 1545.\n\nDepending on the area of the performances, the plays were performed in the middle of the street, on pageant wagons in the streets of great cities (this was inconvenient for the actors because the small stage size made stage movement impossible), in the halls of nobility, or in the round in amphitheatres, as suggested by current archaeology in Cornwall and the southwest of England. The most detailed illustration of a mystery play stage design is the frontispiece to Hubert Cailleau's \"The Passion and Resurrection of the Savior\". All medieval stage production was temporary and expected to be removed upon the completion of the performances. Actors, predominantly male, typically wore long, dark robes. Medieval plays such as the Wakefield cycle, or the Digby Magdalene featured lively interplay between two distinct areas, the wider spaces in front of the raised staging areas, and the elevated areas themselves (called, respectively, the locus and the platea). Typically too, actors would move between these locations in order to suggest scene changes, rather than remain stationary and have the scene change around them as is typically done in modern theatres.\nScenery, stage machinery and costumes enabled a more realistic depiction of the message the play was trying to promote. Whether on a fixed stage, with more opportunity for spectacle, or on a pageant wagon that moved through the streets, the ornate details and tricks attributed to these productions enhanced the audience’s experience of the play.\n\nChanging political and economic factors greatly affected theatre at the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the Modern Era. First, the Protestant Reformation targeted the theatre, especially in England, in an effort to stamp out allegiance to Rome. In Wakefield, for example, the local mystery cycle text shows signs of Protestant editing, with references to the pope crossed out and two plays completely eliminated because they were too Catholic. However, it was not just the Protestants who attacked the theatre of the time. The Council of Trent banned religious plays in an attempt to rein in the extrabiblical material that the Protestants frequently lampooned.\n\nA revival of interest in ancient Roman and Greek culture changed the tastes of the learned classes in the performing arts. Greek and Roman plays were performed and new plays were written that were heavily influenced by the classical style. This led to the creation of Commedia dell'arte and influenced Renaissance theatre.\n\nA change of patronage also caused drastic changes to the theatre. In England the monarch and nobility started to support professional theatre troupes (including Shakespeare's Lord Chamberlain's Men and King's Men), which catered to their upper class patrons' tastes.\n\nFinally, the construction of permanent theaters, such as The Theatre signaled a major turning point. Permanent theaters allowed for more sophisticated staging and storytelling. \n\nMany components of theatre that developed during the Middle Ages continue to be incorporated in productions around the world to this day, such as use of the vernacular, spectacle, stage direction and the use of farce. Performances that were spoken in the vernacular provided opportunities for larger audiences, who included members of lower socio-economic status, who would have otherwise been excluded from understanding the performances.\n\nMedieval theatre differed from the classical theatre for it emphasized spectacle. In addition, it presented various actions on stage in time and space and presented a combination of the sublime with detailed realism. Approximately 1400 A.D., the dramas were performed with spectacle; no longer dependent exclusively on the spoken word, but incorporating music, dance, costume and set design. The spectacle of the later Medieval theatre made it necessary to have detailed stage directions. A sample of documented staging drawings and directions remain from the 15th-century morality play \"The Castle of Perseverance\". The evolution to the dependence on detailed stage direction made possible the great Shakespearean stage.\n\nMummers plays are still performed regularly throughout the United Kingdom. What relation they may bear to their medieval antecedents is unknown. The surviving texts of this oral tradition were recorded in the 18th century, at a time when the industrial revolution began to break up the rural communities in which the plays were performed.\n\nMystery Plays are still produced regularly throughout the United Kingdom. The local cycles were revived in both York and Chester in 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain, and are still performed by the local guilds. The N-Town cycle was revived in 1978 as the Lincoln mystery plays,\n\nIn 1977 the National Theatre commissioned Tony Harrison to create \"The Mysteries\", a re-working of the Wakefield Cycle and others. It was revived in 1985 (whereupon the production was filmed for Channel 4 Television), and again as a part of the theatre's millennium celebration in 2000. The productions won Bill Bryden the \"Best Director\" title in both the Evening Standard Theatre Awards and the Olivier Awards for 1985, the year the three plays first appeared together in performance at the Lyceum Theatre. An adaptation of Harrison's play was staged at Shakespeare's Globe in 2011 as \"The Globe Mysteries\". \n\nIn 2001, the Isango Ensemble produced an African version of the Chester Cycle at the Garrick Theatre in London as \"The Mysteries – Yiimimangaliso\", performing in a combination of the Xhosa language, the Zulu language, English, Latin and Afrikaans. They revived an adapted version of the production at Shakespeare's Globe in 2015 as \"The Mysteries\". In 2004, two mystery plays (one focusing on the Creation and the other on the Passion) were performed at Canterbury Cathedral, with actor Edward Woodward in the role of God. The large cast also included Daniel MacPherson, Thomas James Longley and Joseph McManners.\n\nThe first modern stage production of \"Everyman\" did not appear until July 1901, when The Elizabethan Stage Society of William Poel gave three outdoor performances at the Charterhouse in London. Poel then partnered with British actor Ben Greet to produce the play throughout Britain, with runs on the American Broadway stage from 1902 to 1918, and concurrent tours throughout North America. These productions differed from past performances in that women were cast in the title role, rather than men. Film adaptations of the 1901 version of the play appeared in 1913 and 1914, with the 1913 film being presented with an early color two-process pioneered by Kinemacolor.\n\nAnother well-known version of the play is \"Jedermann\" by the Austrian playwright Hugo von Hofmannsthal, which has been performed annually at the Salzburg Festival since 1920. The Hofmannsthal play was made into a film of the same title in 1961. Frederick Franck published a modernised version of the tale entitled \"Everyone\", drawing on Buddhist influence. A direct-to-video movie version of \"Everyman\" was made in 2002, directed by John Farrell, which updated the setting to the early 21st century, including Death as a businessman in dark glasses with a briefcase, and Goods being played by a talking personal computer.\n\nA modernized adaptation by Carol Ann Duffy, the Poet Laureate, with Chiwetel Ejiofor in the title role, was performed at the National Theatre (UK) from April to July 2015.\n\nPerformances of plays outside of churches are frequent during the Christmas season with reenactments of the Nativity, and many Christian schools and Sunday school groups regularly performs scenes from the bible with children. The reenactment of the Passion of Christ is performed throughout the world in the late Lenten season.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10896786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10896786", "title": "Melissa King assault case", "text": "Melissa King assault case\n\nThe Melissa King assault case was an incident in Cleveland, Ohio when personal animosity between two girls led to an alleged attack by eighteen black and Hispanic youths aged between eight and fifteen on a thirteen-year-old white girl named Melissa King. Of the eighteen children, six were convicted. Although there were allegations that this was part of a customary \"Beat up a White Kid\" day, both prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed that the incident arose from a vendetta between two girls.\n\nOn May 1, 2003, school officials and students at Wilbur Wright Middle School separately notified police that \"a large fight\" was planned for after school near the intersection of Almira Avenue and West 110th street in Cleveland, Ohio. Initially, it was believed that police arrived as the attack was under way. However, two police cars were there prior to the attack and when school let out, they saw a large group of students walking in the street on West 110th. From their automobiles, the police warned them to walk on the sidewalk.\n\nSome of the students moved to block the police cars as part of the pre-planned attack. With the police kept at a distance, a pack of twelve girls and six boys, ages 9 through 15, began to run towards Melissa King, a 13-year-old white girl who was a student at Wilbur Wright and was walking home with two friends. \n\nOn reaching King, one girl grabbed King's hair from behind and yanked her to the ground. Then the black and Hispanic youths, 17 of whom were students at Wilbur Wright, beat, kicked, and choked her. As they pummeled and scratched at King, the attackers called her \"honky\", \"white trash\", and \"white bitch.\" One attacker was overheard saying, \"I hit her and got my stomp in.\"\n\nBy the time police broke up the attack, King had suffered serious injuries to her head, arms, face, neck, back, and an eye and experienced dizziness and blackouts that her mother claimed required repeated visits to the hospital. When the attackers were asked separately by the police officers why the victim was jumped, each one stated, \"It's May Day!\" They each went on to explain that May Day \"is the day blacks beat on whites\" and is known as \"beat up a white kid day.\" Others familiar with the attack said it wasn't personal, but that it was merely in keeping with the May Day tradition where minority children get a \"free shot\" at white children simply because of their race. However, defense lawyers and prosecutors both agreed that the attack sprang from a personal vendetta between Melissa and one girl. This girl testified that Melissa had overheard her talking to a school counselor after she was sexually abused and attempted suicide, and claimed Melissa had spread gossip about this. Within a few days of the attack, Wilbur Wright school responded by suspending five of the eighteen attackers from school for ten days.\n\nWhen the attack was publicized a day later in \"The Plain Dealer\", more than 100 readers contacted the newspaper to confirm that the May Day ritual had been alive and well for years. Many in their 20s recalled staying home sick from school on May Day in the 1990s or hurrying home to avoid getting hurt. Some teachers did not give homework that day because they knew attendance would be down. Although annual assaults on white children by minorities is rooted in certain public schools on Cleveland's West Side, the event may have multiple origins. For example, one man recalled that when he served in the military, many of his friends reported, participated in, or became victims of this annual ritual. \n\nIn June 2003, the juvenile justice unit of the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office filed felonious assault and aggravated riot juvenile charges against the eighteen attackers. Noting that the attack was some sort of May Day ritual with the \"focus to beat up a white kid,\" the juvenile justice unit also charged the attackers with ethnic intimidation—a hate-crimes law. In July, Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court Judge Joseph F. Russo entered not guilty pleas and appointed lawyers for the youth, and issued arrest warrants for the four who failed to attend the court hearing. \n\nJudge Russo ended the trial on October 2003 with six convictions. These six individuals admitted aggravated rioting, and two of those admitted to felonious assault. Judge Russo said that testimony from prosecution witnesses including Melissa was too conflicting, inconsistent and sometimes obviously false to prove the culpability of four defendants beyond reasonable doubt. However he concluded that \"based on the evidence I've heard, May Day is reality and the evidence was overwhelming that this was an attack based on May Day and that the victim was chosen because she was white.\" In drawing his conclusion, Judge Russo suggested that white students in Cleveland's integrated public schools have reason to fear assaults by minorities in so-called May Day attacks every May 1.\n"}

{"id": "8974224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8974224", "title": "Operation Time", "text": "Operation Time\n\n\"Operation Time\" is the eighth episode of \"Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons\", a 1960s British Supermarionation television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and produced by their company Century 21 Productions. Written by Richard Conway and Stephen J. Mattick and directed by Ken Turner, it was first broadcast on 17 November 1967 on ATV Midlands.\n\nIn this episode, the Mysterons threaten to \"kill time\", confusing Spectrum until the target is found to be a military general who is about to undergo pioneering brain surgery.\n\n\"Operation Time\" reveals two natural weaknesses in Mysteron reconstructions that are further explored in \"Spectrum Strikes Back\".\n\nWhen the Mysterons (voiced by Donald Gray) confusingly threaten to \"kill time\", Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) dispatches senior Spectrum personnel to major cities to watch for potential targets. No promising intelligence surfaces until Captain Magenta (voiced by Gary Files) discovers that the Commander of Western Region World Defence, General J.F. Tiempo – whose surname means \"time\" in Spanish – is at a clinic near London, where he is soon to undergo brain surgery. Believing that Tiempo's life is in danger, White has him flown to Cloudbase with his surgeon, Dr Magnus, who insists that the operation – to be carried out with the aid of a pioneering medical device called the \"cerebral pulsator\" – go ahead as planned. White reluctantly agrees and allows Magnus to use Cloudbase's sickbay as an operating theatre.\n\nUnknown to Spectrum, Magnus is a Mysteron reconstruction of the original doctor, who has been killed in a road accident engineered by Captain Black (voiced by Donald Gray). During the operation, the reconstruction deliberately overruns the cerebral pulsator to induce a fatal seizure in his masked patient. Dr Fawn (voiced by Charles Tingwell) then removes the mask to reveal the face of Captain Scarlet (voiced by Francis Matthews), who unknown to Magnus had substituted for Tiempo. Exposed as a Mysteron agent, Magnus breaks out of sickbay and flees to Cloudbase's electrical room, where he is cornered by Captain Blue (voiced by Ed Bishop) and dies when he comes into contact with a bare cable. During this time, an abnormality has appeared on one of Tiempo's pre-operative radiographs: Magnus's hand, which was accidentally caught in the image, has blocked the X-rays and is showing as flesh. With Tiempo safe and Scarlet once again revived, White announces that Spectrum will develop technology to exploit the Mysterons' imperviousness to X-rays and vulnerability to electricity.\n\nWriters Richard Conway and Stephen J. Mattick named Magnus's colleague, Dr Turner, after the episode's director, Ken Turner. In the script, Conway and Mattick suggested that Wexham Park Hospital could be used to record footage showing the development of Tiempo's radiographs. In the end, however, the episode was filmed entirely at Century 21's studios on the Slough Trading Estate.\n\nThe episode's incidental music was recorded during a four-and-a-half-hour studio session held on 14 May 1967, when it was performed by a 12-member ensemble conducted by series composer Barry Gray. The music for \"Renegade Rocket\" was recorded during the same session.\n\n\"Operation Time\" features voice actor Gary Files' first contributions to \"Captain Scarlet\". Files was unavailable for dialogue recording during the production of the first five episodes because he was providing voices for the film \"Thunderbird 6\", to which he had been signed on as a \"try-out\" for \"Captain Scarlet\".\n\nAndrew Pixley and Julie Rogers of \"Starburst\" magazine note the \"cryptic\" nature of the Mysterons' threat to \"kill time\", humorously remarking that it could \"[suggest] they'll be passing a few hours playing cards or watching \"Oprah\".\" They also consider the \"rather graphic\" electrocution of the reconstructed Magnus to be one of the series' more violent moments.\n\n"}

{"id": "43831935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43831935", "title": "Prince (painting)", "text": "Prince (painting)\n\nOrange Prince (1984) is a painting by American artist Andy Warhol, of Prince Rogers Nelson (1958–2016), the American singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist, actor, and director.\n\n\"Orange Prince\" \"(1984)\" is considered an important late work referencing Warhol's portraits from the early 1960s, of movie stars and celebrity icons, such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor and Jacqueline Kennedy. Art historian and Warhol expert Thomas E. Crow believes that Warhol's portrait of Prince shows much greater freedom of expression, as in the early portraits. This is especially evident when compared to Warhol's more 'factory-line' style of portraits from the 1970s onwards, which were mainly commissions. \n\nPrince did not commission the Warhol portraits, which stayed in Warhol's private collection until he died. Crow believes Warhol was fascinated by Prince, who was not in Warhol's direct circle. He says that Warhol was drawn to Prince's edgy image, which acted as inspiration for the art work:\"(Warhol's) evident fascination with Prince, known for sexual frankness in his music and an androgynous style in his clothes, make-up, and hairstyle, echoed similar traits among those he famously gathered around himself in the Factory entourage of the 1960s.\"\n\n\"Orange Prince\" uses a photograph as its source image, which depicts Prince in the burgeoning stages of his career in 1981, three years before the painting was created. The original color photograph shows Prince in a full length pose, from which Warhol isolated the head only for the portrait.\n\nThe composition of \"Orange Prince\" makes direct reference to the portraits Warhol produced in the 1960s, as Crow points out in his 2018 analysis of the painting, and is similar in composition to Warhol's Marilyn series where the subject's head 'floats' in day-glo color.\n\nAccording to Crow, the composition is distinct from other late portraits, the majority of which were commissions and followed a commercial formula, such as Warhol's portrait of Michael Jackson which was commissioned and created a few months before \"Orange Prince.\" As Crow says: \"Warhol’s 1984 portrait (of Prince)...harked back to the independently conceived celebrity likenesses of his earlier career (from the 1960s). As Prince had not commissioned any of the paintings, Warhol could experiment with far more variations in background patterns and colors.\"The face of the subject is depicted in a neon orange color, the same as the background. The facial outline, features and hair are in black. Highlights of green and blue are woven onto the screen amongst the black line around the subject's facial features, hair and ears. The overall effect is to make the subject luminesce, with a trade-mark Warhol flatness to the image, due partly to the very little graduation of shading.\n\nPrince and Andy Warhol were personally acquainted, as Warhol's diary entries show.\n\nOn a number of occasions in the early 1980s Prince had appeared in \"Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine\". In the April 1980 edition Prince appears in a full-page photograph by Robert Mapplethorpe.\n\nWarhol attended a number of Prince concerts in the 1980s, including one of the very earliest in New York. On December 9, 1980, Prince played The Ritz in New York as part of his \"Dirty Mind Tour\". The club was only half-full, but as music critic Nik Cohn reported, \"Andy Warhol and his claque showed up, and so did a number of music-biz faces. Before the show, they lounged in poses of practised cool. Then Prince appeared, and cool went up in flames\".\n\nIn the December 1981 edition of Warhol's \"Interview\" magazine Prince appears in a controversial image showing him in the shower, and a crucifix on the wall behind.\n\nIn Fall 1984, Warhol created \"Orange Prince\". Prince had released the \"Purple Rain\" album and movie that year and was well known internationally. \n\nOn August 2, 1986, Warhol was in the front row at Prince's concert at Madison Square Garden. In his diary entry of their meeting, Warhol described sitting down at the concert \"...just as Prince jumps out naked, or almost, and it's the greatest concert I've ever seen there, just so much energy and excitement.\"\n\nAfterwards at the New York dance club, The Palladium, Warhol reported that he was very excited to be invited to an after-party hosted by Prince, and fascinated by him. Warhol described arriving at the party and seeing Prince appear in the near-empty club \"...in a white coat and pink bellbottoms, like a Puerto Rican at a prom, all by himself\". He also stated Prince was a gracious host who remembered the names of the many individuals in Warhol's entourage that night, and how Prince made sure he danced with everyone.\n\nThe same party was also attended by Billy Idol; seeing Prince and Idol together, Warhol observed that \"Hollywood glamour girls\" such as Jean Harlow and Marilyn Monroe had been supplanted by \"glamour boys\" such as Prince and Idol—a development that Warhol found completely fascinating and \"...so weird\".\n\nThat night, Prince agreed to appear on the December 1986 cover of Warhol's Interview magazine, which Warhol described in his diary:\"We asked Prince if he would be our December cover and he said we'd have to talk to his manager and we said that we'd asked the manager and the manager said to ask him, and so they said they'd work it out. We were just shaking, it was so exciting.\"Warhol's portrait of Prince was created in 1984, two years before their post-concert meeting in 1986, and remained in Warhol's own collection until he died in 1987. \n\n\"Orange Prince\" was created using a complex tracing and silkscreening process, using layers of colors of silkscreen ink on top of a hand-painted orange ground of acrylic polymer paint, applied to canvas. The technique was popularised by Warhol, and is synonymous with the artist from the 1960s onwards, when he produced his early portraits of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando, and other Hollywood movie stars and celebrities of the time.\n\nThe 1989 MoMA catalogue of Warhol's work, includes a comprehensive description of Warhol's silkscreening technique, provided by the British curator and author Marco Livingstone under the title, “Do It Yourself: Notes on Warhol’s Technique.”A pencil tracing was taken from the full sized [transparent] acetate prepared for the photographic screen. Either by transferring the penciled line by pressing onto the front of the acetate or sheet of paper, or by placing a sheet of carbon paper beneath the tracing and then drawing the line one section at a time, a rough guide was established for each color area, for example, the lips and the eyelids. The colors were then brushed on by hand, often with the use of masking tape to create a clean junction between them, with the eventual imposition of the black screened image also serving to obscure any unevenness in the line. The acetates were examined by Warhol before they were made into screens, so that he could indicate by means of instructions, written and drawn with china-marking crayon, any changes to be made: for example, to increase the tonal contrast by removing areas of half-tone, thereby flattening the image. The position of the image would be established by taping the four corners of the acetate to the canvas and then tearing off the tape along the corner edges of the acetate; the fragments of tape remaining on the canvas would serve as a guide in locating the screen on top. The position of the screen would be confirmed by eye, and it would then be printed.\nA number of important silkscreen works by Andy Warhol use the color orange. Some of the first silkscreen works from the 1960s use orange as the dominant color, and Warhol continued to use orange in his paintings throughout his lifetime. \"Orange Prince\" shares a compositional style to \"Orange Marilyn\", 1962. A number of orange paintings by Warhol are in museum collections around the world: \n\nThe effect of bright colors in Warhol's work is to draw renewed focus to the subject matter. In the \"Death and Disaster\" series of paintings the graphic images Warhol took from tabloid newspaper stories of the time are a stark counterpoint to the candy-color palette. Another example of this is \"Twelve Electric Chairs\" from 1964, which consists of twelve highly contrasting colored images of the electric chair, including \"Orange Little Electric Chair,\" 1964.\n\nIn late 2017, a leading art industry newsletter, Baer Faxt, reported that Warhol’s Orange Marilyn sold in a private transaction for $250 million\n\nIn 2017 Prince's sister, Tyka Nelson, confirmed that Prince's favorite color was \"orange\", and not purple, as assumed. Also that Prince often wore all-orange stage outfits, had orange sets for concerts and his favorite item was his custom-built orange Cloud guitar.\n\nArt historian, Thomas Crow, believes Warhol depicts Prince as a \"modern-day icon\" in his painting, referencing religious iconographic paintings: \"[Warhol's portrait of Prince] returned Warhol to the origins of his art-critical credibility, that is, the flattened, emblematic, minimally descriptive manner that had characterized his first, definitive phase as an artist.\"\"Marilyn Diptych\", 1962, is an early example of iconography in Warhol's work, the image repeated many times to emphasise the ubiquity of celebrity and references a form of religious painting in its title.\n\nThe Marilyn \"Flavors\" portraits – thirteen unique paintings of Marilyn Monroe with different color backgrounds – are also amongst the first examples of Warhol's iconographic style, and graphic use of saturated block color, held by art historians to highlight a manufactured celebrity. Art historian Robert Rosenblum was personally close to Warhol and wrote about Warhol's Catholic religious observance, which informed Rosenblum's observation about the 1962 \"Gold Marilyn\" in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art: \"When Warhol took a photographic silkscreen of Marilyn Monroe’s head, set it on gold paint, and let it float high in a timeless, spaceless heaven..., he was creating, in effect, a secular saint for the 1960s that might well command as much earthly awe and veneration as, say, a Byzantine Madonna hovering for eternity on a gold mosaic ground.\"Geralyn Huxley, curator of film and video at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, believes Warhol's preoccupation with celebrity portraits and the style in which he depicts them, stems from the artist's religious upbringing. As a child Warhol attended a local Catholic church which featured an iconostasis, a screen situated in front of the altar featuring large-scale depictions of the faces of the Saints.\n\nArt historian Jane Daggett Dillenberger, in her book \"The Religious Art of Andy Warhol\", points out that Warhol's portraits of celebrities have a strong affinity with the sacred icons at the St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church in Pittsburgh: \"Andy's earliest experience of art was of religious art...for Andy, art and religion were linked.\"In his New York Times review of the 1989 Warhol retrospective exhibition at MoMA, art critic Michael Brenson says that Warhol's portraits, at their best, bring together diametrically opposite values, such as sensual excess and the purity of an icon, as seen in the portrait of Prince:“[Andy Warhol's] flat images, painted in a flat tone, existing in a non-space from which past and future have been banished ... make the present seem absolute and eternal—in other words, transcendent. Part of Warhol’s achievement was to legitimize his love of secular, profane subjects by attaching to them traditional religious values. ... Warhol argues that self-effacement and sensual excess, purity and trash, the moment and eternity can exist together.”\n\n\"Orange Prince\" painting has been reproduced in books, magazines and other media, most notably as the cover of a commemorative magazine published by Condé Nast just after Prince's death in 2016.\n\nThe portrait was featured in both the November 1984 and the April 2016 editions of \"Vanity Fair\", reproduced in color on a full page to illustrate the article entitled \"Purple Fame\", about Prince's rise to fame in the wake of his celebrated 1984 album and movie \"Purple Rain,\" the inspiration for Warhol's portrait.\n\nThe \"Vanity Fair\" article claims that Warhol's portrait of Prince captures the recording artist \"...at the height of his powers\" and is one of the first global pieces written as a critical appreciation of the musician, coinciding with the start of the recording artist's 98-date Purple Rain Tour. \"Purple Rain\" is frequently regarded as Prince's magnum opus; declaring that Prince had \"...finally arrived\", and Warhol's portrait shows Prince as a confident and celebrated musician, now on a world stage and internationally renowned.\n\n\"Orange Prince (1984)\" was reproduced on the front cover of \"The Genius of Prince\", a commemorative magazine published in the wake of the musician's sudden death just months before. The magazine was published as a US edition by Condé Nast, in June 2016, to wide acclaim and distributed internationally.\n\nThe portrait also features in \"Andy Warhol Treasures\", a book published in 2009 by Geralyn Huxley.\n\n\"Andy Warhol: Portraits\" at The Phoenix Art Museum,Arizona.\n\n\"Warhol Live\".

{"id": "517367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=517367", "title": "Qawwali", "text": "Qawwali\n\nQawwali (Nastaʿlīq: ; Punjabi: ; Hindi: क़व्वाली; Bangla: কাওয়ালি) is a form of Sufi devotional music originating from the Indian subcontinent, and notably popular in the Punjab and Sindh regions of Pakistan; in Hyderabad, Delhi and other parts of India, especially North India; as well as Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet divisions of Bangladesh. It is part of a musical tradition that stretches back for more than 700 years.\n\nOriginally performed at Sufi shrines or dargahs throughout South Asia, it gained mainstream popularity and International audience in late 20th century. Qawwali music received international exposure through the work of the late Pakistani singers Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Sabri Brothers, and Aziz Mian largely due to several releases on the Real World label, followed by live appearances at WOMAD festivals. Other famous Qawwali singers include Pakistan's Amjad Farid Sabri, Fareed Ayyaz & Abu Muhammad, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Badar Maindad, Rizwan & Moazzam Duo, Bahauddin Qutbuddin.\n\nDelhi's Sufi saint Amir Khusro Dehlavi of the Chisti order of Sufis is credited with fusing the Persian, Arabic, Turkish, and Indian musical traditions in the late 13th century in India to create Qawwali as we know it today. The word \"Sama\" is often still used in Central Asia and Turkey to refer to forms very similar to Qawwali, and in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the formal name used for a session of Qawwali is \"Mehfil-e-Sama\".\n\nQaul (Arabic: قَوْل) is an \"utterance (of the prophet)\", Qawwāl is someone who often repeats (sings) a Qaul, Qawwāli is what a Qawwāl sings.\n\n \n\nThe songs which constitute the qawwali repertoire are primarily in Persian, Urdu, Hindi, Bengali and Punjabi. There are some in Persian from the Mughal era, and a smattering in Saraiki and dialects of north India like Brajbhasha and Awadhi. There is also qawwali in some regional languages but the regional language tradition is relatively obscure. Also, the sound of the regional language qawwali can be totally different from that of mainstream qawwali. This is certainly true of Chhote Babu Qawwal, whose style of singing is much closer to the Bengali Baul music than to the qawwali of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, for example.\n\nThe poetry is implicitly understood to be spiritual in its meaning, even though the lyrics can sometimes sound wildly secular, or outright hedonistic. The central themes of qawwali are love, devotion and longing (of man for the Divine).\n\nQawwalis are classified by their content into several categories:\n\nA group of qawwali musicians, called a \"party\" (or Humnawa in Urdu), typically consists of eight or nine men including a lead singer, one or two side singers, one or two harmoniums (which may be played by the lead singer, side singer or someone else), and percussion. If there is only one percussionist, he plays the tabla and dholak, usually the tabla with the dominant hand and the dholak with the other one (i.e. a left-handed percussionist would play the tabla with his left hand). Often there will be two percussionists, in which case one might play the tabla and the other the dholak. There is also a chorus of four or five men who repeat key verses, and who aid percussion by hand-clapping.\n\nThe performers sit cross-legged on the ground in two rows — the lead singer, side singers and harmonium players in the front row, and the chorus and percussionists in the back row.\n\nBefore the fairly recent introduction of the harmonium, qawwalis were usually accompanied by the sarangi. The sarangi had to be retuned between songs; the harmonium didn't, and was soon preferred.\n\nWomen used to be excluded from traditional Muslim music, since they are traditionally prohibited from singing in the presence of men. These traditions have changed, however, as is evident by the popularity (and acceptance) of female singers such as Abida Parveen. However, qawwali has remained an exclusively male business. There are still no mainstream female qawwals. Although Abida Parveen performs many songs that are in the traditional qawwali repertoire, she does not perform them in the traditional qawwali style. Typically missing is the chorus which repeats key verses, as well as the handclapping.\n\nSongs are usually between 15 and 30 minutes long. However, the longest commercially released qawwali runs slightly over 115 minutes (Hashr Ke Roz Yeh Poochhunga by Aziz Mian Qawwal). The qawwali maestro Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan has at least two songs that are more than 60 minutes long.\n\nQawwalis tend to begin gently and build steadily to a very high energy level in order to induce hypnotic states both among the musicians and within the audience. Songs are usually arranged as follows:\n\n\nThe singing style of qawwali is different from Western singing styles in many ways. For example, in words beginning with an \"m\", Western singers are apt to stress the vowel following the \"m\" rather than the \"m\" itself, whereas in qawwali, the \"m\" will usually be held, producing a muted tone. Also in qawwali, there is no distinction between what is known as the chest voice and the head voice (the different areas that sound will resonate in depending on the frequency sung). Rather, qawwals sing very loudly and forcefully, which allows them to extend their chest voice to much higher frequencies than those used in Western singing, even though this usually causes a more noisy or strained sound than would be acceptable in the West.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3745201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3745201", "title": "Roman aqueduct", "text": "Roman aqueduct\n\nThe Romans constructed aqueducts throughout their Republic and later Empire, to bring water from outside sources into cities and towns. Aqueduct water supplied public baths, latrines, fountains, and private households; it also supported mining operations, milling, farms, and gardens.\n\nAqueducts moved water through gravity alone, along a slight overall downward gradient within conduits of stone, brick, or concrete; the steeper the gradient, the faster the flow. Most conduits were buried beneath the ground and followed the contours of the terrain; obstructing peaks were circumvented or, less often, tunneled through. Where valleys or lowlands intervened, the conduit was carried on bridgework, or its contents fed into high-pressure lead, ceramic, or stone pipes and siphoned across. Most aqueduct systems included sedimentation tanks, which helped reduce any water-borne debris. Sluices and \"castella aquae\" (distribution tanks) regulated the supply to individual destinations. In cities and towns, the run-off water from aqueducts scoured the drains and sewers.\n\nRome's first aqueduct was built in 312 BC, and supplied a water fountain at the city's cattle market. By the 3rd century AD, the city had eleven aqueducts, sustaining a population of over a million in a water-extravagant economy; most of the water supplied the city's many public baths. Cities and towns throughout the Roman Empire emulated this model, and funded aqueducts as objects of public interest and civic pride, \"an expensive yet necessary luxury to which all could, and did, aspire\".\n\nMost Roman aqueducts proved reliable and durable; some were maintained into the early modern era, and a few are still partly in use. Methods of aqueduct surveying and construction are noted by Vitruvius in his work \"De Architectura\" (1st century BC). The general Frontinus gives more detail in his official report on the problems, uses and abuses of Imperial Rome's public water supply. Notable examples of aqueduct architecture include the supporting piers of the Aqueduct of Segovia, and the aqueduct-fed cisterns of Constantinople.\n\nBefore the development of aqueduct technology, Romans, like most of their contemporaries in the ancient world, relied on local water sources such as springs and streams, supplemented by groundwater from privately or publicly owned wells, and by seasonal rain-water drained from rooftops into storage jars and cisterns. The reliance of ancient communities upon such water resources restricted their potential growth. Rome's aqueducts were not strictly Roman inventions – their engineers would have been familiar with the water-management technologies of Rome's Etruscan and Greek allies – but they proved conspicuously successful. By the early Imperial era, the city's aqueducts supported a population of over a million, and an extravagant water supply for public amenities had become a fundamental part of Roman life. The run-off of aqueduct water scoured the sewers of cities and towns. Water from aqueducts was also used to supply villas, ornamental urban and suburban gardens, market gardens, farms, and agricultural estates, the latter being the core of Rome's economy and wealth.\n\nRome had several springs within its perimeter walls but its groundwater was notoriously unpalatable; water from the river Tiber was badly affected by pollution and waterborne diseases. The city's demand for water had probably long exceeded its local supplies by 312 BC, when the city's first aqueduct, the Aqua Appia, was commissioned by the censor Appius Claudius Caecus. The Aqua Appia was one of two major public projects of the time; the other was a military road between Rome and Capua, the first leg of the so-called Appian Way. Both projects had significant strategic value, as the Third Samnite War had been under way for some thirty years by that point. The road allowed rapid troop movements; and by design or fortunate coincidence, most of the Aqua Appia ran within a buried conduit, relatively secure from attack. It was fed by a spring 16.4 km from Rome, and dropped 10 metres over its length to discharge approximately 75,500 cubic metres of water each day into a fountain at Rome's cattle market, the Forum Boarium, one of the city's lowest-lying public spaces.\n\nA second aqueduct, the Aqua Anio Vetus, was commissioned some forty years later, funded by treasures seized from Pyrrhus of Epirus. Its flow was more than twice that of the Aqua Appia, and it entered the city on raised arches, supplying water to higher elevations of the city.\n\nBy 145 BC, the city had again outgrown its combined supplies. An official commission found the aqueduct conduits decayed, their water depleted by leakage and illegal tapping. The praetor Quintus Marcius Rex restored them, and introduced a third, \"more wholesome\" supply, the Aqua Marcia, Rome's longest aqueduct and high enough to supply the Capitoline Hill. The works cost 180,000,000 sesterces, and took two years to complete. As demand grew still further, more aqueducts were built, including the Aqua Tepula in 127 BC and the Aqua Julia in 33 BC. Aqueduct-building programmes reached a peak in the Imperial Era. Augustus' reign saw the building of the Aqua Virgo, and the short Aqua Alsietina that supplied Trastevere's artificial lake with water for staged sea-fights to entertain the populace. Another short Augustan aqueduct supplemented the Aqua Marcia with water of \"excellent quality\". The emperor Caligula added or began two aqueducts completed by his successor Claudius; the 69 km (42.8 mile) Aqua Claudia, which gave good quality water but failed on several occasions; and the Anio Novus, highest of all Rome's aqueducts and one of the most reliable but prone to muddy, discoloured waters, particularly after rain, despite its use of settling tanks.\n\nMost of Rome's aqueducts drew on various springs in the valley and highlands of the Anio, the modern river Aniene, east of the Tiber. A complex system of aqueduct junctions, tributary feeds and distribution tanks supplied every part of the city. Trastevere, the city region west of the Tiber, was primarily served by extensions of several of the city's eastern aqueducts, carried across the river by lead pipes buried in the roadbed of the river bridges, thus forming an inverted siphon. Whenever this cross-river supply had to be shut down for routine repair and maintenance works, the \"positively unwholesome\" waters of the Aqua Alsietina were used to supply Trastevere's public fountains. The situation was finally ameliorated when the emperor Trajan built the Aqua Traiana in 109 AD, bringing clean water directly to Trastavere from aquifers around Lake Bracciano.\nBy the late 3rd century AD, the city was supplied with water by 11 state-funded aqueducts. Their combined conduit length is estimated between 780 and a little over 800 kilometres, of which approximately were carried above ground level, on masonry supports. They supplied around 1 million cubic metres (300 million gallons) a day: a capacity 126% of the current water supply of the city of Bangalore, which has a population of 10 million.\n\n\nHundreds of similar aqueducts were built throughout the Roman Empire. Many of them have since collapsed or been destroyed, but a number of intact portions remain. The Zaghouan Aqueduct is in length. It was built in the 2nd century to supply Carthage (in modern Tunisia). Surviving aqueduct bridges include the Pont du Gard in France and the Aqueduct of Segovia in Spain. The longest single conduit, at over 240 km, is associated with the Valens Aqueduct of Constantinople (Mango 1995). \"The known system is at least two and half times the length of the longest recorded Roman aqueducts at Carthage and Cologne, but perhaps more significantly it represents one of the most outstanding surveying achievements of any pre-industrial society\". Rivalling this in terms of length and possibly equaling or exceeding it in cost and complexity, is the provincial Aqua Augusta that supplied an entire region, which contained at least eight cities, including the major ports at Naples and Misenum; sea voyages by traders and the Roman navy required copious supplies of fresh water.\n\nWhether state-funded or privately built, aqueducts were protected and regulated by law. Any proposed aqueduct had to be submitted to the scrutiny of civil authorities. Permission (from the senate or local authorities) was granted only if the proposal respected the water rights of other citizens; on the whole, Roman communities took care to allocate shared water resources according to need. The land on which a state-funded aqueduct was built might be state land (\"ager publicus\") or privately owned, but in either case was subject to restrictions on usage and encroachment that might damage the fabric of the aqueduct. To this end, state funded aqueducts reserved a wide corridor of land, up to 15 feet each side of the aqueduct's outer fabric. Ploughing, planting and building were prohibited within this boundary. Such regulation was necessary to the aqueduct's long-term integrity and maintenance but was not always readily accepted or easily enforced at a local level, particularly when \"ager publicus\" was understood to be common property. Some privately built or smaller municipal aqueducts may have required less stringent and formal arrangements.\n\nSprings were by far the most common sources for aqueduct water; for example, most of Rome's supply came from various springs in the Anio valley and its uplands. Spring-water was fed into a stone or concrete springhouse, then entered the aqueduct conduit. Scattered springs would require several branch conduits feeding into a main channel. Some systems drew water from open, purpose-built, dammed reservoirs, such as the two (still in use) that supplied the aqueduct at the provincial city of Emerita Augusta.\n\nThe territory over which the aqueduct ran had to be carefully surveyed to ensure the water would flow at an acceptable gradient for the entire distance. Roman engineers used various surveying tools to plot the course of aqueducts across the landscape. They checked horizontal levels with a \"chorobates\", a flatbedded wooden frame fitted with a water level. They plotted courses and angles could be plotted and checked using a \"groma\", a relatively simple apparatus that was probably displaced by the more sophisticated dioptra, precursor of the modern theodolite. In Book 8 of his De Architectura, Vitruvius describes the need to ensure a constant supply, methods of prospecting, and tests for potable water.\n\nGreek and Roman physicians knew the association between stagnant or tainted waters and water-borne disease. They also knew the adverse health effects of lead on those who mined and processed it, and for this reason, ceramic pipes were preferred over lead. Where lead pipes were used, a continuous water-flow and the inevitable deposition of water-borne minerals within the pipes somewhat reduced the water's contamination by soluble lead. Nevertheless, the level of lead in this water was 100 times higher than in local spring waters.\n\nMost Roman aqueducts were flat-bottomed, arch-section conduits that ran 0.5 to 1 m beneath the ground surface, with inspection-and-access covers at regular intervals. Conduits above ground level were usually slab-topped. Early conduits were ashlar-built but from around the late Republican era, brick-faced concrete was often used instead. The concrete used for conduit linings was usually waterproof. The flow of water depended on gravity alone. The volume of water transported within the conduit depended on the catchment hydrology – rainfall, absorption, and runoff – the cross section of the conduit, and its gradient; most conduits ran about two-thirds full. The conduit's cross section was also determined by maintenance requirements; workmen must be able to enter and access the whole, with minimal disruption to its fabric.\n\nVitruvius recommends a low gradient of not less than 1 in 4800 for the channel, presumably to prevent damage to the structure through erosion and water pressure. This value agrees well with the measured gradients of surviving masonry aqueducts. The gradient of the Pont du Gard is only 34 cm per km, descending only 17 m vertically in its entire length of : it could transport up to 20,000 cubic metres a day. The gradients of temporary aqueducts used for hydraulic mining could be considerably greater, as at Dolaucothi in Wales (with a maximum gradient of about 1:700) and Las Medulas in northern Spain. Where sharp gradients were unavoidable in permanent conduits, the channel could be stepped downwards, widened or discharged into a receiving tank to disperse the flow of water and reduce its abrasive force. The use of stepped cascades and drops also helped re-oxygenate and thus \"freshen\" the water.\n\nSome aqueduct conduits were supported across valleys or hollows on arches of masonry, brick or concrete; the Pont du Gard, one of the most impressive surviving examples of a massive masonry multiple-piered conduit, spanned the Gardon river-valley some 48.8 m (160 ft) above the Gardon itself. Where particularly deep or lengthy depressions had to be crossed, inverted siphons could be used, instead of arched supports; the conduit fed water into a header tank, which fed it into pipes. The pipes crossed the valley at lower level, supported by a low \"venter\" bridge, then rose to a receiving tank at a slightly lower elevation. This discharged into another conduit; the overall gradient was maintained. Siphon pipes were usually made of soldered lead, sometimes reinforced by concrete encasements or stone sleeves. Less often, the pipes themselves were stone or ceramic, jointed as male-female and sealed with lead. Vitruvius describes the construction of siphons and the problems of blockage, blow-outs and venting at their lowest levels, where the pressures were greatest. Nonetheless, siphons were versatile and effective if well-built and well-maintained. A horizontal section of high-pressure siphon tubing in the Aqueduct of the Gier was ramped up on bridgework to clear a navigable river, using nine lead pipes in parallel, cased in concrete. Modern hydraulic engineers use similar techniques to enable sewers and water pipes to cross depressions. At Arles, a minor branch of the main aqueduct supplied a local suburb via a lead siphon whose \"belly\" was laid across a riverbed, eliminating any need for supporting bridgework.\n\nRoman aqueducts required a comprehensive system of regular maintenance. The \"clear corridors\" created to protect the fabric of underground and overground conduits were regularly patrolled for unlawful ploughing, planting, roadways and buildings. Frontinus describes the penetration of conduits by tree-roots as particularly damaging. The aqueducts conduits would have been regularly inspected and maintained by working patrols, to reduce algal fouling, repair accidental breaches, to clear the conduits of gravel and other loose debris, and to remove channel-narrowing accretions of calcium carbonate in systems fed by hard water sources. Inspection and access points were provided at regular intervals on the standard, buried conduits. Accretions within syphons could drastically reduce flow rates, due to the already narrow diameter of their pipes. Some had sealed openings that might have been used as rodding eyes, possibly using a pull-through device. In Rome, where a hard-water supply was the norm, mains pipework was shallowly buried beneath road kerbs, for ease of access; the accumulation of calcium carbonate in these pipes would have necessitated their frequent replacement.\n\nThe aqueducts were under the overall care and governance of a water commissioner (\"curator aquarum\"). It was a high status, high-profile appointment. In 97, Frontinus served both as consul and as \"curator aquarum\", under the emperor Nerva. Little is known of the day-to-day business of aqueduct maintenance teams (\"aquarii\"). Under the emperor Claudius, Rome's contingent of imperial \"aquarii\" comprised a \"familia aquarum\" of 700 persons, both slave and free, funded through a combination of Imperial largesse and water taxes. They were supervised by an Imperial freedman, who held office as \"procurator aquarium\". Theirs was probably a never-ending routine of patrol, inspection and cleaning, punctuated by occasional emergencies. Full closure of any aqueduct for servicing would have been a rare event, kept as brief as possible, with repairs preferably made when water demand was lowest, which was presumably at night. The water supply could be shut off at its aqueduct outlet when small or local repairs were needed, but substantial maintenance and repairs to the aqueduct conduit itself required the complete diversion of water at any point upstream or at the spring-head itself.\n\nAqueduct mains could be directly tapped, but they more usually fed into public distribution terminals, known as \"castella aquae\", which supplied various branches and spurs, usually via large-bore lead or ceramic pipes. Thereafter, the supply could be further subdivided. Licensed, fee-paying private users would have been registered, along with the bore of pipe that led from the public water supply to their private property – the wider the pipe, the greater the flow and the higher the fee. Tampering and fraud to avoid or reduce payment were commonplace; methods included the fitting of unlicensed outlets, additional outlets, and the illegal widening of lead pipes; any of which might involve the bribery or connivance of unscrupulous aqueduct officials or workers. Official lead pipes carried inscriptions with information on the pipe's manufacturer, its fitter, and probably on its subscriber and their entitlement. During the Imperial era, lead production became an Imperial monopoly, and the granting of rights to draw water for private use from state-funded aqueducts was made an imperial privilege.\n\nRome's first aqueduct (312 BC) discharged at very low pressure and at a more-or-less constant rate in the city's main trading centre and cattle-market, probably into a low-level, cascaded series of troughs or basins; the upper for household use, the lower for watering the livestock traded there. Most Romans would have filled buckets and storage jars at the basins, and carried the water to their apartments; the better off would have sent slaves to perform the same task. The outlet's elevation was too low to offer any city household or building a direct supply; the overflow drained into Rome's main sewer, and from there into the Tiber. At this time, Rome had no public baths. The first were probably built in the next century, based on precursors in neighboring Campania; a limited number of private baths and small, street-corner public baths would have had a private water supply, but once aqueduct water was brought to the city's higher elevations, large and well-appointed public baths were built throughout the city, and drinking water was delivered to public fountains at high pressure. Public baths and fountains became distinctive features of Roman civilization, and the baths in particular became important social centres.\n\nThe majority of urban Romans lived in multi-storeyed blocks of flats (\"insulae\"). Some blocks offered water services, but only to tenants on the more expensive, lower floors; the rest would have drawn their water \"gratis\" from public fountains.\nBetween 65 and 90% of the Roman Empire's population was involved in some form of agricultural work. Farmers whose villas or estates were near a public aqueduct could draw, under license, a specified quantity of aqueduct water for summer irrigation at a predetermined time; this was intended to limit the depletion of water supply to users further down the gradient, and help ensure a fair distribution among competitors at the time when water was most needed and scarce. Water was possibly the most important variable in the agricultural economy of the Mediterranean world. Roman Italy's natural water sources – springs, streams, rivers and lakes – were unevenly distributed across the landscape, and water tended to scarcity when most needed, during the warm, dry summer growing season. Columella recommends that any farm should contain a spring, stream or river; but acknowledges that not every farm did.\n\nFarmland without a reliable summer water-source was virtually worthless. During the growing season, the water demand of a \"modest local\" irrigation system might consume as much water as the city of Rome; and the livestock whose manure fertilised the fields must be fed and watered all year round. At least some Roman landowners and farmers relied in part or whole on aqueduct water to raise crops as their primary or sole source of income but the fraction of aqueduct water involved can only be guessed at. More certainly, the creation of municipal and city aqueducts brought a growth in the intensive and efficient suburban market-farming of fragile, perishable commodities such as flowers (for perfumes, and for festival garlands), grapes, vegetables and orchard fruits; and of small livestock such as pigs and chickens, close to the municipal and urban markets.\n\nA licensed right to aqueduct water on farmland could lead to increased productivity, a cash income through the sale of surplus foodstuffs, and an increase in the value of the land itself. In the countryside, permissions to draw aqueduct water for irrigation were particularly hard to get; the exercise and abuse of such rights were subject to various known legal disputes and judgements, and at least one political campaign; in the early 2nd century BC Cato tried to block all unlawful rural outlets, especially those owned by the landed elite - \"Look how much he bought the land for, where he is channeling the water!\" - during his censorship. His attempted reform proved impermanent at best. Though illegal tapping could be punished by seizure of assets, including the illegally watered land and its produce, this law seems never to have been used, and was probably impracticable; food surpluses kept prices low. Grain shortages in particular could lead to famine and social unrest. Any practical solution must strike a balance between the water-needs of urban populations and grain producers, tax the latter's profits, and secure sufficient grain at reasonable cost for the Roman poor (the so-called \"corn dole\") and the army. Rather than seek to impose unproductive and probably unenforcable bans, the authorities issued individual water grants (though seldom in rural areas) and licenses, and regulated water outlets, with variable success. In the 1st century AD, Pliny the Elder, like Cato, could fulminate against grain producers who continued to wax fat on profits from public water and public land.\n\nSome landholders avoided such restrictions and entanglements by buying water access rights to distant springs, not necessarily on their own land. A few, of high wealth and status, built their own aqueducts to transport such water from source to field or villa; Mumius Niger Valerius Vegetus bought the rights to a spring and its water from his neighbour, and access rights to a corridor of intervening land, then built an aqueduct of just under 10 kilometres, connecting the springhead to his own villa. The senatorial permission for this \"Aqua Vegetiana\" was given only when the project seemed not to impinge on the water rights of other citizens.\n\nSome aqueducts supplied water to industrial sites, usually via an open channel cut into the ground, clay lined or wood-shuttered to reduce water loss. Most such leats were designed to operate at the steep gradients that could deliver the high water volumes needed in mining operations. Water was used in hydraulic mining to strip the overburden and expose the ore by hushing, to fracture and wash away metal-bearing rock already heated and weakened by fire-setting, and to power water-wheel driven stamps and trip-hammers that crushed ore for processing. Evidence of such leats and machines has been found at Dolaucothi in south-west Wales.\n\nMining sites such as Dolaucothi and Las Medulas in northwest Spain show multiple aqueducts that fed water from local rivers to the mine head. The channels may have deteriorated rapidly, or become redundant as the nearby ore was exhausted. Las Medulas shows at least seven such leats, and Dolaucothi at least five. At Dolaucothi, the miners used holding reservoirs as well as hushing tanks, and sluice gates to control flow, as well as drop chutes for diversion of water supplies. The remaining traces (see palimpsest) of such channels allows the mining sequence to be inferred.\n\nA number of other sites fed by several aqueducts have not yet been thoroughly explored or excavated, such as those at Longovicium near Lanchester south of Hadrian's wall, in which the water supplies may have been used to power trip-hammers for forging iron.\n\nAt Barbegal in Roman Gaul, a reservoir fed an aqueduct that drove a cascaded series of 15 or 16 overshot water mills, grinding flour for the Arles region. Similar arrangements, though on a lesser scale, have been found in Caesarea, Venafrum and Roman-era Athens. Rome's Aqua Traiana drove a flour-mill at the Janiculum, west of the Tiber. A mill in the basement of the Baths of Caracalla was driven by aqueduct overspill; this was but one of many city mills driven by aqueduct water, with or without official permission. A law of the 5th century forbade the illicit use of aqueduct water for milling.\n\nDuring the fall of the Roman Empire, some aqueducts were deliberately cut by enemies but more fell into disuse because of deteriorating Roman infrastructure and lack of maintenance, such as the Eifel aqueduct (\"pictured right\"). Observations made by the Spaniard Pedro Tafur, who visited Rome in 1436, reveal misunderstandings of the very nature of the Roman aqueducts:\nDuring the Renaissance, the standing remains of the city's massive masonry aqueducts inspired architects, engineers and their patrons; Pope Nicholas V renovated the main channels of the Roman \"Aqua Virgo\" in 1453. Many aqueducts in Rome's former empire were kept in good repair. The 15th-century rebuilding of aqueduct at Segovia in Spain shows advances on the Pont du Gard by using fewer arches of greater height, and so greater economy in its use of the raw materials. The skill in building aqueducts was not lost, especially of the smaller, more modest channels used to supply water wheels. Most such mills in Britain were developed in the medieval period for bread production, and used similar methods as that developed by the Romans with leats tapping local rivers and streams.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9753514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9753514", "title": "Saint Amaro", "text": "Saint Amaro\n\nAccording to Catholic tradition, Saint Amaro or Amarus the Pilgrim (, ) was an abbot and sailor who it was claimed sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to an earthly paradise. There are two historical figures who may have provided the basis for this legend. The first was a French penitent of the same name who went on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in the thirteenth century. On his return journey, he established himself at Burgos, where he founded a hospital for lepers.\n\nSaint Amaro has also been identified with Saint Maurus, disciple of Saint Benedict, who founded the first Benedictine monastery in France.\n\nAround the historical character of Saint Amaro converged many Pagan traditions present in Asturias and Galicia related with Gaelic \"immrama\" and \"echtrai\" like the voyages of Mael Dúin, the Úi Chorra, Snegdus and Mac Riagla or Bran mac Febal. Many features of the Celtic Otherworld are present in the Periplus of Saint Amaro.\n\nLike Saint Brendan, Amaro is said to have travelled on a journey that echoes that of the Irish \"immram\" –the voyages to the paradisiacal islands of the West. An edition of the \"Life of Saint Amaro\" was published at Burgos in 1552.\n\nHis legend holds that Amaro was a noble Catholic from Asia who was obsessed with the idea of visiting the earthly paradise. With this goal in mind, he would inquire for more information from his guests. Amaro was not successful in receiving information from them and was quite desperate and anguished about this until one night, God appeared to him and revealed how to reach his objective. Amaro would have to build a boat and follow the path of the sun across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAmaro took to the sea with some companions and sailed for six days and seven nights until he reached an island. This was an extremely fertile land that was blessed with five cities inhabited by uncouth men –though the women were quite beautiful.\n\nAmaro spent six months there until he heard a voice in his dreams telling him to depart the island. Amaro sailed through the \"Red Sea\" until he reached the land of a beautiful fountain, where the people were beautiful and lived peaceful lives that lasted three hundred years. Amaro remained there for three weeks until an old woman advised that he leave the island before he became accustomed to the good life.\n\nThey sailed for a long time into the vast unknown until they saw several vessels that they thought could assist them. Unfortunately, they found that these vessels had been invaded by monsters, which had killed the sailors and taken their bodies down to the depths of the ocean. Amaro was rescued by an apparition of a group of women, who advised him to empty his bottles of wine and oil into the sea, and then fill the bottles with air. Amaro did this and was rescued from this \"Mar Cuajado\" (lit. \"Still Sea\"; the Doldrums).\n\nThree days later they arrived at another desert island, which was inhabited by savage beasts hostile to man. There they found a hermit who informed them that the beasts there annihilated themselves by fighting one another on the day of Saint John; the stench of the corpses persisted throughout the year. The hermit provided them with supplies and recommended that they sail East, where there was a beautiful land that would satisfy all of their needs.\n\nThey sailed the next day and arrived in the afternoon, finding a monastery named Valdeflores. A monk from this monastery, Leonites, greeted them and told Amaro that he was waiting for him: he was already informed of their arrival by means of a vision. Leonites provided Amaro with instructions on how to reach the Earthly Paradise.\n\nWith Leonites, Amaro and his companions arrived at a natural harbor where they remained for a month, after which they traveled to an extensive and rugged valley, where Amaro will find what he was looking for: the Earthly Paradise. First, however, Amaro stumbled upon a nunnery situated high upon a mountaintop called \"Flor de Dueñas\" (Flower of Ladies).\n\nHe remained there, receiving further instructions on how to reach Paradise from a holy woman named Baralides. He is presented with a white habit. This is given to him by Brígida (Bridget), the niece of Baralides who lives in Paradise. Unfortunately, Leonites began to cry: he's losing a dear friend. But Baralides appears, and comforts Leonites with a gift. She presents him with a branch of one of the two magical trees of the Earthly Paradise.\n\nIn Paradise, Amaro found an enormous castle built from gems and precious metals, with battlements of gold and towers of rubies, walls made with multicolored bricks.\n\nThe castle’s gatekeeper informed Amaro that the castle was the Earthly Paradise, and thus no living being can enter it. The saint begged the gatekeeper to allow him to look at Paradise through the keyhole. Amaro was allowed to do this, and saw many things, including the Tree of life from which Adam ate; a primeval and eternal garden; enormous trees; birds whose song was so beautiful one could remain entranced by it for a thousand years; young musicians playing strange and unknown musical instruments; beautiful ladies adorned with a crown of flowers and dressed in white; the Virgin Mary, who accompanied these young ladies.\n\nSaint Amaro begged to be allowed in; the gatekeeper refused and informed him that during the saint's viewing of Paradise, three hundred years have passed. Amaro returned to the coast to find his companions gone and a city named after him built there.\n\nAmaro told the city’s inhabitants his story and they built him a house alongside the monastery of Valdeflores, where he lived for a number of years until he died. He was buried alongside Baralides and Brígida.\n\nThere are a number of hermitages dedicated to Amaro in Spain. There is a hermitage dedicated to Amaro in Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife (\"Ermita de San Amaro\"). The town of San Amaro in Ourense province is named after him.\n\nHis cult was also diffused in Portugal, where he is called \"Santo Amaro\". In the districts of Coimbra and Viseu, Saint Amaro is brought pinecones, nuts, and dry figs as an ex-voto offering — but he only accepts these items if they have been stolen. Saint Matthew, Saint Simon, and Saint Bartholomew are also brought things that have been stolen. He is also venerated with an annual religious festival in the parish of Ponta Delgada.\n\nAt Beja, the whitewashed church of Santo Amaro is one of just four pre-Romanesque churches left in Portugal. Some parts date from the sixth century and the interior columns and capitals are carved with foliages and geometric designs from the seventh century.\n\n\n"}

Every word has a variety of senses and connotations, which can be added, removed, or altered over time, often to the extent that cognates across space and time have very different meanings.

{"id": "19108364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19108364", "title": "Urban Interventionism", "text": "Urban Interventionism\n\nUrban Interventionism is a name sometimes given to a number of different kinds of activist design and art practices, art that typically responds to the social community, locational identity, the built environment, and public places. The goals are often to create new awareness of social issues, and to stimulate community involvement. Such practices have a history that includes certain street artists of the 1960s, such as The Diggers of San Francisco, or the Provos of Amsterdam, among many others.\n\nContemporary artists often associated with urban interventionist practices are Daniel Buren, Gordon Matta-Clark, Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Krzysztof Wodiczko, Thomas Hirschhorn, Francis Alÿs, Harrell Fletcher, the Red Peristyle group, Banksy and many others.\n\nUrban Interventionism has been associated with a changed understanding of the relationship between the social and the spatial, called the \"spatial turn\" of the arts and sciences in the 1980s. In this turn a new viewpoint was taken on public and urban spaces \"...whereby urban spaces are seen not merely as containers for or outcomes of social processes, but as a medium through which they unfold and as having constitutive significance .\" According to this train of thought the spatial sights of a city have the power to shape interactions and create new experiences. This power is utilized by urban interventions through the works created by the artists.\n\nUrban interventionism often target local communities as their targets. There are different strands of activity within urban interventionism. While mostly activistic, many artists have different focus points. George Yúdice, Professor of American Studies Program\nand of Spanish and Portuguese at New York University, defines the term as referring to \"public or participatory art through which publics constitute themselves and experience something extraordinary in the process. The famous street artist Banksy, for example, has done a few famous urban interventions. Some of these are political statements, like his stencil of a girl using balloons filled with helium to float over the wall between Palestine and Israel. Professor David Pinder of the University of London stated that urban interventions are often specifically directed towards the urban space that it is situated in: \"\"(urban interventions)...are typically concerned less with representing political issues than with intervening in urban spaces so as to question, refunction and contest prevailing norms and ideologies, and to create new meanings, experiences, understandings, relationships and situations.\" An example of a more situational urban intervention is the RedBall project by Kurt Perschke. The project consists of a large inflatable red ball that has been set up at many different sites worldwide, providing a new engaging space for people to interact with.\n\nMuch of the work is multidisciplinary and intermedial, combining art forms or creating works that are hard to classify. Artists working in this international vein often utilize outdoor video projection, found objects, sculptural artifacts, posters, and performance events that might include and involve passersby on the street. Urban interventions are not first objects to pursue the creation of meaning in urban space through the combination of art forms, and they have been linked to artists and philosophers of the 1960's. In 1968 philosopher and sociologist Henri Lefebvre wrote the \"Le Droit à la ville\" (Right to the City), in which he states that: \n\nThis also echoes other art forms that are connected to urban interventionalism like the 1960's Happenings and Richard Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk. These also saw urban space as a medium, bringing art into peoples' daily lives.\n\n\n"}

Representing a Viennese style, the Vienna Ice Revue was different from the competitor enterprise Holiday On Ice. In 1971 the Vienna Ice Revue was sold to Holiday On Ice and put on the back burner two years later.\n\nThe Wiener Eisrevue (Vienna Ice Revue) had its roots in the success story of Austrian figure skaters before World War II. Karl Schäfer, winner of eight European titles, seven World titles and two Olympic gold medals, was the most successful of these skaters. He had a show that was named after him, the Karl Schäfer-Eisrevue, which also played a major role in the movie “Der weiße Traum” (“The White Dream”) in 1943. From an artistic point of view, this show was the forerunner of the Vienna Ice Revue.\n\nIn 1945, some months after the ending of World War II, the Wiener Eisrevue was founded. Will Petter, the “creator” of the Vienna Ice Revue, and his wife Edith who evolved into the revue's choreographer, carried out their idea of replacing “cold spots” with a story line. In 1952, Robert Stolz began to transpose this concept into music. He was destined to compose 19 “ice operettas” for the Vienna Ice Revue. Music by other composers was also integrated into the program. Most notably, the Blue Danube Waltz by Johann Strauß was played at the end of most productions. In one of the first New Year's Concerts with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra to be broadcast on TV, the Vienna Ice revue danced one of the waltzes.\n\nThe Vienna Ice Revue toured through most European countries including Switzerland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, France and Spain. In 1953, the show made its first appearance in North Africa (Algier and Oran). Adolf Eder was the commercial director. In the middle of the 1950s, the Vienna Ice Revue was one of the first “Western” institutions to appear in Moscow, Kiev and Leningrad following World War II. In Berlin, Antwerp and Moscow, the program was shown annually about 50 times in each city with an audience of about 10,000 people watching each performance. Later, the Vienna Ice Revue also toured Israel and the United States.\n\nMany world-famous figure skaters from Austria starred in the Vienna Ice Revue such as Olympic runner-up Eva Pawlik (as a single skater and together with Rudi Seeliger as a couple), Olympic runner-up Helmut Seibt, European-, World- and Olympic Champions Sissy Schwarz and Kurt Oppelt, Olympic bronze medalist Ingrid Wendl, World runner-up Champion Hanna Eigel, Olympic runner-up Regine Heitzer and World Champion Emmerich Danzer. World-class figure skaters from Germany that starred in the Vienna Ice Revue were World Champions Marika Kilius and Hans-Jürgen Bäumler and Olympic Champion Manfred Schnelldorfer.\n\nFrom the fall of 1958 to the spring of 1960, the Vienna Ice Revue presented three World runner-up champions and European champions from Austria in one show: \"Eva Pawlik\", Hanna Eigel and \"Ingrid Wendl\", who made her debut as a professional skater in 1958.\n\nSpring on Ice \"(\"Frühling auf dem Eis\")\", produced in 1950, was the first movie presenting the Vienna Ice Revue. Eva Pawlik played the main role on the ice and in the frame story together with Austrian actors Hans Holt, Harry Fuß, Oskar Sima, Heinz Conrads and Albin Skoda. Further figure-skating stars presented in this movie: Emmy Puzinger, Hellmut May, Rudi Seeliger, Erni Zlam, Edith Petter and ice clown Bertl Capek.\n\nSymphony in Gold (\"\"Symphonie in Gold\"), produced in 1956, presented the European bronze medalist Emmy Puzinger together with Fernand Leemans from Belgium and Jiřína Nekolová from Czechoslovakia who had finished fourth at the 1948 Olympics.\n\nThe movie Revue of Dreams (\"Traumrevue\"), produced in 1959, is a historical figure-skating document showing three European champions on the ice, with two of them performing in the frame story. Eva Pawlik played the role of a fictitious Hungarian figure-skating star. Besides, she was actress Waltraut Haas´ double on the ice. Ingrid Wendl was the second ice star who also played a role in the frame-story. The third European Champion of the Vienna Ice Revue ensemble presented in this movie was Hanna Eigel. Further figure-skating stars presented in this movie: Emmy Puzinger, Fernand Leemans, Rudi Seeliger, Inge and Willi Schilling, Charlotte Michiels and the ice clowns Herbert Bobek and Pieter van Gils.\n\nIn the movies \"Kauf dir einen bunten Luftballon\", produced in 1960, and A Star Is Falling From The Sky (\"Ein Stern fällt vom Himmel\"), produced in 1961, German Champion Ina Bauer played the main role on the ice and in the frame story together with Austrian thrice Olympic skiing Champion Toni Sailer.\n\nIn the movies The Great Free Programme (\"Die große Kür\"), produced in 1964, and The Great Happiness (\"Das große Glück\"\"), produced in 1967, twice World Champions and Olympic runners-up Marika Kilius and Hans-Jürgen Bäumler were the main stars on the ice and in the frame story. Further figure-skating stars presented in these movies: Emmy Puzinger and Fernand Leemans, Ingrid Wendl, Helmut Löfke and Norbert Felsinger.\n\nIn 1971, the Vienna Ice Revue slid into a dangerous financial crisis. Morris Chalfen, the boss of Holiday On Ice, bought the enterprise.
