{"id": "154156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154156", "title": "Cloak", "text": "Cloak\n\nA cloak is a type of loose garment that is worn over indoor clothing and serves the same purpose as an overcoat; it protects the wearer from the cold, rain or wind for example, or it may form part of a fashionable outfit or uniform. Cloaks have been used by myriad historic societies; many climates favor wearing a full-body garment which is easily removed and does not constrain the wearer with sleeves. Over time cloak designs have been changed to match fashion and available textiles.\n\nCloaks generally fasten at the neck or over the shoulder, vary in length, from hip all the way down to the ankle, mid-calf being the normal length. They may have an attached hood and may cover and fasten down the front, in which case they have holes or slits for the hands to pass through. However, cloaks are almost always sleeveless.\n\nThe word \"cloak\" comes from Old North French \"cloque\" (Old French \"cloche\", \"cloke\") meaning \"travelling cloak\", from Medieval Latin \"clocca\" \"travelers' cape,\" literally \"a bell,\" so called from the garment's bell-like shape. Thus the word is related to the word \"clock\".\n\nAncient Greeks and Romans were known to wear cloaks. Greek men and women wore the \"himation\", from the Archaic through the Hellenistic periods (c. 750-30 BC). Romans would later wear the Greek-styled cloak, the \"pallium\". The \"pallium\" was quadrangular, shaped like a square, and sat on the shoulders, not unlike the \"himation\".\n\nRomans of the Republic would wear the toga as a formal display of their citizenship. It was denied to foreigners and was worn by magistrates on all occasions as a badge of office. The toga was claimed to have originated with Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome.\n\nIn full evening dress in the Western countries, ladies and gentlemen frequently use the cloak as a fashion statement, or to protect the fine fabrics of evening wear from the elements, especially where a coat would crush or hide the garment. Opera cloaks are made of quality materials such as wool or cashmere, velvet and satin.\n\nLadies may wear a long (over the shoulders or to ankles) cloak usually called a cape, or a full-length cloak. Gentlemen wear an ankle-length or full-length cloak. Formal cloaks often have expensive, colored linings and trimmings such as silk, satin, velvet and fur.\n\nAccording to the King James Version of the Bible, Matthew recorded Jesus of Galilee saying in Matthew 5:40: \"And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.\" The King James Version of the Bible has the words recorded a little differently in Luke 6:29: \"...and him that taketh away thy cloke, forbid not to take thy coat also.\"\n\nCloaks are a staple garment in the fantasy genre due to the popularity of medieval settings, although fantasy cloak designs normally have more resemblance to 18th or 19th-century cloaks rather than medieval ones. They are also usually associated with witches, wizards, and vampires; the best-known stage version of \"Dracula,\" which first made actor Bela Lugosi prominent, featured him wearing it so that his exit through a trap door concealed on the stage could seem sudden. When Lugosi reprised his role as Dracula for the 1931 Universal Studios motion picture version of the play, he retained the cloak as part of his outfit, which made such a strong impression that cloaks came to be equated with Count Dracula in nearly all non-historical media depictions of him.\n\nFantasy cloaks are often magical. For example, they may grant the person wearing it invisibility as in the \"Harry Potter\" series by J. K. Rowling. A similar sort of garment is worn by the members of the Fellowship of the Ring in \"The Lord of the Rings\" by J. R. R. Tolkien, although instead of granting complete invisibility, the Elf-made cloaks simply appear to shift between any natural color (e.g. green, gray, brown) to help the wearer to blend in with his or her surroundings. Alternatively, they may nullify magical projectiles, as the \"cloak of magic resistance\" in NetHack. In addition, the magical hide armor that Hercules made for himself from the skin of the Nemean Lion, at the end of Hercules' first labor, might also be seen as an early idea of a magical cloak. This latter was notable because it was said to be impervious to \"all\" cutting and impact weapons.\n\nFiguratively, a cloak may be anything that disguises or conceals something. In many science fiction worlds such as \"Star Trek\", there are cloaking devices, which provide a way to avoid detection or to make objects appear invisible.\n\nBecause they keep a person hidden and conceal a weapon, the phrase \"cloak and dagger\" has come to refer to espionage and secretive crimes: it suggests murder from hidden sources. \"Cloak and dagger\" stories are thus mystery, detective, and crime stories of this. The vigilante duo of Marvel comics Cloak and Dagger is a reference to this.\n\n\n"}

Important archaeological ruins, gold and silver ornaments, stone monuments, ceramics, and weavings remain from several important pre-Columbian cultures. Major ruins include Tiwanaku, Samaipata, Inkallaqta and Iskanwaya. The country abounds in other sites that are difficult to reach and hardly explored by archaeologists.\n\nThe Spanish brought their own tradition of religious art which, in the hands of local indigenous and \"mestizo\" builders and artisans, developed into a rich and distinctive style of architecture, literature, and sculpture known as \"Mestizo Baroque.\" The colonial period produced not only the paintings of Perez de Holguin, Flores, Bitti, and others, but also the works of skilled but unknown stonecutters, woodcarvers, goldsmiths, and silversmiths. An important body of native baroque religious music of the colonial period was recovered in recent years and has been performed internationally to wide acclaim since 1994. Bolivian artists of stature in the 20th century include, among others, Guzman de Rojas, Arturo Borda, María Luisa Pacheco, Master William Vega, Alfredo Da Silva, and Marina Núñez del Prado.\n\nPagan rites from the pre-Columbian era are still common during the religious festivals of the Natives. The clothing used during the festivals is reminiscent of the dress of pre-Columbian Indians and 16th century Spaniards. The at the annual carnival of Oruro are among the great folkloric events of South America, as are the lesser known indigenous \"Anata Andina\" and the \"carnival\" at Tarabuco (\"Pujllay\"), or the \"Tinku\" - fertility rites held at Macha every 3 May.\n\nMany dances and songs contain elements from both the native and European cultures. \"Caporales\" seems to be the most popular Bolivian dance of present times – in a few decades it has developed into an enormously popular dance, not only in the Highlands where it originated, but also in the Lowlands and in Bolivian communities outside the country. In the Highlands, other traditional and still very popular dances are: \nIn the Lowlands, there are:\n\nClothing of Andean women of indigenous descent includes the pollera (pleated-skirt), the 19th century European bowler hat, and a silky shawl known as a manta. The pollera was originally a simple Spanish dress that colonial authorities forced Spanish people to wear. The pollera is a symbol of pride for the indigenous people, who live in La Paz, and for people in rural areas.\nThe inhabitants of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, from babies to seniors, wear the same kind of clothes that are typical in western countries, like jeans, shorts (which are the most common because of the heat), t-shirts, dresses, etc.\n\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Bolivia. The governing body of football in Bolivia is the Federación Boliviana de Fútbol (FBF), which controls the national teams. The FBF organises the men's, women's, and futsal national teams.\n\nThe Bolivia national football team is currently ranked 69th in the world, with their best FIFA ranking being 18th in the world. The national team has competed at the FIFA World Cup three times, the Copa América 23 times, and the Confederations Cup once.\n\nLa Paz has the highest tournament-class golf course in the world.\n\nBolivia's national basketball team finished 8th at the 2016 South American Basketball Championship. There, Bolivia beat Ecuador 75-74 for its first victory ever at the event. Bolivia's women's national basketball team won the silver medal at the 1978 South American Basketball Championship for Women.\n\nBolivian cuisine stems mainly from the combination of Spanish cuisine with traditional native Bolivian ingredients, with later influences from Germans, Italians, Basques, Croats, Russians, and Poles, due to the arrival of immigrants from those countries. The three traditional staples of Bolivian cuisine are corn, potatoes, and beans. These ingredients have been combined with a number of staples brought by the Europeans, such as rice, wheat, and meat, such as beef, pork, and chicken.\n\nBolivia's regional folk music is distinctive and varied. In the Andean regions, music is played during the festivals and dances. Some tunes contain strong Spanish influences.\n\nThe most common musical instruments are:\n\n\n"}

Prototypicality relates to threat perception in that the more prototypical an individual looks, specifically focusing on blacks, the more others who associate blacks with they stereotype of dangerousness will perceive them as threatening. Prototypic black targets display physical traits stereotypically associated with Blacks (broad nose, large lips, coarse hair, darker skin tone). Prototypicality affected prejudice; it was shown to impact judgments about an individual's characteristics. For example, a study by Ma & Corell (2011) showed that individuals are more biased and prejudiced against more prototypic black targets than less prototypic targets.\n\nIn daily life, individuals are more likely to encounter white people as the default race within the United States as opposed to Black individuals. When encountering atypical whites (white people with features associated with Blackness), individuals ultimately settle on a White response (the general response to typical white targets is to decide not to shoot quicker and more frequently than in trials with black targets), in contrast to encountering Blacks with atypical features where Black cues appear to be more dominant and elicit a Black (to decide to shoot quicker and more frequently than trials with white targets) due to a misplaced threat perception. Lay people are more racially biased, on average, than trained individuals such as police officers. Prototypicality is shown to moderate racial bias which has been shown to be linked to a perceived threat as black people specifically are predisposed to being viewed as more threatening. Police officers show a reduced racial bias in comparison to members of the community; however, police officers were no better than community members in their sensitivity to prototypic targets providing evidence that prototypicality is directly linked to stereotypes and threat perception which ultimately perpetuates stereotype threat. Members of the same category (race) become harder to distinguish from other members of the same category the more they look like a prototypical representation of their category. (Young, Hugenberg, Bernstein, Sacco 2009).\n\nRacial ambiguity is linked to prototypicality in that racially ambiguous individuals walk a line of not always looking prototypical of either group they represent, but being a blend of the various groups. This can leave blurred lines in terms of threat perception in having difficulty categorizing a racially ambiguous individual and determining what perception is more accurate: a more threatening perception in line with black stereotypes or a less threatening perception akin to white stereotypes. (Young, Hugenberg, Bernstein, & Sacco 2009). Racially ambiguous faces get more racial bias than white faces and less racial bias than black faces, acting as an intermediate, on average. There is evidence for the implicit associations of slight differences in facial features. The degree to which racially ambiguous faces appeared most in line with the prototypical representation of a race, either black or white, directly activated and impacted the evaluations of participants associated with the respective group. This then bolstered stereotypes and the predisposition of individuals to be judges and evaluated based on stereotypes. This also has potential to breed stereotype threat into a marginalized population. In a white-only context, racially ambiguous individuals are viewed as more prototypically Black, and thus more threatening, whereas in a Black-only context, racially ambiguous individuals are viewed as less prototypically black. Facial features matter when associating a racially ambiguous individual with an evaluative association of a respective group.\n\nPerceptions of threat based on stereotypes associated with one’s physicality can certainly promote stereotype threat, as a person’s physicality that often associates them with a race-based stereotype is not easily changed. Hypodescent is a phenomenon that is present in a racially ambiguous individuals being categorized into the racial group associated with their more “socially-subordinate heritage.” This concept is a demonstration of a way in which the categorization of racially ambiguous individuals can influence the longevity of a stereotype by supporting a subordinate heritage of any individual based on race. However more difficult to categorize individuals who tend to look more similar to the prototypical representation of their dominant race (for example: 90-10 Black:White) than it is to distinguish a more racially ambiguous individual (60-40 Black:White) which is very ironic in that one might think the more prototypical you look, the easier it would be to assign you to a racial category to assess your perceived threat. Perceptions of racially ambiguous faces can be impacted by racial labeling and the context in which the faces are presented (white-only vs. black-only environment). (Ito, Willadsen-Jensen, Kaye, & Park 2011).\n\nCategorization of individuals as a tool for evaluating them reduces an individual to being associated with the streotypical representation of that group. Once stereotypical associations are made, this gives rise to individuals assessing the level of threat an individual exhibits if a threatening connotation is associated with the stereotype of that group. Research suggests that things are identified by comparing its traits to an association of similar items/processes stored in their memory. When categorizing and making connections of an individual to a stereotype equating their perception of threat to the degree to which that categorized individual aligns with the stereotype can lead to stereotype threat falling on the categorized person. Lasting effects of race category activation on judgment, evaluation, and behavior that can have serious outcomes, such as biases in criminal sentences. Individuals vary in the extent to which stereotypes are associated with social categories. Strength of stereotype association impacts stereotype effect. Categorization was thought to be inevitable, a result of the perception of others...however it is avoidable and its avoidance can hopefully reduce prejudice, reduce unjust threat perceptions, and counteract stereotype threat.\n\nA stereotype can be defined as the association of a group with a trait (ex: Blacks being linked to dangerousness or criminality). In the United States individuals are more likely to encounter white people as the default race as opposed to Black individuals. In a White majority, perceptual systems may be more sensitive to, and also more biased toward Black features which can automatically activate stereotypes that link to threat perception. Event Related Potentials (ERPs) demonstrate attention is preferentially directed toward Black targets showing that there is a tendency to attend to potential threats, which black individuals have been stereotypically associated with. Descriptions of stereotypical Black behavior are more likely to be attributed to photographs of individuals who appear to be more Afrocentric.\n\nThe Quadruple Process Model involves a stimulus (ex: Black male) activating an association (ex: threat) in which the strength of the association (stereotype) prompts a behavior (ex: shoot response). To survive, evolutionarily, humans must be to reliably identify threats. The stimulus, association, stereotype, behavior system prompts the identification of a threat and initiates a response to the stimulus. Threat relevant associates are emotionally saturate and essential for survival. Not only can threat perception be influenced by emotionally salient factors, cultural stereotypes, and their strength combine to disadvantage blacks to be perceived as more threatening. Recent stereotypes suggest that Blacks, even when unarmed, may be perceived as threatening. Shooter bias is a tendency to shoot armed Blacks quicker and more frequently than armed Whites, but deciding not to shoot unarmed Whites quicker and more frequently than unarmed Blacks. Individuals with greater knowledge of this cultural stereotype or a predisposition to link Blacks to violence displayed more extreme shooter bias and especially biased threat perceptions that led to especially biased behavior.\n\nThere are two race effects that lead to Blacks being incorrectly shot at more than Whites:\nAfter being tasked to shoot individuals who held guns, and not to shoot if they were carrying any other object, race should technically be irrelevant to the decision to shoot or not shoot because the correct response solely depends on the object being held. Even as a nondiagnostic component to the evaluation of one’s perceived threat value race was still factored in to the overall judgment of threat perception. The only information the participants were obligated to attend to was the identification of a weapon or non-weapon. Racial cues promote biased behavior as well as false threat perception. Any cue that implies danger, not just race, may create a predisposition to shoot, however race and the stereotype associated with it lead to a higher evaluation of threat perception, which impacted biased responses.\n\nStereotypes have the potential to create associations with positive or negative aspects of the group it is generalizing. Research shows there is general negativity/prejudice toward Blacks leading highly prejudice individuals to link Blacks to negativity that is or is not relevant to the Black stereotype (ex: linking Blacks to words like poison or cancer). Black danger association and stereotypes predict that Black faces capture and hold attention faster and longer than white faces because threatening stimuli captures and holds attention faster and for longer intervals than neutral stimuli (in this case black faces). The perception of the level of threat posed by a black face significantly biases attention allocation due to an unjust stereotype leading to inaccurate threat perceptions. This also suggests that as fear conditioned stimuli, individuals are taught to have a pre-established instinct to associate the threat perception of a black individual as more dangerous. Attention has been shown to be biased as a result of societal stereotypes of Blacks in association with danger stereotypes of Blacks in association with danger that leads Black faces to b seen as fear conditioned stimuli. Stereotypes can be gate keepers, they can be self-perpetuating by directing attention towards expected information or as an efficient information processing device that directs attention towards new information that may potentially undermine the stereotype and is dependent upon the individuals use of the stereotype. The individual use of the stereotype is also what unfairly moderates the perceived threat of blacks by way of conditioning longstanding stereotypes.\n\nWith the increasing strength of a stereotype, cognitively the associations we have attached to that stereotype, such as a higher rated threat perception of blacks, will be analyzed with more ease. Because people are motivated to use as little cognitive resources as possible stereotypes and the connotations attached to them, such as threat perceptions of blacks, last as the most readily available and most easily comprehensible explanation. In a White majority, the perceptual system may be more sensitive to Black faces, and more biased as well. ERPs demonstrate that attention is preferentially directed toward black targets. Participants were more biased/prejudice against prototypic Black targets that less prototypic black targets shown through fMRI and being presented with more or less prototypic individuals. Non-prototypic individuals (ex: dark skinned white males) caused greater amygdala activation (akin to fear response) than did light skinned white males. The amygdala is associated with fear, threat and emotion processing.\n\nStereotypes and other expectations act as filters that increase the ease with which expectancy-consistent information can be processed. People are motivated to use as little cognitive resources as possible giving the most attention to the easiest comprehensible material (expectancy-consistent information). As stereotype strength increases, so should the ease of processing stereotype-consistent information. Attention will shift from stereotype-consistent information to stereotype-inconsistent information. Unexpected information is processed more extensively because it is more difficult to comprehend while consistent information can be coded as generic examples of the expectancy but inconsistent information must be uniquely coded as new information that is not aligned with expectancy.\n\nThe environment or context through which information is received impacts the threat associated with it. For example, if a man is wearing a hoodie and walking rather fast towards you in the morning, in a rich neighborhood, on a crowded street, while it is raining, threat perception is lower than encountering that same individual after dark, in a poverty stricken neighborhood with no rain on an empty street. Although this could have no threatening intentions at all, the context in which you encounter that person will dictate the level of threat associated with them. Ecological contamination hypothesis states: environment taints perceptions. Those who are in dangerous neighborhood seem more dangerous (ex: police use more force in poverty stricken neighborhoods that have high crime rates and greater proportions of minorities). When the background appeared to be safe, racial bias was present (armed Blacks were shot quicker and more frequently than armed whites), vs. when the background was threatening, racial bias was reduced (demonstrated by a tendency to increase the rate at which White targets were shot increasing). Blacks were still treated hostile in dangerous and non dangerous contexts. Dangerous contexts proved to reduce racial bias in the decision to shoot in that Whites were treated in a similar, hostile fashion to Blacks, not that Blacks were treated with similar regard or restraint as Whites. There is an increasing racial bias from white people, racially ambiguous individuals, and Black faces. Racially ambiguous faces get more racial bias than white faces and less racial bias than black faces, acting as an intermediate, on average. In a white-only context, racially ambiguous individuals are viewed as more prototypically Black, whereas in a Black-only context, racially ambiguous individuals are viewed as less prototypically black. Perceptions of racially ambiguous faces can be impacted by direct-racial labeling and the context in which the faces are presented (White only vs Black only environments). Mixed contexts lead to a more mild bias than segregated situation.\n\nSignal detection theory (SDT) involves a bias and reduces ability to distinguish tools from weapons after a Black prime even in situations when race was incidental (nondiagnostic). The only cue the participants were obligated to attend to was the presence of a weapon or non-weapon. However, unable to sever blacks from their stereotype and its related factors, unjust heightened threat perception persists.\n\nThe bias toward threat perception evaluation of black people, caused by stereotypes, can be lessened with access to diagnostic cues (ex: presence or absence of a weapon) and motivation. Lay people are more racially biased, on average, than trained police officers. Target prototypicality is shown to moderate racial bias. Police officers show a reduced racial bias in comparison to members of the community, however police officers were no better than community members in their sensitivity to prototypic targets. Exposing people to stimuli where race is unrelated to the stereotype may eliminate racial bias. Initial responses were racially biased but research shows that extensive practice with race being unrelated to the task at hand worked to eliminate racial bias. As counter-stereotypical information is aggregated form multiple sources, it may force a change in the stereotype decreasing its strength or negating it entirely. Exposure to counter stereotypic stimuli can reduce racial bias, making race non-diagnostic and unhelpful for the decision process; the characteristic (violence) is unrelated to the group (race). Critical characteristics (weapon possession) is statistically unrelated to race therefore paying attention to race may hinder your judgment because it is non-diagnostic (unessential) to the task at hand. It may be beneficial to expose individuals to counter stereotypic information and stereotypic stimuli to change the nature of category-based responses. Racial bias appeared to be significantly reduced (for the parameters of the study) with training indicating that change can be made. A stereotype can be a gatekeeper, perpetuating itself by directing attention toward expected information, or as an efficient information-processing device that facilitates the extraction of novel information with the potential to undermine itself.\n\n"}

It is also used to impose conformity to perceived racial, national, gender or societal norms.\n\nThe principle can directly affect hiring and retention decisions. In the world of television news, there is a bias to hire those who have shared values and biases with the organization. Likewise, executive producers of news shows tend to hire staff that share their ideology and viewpoint, to the extent that FIFO is ruthlessly applied.\n\nWriter Kevin Duncan, in his book titled \"The Business Bullshit Book: The world’s most comprehensive dictionary\", suggests it is a \"no-holds barred\", \"frank\" and open assessment by a supervisor, who maps the employee's chances and alternate career paths boldly, forthrightly and unhesitatingly. This is said to be \"not necessarily\" to the employee's advantage.\n\nFitting in is not “a one way ticket.” \"The Guardian\" newspaper quoted an anonymous source, who was employed by a United Kingdom housing association, said that FIFO is a rule of organizational life. It is an organizational paradigm whereby the members of the team adopt ‘protective coloration’ and undergo a change in their behavior and beliefs. It is a strong deterrent to whistle blowing, for example.\n\nCorporate implementation of a FIFO policy was said to be coincidental, if not causally-related, to a toxic tit-for-tat relationship with a union. As The Tyee opines:\"One of the few things that the union and management agree on is that there is a new culture at Telus. Management describes it as the culture of a competitive meritocracy. Some people in the union at Telus call it the 'FIFO war.'<br>\n\"The term comes from Telus CEO Darren Entwistle, the Montreal-born executive who came to Telus five years ago from a telecommunications company in the U.K. In a profile of Entwistle that ran in \"B.C. Business\" magazine in May, Lori Bamber wrote this about FIFO:<br>\n\"'In accounting it stands for ‘first in, first out’; at Telus, after Entwistle's arrival, it stood for ‘fit in or fuck off.’ It wasn't something that endeared him to people who heard about it. ‘You could get away with more in Europe,’ he says when asked about this controversial human resources philosophy. ‘People expect you to tell it like it is there.’”\n\nIn the United Kingdom there were government proposals to statutorily extend Employment-at-will and permit employers to have immunity for \"Fit in or fuck off\" (not in those words) discussions with employees. Such proposals have met with vocal opposition by organized labor, specifically Unite the Union.\n\nThe acronym \"FIFO\", the neologism, the phrase and meme \"fit in or fuck off\", and the concept have been expanded and exported to other contexts. For example it is used as a justification for racism, nationalism (\"e.g.\", jingoism), ethnic, nativist, immigrant restriction and xenophobic reaction, regulation and action. It is a direction in the United States to assimilate and be productive.\n\nSexist reactions and stereotypes are also justified under the rubric. Thus, female guests on podcasts of \"This American Life\" have been often criticized for 'non-Alpha' speech patterns, even though prominent males (\"e.g.\", Noam Chomsky) have exhibited similar traits. Some have advised these women to \"FIFO\". \n\nIt has become a contentious anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant slogan in Canada.\n\n"}

While this may suggest a longer play, some scenes are quite scant. For instance, act three, scene seven contains just two sentences of dialogue from a single character. The play as published by \"Internet Shakespeare Editions\" runs approximately 545 lines. It contains minimal stage direction, restricting itself to character entrances, musical descriptions, and descriptors of physical action. The plot runs largely along the lines of the familiar Shakespearean \"Hamlet,\" but it differs on occasion both in its events and the order of those events, and is notable for its elements of comedic farce, which have been emphasized in various productions.\n\nThe play begins with an induction, wherein Night, personified as a wicked, trickster-like figure, calls forth three \"furies\", Alecto, Mägera, and Thisiphone, to assist her. She informs them that the new King of the land yearns for his sister-in-law and has murdered his brother—the previous king—so that he might have her. Night wishes to cloud both their judgements to aid in their incestuous relationship but also to sow discord and jealousy into their marriage. She also intends to raise up a desire for revenge in those loyal to the slain king. Alecto, Mägera, and Thisiphone agree to assist her. The play ends with an admonishment to those who would seek power through foul play to reconsider, as they will likely be repaid by similar means.\n\nThe remainder of \"Fratricide Punished\" seems at once familiar to readers of \"Hamlet\", yet at times strange. There are some important differences in the naming of characters. Perhaps the most noteworthy of these is Corambus, a name familiar in Q1 \"Hamlet\" but changed to Polonius in Q2 and the folio editions of Shakespeare's text. Corambus' son, Leonhard, is similarly named Laertes in those texts. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are noticeably absent, their roles replaced in part by unnamed Ruffians. The text also creates the character of Phantasmo to undertake a variety of roles, often comically.\n\nOther notable differences include the lack of Hamlet's \"to be or not to be\" soliloquy, among others, and Ophelia's decision to commit suicide by jumping down a hill. One of the more \"slapstick\" differences comes when the Prince has been sent to England, accompanied by his would-be assassins. He foils their attempt on his life by having them stand on either side of him. At the moment the assassins shoot, Hamlet falls to the ground with the result that they shoot one another instead of him.\n\nSimilarities and differences between \"Fratricide Punished\", Q1 \"Hamlet\", and the second quarto and folio editions of \"Hamlet\" are a powerful point of discussion in academic discussions.\n\nSurprisingly little is known about the history of \"Fratricide Punished\" prior to its publication, and there is little academic consensus about its early origins. The German editor H.A.O. Reichard, who first published excerpts from the manuscript in his \"Theater-Kalender auf das Jahr 1779\" and went on to publish the work in its entirety in 1781 in his journal \"Olla Potrida,\" confirms only that the original bore the text \"Pretz, den 27. Oktober 1710\" (Pretz, October 27, 1710). Later, Nino Amico, referencing work by University of Catania professor Ingrid Hiller, claimed that the manuscript of \"Fratricide Punished\" was of a small format and some thirteen pages. Hiller's research, however, appears not to have been published and others have been unable to corroborate this elsewhere, such that even these scant details remain unconfirmable.\n\nWhile the date of October 27, 1710 clearly places the manuscript in time, if not necessarily the time it was written, the location of Pretz remains disputed. It is known from the original publication by Reichard that he obtained the manuscript of \"Fratricide Punished\" from Konrad Ekhof, a theater manager and historian, who had recently died. Ekhof's father-in-law had started a theater company in the town of Preetz, a location in Plön, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, in 1710. This has led Oxford professor Tiffany Stern to assert that the \"Pretz\" annotation on the manuscript most likely refers to Preetz, intuiting that Ekhof must have received the text from his father-in-law. Amico, however, places the text at Kloster Preetz, a nunnery. Still others have argued that \"Pretz\" refers to either the towns of Graz, Austria or Pretzsch, Germany. Whatever answers the manuscript might have provided to these questions were lost when the manuscript itself was lost, at least as early as 1888.\n\nWith regard to the date of its writing, many scholars believe \"Fratricide Punished\" to be a manuscript developed over years of English performances in Germany beginning as early as 1586. Kareen Klein, building off a sizable scholarly tradition, traces the lineage from the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, where troupes of English comedians, forced abroad by closed theaters at home, began touring continental Europe. They brought with them an expanded understanding of acting that included such fields as pantomime, dance, and clowning. Such physical skills were uncommon for continental actors of the time and would be necessary for performers looking to convey the meaning of their English-language scripts to audiences who spoke only German. That language barrier would, in time, cause the scripts of staples such as \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Titus Andronicus\", and perhaps \"Hamlet\", to be modified into simpler, more physical forms. Over time, as English troupes came to augment their numbers with German actors, their scripts would be translated into German editions.\n\nReflecting the importance of Q1 Hamlet on the perceived relevance of \"Fratricide Punished,\" the text was first translated into English by Georgina Archer, not for the sake of the play itself but rather for Albert Cohn's 1865 book \"Shakespeare in Germany.\" R.G. Latham provided another translation in 1872. Claiming that Archer's translation attempted to too heavily mimic the style of Shakespeare, and citing minor differences with Latham, Furness supplied a new translation in his 1877 \"Variorum\" collection. More recently, Christine Schmidle produced a translation for her 2010 theatrical production of the play, an experience that led her to believe that much of the comical effect of the work was a result of language barriers and adaptation experienced and undertaken by English actors performing in German-speaking lands.\n\nWhile scholars generally agree that \"Fratricide Punished\" is a memorial reconstruction descended from some form of \"Hamlet\", it remains uncertain from which \"Hamlet\" it comes. The differences and similarities between \"Fratricide Punished\" and the three major forms of \"Hamlet\" were examined line-by-line by George Duthie in his 1941 criticism of the so-called \"bad quarto\" of Q1, and the \"Variorum\" of Furness published the texts side-by-side as well. Their analyses found a play that contained elements both of Q1 \"Hamlet\", published in 1603 but unknown until 1823, and the more familiar versions of the second quarto (1604) and folio (1623), as well as elements uniquely its own. This is a remarkably problematic finding for Shakespeare scholars, complicating an area already made difficult by the discovery of Q1. Indeed, the majority of what has been written about \"Fratricide Punished\" exists strictly to better understand its relation to Q1 \"Hamlet\", such that it becomes troublesome to discuss one without the other.\n\nYet, as it contains elements of all three versions, it seems clear that \"Fratricide Punished\" must have been reconstructed by an actor with knowledge of more than one version of \"Hamlet\". Kathleen Irace, in presenting this, argues that the use of the name Corambus instead of Polonius firmly ties \"Fratricide Punished\" to Q1, as does the \"increased villainy\" of the King, who alone is responsible for devising the poisoning plot. Yet, some elements exclusive to Q2 and F1 are found in the text as well. Irace points out that the first portion of the King's speech in Act I, Scene II is missing from Q1 \"Hamlet\" but oddly present in \"Fratricide Punished.\" Meanwhile, elements exclusive to the text or shared only with Q1 would seem to some scholars to link \"Fratricide Punished\" to the \"Ur-Hamlet,\" a kind of primordial source text which some scholars have suggested was used by Shakespeare in creating his \"Hamlet\". The existence of the \"Ur-Hamlet\" is debated in itself. Lastly, Duthie argues that the long gap between the assumed time of the text's creation and its discovery is wholly unaccounted for, leaving room for any number of changes.\n\nZachary Lesser, discussing the impact of Q1 \"Hamlet\" on the popular reception of Q2 and F1, demonstrates the way that both Q1 and \"Fratricide Punished\" have been used to support arguments from multiple camps across decades of time, a testament to the ongoing significance of the work.\n\nThough it may have been born from production, few productions of \"Fratricide Punished\" have been undertaken since its discovery. In 1924, William Poel, a British actor and theater manager who had staged a production of Q1 Hamlet in 1881, mounted a production of the play in Oxford, England at the New Oxford Theatre. His promptbook, later published, contends that the audience met the characters with a derision and laughter far removed from the typical experience of \"Hamlet\" audiences. Joe Falocco argues that, by choosing to perform both Q1 and \"Fratricide Punished,\" Poel was demonstrating a willingness to disregard the importance of Shakespeare's authorship in the text, in accordance with earlier understandings of authorship, a constant facet of \"Hamlet\" discussions.\n\nThis is not to say that \"Fratricide Punished\" is without influence on theatrical productions. Both Q1 Hamlet and \"Fratricide Punished\" place their scenes in a different order than do the Q2 and folio versions of \"Hamlet\", and this may have inspired stage directors to reorder their own productions of \"Hamlet\" in turn.\n\nA version of \"Fratricide Punished\" was performed at the NADA theater in New York City for the \"Hamlet\" Festival of 1994 alongside a rap version of \"Hamlet\" entitled \"The Trage-D of Prince Hammy T.\" The play was directed by Randolph Curtis Rand. According to one reviewer, Rand chose to abandon more staid stage interpretations of \"Hamlet\" in order to highlight the comical elements of \"Fratricide Punished\". Toward that end, Hamlet himself was portrayed wearing a loud tuxedo costume reminiscent of John Travolta's character in \"Saturday Night Fever,\" while the characters of the induction were portrayed as though members of The Addams Family.\n\nIn 1981, Nino Amico suggested that \"Fratricide Punished\" was a play adapted for performance by puppets, sparking mild academic debate as well as the imagination of theater producers. The Hidden Room Theatre company, following up on the extensive research done by Tiffany Stern on Amico's claims, produced a puppet version that included live musical accompaniment and pyrotechnics. The initial production was performed in Staunton, Virginia at the American Shakespeare Center's reproduction of the Blackfriars Theater and went on for a full run in Austin, Texas. The company also performed \"Fratricide Punished\" at Shakespeare's Globe Theater, University College, Oxford, and the Shakespeare Institute, as well as at Villanova University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a talk from noted Shakespeare scholar Zachary Lesser of the University of Pennsylvania, and at other universities. It used a translation provided by Christine Schmidle, who had previously performed a German-language version of \"Fratricide Punished\" at the Center in 2010.\n\nThe Hidden Room Theatre won multiple awards for their performance, which was renewed for the 2016 season. Despite this success, the central premise of the performance remains unconvincing to some. June Schlueter, responding to Tiffany Stern's article, saw no basis for the assumption that \"Fratricide Punished\" was a play designed for puppets. Instead, she claims that the elements which lend themselves to puppets, such as the plays slapstick humor and physicality, are the result of actors adapting the work to make it more accessible beyond language barriers—a theme that Christine Schmidle also explored in her German language production of the play.\n\n\"Fratricide Punished\" was performed in German at the American Shakespeare Center in 2010. The performance was conceived by Christine Schmidle, who would go on to translate the play for the 2015 puppet show there. Schmidle, like many scholars, believed the work to be the result of English comedic actors touring continental Europe in the late 1500s. By performing the play in German to an English speaking audience, she hoped to replicate (albeit in reverse) the kind of problems that those actors would have experienced in conveying meaning across language barriers. In an essay published by the \"Shakespeare Bulletin\", Schmidle described the kinds of abridgments and added physicality that her troupe undertook in creating a play that would be accessible to the audience. Ultimately, she decided that \"Fratricide Punished\" represented a kind of road map to the play's origins, and that her performance clearly demonstrated that the differences existing between \"Hamlet\" and the text were made entirely in order to better convey meaning.\n"}

Created by Chris Claremont and Sal Buscema, she first appeared in \"Ms. Marvel\" 11 (1977).\n\nHecate is among the Titans who ruled the ancient world that Zeus spares when he deposes them and conquers Olympus, and becomes Olympus' resident Goddess of Magic. She is the first deity to give magic to mortals, in defiance of Zeus who had forbidden the gods from meddling with humans. Zeus later exiles her from Olympus, wiping her memories and stripping her of her powers.\n\nHecate appears on Earth, claiming to be an extra-dimensional explorer, mistaken for Hecate on a visit to the planet some millenia prior. At one point she fights Ms. Marvel.\n\nAt some point, she loses more of her memories and becomes an inmate of the Raft. During the \"Fear Itself\" storyline, Hecate is among the Raft inmates who escape after Juggernaut in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone levels it. She assists Basilisk, Griffin, and Man-Bull in a bank robbery until Hercules arrives and recognizes her. Hecate shortly regains her memories, recovers her godly abilities, and decides to take over Brooklyn, reshaping the borough to resemble a monster-infested Ancient Greece. Hercules kills her ally Kyknos and she flees as Brooklyn returns to its normal state.\n\nSome time later, the Scarlet Witch seeks out Hecate after sensing a disturbance in witchcraft. She finds her operating a café on a Greek island and asks for her help. Hecate explains that she is content to remain uninvolved with the world of witchcraft, but mentions that there is a magical disturbance on the island, which could support Wanda's theory that magic is broken. She asks Wanda to defeat a Minotaur that has been murdering islanders, and the heroine discovers that the Emerald Warlock, a century-old mage, had forcibly transformed Man-Bull to do his bidding.\n\nDuring her exile, Hecate was solely capable of shapeshifting, projecting energy bolts, and bringing images from others' minds to life.\n\nWhen her memories returned, Hecate regained her Olympian characteristics, which includes superhuman strength (lifting 25 tons), durability, speed, and endurance. She is also immortal and unaging, immune to all human ailments and diseases. As the Olympian goddess of magic, Hecate is an extremely powerful sorceress and has been invoked by mortal magic users in the casting of spells. She can release powerful energy blasts, read other's thoughts, shape-shift, and alter the form of other people and objects. Her skill in magic is so great that when she warped reality around Brooklyn and its inhabitants, she did so without depending on external sources for increased magical power. She also has some influence over dogs and her presence alone causes all canines in a certain radius around her to become vicious.\n\nA human mutant character named Hecat'e appears in \"XSE 1\" (November 1996), created by John Ostrander and Chris Gardner.

{"id": "1599810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1599810", "title": "History of human sexuality", "text": "History of human sexuality\n\nThe social construction of sexual behavior—its taboos, regulation, and social and political impact—has had a profound effect on the various cultures of the world since prehistoric times.\n\nThe work of Swiss jurist Johann Bachofen made a major impact on the study of the history of sexuality. Many authors, notably Lewis Henry Morgan and Friedrich Engels, were influenced by Bachofen, and criticized Bachofen's ideas on the subject, which were almost entirely drawn from a close reading of ancient mythology. In his 1861 book \"Mother Right: An Investigation of the Religious and Juridical Character of Matriarchy in the Ancient World\" Bachofen writes that in the beginning human sexuality was chaotic and promiscuous. This \"aphroditic\" stage was replaced by a matriarchal \"demeteric\" stage, which resulted from the mother being the only reliable way of establishing descendants. Only upon the switch to male-enforced monogamy was paternity certainty possible, giving rise to patriarchy – the ultimate \"apolloan\" stage of humanity. While the views of Bachofen are not based on empirical evidence, they are important because of the impact they made on thinkers to come, especially in the field of cultural anthropology.\nModern explanations of the origins of human sexuality are based in evolutionary biology, and specifically the field of human behavioral ecology. Evolutionary biology shows that the human genotype, like that of all other organisms, is the result of those ancestors who reproduced with greater frequency than others. The resultant sexual behavior adaptations are thus not an \"attempt\" on the part of the individual to maximize reproduction in a given situation – natural selection does not \"see\" into the future. Instead, current behavior is probably the result of selective forces that occurred in the Pleistocene. For example, a man trying to have sex with many women all while avoiding parental investment is not doing so because he wants to \"increase his fitness\", but because the psychological framework that evolved and thrived in the Pleistocene never went away.\n\nSexual speech—and by extension, writing—has been subject to varying standards of decorum since the beginning of history. For most of historic time writing has not been used by more than a small part of the total population of any society. The resulting self-censorship and euphemistic forms translate today into a dearth of explicit and accurate evidence on which to base a history. There are a number of primary sources that can be collected across a wide variety of times and cultures, including the following:\n\nIndia played a significant role in the history of sex, from writing one of the first literature that treated sexual intercourse as a science, to in modern times being the origin of the philosophical focus of new-age groups' attitudes on sex. It may be argued that India pioneered the use of sexual education through art and literature. As in many societies, there was a difference in sexual practices in India between common people and powerful rulers, with people in power often indulging in hedonistic lifestyles that were not representative of common moral attitudes. Many of the common (and not so common) sexual practices in the world today, such as the custom and art of kissing emerged in India, proliferating with early forms of globalization.\n\nThe first evidence of attitudes towards sex comes from the ancient texts of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, the first of which are perhaps the oldest surviving literature in the world. These most ancient texts, the Vedas, reveal moral perspectives on sexuality, marriage and fertility prayers. Sex magic featured in a number of Vedic rituals, most significantly in the Asvamedha Yajna, where the ritual culminated with the chief queen lying with the dead horse in a simulated sexual act; clearly a fertility rite intended to safeguard and increase the kingdom's productivity and martial prowess. The epics of ancient India, the Ramayana and Mahabharata, which may have been first composed as early as 1400 BCE, had a huge effect on the culture of Asia, influencing later Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan and South East Asian culture. These texts support the view that in ancient India, sex was considered a mutual duty between a married couple, where husband and wife pleasured each other equally, but where sex was considered a private affair, at least by followers of the aforementioned Indian religions. It seems that polygamy was allowed during ancient times. In practice, this seems to have only been practiced by rulers, with common people maintaining a monogamous marriage. It is common in many cultures for a ruling class to practice polygamy as a way of preserving dynastic succession\n\nThe most publicly known sexual literature of India are the texts of the Kama Sutra. These texts were written for and kept by the philosopher, warrior and nobility castes, their servants and concubines, and those in certain religious orders. These were people that could also read and write and had instruction and education. The sixty four arts of love-passion-pleasure began in India. There are many different versions of the arts which began in Sanskrit and were translated into other languages, such as Persian or Tibetan. Many of the original texts are missing and the only clue to their existence is in other texts. Kama Sutra, the version by Vatsyayana, is one of the well-known survivors and was first translated into English by Sir Richard Burton and F. F. Arbuthnot. The Kama Sutra is now perhaps the most widely read secular text in the world. It details ways in which partners should pleasure each other within a marital relationship.\nWhen the Islamic and Victorian English culture arrived in India, they generally had an adverse impact on sexual liberalism in India. Within the context of the Indian religions, or dharmas, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, sex is generally either seen as a moral duty of each partner in a long term marriage relationship to the other, or is seen as a desire which hinders spiritual detachment, and so must be renounced. In modern India, a renaissance of sexual liberalism has occurred amongst the well-educated urban population, but there is still discrimination and forced marriage incidents amongst the poor.\n\nWithin certain schools of Indian philosophy, such as Tantra, the emphasis in sex as a sacred duty, or even a path to spiritual enlightenment or yogic balance is greatly emphasized. Actual sexual intercourse is not a part of every form of tantric practice, but it is the definitive feature of left-hand Tantra. Contrary to popular belief, \"Tantric sex\" is not always slow and sustained, and may end in orgasm. For example, the Yoni Tantra states: \"there should be vigorous copulation\". However, all tantra states that there were certain groups of personalities who were not fit for certain practices. Tantra was personality specific and insisted that those with pashu-bhava (animal disposition), which are people of dishonest, promiscuous, greedy or violent natures who ate meat and indulged in intoxication, would only incur bad karma by following Tantric paths without the aid of a Guru who could instruct them on the correct path. In Buddhist tantra, actual ejaculation is very much a taboo, as the main goal of the sexual practice is to use the sexual energy towards achieving full enlightenment, rather than ordinary pleasure. Tantric sex is considered to be a pleasurable experience in Tantra philosophy.\n\nIn the \"I Ching\" (The \"Book of Changes\", a Chinese classic text dealing with divination) sexual intercourse is one of two fundamental models used to explain the world. With neither embarrassment nor circumlocution, Heaven is described as having sexual intercourse with Earth. Similarly, with no sense of prurient interest, the male lovers of early Chinese men of great political power are mentioned in one of the earliest great works of philosophy and literature, the \"Zhuang Zi\" (or \"Chuang Tzu\", as it is written in the old system of romanization).\n\nChina has had a long history of sexism, with even moral leaders such as Confucius giving extremely pejorative accounts of the innate characteristics of women. From early times, the virginity of women was rigidly enforced by family and community and linked to the monetary value of women as a kind of commodity (the \"sale\" of women involving the delivery of a bride price). Men were protected in their own sexual adventures by a transparent double standard. While the first wife of a man with any kind of social status in traditional society was almost certainly chosen for him by his father and/or grandfather, the same man might later secure for himself more desirable sexual partners with the status of concubines. In addition, bondservants in his possession could also be sexually available to him. Naturally, not all men had the financial resources to so greatly indulge themselves.\n\nChinese literature displays a long history of interest in affection, marital bliss, unabashed sexuality, romance, amorous dalliances, homosexual alliances—in short, all of the aspects of behavior that are affiliated with sexuality in the West. Besides the previously mentioned \"Zhuang Zi\" passages, sexuality is exhibited in other works of literature such as the Tang dynasty \"Yingying zhuan\" (\"Biography of Cui Yingying\"), the Qing dynasty \"Fu sheng liu ji\" (\"Six Chapters of a Floating Life\"), the humorous and intentionally salacious \"Jin Ping Mei\", and the multi-faceted and insightful \"Hong lou meng\" (\"Dream of the Red Chamber\", also called \"Story of the Stone\"). Of the above, only the story of Yingying and her de facto husband Zhang fail to describe homosexual as well as heterosexual interactions. The novel entitled \"Rou bu tuan\" (\"Prayer mat of flesh\") even describes cross-species organ transplants for the sake of enhanced sexual performance. Among Chinese literature are the Taoist classical texts. This philosophical tradition of China has developed Taoist Sexual Practices which have three main goals: health, longevity, and spiritual development.\n\nThe desire for respectability and the belief that all aspects of human behavior might be brought under government control has until recently mandated to official Chinese spokesmen that they maintain the fiction of sexual fidelity in marriage, absence of any great frequency of premarital sexual intercourse, and total absence in China of the so-called \"decadent capitalist phenomenon\" of homosexuality. The result of the ideological demands preventing objective examination of sexual behavior in China has, until very recently, made it extremely difficult for the government to take effective action against sexually transmitted diseases, especially AIDS. At the same time, large migrations to the cities coupled with China's gender imbalance and significant amounts of unemployment have led to resurgence of prostitution in unregulated venues, a prominent accelerant of the propagation of STDs to many ordinary members of society.\n\nIn recent decades the power of the family over individuals has weakened, making it increasingly possible for young men and women to find their own sexual and/or marriage partners.\n\nIn what is often called the world's first novel, the \"Genji Monogatari\" (\"Tale of Genji\"), which dates back to around the eighth century AD, eroticism is treated as a central part of the aesthetic life of the nobility. The sexual interactions of Prince Genji are described in great detail, in an objective tone of voice, and in a way that indicates that sexuality was as much a valued component of cultured life as music or any of the arts. While most of his erotic interactions involve women, there is one telling episode in which Genji travels a fairly long distance to visit one of the women with whom he occasionally consorts but finds her away from home. It being late, and intercourse already being on the menu of the day, Genji takes pleasure in the availability of the lady's younger brother who, he reports, is equally satisfactory as an erotic partner.\n\nFrom that time on to at least as late as the Meiji Reformation, there is no indication that sexuality was treated in a pejorative way. In modern times homosexuality was driven out of sight until it reemerged in the wake of the sexual revolution with seemingly little if any need for a period of acceleration. Yukio Mishima, probably the best-known Japanese writer in the outside world, frequently wrote about homosexuality, and its relationship with Japanese culture new and old. Likewise, prostitution, pornography, the tradition of the Geisha, and countless types of fetish and sadomasochism have resurfaced after decades underground.\n\nIn Japan, sexuality was governed by the same social forces that make its culture considerably different from that of China, Korea, India, or Europe. In Japanese society, the primary method used to secure social control is the threat of ostracism. Japanese society is still very much a shame society. More attention is paid to what is polite or appropriate to show others than to which behaviors might make a person seem \"corrupt\" or \"guilty\", in the Christian sense of the words. The tendency of people in Japanese society to group in terms of \"in groups\" and \"out groups\" - residue of its long history as a caste society – is a source of great pressure on every facet of society, via pop culture (reflected in the tribal, often materialistic, and very complex nature of teenage subcultures) as well as more traditional standards (as in the high-pressure role of the salaryman). Sexual expression ranges from a requirement to a complete taboo, and many, especially teenagers, find themselves playing many otherwise strictly-separate roles during the week.\n\nA frequent locus of misconceptions in regard to Japanese sexuality is the institution of the geisha. Rather than being a prostitute, a geisha was a woman trained in arts such as music and cultured conversation, and who was available for non-sexual interactions with her male clientele. These women differed from the wives that their patrons probably had at home because, except for the geisha, women were ordinarily not expected to be prepared for anything other than the fulfillment of household duties. This limitation imposed by the normal social role of the majority of women in traditional society produced a diminution in the pursuits that those women could enjoy, but also a limitation in the ways that a man could enjoy the company of his wife. The geisha fulfilled the non-sexual social roles that ordinary women were prevented from fulfilling, and for this service they were well paid. The geisha were not deprived of opportunities to express themselves sexually and in other erotic ways. A geisha might have a patron with whom she enjoyed sexual intimacy, but this sexual role was not part of her role or responsibility as a geisha.\n\nAs a superficial level, in traditional Japanese society women were expected to be highly subservient to men and especially to their husbands. So, in a socionormal description of their roles, they were little more than housekeepers and faithful sexual partners to their husbands. Their husbands, on the other hand, might consort sexually with whomever they chose outside of the family, and a major part of male social behavior involves after-work forays to places of entertainment in the company of male cohorts from the workplace—places that might easily offer possibilities of sexual satisfaction outside the family. In the postwar period this side of Japanese society has seen some liberalization in regard to the norms imposed on women as well as an expansion of the de facto powers of women in the family and in the community that existed unacknowledged in traditional society.\n\nIn the years since people first became aware of the AIDS epidemic, Japan has not suffered the high rates of disease and death that characterize, for example, some nations in Africa, some nations in Southeast Asia, etc. In 1992, the government of Japan justified its continued refusal to allow oral contraceptives to be distributed in Japan on the fear that it would lead to reduced condom use, and thus increase transmission of AIDS. As of 2004, condoms accounted for 80% of birth control use in Japan, and this may explain Japan's comparably lower rates of AIDS.\n\nIn ancient Greece, the phallus, often in the form of a herma, was an object of worship as a symbol of fertility. This finds expression in Greek sculpture and other artworks. One ancient Greek male idea of female sexuality was that women envied penises of males. Wives were considered as commodity and instruments for bearing legitimate children. They had to compete sexually with eromenoi, hetaeras and slaves in their own homes.\n\nBoth Homosexuality and Bisexuality, in the form of ephebophilia (in some ways slavery), were social institutions in ancient Greece, and were integral to education, art, religion, and politics. Relationships between adults were not unknown but they were disfavored. Lesbian relations were also of a pederastic nature.\n\nIn ancient Greece, it was common for men to have sexual relationships with youths. These practices were a sign of maturity for youths, who looked up to men as sexual mentors.\n\nAncient Greek men believed that refined prostitution was necessary for pleasure and different classes of prostitutes were available. Hetaera, educated and intelligent companions, were for intellectual as well as physical pleasure, Peripatetic prostitutes solicited business on the streets, whereas temple or consecrated prostitutes charged a higher price. In Corinth, a port city, on the Aegean Sea, the temple held a thousand consecrated prostitutes.\n\nRape – usually in the context of warfare – was common and was seen by men as a “right of domination”. Rape in the sense of \"abduction\" followed by consensual lovemaking was represented even in religion: Zeus was said to have ravished many women: Leda in the form of a swan, Danaë disguised as a golden rain, Alkmene disguised as her own husband. Zeus also raped a boy, Ganymede, a myth that paralleled Cretan custom.\n\nThe ancient Etruscans had very different views on sexuality, when compared with the other European ancient peoples, most of whom had inherited the Indo-European traditions and views on the gender roles.\n\nGreek writers, such as Theopompus and Plato named the Etruscan 'immoral' and from their descriptions we find out that the women commonly had sex with men who were not their husbands and that in their society, children were not labelled \"illegitimate\" just because they did not know who the father was. Theopompus also described orgiastic rituals, but it is not clear whether they were a common custom or only a minor ritual dedicated to a certain deity.\n\nThe citizen's duty to control his body was central to the concept of male sexuality in the Roman Republic. \"Virtue\" \"(virtus\", from \"vir\", \"man\") was equated with \"manliness.\" The equivalent virtue for female citizens of good social standing was \"pudicitia\", a form of sexual integrity that displayed their attractiveness and self-control. Female sexuality was encouraged within marriage. In Roman patriarchal society, a \"real man\" was supposed to govern both himself and others well, and should not submit to the use or pleasure of others. Same-sex behaviors were not perceived as diminishing a Roman's masculinity, as long as he played the penetrative or dominating role. Acceptable male partners were social inferiors such as prostitutes, entertainers, and slaves. Sex with freeborn male minors was formally prohibited (see \"Lex Scantinia\"). \"Homosexual\" and \"heterosexual\" thus did not form the primary dichotomy of Roman thinking about sexuality, and no Latin words for these concepts exist.\n\nDepictions of frank sexuality are abundant in Roman literature and art. The \"fascinum\", a phallic charm, was a ubiquitous decoration. Sexual positions and scenarios are depicted in great variety among the wall paintings preserved at Pompeii and Herculaneum. Collections of poetry celebrated love affairs, and \"The Art of Love\" by the Augustan poet Ovid playfully instructed both men and women in how to attract and enjoy lovers. Elaborate theories of human sexuality based on Greek philosophy were developed by thinkers such as Lucretius and Seneca. Classical myths often deal with sexual themes such as gender identity, adultery, incest, and rape.\n\nLike other aspects of Roman life, sexuality was supported and regulated by traditional Roman religion, both the public cult of the state and private religious practices and magic. Cicero held that the desire to procreate \"(libido)\" was \"the seedbed of the republic,\" as it was the cause for the first form of social institution, marriage, which in turn created the family, regarded by the Romans as the building block of civilization. Roman law penalized sex crimes \"(stuprum)\", particularly rape, as well as adultery. A Roman husband, however, committed the crime of adultery only when his sexual partner was a married woman.\n\nProstitution was legal, public, and widespread. Entertainers of any gender were assumed to be sexually available (see \"infamia\"), and gladiators were sexually glamorous. Slaves lacked legal personhood, and were vulnerable to sexual exploitation.\n\nThe dissolution of Republican ideals of physical integrity in relation to political liberty contributes to and is reflected by the sexual license and decadence associated with the Roman Empire. Anxieties about the loss of liberty and the subordination of the citizen to the emperor were expressed by a perceived increase in passive homosexual behavior among free men. Sexual conquest was a frequent metaphor for Roman imperialism.:)\n\nThe Islands have been noted for their sexual culture. Many sexual activities seen as taboo in western cultures were viewed as appropriate by the native culture. Contact with Western societies has changed many of these customs, so research into their pre-Western social history has to be done by reading antique writings.\n\nChildren slept in the same room as their parents and were able to witness their parents while they had sex. Intercourse simulation became real penetration as soon as boys were physically able. Adults found simulation of sex by children to be funny. As children approached 11 attitudes shifted toward girls.\n\nPremarital sex was not encouraged but was allowed in general, restrictions on adolescent sexuality were incest, exogamy regulations, and firstborn daughters of high-ranking lineage. After their firstborn child, high-ranking women were permitted extramarital affairs.\n\nAdam Johann von Krusenstern in his book about the same expedition as Yuri's, reports that a father brought a 10-12-year-old girl on his ship, and she had sex with the crew. According to the book of Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu and Étienne Marchand, 8-year-old girls had sex and performed other sexual acts in public.\n\nThe second sexual revolution was a substantial change in sexual morality and sexual behaviour throughout the West in the 1960s and early 1970s. One factor in the change of values pertaining to sexual activities was the invention of new, efficient technologies for the personal control of ability to enter pregnancy. Prime among them, at that time, was the first birth control pill. Liberalized laws on abortion in many countries likewise made it possible to safely and legally break off an unwanted pregnancy without having to invoke a birth posing grave danger to the health of the mother.\n\nSocietal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death.\n\nIn a detailed compilation of historical and ethnographic materials of pre-industrial cultures, \"strong disapproval of homosexuality was reported for 41% of 42 cultures; it was accepted or ignored by 21%, and 12% reported no such concept. Of 70 ethnographies, 59% reported homosexuality absent or rare in frequency and 41% reported it present or not uncommon.\" \n\nIn cultures influenced by Abrahamic religions, the law and the church established sodomy as a transgression against divine law or a crime against nature. The condemnation of anal sex between males, however, predates Christian belief. It was frequent in ancient Greece; \"unnatural\" can be traced back to Plato.\n\nMany historical figures, including Socrates, Lord Byron, Edward II, and Hadrian, have had terms such as \"gay\" or \"bisexual\" applied to them; some scholars, such as Michel Foucault, have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary construction of sexuality foreign to their times, though others challenge this.\n\nA common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. John Boswell has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by Plato, which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.\n\nIn Jewish law, sex is not considered intrinsically sinful or shameful when conducted in marriage, nor is it a necessary evil for the purpose of procreation. Sex is considered a private and holy act between a husband and wife. Certain deviant sexual practices, enumerated below, were considered gravely immoral \"abominations\" sometimes punishable by death. The residue of sex was considered ritually unclean outside the body, and required ablution.\n\nRecently, some scholars have questioned whether the Old Testament banned all forms of homosexuality, raising issues of translation and references to ancient cultural practices. However, rabbinic Judaism had unambiguously condemned homosexuality.\n\n\nThe Torah, while being quite frank in its description of various sexual acts, forbids certain relationships. Namely, adultery, all forms of incest, male homosexuality, bestiality, and introduced the idea that one should not have sex during the wife's period:\n\nThe above passages may, however, be open to modern interpretation. The original meanings of these verses did not change, but their interpretation may have changed after they were translated into English and other languages. This view however, has been counteracted by conservatives.\n\nChristianity re-emphasised the Jewish attitudes on sexuality with two new concepts. First, there was the re-iterated idea that marriage was absolutely exclusive and indissoluble, placing further guidance on divorce and expanding on the reasons and principles behind those laws. Second, in Old Testament times marriage was almost universal, in continuity with the total matrimony in Eden, but in the New Testament, the trajectory is extended forward to the goal of no marriage in the new heavens and new earth (see Matthew 22). Practically therefore the new age after Jesus now has marriage as only normative, but celibacy is a valuable gift in and of itself.\n\nThe New Testament is quite clear on principles regarding sexual relations. In one of his letters to the Corinthian church, Paul directly answers some questions they had asked about this.\n\nPaul is speaking into a situation where the church was falling into lust, and some members even using prostitutes (6:16), while others advocated a 'higher spirituality' that wrongly denied pleasure from earthly things, including abstinence from sex (7:1). Paul writes to them to explain the right context for sex in marriage, and the importance of couples keeping having sex and giving each other pleasure, but encourages them to pursue celibacy (as he later explains [7:32-35], so that they may devote more time and energy to others) wherever God has granted that gift (7:7).\n\nMany other passages refer to sex or marriage.\n\nSt. Augustine opined that before Adam's fall, there was no lust in the sexual act, but that it was entirely subordinate to human reason. Later theologians similarly concluded that the lust involved in sexuality was a result of original sin, but nearly all agreed that this was only a venial sin if conducted within marriage without inordinate lust.\n\nIn Reformed schools, as represented for example by the Westminster Confession, three purposes of marriage are drawn out: for mutual encouragement, support, and pleasure; for having children; and to prevent lustful sin.\n\nToday, many Christians have adopted the view that there is no sin whatsoever in the uninhibited enjoyment of marital relations. Some Christians will tend to limit the circumstances and degree to which sexual pleasure is morally licit, for example to build self-control to prevent sex becoming addictive, or as a fast.\n\nIn India, Hinduism accepted an open attitude towards sex as an art, science and spiritual practice. The most famous pieces of Indian literature on sex are Kamasutra (Aphorisms on Love) and Kamashastra (from Kama = pleasure, shastra = specialised knowledge or technique). This collection of explicit sexual writings, both spiritual and practical, covers most aspects of human courtship and sexual intercourse. It was put together in this form by the sage Vatsyayana from a 150 chapter manuscript that had itself been distilled from 300 chapters that had in turn come from a compilation of some 100,000 chapters of text. The Kamasutra is thought to have been written in its final form sometime between the third and fifth century AD.\n\nAlso notable are the sculptures carved on temples in India, particularly the Khajuraho temple. The frank depiction of uninhibited sex hints towards a liberated society and times where people believed in dealing openly with all aspects of life. On the other hand, a group of thinkers believe that depiction of sexually implicit carvings outside the temples indicate that one should enter the temples leaving desires (kama).\n\nApart from Vatsyayana's Kamashastra, which is no doubt the most famous of all such writings, there exist a number of other books, for example:\n\nThe \"Secrets of Love\" was written by a poet named Kukkoka. He is believed to have written this treatise on his work to please one Venudutta, considered to be a king. This work was translated into Hindi years ago and the author's name became Koka in short and the book he wrote was called \"Koka Shastra\". The same name crept into all the translations into other languages in India. \"Koka Shastra\" literally means doctrines of Koka, which is identical with the \"Kama Shastra\", or doctrines of love, and the names \"Koka Shastra\" and \"Kama Shastra\" are used indiscriminately.\n\nIn Islam sexual intercourse is allowed only after marriage and only with one's spouse. Sex outside of marriage is prohibited, called zina, as is adultery, which is considered a sin and is strictly prohibited and punishable. According to the chapter Al-Israa', verse 32 of the Qur'an, Allah (God) prohibits Muslims from getting close to (engaging in) zina, and having relations with anyone other than one's spouse. And since marriage is only between a man and a woman, any sexual intercourse between two men is prohibited. Islam does not accept homosexuality or allow anal sex even between married couples or even during menstrual cycles. Furthermore, sex is like an act of charity if done with right intentions. One cannot seek sexual means outside of marriage and must lower gaze when outside.\n\nIn the mid 20th century advances in medical science and modern understanding of the menstrual cycle led to observational, surgical, chemical and laboratory techniques to allow diagnosis and the treatment of many forms of infertility.\n\nMany cultures normalized or promoted adult males and male youths, usually teenagers, entering into pedagogic friendships or love affairs that also had an erotic dimension. These were usually sexually expressed, but chaste ones were not infrequent. If sexual, that phase of the relationship lasted until the youth was ready for adulthood and marriage. Other cultures saw such relationships as inimical to their interests – often on religious grounds – and tried to stamp them out.\n\nZoophilia or bestiality—sexual activity between humans and animals—probably dates back to prehistory. Depictions of humans and animals in a sexual context appear infrequently in rock art in Europe beginning around the onset of the Neolithic and the domestication of animals. Bestiality remained a common theme in mythology and folklore through the classical period and into the Middle Ages (e.g. \"Leda and the Swan\") and several ancient authors purported to document it as a regular, accepted practice – albeit usually in \"other\" cultures.\n\nExplicit legal prohibition of human sexual contact with animals is a legacy of the Abrahamic religions: the Hebrew Bible imposes the death penalty on both the person and animal involved in an act of bestiality. There are several examples known from medieval Europe of people and animals executed for committing bestiality. With the Age of Enlightenment, bestiality was subsumed with other sexual \"crimes against nature\" into civil sodomy laws, usually remaining a capital crime.\n\nBestiality remains illegal in most countries. Though religious and \"crime against nature\" arguments may still be used to justify this, today the central issue is the ability of non-human animals to give consent: it is argued that sex with animals is inherently abusive. In common with many paraphilias, the internet has allowed the formation of a zoophile community that has begun to lobby for zoophilia to be considered an alternative sexuality and for the legalisation of bestiality.\n\nProstitution is the sale of sexual services, such as oral sex or sexual intercourse. Prostitution has been described as the \"world's oldest profession\". Gonorrhoeae is recorded at least up to 700 years ago and associated with a district in Paris formerly known as \"Le Clapiers\". This is where the prostitutes were to be found at that time.\n\nIn some cultures, prostitution has been an element of religious practices. Religious prostitution is well documented in the ancient cultures of the near East, such as Sumer, Babylon, ancient Greece and Israel, where prostitutes appear in the Bible. In Greece the hetaerae were often women of high social class, whereas in Rome the meretrices were of lower social order. The Devadasi, prostitutes of Hindu temples in south India, were made illegal by the Indian government in 1988.\n\nFor much of human history, sexually transmitted diseases have been a scourge of humanity. They raged unchecked through society until the discovery of antibiotics. The development of inexpensive condoms and education about sexually transmitted diseases has helped reduce risks. For a period of about thirty years (in the second half of the twentieth century) their threat subsided. However, due to the free movement of people and uncontrolled distribution of antibiotics, organisms resistant to antibiotics quickly spread and at the present time pose a threat to people who have more than one sex partner.\n\nAIDS has profoundly changed modern sexuality. It was first noticed (although many historians feel that the first case was in 1959) spreading among gay men and intravenous drug users in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, the majority of victims are heterosexual women, men, and children in developing countries. In most developing countries, fear of epidemic has drastically changed many aspects of twentieth century human sexuality. Fear of contracting AIDS has driven a revolution in sex education, which now centers far more the use of protection and abstinence, and spends much more time discussing sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nFurther effects of this disease run deep, radically impacting the expected average lifespan as reported by the BBC News: \"[The expected average lifespan] is falling in many African countries – a girl born today in Sierra Leone could expect only to live to 36, in contrast to Japan, where today's newborn girl might reach 85 on average.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2246680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246680", "title": "Itelmen language", "text": "Itelmen language\n\nItelmen (autonym: \"itənmən\") or Western Itelmen, formerly known as Western Kamchadal, is a language of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan family spoken on the western coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Fewer than a hundred native speakers, mostly elderly, in a few settlements in the southwest of Koryak Autonomous Okrug, remained in 1993. The 2002 Census counted 3,180 ethnic Itelmens, virtually all of whom are now monolingual in Russian. However, there are attempts to revive the language, and it is being taught in a number of schools in the region.\n\n(Western) Itelmen is the only surviving Kamchatkan language. It has two dialects, Sedanka and Xajrjuzovo (Ukä).\n\nOriginally the Kamchatkan languages were spoken throughout Kamchatka and possibly also in the northern Kuril Islands. Vladimir Atlasov, who annexed Kamchatka and established military bases in the region, estimated in 1697 that there were about 20,000 ethnic Itelmens. The explorer Stepan Krasheninnikov, who gave the first detailed description of the Itelmen language and culture, identified the three main dialects, but explained that all Itelmens could understand each other.\n\nFrom the time of Atlasov, Russian fur traders began to settle in the region. There were frequent clashes between Cossacks and Itelmens, who rebelled against Russian domination. Many Itelmen were forcibly converted to Christianity, and by the early nineteenth century all Itelmen were forced to adopt Russian names. Intermarriage with Russian settlers led to the development of a creole known as Kamchadal, traces of which remain in the Russian dialect now spoken in Kamchatka.\n\nDuring the Soviet era the process of assimilation intensified, as Itelmen communities were moved by force and children were sent to boarding schools where they were required to speak Russian. By the end of the 1930s Russian was the medium of instruction in all schools, and children grew up speaking Russian as their main language.\n\nHowever it was also during this period that Itelmen was written down for the first time. In 1930, a Latin-based alphabet was designed for all the native languages of northern Siberia, and in 1932, a 27-letter Itelmen alphabet was created. A few textbooks were written in this alphabet during the 1930s, but it was quickly abandoned. More recently, a Cyrillic-based alphabet, designed in 1986 and consisting of 32 letters, has been used.\n\nItelmen is now highly endangered, and most speakers are aged over sixty and live in scattered communities. However, there is a movement to revive the language, and educational materials are being developed. Modern Itelmen has been heavily influenced by Russian lexically, phonologically and grammatically.\n\nItelmen has a larger phonological inventory than other Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages, and permits complex consonant clusters in some environments. However, Itelmen has a different system of vowel harmony than its relatives Chukchi and Koryak.\n\nVolodin (1997) gives the following consonant inventory, shown here with both the Cyrillic and IPA forms. Itelmen is unusual in having a voicing (VOT) distinction in fricatives but not in plosives.\n\nIn addition to the consonants shown above, some sources also include the glottal stop , as well as glottalised nasal and lateral phonemes, including , , and . 's' and 'z' may be apical post-alveolar fricatives rather than alveolar fricatives. There may also be distinct labialised consonant phonemes.\n\nThere are five vowel phonemes: and . Schwa () also appears but its phonemic status is unclear.\n\nThere are two points of view about where Itelmen belongs genetically. According to the first theory, Itelmen and Chukotkan languages derived from a common proto-language; the sharp differences of Itelmen, noticed at all levels, are explained by the intense influence of other languages; it is suggested that Itelmen absorbed a different non-Chukotko-Kamchatkan language. According to the second theory, Itelmen is not related to other Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages; common elements are due to contact.\n\nInitial comparisons of the basic Itelmen lexicon to Chukotkan show that only a third of the word stock is cognate. This result is preliminary due to the incompleteness of Chukotko-Kamchatkan comparative phonetics. Arends et al. (1995) state that Itelmen is a mixed language, with Chukotkan morphology and a lexicon from a separate language, possibly related to Gilyak or Wakashan. Itelmen would thus be a creole of a Luorawetlan language and Gilyak/Wakashan just as Kamchadal became a creole of Itelmen and Russian. However, Fortescue (2005) partially reconstructed the Chukotko-Kamchatkan proto-language. See Kamchatkan languages#Classification.\n\nThere may be different answers given to the question of which elements of Itelmen are original and which have been brought about by contact with other languages. To take the second hypothesis, Itelmen was at the very beginning an agglutinative language, with word structure (m) + R + (m) (where R is a root and (m) one of several word-changing morphemes), it was nominal, compounds were prohibited; it preserves all of these elements into the present. A difference in reported material origin with Chukotko-Koryak languages in declensional and conjugational paradigms is the result of convergent development under conditions of a Chukotko-Kamchatkan Sprachbund. Incorporation goes against word structure (not more than one root morpheme), thus Itelmen did not take it on. Reduplication of a root, inherent to all the languages of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan group, was able to develop in Itelmen apart from the influence of contact.\n\nRussian borrowings in Itelmen already started to appear in the 17th century. Among the Russian words that were borrowed, in some cases replacing Itelmen words, adjectives and adverbs predominate and even preserve Russian morphology: \"vostr-oy\" sharp-, \"krasn-oy\" red-, \"sinny-oy\" blue-, \"svez-oy\" fresh-, etc. Borrowed verbs adapt in accordance with the demands of Itelmen morphology: Itel. \"stara'lkas\" (Rus. \"starat'sya\") means 'to try', Itel. \"otkaza'lkas\" (Rus. \"otkazyvat'sya\") 'to deny,' It. \"napraves\" means 'to cook food'. To speak of Russian borrowings in Itelmen today is hardly possible, because all Itelmens speak Russian much better than their native language.\n\nThe Itelmen language is an agglutinative language, it has affixes for nouns and verbs, and most of its affixes are suffixes.\n\nIts basic word order is subject–object–verb, numerals and demonstratives are placed before the noun they modify, although adjectives can be placed before or after the noun they modify.\n\nItelmen is not standardized and does not have a separate literary variety. A retelling of Itelmen mythology was written in Russian by Krasheninnikov. Folk language (only recordings from the 20th century survive, Western language) does not show special characteristics compared to the conversational language.\n\nWriting based on Latin graphemes was introduced in 1932 (an alphabet book and arithmetic textbook were published). Teaching from the alphabet book of 1932 (authored by ethnographer Elizabeth Porfirevna Orlova and co-produced by a group of Itelmen students) lasted several years; but after alphabets for \"Northern\" languages were transformed into Cyrillic at the end of the 1930s, Itelmen writing was abolished. Itelmen became an unwritten language and remained that way for almost a half century.\n\nThe modern Itelmen alphabet was created in 1984 on a Cyrillic base and in 1988 was confirmed by the Russian Ministry of Education. A second Itelmen alphabet book was created in 1988. An Itelmen-Russian/Russian-Itelmen dictionary and second-grade textbook were also published. In 1993 the Itelmen alphabet book was republished. Itelmen has been taught as a subject in elementary grades, but teachers do not speak the language like the students. In 2002 a translation of the Gospel of Luke was published in Itelmen. All of these works are published in the Southern dialect.\n\nA deepening sign (˚) and glottal stop sign (ʼ) are also used in instructional works. In the sequence of instructionally published signs Ă ă, Ŏ ŏ, Ў ў are not considered separate letters. Also, in many publications \"Ԓ ԓ\" and \"Ӽ ӽ\" are used in place of the letters \"Ԯ ԯ (Ӆ ӆ)\" and \"Ҳ ҳ\" (for example in the \"Historical Ethnographic Handbook of Itelmen\", Krasnodar, 2005).\n\nThe newspaper \"Native of Kamchatka\", which regularly publishes works in Itelmen, does not use the letters 'Ă ă, Ŏ ŏ, Ў ў but does use the deepening sign (˚).\n\n\n"}

Sinclair, a Scotland Yard chief inspector, battles all kinds of undead and demonic creatures. The series appears weekly and has been running since 1973. The full title is \"Geisterjäger John Sinclair\", ghosthunter John Sinclair. While falling into the category of 'pulp fiction', the ongoing series is yet remarkable for the relatively wide range of its vocabulary and the inventiveness of its plots.\n\nAlmost all John Sinclair stories in the series have been written exclusively by Helmut Rellergerd under the nom-de-plume of Jason Dark. Only a few of the earliest stories have been written by other authors. As of late, creation of new stories is divided among Rellergard and several new authors, each of them writing separate full episodes; the new writers are attributed for their respective stories. Over the decades the Spanish painter Vicenç Badalona Ballestar has created numerous paintings and illustrations for the bestselling series.\n\nRellergerd narrates the stories in first person from Sinclair's point of view whenever he is involved. At all other times a neutral narrator style is used. In some stories Sinclair does not appear and one of his friends takes the leading part.\n\n\nMost bad guys are destroyed by the end of a novel, but some arch-villains come up quite often against Sinclair until he finds a way to get rid of them permanently. Due to the horror nature of most of the creatures, some return even after being destroyed, most notably Vincent van Akkeren who started mortal and had to be killed 3 times by powers of the light before he stayed dead.\n\n\nRellergerd never states exactly which Christian denomination John Sinclair or any of his team is a member of. The silver bullets are made by a Catholic abbot, even though most of the team probably belong to a Protestant variant of Christianity. Suko and Shao are Buddhists.\n\nThere has been some scholarly engagement with the Sinclair novels of Jason Dark, particularly as regards their author's powers of imagination and inventiveness, and a positive assessment has on occasion been expressed. Tony Page comments:\n\n\"Jason Dark’s imaginative powers have rightly been\npraised. Indeed, Godden writes: ‘As regards imagination,\nJason Dark towers houses high in superiority above Sherlock\nHolmes creator, Conan Doyle.’ (Godden, 207: 293). This is\neminent praise indeed-and is justly bestowed. The sheer\ninexhaustible inventiveness which Dark displays week upon\nweek, in novel after novel, is testimony to a fertility of\nimagination which can rightly lay claim to lie within the\nrealm of genius.\"\n\n"}

Yeshivas in other parts of the world also have a vacation period during these holidays known as Bein Hazmanim.\n\nA seasonal subcategory of the Kosher tourism industry is travel for Passover, a period of a week that otherwise involves special preparation of the personal home and kitchen. It includes specially designed all-inclusive Passover cruises and resorts.\n\nThe week-long holiday of Sukkot involves the need to eat meals and sleep in a sukkah which destinations and locations wishing to attract observant Jews will build, either for eating only, or overnight use as well.\n\nDuring the holiday of Hanukkah, places such as Modi'in are popular for those who want to see the historical sites where many of the events leading up to the Maccabean Revolt took place.\n\nAnother subcategory of the Kosher tourism industry is tourism products geared toward the Haredi community. This segment of the Kosher tourism industry has a potential customer base of about 800,000 households. Important aspects of this segment of the industry include separate hours for men and women at swimming pools and beaches and the hotels might remove televisions or Internet access from rooms and the lobby.\n"}

Her glamorous persona and publicized personal troubles have contributed to her recurring prevalence in popular culture. \n\nTurner first entered the popular culture lexicon under the nickname \"the Sweater Girl\" due to her feature film debut in \"They Won't Forget\" (1937), in which she appeared in a form-fitting sweater that accentuated her bust. She was the first known person to be given the nickname, which went on to be applied to numerous actresses throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Her subsequent rise to fame at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and establishment as a sex symbol enhanced Turner's profile, and she became a popular pin-up model throughout World War II. \n\nWhile she enjoyed significant popularity as one of MGM's biggest stars, she was also subject to vociferous media attention over her numerous romantic affairs, eight total marriages, and her daughter's 1958 killing of Turner's lover, Johnny Stompanato, during a domestic struggle. The media focus on her storied personal life (particularly the Stompanato homicide) contributed to her cultural prevalence at the time, even sometimes serving as the basis for novels and films.\n\nIn her later career and after her death, Turner would go on to appear depicted in numerous artistic works, as well as be studied by social critics and academics in discussions surrounding Hollywood, film theory, gay icons, and camp aesthetics. \n\nThe story of Turner's chance discovery by William Wilkerson at a Hollywood malt shop at age 16 was widely circulated during her lifetime, and went on to become a part of Hollywood mythology. Varied accounts as to where the discovery occurred were recounted in publication and via word of mouth during her early career in the late 1930s and early 1940s, with a popular retelling having the meeting occur at Schwab's Pharmacy. Shortly after Turner's rise to fame, the owner of the malt shop in which the discovery took place erected a metal plaque on the seat which Turner had occupied when she met Wilkerson, and soon the shop became inundated with young women hoping to experience the same chance occurrence. Wilkerson's son, journalist William Wilkerson III, wrote on the lasting cultural impact of Turner's discovery in 1995: \n\nScholar Kim Fields similarly wrote about the lasting cultural relevance of Turner and her discovery story in her 2007 book \"An Intimate Affair: Women, Lingerie, and Sexuality\", noting that it is emblematic of \"the American Dream fulfilled ... Because of her, being discovered at a soda fountain has become almost as cherished an ideal as being born in a log cabin.\"\n\nFollowing her feature film debut in Mervyn LeRoy's \"They Won't Forget\" (1937), Turner was the first woman to receive the nickname the \"Sweater Girl\" due to her form-fitting attire which accentuated her bust. Though she herself detested the nickname, it was one with which she became synonymous over the duration of her career, and it would come to be applied to several actresses throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Several years after the release of \"They Won't Forget\", \"Modern Screen\" journalist Nancy Squires wrote an extensive article on Turner, in which she noted that she had \"made a sweater look like something Cleopatra was saving for the next visiting Caesar.\" \n\nTurner's rise to fame and establishment as a Hollywood sex symbol following \"They Won't Forget\" was concurrent with World War II, and she became a prominent pin-up model at the time, appearing painted on the noses of U.S. fighter planes bearing the title \"Tempest Turner.\" MGM appointed her to tour the United States West Coast and sell war bonds in various cities in the summer of 1942. During the tour, Turner began giving out kisses to the highest buyers, and by the end of the 10-week tour, had sold $5.25 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in war bonds.\n\nOne of the earliest popular culture references to Turner is in Frank Sinatra's 1944 recorded version of \"Nancy (with the Laughing Face).\" During this time, Turner and Sinatra had been carrying on a romantic affair. She would later be named in Nina Simone's 1958 version of the song \"My Baby Just Cares for Me,\" which appeared on her album \"Little Girl Blue\".\nIn 1962, writer Harold Robbins published the novel \"Where Love Has Gone\", which was inspired by the scandal surrounding Turner after her daughter, Cheryl Crane, stabbed her lover, Johnny Stompanato, to death during a domestic struggle in their Beverly Hills home. A film adaptation of the novel was made in 1964. In response to the release of the novel and film, Turner told a journalist: \"I suppose I'll be getting bugged by that question.\" The same year, poet Frank O'Hara wrote the poem \"Lana Turner has collapsed\" (1964), which was based on a headline he had seen stating that Turner had collapsed at a social gathering. \n\nIn 1985, artist Andy Warhol produced a silkscreen print of Turner in her youth, and she was photographed by Warhol in Polaroid the same year; one Polaroid image from the shoot would later sell in auction for $3,750.\n\nWriter James Ellroy depicted Turner again (alongside Stompanato) in his 1990 novel \"L.A. Confidential\" (1990). Brenda Bakke went on to portray her in a scene of the 1995 film adaptation by director Curtis Hanson. Also in 1990, Turner was referenced on the rap section of Madonna's \"Vogue\" next to stars from the Golden Age era of Hollywood such as Rita Hayworth, Lauren Bacall, and Marilyn Monroe. Despite her recurring prevalence in popular culture, upon her death in 1995, writer and critic John Updike wrote in \"The New Yorker\" that Turner \"was a faded period piece, an old-fashioned glamour queen whose fifty-four films, over four decades didn't amount, retrospectively to much ... As a performer, she was purely a studio-made product.\" \nIn 2002, Turner was commemorated by artist Eloy Torrez in an outdoor mural, \"Portrait of Hollywood\", painted on the auditorium of Hollywood High School, her alma mater, alongside numerous other famous alumni. American singer-songwriter Elizabeth Grant ( 1985), better known as Lana Del Rey, devised her stage name inspired by Turner and the Ford Del Rey sedan. A 2011 article on Del Rey in \"The New Yorker\" described Turner as a \"titan of red-lip, Old Hollywood glamour.\"\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, it was observed by journalist Sally Quinn of \"The Washington Post\" that Turner had accumulated a following of gay men, similar to her contemporaries Judy Garland, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, and others. One attendee at a 1975 gala celebrating her career told Quinn: \"She represents ... homosexuals' fantasies at a certain age in their lives. They identify with her and she's a survivor. It's like their saying, 'Let's go see how she's survived.'\" Subsequent associations with Turner as a gay icon have centered on her personal struggles and triumphs, as well as her glamorous persona and the perceived camp aesthetics of several of her films. Scholars such as Susan Sontag noted the camp qualities of such films as \"The Prodigal\" (1955), a Biblical costume drama in which Turner portrayed a pagan temptress.\nScholar Georges-Claude Guilbert notes Turner's impact as a gay icon as far back as her appearance \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" (1946): \"[Upon the release of \"Imitation of Life\",] Turner's gay iconocity quotient had already reached a very high level 12 years previously with the release of \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" Even 70 years later one never comes out unscathed from a viewing. The head wrap! The shoes! The shorts! That movie is a lesson in style and in it, Turner is a lesson in stylishness.\" Additionally, Guilbert notes Turner's personal scandals (such as the 1958 Stompanato killing), frequent romances and eight-total marriages as additional factors in her consideration as a gay icon. Scholar Robin Griffiths also considers Turner a \"camp icon\" due to her \"alternately deadpan and overblown performances.\" Author Sam Staggs noted of Turner in \"Imitation of Life\": \n\n\n"}

Several well-developed Somali forms of verse include the \"gabay\", \"jiifto\", \"geeraar\", \"wiglo\", \"buraanbur\", \"beercade\", \"afarey\" and \"guuraw\". The gabay (epic poem) has the most complex length and meter, often exceeding 100 lines. It is considered the mark of poetic attainment when a young poet is able to compose such verse, and is considered the height of poetry. Groups of memorizers and reciters (\"hafidayaal\") traditionally propagated the well-developed art form. Poems revolve around several main themes, including \"baroorodiiq\" (elegy), \"amaan\" (praise), \"jacayl\" (romance), \"guhaadin\" (diatribe), \"digasho\" (gloating) and \"guubaabo\" (guidance). The baroorodiiq is composed to commemorate the death of a prominent poet or figure. The Afar are familiar with the \"ginnili\", a kind of warrior-poet and diviner, and have a rich oral tradition of folk stories. They also have an extensive repertoire of battle songs.\n\nAdditionally, Djibouti has a long tradition of Islamic literature. Among the most prominent such historical works is the medieval \"Futuh Al-Habash\" by Shihāb al-Dīn, which chronicles the Adal Sultanate army's conquest of Abyssinia during the 16th century. In recent years, a number of politicians and intellectuals have also penned memoirs or reflections on the country.\n"}

{"id": "31321387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31321387", "title": "Old High German lullaby", "text": "Old High German lullaby\n\nThe discovery of an Old High German lullaby () was announced in 1859 by Georg Zappert (1806—1859) of Vienna, a private scholar and collector of medieval literature.\nOstensibly a 10th-century poem full of surviving pre-Christian mythology, it is considered a literary forgery of Zappert by many experts who have commented on it.\n\nAccording to Zappert, in 1852 he noted some words in Old High German on a strip of parchment glued to the spine of a 15th-century paper manuscript (Hofbibliothek Codex Suppl. No. 1668). Zappert says he purchased the manuscript in August 1858, as the recovering of the strip necessitated the destruction of the manuscript binding. Zappert reports that, once the strip was recovered, it turned out it bore an Old High German poem, apparently a lullaby, in five lines, in a hand of the 9th or 10th century:\n\nZappert reads this as seven alliterating verses, as follows:\ntranslated: \"(1) \"Docke\", sleep speedily / leave off crying // (2) \"Triuwa\" forcefully / fends off the murdering wolf // (3) May you sleep until morning / dear man's son // (4) \"Ostara\" for the child leaves / honey and sweet eggs // (5) \"Hera\" for the child breaks / flowers blue and red // (6) \"Zanfana\" on the morrow sends // white little sheep // (7) and One-Eye, \"herra hurt\", swift, hard spears.\"\n\"Docke\" is a term of endearment addressing the child. Triuwa is \"truth\" personified, Ostara is a hypothetical spring goddess, here portrayed as \"leaving eggs for the child\", which would be a striking attestation of a pagan origin of easter egg customs. Also extremely striking would be the survival of Tanfana, a theonym only attested by Tacitus in the 1st century, in Old High German form. \"One-Eye\" would be Wotan, also a very striking confirmation of the Eddaic tradition of Odin being one-eyed, otherwise unattested in West Germanic sources. \n\nPreceding the Old High German text is a line in Hebrew, , a list of seven words from a glossary. On the back of the parchment is another line in Hebrew, , a fragment of two verses of Proverbs (the end of 3:13 and the beginning of 6:6). These appear to be pen trials. Based on this Zappert surmises (p. 12) that the manuscript is due to an early German Jew, perhaps a rabbi or physician, recording a lullaby he may have heard from a wetnurse employed in his house.\n\nSome of the vowels of the lullaby are given in the form of Hebrew vowel points.\n\nIf authentic, the text would afford a rich source for Germanic paganism, giving more detail on the deities mentioned even than the Merseburg Incantations (discovered 1841). Johann Kelle (1860) had scathing criticism for Zappert's analysis, disagreeing with literally every one of Zappert's conclusions and emendations, but did not question the authenticity of the document. Jacob Grimm in \"Berliner Sitzungsberichte\", 1859, 254—58 refers to Zappert's publication as an independent attestation of the name \"Zanfana\", apparently without doubting its authenticity. In fact, Edwards (2002, p. 150) claims that J. Grimm intended to publish a defence of the lullaby, and “stood out from the beginning because of his enthusiastic advocacy of the lullaby”.\n\nBut Grohmann (1861) in a 46-page essay examines the poem in detail and concludes that it is clearly a falsification. \nSince Zappert had died in 1859, he could not defend his position. \n\nKletke (1867) still considers the text genuine, but the mainstream opinion in the late 19th century and until today remains Grohmann's. Nevertheless, there have been a few 20th-century scholars defending the poem's authenticity (see Diamant 1960, Howard 1976). \n\nFichtenau (1970) again concludes that without a doubt, the poem is a falsification. Edwards (2002, p. 158) states that from six essays which appeared on the topic of the lullaby during the 20th century, three consider it a forgery, while three declare it as genuine. Edwards himself (p. 161) concludes that the evidence adduced in his essay against the authenticity of the lullaby “points more than one finger of suspicion, but falls short of certainty”.\n\nArguments in favour of the authenticity:\n\nArguments against the authenticity:\n\n\n"}

Such bills would leave the nickel, at five cents, as the lowest-value coin in the United States.\n\nIn 1990, United States Representative Jim Kolbe [R-AZ] introduced the Price Rounding Act of 1989, H.R. 3761 to eliminate the penny in cash transactions, rounding to the nearest nickel.

Act of 2017, that would stop minting of the penny for ten years and would study the question of whether production could cease thereafter.\n\nSince March 29, 2017, S. 759 has been in the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee.\n\n\n\nAs of 2017, nickels cost 5.94 cents to produce, providing an argument for elimination similar to the penny's production at a loss. The face value of a nickel is also well below that of the lowest-denomination coin (the penny) at the time of the half-cent's elimination in 1857. Unlike the penny, the nickel is mostly redundant (when exchanging dollars and cents, if is not 5–9 or 15–19, the amount can be given without nickels and still weigh less, with at most one additional coin, than if a nickel is included) and less commonly used; the nickel is nonetheless accepted by most vending machines while the penny is not. No bills have yet been proposed to remove the nickel from circulation; however, if the composition of the nickel were to be changed from the present 75/25 copper-nickel alloy to stainless steel, which has been successfully used in many countries, the nickel would cost far less than five cents to produce. The US Mint has studied other alternative metal mixtures and an 80/20 copper-nickel alloy would lower the cost of the nickel (albeit it still would likely be minted at a loss) while desirably allowing coin sorting machines to function without modification.\n\n\nEconomist François R. Velde has suggested an alternative plan in which the government would make the penny worth five cents. This change would cause an inflation of nearly six billion dollars.\n\nCongress passed the Coin Modernization, Oversight, and Continuity Act of 2010, which requires the Treasury to report on possible new metallic coin materials.\n\nMany countries outside the United States have chosen to remove low-value coins from circulation:\n\n\nHowever, many nations still use coins of similar or smaller value to the United States cent. In some cases, while the nominal value of the coin may be smaller than that of a US cent, the purchasing power may be higher:\n\nOn April 17, 2007, a Department of the Treasury regulation went into effect prohibiting the treatment, melting, or mass export of pennies and nickels. Exceptions were allowed for numismatists, jewelry makers, and normal tourism demands. The reason given was that the price of copper was rising to the point where these coins could be melted for their metal content. In 1969, a similar law regarding silver coinage was repealed. Because their silver content frequently exceeds collector value, silver coins are often sold by multiplying their \"face value\" times a benchmark price that floats relative to the spot silver price per ounce. According to American law, US citizens are allowed to melt foreign coinage (e.g., Canadian pennies) for personal or commercial use.\n\n\n"}

Although piano burning ceremonies are now popular in both the Royal Air Force and the United States Air Force, there is little or no evidence to suggest that descriptions of its origin have any historical authenticity. According to one version of its origin, pianos were set alight by RAF pilots to avoid piano lessons aimed at improving their dexterity and general level of culture, however there is no evidence of this myth. Another version is that piano burning began in World War II in remembrance of fallen RAF pilots. Several contemporary musicians, including Annea Lockwood, Yōsuke Yamashita, and Diego Stocco, have composed for and performed on pianos which have been deliberately set alight. A burning piano was also the centrepiece of Douglas Gordon's 2012 video installation, \"The End of Civilisation\".\n\nIn \"The Phantom in Focus: A Navigator's Eye on Britain's Cold War Warrior\", David Gledhill recounts a combat training exercise in Germany during the Cold War where Jaguar pilots from RAF Wildenrath and RAF Bruggen had the task of destroying a piano placed on Nordhorn Ridge with a single practice bomb. Because the target was so small, it was only the last Jaguar on the last flight of the exercise that finally managed to hit it. The pilots from both bases celebrated that evening at RAF Wildenrath by burning a second piano in the Officers' Mess. Although piano burning has become popular with air forces and especially the Royal Air Force since World War II, its origin is undocumented and has been the subject of myth and decades of storytelling.\n\nOne of the most common legends traces its origin to the British Royal Air Force sometime between World War I and II when so many pilots died during World War I that the RAF was forced to select its pilots from the common population, instead of their usual preference for upper-class families. Attempts were made to educate the pilots on refined manners and tastes, but these lessons became very unpopular among the pilots, especially the piano lessons which the Royal Air Force believed would increase the pilots' level of culture and improve their dexterity. According to this story, the burning began at RAF Leuchars, where the only piano at the base burned down accidentally and piano lessons were cancelled. Word spread, and soon pilots at more and more Royal Air Force bases began to burn the pianos to avoid lessons. This version is unverified and largely mythological. Another legendary version of the tradition's origin holds that RAF piano burning began as a tribute to fallen airmen. According to the \"New Zealand Herald\", a piano-playing pilot in the Royal Air Force during World War II played to his fellow airmen each time one of their number had been killed. When he himself was killed in action, his comrades decided that \"if he couldn't play the piano any more, nobody would, so they dragged it outside and set it alight.\"\n\nPiano burning ceremonies based on the RAF tradition are also held by the US Air Force. A piano was ceremonially burnt at Langley Air Force Base in 2011 to celebrate the 94th anniversary of the 94th Fighter Squadron. At Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, the 4th Fighter Wing burns a piano each year in commemoration of the Battle of Britain, while Vance Air Force Base sometimes celebrates the graduation of trainee pilots with a piano burning.\n\nAlthough piano burning ceremonies are primarily carried out by the UK and US air forces, the Roxbury Tavern near Sauk City, Wisconsin has held an annual piano burning ceremony since 2004 to mark the Summer Solstice. A eulogy for the piano is delivered prior to it being set alight, and afterwards its remains are placed on display in the tavern's garden along with those of burnt pianos from previous years.\n\nIn 1968, New Zealand composer Annea Lockwood wrote a piece called \"Piano Burning\". The score specifies that the performer uses an upright piano that is beyond repair. In the composers words, \nPiano burning should really be done with an upright piano; the structure is much more beautiful than that of a grand when you watch it burn. The piano must always be one that’s irretrievable, that nobody could work on, that no tuner or rebuilder could possibly bring back. It’s got to be a truly defunct piano.\" She asks the performer to soak paper in lighter fluid, set it alight, and drop it into the piano. She also specifies that balloons may be attached, and the piano may be played for as long as the performer is able. \"Piano Burning\" is a part of her \"Piano Transplants\" series, which also includes \"Piano Drowning\", \"Piano Garden\", and \"Southern Exposure\".\n\nYōsuke Yamashita first performed on a burning piano in 1973, when asked by Japanese graphic designer Kiyoshi Awazu to be the subject in his short film, \"burning piano\". 35 years later, at the age of 66, Yamashita re-watched the film and was inspired to repeat the performance. Dressed in a protective firefighter's uniform, Yamashita improvised on the burning piano during sunset on a beach in western Japan. He said of the experience,\nI did not think I was risking my life but I was almost suffocating from the smoke that was continuously getting into my eyes and nose. I had decided to keep on playing until the piano stopped making sounds, so though I did not mean it but it ended up having a life-or-death battle between the piano and myself.\" \nThe pianos used for both of Yamashita's performances were donated, decade-old broken ones.\n\nDiego Stocco composed a piece called \"The Burning Piano\", which is made up entirely of his recordings of a burning piano. Stocco began the burning process by pointing a butane lighter directly towards the strings and played single notes, and after the flame was extinguished he played with what remained. He recorded the entire process and later rearranged samples to create the piece of music. The virtual instrument company Spectrasonics created a sample library called Omnisphere which includes a \"Burning Piano\" sample recorded by Stocco.\n\nMichael Hannan's compositions have often involved pieces for pianos which have been altered in some way, including being set on fire. His 2003 \"Burning Questions\", a radiophonic work commissioned by ABC Radio National, explored the \"cultural politics of auto-destructive music\" and included the sounds of a burning baby grand piano (with a microphone placed inside), the observers' reactions, and Hannan playing Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\" on the piano immediately prior to setting it alight. According to Hannan:\nThe act of burning a piano [...] stimulates a strong emotional response from an audience. I became more interested in the crowd's response than in the sounds made from the piano itself.\nThe piano burning which forms the basis of the work had taken place on 2 October 1999 at Bellingen, New South Wales. The composer Barry Conyngham, one of the observers at the burning, was heard to remark that he found \"burning a perfectly good microphone more sacrilegious than burning a piano.\"\n\nThe destruction of musical instruments, often by fire, was a recurrent theme in Arman's work. Two of his most notable works involving piano burning were his 1965 \"Piano de Néron\" (Nero's Piano) and his 1966 \"Piano Flamboyant\" (Flaming Piano). The burning for \"Piano Flamboyant\" took place on the roof of Arman's atelier in Nice and was filmed for a documentary by Gérard Patris which was later broadcast on French national television. As with his other burnt instrument works, which also included violins, cellos, and guitars, the charred remains were then mounted on panels or enclosed in plexiglas. One of Arman's earliest works of piano destruction was his 1962 \"Chopin's Waterloo\" which took at the Galerie Saqqârah in Gstaad. On that occasion rather than burning the piano, the artist hacked it to pieces with an axe.\n\nSeveral of Chiharu Shiota's installations have featured a piano which she had set alight with the charred remains then displayed in an installation of black thread. As part of the 2011 MONA FOMA arts festival, Shiota set the piano alight on a street in Hobart, Tasmania. According to Shiota, the inspiration came from a childhood experience when she saw a charred piano amidst the ruins of a neighbour's house which had burnt down in the night.\n\nDouglas Gordon's 2012 video installation \"The End of Civilisation\" was centred on a burning grand piano placed in the isolated landscape of Cumbria on the border between Scotland and England. According to Gordon:\nA piano started to represent for me the ultimate symbol of western civilisation. Not only is it an instrument, it's a beautiful object that works as a sculpture but it has another function entirely.\n\nThe work, displayed simultaneously on multiple screens, consists of close-up film of the burning piano from the moment it is set alight until it is reduced to ashes juxtaposed with a second film which is a 360 degree pan of the Scottish Borders landscape surrounding the piano. After its premiere at the Tyne Theatre and Opera House in July 2012, \"The End of Civilisation\" was shown at the London 2012 Festival and toured as part of a Douglas Gordon retrospective in Tel Aviv followed by screenings in Venice, New York, and Berlin.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "95323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95323", "title": "Solfège", "text": "Solfège\n\nIn music, solfège (, ; ) or solfeggio (; ), also called sol-fa, solfa, solfeo, among many names, is a music education method used to teach pitch and sight singing of Western music. Solfège is a form of solmization, and though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, the systems used in other music cultures such as \"swara\", \"durar mufaṣṣalāt\" and \"Jianpu\" are discussed in their respective articles.\n\nSyllables are assigned to the notes of the scale and enable the musician to audiate, or mentally hear, the pitches of a piece of music which he or she is seeing for the first time and then to sing them aloud. Through the Renaissance (and much later in some shapenote publications) various interlocking 4, 5 and 6-note systems were employed to cover the octave. The tonic sol-fa method popularized the seven syllables commonly used in English-speaking countries: \"do\" (or \"doh\" in tonic sol-fa), \"re\", \"mi\", \"fa\", \"so(l)\", \"la\", and \"si\" (or \"ti\"), see below).\n\nThere are two current ways of applying solfège: 1) fixed do, where the syllables are always tied to specific pitches (e.g. \"do\" is always \"C-natural\") and 2) movable do, where the syllables are assigned to scale degrees (\"do\" is always the first degree of the major scale).\n\nItalian \"solfeggio\" and English/French \"solfège\" derive from the names of two of the syllables used: \"sol\" and \"fa\".\n\nThe generic term \"solmization\", referring to any system of denoting pitches of a musical scale by syllables, including those used in India and Japan as well as solfège, comes from French \"solmisatio\", from the Latin solfège syllables \"sol\" and \"mi\".\n\nThe verb \"to sol-fa\" means to sing a passage in solfège.\n\nIn eleventh-century Italy, the music theorist Guido of Arezzo invented a notational system that named the six pitches of the hexachord after the first syllable of each line of the Latin hymn \"Ut queant laxis\", the \"Hymn to St. John the Baptist\", yielding \"ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la\". Each successive line of this hymn begins on the next scale degree, so each pitch's name was the syllable sung at that pitch in this hymn.\n\n<poem>\nUt queant laxīs    resonāre fībrīs\nMīra gestōrum    famulī tuōrum,\nSolve pollūtī    labiī reātum,\nSancte Iōhannēs.\n</poem>\nThe words were written by Paulus Diaconus in the 8th century. They translate as:\n<poem>\nSo that your servants may,    with loosened voices,\nResound the wonders    of your deeds,\nClean the guilt    from our stained lips,\nO St. John.\n</poem>\n\"Ut\" was changed in the 1600s in Italy to the open syllable Do, at the suggestion of the musicologue Giovanni Battista Doni (based on the first syllable of his surname), and Si (from the initials for \"Sancte Iohannes\") was added to complete the diatonic scale. In Anglophone countries, \"si\" was changed to \"ti\" by Sarah Glover in the nineteenth century so that every syllable might begin with a different letter. \"Ti\" is used in tonic sol-fa (and in the famed American show tune \"Do-Re-Mi\").\n\nAn alternative theory argues that the solfège syllables (\"do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti\") derive from the syllables of an Arabic solmization system درر مفصّلات \"Durar Mufaṣṣalāt\" (\"Separated Pearls\") (\"dāl, rā', mīm, fā', ṣād, lām, tā\"'), mentioned in the works of Francisci a Mesgnien Meninski in 1680 and later discussed by Jean-Benjamin de La Borde in 1780. However, there is no documentary evidence for this theory.\n\nIn the Elizabethan era, England and its related territories used only four of the syllables: mi, fa, sol, and la. \"Mi\" stood for modern si, \"fa\" for modern do or ut, \"sol\" for modern re, and \"la\" for modern mi. Then, fa, sol and la would be repeated to also stand for their modern counterparts, resulting in the scale being \"fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa\". The use of \"fa\", \"sol\" and \"la\" for two positions in the scale is a leftover from the Guidonian system of so-called \"mutations\" (i.e. changes of hexachord on a note, see Guidonian hand). This system was largely eliminated by the 19th century, but is still used in some shape note systems, which give each of the four syllables \"fa\", \"sol\", \"la\", and \"mi\" a different shape.\n\nAn example of this type of solmization occurs in Shakespeare's \"King Lear\", I, 2 (see ).\n\nThere are two main types of solfège \"Movable do\" and \"Fixed Do\".\n\nIn \"Movable do\", or \"tonic sol-fa\", each syllable corresponds to a scale degree. This is analogous to the Guidonian practice of giving each degree of the hexachord a solfège name, and is mostly used in Germanic countries, Commonwealth Countries, and the United States.\n\nOne particularly important variant of movable do, but differing in some respects from the system described below, was invented in the nineteenth century by Sarah Ann Glover, and is known as tonic sol-fa.\n\nIn Italy, in 1972, Roberto Goitre wrote the famous method \"Cantar leggendo\", which has come to be used for choruses and for music for young children.\n\nThe pedagogical advantage of the movable-Do system is its ability to assist in the theoretical understanding of music; because a tonic is established and then sung in comparison to, the student infers melodic and chordal implications through his or her singing. Thus, while fixed-do is more applicable to instrumentalists, movable-do is more applicable to theorists and, arguably, composers.\n\nMovable do is frequently employed in Australia, China, Japan (with 5th being so,and 7th being si), Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States, Hong Kong, and English-speaking Canada. The movable do system is a fundamental element of the Kodály method used primarily in Hungary, but with a dedicated following worldwide. In the movable do system, each solfège syllable corresponds not to a pitch, but to a scale degree: The first degree of a major scale is always sung as \"do\", the second as \"re\", etc. (For minor keys, see below.) In movable do, a given tune is therefore always sol-faed on the same syllables, no matter what key it is in.\n\nThe solfège syllables used for movable do differ slightly from those used for fixed do, because the English variant of the basic syllables (\"ti\" instead of \"si\") is usually used, and chromatically altered syllables are usually included as well.\n\nIf, at a certain point, the key of a piece modulates, then it is necessary to change the solfège syllables at that point. For example, if a piece begins in C major, then C is initially sung on \"do\", D on \"re\", etc. If, however, the piece then modulates to G major, then G is sung on \"do\", A on \"re\", etc., and C is then sung on \"fa\".\n\nPassages in a minor key may be sol-faed in one of two ways in movable do: either starting on do (using \"me\", \"le\", and \"te\" for the lowered third, sixth, and seventh degrees, and \"la\" and \"ti\" for the raised sixth and seventh degrees), which is referred to as \"do-based minor\", or starting on la (using \"fi\" and \"si\" for the raised sixth and seventh degrees). The latter (referred to as \"la-based minor\") is sometimes preferred in choral singing, especially with children.\n\nThe choice of which system is used for minor makes a difference as to how you handle modulations. In the first case (\"do-based minor\"), when the key moves for example from C major to C minor the syllable do keeps pointing to the same note, namely C, (there's no \"mutation\" of do's note), but when the key shifts from C major to A minor (or A major), the scale is transposed from do = C to do = A. In the second case (\"la-based minor\"), when the key moves from C major to A minor the syllable do keeps point to the same note, again C, but when the key moves from C major to C minor the scale is transposed from do = C to do = E-flat.\n\nIn \"Fixed do\", each syllable corresponds to the name of a note. This is analogous to the Romance system naming pitches after the solfège syllables, and is used in Romance and Slavic countries, among others, including Spanish speaking countries.\n\nIn the major Romance and Slavic languages, the syllables Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, and\nSi are used to name notes the same way that the letters C, D, E, F, G, A, and B are used to name notes in English. For native speakers of these languages, solfège is simply \"singing the names of the notes\", omitting any modifiers such as \"sharp\" or \"flat\" in order to preserve the rhythm. This system is called fixed do and is used in Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Belgium, Romania, Latin American countries and in French-speaking Canada as well as countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Russia, Serbia, Ukraine, Georgia, Bulgaria, Greece, Armenia, Albania, Macedonia, Mongolia, Iran, Taiwan, Middle East, Turkey, and Israel where non-Romance languages are spoken. In the United States of America, the fixed-do system is principally taught at The Juilliard School in New York City and the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.\n\nIn the fixed do system, shown above, accidentals do not affect the syllables used. For example, C, C, and C (as well as and , not shown above) are all sung with the syllable \"do\".\n\nSeveral chromatic fixed-do Systems that have also been devised to account for chromatic notes (and even for double-sharp and double-flat variants) are as follows:\n\nMovable Do corresponds to our psychological experience of normal tunes. If the song is sung a tone higher it is still perceived to be the same song, and the notes have the same relationship to each other, but in a fixed Do all the note names would be different. A movable Do emphasizes the musicality of the tune as the psychological perception of the notes is always relative to a key for the vast majority of people that do not have absolute pitch.\n\nSotorrio argues that fixed-do is preferable for serious musicians, as music involving complex modulations and vague tonality is often too ambiguous with regard to key for any movable system. That is, without a prior analysis of the music, any movable-do system would inevitably need to be used like a fixed-do system anyway, thus causing confusion. With fixed-do, the musician learns to regard any syllable as the tonic, which does not force them to make an analysis as to which note is the tonic when ambiguity occurs. Instead, with fixed-do the musician will already be practiced in thinking in multiple/undetermined tonalities using the corresponding syllables.\n\nIn comparison to the movable do system, which draws on short-term relative pitch skills involving comparison to a pitch identified as the tonic of the particular piece being performed, fixed do develops long-term relative pitch skills involving comparison to a pitch defined independently of its role in the piece, a practice closer to the definition of each note in absolute terms as found in absolute pitch. The question of which system to use is a controversial subject among music educators in schools in the United States. While movable do is easier to teach and learn, some feel that fixed do leads to stronger sight-reading and better ear training because students learn the relationships between specific pitches as defined independently, rather than only the function of intervals within melodic lines, chords, and chord progressions. Of course, this argument is only valid if the fixed do is used with chromatic solfège syllables.\n\nIf a performer has been trained using fixed do, particularly in those rare cases in which the performer has absolute pitch or well-developed long-term relative pitch, the performer may have difficulty playing music scored for transposing instruments: Because the \"concert pitch\" note to be performed differs from the note written in the sheet music, the performer may experience cognitive dissonance when having to read one note and play another. Especially in the early stages of learning a piece, when the performer has yet to gain familiarity with the melodic line of the piece as expressed in relative terms, he or she may have to mentally re-transpose the sheet music in order to restore the notes to concert pitch.\n\nThose trained in fixed-do will argue that their act is the analogue of reading aloud in a language. Just as one reads this very sentence without parsing it grammatically, so too fixed-do is the direct sounding of the music. Where the movable-do system requires constant real-time analysis of the tonality and modulations in the score, in fixed-do the musician uses knowledge of the changing tonality to understand for example that the pitch class c-natural is the supertonic in B-Flat major or minor, and the dominant when the music modulates to F-major, but the c-note remains the same pitch.\n\nInstrumentalists who begin sight-singing for the first time in college as music majors find movable do to be the system more consistent with the way they learned to read music.\n\nFor choirs, sight-singing fixed do using chromatic movable do syllables (see below) is more suitable than sight-singing movable do for reading atonal music, polytonal music, pandiatonic music, music that modulates or changes key often, or music in which the composer simply did not bother to write a key signature. It is not uncommon for this to be the case in modern or contemporary choral works.\n\nIn the countries with fixed-do, these seven syllables (with Si instead of Ti) are used to name the notes of the C-Major scale, instead of the letters C, D, E, F, G, A and B. (For example, they would say, \"Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is in Re minor, but its third movement is in Si-bemol major.\") In Germanic countries, the letters are used for this purpose, and the solfège syllables are encountered only for their use in sight-singing and ear training. (They would say, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is in \"d-Moll\" (D minor).)\n\nIsaac Newton had associated the seven solfège syllables with the seven colors of the rainbow and surmised that each color vibrated accordingly (a concept possibly related to the modern view of chromesthesia). Thus, red has the least amount of vibration while violet vibrates the most.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Staining is used for biochemical research, metal staining, and art (e.g., wood staining, stained glass).\n\nThere can be intentional stains (such as wood stains or paint), indicative stains (such as food coloring or adding a substance to make bacteria visible under a microscope), natural stains (such as rust on iron or a patina on bronze), and accidental stains such as ketchup on a shirt.\n\nDifferent types of material can be stained by different substances, and stain resistance is an important characteristic in modern textile engineering.\n\nThe primary method of stain formation is surface stains, where the staining substance is spilled out onto the surface or material and is trapped in the fibers, pores, indentations, or other capillary structures on the surface. The material that is trapped coats the underlying material, and the stain reflects back light according to its own color. Applying paint, spilled food, and wood stains are of this nature.\n\nA secondary method of stain involves a chemical or molecular reaction between the material and the staining material. Many types of natural stains fall into this category.\n\nFinally, there can also be molecular attraction between the material and the staining material, involving being held in a covalent bond and showing the color of the bound substance.\n\nIn many cases, stains are affected by heat and may become reactive enough to bond with the underlying material. Extreme heat, such as from ironing or dry cleaning, can cause a chemical reaction on an otherwise removable stain, turning it into a chemical compound that is impossible to remove.\n\nVarious laundry techniques exist to attempt to remove or minimize existing stains, and stain removers are an important type of chemical in laundry detergents. Some stand-alone stain removers also exist. If the wrong technique is used to remove the stain or stain mark on the clothing it could actually cause permanent damage to the clothing.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13271762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13271762", "title": "Territory band", "text": "Territory band\n\nTerritory bands were dance bands that crisscrossed specific regions of the United States from the 1920s through the 1960s. Beginning in the 1920s, the bands typically had 8 to 12 musicians. These bands typically played one-nighters, 6 or 7 nights a week at venues like VFW halls, Elks Lodges, Lions Clubs, hotel ballrooms, and the like. Francis Davis, jazz critic for The Village Voice, likened territory bands to \"the Top 40 cover bands (of the 1970s and 1980s) of their day, typically relying on stock arrangements of other ensembles' hits.\" He said, \"many historians give much credit to territory bands for popularizing modern ballroom dancing that began during the World War I era with the influence of Vernon and Irene Castle.\"\n\nTerritory bands helped disseminate popular music — which included swing, jazz, sweet dance music, or any combination thereof — bringing it to remote gin mills and dance halls that were otherwise ignored by national booking agents representing genuine recording stars like Ellington and Armstrong. Many developed original repertoires and signature sounds, none more storied than Walter Page's Blue Devils, the Oklahoma City-based outfit that Count Basie joined in 1926.\n\nThere were black bands and white bands, and bands of various immigrant ethnicities. There were also all-female bands, such as the International Sweethearts of Rhythm.\n\nMusician, composer, and scholar Gunther Schuller asserted in one of his books, \"The Swing Era: The Development of Jazz, 1930–1945 (The History of Jazz, Vol. 2)\" that, \"territory bands, by definition, were black. There were, of course, many white bands in the 'territories' but they tended to have the more lucrative and permanent jobs and therefore not required to travel as much as the black bands.\" Another musician (former territory band musician and historian), Jack Behrens, expressed in a book that Schuller's depiction of divergent work conditions was narrow. \"During my playing days in the 1940s and 50s in several white territory bands, we didn't have \"lucrative and permanent jobs\" unless you count day labor in a dairy bar or clerking at a military surplus store. Worse, there were times we didn't get paid at all and we had little recourse given the cost of legal advice.\"\n\nFor most territory bands — whether black, white, integrated, male, female — the musicians were nearly always paid. Neither the booking agencies nor the musicians got rich, but regular salaries helped maintain pretty decent musicianship.\n\nMost musicians witnessed and experienced a wide variety of Jim Crow practices, from city to city and region to region. One common present-day misconception is that Jim Crow practices were more prevalent in the South. The practices were prevalent everywhere, especially in New York City and the Midwest. The bands that were racially integrated commonly experienced problems, mostly from having to dodge different applications and degrees of Jim Crow among cities and regions. Many bands, especially The International Sweethearts of Rhythm, handled some of the absurdities with a degree of inward, sarcastic humor. When musicians grew wary or even felt vulnerable to injustices of Jim Crow, the band bus, for those who had one, served as a safe haven.\n\nThe published history of territory bands is thin. Most of what we know comes from fading memories and second-hand anecdotes. With a lack of discography and the passing of a generation, our knowledge is slipping. While many territory bands were of high quality, they rarely recorded and were often unfairly considered minor league to the national touring bands. Moreover, they were confined to specific regions or states … even parts of a state. Ambitious and hopeful young musicians saw territory bands as a training ground for, or rite of passage to, the major big bands. The alumni of territory band musicians who matriculated to fame within the industry reads like list of \"who's who\" in music.\n\nTerritory bands typically played more sweet music, though, some in the mid 1950s, particularly those with talented musicians, managed to entertain dancers with a jazzier sound. But dancing audiences are what kept the bands employed. In the 1920s, territory bands commonly traveled by car (station wagon), followed by an equipment truck for the PA system, guitar amplifiers and drum kit. Later, beginning in the mid-1930s, territory bands commonly traveled in sleeper trailers.\n\nHome territories were loosely defined, but some classifications emerged. Generally, the areas were defined as Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, West Coast, Southwest and Northwest. In addition, some state-groupings became common.\n\nMINK was a particularly distinguished state group. It was composed of Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas.\n\nVSA was composed of Virginia, South Carolina and Alabama.\n\nThe Southwest proved especially fertile for territory bands. Texas, with its spread-out geography and relatively large population, offered the greatest opportunity with developed markets for dance music in Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio, Austin, Amarillo, and other cities. The homegrown audiences of Texas bands were so plentiful that the bands developed to a high degree in relative isolation from outside influences. One such band was that of Alphonso Trent.\n\nBands out of Los Angeles and Seattle performed not only in California, Oregon, and Washington, but also Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana. The Glenn Henry Orchestra, which got its first big break playing summers at Yellowstone Park from 1935 to 1940, became a popular West Coast territory band.\n\nThere were military territories, too — NCO Clubs, Officers' Clubs. These clubs took bands to Greenland, Nova Scotia, Bermuda, Puerto Rico, as well as the US.\n\nThe musicians in the territory dance bands were primarily jazz musicians. Despite the overwhelming view that New Orleans was the cradle of jazz, the itinerant musicians were the ones who first disseminated it.\n\nThe dancing public could actually dance and they knew which bands swung and which simply just played well. Audiences responded with great enthusiasm to the black bands in the Midwest. The East Coast black bands were popular in the 1920s; but \"Swing\" came to that region in the form of Louis Armstrong joining the Fletcher Henderson band when he went to the Big Apple.\n\nTerritory bands were not all swing bands. The Midwest settlements of Europeans of various ethnicities brought their community dancing and revelry with them in the form of very popular polka bands (and also old time waltzes, leandlers, and schottisches). They played at all the ballrooms, Elk Clubs, and the like as well. Here's a short exemplary list:\n\nThere were traveling bands well before the 1920s & 30s. One of many examples were musicians who did their booking from Redfield, South Dakota. Redfield was a railroad hub in the Northern Plains. All their booking was up and down the rail line.\n\nIn 1924, according to Variety, there were more than 900 dance bands, representing steady work for 7,200 musicians. There were 68 Whiteman orchestras across the country, playing music from the Whiteman library, eleven in New York alone. In the mid-20s, bands typically had ten musicians: two altos, one tenor (who often doubled on other woodwinds and sometimes violin), two trumpets, trombone, banjo or guitar, piano, string bass or brass bass, and drums. Sometimes there were two trombones. If the band had only two saxophones, they would be alto and tenor.\n\nThe Great Depression, which hit bottom in 1933, was hard on territory bands. The public strained to afford entertainment. It was not uncommon for bands to be stranded for lack of funds. Many broke up during this period.\n\nThere are many theories on why swing music and territory bands declined. Here are a few:\n\nIn the history of traveling dance bands, all female bands are often excluded, or only given minor inclusion. Popular culture seemed to regard the musical performances dance bands provided as an area meant to be dominated by men. In the scenarios where women were allowed to join in, they were often denoted as separate. This is seen in the way many female singers were nicknamed “canaries,” denoting them not as musicians, but as pretty objects meant to be on display. One example that shows just how foreign women could be considered appears in the name of a band Mary Lou Williams headed that was called \"Six Men and a Girl.\" Oftentimes these stereotypes surrounding performing women extended to instrumentalists.\n\nAll female performers were not a new idea in the dawn of traveling jazz bands though. All women groups performing American genres of music dates back to minstrel groups like Madame Rentz’s Female Minstrels. Because women could not easily enter prestigious music bands that were essentially all male, all women groups continuously popped up as groups that allowed skilled female musicians to perform. Sometimes they were put together with help from outside sources. It was not uncommon for a group to be put together by a man or a talent agency, but to consist of all female performers. Sometimes performers received aide from family or friends involved in the business to help get their foot in the door. For instance, Lil Hardin Armstrong had an all woman dance band in the early 1930s. This group went by such names as \"Lil Armstrong and Her Swing Band.\" Other bands popular in the 1930s include The Harlem Playgirls, The Dixie Sweethearts, the Darlings of Rhythm, and Gertrude Long and Her Rambling Night Hawks.\n\nEven banding together with other women though, public perception would sometimes view all female bands as “all-girl gimmicks.” Some talented musicians avoided joining all female bands in the fear that their talent would be disregarded in such a context. Yet all female bands were also forced into the feminine appearances they were also demeaned for. In many ways, this made being in a traveling dance band more difficult for women than it had been for men. After a night spent traveling women were expected to be visions of beauty with perfect make up, hair, and personalities. Often the ultra feminine clothes they had to wear, such as strapless dress and high heels, also affected their ability to play and perform. As had been shown in previous attempts women had made to broach men’s groups, attempting to break away from this dainty female image could call the sexuality and morality of a performer into question. Yet women’s performances were also often debased to their visual looks and sexual attractiveness, even though many reviewers criticized them for these elements.\n\nA certain need to prove themselves seemed to exist among many of the female musicians who worked in dance bands. These performers inherited a lot of the stereotypes that surrounded their previous female performer counterparts: chorus line girls and girl singers. The sexual objectification of women that haunted those two careers was also a part of being in an all female band. Furthermore, chorus line girls had an association with loose morals and even prostitution, and loss of face for an instrumentalist could mean the end of a career. These kinds of associations also made many people assume that female instrumentalists were not talented players. Upon interviewing later in life, many women insisted that they were talented musicians who knew how to play. This insistence seems to be in direct reaction to the claims that circulated that female musicians were not meant to play well but simply to look pretty. While it’s true that many agencies required photos in their applications to join female bands, the musicians in them still tended to be quite talented.\n\nWhile many people view the end of the Swing era as the opening of World War II, this was not the case for all woman dance bands. Instead, they flourished during the 1940s. Swing music became a form of patriotism to a country at war. The all-girl bands that did the best at this time tended to be groups formed before American involvement in the war. Once it was realized that women could fill a major hole in the entertainment industry and that they could not be drafted, agencies and managers everywhere began trying to put together all female bands. In many ways, these musicians were very prepared to take over for the men because they had more advanced experience in playing instruments, either from hobbies or school bands. They were certainly more prepared for musical performance than many women were prepared for welding and factory work. Some groups connected to academic organizations, such as the International Sweethearts of Rhythm or the Prairie View Co-eds did very well at this time. These groups of industrious young women could come to represent an image of what the United States was at war for. Some of these groups even did USO tours. Soldiers shipped off to foreign lands, under the pressure war and deprived of any female presence were more than welcoming to these all woman groups. The armed audiences were known to have shown extreme appreciation for these female performers V-discs, recorded for broadcast on the Armed Forces Radio Network, often featured all-girl groups.\n\nOklahoma City\nHot Springs, Arkansas\nSaint Louis\nBirmingham, Alabama\nOhio\nMemphis\nDenver\nKansas City\nMiami\nOmaha\nMilwaukee\nTexas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArkansas\nCalifornia\nColorado\nIllinois\nIowa\nMinnesota \nMissouri\nNebraska\nNew York\nOklahoma\nOregon\nSouth Dakota\nTexas\nVirginia\n\n† Owned by Carl Fox until December 16, 1945, when he sold the Surf in Clear Lake, Iowa, The Prom in St. Paul, Minnesota, and The Terp in Austin, Minnesota, to William Karzas for $1.5 million.

Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt, gathering material previously published in three volumes as \"The Incomplete Enchanter\" (1941), \"The Castle of Iron\" (1950), and \"Wall of Serpents\" (1960), and represents an expansion of the earlier omnibus \"The Compleat Enchanter\", which contained only the material in the first two volumes. The expanded version also differs from the previous omnibus by omitting its afterword, de Camp's essay \"Fletcher and I\". The omnibus is the first edition of the authors' Harold Shea series to be complete in one volume. It has appeared under three different titles. It was first published in the UK in paperback by Sphere Books in 1988 under the title \"The Intrepid Enchanter\" and with a foreword by Catherine Crook de Camp. The first US edition appeared under the title \"The Complete Compleat Enchanter\", and replaces the foreword with a preface by David Drake. That edition was published by Baen Books in 1989, and has been reprinted a number of times since. Orion Books published an edition in the UK under the title \"The Compleat Enchanter\" in 2000 as volume 10 of their Fantasy Masterworks series. The stories in the collection were originally published in magazine form in the May 1940, August 1940 and April 1941 issues of \"Unknown\", the June 1953 issue of \"Beyond Fantasy\", and the October 1954 issue of \"Fantasy\".\n\nThe Harold Shea stories are parallel world tales in which universes where magic works coexist with our own, and in which those based on the mythologies, legends, and literary fantasies of our world and can be reached by aligning one's mind to them by a system of symbolic logic. Psychologist Harold Shea and his colleagues Reed Chalmers, Walter Bayard and Vaclav Polacek (Votsy), travel to several such worlds, joined in the course of their adventures by Belphebe and Florimel of Faerie, who become the wives of Shea and Chalmers, and Pete Brodsky, a policeman who is accidentally swept up into the chaos. The five stories collected in \"The Complete Compleat Enchanter\" explore the worlds of Norse mythology in \"The Roaring Trumpet\", Edmund Spenser's \"The Faerie Queene\" in \"The Mathematics of Magic\", Ludovico Ariosto's \"Orlando Furioso\" (with a brief stop in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"Kubla Khan\") in \"The Castle of Iron\", the \"Kalevala\" in \"The Wall of Serpents\", and Irish mythology in \"The Green Magician\".\n\n\nFollowing publication of \"The Complete Compleat Enchanter\", the Harold Shea series was continued by de Camp in partnership with Christopher Stasheff and other authors in the anthologies \"The Enchanter Reborn\" and \"The Exotic Enchanter\".\n\n"}

{"id": "21754296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21754296", "title": "The Ghost Writer (film)", "text": "The Ghost Writer (film)\n\nThe Ghost Writer (released as The Ghost in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is a 2010 Franco-German-British political thriller film directed by Roman Polanski. The film is an adaptation of a Robert Harris novel, \"The Ghost\", with the screenplay written by Polanski and Harris. It stars Ewan McGregor, Pierce Brosnan, Kim Cattrall and Olivia Williams.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success and won numerous cinematic awards including Best Director for Polanski at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival and also at the 23rd European Film Awards in 2010.\n\nA British ghostwriter (Ewan McGregor) is hired by the publishing firm Rhinehart, Inc., to complete the autobiography of former Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan). His predecessor and Lang's aide, Mike McAra, has recently died in an apparent drowning accident. The writer travels to Old Haven on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, where Lang and his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) are staying, along with Lang's personal assistant (and implied mistress), Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall). Amelia forbids the writer from taking McAra's manuscript outside, emphasising that it is a security risk.\n\nShortly after the writer's arrival, former Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart (Robert Pugh) accuses Lang of authorising the illegal seizure of suspected terrorists and handing them over for torture by the CIA, a possible war crime. Lang faces prosecution by the International Criminal Court unless he stays in the US (or one of the few other countries that does not recognise the court's jurisdiction). While Lang is in Washington, the writer finds items in McAra's room suggesting he might have stumbled across a dark secret. Among them is an envelope containing photographs and a phone number the writer discovers is Rycart's.\n\nDuring a bike ride, the writer encounters an old man (Eli Wallach) who tells him the current couldn't have taken McAra's body from the ferry where he disappeared to the beach where it was discovered. He also reveals a neighbour saw flashlights on the beach the night McAra died, but later fell down the stairs and went into a coma. Later, Ruth admits to the writer Lang had never been very political, and until recently always took her advice. When he tells her the old man's story, she suddenly rushes out into the rainy night to \"clear her head.\" Upon returning, she reveals Lang and McAra had argued the night before the latter's death, and the ghost writer and Ruth have a one night stand while Adam is away.\n\nThe next morning, the writer takes the BMW X5 McAra used on his last journey. Unable to cancel the pre-programmed directions on the car's sat-nav, he decides to follow them. He arrives in Belmont at the home of Professor Paul Emmett (Tom Wilkinson). Emmett denies anything more than a cursory acquaintance with Lang, despite the writer showing him two pictures of the pair among photographs found in McAra's possessions, as well as another on the wall of Emmett's study. When the writer tells Emmett the sat-nav proves McAra visited him the night he died, Emmett denies meeting McAra and becomes evasive. The writer leaves, and successfully eludes a car that is pursuing him. He boards the ferry back to Martha's Vineyard, but when he sees the pursuit car drive aboard, he flees the boat at the last moment and checks into a small motel by the ferry dock.\n\nWith no one else to turn to, the writer redials Rycart's number, asking for help. While waiting, the writer does research on Emmett and links his think tank to a military contractor. He also finds leads connecting Emmett to the CIA. When Rycart arrives, he reveals McAra gave him documents linking Lang to so-called \"torture flights,\" where terrorist suspects were placed on private jets owned by Emmett's company, to be tortured while airborne.\n\nRycart further claims that McAra found new evidence, which he wrote about in the \"beginning\" of the manuscript. The men cannot, however, find anything in the early pages. The writer discusses Emmett's relationship with Lang, while Rycart recounts how Lang's decisions as Prime Minister uniformly benefited US interests. When the writer is summoned to accompany Lang on his return flight by private jet, he confronts Lang and accuses him of being a CIA agent recruited by Emmett. Lang derides his suggestions.\n\nUpon leaving the aircraft, Lang is assassinated by a British anti-war protester, who is in turn shot by Lang's bodyguards. Nevertheless, the writer is asked to complete the book for posthumous publication, as in light of Lang's death it will be a certain best-seller. Amelia invites him to the book's launch party in London, where she unwittingly tells him the Americans tightened access to the book, as the \"beginnings\" contained evidence threatening national security. She also tells him Emmett, who is in attendance, was Ruth's tutor when she was a Fulbright scholar at Harvard.\n\nThe writer realizes the clues were hidden in the original manuscript in the opening words of each paragraph, and discovers the message: \"Lang's wife Ruth was recruited as a CIA agent by Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University.\" He concludes Ruth shaped Lang's every political decision to benefit the USA under direction from the CIA.\n\nThe writer passes a note to Ruth revealing his discovery. She unfolds the note, and is devastated. When she sees the writer raising a glass, she is kept from following him by Emmett and other assistants. As the writer leaves the party he attempts to take a taxi, without success. As he crosses the street off-camera, a car accelerates in his direction to an impending collision. As witnesses react in horror, the pages containing McAra's manuscript are blowing in the wind, leaving the writer's fate unconfirmed.\n\n\nPierce Brosnan plays the character of Adam Lang, who has echoes of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The character is linked to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the war on terror and the special relationship with the United States. The author of the book on which the film is based has said he was inspired at least in part by anger at Mr Blair's policies, and calls for him to face war crimes trials.\n\nRobert Pugh, who portrayed the British Foreign Secretary, Richard Rycart, and Mo Asumang, who played the US Secretary of State, both physically resemble their real-life counterparts, Robin Cook and Condoleezza Rice. Like the fictional Rycart, Cook had foreign policy differences with the British Prime Minister. The old man living on Martha's Vineyard is a reference to Robert McNamara. Hatherton Corporation alludes to real-life Halliburton.\n\nPolanski had originally teamed with Robert Harris for a film of Harris's novel \"Pompeii\", but the project was cancelled because of the looming actors' strike that autumn.\n\nPolanski and Harris then turned to Harris' current best seller, \"The Ghost\". They co-wrote a script and in November 2007, just after the book's release, Polanski announced filming for autumn 2008. In June 2008, Nicolas Cage, Pierce Brosnan, Tilda Swinton, and Kim Cattrall were announced as the stars. Production was then postponed by a number of months, with Ewan McGregor and Olivia Williams replacing Cage and Swinton, respectively, as a result.\n\nThe film finally began production in February 2009 in Germany, at the Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam. Germany stood in for London and Martha's Vineyard due to Polanski's inability to legally travel to those places, as Polanski had fled the U.S. in 1978 after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl. The majority of exteriors, set on Martha's Vineyard, were shot on the island of Sylt in the North Sea, and on the ferry MS \"SyltExpress\". The exterior set of the house where much of the film takes place, however, was built on the island of Usedom, in the Baltic Sea. Exteriors and interiors set at a publishing house in London were shot at Charlottenstrasse 47 in downtown Berlin (Mitte), while Strausberg Airport near Berlin stood in for the Vineyard airport. A few brief exterior shots for driving scenes were shot by a second unit in Massachusetts, without Polanski or the actors.\n\nOn his way to the Zurich Film Festival, Polanski was arrested by Swiss police in September 2009 at the request of the US and held for extradition on a 1978 arrest warrant. Due to Polanski's arrest, post-production was briefly put on hold, but he resumed and completed work from house arrest at his Swiss villa. He was unable to participate in the film's world premiere at the Berlinale festival on 12 February 2010.\n\nThe film premièred at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival on 12 February 2010, and was widely released throughout much of Europe during the following four weeks. It went on general release in the US on 19 March 2010 and in the UK on 16 April 2010.\n\nThe film has received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 83% of critics gave positive reviews based on a sample of 196 reviews with an average rating of 7.4/10. Its consensus notes that, \"While it may lack the revelatory punch of Polanski's finest films, \"Ghost Writer\" benefits from stylish direction, a tense screenplay, and a strong central performance from Ewan McGregor.\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, gave the film an average rating of 77% based on 35 reviews. For Andrew Sarris the film \"constitutes a miracle of artistic and psychological resilience.\" Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and declared: \"This movie is the work of a man who knows how to direct a thriller.\"\n\nJournalist-blogger William Bradley has dubbed it \"one of the best films I've seen in recent years\" in a review for \"The Huffington Post\" that dealt with the film's artistic and political dimensions. \"The Guardian\" said: \"Roman Polanski's deft take on Robert Harris's political thriller is the director's most purely enjoyable film for years.\" Writing for \"LAS Magazine\", Theon Weber gave the film a 6.8 (of 10) rating and called it \"a thriller with topical ambitions; it takes place in a jittery, bomb-fearing Britain and America, often in airports or official buildings, where the weary rituals of security screenings refuse to let the characters or the audience relax.\"\n\nHowever, John Rentoul from the UK's \"The Independent\", who describes himself as an \"ultra Blairite with a slavish admiration for Tony\", and John Rosenthal, from the conservative Pajamas Media, both denounced the film because it was made with financial support from the German government. Rentoul also launched a scathing attack on Polanski describing the winner of Berlin's Silver Bear as \"propaganda\" and a \"Blair hating movie\". Still, what the critics did not explain was that although the production company, Elfte Babelsberg Film GmbH, received €3.5 million from the German state, any major film production within Germany is entitled to apply for financial assistance from the . Since the assistance is considered a grant, there is no requirement that it be repaid. As a result of this funding policy, numerous English-language films have been at least partially shot in Germany over the last two decades, among them \"The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum, Aeon Flux, Valkyrie, The Pianist, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Constant Gardener, Unknown, Inglourious Basterds, and Anonymous\".\n\nThe movie has won numerous awards, particularly for Roman Polanski as director, Ewan McGregor in the lead role, and Olivia Williams as Ruth Lang.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4282451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4282451", "title": "The Voyage of Life", "text": "The Voyage of Life\n\nThe Voyage of Life is a series of paintings created by Thomas Cole in 1842, representing an allegory of the four stages of human life: childhood, youth, manhood, and old age. The paintings depict a voyager who travels in a boat on a river through the mid-19th-century American wilderness. In each painting the voyager rides the boat on the River of Life accompanied by a guardian angel. The landscape, each reflecting one of the four seasons of the year, plays a major role in conveying the story. With each installment the boat's direction of travel is reversed from the previous picture. In childhood, the infant glides from a dark cave into a rich, green landscape. As a youth, the boy takes control of the boat and aims for a shining castle in the sky. In manhood, the adult relies on prayer and religious faith to sustain him through rough waters and a threatening landscape. Finally, the man becomes old and the angel guides him to heaven across the waters of eternity.\n\nThomas Cole is regarded as the founder of the Hudson River School, an American art movement that flourished in the mid-19th century and was concerned with the realistic and detailed portrayal of nature but with a strong influence from Romanticism. This group of American landscape painters worked between about 1825 and 1870 and shared a sense of national pride as well as an interest in celebrating the unique natural beauty found in the United States. The wild, untamed nature found in America was viewed as its special character; Europe had ancient ruins, but America had the uncharted wilderness. As Cole's friend William Cullen Bryant sermonized in verse, so Cole sermonized in paint. Both men saw nature as God's work and as a refuge from the ugly materialism of cities. Cole clearly intended \"The Voyage of Life\" to be a didactic, moralizing series of paintings using the landscape as an allegory for religious faith.\n\nUnlike Cole's first major series, \"The Course of Empire\", which focused on the stages of civilization as a whole, \"The Voyage of Life\" series is a more personal, Christian allegory that interprets visually the journey of man through four stages of life: infancy, youth, manhood and old age. Done on commission, the finished works generated a disagreement with the owner about a public exhibition. In 1842, when Cole was in Rome, he did a second set of the series which on his return to America was shown to acclaim. The first set is at the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in Utica, New York, and the second set is at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the first painting, \"Childhood\", all the important story elements of the series are introduced: the voyager, the angel, the river, and the expressive landscape. An infant is safely ensconced in a boat guided by an angel. The landscape is lush; everything is calm and basking in warm sunshine, reflecting the innocence and joy of childhood. The boat glides out of a dark, craggy cave which Cole himself described as \"emblematic of our earthly origin, and the mysterious Past.\" The river is smooth and narrow, symbolizing the sheltered experience of childhood. The figurehead on the prow holds an hourglass representing time.\n\nThe second painting, \"Youth\", shows the same rich, green landscape, but here the view widens as does the voyager's experience. Now the youth grabs the tiller firmly as the angel watches and waves from the shore, allowing him to take control. The boy's enthusiasm and energy is evident in his forward-thrusting pose and billowing clothes. In the distance, a ghostly castle hovers in the sky, a white and shimmering beacon that represents the ambitions and dreams of man.\nTo the youth, the calm river seems to lead straight to the castle, but at the far right of the painting one can just glimpse the river as it becomes rough, choppy, and full of rocks. Cole comments on the landscape and the youth's ambitions: \"The scenery of the picture—its clear stream, its lofty trees, its towering mountains, its unbounded distance, and transparent atmosphere—figure forth the romantic beauty of youthful imaginings, when the mind elevates the Mean and Common into the Magnificent, before experience teaches what is the Real.\"\n\nCole's renowned four-part series traces the journey of an archetypal hero along the \"River of Life.\" Confidently assuming control of his destiny and oblivious to the dangers that await him, the voyager boldly strives to reach an aerial castle, emblematic of the daydreams of \"Youth\" and its aspirations for glory and fame. As the traveler approaches his goal, the ever more turbulent stream deviates from its course and relentlessly carries him toward the next picture in the series, where nature's fury, evil demons, and self-doubt will threaten his very existence. Only prayer, Cole suggests, can save the voyager from a dark and tragic fate.\n\nFrom the innocence of childhood, to the flush of youthful overconfidence, through the trials and tribulations of middle age, to the hero's triumphant salvation, \"The Voyage of Life\" seems intrinsically linked to the Christian doctrine of death and resurrection. Cole's intrepid voyager also may be read as a personification of America, itself at an adolescent stage of development. The artist may have been issuing a dire warning to those caught up in the feverish quest for Manifest Destiny: that unbridled westward expansion and industrialization would have tragic consequences for both man and the land itself.\n\nThe final painting, \"Old Age\", is an image of death. The man has grown old; he has survived the trials of life. The waters have calmed; the river flows into the waters of eternity. The figurehead and hourglass are missing from the battered boat; the withered old voyager has reached the end of earthly time. In the distance, angels are descending from heaven, while the guardian angel hovers close, gesturing toward the others. The man is once again joyous with the knowledge that faith has sustained him through life. The landscape is practically gone, just a few rough rocks represent the edge of the earthly world, and dark water stretches onward. Cole describes the scene: \"The chains of corporeal existence are falling away; and already the mind has glimpses of Immortal Life.\"\n\n\"The Voyage of Life\" was well received by critics and the public; the United States was experiencing the religious revival sometimes known as the Second Great Awakening. The four paintings were converted to engravings by James Smillie (1807–85) after Cole's death and the engravings widely distributed in time for the Third Great Awakening, giving the series the prestige and popular acclaim it retains today.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40305899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40305899", "title": "Ziva David captivity storyline", "text": "Ziva David captivity storyline\n\nThe Ziva David captivity storyline refers to a series of episodes from the American police procedural drama \"NCIS\" surrounding the imprisonment of protagonist Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) in a Somali terrorist training camp and its aftermath. Originally created by then-executive producer Shane Brennan, the story arc first aired in 2009 during the sixth season of the show and continued into the seventh season. Episodes followed the events that originally led to Ziva's being taken hostage by an Islamic terrorist, the collapse of her relationship with the NCIS team, her captivity and eventual rescue, and the ramifications.\n\nElements of prisoner abuse and torture were used for the storyline, though most of the violence perpetrated against the character takes place off screen; producers avoided depicting explicit torture scenes like those commonly associated with the TV series \"24\".\n\nThe portrayal of Ziva's divided loyalties to the United States and Israel during this period attracted attention from several Jewish critics and columnists, who discussed its implications. Specifically, the actions of Ziva's father, Eli David (Michael Nouri), drew widespread debate, and his seeming nonchalant attitude towards his daughter's abuse garnered much criticism for the character. Within the series, it led to her decision to resign from Mossad and apply to become an NCIS agent and an American citizen.\n\nThe character of Ziva David was introduced by series creator Donald P. Bellisario in 2005 during the third season of \"NCIS\", which follows a team of government agents who work for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Chilean-American actress Cote de Pablo was cast to portray the character, who underwent a number of revisions before ultimately being scripted as an Israeli Mossad officer assigned as a liaison to the NCIS team. She is portrayed as having a vibrant personality despite her background as an assassin and being \"an extremely skilled interrogator, nearly impossible to break\".\nInitially rejected by most of the other characters, she is eventually accepted as a member of the NCIS team and as a surrogate daughter figure to team leader Gibbs (Mark Harmon). She also serves as a foil for Special Agent Tony DiNozzo, a former Baltimore homicide cop and \"wannabe playboy\" played by Michael Weatherly. Early on, producers began to toy with the idea of pairing them romantically but avoided going through with the relationship by dealing them a number of obstacles, namely difficult circumstances and other love interests.\n\nZiva's upbringing is alluded in her first few seasons. She is depicted as having a somewhat troubled background with a difficult family history. Her younger sister was killed in a terrorist attack against Israel, and her half-brother Ari Haswari became a Hamas terrorist; she eventually kills him onscreen to prevent him from killing Gibbs. Before de Pablo's first appearance, Ari's father—and thus Ziva's as well—is referred to as \"Doctor Benjamin Weinstein\" before \"the series writing staff later Hebraized Dr. Weinstein's name to Eli David\".\n\nShane Brennan replaced Bellisario as executive producer in 2007, and in the sixth season premiere, he simultaneously introduced Ziva's father, Mossad Director Eli David (Michael Nouri), and Mossad Officer Michael Rivkin (Merik Tadros). Their appearances catalyzed the events that lead to Ziva being taken hostage later in the season.\n\n\"NCIS\" writers introduced Merik Tadros' character, Mossad Officer Michael Rivkin, as a potential love interest for Ziva in the sixth season premiere, \"Last Man Standing\". After initial trepidation over how to move forward with the character, and an aborted idea of revising him as a relative of Ziva, executive producer Shane Brennan decided to script what he considered to be a love triangle between Ziva, Tony, and Rivkin for the latter half of the season. The story arc, which was planned to end in a \"tragic\" fashion, was set to cover the last four episodes of the year.\n\nBrennan began the arc by writing the two-part episode \"Legend\" which served as a backdoor pilot episode for the spin-off series, \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" featuring the hunt for a terrorist; when Special Agents Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) and Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) fly to Los Angeles to work with the NCIS Office of Special Projects — Los Angeles team to solve the murder of a marine, they discover that the killing is linked to members of a sleeper cell. Rivkin becomes involved and, rather than working with NCIS to apprehend the terrorists, kills the suspects, frustrating the other agents.\n\nBack in Washington D.C., Tony starts to question Ziva's loyalty when she defends Rivkin's actions, and it is made evident that she is in a relationship with the latter in the closing moments of Part II as the two are seen in bed together.\n\nThe nature of Ziva's romance with Rivkin became a subject of debate among viewers, and some speculated that it could have been arranged by her father against her will. Tadros opined that \"Rivkin loves Ziva\" regardless of the circumstances and acted accordingly from that perspective. Despite this, the relationship becomes more ambiguous in the last two episodes of the season as a security breach at the SECNAV's residence leads to the death of an ICE agent and evidence points to Rivkin. Tony confronts a drunken Rivkin, resulting in a vicious brawl between them that culminates with Tony being forced to shoot Rivkin in self-defense when Rivkin attempts to stab Tony with a piece of glass. Despite Ziva's efforts, Rivkin ultimately succumbs to his wounds and dies.\n\nThe killing, and the ensuing events, generated some controversy among viewers. On screen, it causes a rift between Tony and Ziva, as well as a violent confrontation between the two in the season finale. Cote de Pablo described Tony's actions as \"almost unforgivable\" from her character's perspective despite their being in self-defense and stated, \"I think sometimes when people make mistakes, they can be impulsive and judge someone on one particular thing. Ziva isn't overreacting—Tony did kill someone who was a big part of her life—but, at the time, she couldn't see clearly.\"\n\nNCIS Director Leon Vance (Rocky Carroll) agrees to a request from Eli and brings the involved parties to Israel. Eli interrogates Tony and accuses him of killing Rivkin out of jealously, a motivation that Michael Weatherly voiced to have been plausible. Tony, in turn, accuses him of ordering Rivkin to seduce Ziva in order to keep an eye on her, which he does not deny. Under pressure from her father, Ziva stays in Israel and returns to the Mossad as a full-time operative, taking Rivkin's place on a mission to assassinate Saleem Ulman (Omid Abtahi), the leader of a terrorist training camp in Somalia which also sees her leaving NCIS as well and seeing the Major Case Response Team being reduced to three active members: Gibbs, DiNozzo and McGee. Gibbs confronts Vance about the turn of events, insisting that he still trusts Ziva because of her choice to save him by killing her brother four years earlier. In response, Vance claims that she had only done so because her father had ordered to. The final moments of the episode show her to have been taken hostage and tortured by Saleem.\n\nThe search for and rescue of Ziva was written into the seventh season premiere, but rather than show her in captivity, the writers decided to script the episode from Tony's point of view. This allowed them to shock the audience by opening the episode with Tony strapped to the interrogation chair, rather than Ziva, as well as keep viewers wondering about Ziva's fate. Brennan relayed, \"You'll think you know what's going on, but then you'll go, 'Am I seeing things? What just happened?'\" Within the episode, Tony, under the influence of truth serum, recounts to Saleem the events that occurred during the four months since Ziva's disappearance: the team at first attempted to replace Ziva without success. After becoming concerned about her continued lack of communication, they hacked into Mossad's database and learned that she had been put on the assignment to find and kill Saleem. Gibbs then informed them that the \"Damocles\", the ship the Mossad team had taken, had sunk in a storm and that there were no survivors. Tony subsequently became despondent for some time until deciding that they needed to avenge Ziva's death by killing Saleem. This led to him and McGee intentionally being taken captive and interrogated upon locating the camp through the shipment of the fictional drink, \"Caf-Pow!\". In present day, he concludes that Ziva is \"not replaceable\".\nAn infuriated Saleem demands the locations and identities of all other NCIS operatives in the area, threatening to execute a hostage if they refuse to cooperate. To Tony's shock and relief, Saleem brings a bound Ziva into the cell, who is very much alive. Gibbs kills Saleem before he can harm either captive, and the camp is raided by Navy SEALs. In the closing moments of the episode, Ziva returns to NCIS with the team and is welcomed back in the office.\n\nSubsequent episodes center on her recovery and integration back into the team. The other characters are at first uncertain of her allegiances, and Ziva herself suffers from the trauma of what was done to her during captivity. \"Things are different for her with everyone,\" de Pablo explained. \"When she returns, her loyalty is questioned - but, in this season, it will become very clear that she sees NCIS as her family and that her loyalty is really with this family, as opposed to her blood family in Israel.\" Producers used the storyline as an opportunity for Ziva to resign from Mossad and apply to become a full-time NCIS agent and American citizen, solidifying her presence at the agency. She manages to repair her relationship with Tony, and when confronted she assures Gibbs that she had in fact killed Ari to save his life. However, the latter continues to distance himself emotionally from her.\n\nBrennan had the fourth episode of the season, \"Good Cop, Bad Cop\", scripted to in effect \"[fill] in the blanks\" left between the season finale and premiere. In it, the team discovers that Damocles did not sink in a storm but rather was abandoned after a shootout resulted in the entire crew and one member of the Mossad team being killed. Flashbacks are threaded through the episode, mostly set on the \"Damocles\", showing that Ziva had befriended a U.S. Marine deserter-turned-freelance-agent on board who was among those killed and that Eli later ordered her to continue on the mission despite the risks making her death almost inevitable. Rather than risk the remaining members of her team being killed, as they were both injured in the shooting, she opted to continue alone and as a result was taken hostage.\n\nShe becomes a suspect for the marine's death when Eli, in an attempt to prevent her from leaving Mossad, orders her former team leader, Malachi Ben Gidon, who had been on the mission with her, to accuse her of being responsible for the killing. After she is proven innocent, Gibbs angrily states that Ziva is \"off limits\" to Eli. They reconcile, with Ziva relaying the rest of what happened up to being taken captive. Gibbs then whispers something in her ear and kisses her forehead as she breaks down crying.\n\nMark Harmon explained that Gibbs, despite being \"a huge fan of hers\" and the character who \"perhaps cares the most\" about Ziva, had to be wary of her in the beginning due to the question of loyalty. He improvised the final moments of the characters' reconciliation, and what Gibbs whispered to her became a subject of discussion among viewers. Likewise, de Pablo's reaction to it was not scripted either. Harmon declined to divulge what was said, stating, \"That's our secret.\" These events propelled the idea of Gibbs as a surrogate father figure to Ziva, marking the first time it was verbally acknowledged within the series.\n\nFollowing \"Good Cop, Bad Cop\", Ziva's attempts to gain American citizenship became the main subplot while her captivity is only mentioned in passing throughout the rest of Season 7 and into Season 8. To assure the audience that the seriousness of the character's trauma had not been overlooked, a February episode had her briefly discuss the experience with Tony. \"In true NCIS fashion, it's never quite addressed...\" de Pablo said. \"The way it was written was sort of glazed over, but it was so there. We're constantly being bombarded with new information, or else the characters just wouldn't grow or go anywhere.\" Ziva is uncomfortable when Tony recommends picking the lock of a warehouse to search it without a warrant, reasoning that doing so would help them solve the case more quickly. She explains that when she was in Somalia, Saleem would regularly attempt to justify his crimes by claiming that he committed them to protect his way of life.\n\nAfterwards, the subject is alluded to during specific cases, such as when the team deals with a rape victim at the end of Season 7 and an abused wife in the middle of Season 8. In the latter case, Head Medical Examiner Ducky Mallard (David McCallum) suggests that Gibbs have Ziva be the one to confront the woman, saying, \"Agent David has been through things you and I can't even imagine, and she knows what it's like to be controlled.\" Michael Nouri was brought back to guest star as Eli David during the eighth season, and the consequences of his actions are addressed. Ziva is able to forgive him somewhat, and he tries to reach a full reconciliation in Season 10's \"Shabbat Shalom\". However, he is killed in a targeted shooting before he is able to make peace with his daughter, greatly devastating Ziva and prompting her to embark on a campaign of revenge against the man responsible: Ilan Bodnar.\n\nZiva's ordeal in Somalia included being tortured by Saleem and his men, but the producers avoided depicting it graphically. Shane Brennan wrote a cliffhanger for the season finale that briefly shows her in the aftermath of an evidently brutal interrogation; in it, she is limp and tied to a chair, bloody and bruised. Makeup specialists were able to use a significant amount of cosmetics on de Pablo to make her face \"nearly unrecognizable\". The torturer, later identified as Saleem, casually returns to her cell, rips off her Star of David pendant, and demands that she tell him what she knows about NCIS. She does not appear again until her rescue in the Season 7 premiere, where she is hooded, \"ready to die\", and unable to walk on her own.\n\nTony and McGee are both later captured by Saleem on purpose as part of the operation to take down the terrorist prison camp. They suffer an initial beating on being taken hostage, but neither are shown being subjected to torture for information. As the entire premiere is set during Tony's interrogation, \"NCIS\" writers opted to script Saleem as injecting Tony with truth serum as a means of obtaining information from him. Glue, which tightens the skin, was put on the actors' lips to effectively make all three characters look sunburned and dehydrated.\n\nThe specifics of Ziva's abuse are not discussed following her rescue, and, within the series, the other characters only refer to it vaguely. For example, Vance tells Gibbs that \"Saleem's men put a world of hurt on her\" and Ducky states that \"she went through far more than [they] originally suspected\". Though an episode was filmed to clear some of the questions by showing the events that led up to her captivity, it did not delve into her time as a hostage and de Pablo later confirmed that the ambiguity of what had happened during those four months was intentional. Viewers began to speculate that Ziva had been raped while in captivity and questioned whether the plot was too dark for a primetime drama to explore in depth. De Pablo did not comment on the subject of her character's ordeal except to affirm that Saleem and his men did \"bad things\" to Ziva and to suggest that she had suppressed her feelings regarding the trauma in its aftermath.\n\nWhen first introduced to the series, Ziva is \"a cocky, young kid who thinks she knows it all and thinks that nothing can really touch her [or] beat her\". She maintains this demeanor over the next several seasons despite some of the hardships she endures, such as killing her brother and seeing a love interest die from radiation poisoning. During the summer prior to the seventh season, \"NCIS\" producers divulged that Ziva would be \"a changed woman\" after her experiences in Somalia. This manifests in her being written as a softer, more subdued character, and, in the words of Cote de Pablo, \"more inclined to listen before acting out\".\n\nWhile it has been suggested that these aspects made her more likeable, the changes to her personality were not universally welcomed, and Jewish critics expressed concern about the choice to \"Americanize\" the only Israeli regular on Western television. De Pablo herself preferred the more wild and reckless version of Ziva and eventually began to request that she be allowed to return to some of her pre-Somalia behavior. Gary Glasberg, who took over as executive producer for Shane Brennan in 2011, gave her that opportunity in the latter half of the tenth season, which focused on Ziva's attempts to get revenge for her father's assassination.\n\nThe actions of Eli David, both before and after Ziva's captivity, and the extent of their reflection on Israel and Mossad as a whole became a controversial matter during the course of the storyline. On a moral level, viewers were unnerved by the idea of him instructing Michael Rivkin, a Mossad officer, to engage in a sexual relationship with his daughter \"to exploit [her] liaison position with NCIS, and perhaps to breed him a grandchild\". The situation was made more sordid when the new season revealed that Eli had ordered her to continue on her assignment, even after it became clear that her chances of survival were slim; to make matters worse, he failed to rescue his daughter after she had been taken captive by the Somalian terrorists. Rabbi Elliot B. Gertel wrote:\n\nHarvard academic Eitan Kensky also weighed in on the matter:\n\nCote de Pablo, who has been to Israel, considered Eli to be a sympathetic character despite his transgressions, explaining, \"These characters are able to justify [their actions] because they come from a country that's at war.\" However, she also considered Ziva's anger to be justifiable as well, as her father \"[sent] her away on, basically, what I would call a suicide mission\". Within the series, Ziva is able to partially reconcile with Eli and reach an \"unspoken forgiveness\" for him in the eighth season, but the show's writers did not begin to redeem his character until shortly before his death in the tenth season episode \"Shabbat Shalom\".\n\nDuring the first few seasons, storylines related to Israel focus on the \"peculiar arrangement\" between the agencies \"in which the brilliant daughter of the head of Mossad (Ziva David) has been embedded in the American NCIS\". For example, the Season 4 premiere involves a plot surrounding Iranian agents framing Ziva, and by extension Israel, for the murder of two FBI agents and a terrorist in their custody. Situations are made more complicated due to her being \"stigmatized as the (half) sister of a Hamas terrorist killer\". In general, the show avoids creating black-and-white portrayals of the Israeli people; Mossad agents are depicted as effective with justified motivations, but the series has introduced \"bad\" Israelis, most prominently a rogue Mossad officer who participates in the framing of Ziva in Season 4. Ziva herself is a sympathetic figure who is \"unashamedly Jewish\" and proud of being Israeli, though she is often more ruthless than her colleagues at NCIS.\n\nThe captivity storylines took a different route by using the characters of Ziva and Michael Rivkin to symbolize the \"two Israels American policy makers have faced over the years\". Ziva is \"the cooperative and quiet Israeli, who has the technical and personal skills to be of enormous assistance in achieving the mission\" while Rivkin is \"bright and pro-American, but in this case tough, aggressive, thinks he knows what is best for the United States better than the Americans, is sly and wily, and he doesn't heed the advice of his American counterparts\". Both are received differently by the American agents—Ziva is respected and trusted by her colleagues; Rivkin is an object of suspicion. Steven L. Spiegel, Director of the Center for Middle East Development and Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), drew parallels between their interactions with their American counterparts and those of prominent Israeli politicians. Ziva, he reasoned, could be likened to Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, or Ehud Olmert in that she is able to agree with the American agencies on a more basic, fundamental level. Rivkin, he continued, was more like Yitzhak Shamir.\n\n\"NCIS\" writers continued to present the Israeli personalities as capable and justified, though Spiegel suggested that they \"[were] too affected by their tragic past\".\n\nThe first four of the arc's eight episodes average between 16.20 and 16.72 million viewers while the last four all maintained over 20 million following their broadcast. Despite the controversial aspects, the storyline received generally positive reviews, with it being called \"harrowing\" and \"fantastic\". Response for \"Truth or Consequences\", the seventh season premiere, was particularly favorable, and it was later listed among BuddyTV's \"10 Best [Tony and Ziva] episodes\". Allison Waldman from AOL summarized the execution of the characters' search for and rescue of Ziva:\n\nViewers disliked the character of Michael Rivkin, partly due to an attachment to the \"will they/won't they\" relationship between Tony and Ziva. Zap2it's Brandon Millman referred to the three of them as \"the love triangle of death\".\n\nA portion of the audience criticized the writers for not directly confronting what Ziva had endured in captivity, believing that in doing so they had not properly addressed her trauma. When the Season 8 episode focusing on domestic abuse aired, Steve Marsi from \"TV Fanatic\" commented, \"What was most intriguing about the case was not the evidence or the unfolding mystery but the fact that this powerful woman, a Marine martial arts trainer, was an abuse victim. Sounds like someone we know. Ziva opened up to Georgia about similar abuse she suffered and made some inroads, although this could have been extrapolated upon further. It seemed like a prime opportunity for Ziva's character to shine - relating to a suspect similarly strong, powerful, yet vulnerable - but the plot quickly moved in other directions.\" There were also complaints about the choice to partially rewrite the details of the earlier storyline surrounding Ziva's killing of her brother, which had served as her introduction to the series.\n\nExecutive producer Shane Brennan left \"NCIS\" to focus on its spin-off, \"NCIS: Los Angeles\", in 2011. Two years later, a similar storyline and cliff-hanger featuring the torture of two main characters was used for the fourth season finale. The characters, Sam Hanna (LL Cool J) and Marty Deeks (Eric Christian Olsen), are taken hostage by Isaak Sidorov, a Russian arms dealer who interrogates them for information. Unlike with the original \"NCIS\", Brennan opted to have them tortured onscreen, with Sidorov electrocuting Sam and forcing a dentist drill into Deeks' mouth.\n\nThe choice to include the scene drew criticism; a number of viewers were disturbed by the torture and accused the producers of engaging in gratuitous violence. In response to complaints, Carla Day from \"TV Fanatic\" wrote an article naming several instances in which television shows featured storylines that included torture, among them Ziva's captivity storyline. She concluded that what was shown was \"just enough to get the point across without overdoing it\".\n\n"}
