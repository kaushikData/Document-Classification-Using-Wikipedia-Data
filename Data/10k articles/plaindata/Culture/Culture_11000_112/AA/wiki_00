There are about thirty speakers, from a persecuted section of the community.\n\nAgbirigba is unintelligible to other speakers of Ikwerre, but the rule for its derivation is simple: the consonant \"t\" is added before every CV syllable (or, more accurately, every CV mora). Some speakers add an epenthetic vowel to break up the resulting consonant cluster.\n\nThe addition of the \"t\" results in consonant clusters that do not occur in Ikwerre or other local languages. Some speakers pronounce Agbirigba with the resulting clusters. For speakers to break them up with vowels, the vowels are all high (one of the four vowels ), and match the subsequent vowel in ATR, backness, nasality and tone. \n\nAn NCV sequence becomes NtCV. For example, \"m̀fù\" 'horn' becomes \"ǹtfù\" or \"ǹtùfù\". \n\nThere are some complications to this: if the following vowel is /a/, with no ATR quality for the epenthetic vowel to match, then the epenthetic vowel will be /i/ or /u/ depending on, apparently, whether the following consonant is coronal or velar, and if the tone of the following syllable (whether CV or CVV) is complex (rising or falling), then the first element of that tone will move to the epenthetic vowel.\n\n\nbecomes:\nor \n\nHere all the vowels are ATR, so the epenthetic vowels are /i/ or /u/ depending on whether the following vowel is front (/e/ or /i/) or back (/o/ or /u/).

The amezaiku craft spread beyond the temple during the Edo period, when many forms of street performance flourished in Japan and when its base ingredient, \"mizuame\", became widely available. In Edo it emerged in its present artistic form.\n\nThe candy base is prepared beforehand, using a starchy syrup recipe that requires careful monitoring to ensure proper consistency and appearance. The mixture is kneaded and pulled by hand, and formed into a large ball to be stored until ready to use. At the stall, the candy ball is heated to make it pliable again. The artist puts their hand into the hot mass to pinch up the material necessary; this too is a skill, as the artist must learn to tolerate the painful heat of the medium. The hot candy is quickly rolled and mounted on a stick, then pulled, twisted and clipped into form, usually an animal of some kind and often intricate. Speed is necessary to the art since the sculpture must be completed before the candy cools and hardens again.\n\nOne method formerly used in sculpting amezaiku was blowing into the candy by means of a straw, similar to glass-blowing. This practice was eventually prohibited in Japan as unhygienic, although other means of introducing blown air may be used.\n\n\n"}

Created by writers Grant Morrison and Mark Millar, and artist Ron Wagner, the character had cameos in \"The Flash\" (vol. 2) #138 (June 1998), before appearing in full in \"The Flash\" #141 (September 1998).\n\nThe Black Flash essentially fulfills the same role as Death for those who possess super-speed in the DC Universe, returning the speedster to their power source: the Speed Force. It is reportedly seen before the deaths of Barry Allen and Johnny Quick. Max Mercury, having had several near-death experiences, has also seen the Black Flash.\n\nIt is not clear whether the Black Flash exists because speedsters are simply too fast for traditional Death to capture, or as some sort of bizarre side-effect to their Speed Force connection.\n\nIt came for Wally West to draw back to the Speed Force, but instead took Linda Park. Having seen portents of Wally's death, Max Mercury and Jesse Quick intercepted Wally before reaching the museum where Linda was waiting, with Linda thus being struck by the lightning that was meant to kill Wally. It later returns to try to take Wally again, freezing time except for those who possess a connection to the Speed Force. Max Mercury, Jay Garrick, and Jesse Quick all attempt to assist Wally by distracting the Black Flash; Wally finally defeats the Black Flash by racing the creature to the end of time, to a point where Death would have no meaning, causing the creature to dissipate.\n\nThe Black Flash appears to Bart Allen when the Flash loses his powers while battling the Rogues at the Getty Center. Despite a clash with Inertia (another possible candidate for the Black Flash), Bart is killed shortly thereafter by the panicked Rogues when it appears Bart would win, even without powers.\n\nMost recently, the Black Flash is revealed to represent the dark aspect of the Speed Force, which is responsible for the empowerment of Wally's children. His connection to death is limited to those connected to the Speed Force. While an issue of \"Captain Atom\" suggests Death of the Endless, the Black Racer, and Nekron are all aspects of the same force, Neil Gaiman (creator of Death of the Endless) disagrees with this idea, stating that his creation is the ultimate personification of Death.\n\nDuring the \"Final Crisis\", Wally theorizes that the Black Racer pursuing himself and Barry is in fact the Black Flash.\n\nA charred corpse, appearing to be the Black Flash, was found in Iowa by two boys in \"\".\n\nLater when discovering the body, Barry Allen is transformed into the next Black Flash, but the state is reversed.

{"id": "1353717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1353717", "title": "Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow", "text": "Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow\n\nCastlevania: Dawn of Sorrow is an action-adventure game developed and published by Konami. It is part of Konami's \"Castlevania\" video game series and the first \"Castlevania\" game released on the Nintendo DS. The game is the sequel to \"\" and incorporates many elements from its predecessor. \"Dawn of Sorrow\" was commercially successful. It sold more than 15,000 units in its first week in Japan and 164,000 units in the United States during the three months after its initial release.\n\n\"Dawn of Sorrow\" continues the story of \"Aria of Sorrow\". Dracula has been completely defeated, and his powers assumed by his reincarnation, Soma Cruz. With the help of his allies, Soma avoids becoming the new dark lord. A cult forms to bring forth a new dark lord by killing Soma. Soma and his allies move to ensure a new dark lord is not created.\n\n\"Dawn of Sorrow\" incorporates many features from earlier \"Castlevania\" games: the combination of elements from platform games and role-playing video games, the \"Tactical Soul\" system featured in \"Aria of Sorrow\" and a dark, gothic atmosphere. \"Dawn of Sorrow\" also introduces new gameplay elements, like the \"Magic Seal\" system, which requires the use of the DS stylus to draw a pattern to defeat powerful enemies, a distinctive anime character design, and a multiplayer mode, where two players compete for fastest times on a prerendered level. The game received high scores from many video game publications, and was considered one of the best games on the Nintendo DS for 2005. The game was re-released in Japan on June 29, 2006, and later in North America during 2007 as part of the \"Konami the Best\" line.\n\nDuring the game, the player controls the onscreen character from a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series, and most role-playing games, characters level up each time they earn a set number of experience points from defeating enemies; each level gained increases the character's statistics, thus improving their performance in battle. Statistic examples include hit points, the amount of damage a character can receive; magic points, which determine the number of times a character can use magical attacks; strength, the power of a character's physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character's magical spells. Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2036, the weapon choices are largely medieval, including swords, axes, and spears, although handguns and a rocket-propelled grenade are available. These weapons differ in their damage output, their range, and the speed of the attack.\n\n\"Dawn of Sorrow\", like most games in the \"Castlevania\" series, is set in a castle, which is subdivided into various areas. Areas of the castle differ in their composition, including monsters and terrain features. In addition, each area has its own unique piece of theme music that plays while the player is in that area. The character moves around the environment based on the player's choices; however, the items the player has restricts the areas the character can move into, like most platform games. Progression, however, is not linear, as players are free to explore the parts of the castle they have access to, and can backtrack or move forward as they see fit.\n\nThe primary method for the player to gain additional abilities in the game is the absorption of souls via the Tactical Soul system originally featured in \"Aria of Sorrow\". Except for human enemies and the game's final opponent, the player can absorb all enemies' souls. The chances for absorbing a soul varies on the enemy, as certain enemies will release souls more regularly than others. The player can absorb multiple copies of the same soul; many of these souls will increase in effectiveness depending on the number of the same soul a player possesses. Souls provide a variety of effects and are separated into four categories: Bullet, Guardian, Enchant, and Ability souls. The player can have only one type of Bullet, Guardian, and Enchant soul equipped at any given time. However, when the player acquires the \"Dopplegänger\" soul, they can have two different weapon and soul setups, and switch between them at will. Players can trade souls wirelessly using two \"Dawn of Sorrow\" game cards.\n\nBullet souls are often projectiles and consume a set amount of magic points upon use. Guardian souls provide continuous effects including transforming into mythical creatures, defensive abilities, and the summoning of familiars. The movement and attacking of familiars can be directly controlled with the stylus. Guardian souls continually drain magic points so long as they are activated. Several Guardian souls can be used in with Bullet souls to execute special attacks called Tactical Soul combos. Enchant souls offer statistical bonuses and resistance against several forms of attack. They are passive, and require no magic points to remain active. Ability souls give the player new abilities and are required to move into certain areas of the castle. They are always active, and therefore not equipped—nor do they consume magic points. Some examples include the abilities to break ice blocks with the stylus and to double-jump.\n\nSouls can also be spent to permanently transform a character's weapon. At Yoko Belnades' shop, the player can remove certain souls from their inventory to change their weapon into a stronger form. Certain weapons can only be acquired by using souls to strengthen a lesser form of the weapon. Souls are also used in the \"Enemy Set\" mode, where a player builds a custom scenario. The player can place monsters inside rooms if they have acquired the monster's soul in the main game, but boss enemies cannot be added to any scenario, even if the player has the boss' soul. Two players using two Nintendo DS consoles can compete in these scenarios, with the winner being the one with the fastest time completing the course.\n\nThe Magic Seal system is a new feature introduced in \"Dawn of Sorrow\" that uses of the DS touchscreen. Once the player reduces the hit points of a \"boss\" enemy to zero, a circle will appear, and the game will automatically draw a pattern connecting any number of smaller circles on the circumference of the larger circle. After this, the player is prompted to draw the same pattern on the touchscreen in a set amount of time. If the player fails to draw the pattern accurately within the time limit, the boss will regain health and the battle will resume. If successful, the boss will be defeated. More powerful boss enemies require higher level Magic Seals, which have more intricate and complex patterns as the level increases and are found over the course of the game.\n\nAfter the player completes the game with either the bad ending or the best ending, Julius Mode, similar to that in \"Aria of Sorrow\" is unlocked. In storyline terms, Julius Mode follows the assumption that Soma succumbed to his dark power and became the new dark lord. A new game can then be started from the main menu in Julius Mode. In Julius Mode the playable characters include Julius Belmont, Yoko Belnades, and Alucard. Each character has a weapon and assorted unique abilities. Although these abilities remain static throughout the entire game, the characters' statistics can improve by acquiring enough experience points to level up. The castle layout and enemies are the same except for the final battle, which is against Soma.\n\n\"Dawn of Sorrow\" is set in the fictional universe of the \"Castlevania\" series. The primary premise of the series is the struggle of the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan against the vampire Dracula and his legacy. Before the events of \"\", Dracula was permanently defeated and his castle sealed within a solar eclipse. With Dracula dead, a prophecy relating to who would inherit his powers drove the events of \"Aria of Sorrow\", with the protagonist, Soma Cruz, realizing that he was Dracula's reincarnation. Soma manages to escape his fate of becoming the new dark lord with the help of his allies. \"Dawn of Sorrow\" takes place one year after the events of \"Aria of Sorrow\", when Soma believes that his inherited powers have been lost. Most of the game is played inside a copy of Dracula's castle, which is subdivided into several areas through which the player must venture over the course of the game. The future setting of both \"Aria of Sorrow\" and \"Dawn of Sorrow\", as well as a storyline beginning after Dracula's defeat, reflects Koji Igarashi's desire to take a \"different route\" with \"Aria of Sorrow\".\n\nThe primary playable character in \"Dawn of Sorrow\" is Soma Cruz, the reincarnation of Dracula, the longtime antagonist of the \"Castlevania\" series. Mina Hakuba, the daughter of the priest of the Hakuba shrine supports him in his quest; , a mysterious government agent dealing primarily with the supernatural; Julius Belmont, the latest member of the Belmont clan of vampire hunters featured in the series; Yoko Belnades, a witch in the service of the Roman Catholic Church; and Hammer, a vendor of military material who retains a large information network.\n\nA cult dedicated to the resurrection of the dark lord serves as the game's antagonists. Celia Fortner is a shadow priestess heading the cult. She seeks to revive the dark lord to prevent the loss of her magical powers. , a ruthless manipulator, and , a vicious firebrand, are Celia's primary lieutenants. They are the \"dark lord's candidates\", born on the day Dracula was slain and thus can assume the mantle of dark lord by destroying Dracula's soul, which is present in Soma Cruz.\n\nOne year after the events in \"Aria of Sorrow\", Soma is living peacefully, and believes that his powers have been lost. A woman who identifies herself as Celia Fortner, appears and summons several monsters. Arikado arrives to help Soma defeat the monsters, after which Soma absorbs their souls. Celia retreats, proclaiming that she will destroy Soma. Soma expresses disbelief at the return of his powers, but Arikado reveals that his powers were never lost, only dormant. He informs Soma that Celia is the head of a cult that seeks the resurrection of the dark lord. He leaves, instructing Soma not to pursue Celia.\n\nSoma, however, uses information acquired from Hammer to locate the cult's base, a facsimile of Dracula's castle. Hammer arrives, and as he has left the military, agrees to help Soma by opening up a shop in the village outside the castle. After entering the castle, Soma encounters Yoko and Julius Belmont. As Julius leaves, Soma escorts Yoko to a safe location. During this time, she instructs him in the use of a Magic Seal, which is necessary to defeat certain monsters in the castle. As Soma travels farther into the castle, he meets Celia, who is flanked by two men, Dmitrii Blinov and Dario Bossi. Celia explains their nature as the \"dark lord's candidates\", who can become the dark lord by destroying Soma. He later encounters Dmitrii and is able to defeat him. Soma gains dominance over his soul, although he acquires no abilities. As Soma travels further, he comes upon Dario. Soma bests him, and Celia teleports Dario away from harm.\n\nSoma meets Arikado, who is initially angered by Soma's presence, but accepts the situation. He gives Soma a letter and a talisman from Mina. Soma briefs Arikado on the current situation, and Arikado leaves to locate Dario. Soma comes upon Dario and Julius who is later defeated due to his inability to use the Magic Seals. Dario retreats, instructing Soma to fight him in the castle's throne room. Soma does so, lambasting Dario for only desiring power, and promising to defeat him. Before the battle begins, Soma uses one of his souls to transport himself into the mirror in the room, revealing Aguni, the flame demon sealed within Dario's soul. Soma defeats Aguni, leaving Dario powerless. As Dario flees, Celia arrives, and instructs Soma to come to the castle's center.\n\nUpon arriving, Soma is forced to watch Celia kill Mina. Furious, he begins to succumb to his dark power. The talisman that Mina gave Soma is able to slow the transformation, enabling Arikado to arrive in time to inform Soma that the \"Mina\" who Celia killed was a doppelgänger. This aborts the transformation, but a soul leaves Soma and enters the doppelgänger, which takes on the appearance of Dmitrii. Dmitrii says that when Soma defeated him he allowed himself to be absorbed, wishing to use his powers to copy Soma's ability to dominate the souls of Dracula's minions. He then leaves with Celia to absorb the souls of many powerful demons and monsters in an attempt to increase his power. Soma and Arikado chase after the pair, and find them in the castle's basement. Dmitrii, using Celia as a sacrifice, seals Arikado's powers, and engages Soma. However, his soul is unable to bear the strain of controlling the demons he has absorbed, and they erupt out of him, combining into one gargantuan creature called Menace. Soma manages to defeat it, but the souls that composed the demon begin to fall under Soma's dominance. He becomes overwhelmed and rejects them, fleeing from the castle with Arikado. Soma is conflicted over the present situation. He believes that it was his responsibility to become the dark lord, and that the events of the game were the result of him not accepting this responsibility. Arikado convinces him that his fate is not fixed. Soma then shares a tender moment with Mina, much to the amusement of his onlooking friends.\n\nThe production of \"Dawn of Sorrow\" was announced on January 6, 2005, as the first \"Castlevania\" game to be released for the Nintendo DS. Longtime \"Castlevania\" producer Koji Igarashi was in charge of the production. The choice to develop the game for the Nintendo DS instead of the Sony PlayStation Portable was due to \"Aria of Sorrow\"s success on Nintendo's Game Boy Advance, and Igarashi's observations of both consoles during the 2005 E3 Media and Business Summit. He felt that it was a waste to use the storyline with Soma Cruz and the Tactical Soul system in only one game, contributing to his desire to make a sequel. The original design team from \"Aria of Sorrow\", as well as personnel from Konami Tokyo, were involved in the production of \"Dawn of Sorrow\". Igarashi intended to include a white-collar Japanese worker in the game. This worker would be a manager in a Japanese firm and have a family. However, the development team's opposition to this idea forced him to drop it.\n\nThe use of the technical features of the Nintendo DS was one of the production team's principal concerns during development. The DS touch screen was a primary point of interest. Several functions such as picking up items on the screen and moving them were originally intended to be incorporated into the game. However, scheduling problems forced the development team to abandon many of these ideas. Igarashi's primary concern with using the touch screen was that it would detract from \"the \"Castlevania\" pure action gameplay\", since the player would have to slow down play to use the stylus. The DS microphone was looked at during development, but Igarashi noted that although he found humorous uses for it, it was never seriously considered for inclusion in the game.\n\nFor the graphical representations of the game's enemies, Igarashi had sprites from earlier \"Castlevania\" games such as \"\" reused, and the development team redesigned them for use on the Nintendo DS. Unlike most recent \"Castlevania\" games, Ayami Kojima did not participate in designing the characters for \"Dawn of Sorrow\". Instead, the characters were drawn in a distinctive anime style, influenced by producer Koji Igarashi who wanted to market the game to a younger audience. \"Aria of Sorrow\"s sales figures did not meet expectations, and as a result, Igarashi consulted Konami's sales department. The staff concluded that the demographics of the Game Boy Advance did not line up with the series' target age group. Igarashi believed that the Nintendo DS inherently attracted a younger audience, and he was working to court them with the anime style. Furthermore, Igarashi considered the anime style a litmus test for whether future \"Castlevania\" games would incorporate it. Kojima's hiatus from \"Dawn of Sorrow\" allowed her to concentrate upon her character designs for \"\".\n\nMichiru Yamane and Masahiko Kimura composed the game's music. Yamane, a longtime composer of music for the \"Castlevania\" series, had worked earlier on the music of \"Castlevania\" games such as \"Symphony of the Night\" and \"Aria of Sorrow\". Kimura had developed the music for \"Castlevania\" on the Nintendo 64. In an interview, Yamane noted that she made the music \"simple\" and \"easy to recognize\", similar to her work on previous \"Castlevania\" games. She drew a parallel between her work on \"Castlevania\" games for the Game Boy Advance and her music for \"Dawn of Sorrow\". In the same interview Igarashi said that making music for handheld game consoles, regardless of the type, is largely the same, although he accepted that the DS's sound capabilities were better than those of the Game Boy Advance.\n\nIn Japan, the game sold over 15,000 units in its first week, acquiring the number ten slot in software sales. The game sold over 164,000 copies in the first three months after its release in the United States. The game was later re-released in both Japan and North America as part of Konami's \"Konami the Best\" line.\n\n\"Dawn of Sorrow\" has received critical acclaim from many video game publications, with several hailing it as the best Nintendo DS game of 2005. \n\nJapanese gaming publication \"Famitsu\" gave it a 33 out of 40 score. Many reviewers noted that despite being highly similar to \"Aria of Sorrow\", it managed to define itself as a standalone title. \"GameSpot\" commented that \"Dawn of Sorrow\" succeeded in continuing 2D games as a definite genre, and that it \"keeps that flame burning as bright as ever\". \"GameSpot\" also considered it for the accolade of best Nintendo DS game of 2005, with the prize ultimately going to \"Mario Kart DS\". Editors at IGN awarded \"Dawn of Sorrow\" the prize of best adventure game on the DS for 2005.\n\nThe gameplay, and the Tactical Soul system in particular, received praise from reviewers. The sheer depth of the abilities of the numerous souls found in the game was lauded, and IGN believed that the ability to have two customizable \"profiles\" of different abilities was \"an extremely handy idea\". The relative difficulty of the game and its length was also brought into question, with \"GameSpot\" noting that the game could be finished in five hours and \"is fairly easy as far as \"Castlevania\" games go\".\n\n\"GameSpot\" extolled the game's animation and graphics, describing the backgrounds as \"intricate and gorgeous\" and the individual animation, especially of enemies, as one of the game's \"highlights\". IGN echoed this assessment, calling the animation \"stunning and fluid\", and noted the differences in graphics between \"Aria of Sorrow\" and \"Dawn of Sorrow\", stating that the latter was on a \"broader and more impressive scale\". Reviewers lambasted the use of an anime style of drawing the characters, as opposed to the traditional gothic presentation of illustrator Ayami Kojima in earlier \"Castlevania\" games. GameSpy deplored the \"shallow, lifeless anime images\" used for the characters and Kojima's absence from the production. IGN believed the new images were \"down to the level of 'generic Saturday morning Anime' quality\". The audio by Michiru Yamane and Masahiko Kimura was highly regarded, with GameSpot stating that it was \"head and shoulders above [\"Aria of Sorrow\"]\". IGN noted that the DS dual speaker system presented the audio \"extraordinarily well\". In the review from 1UP.com, the game's score was compared to the soundtrack of \"Symphony of the Night\", with \"excellent\" sound quality and \"exceptional\" compositions.\n\nThe functionality associated with the Nintendo DS, namely the touch screen and the Magic Seal system, was subject to criticism from reviewers. GameSpot noted that it was difficult to use the stylus immediately after the game prompted the player to draw the Magic Seal, thus forcing the player to use their fingernail on the touch screen. Other functions using the touch screen, including clearing ice blocks, were viewed as trivial, with GameSpy calling it a \"gimmick\". However, IGN dismissed the lack of DS functionality as a major issue, claiming that it \"doesn't hurt the product in the slightest\".\n\nIn 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book \"1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die\".\n\n"}

For the third film,\"Cicak Man 3\" (2015), the film were co-directed by Yusry and Ghaz Abu Bakar .\n\nFor the first two films, Hairi (Saiful Apek) developed a relationship with his lab partner crush, Tania Ashraf (Fasha Sandha). He battled the villains Professor Klon (Aznil Nawawi), Ginger 1 /Ginger Ghost 1 (Adlin Aman Ramlie), Ginger 2/Ginger Ghost 2 (AC Mizal), and Rrama (Tamara Bleszynski). For the third film, Hairi have abandoned his responsibility as Cicak Man and leave Metrofulus. A new superhero emerged during his absence, known as SuperBro (Yus Jambu). He left a box containing all the requirements to become a Cicak Man inside Cicak Man statue in Metrofulus which later being discovered by his successor, Man (Zizan Razak).\n\nThe film was shot using Dolby TrueHD, and about 40% of the film was shot in Green Screen. The visual effects team led by the director, Yusry, used CGI technology to fully realize the fictional city of Bandar Metrofulus (which was based on Kuala Lumpur), the protagonist's super-hero movements and various digital sets. Over 90% of the rotoscoping and compositing work were carried out by KRU Films (now known as KRU Studios), who were also behind the musical scores and audio effects.\n\nThe shooting that took place in Penang, Gua Tempurung, Kampar, Universiti Teknologi Petronas, and Kuala Lumpur costs 2.5 million Ringgit. The costume used in the sequel is higher in quality than the prequel as well as the price cost RM 50 thousand per set while in the prequel the costume used costs only RM 20 thousand per set.\n\nThe shooting took place in Kuala Lumpur and Johor. The production cost were 4 million Ringgit. The rise in cost is mostly due to the cost of the costume for Cicak Man and SuperBro, each amounted 100 thousand Ringgit each.\n\nAfter this long development history, the \"Cicak Man\" films were produced by Norman Abdul Halim, Yusry Abdul Halim, Edry Abdul HalimJohn Lucas and distributed by KRU, Grand Brilliance Sdn Bhd, PT Tripar Multi Vision Plus, Cathay-Keris Films Pte Ltd, the primary film production holding of KRU. They both directed by director Yusry Abdul Halim.\n\nHairi (Saiful Apek), is a loser who lives in Metrofulus. While working in the lab, he accidentally drinks coffee that has been contaminated by a virus-infected gecko. He soon finds himself doing the most insane things, such as sticking to walls, making chirping cicak noises and adding bugs to his menu. He turns to his best friend and apartment mate, Danny (Yusry Abdul Halim), and begs him to find the reason behind his strange antics.\n\nMeanwhile, the people of Metrofulus are constantly being infected by new strains of viruses, and the only cure seems to come only from Professor Klon's (Aznil Nawawi) lab. Suspecting something amiss, Hairi and Danny launch their own investigation and discover that Professor Klon is not only the creator of such viruses, but also has a more sinister plan up his sleeve, backed by his business partners, the Ginger Boys (played by Adlin Aman Ramlie and AC Mizal), who first tend to take revenge on Professor Klon's failed experiment on them; making their senses turn abnormal. Hairi soon makes use his new power as \"Cicakman\" and makes a fullstop to Professor Klon and Ginger Boys, while same time leading his love towards his lab partner, Tania (Fasha Sandha).\n\nThe evil Professor Klon (Aznil Nawawi) is back. This time, not only to overthrow the government and become the President of Metrofulus, but also to control the world's supply of fresh water through his ingenious plan; \"Black Planet\". When our blue planet has only 72 hours before turning black, Cicakman (Saiful Apek) comes to rescue.\n\nBut much to his surprise he face his old enemies; Ginger Boys, who return even more powerful as spiritual form as Ginger Ghosts (Adlin Aman Ramlie & AC Mizal). In addition, he is now faced with Professor Klon's hired assassin; Rrama (Tamara Bleszynski), an assassin who derives pleasure in killing as if it were a pure art form. As the situation starts taking a downward spiral, even a super hero needs help. But help appears in the most unexpected forms, including Danny (Yusry Abd Halim) his demised best friend, a powerful feng shui master, Miss Chee (Louisa Chong) and an unlikely party.\n\nApart from his heavy responsibilities to save the world, he also has his own personal dilemmas to address; that is Hairi vs Cicakman. He has to resolve his personal feelings towards Tania (Fasha Sandha), who is seeking the true identity of Cicakman and he also has to choose whether to sacrifice his own life or save Iman (Sharifah Amani), Danny's blind sister.\n\nSet after 7 years of the event of \"\". Metrofulus superhero, Cicakman had disappeared, many people say Cicakman is dead or retire. So, The new superhero has emerged known as Superbro has become a major superhero in Metrofulus and he is venerated by many people. The man named Man (Zizan Razak) has found a box left by former Cicakman (Saiful Apek) at the Cicakman monument.\n\nList indicator(s)\n\n\n\"Cicak-Man\" created Malaysian movie history by grossing RM350,000 with an audience attendance number of 47,116 in its first day. The film eventually gave its production company, KRU Group of Companies, a RM6.7 million boost due to sales. Cicak-Man received many appreciation from various persons for the director's efforts even before it is released. One of them is Dato' Yusof Haslam alias \"Six Million Dollar Man\". David Teo as a film producer and CEO of Metrowealth International Group referred Cicak Man as a miracle with the response and difference shown in Malaysian filming industry. Besides film maker, ex-president of Persatuan Sutradara Malaysia (FDAM), Ahmad Ibrahim, praised this masterpiece created by Yusry and KRU. While there were people who praised Cicak Man, there were many others who criticized this film greatly. Mansor Putih in an interview by Harian Metro said that the film has no 'soul', aesthetic values and culture. There were individuals who compared between Cicak Man and Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, and other superhero films from Hollywood, but before it was released to public, the director, Yusry had advised people to not compare Cicak Man with other superhero characters because the budget is obviously lower compared to Hollywood productions.. \"Cicakman 2 - Planet Hitam\" was first released at the 13th Pusan International Film Festival on October 5, 2008 as world premiere for superheroes in Asia segment. Other two sessions was held on October 7 at the festival. In Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, the film had been released on 11 December 2008 with the goal by the producer of a million tickets sold compared to 670 thousand tickets sold for \"Cicak Man\". The film is expected to be released in Indonesia in January 2009.\n"}
{"id": "1890951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890951", "title": "Cleavage (breasts)", "text": "Cleavage (breasts)\n\nCleavage is the exposed area between a woman’s breasts lying over the sternum, and refers \"only\" to what is visible with clothing (or dense, nontransparent body art) that includes a low-cut neckline. In some cultures, display of cleavage is considered aesthetic or erotic, and may be associated with garments with low necklines that expose or highlight cleavage, such as ball gowns, evening gowns, lingerie, and swimwear. In these cultures women have, throughout history, sought to enhance their physical attractiveness and femininity, within the context of changing fashions and cultural-specific norms of modesty of the time and place. The methods practised in appropriate contexts have included the accentuation and partial display of breasts, including cleavage. In some cultures any display of cleavage may be culturally taboo (e.g. \"juyub\" in Islam,) illegal or otherwise socially disapproved.\n\nThe anatomical term for the area that constitutes a cleavage is intermammary cleft, intermammary sulcus or sulcus intermammarius.\n\nDécolletage is the upper part of a woman's torso, between her waist and neck, comprising her neck, shoulders, back and chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. However, the term is most commonly applied to a neckline that reveals or emphasizes cleavage.\n\nWhen the side of the breasts are uncovered, it is known as \"side cleavage\", \"sidewinders\" or \"sideboob\". In early 2010s side cleavage was identified as a fashion trend. Gabriele Hackworthy, fashion director at \"Harper's Bazaar\", said, \"The look is unlikely to fade fast, with Yves Saint Laurent and Roberto Cavalli both pushing the silhouette next season.\"\n\nWhen the lower part of the breasts is uncovered, it is called \"underboob\".\n\nMany people in Western culture, both male and female, consider breasts an important female secondary sex characteristic and an important aspect of femininity. Décolletage that exposes cleavage is used by many women to enhance their physical and sexual attractiveness and to improve their sense of femininity. Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine flirting or seduction, as much as for its aesthetic or erotic effect. Most men derive erotic pleasure from seeing a woman's cleavage, and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low neckline it can draw attention. During adolescence, some girls become fixated on breast shape and cleavage. The use of tight clothing and the display of cleavage have been attributed as causes of an increase in breast fetishism, and atypical paraphilia.\n\nIn Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much cleavage exposure is acceptable in public. In contemporary Western society, the extent to which a woman may expose her breasts depends on social and cultural context. Displaying cleavage or any part of female breast may be considered inappropriate or even prohibited by dress codes in some settings, such as workplaces, churches, and schools, while in some spaces showing as much cleavage as possible can be permissible or even encouraged. The exposure of nipples or areolae is almost always considered immodest and in some instances is viewed as lewd or indecent behavior. Art historian James Laver argued that the changing standards of revealing cleavage is more prominent in evening wear than in day wear in the Western world.\n\nThere is historical evidence that some cultures strongly discouraged cleavage or any hint of a bosom. Early English Puritans used a tight bodice to flatten breasts completely, while 17th century Spaniards put lead plates across the chests of young girls to prevent their bosoms from developing.\n\nIn the Quran, the holy book of Islam, it is stated, \"Let them draw their Khimar (shawl/head veil) over their \"juyub\" (breast-line/cleavage)\". The \"ayat\" refers to the women's clothes worn, parted in the front to expose the breasts, at the time when it was cited. It was later interpreted as total covering of a woman's body. In early 21st century Muslim world there are differences in legal implementation. In Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, women are required to cover their body and face completely, Iranian law requires a chador (over-cloak) or a hijab (head scarf). In Egypt, the exposure of cleavage in the media is considered to be nudity.\n\nThe cleavage area between the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and stimulation of interest. Breast and buttock cleavages, sharing a similarity between their appearances, are considered sexual in some cultures. British zoologist and ethologist Desmond Morris theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks. Swelling of the anterior is a sign of mating-readiness in ape species. Among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture reduces visibility of the buttocks, but the breasts are significantly enlarged. Theorists hypothesize that with these evolutionary changes, the measure of mating-readiness and attractiveness in females has shifted from swagging buttocks to the pendulous shape of breasts and cleavage.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists theorize that humans' permanently enlarged breasts, in contrast to other primates' breasts, which only enlarge during ovulation, allowed females to \"solicit male attention and investment even when they are not really fertile\", though Morris notes that in recent years there has been a trend toward reversing breast augmentations. According to social historian David Kunzle, waist confinement and décolletage are the primary sexualization devices of Western costume. By the turn of the 21st century, some of the attention given to cleavage and breasts started to shift to buttocks, especially in the media.\n\nIn 2600 BCE, princess Nofret of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt was depicted in a V-neck gown with a plunging neckline that exposed ample cleavage. In 1600 BCE, Snake Goddess figurines were sculpted in Minos with open dress-fronts, revealing entire breasts. Ancient Greek goddess Hera wore an early version of a push-up bra, described in the \"Iliad\" as festooned with \"brooches of gold\" and \"a hundred tassels\", to increase her cleavage to divert Zeus from the Trojan War.\n\nDécolletage was often a feature of the dress of the late Middle Ages. This continued through the Victorian period. Gowns that exposed a woman's neck and top of her chest were very common and uncontroversial in Europe from at least the 11th century until the Victorian period in the 19th century. Ball or evening gowns especially featured low square décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage.\n\nIn the 14th century, necklines were lowered, clothes were tightened and breasts were once again flaunted. In 1450, Agnès Sorel, mistress to Charles VII of France, is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with fully bared breasts in the French court. Other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included Simonetta Vespucci, whose portrait with exposed breasts was painted by Piero di Cosimo in c.1480.\n\nIn many European societies between the Renaissance and the 19th century, wearing low-cut dresses that exposed breasts was more acceptable than today; with a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders being considered to be more risqué than exposed breasts. In aristocratic and upper-class circles the display of breasts was at times regarded as a status symbol, as a sign of beauty, wealth or social position. The bared breast even invoked associations with nude sculptures of classical Greece that were exerting an influence on art, sculpture, and architecture of the period. After the French Revolution décolletage become larger in the front and less in the back.\n\nDuring the 16th century, women's fashions with exposed breasts were common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and emulated by all classes. Anne of Brittany has also been painted wearing a dress with a square neckline. Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even Queen Mary II and Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of England, were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect Inigo Jones designed a masque costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both of her breasts. During the fashions of the period 1795–1820, many women wore dresses that bared necks, bosoms and shoulders. Anne of Austria was known for wearing, along with female members of her court, very tight bodice and corsets that forced breasts together to make deeper cleavages, very low necklines that exposed breasts visible almost in entirety above the areola and pendants lying on the cleavage to highlight it.\n\nDuring the Victorian period, social attitudes required women to cover their bosom in public. For ordinary wear, high collars were the norm. Towards the end of the Victorian period (end 19th century) the full collar was the fashion, though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions (see 1880s in fashion).\n\nDuring the French Enlightenment, there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift to be offered from mother to child. In Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy's 1771 play \"The True Mother\" (\"La Vraie Mère\"), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: \"Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts – the respectable treasures of nature – as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?\" Nearly a century later, also in France, a man from the provinces who attended a Court ball at the Tuileries in Paris in 1855 was deeply shocked by the décolleté dresses and is said to have exclaimed in disgust: \"I haven't seen anything like that since I was weaned!\"\n\nIn 1884 \"Portrait of Madame X\", a portrait painting by John Singer Sargent of American-born Paris socialite, Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau, was criticized for depicting her in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen off her shoulder. The controversy was so great that he reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder, and Sargent left Paris for London in 1884. In 1908, a single pad made of rubber or a \"bust form\" was advertised that was to be worn inside the front of the bodice to make cleavage virtually undetectable.\n\nClergymen all over the world became shocked when dresses to be worn with modest round or V-shaped necklines became fashionable around 1913. In the German Empire, for example, all Roman Catholic bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking the new fashions. Fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became more accepted in Western societies during World War I and remained so for nearly half a century.\n\nIn 1953, Hollywood film \"The French Line\" was found objectionable under the Hays Code because of Jane Russell's \"breast shots in bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure\" while some of her décollete gowns were thought \"...intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme decolletage.\" But other actresses defied the then standards. For example, Gina Lollobrigida raised eyebrows with her famous low-cut dress in 1960, and other celebrities, performers and models followed suit, and the public was not far behind. Low-cut styles of various depths are now common in many situations. During the 1950s, Hollywood and the fashion industry successfully promoted large cloven bustlines (and falsies). In the late 1960s, erogenous attention began to shift from the large bust to the trim lower torso, reasserting the need to diet, especially as new clothing fashions — brief, sheer, and close fitting — prohibited heavy reliance on foundation lingerie. Legs were relatively less emphasized as elements of beauty.\n\nFrom the 1960s onward, however, changes in fashions were towards increasing displays of cleavage in films and television, with Jane Russell and Elizabeth Taylor being the biggest stars who led the fashion, and in everyday life low-cut dress styles became very common, even for casual wear. The Wonderbra was created in 1964 by Louise Poirier for Canadelle, a Canadian lingerie company. It had 54 design elements that lift and support the bustline while creating a deep plunge and push-together effect.\n\nThe ideal of breasts and cleavage has also evolved in the later half of the 20th century, with shapes enhanced by use of a variety of methods and techniques. In the 1950s the preferred shape was pointy, echoing the sci-fi look of the times; in the 1960s it was elegantly sloped in alignment with Hippie chic of the times; and from the 1990s a buffed, pumped and engorged look has become the preference.\n\n21st century women's fashions, especially at formal occasions, has increasingly included low-cut dress designs which expose cleavage. Such dress designs have been most noticeable at various awards presentations, such as those seen at the 2016 Academy Awards. However, such low-cut dresses still attract comment, though less controversy. It was also noticeable in the 2013 film \"American Hustle\", as well as in films which expose cleavage in a low-cut bra or swimsuit.\n\nDisplay of cleavage can still be controversial. In the United States, in two separate incidents in 2007, Southwest Airlines crews asked travelers to modify their clothing, to wear sweaters or to leave the airplane because the crew did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed acceptable. In Langley, British Columbia, a young woman was sent home from her high school for wearing a top that her principal deemed inappropriate because \"it showed too much cleavage.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel created controversy when she wore a low-cut evening gown to the opening of the Oslo Opera House in 2008; U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton and British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith drew attention for wearing low-cut blouses that revealed a small amount of cleavage, resulting in comments in the \"Washington Post\" and the \"New York Times.\" Vera Lengsfeld, the Conservative Christian Democratic Union candidate for Berlin's Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg district, used pictures of herself and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in low-cut dresses during her political campaign. Facing a tough campaign, she posted 750 provocative campaign posters, accompanied by the slogan \"We Have More to Offer\" to draw attention to \"serious election issues.\" The posters had a positive impact.\n\nVarious methods have been used by women in history to enhance their physical attractiveness and femininity including the accentuation and display of breasts within the context of fashions and norms of modesty of the time and place.\n\nCorsets that enhanced cleavage were introduced in the mid-16th century. By the late 18th century, cleavage-enhancing corsets grew more dramatic in pushing the breasts upward. The tight lacing of corsets worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized both cleavage and the size of the bust and hips. Especially evening or ball gowns were designed to display and emphasize the décolletage.\n\nWhen corsets became unfashionable, brassieres and padding helped to project, display and emphasize the breasts. In 1893, New Yorker Marie Tucek was granted a patent for a \"breast supporter,\" described as a modification of the corset, and was very similar to a modern push-up bra designed to support the breasts. It consisted of a plate made of metal, cardboard or other stiff material shaped to fit against the torso under the breasts, following the contour of the breasts. It was covered with silk, canvas or other cloth, which extended above the plate to form a pocket for each breast. The plate curved around the torso and ended near the armpits.\n\nDevelopment of the underwire bra started in the 1930s, though it did not gain widespread popularity until the 1950s, when the end of World War II freed metal for domestic use. Aviator and filmmaker Howard Hughes designed a prototype for an aerodynamic underwire bra for Jane Russell when filming \"The Outlaw\" in 1941. According to Hughes, the resultant amount was \"the length of the actual cleavage is five and one-quarter inches.\" Several brassiere manufacturers, among them Wonderbra and Victoria's Secret, produce push-up and other types of bras that enhance cleavage. Frederick's of Hollywood introduced a design called Hollywood Extreme Cleavage Bra that helped give the impression of a spherical cleavage like augmented breasts that was popularized by stars like Pamela Anderson.\n\nMany women, such as beauty pageant participants and transgender people, create cleavage by using tape underneath and across their breast, bending forward, tightly pulling them together and up. Types of tape used include surgical micropore tape and athletic tape. Some also use a strip of moleskin under the breasts with tape at the ends to hold it in place. Use of the wrong techniques or tape with too strong an adhesive can cause injuries such as rashes, blisters and skin being torn off.\n\nBigger breasts are easier to push together to accent the hollow between them. Some flat-chested women feel self-conscious about their small breasts and want to improve their sexual attractiveness by seeking breast augmentation. Plastic surgeon Gerard H. Pitman says, \"you can't have cleavage with an A cup. You have to be at least a B or a C.\" A similar statement was made for non-surgical cleavage enhancement as well (i.e. lingerie manufacturers Frederick's of Hollywood promises \"high-rise cleavage to small busts\" and Curvees in Etam claims to give girls with a B cup an \"exciting C cup cleavage\").\n\nBreast surgery for emplacing breast implants can be done for three purposes:\n\n\nFor breast reconstruction and for the augmentation and enhancement of the aesthetics — size, shape, and texture — of a woman's breasts, there are two types of breast implant devices in practice: saline implants filled with sterile saline solution and silicone implants filled with viscous silicone gel.\n\nIf a surgeon attempts to create or increase cleavage by loosening the medial borders of the breasts, it could result in symmastia, a confluence of the breast tissue of both breasts across the midline anterior to the sternum, creating a lack of defined cleavage. Procedures are generally followed during breast reconstruction to preserve a natural cleavage of breasts.\n\nRegular exercise of the muscles and fibres of the pectoral complex, which lies just under the fatty tissues of the breast, helps prevent droopiness and can create the illusion of larger and firmer breasts and an enhanced cleavage. Weight training, use of exercise machines, push ups and chest presses are considered helpful, as well as a number of other exercises, including rowing and basketball. In some forms of exercise, breasts unsupported by a sports bra are exposed to greater risk of droopiness.\n\nMaking cleavage appear deeper and the breasts look fuller alongside the cleavage with makeup is achieved using shading effects. The middle of the cleavage is made to look deeper by using a darker makeup colour than the base colour of the skin, while the most prominent areas of the breasts (either side of the cleavage) are made to look larger or more protruding by the use of a paler colour.\n\n\n\n"}

Cosmetics were made from lotions extracted from plants, including gourd stems; Ground mung bean contains saponin and was helpful for cleansing. Castor oils and camellia oils were used as hair oil. They had a pleasant smell and were not sticky. To moisturise and add gloss to the skin, safflower oil was used. Apricot and peach oils were used to remove freckles and liver spots. A powder called 'mibun' or 'baekbun' was made from ground rice and millet blended with water or oil.\n\nScents were added to extracts from grains and other plants, for example from dried clove buds. Perfume was also used to relieve stresses and tiredness. The \"Gyuhap Chongseo\", an ancient women's encyclopedia, includes various methods for making perfume.\n\nAccording to \"Gyuhap Chongseo\", eyebrows were the central feature of a woman's face. The work describes ten popular eyebrow shapes. Crescent or willow leaf shapes were most popular. Plant ash was the basic raw material used for eyebrow ink, with which women drew their eyebrows in various shapes. The primary colors were black, blue, and dark brown.\n\n\"Yeonji\" is the Korean name of rouge, which was used to colour the lips and cheeks. It could be made from safflower.\n\nIn the Joseon period, luxurious makeup was forbidden because of Confucianism. Upper-class women tended to copy the makeup and style of gisaeng during this period.\n\nFollowing the Treaty of Kanghwa in 1876, Korean ports opened to foreign trade and Western styles began to influence the country. New makeup styles and products became popular, stimulating Korea's cosmetics culture and enabling mass production and consumption.\n\n\"Bakgabun\", which means Park's powder, was the first mass-produced cosmetics item in Korea. It was the first Korean face powder and was a bestseller from 1916 to 1930. However, because of its lead content, sales then fell rapidly and similar products were quickly launched.\n\nAs a result of the dominance of Japanese cosmetic brands, Korean cosmetics failed to develop in the 1920s. After the country was no longer under Japanese control, the Korean War that began in 1950 further disrupted the economy. Finally, around 1961, the Korean cosmetics industry began to prosper after the passage of a law banning sales of other countries' products.\n\nKorean people focus on skin care under the influence of TV programs, advertisements and tradition. Koreans highly value even, radiant skin, and Korean women tend to vary their beauty care regimen with the season. They use different kinds of moisturizers such as cream for tightening pores (BB cream, blemish balm or beauty balm) and lotions for lightening the skin (CC cream, colour correction or colour control).\n\nKoreans generally apply makeup every day because it offers sun protection, a major concern. A big focus of Korean skincare is skin lightening, which is why many Korean cosmetic products have brightening properties. Skin brightening is not the same as skin bleaching, also known as skin whitening, which is a reduction of melanin in the skin. Instead, skin lightening is focused on treating hyperpigmentation.\nIn order to achieve a perfectly even skin tone, Korean women go so far as to perform a daily 8 to 10-step skincare routine. Traditionally, these extensive routines include makeup remover, double cleansing (i.e. consecutive oil and water-based cleansing), exfoliator, toner, essence (lightweight hydrating concentrates), treatments (boosters, serums, ampoules), sheet masks (thin cotton sheets doused in a liquid-based formula that claims to moisturize, brighten, and even treat fine lines), eye cream, moisturizer and sunscreen.\n\nKorean men are also interested in skincare. Some use BB or CC cream. Cosmetics manufactured specifically for men in South Korea focus on soothing the skin after daily shaving.\n\nSouth Korea is home to several large cosmetic brands, many of which export their products worldwide. They include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1054245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1054245", "title": "Country Life (magazine)", "text": "Country Life (magazine)\n\nCountry Life is a British weekly perfect-bound, glossy magazine, based in London at 110 Southwark Street (until March 2016 when it became based in Farnborough, Hampshire), and owned by TI Media.\n\n\"Country Life\" was launched in 1897, incorporating \"Racing Illustrated\". At this time it was owned by Edward Hudson, the owner of Lindisfarne Castle and various Lutyens-designed houses including The Deanery in Sonning. \n\nAt that time golf and racing served as its main content, as well as the property coverage, initially of manorial estates, which is still such a large part of the magazine. Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the late Queen Mother, used to appear frequently on its front cover. Now the magazine covers a range of subjects in depth, from gardens and gardening to country house architecture, fine art and books, and property to rural issues, luxury products and interiors. \n\nThe frontispiece of each issue usually features a portrait photograph of a young woman of society, or, on occasion, a man of society.\n\nIn 2016, in its 119th year, Country Life was the subject of a three-part documentary series made by Spun Gold and which aired on BBC Two on consecutive Friday nights in March. The magazine has also celebrated its best-ever selling issue - the double issue from Christmas 2015 - and a 6th ABC increase in a row, which is an achievement no other weekly magazine publishing original content can claim. \n\nIn 1997, the centenary of the magazine was celebrated by a special issue, the publishing of a book by Sir Roy Strong, the airing of a BBC2 TV programme on a year in the life of the magazine, and staging a Gold Medal winning garden at the Chelsea Flower Show. In 1999, the magazine launched a new website.\n\nIn 2007, the magazine celebrated its 110th anniversary with a special souvenir issue on 4 January. Starting on Wednesday 7 May 2008 the magazine is issued each Wednesday, having been on sale each Thursday for the past 111 years, with the earlier day being achieved using electronic publishing technology.\n\nThe first several dozen pages of each issue are devoted to colour advertisements for upmarket residential property, which are one of the best-known attractions of the magazine, and popular with everyone from the super rich looking for a country house or estate to those who can only aspire to own such a property.\n\nThe magazine covers the pleasures and joys of rural life. It is primarily concerned with rural communities and their environments as well as the concerns of country dwellers and landowners and has a diverse readership which, although mainly UK based is also international. Much of its success has historically been built on its coverage of country house architecture and gardening at a time when the architectural press largely ignored this building type. An extensive photographic archive has resulted, now of great importance to architectural historians. \n\nThe other rural pursuits and interests covered include hunting, shooting, farming, equestrian news and gardening and there are regular news and opinion pieces as well as a firm engagement with rural politics. There are reviews of books, food and wine, art and architecture (also many offers) and antiques and crafts. Illustrative material includes the \"Tottering-by-Gently\" cartoon by Annie Tempest. The property section claims to have more prime agents than anywhere else. In addition. monthly luxury and interiors sections offer readers some informed ideas about the latest in jewellery, style and travel, and interiors. \n\nRecent feature articles have included Charles, Prince of Wales guest-editing an issue of \"Country Life\" in 2013, a historic revelation which revealed the true face of Shakespeare for the first time in 2015, and in 2016 an exclusive on where the Great Fire of London really began in 1666. There was a special commemorative issue in June 2016 on the occasion of the Queen's 90th birthday, and a Best of Britain celebrating the very best of what the United Kingdom has to offer, from craftsmen to landscapes.\n\nIn March 2016, \"Country Life\" was featured in a three-part documentary series produced by Spun Gold which aired on BBC2 called \"Land of Hope and Glory, British Country Life\". The films sought to show some elements of modern rural life which although feature often in \"Country Life\" magazine, are rarely seen in the mass media. \n\nTopics covered included the beauty of the countryside and the centuries and traditions of the people who live there as well as some of the challenges faced by those who live and work exclusively on the land, from property owners to farmers and those employed in country pursuits.\n\n\nDeputy editors:\n\nArchitectural editors [dates as architectural writer]:\n\nGardens editors:\n\n(earlier versions cited Fred Whitsey as a gardens editor, but he was a distinguished contributor only,\nbeing in fact the Editor of sister publication Popular Gardening)\n\n\nStaff architectural photographers:\n\n\n\n"}

Others include Le Corbusier's \"Vers une architecture\", and Victor Papanek's \"Design for the real world\" (1972).\n\nIn a 'principles' approach to design theory, the De Stijl movement promoted a geometrical abstract, \"ascetic\" form of purism that was limited to functionality. This modernist attitude underpinned the Bauhaus movement. Principles were drawn up for design that were applicable to all areas of modern aesthetics.\n\nFor an introduction to the philosophy of design see the article by Per Galle at the Royal Danish Academy.\n\nAn example of early design science was Altshuller's \"Theory of inventive problem solving\", known as TRIZ, from Russia in the 1940s. Herbert Simon's 1969 \"The sciences of the artificial\" began a more scientific basis to the study of design. Since then the further development of fields such as design methods, design research, design science and design thinking has promoted a wider understanding of design theory.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "706520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=706520", "title": "Elfdalian", "text": "Elfdalian\n\nElfdalian or Övdalian (' or ' in Elfdalian, ' or ' in Swedish) is a North Germanic language spoken by up to 3,000 people who live or have grown up in the parish of Älvdalen (\"\"), which is located in the southeastern part of Älvdalen Municipality in northern Dalarna, Sweden.\n\nLike all other modern North Germanic languages, Elfdalian developed from Old Norse, a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and inhabitants of their overseas settlements during the Viking Age until about 1300. It developed in relative isolation since the Middle Ages and is considered to have remained closer to Old Norse than the other Dalecarlian dialects.\n\nTraditionally regarded as a Swedish dialect, Elfdalian is a separate language by the standard of mutual intelligibility.\n\nElfdalian belongs to the Northern branch/Upper Siljan branch of the Dalecarlian dialects or vernaculars, which in their turn evolved from Old Norse, from which Dalecarlian vernaculars might have split as early as in the eighth or ninth century, i.e., approximately when the North Germanic languages split into Western and Eastern branches. \nElfdalian (and other Dalecarlian language varieties) is traditionally placed among the East Scandinavian languages, together with Swedish and Danish, based on a number of features that Elfdalian has in common with them. According to Lars Levander, the West Scandinavian features that simultaneously do occur in Elfdalian are archaic traits that once were common in many Scandinavian dialects and have been preserved in the most conservative tongues east and west of Kölen.\n\nArchaisms:\n\nInnovations and unique developments:\n\nElfdalian is comparable to Swedish and Norwegian in number and quality of vowels, but also has nasal vowels. It has retained the Old Norse dental, velar and labial voiced fricatives. Alveolo-palatal affricate consonants occur in all (Swedish \"\", north of Siljan) dialects. The realization of ‹r› is [r], an apical alveolar trill. Unlike many variants of Norwegian and Swedish, Elfdalian does not assimilate /rt, rd, rs, rn, rl/ into retroflex consonants. Stress is generally on the first syllable of a word.\n\nNasal vowels are a unique feature of Elfdalian, having been lost from all other descendants of Old Norse at some point of their history. They have several origins, belonging to different layers of history, but most involve loss of a nasal consonant, with lengthening and nasalisation of a preceding vowel.\n\nIn common with some other Dalecarlian vernaculars spoken north of the Lake Siljan, Elfdalian retains numerous old grammatical and phonological features that have not changed considerably since Old Norse, and it is considered to be the most conservative and best preserved vernacular within the Dalecarlian branch. Having developed in relative isolation since the Middle Ages, quite a few linguistic innovations are also present in the language.\n\nElfdalian has a morphological structure inherited from its Old Norse ancestor. Verbs are conjugated according to person and number and nouns have four cases, similar to modern Icelandic and German. The Old Norse three-gender system has been retained. Like the other North Germanic languages, nouns have definite and indefinite forms rather than a separate definite article (as in English). The length of the root syllable plays a major role in the Elfdalian declensional and conjugational system. The declension of \"\", \"wolf\" (long-syllabic, strong masculine noun) was as follows in what is sometimes called \"Classic Elfdalian\" (as described by Levander 1909):\n\nMany speakers retain the distinct dative case, used especially after prepositions and also certain verbs (such as ', \"help\"). The distinction between nominative and accusative has been lost in full nouns, and the inherited genitive been replaced by new forms created by attaching ' to the dative (see Dahl & Koptjevskaja-Tamm 2005), a trend well underway even in Classic Elfdalian.\n\nUnlike other Swedish vernaculars, the syntax of Elfdalian was investigated in the early 20th century (Levander 1909). Although Elfdalian syntax has attracted increased attention, a majority of its syntactic elements are still unresearched. In May–June 2007, a group of linguists from the pan-Scandinavian NORMS network conducted fieldwork in Älvdalen especially aimed at investigating the syntactic properties of the language.\n\nPresented with the help of generative syntax, the following features have been identified:\n\n\nThis has recently been studied more closely from a generative perspective by Rosenkvist (2007).\n\nOther syntactic properties are negative concord, stylistic inversion, long distance reflexives, verb controlled datives, agent-verb word order in coordinated clauses with deleted subjects, etc. Some of these properties are archaic features that existed in Old Swedish, whereas others are innovations, but none of them have been studied in any detail.\n\nIn Älvdalen, Germanic runes survived in use longer than anywhere else. The last record of the Elfdalian Runes is from 1929; these runes are a variant of the Dalecarlian runes. Älvdalen can be said to have had its own alphabet during the 17th and 18th century.\n\nDue to the great phonetic differences between Swedish and Elfdalian, the use of Swedish orthography for Elfdalian has been unpredictable and varied, e.g. as applied in the Prytz's play from 1622, which contains long passages in Elfdalian, or in the Elfdalian material published in the periodical \"Skansvakten\".\n\nA first attempt to create a separate Elfdalian orthography was made in 1999 by Bengt Åkerberg. Åkerberg's orthography was applied in some books and used in language courses. This orthography is based on Loka dialect and is highly phonetic, involving a great deal of diacritics (Sapir 2006).\n\nIn March 2005, a uniform standard orthography for Elfdalian was presented by (lit. \"Let us confer\"), The Elfdalian Language Council, and accepted by ' (lit. \"Let us speak Dalecarlian\"), The Organization for the Preservation of Elfdalian. The new orthography has already been applied by Björn Rehnström in his book ' 'Three Bears from Älvdalen' published in 2007. Råðdjärum's orthography was also used in Bo Westling's translation of 's \"The Little Prince\", \".\n\nThe Elfdalian alphabet consists of the following letters:\n\nBesides letters occurring in the Swedish alphabet, Elfdalian has letters with ogonek, denoting nasal vowels: Ąą, Ęę, Įį, Ǫǫ, Ųų, Y̨y̨ and Ą̊ą̊. Additionally, it uses the letter eth (, ) for the voiced dental fricative.\n\nAs of 2009, Elfdalian had around 2,000 speakers and is in danger of language death. However, it is possible that it will receive an official status as a minority language in Sweden, which would entail numerous protections and encourage its use in schools and by writers and artists. The Swedish Parliament was due to address this issue in 2007, but apparently has not yet done so. The Council of Europe has urged the Swedish government to reconsider the status of Elfdalian on four different occasions, most recently in October 2011. The Committee of Experts now encourages the Swedish authorities to investigate the status of Elfdalian through an independent scientific study.\n\n', The Organization for the Preservation of Elfdalian, was established in 1984 with the aim of preserving and documenting the Elfdalian language. In 2005, ' launched a process aimed at bringing about an official recognition of Elfdalian as a language by the Swedish authorities.\n\n', The Elfdalian Language Committee was established in August 2004 within ', its first task being to create a new standard orthography for Elfdalian. In March 2005, the new orthography created by ' was accepted by the ' at their annual meeting. \" consists of five permanent members: linguist Östen Dahl, dialectologist Gunnar Nyström, teacher Inga-Britt Petersson, linguist and coordinator of the committee Dr. Yair Sapir, and linguist Lars Steensland.\n\nAs an initiative from \"\" to encourage children to speak Elfdalian, all school children in Älvdalen who finish the ninth grade and can prove that they can speak Elfdalian receive a 6,000 SEK stipend.\n\nAn online version of Lars Steensland’s 2010 Elfdalian dictionary was published in September 2015.\n\nIn March 2016, Swedish Radio reported that the Älvdalen City Council had decided that, starting in autumn 2016, the local kindergarten would operate solely through the medium of Elfdalian.\n\nA new genus \"Elfdaliana\" of deep-sea nudibranch molluscs has been named recently after the Elfdalian language in reference to evolutionary basal characters of the new genus never before reported for this family just as Elfdalian preserves ancestral features of Old Norse.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1659344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1659344", "title": "Fenqing", "text": "Fenqing\n\nFenqing (), or FQ (abbreviation), which is itself an abbreviation for \"Fennu Qingnian\" (), means literally \"angry youth\". It mainly refers to Chinese youth who display a high level of Chinese nationalism. This term first appeared in Hong Kong in the 1970s, referring to those young people who were not satisfied with Chinese society and sought reform. It has now evolved into a term used predominantly in Internet slang. Whether \"fenqing\" is derogatory or not usually depends on the person. Chinese critics often refer to them using the homophone characters \"\" which are pronounced identically but translate to \"shit-youth\". This is often changed further to \"fènfèn\" () as a derogatory nickname.\n\nThe phenomenon of \"fenqing\" arose after the \"reform and opening up\" of the Chinese government, during the period of fast economic development that occurred in China. Some people argue that \"fenqing\" are a natural reaction to recent neoconservatism in Japan and the neoconservatism in the United States. \"Fenqing\" and these foreign neo-conservative elements intensely dislike each other, but all of them share certain similarities: distrust of foreign powers, support for the military and boundary disputes, etc. However, \"fenqing\" are not to be confused with Chinese neoconservatives, who espouse a more pragmatic and gradualist approach to political reforms and favor the development of an \"East Asian Community\" with Japan and Korea, an idea that is anathema to the \"fenqing\" \n\nAs a group, \"fenqing\" are very diverse in their opinions. However, they are usually nationalistic and patriotic, are often left-wing in political ideology, and tend to defend Mao Zedong's controversial actions during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. The \"fenqing\" are very much concerned with political issues, especially in domestic policy relating to Tibet and foreign policy relating to Japan, Taiwan, or the United States.\n\nThey often harbour negative attitudes towards Japan due to the invasion and occupation of China by Imperial Japan, and support aggressive political stances towards Japan. For example, many believe that the Japanese government's apologies for Japanese war crimes are insincere and inadequate (some even believe no apologies will ever be adequate). More recent incidents, such a former Japanese prime minister's patronage of the Yasukuni Shrine, territorial disputes surrounding the Senkaku Islands (known as Diaoyu in China), and the revisions of history textbooks by uyoku dantai (Japanese right-wing extremists), lead these young people to conclude that the Japanese government is again seeking to expand militarily. These anti-Japanese sentiments are not necessarily only directed against the Japanese government and military, but often fiercely towards the Japanese culture, economy, and people.\n\n\"Fenqing\" also refers to \"20-somethings often use the Internet to publicly express their views on politics and society.\"\n\nSome support Chinese boycotts of Japanese products, for historical reasons and in response to the events described above. They may dislike Chinese Japanophiles and other Chinese who are more Westernized and free-market oriented, calling them Hanjian (\"Chinese traitors\"). \n\nSome \"fenqing\" view Taiwan as a part of China, and believe that Taiwan independence should be prevented by any means necessary. Many tend to consider war to be feasible, if not immediately necessary. A few may even favor the use of nuclear weapons against Taiwan.\n\nSome view American or Western attention to issues such as human rights, Falun Gong, Tibet, etc. as attempts to undermine the rise of China. Most support the ideal of democracy, but view Western attempts to spread democracy as self-serving, subversive propaganda. However, only a few truly believe in communism.\n\nIn May,1999, China's embassy's was bombed in the Republic of Yugoslavia by American army. This event irritated the “angry youth” and they made remonstration to it. Chinese hackers attacked many American websites. In the demonstrations, the most eye-catching slogans calling for a boycott included ‘Burn all McDonald’s in China’ and ‘Damage American intellectual property by practical action: free provision of pirated software’. After the Hainan Island incident in April 2001, hackers in both countries began their fight again. Most of the “angry youth” believe that the United States doesn’t want China to develop.\n\nSome have the view that the Chinese Communist government is invincible and justified at all cases. They may unconditionally defend all action by the Communist Party of China, or by Mao Zedong against countries they feel that \"threaten China's rise\". However, others simply defend the Chinese government because they believe it to be better than an alternative government which they believe would be dominated by Westerners.\n\nSome are very passionate about irredentist claims. In addition to the official claims made by the People's Republic of China, such as Taiwan, Arunachal Pradesh, the Senkaku Islands, and the South China Sea Islands, some \"fenqing\" also make irredentist claims to Outer Mongolia, Tuva, Outer Manchuria, the Hukawng Valley of northern Myanmar, parts of Central Asia east of Lake Balkhash, Bhutan, Ladakh, and Sikkim.\n\nThey generally abhor political corruption within the government and government organizations. Many \"fenqing\" care greatly about the poor and believe they are the voice of the poor, advocating social security policies, and despise what they call the \"elites\" of China. Most \"fenqing\" are highly skeptical about the free market and often blame it as the source of corruption, social inequalities and the weakening of the central government. They also generally perceive the government as being too nice or ineffectual in a variety of issues, such as the Taiwan Straits, relations with Japan or the U.S., and Tibetan and Xinjiang independence. For some their role models are Lu Xun and the activists of the May Fourth Movement. Some \"fenqing\" believe if Lu Xun were still alive today, he would continue fiercely criticizing the government.\n\nThe Chinese Communist party does not officially espouse Han chauvinism. It espouses Zhonghua minzu nationalism, which emphasizes assimilation into a modern nation of multiethnic origins, and emphasizes the Zhonghua nation's modern-era struggles against the \"Imperialists\": the West and Japan, and the historical multiethnic Zhonghua nation's insistence on unity under a single imperial state.\n\nMilitant nationalist websites, whether Zhonghua or Han, are often suppressed by the government because they appear to be elevating popular discussions into political levels. The government simply has a habit of clamping down on any kind of political discussions to prevent them from becoming ideologies that can replace official Zhonghua-Marxo-Capitalism.\n\nZhonghua nationalist websites tend to style themselves as \"ultra-left socialist\", venerating Mao as an anti-colonial icon over his capitalist successors, and identify Japan and US as their prime enemies, and focus very heavily on the goal of militarily invading Taiwan. Uyghurs and Tibetans are discussed as if they are mainly law-abiding Zhonghua citizens, with a minority elements instigated by overseas \"separatist exiles\".\n\n"}

It is typically made of weather-resistant materials such as aluminium which does not rust. The oldest surviving examples of garden furniture were found in the gardens of Pompeii.\n\n\nGarden furniture is often sold as a \"patio set\" consisting of a table, four or six chairs, and a (parasol). A picnic table is used for the purpose of eating a meal outdoors. Long chairs, referred to as \"chaise longue\", are also common items. Recently seating furniture has been used for conversation areas using items like couches.\n\nThe British 'garden parasol' or American 'garden umbrella' is the term for a specialised type of umbrella designed to provide shade from the sun. Parasols are either secured in a weighted base or a built-in mount in the paving. Some are movable around outdoor tables and seating, others centred through a hole mid-table.\n\nPatio heaters are used to enable people to sit outside at night or in cold weather. They can be permanently mounted on eaves and patio roofs, or portable and self-supporting. They can operate on electricity, propane, bottled butane (small units), or natural gas. The latter can be plumbed into permanent locations or attached to 'quick-connect' outlets.\n\nModular outdoor fire pits and portable fire bowls have become widely available in many materials to extend outdoor living. The tall clay \"Chimeneas\" of North America are an example.\n\nCurrent garden accessories include items like birdbaths, plant stands, planter boxes and trellises to add detail to an outdoor space.\n\nThe most commonly sold types of patio sets are made of plastic, wood, aluminium, wicker, and wrought iron.\nWooden garden furniture can suffer through exposure to the elements and therefore needs to be periodically treated. Teak is a commonly used material for outdoor furniture. It naturally contains silica, which makes it resistant to fungal decay, many of the effects of water (such as rot, swelling and warping), as well as chemicals. It is also resistant to fire, acid and alkalis.\n\nWhen Teak weathers it loses its original look but gains a majestic, almost silver glow. Many owners prefer the aged look of teak and because of its resistance to rotting and infestation, it can be appreciated without upkeep. \nAluminium garden furniture is robust and long-lasting. However, if the protective coating is compromised it will corrode. Plastic garden furniture is naturally waterproof, so it can be left out year-round. Waterproof outdoor furniture pieces are usually made of materials such as Mahogany, Teak, Cast Aluminum, PE Wicker, Plastic and PVC Wicker. These materials are durable and can withstand the elements of wind, rain and sun exposure.\n\nWicker outdoor living furniture was originally made from the stems of any one of 600 species of palms found in tropical regions all over the world. The palm stems were tightly woven into interlocking panels, and formed into the desired structure. Now, most modern wicker furniture is made from synthetic resin, increasing the life expectancy and reducing manufacturing costs. Today's resin furniture is often made of recycled plastic and incredibly durable, usually carrying warranties of 20 years or longer. It can be moulded to resemble real wood or wicker.\n\n"}

{"id": "1745843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1745843", "title": "Germanic strong verb", "text": "Germanic strong verb\n\nIn the Germanic languages, a strong verb is a verb that marks its past tense by means of changes to the stem vowel (ablaut). The majority of the remaining verbs form the past tense by means of a dental suffix (e.g. \"-ed\" in English), and are known as \"weak verbs\".\n\nIn modern English, strong verbs include \"sing\" (present \"I sing\", past \"I sang\", past participle \"I have sung\") and \"drive\" (present \"I drive\", past \"I drove\", past participle \"I have driven\"), as opposed to weak verbs such as \"open\" (present \"I open\", past \"I opened\", past participle \"I have opened\"). Not all verbs with a change in the stem vowel are strong verbs, however; they may also be irregular weak verbs such as \"bring, brought, brought\" or \"keep, kept, kept\". The key distinction is that most strong verbs have their origin in the sound system of Indo-European, whereas weak verbs use a dental ending (in English usually \"-ed\" or \"-t\") that was introduced later, during the development of the Germanic languages.\n\nThe \"strong\" vs. \"weak\" terminology was coined by the German philologist Jacob Grimm in the 1800s, and the terms \"strong verb\" and \"weak verb\" are direct translations of the original German terms \"starkes Verb\" and \"schwaches Verb\".\n\nStrong verbs have their origin in the ancestral Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language. In PIE, vowel alternations called \"ablaut\" were frequent and occurred in many types of word, not only in verbs. The vowel that appeared in any given syllable is called its \"grade\". In many words, the basic vowel was *\"e\" (e-grade), but, depending on what syllable of a word the stress fell on in PIE, this could change to *\"o\" (o-grade), or disappear altogether (zero grade). Both \"e\" and \"o\" could also be lengthened to \"ē\" and \"ō\" (lengthened grade). Thus ablaut turned short \"e\" into the following sounds:\n\nAs the Germanic languages developed from PIE, they dramatically altered the Indo-European verbal system. PIE verbs had no tense, but could occur in three distinct \"aspects\": the aorist, present and perfect aspect. The aorist originally denoted events without any attention to the specifics or ongoing nature of the event (\"ate\", perfective aspect). The present implied some attention to such details and was thus used for ongoing actions (\"is eating\", imperfective aspect). The perfect was a stative verb, and referred not to the event itself, but to the state that resulted from the event (\"has eaten\" or \"is/has been eaten\"). In Germanic, the aorist eventually disappeared and merged with the present, while the perfect took on a past tense meaning and became a general past tense. The strong Germanic present thus descends from the PIE present, while the past descends from the PIE perfect. The inflexions of PIE verbs also changed considerably.\n\nIn the course of these changes, the different root-vowels caused by PIE ablaut became markers of tense. Thus in Germanic, *\"bʰer-\" became in the infinitive (e-grade); *\"bar\" in the past singular (o-grade); *\"bērun\" in the past plural (ē-grade); and *\"buranaz\" in the past participle (zero-grade).\n\nIn Proto-Germanic, the system of strong verbs was largely regular. As sound changes took place in the development of Germanic from PIE, the vowels of strong verbs became more varied, but usually in predictable ways, so in most cases all of the principal parts of a strong verb of a given class could be reliably predicted from the infinitive. Thus we can reconstruct Common Germanic as having seven coherent classes of strong verbs. This system continued largely intact in the first attested Germanic languages, notably Gothic, Old English, Old High German and Old Norse.\n\nGermanic strong verbs, mostly deriving directly from PIE, are slowly being supplanted by or transformed into weak verbs.\n\nAs well as developing the strong verb system, Germanic also went on to develop two other classes of verbs: the weak verbs and a third, much smaller, class known as the preterite-present verbs, which are continued in the English auxiliary verbs, e.g. \"can/could, shall/should, may/might, must\". Weak verbs originally derived from other types of word in PIE and originally occurred only in the present aspect. They did not have a perfect aspect, meaning that they came to lack a past tense in Germanic once the perfect had become the past. Not having a past tense at all, they obviously also had no vowel alternations between present and past. To compensate for this, a new type of past tense was eventually created for these verbs by adding a \"-d-\" or \"-t-\" suffix to the stem. This is why only strong verbs have vowel alternations: their past tense forms descend from the original PIE perfect aspect, while the past tense forms of weak verbs were created later.\n\nThe development of weak verbs in Germanic meant that the strong verb system ceased to be productive: no new strong verbs developed. Practically all new verbs were weak, and few new strong verbs were created. Over time, strong verbs tended to become weak in some languages, so that the total number of strong verbs in the languages was constantly decreasing.\n\nThe coherence of the strong verb system is still present in modern German, Dutch, Icelandic and Faroese. For example, in German and Dutch, strong verbs are consistently marked with a past participle in \"-en\", while weak verbs have a past participle in \"-t\" in German and \"-t\" or \"-d\" in Dutch. In English, however, the original regular strong conjugations have largely disintegrated, with the result that in modern English grammar, a distinction between strong and weak verbs is less useful than a distinction between \"regular\" and \"irregular\" verbs. Thus the verb \"to help\", which used to be conjugated \"help-holp-holpen\", is now \"help-helped-helped\". The reverse phenomenon, whereby a weak verb becomes strong by analogy, is rare (one example in American English, considered informal by some authorities, is \"sneak, snuck, snuck.\" Another is the humorous past tense of \"sneeze\" which is \"snoze\").\n\nSome verbs, which might be termed \"semi-strong\", have formed a weak preterite but retained the strong participle, or rarely vice versa. This type of verb is most common in Dutch:\nExamples in English are \"swell, swelled, swollen\"\n\nAs an example of the conjugation of a strong verb, we may take the Old English class 2 verb , \"to offer\" (cf. English \"bid\").\n\nThis has the following forms:\n\nWhile the inflections are more or less regular, the vowel changes in the stem are not predictable without an understanding of the Indo-European \"ablaut\" system, and students have to learn four or five \"principal parts\" by heart – the number depends on whether one considers the third-person singular present tense as a principal part. If we choose to use all five, then for this verb they are \"bēodan, bīett, bēad, budon, boden\". The list of five principal parts includes:\n\nStrictly speaking, in this verb \"ablaut\" causes only a threefold distinction: parts 1 and 2 are from the e-grade, part 3 from the o-grade, and parts 4 and 5 from the zero grade. The other two distinctions are caused by different kinds of regressive metaphony: part 2, when it is distinct at all, is always derived from part 1 by Umlaut. In some verbs, part 5 is a discrete ablaut grade, but in this class 2 verb it is derived from part 4 by an a-mutation.\n\nGermanic strong verbs are commonly divided into 7 classes, based on the type of vowel alternation. This is in turn based mostly on the type of consonants that follow the vowel. The Anglo-Saxon scholar Henry Sweet gave names to the seven classes:\n\nI. The \"drive\" conjugation\n\nII. The \"choose\" conjugation\n\nIII. The \"bind\" conjugation\n\nIV. The \"bear\" conjugation\n\nV. The \"give\" conjugation\n\nVI. The \"shake\" conjugation\n\nVII. The \"fall\" conjugation\n\nHowever, they are normally referred to by numbers alone.\n\nIn Proto-Germanic, the common ancestor of the Germanic languages, the strong verbs were still mostly regular. The classes continued largely intact in Old English and the other older historical Germanic languages: Gothic, Old High German and Old Norse. However, idiosyncrasies of the phonological changes led to a growing number of subgroups. Also, once the ablaut system ceased to be productive, there was a decline in the speakers' awareness of the regularity of the system. That led to anomalous forms and the six big classes lost their cohesion. This process has advanced furthest in English, but in some other modern Germanic languages (such as German), the seven classes are still fairly well preserved and recognisable.\n\nThe reverse process in which anomalies are eliminated and subgroups reunited by the force of analogy is called \"levelling\", and it can be seen at various points in the history of the verb classes.\n\nIn the later Middle Ages, German, Dutch and English eliminated a great part of the old distinction between the vowels of the singular and plural preterite forms. The new uniform preterite could be based on the vowel of the old preterite singular, on the old plural, or sometimes on the participle. In English, the distinction remains in the verb \"to be\": \"I was, we were\". In Dutch, it remains in the verbs of classes 4 & 5 but only in vowel length: \"ik brak\" (I broke - short \"a\"), \"wij braken\" (we broke - long \"ā\"). In German and Dutch it also remains in the present tense of the preterite presents. In Limburgish there is a little more left. E.g. the preterite of to help is \"(weer) hólpe\" for the plural but either \"(ich) halp\" or \"(ich) hólp\" for the singular.\n\nIn the process of development of English, numerous sound changes and analogical developments have fragmented the classes to the extent that most of them no longer have any coherence: only classes 1, 3 and 4 still have significant subclasses that follow uniform patterns.\n\nFor a treatment of the classes one at a time showing how the forms evolved in the various Germanic languages, one can consult an older version of this Wikipedia article.\n\nBefore looking at the seven classes individually, the general developments that affected all of them will be noted. The following phonological changes that occurred between Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Germanic are relevant for the discussion of the \"ablaut\" system.\n\n\nFor the purpose of explanation, the different verb forms can be grouped by the vowel they receive, and given a \"principal part\" number:\n\n\nIn West Germanic, the 2nd person singular past indicative deviates from this scheme and uses the vowel of Part 3. Its ending is also an \"-i\" of unclear origin, rather than the expected \"-t\" < PIE *\"-th₂e\" of North and East Germanic, which suggests that this state of affairs is an innovation.\n\nThe first 5 classes appear to continue the following PIE ablaut grades:\n\nExcept for the apparent ē-grade in part 3 of classes 4 and 5, these are in fact straightforward survivals of the PIE situation.\n\nThe standard pattern of PIE is represented in Germanic by classes 1, 2 and 3, with the present (part 1) in the e-grade, past indicative singular (part 2) in the o-grade, and remaining past (part 3) and past participle (part 4) in the zero grade. The differences between classes 1, 2, and 3 arise from semivowels coming after the root vowel, as shown in the table below.\n\nAs can be seen, the e-grade in part 1 and o-grade in part 2 are shared by all of these five classes. The difference between them is in parts 3 and 4:\n\n\nClass 6 appears in Germanic with the vowels \"a\" and \"ō\". PIE sources of the \"a\" vowel included \"*he\", \"*o\", and a laryngeal between consonants; possibly in some cases the \"a\" may be an example of the a-grade of ablaut, though the existence of such a grade is controversial. It is not clear exactly how the \"ō\" is to be derived from an earlier ablaut alternant in PIE, but believable sources include contraction of the reduplicant syllable in PIE *\"h\"-initial verbs, or o-grades of verbs with interconsonantal laryngeal. In any event, within Germanic the resulting \"a\" ~ \"ō\" behaved as just another type of vowel alternation.\n\nIn Proto-Germanic, this resulted in the following vowel patterns:\n\n\nThe forms of class 7 were very different and did not neatly reflect the standard ablaut grades found in the first 5 classes. Instead of (or in addition to) vowel alternations, this class displayed reduplication of the first consonants of the stem in the past tense.\n\nIt is generally believed that reduplication was once a feature of all Proto-Indo-European perfect-aspect forms. It was then lost in most verbs by Proto-Germanic times due to haplology. However, verbs with vowels that did not fit in the existing pattern of alternation retained their reduplication. Class 7 is thus not really one class, but can be split into several subclasses based on the original structure of the root, much like the first 5 classes. The first three subclasses are parallel with classes 1 to 3 but with \"e\" replaced with \"a\": 7a is parallel to class 1, class 7b to class 2, and class 7c to class 3.\n\nThe following is a general picture of the Proto-Germanic situation as reconstructed by Jay Jasanoff. Earlier reconstructions of the 7th class were generally based mostly on Gothic evidence.\n\nThe situation sketched above did not survive intact into any of the Germanic languages. It was changed significantly, but rather differently in Gothic on one hand, and in the Northwest Germanic languages on the other.\n\nReduplication was retained in Gothic, with the vowel \"ai\" inserted. However, as in all other strong verbs, consonant alternations were almost entirely eliminated in favour of the voiceless alternants. The present and past singular stem was extended to the plural, leaving the reduplication as the only change in the stem between the two tenses. The vowel alternation was retained in a few class 7d verbs, but eliminated otherwise by generalising the present tense stem throughout the paradigm. The verb \"lētan\" \"to allow\" retained the past form \"lailōt\" with ablaut, while \"slēpan\" \"to sleep\" had the past tense form \"saislēp\" without it. The form \"saizlēp\", with Verner-law alternation, is occasionally found as well, but it was apparently a relic formation with no other examples of alternation elsewhere.\n\nIn the Northwest Germanic languages, which include all modern surviving Germanic languages, class 7 was drastically remodelled. Reduplication was almost eliminated, except for a few relics, and new ablaut patterns were introduced. Many attempts were made to explain this development. Jasanoff posits the following series of events within the history of Northwest Germanic:\n\n\nStages 4 and 5 were not quite complete by the time of the earliest written records. While most class 7 verbs had replaced reduplication with ablaut entirely, several vestigial remains of reduplication are found throughout the North and West Germanic languages. Various other changes occurred later in the individual languages. *e in class 7c was replaced by *ē (> ia) in Old High German and Old Dutch, but by *eu (> ēo) in Old English.\n\nThe following \"Late Proto-Northwest-Germanic\" can be reconstructed as descendants of the earlier Proto-Germanic forms given above. Note that ē became ā in Northwest Germanic.\n\nThe Proto-Germanic language most likely used more than 500 strong roots. Although some roots are speculative, the language can be reconstructed with the following strong roots based on the work of Elmar Seebold (1970), Robert Mailhammer (2007) and Guus Kroonen (2013).\nProto-Germanic had aorist-present roots, a remnant of the aorist aspect found in Proto-Indo-European. These verbs used the former aorist as a present tense form. The aorist had a zero-grade vowel, like parts 3 and 4 of the perfect. So these verbs have an anomalous vowel in the present tense, they decline regularly otherwise.\n\n\nBeing the oldest Germanic language with any significant literature, it is not surprising that Gothic preserves the strong verbs best. However, some changes still occurred:\n\n\nAlso, long \"ī\" was spelled in Gothic.\n\nChanges that occurred in the West Germanic languages:\n\n\nThe following changes occurred from West Germanic to Old English:\n\nThe following are the paradigms for Old English:\nWith j-presents (and other anomalies):\nThe verb \"to stand\" follows class 6, but has an anomalous loss of its \"-n-\" in the past:\nSome relics of class 7 reduplication remain in Old English, mostly in texts from Anglia (infinitive and past singular shown):\n\nChanges that occurred from Old English to Modern English:\n\n\nIn Modern English, generally speaking, the verb classes have disintegrated and are not easily recognisable.\n<br>For the principal parts of all English strong verbs see: \n\"Wiktionary appendix: Irregular English verbs\".\n\nThe following modern English verbs resemble the original paradigm:\nClass 1 is still recognisable, as in most other Germanic languages. The modern past is taken from either the old past singular (\"ride rode ridden\") or the old past plural (\"bite bit bitten\"). In the case of \"shine shone shone\", the past participle has also assimilated to the past singular.\n\nClass 1 verbs in modern English (excluding derived verbs such as \"abide\" and \"override\") are \"bide, bite, chide, drive, hide, ride, rise, rive, shine, shit/shite, shrive, slide, smite, stride, strike, strive, thrive, write\".\n\nHowever, although most of these verbs have uniformity in their infinitive vowel, they no longer form a coherent class in further inflected forms – for example, \"bite\" (\"bit, bitten\"), \"ride\" (\"rode, ridden\"), \"shine\" (\"shone, shone\"), and \"strike\" (\"struck, struck/stricken\", with \"struck\" and \"stricken\" used in different meanings) all show different patterns from one another – but \"bide, drive, ride, rise, smite, stride, strive, write\" do form a (more or less) coherent subclass. Most of these verbs are descended from Old English class 1 verbs. However:\n\nIn American English, the past tense of the verb \"dive\" is usually \"dove\", as though it is in Class 1, but the past participle is still \"dived\".\n\nClass 2 has become a small group and has become rather irregular. It includes \"choose, cleave, fly, freeze\" and \"shoot\" (whose usual passive participle is \"shot\" rather than ). The verb \"bid\" (in the sense of \"to offer\") was in Class 2, but now the past and past participle are \"bid\". The obsolete verb is now used only as the passive participle \"forlorn\". This group does not form a coherent class, as each verb has different irregularities from each other verb.\n\nClass 3 in English is still fairly large and regular. The past is formed either from the old past singular or from the past plural. Many of the verbs have two past forms, one of which may be dialectal or archaic (\"begin, drink, ring, shrink, sing, slink, spin, spring, stink, swing, swim\" and \"wring\"). However, there are some anomalies. The class 3 verbs in modern English are:\nEnglish \"fling\" does not go back to Old English, and may be a loan-word from Norse. It seems to have adopted class 3 forms by analogy with \"cling\" etc. Similarly \"ring, string\".\n\nThe verb \"come\" is anomalous in all the West Germanic languages because it originally began with \"qu-\", and the subsequent loss of the \"w\" sound coloured the vowel of the present stem.\nAlso anomalous:\n\nIn Modern English, regular class 4 verbs have all kept the \"–n\" in the participle, though eliminating the medial \"e\" after \"r\", this class exhibits near homogeneity of vowel pattern:\nbut several verbs have archaic preterites that preserve the \"a\" of Middle English (\"bare, brake, gat, sware, tare\", and \"spake\" or Scots \"spak\"). The preterite of Middle English \"comen\" was either \"cam\" or \"com\" (or with \"-en\" in the plural).\n\nClass 4 verbs in English (not including derivatives such as \"beget\") are \"bear, break, get, shear, speak, steal, swear, tear, tread, wake, weave\"; and without the \"-n\" and of irregular vowel progression: \"come\". \"Get, speak, tread\" and \"weave\" were originally of class 5, whereas \"swear\" was originally class 6. \"Wake\" was also originally class 6, and in fact retains the \"a\" of the present tense – the preterite \"woke\" (Middle English \"wook\") only conforms to the modern class 4 preterite, not to the historic class 4 preterite in \"a\".\n\nIn Modern English this group has lost all group cohesion.\nClass 5 verbs in Modern English:\n\"bid\" (in the sense of \"to command\" or \"to invite\"), \"eat, forbid, give, lie\" (= lie down), \"see, sit\". The verb \"quethe\" is only used poetically now. \"Get, speak, tread\", and \"weave\", which come from Class 5 verbs, are now Class 4.\n\nThe verb \"\" comes from a Class 2 verb in Old English. The preterite can be \"forbad\" or \"forbade\"\n\nThe preterite \"ate\" is pronounced \"et\" in some British dialects.\n\nAlthough the verb \"to be\" is suppletive and highly irregular, its past follows the pattern of a class 5 strong verb, with grammatischer Wechsel (the alternation of \"s\" and \"r\" in \"was\" versus \"were\"), and has uniquely retained the singular/plural distinction of both ablaut grade and consonant in the modern languages. Old English: \"\", English: \"was/were\". For full paradigms and historical explanations see Indo-European copula.\n\nClass 6 has disintegrated as well. The verbs \"shake\", \"take\" and \"forsake\" come closest to the original vowel sequence. The consonant anomaly in \"stand\" is still visible, and is extended to the participle.\nClass 6 verbs in modern English: \"draw, forsake, lade, shake, shape, shave, slay, stand, take\". The verb is in this class when used in a nautical context. Like most other classes in Modern English, this class has lost cohesion and now forms principal parts according to many different patterns. Two preterites (\"drew\" and \"slew\") are now spelled with \"ew\", which is similar in sound to the \"oo\" of the others that still use a strong form. \"Swear\" is now class 4. The adjective \"graven\" was originally a past participle of the now obsolete verb \"grave\". Note that \"lade, shape, shave, wax\" are now weak outside of their optionally strong past participle forms (\"laden, shapen\", \"shaven\", and \"waxen\" respectively). \"Fare\" has archaic past tense \"fore\" and rare past participle \"faren\", but is normally weak now.\n\nIn Modern English this class has lost its homogeneity:\nThe following modern English verbs descend from class 7 verbs, and still retain strong-verb endings: \"beat, blow, fall, hew, grow, hang, hold, know, throw\". (\"Hew\" can be a preterite or present, although the usual preterite is \"hewed\".) The verb \"let\" can be considered Class 7, though the past participle now lacks the ending \"-en\". The verbs \"mow\" and \"sow\" retain the strong-verb participles \"mown\" and \"sown\" but the preterites are now \"mowed\" and \"sowed\". (The verb \"sew\" was always weak, even though one can say \"sewn\" for the past participle.) Archaic English still retains the reduplicated form \"hight\" (\"called\", originally a past tense, usually with a passive meaning, but later also used as a passive participle). The verb \"crow\" was also in class 7, as in the King James Version \"while he yet spake, the cock crew\".\n\nA few English verbs have become \"strong\" but do not belong to any class:\n\nOld Dutch is attested only fragmentarily, so it is not easy to give forms for all classes. Hence, Middle Dutch is shown here in that role instead. The situation of Old Dutch generally resembled that of Old Saxon and Old High German in any case.\n\nChanges from West Germanic to Old Dutch:\n\nFrom Old Dutch to Middle Dutch:\n\nFrom Middle Dutch to Modern Dutch:\n\nThis class is well preserved and has the most strong verbs.\n\nClass 2b has grown by moving older class 2a verbs into it. In most dialects the historical \"eu\" merged with \"ū\", as both developed into \"ȳ\" and later into \"ui\". For those dialects class 2a essentially merged into the 2b class. In the southern dialects \"eu\" merged with \"io\" which became modern day \"ie\". The modern Dutch language has been influenced by both dialects and thus preserves both classes, although the 2a class has considerably shrunk in size. \n\nClass 3a and 3b have generalised part 3 to part 2, eliminating the \"-a-\" from this class. Some 3b verbs have a past in \"-ie-\" like class 7: \"helpen - hielp - geholpen\". This can be considered a new \"class 3 + 7\"\n\nClass 4 and 5 verbs still show the distinction in vowel between the past singular and plural, although this is not obvious due to the rules of Dutch orthography: \"ik nam\" (\"I took\") has the plural \"wij namen\" (not \"*nammen\"), that is, the 'short' vowel of the singular is replaced by the 'long' in the plural. (Note the relationship of consonant doubling to vowel length, which is explained at Dutch orthography). The pattern is therefore: \"breken brak (braken) gebroken\" (\"to break\")\n\nClass 6 has become very small, many of its verbs have gone weak or have become semi-strong. \n\nClass 7 has shrunk in the modern language, like class 6 many of its verbs have become semi-strong. (The verbs with * are nowadays mostly semi-strong)\n\nA special case is \"hoeven\", which is a weak verb that can decline a strong participle in some circumstances, even though the verb was never strong to begin with.\n\nThe distinction between strong and weak verbs has been lost in Afrikaans, as the original past tense has fallen out of use almost entirely, being replaced with the old perfect tense using the past participle. For example, the ancestral Dutch \"hij zong\" has become \"hy het gesing\" (\"he sang/has sung/had sung). One relic of a strong verbs remains, however: \"wees was gewees\" (\"to be\").\n\nFrom West Germanic to Old High German:\n\n\nChanges from Old High German to Modern German:\n\nThe classes are still well preserved in modern German.\n\nIn class 1, part 3 is generalised, eliminating the older \"-ei-\" or \"-e-\". However, a new subdivision arises because the \"i\" of the past tense forms is lengthened to \"ie\" before a single consonant. \"reiten ritt geritten\" (\"to ride\") versus \"leihen lieh geliehen\" (\"to loan\"). Class 1 verbs in modern German are:\nThe verbs \"leiden\"and \"schneiden\" preserved the verner alternation: \"leiden - litt - gelitten, schneiden - schnitt - geschnitten\".\n\nIn class 2, part 2 is generalised, eliminating older \"-u-\". Class 2b verbs are rare, as in Old High German. \nThe verb \"ziehen\" has preserved the verner alternation: \"ziehen - zog - gezogen\"\nThe verb \"sieden\" has preserved the verner alternation: \"sieden - sott - gesotten\".\n\nIn class 3, part 2 is generalised. The \"o\" of the 3b participle has been passed by analogy to some 3a verbs, and also to the past of some verbs of both groups: \"beginnen begann begonnen\", \"bergen barg geborgen\" (\"to rescue\"), \"quellen quoll gequollen\" (\"to well up\"). Thus, there are now 5 subgroups:\n\nIn class 4, part 2 is generalised, eliminating older \"-u-\" here also. Example: \"nehmen nahm genommen\" (\"to take\").\n\nClass 5 is little changed from Old High German. \n\nClass 6 is also preserved. In Modern German the \"uo\" is monophthongised to \"u\".\n\nIn class 7, the various past tense vowels have merged into a single uniform \"--\". Two verbs have back-formed new present stems from the past stem, and have eliminated \"grammatischer Wechsel\" and shortened the vowel in the past tense: \"fangen fing gefangen\" (\"to catch\"), \"hängen hing gehangen\" (\"to hang\")\n\nThe following changes occurred from West Germanic to Old Saxon:\n\nFrom Old Saxon to Middle Low German:\nAs in Middle Dutch Lengthening of vowels in open syllables: \"e\" > \"ē\", \"o\" > \"ō\", \"a\" > \"ā\", \"ö\" > \"ȫ\", ü > \"ǖ\". \"i\" Is often lengthened to \"ē\".\nFrom Middle Low German to Modern Low German:\n\nMost classes are quite well preserved, although the cohesion of some has been lost substantially or even entirely.\n\nChanges from Proto-Germanic to Old Norse:\n\n\ntærske \n\nChanges from Old Norse to modern Norwegian Nynorsk:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "178952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178952", "title": "Kimchi", "text": "Kimchi\n\nKimchi (; , ), a staple in Korean cuisine, is a traditional side dish made from salted and fermented vegetables, most commonly napa cabbage and Korean radishes, with a variety of seasonings, including \"gochugaru\" (chili powder), scallions, garlic, ginger, and \"jeotgal\" (salted seafood). There are hundreds of varieties of kimchi made with different vegetables as the main ingredients. In the past, kimchi was traditionally stored underground in jars to keep cool during warm months, and remain unfrozen throughout the winter months, during which time it was a vital source of vegetables. With the rise of technology, kimchi refrigerators are more commonly used to store kimchi.\n\nThe term \"ji\" (), which has its origins in archaic Korean \"dihi\" (), has been used to refer to kimchi since ancient times. The sound change can be roughly described as:\nThe Middle Korean form \"dihi\" is found in several books from \"Joseon\" (1392–1897). In Modern Korean, the word remains as the suffix \"-ji\" in the standard language (as in \"jjanji\", \"seokbak-ji\"), and as the suffix \"-ji\" as well as the noun \"ji\" in Gyeongsang and Jeolla dialects. The unpalatalized form \"di\" is preserved in P'yŏngan dialect.\n\n\"Gimchi\" () is the accepted word in both North and South Korean standard languages. Earlier forms of the word include \"timchɑi\" (), a Middle Korean transcription of the Sino-Korean word (literally \"submerged vegetable\"). \"Timchɑi\" appears in \"Sohak Eonhae\", the 16th century Korean rendition of the Chinese book, \"Xiaoxue\" (in Korean, \"Sohak\"). Sound changes from Middle Korean to Modern Korean regarding the word can be described as:\n\nThe aspirated first consonant of \"timchɑi\" became unaspirated in \"dimchɑi\", then underwent palatalization in \"jimchɑi\". The word then became \"jimchui\" with the loss of the vowel \"ɑ\" () in Korean language, then \"gimchi\", with the depalatalized word-initial consonant. In Modern Korean, the hanja characters are pronounced \"chimchae\" (), and are not used to refer to kimchi, or anything else. The word \"gimchi\" is not considered as a Sino-Korean word. Older forms of the word are retained in many regional dialects: \"jimchae\" (Jeolla, Hamgyŏng dialects), \"jimchi\" (Chungcheong, Gangwon, Gyeonggi, Gyeongsang, Hamgyŏng, Jeolla dialects), and \"dimchi\" (P'yŏngan dialect).\n\nThe English word \"kimchi\" perhaps originated from \"kimch'i\", the McCune–Reischauer transcription of the Korean word \"gimchi\" ().\n\nThe origin of kimchi dates back at least to the early period of the Three Kingdoms (37 BC‒7 AD). Fermented foods were widely available, as the \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\", a Chinese historical text published in 289 AD, mentions that \"The \"Goguryeo\" people [referring to the Korean people] are skilled in making fermented foods such as wine, soybean paste, and salted and fermented fish\" in the section named \"Dongyi\" in the \"Book of Wei\". \"Samguk Sagi\", a historical record of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, also mentions the pickle jar used to ferment vegetables, which indicates that fermented vegetables were commonly eaten during this time. During the Silla dynasty (57 BC – AD 935), kimchi became prevalent as Buddhism caught on throughout the nation and fostered a vegetarian lifestyle. \n\nThe pickling of vegetables was an ideal method, prior to refrigerators, that helped to preserve the lifespan of foods. In Korea, kimchi was made during the winter by fermenting vegetables, and burying it in the ground in traditional brown ceramic pots called \"onggi\". This labor further allowed a bonding among women within the family. A poem on Korean radish written by Yi Gyubo, a 13th century literatus, shows that radish kimchi was a commonplace in Goryeo (918–1392).\n\nKimchi has been a staple in Korean culture, but historical versions were not a spicy dish. Early records of kimchi do not mention garlic or chili pepper. Chili peppers, now a standard ingredient in kimchi, had been unknown in Korea until the early seventeenth century. Chili peppers, originated in the Americas, were introduced to East Asia by Portuguese traders. The first mention of chili pepper is found in \"Jibong yuseol\", an encyclopedia published in 1614. \"Sallim gyeongje\", a 17‒18th century book on farm management, wrote on kimchi with chili peppers. However, it was not until the 19th century that the use of chili peppers in kimchi was widespread. The recipes from early 19th century closely resemble today's kimchi.\n\nA 1766 book, \"Jeungbo sallim gyeongje\", reports kimchi varieties made with myriad of ingredients, including \"chonggak-kimchi\" (kimchi made with chonggak raddish), \"oi-sobagi\" (with cucumber), \"seokbak-ji\" (with \"jogi-jeot\"), and \"dongchimi\". However, napa cabbage was only introduced to Korea at the end of 19th century, and whole-cabbage kimchi similar to its current form is described in \"Siuijeonseo\", a cookbook published around that time.\n\nKimchi is a national dish of both North and South Korea. During South Korea's involvement in the Vietnam War its government requested American help to ensure that South Korean troops, reportedly \"desperate\" for the food, could obtain it in the field; South Korean president Park Chung-hee told U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson that kimchi was \"vitally important to the morale of Korean troops\". It was also sent to space on board Soyuz TMA-12 with South-Korean astronaut Yi So-yeon after a multimillion-dollar research effort to kill the bacteria and lessen the odor without affecting taste. On 22 November 2017 a Google Doodle was used to \"Celebrate Kimchi\".\n\nKimchi varieties are determined by the main vegetable ingredients and the mix of seasoning used to flavor the kimchi.\n\nCabbages (napa cabbages, bomdong, headed cabbages) and radishes (Korean radishes, ponytail radishes, gegeol radishes, yeolmu radishes) are the most commonly used kimchi vegetables. Other kimchi vegetables include: aster, balloon flower roots, burdock roots, celery, chamnamul, cilantro, cress, crown daisy greens, cucumber, eggplant, garlic chives, garlic scapes, ginger, Korean angelica-tree shoots, Korean parsley, Korean wild chive, lotus roots, mustard greens, onions, perilla leaves, potatoes, pumpkins, radish greens, rapeseed leaves, scallions, soybean sprouts, spinach, sugar beets, sweet potato vines, and tomatoes.\n\nBrining salt (with a larger grain size compared to kitchen salt) is used mainly for initial salting of kimchi vegetables. Being minimally processed, it serves to help develop flavours in fermented foods.\n\nCommonly used seasonings include \"gochugaru\" (chili powder), scallions, garlics, ginger, and \"jeotgal\" (salted seafood) \"Jeotgal\" can be replaced with raw seafood in colder Northern parts of the Korean peninsula. If used, milder \"saeu-jeot\" (salted shrimp) or \"jogi-jeot\" (salted croaker) is preferred and the amount of \"jeotgal\" is also reduced in Northern and Central regions. In Southern Korea, on the other hand, generous amount of stronger \"myeolchi-jeot\" (salted anchovies) and \"galchi-jeot\" (salted hairtail) is commonly used. Raw seafood or \"daegu-agami-jeot\" (salted cod gills) are used in the East coast areas.\n\nThe microorganisms present in kimchi are: \"Bacillus mycoides\", \"B. pseudomycoides\", \"B. subtilis\", \"Lactobacillus brevis\", \"Lb. curvatus\", \"Lb. kimchii\", \"Lb. parabrevis\", \"Lb. pentosus\", \"Lb. plantarum\", \"Lb. sakei\", \"Lb. spicheri\", \"Lactococcus carnosum\", \"Lc. gelidum\", \"Lc. lactis\", \"Leuconostoc carnosum\", \"Ln. citreum\", \"Ln. gasicomitatum\", \"Ln. gelidum\", \"Ln. holzapfelii\", \"Ln. inhae\", \"Ln. kimchii\", \"Ln. lactis\", \"Ln. mesenteroides\", \"Serratia marcescens\"., \"Weissella cibaria\", \"W. confusa\", \"W. kandleri\", \"W. koreensis\", and \"W. soli\".\n\nKimchi is a traditional Korean dish consisting of pickled vegetables, which is mainly served as a side dish with every meal, but also can be served as a main dish. Kimchi is mainly recognized as a spicy fermented cabbage dish globally. Variations are not limited, as Koreans \"can make kimchi out of anything edible; a concept which extends toward infinite possibilities...\" Variations of kimchi continue to grow, and the taste can vary depending on the region and season \n\nKimchi can be categorized by main ingredients, regions or seasons. Korea's northern and southern sections have a considerable temperature difference. There are over 180 recognized varieties of kimchi. The most common kimchi variations are\nKimchi from the northern parts of Korea tends to have less salt and red chili and usually does not include brined seafood for seasoning. Northern kimchi often has a watery consistency. Kimchi made in the southern parts of Korea, such as Jeolla-do and Gyeongsang-do, uses salt, chili peppers and \"myeolchijeot\" (, brined anchovy allowed to ferment) or \"saeujeot\" (, brined shrimp allowed to ferment), \"myeolchiaekjeot\" (), \"kkanariaekjeot\" (), liquid anchovy jeot, similar to fish sauce used in Southeast Asia, but thicker.\n\n\"Saeujeot\" () or \"myeolchijeot\" is not added to the kimchi spice-seasoning mixture, but is simmered first to reduce odors, eliminate tannic flavor and fats, and then is mixed with a thickener made of rice or wheat starch (). This technique has been falling into disuse in the past 40 years.\n\nWhite kimchi are neither red in color nor spicy. It includes white napa cabbage kimchi and other varieties such as white radish kimchi (\"dongchimi\"). Watery white kimchi varieties are sometimes used as an ingredient in a number of dishes such as cold noodles in \"dongchimi\" brine (\"dongchimi-guksu\").\n\n\nThis regional classification dates back to 1960s and contains plenty of historical facts, but the current kimchi-making trends in Korea are generally different from those mentioned below.\n\n\nDifferent types of kimchi were traditionally made at different times of the year, based on when various vegetables were in season and also to take advantage of hot and cold seasons before the era of refrigeration. Although the advent of modern refrigeration — including kimchi refrigerators specifically designed with precise controls to keep different varieties of kimchi at optimal temperatures at various stages of fermentation — has made this seasonality unnecessary, Koreans continue to consume kimchi according to traditional seasonal preferences.\n\nAfter a long period of consuming \"gimjang kimchi\" () during the winter, fresh potherbs and vegetables were used to make kimchi. These kinds of kimchi were not fermented or even stored for long periods of time but were consumed fresh.\n\n\nYeolmu radishes and cucumbers are summer vegetables made into kimchi, \"yeolmu-kimchi\" () which is eaten in several bites. Brined fish or shellfish can be added, and freshly ground dried chili peppers are often used.\n\n\"Baechu kimchi\" is prepared by inserting blended stuffing materials, called \"sok\" (literally \"inside\"), between layers of salted leaves of uncut, whole Napa cabbage. The ingredients of \"sok\" () can vary, depending on the different regions and weather conditions. Generally, \"baechu kimchi\" used to have a strong salty flavor until the late 1960s, before which a large amount of \"myeolchijeot\" or \"saeujeot\" had been used.\n\n\"Gogumasoon Kimchi\" is made from sweet potato stems.\n\nTraditionally, the greatest varieties of kimchi were available during the winter. In preparation for the long winter months, many types of kimjang kimchi () were prepared in early winter and stored in the ground in large kimchi pots. Today, many city residents use modern kimchi refrigerators offering precise temperature controls to store kimjang kimchi. November and December are traditionally when people begin to make kimchi; women often gather together in each other's homes to help with winter kimchi preparations. \"Baechu kimchi\" is made with salted baechu filled with thin strips of radish, parsley, pine nuts, pears, chestnuts, shredded red pepper, manna lichen (), garlic, and ginger.\n\nA 2004 book about vegetable preservation said that the preference of kimchi preparation in Korean households from the most prepared type of kimchi to less prepared types of kimchi was: baechu kimchi, being the most prepared type of kimchi, then kaktugi, then dongchimi and then chonggak kimchi. The book said that baechu kimchi comprises more than seventy percent of marketed kimchi and radish kimchi comprises about twenty percent of marketed kimchi.\n\nA 2003 article in the \"Los Angeles Times\" said that South Koreans consume 18kg (40lbs) of kimchi per person annually. A 2015 book cited a 2011 source that said that adult Koreans eat from to of kimchi a day.\n\nSome Koreans believe that kimchi helps them cope with their fast-paced lives. Kimchi is made of various vegetables and contains a high concentration of dietary fiber, while being low in calories. One serving also provides over 50% of the daily recommended amount of vitamin C and carotene. Most types of kimchi contain onions, garlic, ginger, and chili peppers, all of which are salutary. The vegetables used in kimchi also contribute to its overall nutritional value. Kimchi is rich in vitamin A, thiamine (B), riboflavin (B), calcium, and iron, and contains lactic acid bacteria, among those the typical species \"Lactobacillus kimchii\".\n\nDuring the 2003 SARS outbreak in Asia, many people believed that kimchi could protect against infection. While there was no scientific evidence to support this belief, kimchi sales rose by 40%.\n\nHowever, kimchi may also contribute to stomach cancer, which is the most common form of cancer in South Korea. In 2011, three Korean scientists reported that, \"Kimchi, which is allegedly believed to have anti-carcinogenic properties, accounts for approximately 20% of sodium intake [in South Korea]. Case-control studies on the intake level of kimchi and gastric cancer risk generally showed an increased risk among subjects with high or frequent intakes of kimchi.\"\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\nKimchi is known to be a traditional side dish as it is almost always served along with other side dishes in most Korean family households and restaurants. Kimchi can be eaten alone or with white rice, but it is also included in recipes of other traditional dishes, including porridges, soups, and rice cakes. Kimchi is also the basis for many derivative dishes such as kimchi stew (), kimchi pancake (), kimchi soup (), and kimchi fried rice (). \nArmy base stew () is a popular dish made with spam, sausage, and kimchi. It originated after the Korean war with ingredients that would be scrounged from the army.\n\nSouth Korea consumes 1.85 million metric tons of kimchi annually, or nearly 80 pounds a person. It imports a significant fraction of that, mostly from China, and runs a $47.3 million kimchi trade deficit.\n\nIn 1996, Korea protested against Japanese commercial production of kimchi arguing that the Japanese-produced product (\"kimuchi\") was different from kimchi (in particular, Japanese kimuchi was not fermented so it was salted but sweet cabbage). Korea lobbied for an international standard from the Codex Alimentarius, an organization associated with the World Health Organization that defines voluntary standards for food preparation for international trade purposes. In 2001, the Codex Alimentarius published a voluntary standard defining kimchi as \"a fermented food that uses salted napa cabbages as its main ingredient mixed with seasonings, and goes through a lactic acid production process at a low temperature\", but which neither specified a minimum amount of fermentation nor forbade the use of any additives.\n\nSouth Korea developed programs for adult Korean adoptees to return to South Korea and learn about what it means to be Korean. One of these programs was learning how to make kimchi.\n\nDue to heavy rainfall shortening the harvesting time for cabbage and other main ingredients for kimchi in 2010, the price of kimchi ingredients and kimchi itself rose greatly. Korean and international newspapers described the rise in prices as a national crisis. Some restaurants stopped offering kimchi as a free side dish, which \"The New York Times\" compared to an American hamburger restaurant no longer offering free ketchup. In response to the kimchi price crisis, the South Korean government announced the temporary reduction of tariffs on imported cabbage to coincide with the Kimjang season.\n\nSince 2012, the Chinese government has effectively banned Korean kimchi exports to China through government regulations. Ignoring the standards of Kimchi outlined by the Codex Alimentarius, China defined kimchi as a derivative of one of its own cuisines, called pao cai. However, due to significantly different preparation techniques from pao cai, kimchi has significantly more lactic acid bacteria through its fermentation process, which exceeds China's regulations. Since 2012, commercial exports of Korean kimchi to China has reached zero, the only minor amounts of exports accounting for Korean kimchi exhibition events held in China.\n\nKimchi-related items have been inscribed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by both South and North Korea. This makes kimchi the second intangible heritage that was submitted by two different countries, the other one being the folk song \"Arirang\" which was also submitted by both the Koreas.\n\nKimjang, the tradition of making and sharing of kimchi that usually takes place in late autumn, was added to the list as \"Kimjang, making and sharing kimchi in the Republic of Korea\". The practice of Kimjang reaffirms Korean identity and strengthens family cooperation. Kimjang is also an important reminder for many Koreans that human communities need to live in harmony with nature.\n\nNorth Korean kimchi-making was inscribed on the list in December 2015 as \"Tradition of kimchi-making in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\". North Korean kimchi tends to be less spicy and red than South Korean kimchi.\n\nA 2014 article in \"Tuổi Trẻ\" said that around 40 Vietnamese brides who had already married or who were going to marry Korean men spent two hours in a class in 2014 to make kimchi and kimbap at the Kim & Kim Company’s factory in the Tân Bình Industrial Zone of Ho Chi Minh City. The event was arranged by the Kim & Kim Company and the Korean Language Education Center in Ho Chi Minh City. The class is a free class that has been taught to 30 to 35 women once a month. Han Ji-sook, the director of the Korean Language Education Center in Ho Chi Minh City, said, \"Kimchi is important for Korean people, so anyone who visits the country will experience kimchi or kimchi-making. Especially for the wives of Korean men, it's important to know how to make kimchi.\" Kim Tae-kon, director of the Kim & Kim Company, said, \"All of these Vietnamese women who are going to live in Korea must eat kimchi every day, three meals a day. I'm pleased to give them the chance to learn how to make kimchi.\"\n\nA 2017 article in \"The New York Times\" said that anti-Korean sentiment in China has risen after South Korea's acceptance of the deployment of THAAD in South Korea, Government-run Chinese news media has encouraged the boycott of South Korean goods, and Chinese nationalists have vowed to not eat kimchi.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31998954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31998954", "title": "Mandatory tipping", "text": "Mandatory tipping\n\nMandatory tipping (also known as a mandatory gratuity or an autograt) is a tip which is added automatically to the customer's bill, without the customer determining the amount or being asked. It may be implemented in several ways, such as applying a fixed percentage to all customer's bills, or to large groups, or on a customer by customer basis. Some economists have argued that tipping is economically inefficient, and suggested that mandatory gratuity might solve some of this issue. \n\nSome bars in New York City's borough of Manhattan have instituted mandatory tipping. Mandatory tipping is considered an oxymoron, as tipping is by definition a voluntary act on the part of the customer. The BBC has reported that some find the practice bothersome; particularly those who are not aware that the tipping is used to subsidize the sub-standard pay at the workplace. One waiter in London, England has criticized the low wages to the popular press.\n\nMandatory tipping and voluntary tipping are illegal in some cases: Australian casino employees, and US government employees, for example. Tipping is not generally part of Japanese culture, and can be confusing or offensive. Tipping in China is frowned upon, except for those living in the semi-westernized regions of Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nSlightly less authoritative sources are appellate court decisions, with the U.S. Supreme Court at the top. Appellate courts regard mandatory gratuities as income for servers rather than a tip, thus affecting taxation. However, court cases have yet to set a precedent that failing to pay \"mandatory gratuity\" is illegal. \n\nRestaurant customers who pay the food portion of their bill but not the mandatory gratuity have at times been arrested, charges are generally dropped.\n\nSome cruise lines charge their patrons $10/day in mandatory tipping; this does not include extra gratuities for alcoholic beverages.\n\nJudith Martin in her 2005 manners book opines that fast food restaurants will never charge mandatory tipping for their customers, despite the presence of tip jars, and considers tipping for non-table services to be inappropriate.\n\nIan Ayres, Fredrick E. Vars & Nasser Zakariya published a paper suggesting that tipping contributed to racial prejudice, since ethnic minorities would often be less able to pay a large tip. Another paper by Yoram Margalioth of Tel Aviv University argued that there was a negative externality associated with tipping, and that the practice facilitated tax evasion. Two other American studies have contributed to the thesis that tipping is racially discriminatory, finding that ethnic minority servers and taxicab drivers received lower tips on average than their white counterparts. In the study of the servers, an attempt by the author to isolate other possible contributing factors, such as poor service, found that \"After controlling for these other variables … the server race effect is comparable across customer race.\"\n\nQuebec and Ontario allow employers to pay lower minimum wages to workers who would reasonably be expected to be receiving tips. In Ontario, the minimum wage is $14.00 per hour, with exceptions for students under 18 years old and employed for not more than 28 hours a week, who are paid $13.15 per hour; and both liquor and restaurant servers, who are paid $12.20 per hour. On April 13, 2010, the \"Toronto Star\" reported since 2009, it has become common for restaurant servers to give part of their tips to the business they work for.\n\nWorkers who receive tips are legally required to report the income to the Canada Revenue Agency and pay income tax on it. In Quebec, the provincial government automatically taxes servers 8% of their sales whether a gratuity was received or not. In other provinces, however, many workers have been known to report no income from tips at all or, perhaps more commonly, to \"lowball\" the figure. In response, the CRA has said that it will closely check the tax returns of individuals who would reasonably be expected to be receiving tips to ensure that the tips are reported realistically.\n\nAccording to guidelines established by the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association, autograts and any tip pool controlled and distributed by the restaurant is legally subject to income tax and other mandatory deductions before being paid to the servers. All other gratuities are deemed direct tips and it is the server's responsibility to declare them as taxable income when filing for income tax.\n\n"}
{"id": "2186735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186735", "title": "Medieval football", "text": "Medieval football\n\n\"Medieval football\" is a modern term used for a wide variety of localised football games which were invented and played in Europe during the Middle Ages. Alternative names include folk football, mob football and Shrovetide football. These games may be regarded as the ancestors of modern codes of football, and by comparison with later forms of football, the medieval matches were chaotic and had few rules.\n\nThe Middle Ages saw a rise in popularity of games played annually at Shrovetide throughout Europe, particularly in Great Britain. The games played in England at this time may have arrived with the Roman occupation but there is little evidence to indicate this. Certainly the Romans played ball games, in particular Harpastum. There is also one reference to ball games being played in southern Britain prior to the Norman Conquest. In the ninth century Nennius's \"Historia Britonum\" tells that a group of boys were playing at ball (\"pilae ludus\"). The origin of this account is either Southern England or Wales. References to a ball game played in northern France known as \"La Soule\" or \"Choule\", in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks, date from the 12th century.\n\nThese archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, would be played between neighbouring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a heaving mass of people struggling to drag an inflated pig's bladder by any means possible to markers at each end of a town. By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder. Sometimes instead of markers, the teams would attempt to kick the bladder into the balcony of the opponents' church. A legend that these games in England evolved from a more ancient and bloody ritual of kicking the \"Dane's head\" is unlikely to be true. These antiquated games went into sharp decline in the 19th century when the Highway Act 1835 was passed banning the playing of football on public highways. In spite of this, games continued to be played in some parts of the United Kingdom and still survive in a number of towns, notably the Ba game played at Christmas and New Year at Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands Scotland, Uppies and Downies over Easter at Workington in Cumbria, and the Royal Shrovetide Football Match on Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday at Ashbourne in Derbyshire, England.\n\nFew images of medieval football survive. One engraving from the early fourteenth century at Gloucester Cathedral, England, clearly shows two young men running vigorously towards each other with a ball in mid-air between them. There is a hint that the players may be using their hands to strike the ball. A second medieval image in the British Museum, London clearly shows a group of men with a large ball on the ground. The ball clearly has a seam where leather has been sewn together. It is unclear exactly what is happening in this set of three images, although the last image appears to show a man with a broken arm. It is likely that this image highlights the dangers of some medieval football games.\n\nMost of the very early references to the game speak simply of \"ball play\" or \"playing at ball\". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.\n\nThe earliest account of ball games being played in post-classical Europe comes from the 9th-century \"Historia Brittonum\", attributed to the monk Nennius. The text, written in Wales, mentions a group of boys \"playing at ball\" (pilae ludus).\n\nThe earliest reference from France which provides evidence of the playing of ball games (presumably La soule) comes in 1147. This refers to the handing over of \"seven balloons of greatest dimension\". An early description of ball games that are likely to be football in England was given by William FitzStephen (c. 1174 – 1183). He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday:\n\nThe earliest confirmation that such ball games in England involved kicking comes from a verse about Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln. This was probably written in the thirteenth century, being recorded by Matthew Paris, although the precise date is not known: \"Four and twenty bonny boys, were playing at the ball.. he kicked the ball with his right foot\".\n\nIn about 1200 \"ball\" is mentioned as one of the games played by King Arthur's knights in \"Brut\", written by Layamon, an English poet from Worcestershire. This is the earliest reference to the English language \"ball\". Layamon states: \"some drive balls (balles) far over the fields\". Records from 1280 report on a game at Ulgham, near Ashington in Northumberland, in which a player was killed as a result of running against an opposing player's dagger. This account is noteworthy because it is the earliest reference to an English ball game that definitely involved kicking; this suggests that kicking was involved in even earlier ball games in England. In Cornwall in 1283 plea rolls No. 111. mention a man named Roger who was accused of striking a fellow player in a game of \"soule\" with a stone, a blow which proved fatal.\n\nThe earliest reference to ball games being played by university students comes in 1303 when \"Thomas of Salisbury, a student of Oxford University, found his brother Adam dead, and it was alleged that he was killed by Irish students, whilst playing the ball in the High Street towards Eastgate\".\n\nIn 1314, comes the earliest reference to a game called football when Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree on behalf of King Edward II banning football. It was written in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: \"[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [\"rageries de grosses pelotes de pee\"] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future.\"\n\nAnother early account of kicking ball games from England comes in a 1321 dispensation, granted by Pope John XXII to William de Spalding of Shouldham:\n\"To William de Spalding, canon of Scoldham of the order of Sempringham. During the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his, also called William, ran against him and wounded himself on a sheathed knife carried by the canon, so severely that he died within six days. Dispensation is granted, as no blame is attached to William de Spalding, who, feeling deeply the death of his friend, and fearing what might be said by his enemies, has applied to the pope.\"\n\nBanning of ball games began in France in 1331 by Philip VI, presumably the ball game known as La soule.\nIn the mid-fourteenth century a misericord at Gloucester cathedral, England shows two young men playing a ball game. It looks as though they are using their hands for the game; however, kicking certainly cannot be excluded. It is notable for the fact that most other medieval images of ball games in England show large balls. This picture clearly shows that small balls were also used.\n\nKing Edward III of England also issued such a declaration, in 1363: \"[m]oreover we ordain that you prohibit under penalty of imprisonment all and sundry from such stone, wood and iron throwing; handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games\". It is noteworthy that at this time football was already being differentiated in England from handball, which suggests the evolution of basic rules. Between 1314 and 1667, football was officially banned in England alone by more than 30 royal and local laws. (See the article Attempts to ban football games for more details.)\n\nLikewise Geoffrey Chaucer offered an allusion to the manner in which contemporary ball games may have been played in fourteenth-century England. In the \"Canterbury Tales\" (written some time after 1380) he uses the following line: \"rolleth under foot as doth a ball\".\n\nEnglish Theologian John Wycliffe (1320–1384) referred to football in one of his sermons: \"and now þei clouten þer shone wiþ censuris, as who shulde chulle a foot-balle\" It may be the earliest use of the word \"football\" in English.\n\nThat football was known at the turn of the century in Western England comes from about 1400 when the West Midland Laud Troy War Book states in English: \"Hedes reled aboute overal As men playe at the fote-ball\"\n\nTwo references to football games come from Sussex in 1403 and 1404 at Selmeston and Chidham as part of baptisms. On each occasion one of the players broke his leg\n\nKing Henry IV of England provides the first documented use of the English word \"football\" when in 1409 he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for \"foteball\".\n\nIn 1409 on 4 March eight men were compelled to give a bond of £20 to the London city chamberlain for their good behaviour towards \"the kind and good men of the mystery of Cordwainers\" undertaking not to collect money for a football (pro pila pedali).\n\nIn 1410 King Henry IV of England found it necessary to impose a fine of 20S on mayors and bailiffs in towns where misdemeanours such as football occurred. This confirms that football was not confined to London.\n\nThe Accounts of the Worshipful Company of Brewers between 1421 and 1423 concerning the hiring out of their hall include reference to \"by the \"ffooteballepleyers\" twice... 20 pence\" listed in English under the title \"crafts and fraternities\". This reference suggests that bans against football were unsuccessful and the listing of football players as a \"fraternity\" is the earliest allusion to what might be considered a football club.\n\nThe earliest reference to football or kicking ball games in Scotland was in 1424 when King James I of Scotland also attempted to ban the playing of \"fute-ball\".\n\nIn 1425 the prior of Bicester, England, made a payment on St Katherine's day \"to sundry gifts to football players (ludentibus ad pilam pedalem)\" of 4 denarii. It is noteworthy that at this time the prior was willing to give his patronage to the game despite its being outlawed.\n\nIn about 1430 Thomas Lydgate refers to the form of football played in East Anglia known as Camp Ball: \"Bolseryd out of length and bread, lyck a large campynge balle\"\n\nIn 1440 the game of Camp Ball was confirmed to be a form of football when the first ever English-Latin dictionary, \"Promptorium parvulorum\" offers the following definition of camp ball: \"Campan, or playar at foott balle, pediluson; campyon, or champion\".\n\nIn 1472 the rector of Swaffham, Norfolk bequeathed a field adjoining the church yard for use as a \"camping-close\" or \"camping-pightel\" specifically for the playing of the East Anglian version of football known as Camp Ball.\n\nIn 1486 comes the earliest description of \"a football\", in the sense of a ball rather than a game. This reference is in Dame Juliana Berners' \"Book of St Albans\". It states: \"a certain rounde instrument to play with ...it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn 'pila pedalis', a fotebal.\" It is noteworthy that it was considered socially acceptable for a football to be included in medieval English Heraldry.\n\nThere is an account from 11 April 1497 of a sum of money \"giffen [given] to Jame Dog [James Doig] to b[u]y fut ballis to the King\".. It is not known if he himself played with them.\n\nThe earliest and perhaps most important description of a football game comes from the end of the 15th century in a Latin account of a football game with features of modern soccer. It was played at Cawston, Nottinghamshire, England. It is included in a manuscript collection of the miracles of King Henry VI of England. Although the precise date is uncertain it certainly comes from between 1481 and 1500. This is the first account of an exclusively \"kicking game\" and the first description of dribbling: \"[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions\" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football field, stating that: \"[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started. Nevertheless the game was still rough, as the account confirms: \"a game, I say, abominable enough . . . and rarely ending but with some loss, accident, or disadvantage of the players themselves.\"\n\nMedieval sport had no referee.\n\nIn 1510 comes the next description of early football by Alexander Barclay, a resident of the South East of England:\nThey get the bladder and blowe it great and thin, with many beanes and peason put within, It ratleth, shineth and soundeth clere and fayre, While it is throwen and caste up in the eyre, Eche one contendeth and hath a great delite, with foote and hande the bladder for to smite, if it fall to the ground they lifte it up again... Overcometh the winter with driving the foote-ball.\nThe first record of a pair of football boots occurs when Henry VIII of England ordered a pair from the Great Wardrobe in 1526. The royal shopping list for footwear states: \"45 velvet pairs and 1 leather pair for football\". Unfortunately these are no longer in existence. It is not known for certain whether the king himself played the game, but if so this is noteworthy as his son Edward VI later banned the game in 1548 it because it incited riots.\n\nThe reputation of football as a violent game persists throughout most accounts from 16th-century England. In 1531, Sir Thomas Elyot noted in his \"Boke named The Governour\" the dangers of football, as well as the benefits of archery (\"shooting\"):\n\nSome men wolde say, that in mediocritie, whiche I haue so moche praised in shootynge, why shulde nat boulynge, claisshe, pynnes, and koytyng be as moche commended? Verily as for two the laste, be to be utterly abiected of al noble men, in like wise foote balle, wherin is nothinge but beastly furie and extreme violence; wherof procedeth hurte, and consequently rancour and malice do remaine with them that be wounded; wherfore it is to be put in perpetuall silence. In class she is emploied to litle strength; in boulyng oftentimes to moche; wherby the sinewes be to moche strayned, and the vaines to moche chafed. Wherof often tymes is sene to ensue ache, or the decreas of strength or agilitie in the armes: where, in shotyng, if the shooter use the strength of his bowe within his owne tiller, he shal neuer be therwith grieued or made more feble.\nAlthough many sixteenth-century references to football are disapproving or dwell upon their dangers there are two notable departures from this view. First, Sir Thomas Elyot (although previously a critic of the game) advocates \"footeball\" as part of what he calls vehement exercise in his Castell of Helth published in 1534. Secondly English headmaster Richard Mulcaster provides in his 1581 publication the earliest evidence of organised, refereed football for small teams playing in formation.\n\nThe first reference to football in Ireland occurs in the \"Statute of Galway\" of 1527, which allowed the playing of football and archery but banned \" 'hokie' — the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves\" as well as other sports. (The earliest recorded football match in Ireland was one between Louth and Meath, at Slane, in 1712.)\n\nThe oldest surviving ball that might have been used for football games dates to about 1540 and comes from Scotland. It is made from leather and a pig's bladder. It was discovered in 1981 in the roof structure of the Queen's Chamber, Stirling Castle. Whilst other uses for the ball, such as pallone, have been suggested, most notably by the National Museum of Scotland, due to its size (diameter 14–16 cm), staff at the Stirling Smith Museum and researchers at the Scottish Football Museum have attributed its use to football, citing the description of the ball used in the Carlisle Castle game of 1568.\n\nThe violence of early football in Scotland is made clear in this sixteenth-century poem on the \"beauties of football\":\n\nThe earliest specific reference to football (pila pedalis) at a university comes in 1555 when it was outlawed at St John's College, Oxford. Similar decrees followed shortly after at other Oxford Colleges and at Cambridge University.\n\nAnother reference occurred in 1555, when Antonio Scaino published his treatise \"Del Giuoco della Palla\" (\"On the Game of the Ball\"). It was mostly concerned with a medieval predecessor of tennis, but near the end, Scaino included a chapter titled, \"Del Giuoco del Calcio\" (\"On the Game of Football\"), for comparison. According to Scaino, the game was popular with students. It could be played with any number of players. The only rules seem to be that weapons could not be brought onto the field, and the ball could not be thrown by hand. The goal was for each team to try to cross the ball across a marked space at the opposite end of the field. To start, the ball was placed in the middle of the field and kicked by a member of the team that was chosen by lots. Scaino remarks that its chief entertainment for the spectators was to see \"the players fall in great disarray & upside down.\"\n\nIn 1568 Sir Francis Knollys described a football game played at Carlisle Castle, Cumbria, England by the retinue of Mary Queen of Scots: `20 of her retinue played at football before her for two hours very strongly, nimbly, and skilfully\". According to contemporary sources and detailed publications Mary's retinue was predominantly Scottish, made up primarily by nobles who had followed her south in the aftermath of the Battle of Langside.\n\nThe first official rules of Calcio Fiorentino (Florentine kick) were recorded in 1580, although the game had been developing around Florence for some time before that date. The game involved teams of 27 kicking and carrying a ball in a giant sandpit set up in the Piazza Santa Croce in the centre of Florence, both teams aiming for their designated point on the perimeter of the sandpit.\n\nIn 1586, men from a ship commanded by English explorer John Davis, went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland.\n\nIn Wales, the game of \"cnapan\" was described at length by George Owen of Henllys, an eccentric historian of Pembrokeshire, in 1603:\"This game... is thought to be of great antiquity and is as followeth. The ancient Britons being naturally a warlike nation did no doubt for the exercise of their youth in time of peace and to avoid idleness devise games of activity where each man might show his natural prowess and agility... About one or two of the clock afternoon begins the play, in this sort, after a cry made both parties draw to into some plain, all first stripped bare saving a light pair of breeches, bare-headed, bare-bodied, bare legs and feet...The foot company thus meeting, there is a round ball prepared of a reasonable quantity so as a man may hold it in his hand and no more, this ball is of some massy wood as box, yew, crab or holly tree and should be boiled in tallow for m make it slippery and hard to hold. This ball is called cnapan and is by one of the company hurling bolt upright into the air, and at the fall he that catches it hurls it towards the country he plays for, for goal or appointed place there is none neither needs any, for the play is not given over until the cnapan be so far carried that there is no hope to return it back that night, for the carrying of it a mile or two miles from the first place is no losing of the honour so it be still followed by the company and the play still maintained, it is oftentimes seen the chase to follow two miles and more...\"\n\nThe earliest account of a ball game that involves passing of the ball comes from Richard Carew's 1602 account of Cornish Hurling which states \"Then must he cast the ball (named Dealing) to some one of his fellowes\". Carew also offers the earliest description of a goal (they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue score off,\nother twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales\") and of goal keepers (\"There is assigned for their gard, a couple of their best stopping Hurlers\").\n\nThe first direct reference to \"scoring a goal\" is in John Day's play \"The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green\" (performed circa 1600; published 1659): \"I'll play a gole at camp-ball\" (an extremely violent variety of football, which was popular in East Anglia). Similarly in a poem in 1613, Michael Drayton refers to \"when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe\".\nIn 1615 James I of England visited Wiltshire and the villagers \"entertained his Majesty with a foot-ball match\"\n\nOliver Cromwell who left Cambridge University in 1617 was described by James Heath as \"one of the chief matchmakers and players of football\" during his time at the university.\n\nIn 1623 Edmund Waller refers in one of his poems to \"football\" and alludes to teamwork and passing the ball: \"They ply their feet, and still the restless ball, Toss'd to and fro, is urged by them all\". In 1650 Richard Baxer gives an interesting description of football in his book Everlasting Rest: \"Alas, that I must stand by and see the Church, and Cause of Christ, like a Football in the midst of a crowd of Boys, tost about in contention from one to another... and may drive it before him. ... But to be spurned about in the dirt, till they have driven it on to the goal of their private interests\". This is noteworthy as it confirms that passing of the ball from one player to another was part of football games.\n\nThe first study of football as part of early sports is given in Francis Willughby's Book of Games,\n\nwritten in about 1660. This account is particularly noteworthy as he refers to football by its correct name in English and is the first to describe the following: modern goals and a pitch (\"a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals\"), tactics (\"leaving some of their best players to guard the goal\"), scoring (\"they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win\") and the way teams were selected (\"the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness\"). He is the first to describe a law of football: \"They often break one another's shins when two meet and strike both together against the ball, and therefore there is a law that they must not strike higher than the ball\". His account of the ball itself is also very informative: \"They blow a strong bladder and tie the neck of it as fast as they can, and then put it into the skin of a bull's cod and sew it fast in\". He adds: \"The harder the ball is blown, the better it flies. They used to put quicksilver into it sometimes to keep it from lying still\". His book includes the first (basic) diagram illustrating a football pitch.\n\n\nIn Scotland the Ba' game (\"Ball Game\") can be found at:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The organization has produced one Miss Universe (2010) – the second title for Mexico in that event, and two Miss International winners, 2007 and 2009.\n\nAspiring hopefuls, ranging from 18 to 23 years of age and a minimum height of , must fulfill the organization's additional requirements and \nconsequently vie in their respective state pageants for eligibility to participate in Nuestra Belleza México. Contestants are permitted to compete for their sub-national beauty titles more than once. However, this can no longer be done once they have taken part in the national event. They may also choose to represent a different state, as long as they provide proof of having resided in it for at least the last twelve months before registration.\n\nAs of the year 2000's edition of the pageant, it is not uncommon for some states to have more than one delegate competing simultaneously. This occurs when non-winning hopefuls from select subdivisions are invited (designated) by the organization to partake in the nationwide competition, taking into consideration their potential, and to possibly make up for other states which may lack representation. Usually three or four are designated annually.\n\nOnce in the national concentration, the participants engage in various events and appearances prior to the crucial preliminary competition from which a number of semi-finalists are chosen, only to be announced during the final competition. Additionally, five special awards given through sub-challenges enable the recipients an automatic pass to the semi-finals. During the crowning night, the semi-finalists are evaluated by a panel of judges while vying in swimsuit and evening gown, with eliminations taking place after each of these rounds. The remaining contestants are subsequently interviewed, and the runners-up and winners are respectively announced at the conclusion of the Nuestra Belleza México telecast.\n\nIf any of the titleholders is unable to fulfill her duties, the next in turn, known as the \"suplente\" (substitute), assumes the right to represent the country abroad. The pageant, which sees over thirty of the country's most beautiful young women going head to head each year, is held a year prior to when the winners compete internationally, giving them sufficient time to prepare for their corresponding beauty events.\n\nBelow are the names of the annual titleholders of Nuestra Belleza México, the states they represented and the venue which played host to their crowning, in ascending order.

{"id": "432001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=432001", "title": "Nose art", "text": "Nose art\n\nNose art is a decorative painting or design on the fuselage of an aircraft, usually on the front fuselage.\n\nWhile begun for practical reasons of identifying friendly units, the practice evolved to express the individuality often constrained by the uniformity of the military, to evoke memories of home and peacetime life, and as a kind of psychological protection against the stresses of war and the probability of death. The appeal, in part, came from nose art not being officially approved, even when the regulations against it were not enforced.\n\nBecause of its individual and unofficial nature, it is considered folk art, inseparable from work as well as representative of a group. It can also be compared to sophisticated graffiti. In both cases, the artist is often anonymous, and the art itself is ephemeral. In addition, it relies on materials immediately available.\n\nNose art is largely a military tradition, but civilian airliners operated by the Virgin Group feature \"Virgin Girls\" on the nose as part of their livery. In a broad sense, the tail art of several airlines such as the Eskimo of Alaska Airlines can be called \"nose art\", as are the tail markings of present-day U.S. Navy squadrons. There were exceptions, including the VIII Bomber Command, 301st Bomb Group B-17F \"Whizzer\", which had its girl-riding-a-bomb on the dorsal fin.\n\nPlacing personalized decorations on fighting aircraft began with Italian and German pilots. The first recorded piece of nose art was a sea monster painted on an Italian flying boat in 1913. This was followed by the popular practice of painting a mouth beneath the propeller's spinner, begun by German pilots in World War I. The \"cavallino rampante\" (prancing horse) of the Italian ace Francesco Baracca was another well-known image. Nose art of that era was often conceived and produced not by the pilots, but rather by the aircraft ground crews.\n\nOther World War I examples included the \"Hat in the Ring\" of the American 94th Aero Squadron (attributed to Lt. Johnny Wentworth) and the \"Kicking Mule\" of the 95th Aero Squadron. This followed the official policy, established by the American Expeditionary Forces' (AEF) Chief of the Air Service, Brigadier General Benjamin Foulois, on 6 May 1918, requiring the creation of distinct, readily identifiable squadron insignia. What is perhaps the most famous of all nose art, the shark-face insignia made famous by the First American Volunteer Group (AVG, the Flying Tigers), first appeared in World War I on a British Sopwith Dolphin and a German Roland C.II, though often with an effect more comical than menacing. Three decades later, the British pilots spotted it on German planes during World War II. The AVG in China decided to paint shark mouths on their P-40Bs after seeing a color photo in a newspaper of a shark mouth painted on a No. 112 Squadron RAF P-40 fighter in North Africa. The British version itself was inspired by \"sharkmouth\" nose art (without any eyes) on the Bf 110 heavy fighters of ZG 76.\n\nWhile World War I nose art was usually embellished or extravagant squadron insignia, true nose art appeared during World War II, which is considered by many observers to be the golden age of the genre, with both Axis and Allied pilots taking part. At the height of the war, nose-artists were in very high demand in the USAAF and were paid quite well for their services while AAF commanders tolerated nose art in an effort to boost aircrew morale. The U.S. Navy, by contrast, prohibited nose art, the most extravagant being limited to a few simply-lettered names, while nose art was uncommon in the RAF or RCAF.\n\nThe work was done by professional civilian artists as well as talented amateur servicemen. In 1941, for instance, the 39th Pursuit Squadron commissioned a Bell Aircraft artist to design and paint the \"Cobra in the Clouds\" logo on their aircraft. Perhaps the most enduring nose art of World War II was the shark-face motif, which first appeared on the Bf 110s of Luftwaffe 76th Destroyer Wing over Crete, where the twin-engined Messerschmitts outmatched the Gloster Gladiator biplanes of RAF 112 Squadron. The Commonwealth pilots were withdrawn to Egypt and refitted with Curtiss Tomahawks off the same assembly line building fighter aircraft for the AVG Flying Tigers being recruited for service in China. In November 1941, AVG pilots saw a 112 Squadron Tomahawk in an illustrated weekly and immediately adopted the shark-face motif for their own planes. This work was done by the pilots and ground crew in the field. However, the insignia for the \"Flying Tigers\" - a winged Bengal Tiger jumping through a stylized V for Victory symbol - was developed by graphic artists from the Walt Disney Company.\nSimilarly, when in 1943 the 39th Fighter Squadron became the first American squadron in their theatre with 100 kills, they adopted the shark-face for their P-38 Lightnings. The shark-face is still used to this day, most commonly seen on the A-10 Thunderbolt II (with its gaping maw leading up to the muzzle of the aircraft's GAU-8 Avenger 30mm cannon), especially those of the 23d Fighter Group, the AVG's descendent unit, and a testament to its popularity as a form of nose art.\nThe largest known work of nose art ever depicted on a WWII-era American combat aircraft was on a B-24J Liberator, tail number \"44-40973\", which had been named \"The Dragon and his Tail\" of the USAAF Fifth Air Force 64th Bomb Squadron, 43d Bomb Group, in the Southwest Pacific, flown by a crew led by Joseph Pagoni, with Staff Sergeant Sarkis Bartigan as the artist. The dragon artwork ran from the nose just forward of the cockpit, down the entire length of the fuselage's sides, with the dragon's body depicted directly below and just aft of the cockpit, with the dragon holding a nude woman in its forefeet.\nTony Starcer was the resident artist for the 91st Bomb Group (Heavy), one of the initial six groups fielded by the Eighth Air Force. Starcer painted over a hundred pieces of renowned B-17 nose art, including \"Memphis Belle\". A commercial artist named Brinkman, from Chicago was responsible for the zodiac-themed nose art of the B-24 Liberator-equipped 834th Bomb Squadron, based at RAF Sudbury, England.\n\nContemporary research demonstrates that bomber crews, which suffered high casualty rates during World War II, often developed strong bonds with the planes they were flying, and affectionately decorated them with nose art. It was also believed by the flight crews that the nose art was bringing luck to the planes.\n\nThe artistic work of Alberto Vargas's pin-up girls from \"Esquire\" Magazine was often duplicated, or adapted, by air force crews and painted on the nose of American and allied aircraft during World War II.\nSome World War II era nose art was commemorative or intended to honor certain people such as the B-29 Superfortress, \"The Ernie Pyle\".\n\nIn the Korean War, nose art was popular with units operating A-26 and B-29 bombers, C-119 Flying Boxcar transports, as well as USAF fighter-bombers. Due to changes in military policies and changing attitudes toward the representation of women, the amount of nose art declined after the Korean War.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, AC-130 gunships of the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Squadrons were often given names with accompanying nose art - for example, \"Thor\", \"Azrael - Angel of Death\", \"Ghost Rider\", \"War Lord\" and \"The Arbitrator.\" The unofficial gunship badge of a flying skeleton with a Minigun was also applied to many aircraft until the end of the war and was later adopted officially.\n\nNose art underwent a revival during the Gulf War and has become more common since Operation Enduring Freedom and the Iraq War began. Many crews are merging artwork as part of camouflage patterns. The United States Air Force had unofficially sanctioned the return of the pin-up (albeit fully clothed) with the Strategic Air Command permitting nose art on its bomber force in the Command's last years. The continuation of historic names such as \"Memphis Belle\" was encouraged.\n\nSource material for American nose art was varied, ranging from pinups such as Rita Hayworth and Betty Grable and cartoon characters such as Donald Duck, Bugs Bunny, and Popeye to patriotic characters (Yankee Doodle) and fictional heroes (Sam Spade). Lucky symbols such as dice and playing cards also inspired nose art, along with references to mortality such as the Grim Reaper. Cartoons and pinups were most popular among American artists, but other works included animals, nicknames, hometowns, and popular song and movie titles. Some nose art and slogans imposed contempt to the enemy, especially to enemy leaders.\n\nThe farther the planes and crew were from headquarters or from the public eye, the racier the art tended to be. For instance, nudity was more common in nose art on aircraft in the Pacific than on aircraft in Europe.\n\n\"Luftwaffe\" aircraft did not often display nose art, but there were exceptions. For example, Mickey Mouse adorned a Condor Legion Bf-109 during the Spanish Civil War and one Ju 87A was decorated with a large pig inside a white circle during the same period. Adolf Galland's Bf-109E-3 of JG 26 also had a depiction of Mickey Mouse, holding a contemporary telephone in his hands, in mid-1941. A Ju 87B-1 (\"Geschwaderkennung\" of S2+AC) of Stab II/St. G 77, piloted by Major Alfons Orthofer and based in Breslau-Schöngarten (today Copernicus Airport Wrocław) during the invasion of Poland, was painted with a shark's mouth, and some Bf 110s were decorated with furious wolf's heads, stylistic wasps (as with SKG 210 and ZG 1), or as in the case of ZG 76, the very shark mouths that inspired both the RAF's 112 Squadron and in turn the Flying Tigers in China, on their noses or engine covers. Another example was Erich Hartmann's Bf-109G-14, \"Lumpi\", with an eagle's head. The fighter wing Jagdgeschwader 54 was known as the \"Grünherz\" (Green Hearts) after their fuselage emblem, a large green heart. The Geschwader was originally formed in Thüringen, nicknamed \"the green heart of Germany\". Perhaps the flashiest Luftwaffe nose art was the red and white viper snake insignia running through the whole fuselage of certain Ju 87 Stukas that served with the II \"Gruppe\", and especially the 6. \"Staffel\" of StG 2 in North Africa, the only known artwork on an Axis-flown combat aircraft that could have rivaled the length of that on \"The Dragon and his Tail\" B-24. front portside view entire portside ground view.\n\nThe Soviet Air Force also decorated their planes with historical images, mythical beasts, and patriotic slogans.\n\nThe attitude of the Finnish Air Force to the nose art varied by unit. Some units disallowed nose art, while others tolerated it. Generally, the Finnish airforce nose art was humorous or satirical, such as the \"horned Stalin\" on Maj. Maunula's Curtiss P-36.\n\nThe Japan Air Self-Defense Force has decorated fighter aircraft with Valkyrie-themed characters under the names \"Mystic Eagle\" and \"Shooting Eagle\".\n\nBeginning in 2011, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force has AH-1S Cobra anti-tank helicopters and Kawasaki OH-1 observation helicopter named \"Ita-Cobra\" and \"Ita-Omega\" respectively, decorated in the theme of 4 Kisarazu (木更津) sisters (Akane (木更津茜), Aoi (木更津葵), Wakana (木更津若菜), Yuzu (木更津柚子)). The Aoi-chan first appeared in 2011, followed by the other three sisters in 2012.\n\nCanadian Forces were reported having nose art on CH-47D Chinook and CH-146 Griffon helicopters in Afghanistan.\n\nAdolf Galland was famous for painting Mickey Mouse on his aircraft, and the mascot was adopted by his \"Gruppe\" during the early airwar phase of World War II.\n\nWerner Mölders flew a yellow-nosed Bf 109F-2 while with JG 51 during June 1941.\n\nOther fighter aces and their nose art have become synonymous.\n\n\nThe markings of aces were often adopted by their squadrons, such as Galland's Mickey Mouse and Hartmann's black tulip (still in use until recently on the aircraft of JG 71 \"Richthofen\" - not known to be in use on the unit's new Eurofighter Typhoons).\n\nTed W. Lawson, who (along with journalist Bob Considine) famously wrote about the 1942 Doolittle Raid in \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\", piloted a B-25 Mitchell bomber nicknamed \"The Ruptured Duck\", after a minor training accident in which the aircraft tail scraped the ground during takeoff; this was decorated by a caricature of an angry Donald Duck figure with crutches and wearing a pilot's headphones.\n\nDesigns similar to aviation nose art could be found during World War II on some British torpedo boats, and German and US submarines.\n\nThe British MoD banned the use of pin-up women in nose art on Royal Air Force aircraft in 2007, as commanders decided the images (many containing naked women), were inappropriate and potentially offensive to female personnel, although there were no documented complaints.\n\nIn 1993 the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command ordered that all nose art should be gender-neutral.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3505907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3505907", "title": "Photovoice", "text": "Photovoice\n\nPhotovoice also known as picturevoice is a qualitative method used for community-based participatory research to document and reflect reality. It is an empowering and flexible process that combines photography with grassroots social action and is commonly used in the fields of community development, international development, public health, and education. Participants include community members of all ages and status including those who are discriminated against due to language, gender, race, class, disability, etc. Through their art, they bring new insights and perspectives which raise awareness of hidden or overlooked issues and aspects of the community.\n\nParticipants are asked to express their points of view or represent their communities by photographing scenes that highlight research themes. Common research themes include community concerns, community assets, social issues, and public health barriers. These photographs are collaboratively interpreted through discussions in both small and large groups, and narratives can be developed that explain how the photos highlight a particular research theme. These narratives are then used to promote dialogue to mobilize and help change-makers (i.e. policymakers) better understand and change the community. Thereby developing effective solutions and programs that address the issues and needs.\n\nPhotovoice was developed in 1992 by Caroline C. Wang of the University of Michigan, and Mary Ann Burris, Program Officer for Women's Health at the Ford Foundation headquartered in Beijing, China. The idea was built on the foundation that images and words together can effectively express communities and individual's needs, problems, and desires. In addition, the concept was strongly influenced by documentary photography, the concept empowerment, feminist theory, Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed to promote health education and his idea of critical consciousness.\n\nPhotovoice was first used to empower the silenced rural women in Yunnan Province, China to influence the policies and programs affecting them. Since then, the method has been used in different settings and populations, such as by refugees in San Diego seeking in–person medical interpretation options, by homeless adults in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by Dr. Claudia Mitchell to support community health workers and teachers in rural South Africa, and by Dr. Laura S. Lorenz of the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University in her work with brain injury survivors.\n\nIn the 21st century, some university professors have used the photovoice model to teach social work students. Photovoice has also been used in conjunction with collaging, drawing, and mapping in participatory studies which focus on the voice of participants and aim to make the familiar strange. In addition, it has been used as a tool to engage children and youth, giving them a safe environment and opportunity to communicate their concerns and coping strategies to policymakers and service providers. In other words, photovoice is used at all levels as a tool for self-development, sharing awareness, advocacy, research, needs assessment, monitoring, etc. So the use of photovoice allows one to capture and widen their perspective on all levels of various issues.\n\nAlso known as \"participatory photography\" or \"photo novella\", photovoice is considered a sub–type of \"participatory visual methods\" or picturevoice which includes techniques such as photo-elicitation and digital storytelling. These techniques allow research participants to create visuals that capture their individual perspectives as part of the research process. An example of this is found in Project Lives, a participatory photography project used to create a new image of project housing dwellers, published in April 2015. Two other forms of picturevoice include paintvoice, stemming from the work of Michael Yonas, and comicvoice, which has been pioneered by John Baird's \"Create a Comic Project\" since 2008, and to a lesser extent by Michael Bitz's \"Comic Book Project\".\n\nIn international research, photovoice has been seen to allow participants from the developing world to define how they want to be represented to the international community. The individuals are facilitated and given control to tell their stories and perspectives which empower them to be engaged and maintain a firm sense of authorship over their representations. This helps to convey a stereotype-free picture of what it means to live in a developing country to those supporting (i.e. funders and voters of the developed country) and doing international development (i.e. NGO and government agencies). In addition, photovoice allows the community to monitor the impact of the change created by development programs. This can help inform the outside agency about the process, true impacts (what is/isn't working and why), and complex reality, thus accompany wider and deeper research and analysis to improve the development progress.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "85584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85584", "title": "Pietas", "text": "Pietas\n\nPietas, translated variously as \"duty\", \"religiosity\" or \"religious behavior\", \"loyalty\", \"devotion\", or \"filial piety\" (English \"piety\" derives from the Latin), was one of the chief virtues among the ancient Romans. It was the distinguishing virtue of the founding hero Aeneas, who is often given the adjectival epithet \"pius\" (\"religious\") throughout Virgil's epic \"Aeneid\". The sacred nature of \"pietas\" was embodied by the divine personification Pietas, a goddess often pictured on Roman coins. The Greek equivalent is \"eusebeia\" (εὐσέβεια).\n\nCicero defined \"pietas\" as the virtue \"which admonishes us to do our duty to our country or our parents or other blood relations.\" The man who possessed \"pietas\" \"performed all his duties towards the deity and his fellow human beings fully and in every respect,\" as the 19th-century classical scholar Georg Wissowa described it.\n\n\"Pietas erga parentes\" (\"\"pietas\" toward one's parents\") was one of the most important aspects of demonstrating virtue. \"Pius\" as a \"cognomen\" originated as way to mark a person as especially \"pious\" in this sense: announcing one's personal \"pietas\" through official nomenclature seems to have been an innovation of the late Republic, when Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius claimed it for his efforts to have his father, Numidicus, recalled from exile. \"Pietas\" extended also toward \"parents\" in the sense of \"ancestors,\" and was one of the basic principles of Roman tradition, as expressed by the care of the dead.\n\n\"Pietas\" as a virtue resided within a person, in contrast to a virtue or gift such as \"Victoria,\" which was given by the gods. \"Pietas,\" however, allowed a person to recognize the divine source of benefits conferred.\n\nThe first recorded use of \"pietas\" in English occurs in Anselm Bayly’s \"The Alliance of Music, Poetry, and Oratory\", published in 1789.\n\nPietas was represented on coin by cult objects, but also as a woman conducting a sacrifice by means of fire at an altar. In the imagery of sacrifice, libation was the fundamental act that came to symbolize \"pietas\".\n\n\"Pietas\" is first represented on Roman coins on \"denarii\" issued by Marcus Herennius in 108 or 107 BC. Pietas appears on the obverse as a divine personification, in bust form; the quality of \"pietas\" is represented by a son carrying his father on his back; the symbolism of which would be echoed in Virgil's Aeneid, with Aeneas carrying his father Anchises out of the burning Troy. Pietas is among the virtues that appear frequently on Imperial coins, including those issued under Hadrian.\n\nOne of the symbols of \"pietas\" was the stork, described by Petronius as \"pietaticultrix\", \"cultivator of \"pietas\".\" The stork represented filial piety in particular, as the Romans believed that it demonstrated family loyalty by returning to the same nest every year, and that it took care of its parents in old age. As such, a stork appears next to Pietas on (on whose \"cognomen\" see above).\n\nPietas was the divine presence in everyday life that cautioned humans not to intrude on the realm of the gods. Violations of \"pietas\" required a \"piaculum\", expiatory rites.\n\nA temple to Pietas was vowed \"(votum)\" by Manius Acilius Glabrio at the Battle of Thermopylae in 191 BC.\n\nAccording to a miraculous legend \"(miraculum),\" a poor woman who was starving in prison was saved when her daughter gave her breast milk (compare Roman Charity). Caught in the act, the daughter was not punished, but recognized for her \"pietas\". Mother and daughter were set free, and given public support for the rest of their lives. The site was regarded as sacred to the goddess Pietas \"(consecratus deae)\" because she had chosen to manifest her presence there. The story exemplified \"pietas erga parentes\", the proper devotion one ought to show to one's parents.\n\nPietas was often depicted as goddess on the reverse of Roman Imperial coins, with women of the imperial family on the obverse, as an appropriate virtue to be attributed to them. Women of the Imperial family might be portrayed in art in the goddess's guise.\n\n"}
{"id": "1116657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1116657", "title": "Pixiu", "text": "Pixiu\n\nPixiu (), is a Chinese mythical hybrid creature, commonly, but incorrectly referred to in the West by the Greek word \"chimera\", and considered a powerful protector of practitioners of Feng Shui. It resembles a strong, winged lion. Pixiu is an earth and sea variation, particularly an influential and auspicious creature for wealth. It is said to have a voracious appetite towards only gold, silver and jewels. Therefore, traditionally to the Chinese, Pixiu has always been regarded as an auspicious creature that possessed mystical powers capable of drawing \"Cai Qi\" (財氣 wealth) from all directions. Because of this, according to Chinese zodiac, it is especially helpful for those who are going through a bad year.\n\nThere are two different types of Pixiu, a male and a female. The physical difference is seen by their antlers. The one with two antlers is the female of the species and is called a \"Bìxié\" and the one with one antler is the male of the species and is called a \"Tiān lù\".\n\n\nPixiu craves the smell of gold and silver and it likes to bring his master money in his mouth. Statues of this creature are often used to attract wealth in feng shui.\n\nToday, Pixiu are also a popular design on jade pendants. It was also featured as a design on the sword of Fa Mulan's character in the 1998 Disney animated feature \"Mulan\".\n\nFierce looking and covered with whitish-grey fur, \"Pixiu\", are a type of auspicious, winged animal, written about in ancient Chinese history and heralded through the millennia by fantastic stories of powerful and grandiose feats of victory in battle. Their fantastic legend has been passed down through two-thousand years of Chinese lore. They have the powerful head of a Chinese dragon, the bold body of a lion and, historically, depending on whether it is a male or female, sports on its head either one antler (male) or two antlers (female). In modern times, the historical physical appearance of this legendary creature has been somewhat lost and, as time has passed, it is now more commonly depicted with only one antler, which would be a male according to the ancient descriptions.\n\nAncient Chinese descriptions, depictions and stone carvings of Pixiu from the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD) show the male with a single antler and the female with two. As with the Chinese Phoenix, the common image today is a representation of a single sex with one antler (male). Pixiu have protruding eyes and sharp teeth. Its strong body resembles a Chinese lion and its feet have paws and claws. There is one ancient, stone sculpture variation found with hooves, but all Pixiu always have wings. Many have a bifurcated (split) tail that hangs low and downward, covering their buttocks and rectums, a representative metaphor that they hold gold inside their stomachs but will not let it out.\n\nLooking at the posture of Pixiu, the creature seems to project a sense of strength, elegance and mobility. Likewise it has a big, opened mouth ready to gobble up gold and fortunes for its master. Because of this, a Pixiu statue is often employed in the home as a way of receiving and keeping fortunes and wealth.\n\nImperial Pixiu used during the Qing dynasty developed the physical characteristic of a fatter, more rotund body, indicating a stomach that could be loaded with unlimited amounts of gold and all forms of wealth and good fortune.\n\nDue to their similar appearances, the Pixiu is often confused with fu dogs or \"Qilin\", but Pixiu can easily be distinguished apart from those two animals by its pair of feathered wings with which it can fly between Heaven and Earth.\n\nOne story of the Pixiu tells that it violated a law of Heaven by defecating on the floor of Heaven. When it was found out, it was punished by a spanking executed by the Jade Emperor. The spanking was hard enough to cause its rectum to be permanently sealed. The Jade Emperor further declared that the diet of the Pixiu would be restricted to gold, silver and jewels. This is why Pixiu can eat gold, silver and jewels but cannot expel it. This is one of the origins of the status of Pixiu statues as a symbol of the acquisition and preservation of wealth.\n\nAnother story says that Pixiu, was the well-behaved, youngest son of the Dragon King and was spoiled by its parents. One day Pixiu was playing on the Dragon King's desk and accidentally broke a very important seal that represented the power of the Dragon King. The Dragon King became very angry and used magic to turn Pixiu into an animal. He then sealed his rectum and declared that from then on, Pixiu could only eat things that represented wealth, such as gold, silver and jewels.\n\n<nowiki>\"</nowiki>Pixiu\" was reputed as a very fierce creature. The large fangs, visible in the creatures' snarling mouths, are used to attack demons and evil spirits, draining their essence and converting it to wealth. Pixiu also guard against disease caused by these same evil spirits. It is written that Pixiu patrols the Heavens to keep demons at bay and to protect their owners from all harm.\n\nIt was believed that the ferociously devoted Pixiu would always and constantly guard its Master, even after he passed from this life into the next world. It was also believed that Pixiu would help their Masters ascend to heaven by flying them up to Heaven while they rode on their strong backs.\n\n\"Pixiu\" appear to have their origin in the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD) where they are found mentioned and were originally called \"táo bá\" in the Book of Han, an ancient written account of the history of China. \n\nThe Book of Han was completed in the year 111 A.D. In Chapter 96, it is written, \"\"In the country of Wū Gē Shān Lí there exist creatures called \"táo bá\" (meaning \"selected peach\"), lions and rhinoceros.\" -from the section entitled Accounts of the Western Regions.\" An annotation is also found therein where the female and male \"táo bá\" are further described as having antlers like a deer, but the male, which was referred to as “Tiān lù\", has only one antler and the female, referred to as \"“Bìxié\"\", has two antlers.\n\nIn tribute to the legend of the ferocity and prowess of the Pixiu in battle, the Pixiu became synonymous with the army in ancient China. In fact, the word \"pixiu\", interpreted as meaning \"fierce beast\" and also \"brave warrior\", was used as a symbol on battle flags and banners.\n\nThe Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty, in ancient China, declared that the wonderful, magnificent and devoted Pixiu, who obtained and guarded the Master's gold, would be forever known as the \"Treasure of the Emperor\". It is said that the Emperor declared that only Royal persons could possess a Pixiu and it was strictly forbidden for all others to own one, including officials. This law was kept through to the end of the Qing dynasty.\n\nDuring China's history, Pixiu were commonly displayed in ancient architecture to ward off \"Yin Qi\" (陰氣) and to harness auspicious \"Qi\".\nThe statues of a Pixiu are commonly found on the four corners of the roofs of houses, palaces and halls of the most important people such as the Chinese Emperor. The Pixiu sits behind the dragon, the phoenix, the winged horse, the sea horse, etc., in a guarding manner. \nIn ancient China, stone statues of Pixiu (Bixie) were also used as tomb guardians of Han dynasty emperors and other royal persons.\n\nPixiu (aka \"Pi Yao\" in some modern cultural translations) is the heavenly variation of a particularly powerful and auspicious creature of good fortune. They are said to have the power to assist anyone suffering from bad \"Feng Shui\" due to having offended the Grand Duke Jupiter (Tai Sui). In 2005, the Grand Duke resided in the West, so those born in the year of the Rabbit will have been in conflict with him. Practitioners of Feng Shui should ensure that they display the Pixiu (Pi Yao) in the West to appease Tai Sui. The Pixiu (Pi Yao) should also be displayed in homes for those enduring a period of bad luck soon after moving into a new home or soon after undertaking renovations. In 2006, \"Tai Sui\" moved to the Northwest. His exact position in 2006 is West-Northwest.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44450846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44450846", "title": "Prison violence", "text": "Prison violence\n\nPrison violence is a daily occurrence due to the diverse inmates with varied criminal backgrounds in penitentiaries. The three different types of attacks are inmate on inmate, inmate on guard, and self-inflicted. These attacks can either be impulsive and spontaneous or well-planned out and premeditated. Factors such as gang rivalries, overcrowding, minor disputes, and prison design contribute to the violent attacks that transpire. Prisons are trying to avoid, or at least better deal with these situations by being proactive. They are taking steps like placing violent convicts and gang leaders into solitary confinement, balancing the cells by critically examining each inmate to see where they are likely to reside peacefully, reducing blind spots, and training as well as educating the officers.\n\nPrison violence is inflicted onto either another inmate, a prison guard, or themselves. In 1999, it was reported that one in five inmates, or twenty percent of inmates, at fourteen state prisons had been physically assaulted by another inmate. Prison violence can consist of inmates fighting with their fists, homemade weapons, or being raped. The attacks that are implemented onto anyone but the self are either instrumental or expressive.\n\n\n\n\nPrison violence is capable of occurring anywhere throughout a prison. Any inmate is capable of acting rash and snapping at any given moment, that an outbreak can occur anywhere and at any time. Oftentimes, an inmate will look for a place that offers a sufficient amount of time to commit their act proficiently. If they are outside of their cell, they have the chance to smuggle out a homemade weapon by placing it up their rectum. Although these acts can occur anywhere, a very common place inmates search for is a blind spot.\n\nPrisons are covered with guards standing watch, CCTV, or a combination of the two. Neither of these can possibly cover every inch of a prison’s ground, which is why “…blind spots…allow inmates to conceal illicit activity from security staff”. Therefore, inmates purposefully look for these blind spots to commit violent acts undetected by prison guards. The inmate’s goal is to know that they are going to be able to complete the act of violence to the degree that they desire without guards noticing and intervening. Inmates look for places that give them more time to complete their attacks.\n\nThe perpetrators of violent attacks are convicted criminals, some of whom in prison for committing crimes that left multiple people brutally beaten and left for dead, so violence is in many of these individual’s nature. These people, “…settle disputes and seek power in the way they are accustomed- through violence”. This natural fire in their bellies is undoubtedly a huge factor that goes into why prison violence occurs, but the physical design of the prison can serve as another factor. A prison can either have indirect or direct supervision. Both types of supervision have their strengths, but also detrimental weaknesses.\n\nIndirect supervision is when a correctional officer is placed in an enclosed booth and must constantly watch over the inmates through a bird’s eye view. The physical interactions that officers have with the inmates is minimal, for most of the communication comes through an intercom system. Inmates are placed in their own cells and officers have physical barriers to ensure their own safety. When havoc is wreaked, a call for a response team is placed over the intercom. This type of supervision is strong, but has some drawbacks, such as the creation of blind spots. These are created through indirect supervision because the guards standing watch can have objects blocking tiny spots or they may just not be looking in the right direction at the right time. Indirect supervision is an impersonal and more distant form of supervision that helps with officer safety, but leaves blind spots for “…inmates to conceal illicit activity from security staff”.\n\nDirect supervision is a more personal type of design because officers are assigned a cell block to patrol. Through this layout, the guards actually speak to cellmates one-on-one. The minor altercations that take place throughout the day is directly handled by the patrol officer, but this single officer cannot prevent a violent attack from happening. As soon as their back is turned or their attention is focused on someone else, the perpetrator can still commit their violence. In this form of supervision officers are left more vulnerable, but it also leads to, “…decreased tension and stress of staff and inmates…”. Direct supervision is more of a hands-on form of management, where “…major incidents are not as numerous and minor incidents result in higher numbers…”.\n\nOvercrowding is a huge problem many prisons face because handling so many short-fused inmates at once can lead to many altercations. The combination of “…overcrowding, inadequate supervision, and inmate access to weapons- can create opportunities for…offenses”. Trying to assert authority and strict rules on these violent offenders is extremely difficult due to the fact that these people do not respond well to restrictions and being told what to do. Having to focus on so many dangerous people at once is just not possible because there will always be someone not being watched over at any given moment; this is most likely when inmates choose to strike. Overcrowding is a very common issue in American prisons that leads to prison violence because the prisons will be understaffed.\n\nPrison violence and prison suicide in England and Wales have been increasing year on year while staffing levels have been falling. Reduction in the number of staff is blamed for this and the Ministry of Justice has admitted that staff cuts are a factor.<ref name=\"Guardian27/10/2016\">Prison violence epidemic partly due to staff cuts, MoJ admits \"The Guardian\"</ref> It was felt urgent action was needed. The government has provided money for increased staff but staffing levels are set to remain below 2010 levels.\n\nMark Day, of the Prison Reform Trust spoke of a “hidden emergency unfolding in our prison system” and said increasing prison violence should not become the new normal the lives of people living and working in prisons depended on that. Frances Crook, of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \nMost inmates look to get into an altercation armed with some sort of homemade weapon. The weapons they use to attack their victims are made to be very destructive and can easily be both hidden and accessed. They use objects such as shanks, clubs, daggers, razors, and saps to serve as weapons. A shank is a homemade knife, and is used to stab the person they are planning on fighting with, typically created by sharpening a common object. Clubs are considered “…objects such as pitchers, hot pots, and broom handles…”. They are put into use by throwing or hitting their target with these objects. A sap is typically a padlock enclosed in a sock, but really any hard object can be placed inside. Their prey is hit, typically over the head, with this weapon. Razor blades are very commonly used to commit prison violence. When an inmate knows there is a possibly of facing an attack, they will often place razors inside their mouths (in their cheeks) so that they can spit the razor out of their mouth and slash up the other person’s face. Since this tactic has been caught onto, many times a person will first punch whomever they are fighting in the face so that if a razor is in there, their whole mouth will get cut up. An inmate can choose the shank, club, dagger, razor, or sap as their weapon of choice to either do harm or protect themselves. When it comes to creating these weapons, prisoners really do serve as craftsmen and make weapon-making into an art of the sort.\n\nThe prison store, supplies provided by prisons, and objects visitors bring are typically where the weapon creation process begins. They get a hold of items, “…such as disposable razors and toothbrushes”. Then, these materials get manipulated and transformed into a weapon of destruction. They may sharpen it or harden it using other items. In other instances, “Items that appear innocuous have been converted into weapons”. Inmates also use everyday items in their natural form in dangerous ways that is clearly not used as they were originally intended. Often, when an inmate uses this form to create their weapons, it is used on officers because the items do not look questionable so it is easy to catch the corrections officer off guard. Some will, “…fashion the metal post of a bunk bed or the edge of a cell door into a spear…that could be flung from inside a cell and penetrate a man’s neck or liver”, which is called the bone crusher. Some inmates will go to great lengths to create weapons and many different ways to create these weapons has been discovered.\n\nOfficers call prison gangs STGs, or security threat groups. These groups are highly dangerous and take part in a huge majority of attacks that occur in prisons. Originally, “The early formation of STGs was based on racial/ethnic ideologies and protection from other groups. Later they developed the intent to commit acts of violence and form crime syndicates”. These gangs’ sole purpose is to have control and dominance, which is gained through violent attacks. Often, these attacks are committed onto rivals and people issued in the Bad News List. The Bad News List can be presumed as a factor for prison violence. This list is circulated among a gang and once a name is found on this list, it is inevitable that they will be attacked. A person is typically place on the Bad News List if they, “…stole from an affiliate on the outside, or because you failed to repay a drug debt, or because you’re suspected of ratting someone out”. The people on the list will be attacked on sight, but once their debts are paid, they are immediately removed from the Bad News List. Most, if not all, gang prison violence is instrumental and is very intricately planned out. Gang members will often send out or receive encoded, in depth letters on violent attacks that are ordered to take place, other times, “…gang members used the drainage pipes of their in-cell toilets to communicate clandestinely across cellblocks…”. It has become clear that, “Extensive communication systems coordinated between inmates, criminal activity, and street gangs are common”, and a vast majority of the prison violence that occurs begins with these communication systems. Security threat groups are at the heart of many of the altercations that take place within prison walls and they remorselessly commit these vicious acts simply because they are ordered to do so.\n\nInmates often feel animosity and a sense of hatred towards prison guards due to the treatment they receive and the power the guards have over them. In 1999, more than 2,400 correctional officers required medical attention after being assaulted by an inmate, and according to a 2002-2003 study, most guards were assaulted through the use of clubs. Along with these clubs, inmates tend to use weapons of opportunity when attacking an officer. A weapon of opportunity is any typical, everyday object that is not considered a weapon until used in a destructive way. The reason for this hostility, and ultimately inmate attacks on guards can be placed onto the way the incarcerated are treated.\n\nInmates are often humiliated and have extreme force placed upon them. There are no excuses that can be made in an officer’s offense to defend these actions, unless their life was put into jeopardy. Implementing these uncalled for actions reasonably cause animosity between the inmates and guards. There are cases where if an inmate disobeys an order, “…groups of officers…approach his cell, dressed in protective gear and armed with shield, Tasers, and other weapons. If the inmate refuses to comply, the officers will flood his cell with chemical agents…they have reportedly thrown stinger grenades, which spray rubber pellets into a concentrated area…and violently subdue him”. Correctional and Detention personnel use force as a last resort, in the above scenario; entry into an inmate's cell would need to be necessary before force could be justified. For example, if an inmate has a court hearing and has barricaded himself in his cell, refusing to come out or comply with the officials orders force might be used. Another instance would be if the inmate needed to be transferred to another facility and refuses to comply with the directives to move.\n\nPreventing all prison violence is an impossible task because it is impossible to be prepared for any and every situation. Nevertheless, prisons are taking measures to avoid, or at least limit, this violence. They are doing things such as balancing the cells, reducing blind spots, and training officers. When prisons receive new inmates, they search the background of the individual; they look into things like any possible gang affiliation and any history of racism or anger issues. After piecing this information together, the officers will place them in a cell block that they feel is most appropriate and that will cause the least arousal between the new inmate and the ones already housed there. Reducing the blind spots is a difficult task to complete because it is impossible to watch every inch of the prison at once, but by watching over as much as possible at a time does reduce the chances of violence occurring. Training officers is the third measure being taken. If officers treat the inmates properly and not be rash and assert violence on them so quickly, the inmates may feel more respected and not look to retaliate. Also with the training, officers are learning how to deal with minor altercations more effectively, as in without force and violence unless necessary. Also, the correction officers are learning about the psychology of the inmates. These officers are becoming aware of the psychological differences and hardships the incarcerated tend to face and how to properly deal with them. If all of these precautionary measures are taken, then prison violence rates can definitely lower, although completely vanishing is something not likely.\n\nA supermax is a separate facility within a prison where inmates are placed, “…for violent/predatory behavior within other institutions. They may be identified as gang leaders, or considered high risk for escape. Inmates incarcerated in the supermax facility do not have the freedoms allowed inmates in general population because of their security status/institutional disciplinary record”. These inmates are placed in a cell for twenty three hours a day and have limitation than the typical convict possess. This prevention measure works because it takes the biggest threats and influences, such as gang members, out of the picture. An issue that arises with this is that, “…some prisoners subjected to isolation become so damaged that they pose a renewed threat to staff and inmates when they return to the general prison population”. This means that the already dangerous and threatening inmates can return to the regular prison population with a new, stronger desire to retaliate and cause prison violence. The supermax facility serves as a good method to eradicate the influence of the most dangerous of inmates, but risks the return of a vengeful inmate.\n"}

They include the vara, the cordel, the league and the labor. The units of area used to express the area of land are still encountered in some transactions in land today. For example, the 'vara' is still used in Costa Rica when ordering lumber.\n\nA vara (meaning \"rod\" or \"pole\", abbreviation: var) is an old Spanish unit of length. Varas are a surveying unit that appear in many deeds in the southern United States, and varas were also used in many parts of Latin America. It varied in size at various times and places; the Spanish unit was set at about in 1801. In Argentina, the vara measured about , and typical urban lots are wide (10 Argentine varas). At some time a value of was adopted in California.\n\nIn Texas, a vara was defined as , or 1 yard = 1.08 vara. The vara and the corresponding unit of area, the square vara, were introduced in the 19th century to measure Spanish land grants. In Texas, Stephen F. Austin's early surveying contracts required that he use the vara as a standard unit. The vara can be seen in many deeds as late as the mid to late 1900s. is equivalent to 5,645.376 Texan square varas. A league is equivalent to 5,000 varas squared or .\n\nTo convert varas to feet, take the varas and divide by 0.36.\n\nStandardization of measurement in Texas came with the introduction of varas, cordels, and leagues.\n\nA measure of 100 varas by 100 varas (Spanish) is almost 7000 square meters, and is known traditionally throughout Latin America as a \"manzana\" (\"i.e.\", a \"city block\"). As well, lumber is still measured in Costa Rica using a system based on 4 vara, or 11 feet, for both round and square wood. With square wood, using inches, the width is multiplied by the depth to get a measurement which they call \"pulgadas\", or inches. The lumber is charged 'per inch', which is a measurement 11/12 of a board foot.\n\nA labor ( in West Texas) is a unit of area, used to express the area of land, that is equal to 1 million square varas. A labor is equivalent to about . It was used in the archaic system of old Spanish land grants affecting Texas and parts of adjoining states. The labor is often used as an approximate equivalent to a \"quarter-section\" (that is, one quarter of a square mile of land). It is still encountered in modern real estate transactions.\n\nA league can also be a unit of area, used to express the area of land, that is equal to 25 million square varas. A (square) league is equivalent to about . It was used in the archaic system of old Spanish land grants affecting Texas and parts of adjoining states and this use of league is used throughout the Texas Constitution.\n\nA common Texas land grant size, discussed in James A. Michener's \"Texas\", was a \"labor and a league:\" a labor of good riparian land and a (square) league of land away from the river.\n\nThe (square) league is still encountered in modern real estate transactions.\n\nThe \"palmo\" (\"palm\") measured the distance between the tip of the thumb and the tip of the pinky finger with all fingers splayed. Its standardized value is (9 \"pulgadas\"). Half of a palmo in Castile was called the \"coto\", described as six fingers and defined as . The ancient Romans had a similar, smaller unit called the \"palmus\", which was .\n\nAlthough some standardisation was achieved with the law of 1801, particularly in defining the league as 6666⅔ \"varas\" long, varying measures continued to be used in various cities and regions.\n\n\n"}

Applicants submit a request to the hosts who will consider each application based on the applicant's track record, references, and location.\n\nThe D-Word has been criticized for this restrictive approach and for the use of an outdated conferencing platform. The hosts reacted to this by adding public discussions and building their own internet forum software (developed and maintained by co-host Peter Gerard) tailored to the needs of the membership.\n\nIn addition to the private community, The D-Word hosts week-long public discussions, moderated by the hosts, featuring guest experts from the documentary world. Past guests include Anand Patwardhan, Albert Maysles, Sandi Simcha DuBowski, Ross McElwee. These discussions remain archived on the public part of the site.\n\nThe D-Word's public discussions have explored topics such as \"Reaching a Wider Audience\" with Lance Weiler; a conference on the use of social networks like MySpace by filmmakers; a panel on new online distribution platforms for documentaries, and reactions by broadcasters to the broadband developments. Other conferences have focused on ethical issues in documentary practice (with Patricia Aufderheide of the Center for Social Media).\n\nThe D-Word works closely with documentary organisations like the European Documentary Network. In the past, public discussions were supported by the Independent Feature Project in New York.\n\nMembers regularly attend International Face 2 Face meetings at industry events such as the Sheffield International Documentary Festival, the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) or Silverdocs, close to Washington DC.\n\n"}
{"id": "4913527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4913527", "title": "The Hills Have Eyes 2", "text": "The Hills Have Eyes 2\n\nThe Hills Have Eyes 2 is a 2007 American horror film, and the sequel to the 2006 film which was a remake of the 1977 horror film. The film follows several U.S. Army National Guardsmen as they fight for survival against the mutant people living in a military base in the New Mexico desert. \"The Hills Have Eyes 2\" was directed by German film director Martin Weisz and written by father and son team Wes and Jonathan Craven. A graphic novel titled \"\" was published by Fox Atomic Comics to accompany the release of the film; it was released July 3, 2007. The film stars Michael McMillian, Jacob Vargas, Flex Alexander and Jessica Stroup.\n\nA captive woman, forced to breed mutant children, gives birth to a stillborn. She is then killed by mutant leader Papa Hades (Michael Bailey Smith) for being unable to provide healthy offspring. Later, scientists working in an area in the New Mexico desert, designated Sector 16, are attacked by the mutant Letch.\n\nA group of National Guardsmen in training are sent into the desert to resupply the scientists, who were working for the United States Department of Defense on installing a surveillance system (implied to be a result of the events in the first film). The soldiers arrive to find the camp apparently abandoned, and outside radio contact impossible due to the topography. When the radio operator, Spitter (Eric Edelstein), picks up a faint distress call, Sergeant Jeffrey “Sarge” Millstone (Flex Alexander) organizes a search and rescue mission, leaving behind Napoleon (Michael McMillian) and Amber (Jessica Stroup).\n\nThe search party discovers the mutilated body of a scientist in the hills, while Amber and Napoleon pull another dying scientist out of the portable toilet. On her way to join the group, Amber is attacked by the mutant Stabber (Tyrell Kemlo), but a returning Mickey (Reshad Strik) wards him off. Just as Napoleon catches up, Mickey is pulled into a bolt-hole and killed. At the same time, the remaining troops are attacked by Letch, and Sarge is accidentally killed by Spitter's friendly fire. Napoleon and Amber reunite with the group, and Spitter is killed by an unseen mutant sabotaging his rappelling gear as the others try to lower him down the hill. With their remaining gear stolen, they are forced to try to find another way down.\n\nThe remaining troops soon locate their commanding officer, who has clearly become unhinged from recent events. He warns them of the mutants' plans to capture women for breeding and kill everyone else. He then commits suicide after telling them the only way down the hill is through the mining caves. After the group kills Stabber, Missy is captured and taken into the mining caves by Chameleon. Chameleon attempts to rape her, but Missy fights him off, only to be captured by Hades, who scares Chameleon away and savagely rapes Missy himself. The remaining troops attempt to rescue Missy, with the exception of Stump (Ben Crowley), who is killed by Letch while attempting to climb down the hill without ropes. After being separated from Crank (Jacob Vargas) and Delmar (Lee Thompson Young), Napoleon and Amber cross paths with Chameleon, who they manage to kill. They later locate a non-violent mutant named Hansel (David Reynolds), while escaping Grabber (Gaspar Szabo). Grabber is killed by Crank after shooting Delmar. After reuniting with Napoleon and Amber, Delmar dies from his wounds, and Hansel leads Napoleon, Amber, and Crank to the exit. Along the way Crank is killed by a trapped crate of dynamite that he attempts to take with him, incidentally triggering an explosion.\n\nAfter killing Letch, Napoleon and Amber find the captive Missy, and all three fight Hades, whom they manage to kill as well. The three leave the mines, but a text blended into the screen states that the National Guard trainees remain missing and Sector 16 is still not acknowledged to exist. As the survivors prepare to depart, they are watched by an unknown mutant using their surveillance equipment.\n\n\n\"The Hills Have Eyes 2\" began filming in the summer of 2006 in Ouarzazate, Morocco, where the previous movie was filmed. The alternative title was The Hills Have Eyes 2: The Hills Still Have Eyes.\n\nWriter Wes Craven's initial inspiration for the film came during a casual conversation with producer Peter Locke. Craven envisioned that the previous film's character, Brenda (Emilie de Ravin), traumatized by her suffering during the events of \"The Hills Have Eyes\", joins the National Guard to overcome her fears. Barely finished with basic training, Brenda receives a call from her sergeant, who explains that they are sending a team back to the New Mexico desert to eradicate the remaining mutants. Her sergeant and the team need her, for she is the only one left alive who knows the mutants' location. Because of de Ravin's involvement in the television show \"Lost\", her schedule was unable to accommodate the filming of the sequel. Wes Craven replaced her character, but retained much of the original concept, including the group of National Guard soldiers in training.\n\nA one-minute teaser trailer was released on December 12, 2006. The teaser featured \"Insect Eyes,\" a song by indie folk recording artist Devendra Banhart. In addition to that, a series of clips with an introduction by Wes Craven and a small gallery can be found on the Fox Atomic website. Also on Fox Atomic is a soundless clip of the mutant Grabber attacking Amber.\n\nCraven originally looked at Michael J. Bassett, the director of \"Deathwatch\", to take over the directing role, but ultimately chose Martin Weisz after scheduling conflicts with Bassett. \"The Hills Have Eyes 2\" had a budget of $15 million.\n\nThe total gross at the box office of \"The Hills Have Eyes 2\" was $37.6 million.\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 12% based on reviews from 67 critics, and a rating average of 3.2 out of 10. \"TV Guide\" gives the film 1 star out of 5 stars. Film critic Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" wrote in his review which was printed in the \"Taipei Times\": \"The sequel of the remake of Wes Craven's \"The Hills have Eye's\" has mutated into a boring mess of a movie.\" Review aggregator Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 32% based on 10 reviews.\n\nCritic Matt Seitz of \"The New York Times\" wrote in his review: \"Wes Craven’s 1977 film, \"The Hills Have Eyes\", in which suburbanites battled mutant cannibals, was a pulpy parable of the thin line separating civilization from savagery. The 2006 remake \"The Hills Have Eyes\" was basically the same movie with glossier production values and a less satirical, more bludgeoning approach to violence. This follow-up — in which National Guard trainees are trapped on a former atomic test site and are stalked by flesh-eating freaks headquartered in a warrenlike mountain hideout — is essentially a catalog of transgressive images, lighted and edited like a heavy-metal video.\"\n\nScott Tobias of \"The A.V. Club\" wrote in his review: \"The premise for \"The Hills Have Eyes 2\", the quickie follow-up to Alexandre Aja's skillful but gratuitous 2006 remake of Craven's original, seems like a perfect opportunity to give the mutants their due, since it deploys a group of military people back to the scene of the crime. And yet it stupidly does the opposite, reducing the mutants to mine-dwelling freaks who murder and rape because, well, that's what they do. After a prologue so repugnant that it's unworthy of description, the film touches down in New Mexico's \"Sector 15\", where a handful of military technicians are busy installing a top-secret surveillance system. When a group of National Guard trainees are dispatched to the site to deliver equipment, they're shocked to discover the men either missing or dead, and they start combing the surrounding hills on a search-and-rescue mission. What they don't realize is that the mutants are luring them into various traps designed to kill the men and abduct the women for (ugh) breeding purposes. So it's up to these unseasoned and often downright inept soldiers to fight their way out of trouble. Directed by music-video veteran Martin Weisz—in the future, can producers please look elsewhere for talent?—\"The Hills Have Eyes 2\" assembles the most motley group of incompetents this side of a \"Police Academy\" movie, yet somehow misses the laughs.\"\n\n\"The Hills Have Eyes 2\" was released in theatres on March 23, 2007. The film was released on DVD on July 17, 2007, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. \"The Hills Have Eyes 2\" also grossed over $30 million in domestic DVD sales, for a total of $67,915,885.\n\nThe soundtrack was released on July 31, 2007 via Bulletproof Records.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5841680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5841680", "title": "Transnational organized crime", "text": "Transnational organized crime\n\nTransnational organized crime (TOC) is organized crime coordinated across national borders, involving groups or networks of individuals working in more than one country to plan and execute illegal business ventures. In order to achieve their goals, these criminal groups use systematic violence and corruption. The most commonly seen transnational organized crimes are money laundering; human smuggling; cyber crime; and trafficking of humans, drugs, weapons, kidnapping, people smuggling, endangered species, body parts, or nuclear material.\n\nPrior to World War I, several organizations were created to formalize international police cooperation, but most quickly failed, primarily because public police institutions were not sufficiently detached from the political centers of their respective states to function autonomously as expert bureaucracies. In 1914, the First International Criminal Police Congress was held in Monaco, which saw police officers, lawyers and magistrates from 24 countries meeting to discuss arrest procedures, identification techniques, centralized international criminal records and extradition proceedings. This organization appeared poised to avoid the political forces that ended earlier organizations, but the outbreak of World War I disorganized the Congress.\n\nIn 1923, a second International Criminal Police Congress was held in Vienna, on the initiative of Mr. Hans Schober, President of the Austrian police. Schober, eager to avoid the politics that doomed previous international police efforts, noted that \"ours is not a political but a cultural goal. It only concerns the fight against the common enemy of humankind: the ordinary criminal.\" This second Congress created the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC), which served as the direct forerunner of Interpol. Founding members included police officials from Russia, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Poland, China, Egypt, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. In 1926, the ICPC's General Assembly, held in Berlin, proposed that each country establish a central point of contact within its police structure: the forerunner of the National Central Bureau (NCB). In 1938, the Nazis assumed control of the ICPC and most countries stop participating, effectively causing the ICPC to cease to exist as an international organization.\n\nAfter World War II, Belgium led the rebuilding of the organization, with a new headquarters in Paris and a new name - Interpol. The United Nations did not recognize Interpol as an intergovernmental organization until 1971. On June 17, 1971, President Nixon declared \"America's public enemy number one in the United States is drug abuse. In order to fight and defeat this enemy, it is necessary to wage a new, all-out offensive.\" With this declaration, the United States began the War on Drugs. At the time, the flow of illicit narcotics into its borders was deemed a major risk to the health and safety of Americans, and as a result, enormous resources were spent in the effort to curtail both the supply of and demand for illegal drugs. In the three decades that followed President Nixon's declaration, drug trafficking served as the dominant form of what the United States and many of its allies viewed as transnational organized crime.\n\nIn recent years, that viewpoint has changed. The character of transnational organized crime has changed in three major ways since the war on drugs began. Drug trafficking has become more diversified, criminal networks have harnessed new methods of conducting business, and the structure of criminal networks has changed. Organized crime has gone global, giving way to the term transnational organized crime. Global governance has failed to keep pace with economic globalization. Antonio Maria Costa, former Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, effectively summarized the change in TOC over the last quarter century by saying, \"as unprecedented openness in trade, finance, travel and communication has created economic growth and well-being, it has also given rise to massive opportunities for criminals to make their business prosper.\"\n\nTransnational organized crime is widely opposed on the basis of a number of negative effects. It can undermine democracy, disrupt free markets, drain national assets, and inhibit the development of stable societies. In doing so, it has been argued, national and international criminal groups threaten the security of all nations. The victims of these transnational crime networks are governments that are unstable or not powerful enough to prevent them, with the networks conducting illegal activities that provide them with profits. Transnational organized crimes interrupt peace and stability of nations worldwide, often using bribery, violence, or terror to meet their needs.\n\nTOC is insufficiently understood, according to the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. In the most recent full-scale United Nations assessment of TOC, conducted in 2010, the Executive Director states, \"there is a lack of information on transnational criminal markets and trends. The few studies that exist have looked at sections of the problem, by sector or country, rather than the big picture. Without a global perspective there cannot be evidence-based policy.\" In response to the threat, law enforcement agencies have created a number of effective approaches for combating this transnational organized crime.\n\nLouise I. Shelley (Director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University) has said:\n\nTransnational crime will be a defining issue of the 21st century for policymakers - as defining as the Cold War was for the 20th century and colonialism was for the 19th. Terrorists and transnational crime groups will proliferate because these crime groups are major beneficiaries of globalization. They take advantage of increased travel, trade, rapid money movements, telecommunications and computer links, and are well positioned for growth.\n\nMost illicit trafficking begins or ends in the world's greatest economic powers, such as the G8 (forum). In other words, the world’s largest trading partners are also the world’s greatest markets for illicit goods and services. Many of these world powers have recently taken steps to combat TOC in a large, collective, international effort with partners and allies. Several organizations around the world have initiated efforts to combat TOC whose success or failure have yet to be determined.\n\nAccording to the UN Asia and Far East Institute (UNAFEI), combating transnational organized crime relies first and foremost on effective investigative techniques and prosecutorial tools. Three techniques in particular stand out as the most important in combating transnational organized crime: electronic surveillance, undercover operations, and the use of confidential informants (CIs), with electronic surveillance being the single most important and effective law enforcement tool against TOC. Electronic surveillance provides reliable, often irrefutable evidence of crimes through a participant's own words or image. This form allows law enforcement to learn of conspirators' plans before they are carried out and is particularly helpful in combating TOC because it enables law enforcement in any country to obtain evidence of co-conspirators in other countries. Obtaining evidence of conspiratorial planning internationally would otherwise be very difficult.\n\nAfter electronic surveillance, the second most important tool is undercover operations, Through undercover operations, law enforcement agents can infiltrate the highest levels of organized crime by posing as criminals themselves when real criminals discuss their plans and seek assistance in committing crimes. Over time, agents can gain the confidence of criminals and induce them to reveal information on past or ongoing criminal activities. followed by CIs refers to individuals who are not willing to testify but who provide information or assistance to law enforcement in exchange for money or lenient treatment for their own crimes and with the promise of confidentiality. In many cases, CIs are engaged in criminal activity themselves and can therefore provide valuable direct evidence regarding the criminal activities being conducted by their criminal associates. Such evidence frequently enables law enforcement officers to obtain warrants authorizing electronic surveillance. In rare cases, the court may order the disclosure of a CIs identity to a defendant, such as when the informant can provide evidence that may exculpate the defendant.\n\nThe following are some of the methods used by authorities in the US to combat transnational organised crime:\n\nIn May 2010, the White House released its National Security Strategy, detailing the need to aggressive combat transnational organized crime. This strategy document states, \"Combating transnational criminal and trafficking networks requires a multidimensional strategy that safeguards citizens, breaks the financial strength of criminal and terrorist networks, disrupts illicit trafficking networks, defeats transnational criminal organizations, fights government corruption, strengthens the rule of law, bolsters judicial systems, and improves transparency. While these are major challenges, the United States will be able to devise and execute a collective strategy with other nations facing the same threats.\"\n\nIn July 2011, the White House released its Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime, which reflects this change and sets forth a strategy \"to build, balance, and integrate the tools of American power to combat transnational organized crime and related threats to national security—and to urge our foreign partners to do the same.\" This strategy document set out five overarching policy objectives consistent with the vision and priorities of the National Security Strategy:\n\n\nIn keeping with the U.S. National Security Council's strategy to combat transnational organized crime, the National Guard Bureau established the CTOC Center of Excellence (COE) to educate and train Combatant Commands, military services, federal agencies, state and local law enforcement, and community leaders.\n\nAnother approach the United States takes in CTOC is the use of multijurisdictional task forces that combine investigative resources from several agencies so that the strength and sophistication of a task force's capabilities are greater than any single agency. Collaboration among law enforcement agencies is a key element in discovering possible links between local crimes and crimes with a transnational component.\n\nThe National Guard Bureau uses such an organization in CTOC. Its Multijurisdictional Counterdrug Task Force Training (MCTFT) program and its Western Regional Counterdrug Training Center provide the core of National Guard Bureau training and collaboration among law enforcement agencies at all levels.\n\n As the lead U.S. agency responsible for directing illicit trafficking detection and monitoring activities, U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) conducts operational and tactical activities in support of whole-of-government efforts to combat transnational organized crime in the maritime approaches to Central America. SOUTHCOM focuses on strengthening the security capacities of U.S. partners in Central America.\n\nAnother primary focus of SOUTHCOM CTOC efforts is supporting the interdiction of drug trafficking. SOUTHCOM collaborates with other agencies and nations to support CTOC efforts through detection & monitoring, information sharing, and partner nation capacity building.\n\nCharged with securing the United States, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plays an integral role in the U.S. efforts to combat transnational organized crime both at home and with partners abroad. DHS leverages and deploys numerous CTOC resources, while working closely with other federal, state and local agencies, foreign governments and partners in the private sector. Once TOC threats are identified, DHS works with partners to interdict them through strengthened interdiction, investigations, and prosecutions.\n\nThe Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), an agency of the Department of State, conducts CTOC operations at home and abroad by delivering justice and fairness and by strengthening police, courts, and corrections systems. These efforts reduce the amount of crime and illegal drugs reaching U.S. shores.\n\nINL CTOC efforts include helping foreign governments build effective law enforcement institutions that combat transnational organized crime, everything from money laundering, cybercrime, and intellectual property theft to trafficking in goods, people, weapons, drugs, or endangered wildlife. INL combats corruption by helping governments build transparent and accountable public institutions—a cornerstone of strong, stable, and fair societies that offer a level playing field for U.S. businesses abroad.\n\nEstablished in 1990, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) provides investigative support to law enforcement, intelligence, and regulatory agencies, cooperating globally with counterpart financial intelligence units (FIUs), and uses its regulatory authorities to make it more difficult for organized criminal groups to move money through the financial system. FinCEN supports the Department of the Treasury's efforts to promote the adoption of international standards involving anti-money laundering and the counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), including through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) where FinCEN led the delegation from 1994 through 1998. The National Security Council identified FinCEN as one of 34 Federal entities that it considered as having a significant role in the fight against international crime as noted in an August 2001 Government Accountability Office report.\n\nIn 2012, the Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on four key transnational organized crime groups: Camorra from Italy, Brothers' Circle from Russia, the Yamaguchi-gumi (Yakuza) from Japan, and Los Zetas from Mexico.\n\nThe strength and sophistication of a task force's capabilities will be stronger than any single agency's if the task force is multijurisdictional, combining investigative resources from several agencies. The key element in finding out possible links between local crimes and crimes with transnational component is collaboration among law enforcement agencies. To illustrate further, Operation Trifecta, a 19-month transnational investigation led by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), involved 9 Federal agencies and 67 State and local law enforcement agencies from 8 States. In 2003, it led to the arrests of some 240 individuals charged with transnational drug trafficking.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are employed by nation-states to counteract international organized crime. Serious international crime—such as crimes against humanity—may be investigated by the International Criminal Court, but that Court does not have the power to take suspects into custody, instead relying on the support of law enforcement and military force in relevant countries.\n\nOn November 15, 2000, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and is appointed to serve as the most significant mechanism for fighting TOC internationally. The first of its kind, the convention identified TOC as criminal actions that cannot be sufficiently combated by pacts tailored to a single commercial enterprise. The Ad Hoc Committee was established by the United Nations General Assembly to deal with this problem by taking a series of measures against transnational organized crime. These include the creation of domestic criminal offences to combat the problem, and the adoption of new, sweeping frameworks for mutual legal assistance, extradition, law-enforcement cooperation, and technical assistance and training.\n\nCombating TOC internationally proves difficult because so many governments and economies benefit enormously from TOC. For example, the Russia government benefits from money gained through cybercrime and through ties between TOC and it energy exporters. China’s economy also benefits from cybercrime as well as from counterfeiting. West African and Latin American politicians are either coerced by or maintain financially beneficial relationships with drug traffickers.\n\nUNTOC ability to help combat CTOC is compounded by its inability to directly assist countries that are incapable of adhering to the convention’s guidelines. Most countries agreed for a necessary, innovative, and more strategic approach at the 2010 conference of parties, yet to date no significant employment of tactics or policy has been determined. Voluntary contributions account for nearly all of UNODC’s funding and the organization suffers from chronic funding and staffing shortages. This limits UNODC’s overall effectiveness.\n\nThe UN General Assembly has also issued many resolutions to combat TOC; however, most have been ineffective because of their vagueness and irrelevancy.\n\nThe idea of the organization known today as Interpol was born at the first International Criminal Police Congress, held in Monaco in 1914. It was officially created in 1923 with the name, International Criminal Police Commission, and renamed in 1956 with the name, Interpol. Today, it is the largest international police organization in the world and is made up of 190 member nations. Each member nation staffs a national central bureau that communicates and cooperates with other member nations. Its mission is \"\"Preventing and fighting crime through enhanced cooperation and innovation on police and security matters\".\n\nAlthough the organization Interpol exists to coordinate intelligence efforts between national law enforcement agencies, it is not an international police force, and indeed no such international law enforcement body with universal jurisdiction exists.\n\nThe agency's number one priority is to maintain a secure global police information system between the National Central Bureaus of each member nation. In addition to this priority, Interpol provides round-the-clock support to police and law enforcement agencies of all member nations. It also continuously attempts to innovate and enhance the tools used to fight crime and it assists in the identification of crimes and criminals. Finally, it delivers high-level training, certification and accreditation to law enforcement personnel.\n\nLike most international CTOC organizations, Interpol suffers from continuously high levels of underfunding. In 2010, it operated on roughly $75 million budget. Since it holds no authority to conduct independent investigations or to arrest suspects, it is only as strong as the host country's police force.\n\nWith a membership of 188 nations, the World Bank is nearly the same size as Interpol (190) and although CTOC is not its primary mission, the World Bank does attempt to combat TOC by conducting assessments of anti-money laundering provisions and carrying out anti-corruption efforts. Its efforts are hindered, however, by the lack of concrete mandates and authorities. In a 2009 World Bank paper entitled, \"Slavery and Human Trafficking International Law and the Role of the World Bank\", the author states that \"the World Bank’s mandate appears to permit preventive action\", thereby lending doubt whether or not the World Bank is even permitted by UN mandate to involve itself in the fight against human trafficking.\n\nRecognizing the detrimental impact on its mission, the World Bank made a $1.5 billion pledge in 2011 to help combat TOC in the coming years.\n\nIn another CTOC initiative, the World Bank is partnered with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR). This initiative helps to recover corruption related proceeds by creating an effective and collaborative environment for global law enforcement policy development.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund also conducts assessments of anti-money laundering provisions in countries.\n\nEuropol is the law enforcement agency of the European Union (EU) whose main goal is to help achieve a safer Europe for the benefit of all EU citizens. The organization does so by assisting the EU Member States in their fight against serious international crime and terrorism.\n\nEuropol officers hold no authority to conduct arrests but they support EU law enforcement colleagues by gathering, analyzing and disseminating information and coordinating operations. Europol uses the information to prevent, detect and investigate offenses, and to track down and prosecute those who commit them. Europol experts and analysts take part in Joint Investigation Teams which help solve criminal cases on the spot in EU countries.\n\nThe Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), an initiative of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 by the Ministers of its Member jurisdictions. The objectives of the FATF are to \"set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.\" To this end, the FATF developed a number of recommendations that have been recognized by law enforcement agencies around the world as the standard in the combating of TOC; specifically in the fight against money laundering, terror financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nTo help combat CTOC, the FATF maintains a policy that has proven successful thus far, in which it \"names and shames\" that jurisdictions that choose to not cooperate with FATF. It also enlists the help of cooperating countries in the crafting of legislative frameworks used in the effort to combat money laundering.\n\nThe U.S. Military and Undercurrents in Asia-Pacific Security\n"}

{"id": "521616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=521616", "title": "£sd", "text": "£sd\n\n£sd (occasionally written Lsd, spoken as \"pounds, shillings and pence\" or pronounced /ɛlɛsˈdiː/ ell-ess-dee) is the popular name for the pre-decimal currencies once common throughout Europe, especially in the British Isles and hence in several countries of the British Empire and subsequently the Commonwealth. The abbreviation originates from the Latin currency denominations \"librae\", \"solidi\", and \"denarii\". In the United Kingdom, which was one of the last to abandon the system, these were referred to as \"pounds\", \"shillings\", and \"pence\" (\"pence\" being the plural of \"penny\").\n\nThis system originated in the classical Roman Empire. It was re-introduced into Western Europe by Charlemagne, and was the standard for many centuries across the continent. In Britain, it was King Offa of Mercia who adopted the Frankish silver standard of \"librae, solidi\" and \"denarii\" in the late 8th century, and the system was used in much of the British Commonwealth until the 1960s and 1970s, with Nigeria being the last to abandon it in the form of the Nigerian pound on 1 January 1973.\n\nUnder this system, there were 12 pence in a shilling and 20 shillings, or 240 pence, in a pound. The penny was subdivided into 4 farthings until 31 December 1960, when they ceased to be legal tender in the UK, and until 31 July 1969 there were also halfpennies (\"ha'pennies\") in circulation. The advantage of such a system was its use in mental arithmetic, as it afforded many factors and hence fractions of a pound such as tenths, eighths, sixths and even sevenths and ninths if the guinea (worth 21 shillings) was used. When dealing with items in dozens, multiplication and division are straightforward; for example, if a dozen eggs cost four shillings, then each egg was priced at fourpence.\n\nAs countries of the British Empire became independent, some abandoned the £sd system quickly, while others retained it almost as long as the UK itself. Australia, for example, only changed to using a decimal currency on 14 February 1966. Still others, notably Ireland, decimalised only when the UK did. The UK abandoned the old penny on Decimal Day, 15 February 1971, when one pound sterling became divided into 100 new pence. This was a change from the system used in the earlier wave of decimalisations in Australia, New Zealand, Rhodesia and South Africa, in which the pound was replaced with a new major currency called either the \"dollar\" or the \"rand\". The British shilling was replaced by a 5 new pence coin worth one-twentieth of a pound.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, £sd was the monetary system of most of the Commonwealth countries, the major exceptions being Canada and India.\n\nHistorically, similar systems based on Roman coinage were used elsewhere; e.g., the division of the \"livre tournois\" in France and other pre-decimal currencies such as Spain, which had 20 maravedís to 1 real and 20 reals to 1 duro or 5 pesetas.\n\nIn the classical Roman Empire, standard coinage was established to facilitate business transactions. 12 denarii were rated equal to 1 gold solidus – a 4th-century Roman coin that was rare but which still circulated; and, since 240 denarii were cut from one Roman \"libra\" of silver, 240 denarii therefore equalled one pound (\"livre\" in France, \"peso\" in Spain, etc.). Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, new currencies were introduced in Western Europe though (Eastern) Roman currencies remained popular. In the Eastern Roman Empire, the currencies gradually evolved away from the solidi and denarii.\n\nIn the eighth century, Charlemagne re-introduced and refined the system by decreeing that the money of the Holy Roman Empire should be the silver denarius, containing 22.5 grains of silver. As in the old Roman Empire, this had the advantage that any quantity of money could then be determined by counting (telling) coins rather than by weighing silver or gold.\n\nDifferent monetary systems based on units in ratio 20:1 & 12:1 (L:S & S:D) were widely used in Europe in medieval times. The English name \"pound\" is a Germanic adaptation of the Latin phrase \"libra pondo\" 'a pound weight'.\n\nThere were several ways to represent amounts of money in writing, with no formal convention:\n\n£2.3s.6d. (two pounds, three shillings and sixpence)\n<br>Unless there was cause to be punctilious, spoken: \"two pound(s), three and six\". Whether \"pound\" or \"pounds\" was used depended upon the speaker, varying with class, region and context.\n\n\nHalfpennies and farthings (quarter of a penny) were represented by the appropriate symbol ( for farthing, for halfpenny, or for three farthings) after the whole pence.\n\nA convention frequently used in retail pricing was to list prices over one pound all in shillings, rather than in pounds and shillings; for example, £4-18-0 would be written as 98/– (£4.90 in decimal currency). This is still seen in shilling categories of Scottish beer, such as 90/– beer.\n\nSometimes, prices of luxury goods and furniture were expressed by merchants in guineas, although the guinea coin had not been struck since 1799. A guinea was 21 shillings (£1.05 in decimal currency). Professionals such as lawyers and physicians, art dealers, and some others stated their fees in guineas rather than pounds, while, for example, salaries were stated in pounds per annum. Historically, at some auctions, the purchaser would bid and pay in guineas but the seller would receive the same number of pounds; the commission was the same number of shillings. Tattersalls, the main auctioneer of racehorses in the United Kingdom and Ireland, continues this tradition of conducting auctions in guineas. The vendor's commission is 5%. The word \"guineas\" is still found in the names of some British horse races, even though their prize funds are now fixed in pounds – such as the 1,000 Guineas and 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse.\n\nA threepenny bit (pronounced thrupney bit) was known as a \"tickey\" in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. In Australia it was known as a tray (also spelt trey), or a tray bit, from the French \"trois\" meaning three.\n\nFourpence was often known as a \"groat\", although the coin of that name was withdrawn in the 19th century.\n\nA sixpenny bit was a \"tanner\", known in Australia as a \"zack\". One shilling was a \"bob\", and a pound a \"nicker\" or a \"quid\". The term \"quid\" is said to originate from the Latin phrase quid pro quo. A pound note was also sometimes called simply \"a note\" (e.g., \"You owe me 50 notes\").\n\nA ten-shilling note was sometimes known as \"half a bar\".\n\nA two-shillings-and-sixpence piece, in use until the introduction of decimal currency, was known as \"half a crown\" or \"a half crown\". Crown coins (with a value of five shillings) were latterly issued only as commemorative pieces.\n\nA two-shilling piece known as a florin (an early attempt at decimalisation, being , and equal to 10 new pence after decimalisation) was in everyday use; it was referred to as \"two bob\", a \"two-shilling bit\", or a \"two-bob-bit\".\n\nThe currency of Lancre, a kingdom in the fictional world of Discworld, is a parody of the £sd system.\n\nThe currency of knuts, sickles and galleons in the Harry Potter books is also a parody of the £sd system, with 29 knuts to a sickle and 17 sickles to a galleon.\n\nLysergic acid diethylamide was sometimes called \"pounds, shillings and pence\" during the 1960s, because of the abbreviation LSD. The English rock group The Pretty Things released a 1966 single titled \"£.s.d.\" that highlighted the double entendre. The Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment called the first field trial with LSD as a chemical weapon \"Moneybags\" as a pun.\n\nThe score of 26 at darts (one dart in each of the top three spaces) was sometimes called \"half-a-crown\" as late as the 1990s, though this did start to confuse the younger players. 26 is also referred to as \"Breakfast\", since 2/6 or half a crown was the standard cost for breakfast pre-decimalisation.\n\nEven today, and for all time, bank notes that are no longer legal tender, including those that were issued pre-decimalisation, are exchangeable for their face value (regardless of the possible greater worth if sold or auctioned) if they are taken directly (or posted) to the Bank of England building in Threadneedle Street, London. The last £sd coins to cease being legal tender in the UK after decimal day were the Sixpence (withdrawn 1980), the Shilling (withdrawn 1991) and the Florin (withdrawn 1993). In Australia, as of 2018, these coins can still be found in circulation occasionally as 5, 10 and 20 cent coins. The last £sd bank note to cease to be legal tender anywhere in the world was the Isle of Man ten shilling note, which ceased to be legal tender there in 2013.\n\n\n"}
