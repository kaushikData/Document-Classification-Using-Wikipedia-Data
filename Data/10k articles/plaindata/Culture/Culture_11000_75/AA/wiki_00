OHSU named the monkey ANDi because it stands for “inserted DNA” spelled backward.\n\nANDi was born with an extra glowing gene called green fluorescent protein (GFP). This GFP gene, which is naturally occurring in jellyfish, was taken from a jellyfish and genetically added to ANDi’s DNA sequence through his chromosomes. OHSU used rhesus monkeys because they share 95% of the same genes as humans.\n\nDuring the method in which ANDi was created, two hundred and twenty-four eggs were injected with the protein and only 166 or 75% were successfully fertilized. 126 or 76% of these fertilized eggs developed to the four-cell-stage embryos. 40 of the fertilized embryos were implanted in 20 surrogate rhesus mothers, each carrying two embryos. 5 of the surrogates became pregnant. From these five surrogates, three live births proceeded. In these three monkey births only one infant, ANDi, carried the transgene. Research team leader Gerald Schatten said the technique that created ANDi would become a vital tool for scientists investigating therapies for human diseases.\n\nBy being able to genetically modify a monkey, a new breakthrough in technology was formed. ANDi was created in the hope of finding a cure for complicated human diseases such as cancer. Since ANDi was born, scientists want to introduce more significant DNA changes. Scientists are looking to make genetic modifications such as those that would make primates closely mimic human diseases like breast cancer or HIV. Scientists also want to try to study and cure other diseases through trans genetics such as Alzheimer's, AIDS, and diabetes.\n\nAlthough ANDi is a carrier of the gene it does not appear to be functional - ANDi does not actually glow.\n\n"}

In common with most British universities, a graduand of the Robert Gordon University begins the ceremony wearing the dress of the degree to which they are being admitted except for the hood. This is in contrast to the practice at some universities such as Oxford where a graduand only dons the dress of a degree \"after\" it has been conferred. The current pattern of academic dress dates from 1992 when the institution became a university.\n\nFor all bachelor's degrees (e.g. BA, BSc, etc.) and integrated Masters (e.g. MPharm, MEng etc.) a black gown is worn, ending 12 inches (30 cm) from the ground. For all other master's degrees except MPhil (e.g. MSc, MBA), a black gown is worn, ending 8 inches (20 cm) from the ground, while for MPhil the gown is the same but also has facings of white silk 2.5 inches (6 cm) in width. For Doctoral degrees (e.g. PhD), the Doctor's black robe (a black Panama gown) is worn; the Doctor's robe has front edges and sleeves in white silk. The Chancellor's robe is of black silk with front edges and fringes of pale gold, while the Principal/Vice-Chancellor's gown is the same but with front edges and fringes in white. For higher doctorates (including honorary doctorate), the robe is scarlet with white front edges.\n\nAll hoods are black and white and do not vary in colour by academic discipline, and all are of Cambridge shape. The hood is only put on after the degree has been awarded. For all bachelor's degrees, the hood is black, partially lined with white silk embossed with symbols from the University's coat of arms (the castle, torch, and mechanical cog) and has a black square backpiece (known as the \"cape\"). For master's degrees, the hood is black and fully lined and edged in white silk embossed with the same symbols from the coat of arms, and the cape also edged in white silk 0.5 inches (1.25 cm) in width . For Doctoral degrees the hood is as for master's degrees but with a 1-inch (2.5 cm) band of white silk around the cape, while for higher doctorates and honorary doctorates the hood is scarlet and lined with white silk. For all bachelor's and master's degrees, headdress is a plain black mortarboard while for Doctoral degrees, headdress consists of a black Tudor bonnet with white cord and tassels. Recipients of higher doctorates and honorary doctorates wear the same bonnet but with gold cord and tassels.\n"}
{"id": "903360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=903360", "title": "Anarchist symbolism", "text": "Anarchist symbolism\n\nAnarchists have employed certain symbols for their cause, including most prominently the circle-A (Ⓐ) and the black flag (⚑), although anarchists have historically largely denied the importance of symbols to political movement. Since the revival of anarchism around the start of the 21st century and concurrent with the rise of the anti-globalization movement, anarchist cultural symbols are widely present.\n\nThe red flag was one of first anarchist symbols and it was widely used in late 19th century by anarchists worldwide. Peter Kropotkin preferred the use of the red flag. \nUse of the red flag by anarchists disappeared after the October Revolution, when red flags started to be associated only with communist parties and bureaucratic, reformist and authoritarian social democracy.\n\nThe black flag and the color black in general have been associated with anarchism since the 1880s. Many anarchist collectives contain the word \"black\" in their names. There have been a number of anarchist periodicals entitled \"Black Flag\".\n\nThe uniform blackness of the flag is in stark contrast to the colorful flags typical of most nation states. Additionally, as a white flag has been used to request parley or to surrender, the black flag symbolizes defiance and opposition to surrender.\n\nThe black flag represents the absence of a flag and thus stands in opposition to the very notion of nation states. In that light, the flag can be seen as a rejection of the concept of representation, or the idea that any person or institution can adequately represent a group of individuals. Modern anarchism has a shared ancestry with—amongst other ideologies—socialism, a movement strongly associated with the red flag. As anarchism became more and more distinct from socialism in the 1880s, it adopted the black flag in an attempt to differentiate itself. Some anarchists at the time, such as Peter Kropotkin, preferred to continue using the red flag rather than adopt the black.\n\nThe black flag first became associated with anarchism in the 1880s. The French anarchist paper, \"Le Drapeau Noir\" (\"The Black Flag\"), which existed until 1882, is one of the first published references to use black as an anarchist color. Black International was the name of a London anarchist group founded in July 1881. Louise Michel, participant in the Paris Commune of 1871, flew the black flag during demonstration of the unemployed in Paris in March 1883. An open-air meeting of the unemployed was broken up by the police and around 500 demonstrators, with Michel at the front carrying a black flag and shouting \"Bread, work, or lead!\" marched off towards the boulevard Saint-Germain. The crowd pillaged three baker's shops before the police attacked. Michel was arrested and sentenced to six years solitary confinement. Public pressure soon forced the granting of an amnesty. According to Michel, the \"black flag is the flag of strikes and the flag of those who are hungry\".\n\nThe black flag soon made its way to the United States. The black flag was displayed in Chicago at an anarchist demonstration in November 1884. According to the English language newspaper of the Chicago anarchists, it was \"the fearful symbol of hunger, misery and death\".\n\nThe colors black and red have been used by anarchists since at least the late 1800s, when they were used on cockades by Italian anarchists in the 1864 Bologna insurrection, and in 1877 when anarchists entered the Italian town Letino carrying red and black flags to promote the First International. Diagonally divided red and black flags were popularized during the Spanish Civil War by the anarcho-syndicalist labor union CNT, and are used to this day by anarchist organizations. Similar flags but with different colors are commonly used to represent specific anarchist ideologies, such as black and purple for anarcha-feminism, black and green for green anarchism, and black and orange for mutualism.\n\nThe circle-A is almost certainly the best-known present-day symbol for anarchy. It is a monogram that consists of the capital letter \"A\" surrounded by the capital letter \"O\". The letter \"A\" is derived from the first letter of \"anarchy\" or \"anarchism\" in most European languages and is the same in both Latin and Cyrillic scripts. The \"O\" stands for order and together they stand for \"society seeks order in anarchy\" (), a phrase written by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in his 1840 book \"What Is Property?\".\n\nThe circle-A long predates the anarcho-punk movement, which was part of the punk rock movement of the late 1970s. However, the punk movement helped spread the circle-A symbol more widely and helped raise awareness of it among non-anarchists. This process began with the use of anarchist imagery when members of the band Crass became aware of the symbol while traveling through France.\n\n"}

{"id": "1936899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936899", "title": "Blue–green distinction in language", "text": "Blue–green distinction in language\n\nMany languages do not distinguish between what in English are described as \"blue\" and \"green\" and instead use a cover term spanning both. To describe this English lexical gap, linguists use the portmanteau word \"grue\", from \"green\" and \"blue\", which the philosopher Nelson Goodman coined in his 1955 \"Fact, Fiction, and Forecast\" to illustrate the \"new riddle of induction\".\n\nThe exact definition of \"blue\" and \"green\" may be complicated by the speakers not primarily distinguishing the hue, but using terms that describe other color components such as saturation and luminosity, or other properties of the object being described. For example, \"blue\" and \"green\" might be distinguished, but a single term might be used for both if the color is dark. Furthermore, green might be associated with yellow, and blue with black or gray.\n\nAccording to Brent Berlin and Paul Kay's 1969 study \"\", distinct terms for brown, purple, pink, orange and grey will not emerge in a language until the language has made a distinction between green and blue. In their account of the development of color terms the first terms to emerge are those for white/black (or light/dark), red and green/yellow.\n\nThe word for blue in Amazigh language is \"Azerwal\". In some dialects of Amazigh, like Shilha, the word \"Azegzaw\" is used for both green and blue.\n\nThe color of the sky is sometimes referred to as \"the green\" in Classical Arabic poetry, in which it is al-khaḍrā' (). In Arabic the word for blue is generally \"azraq\" (). The Arabic word for green is \"akhḍar\" ().\n\nIn Moroccan Arabic, the word for light blue is \"šíbi\", whereas \"zraq\" () stands for blue and \"khḍar\" () for green. The word \"zrag\" () is used to describe the color of a suffocated person, and is also used pejoratively as synonym to \"dumb\".\n\nThe ancient Egyptian word \"wadjet\" covers the range of blue, blue-green, and green. On the one hand, it was the name of a goddess, the patroness of Lower Egypt, represented as a cobra called Wadjet, \"the green one,\" or as the Eye of Horus, also called by the same name. On the other hand, \"wedjet\" was the word used for Egyptian blue in faience ceramics.\n\nIn Hebrew, the word \" (pronounced ) means blue, while \" (pronounced ) means green and has the same root, (j-r-q), as the word for vegetables (, ). However, in classical Hebrew, can mean both green and yellow, giving rise to such expressions as (pronounced ), \"leek green\", to specify green to the exclusion of yellow. \nLike Russian and Italian, Hebrew has a separate name for light blue (, \"t'khelet\")—the color of the sky and of fringes on the ritual garment \"Tzitzit\". This color has special symbolic significance in Judaism and Jewish culture.\n\nAlbanian has two major words for \"blue\": \"kaltër\" refers to a light blue, such as that of the sky, but it is derived from Vulgar Latin \"calthinus\", itself derived from \"caltha\", a loan from Ancient Greek that meant \"marigold\" a small and in fact yellow flower. The other word, \"blu\", refers to a darker shade of blue, and like many similar words across many European languages, derives ultimately from Germanic (see also: Italian \"blu\"). There is a separate word for green, \"gjelbër\", which derives from the Latin \"galbinus\", which originally meant \"yellow\"; the original Latin word for green on the other hand, \"viridis\", is the source of the Albanian word for \"yellow\", \"verdhë\".\n\nThere are separate words for green (\"zaļš\") and blue (\"zils\") in Latvian. Both \"zils\" and \"zaļš\" stem from the same Proto-Indo-European word for yellow (\"*ghel\"). Several other words in Latvian have been derived from these colors, namely grass is called \"zāle\" (from \"zaļš\"), while the name for iris is \"zīlīte\" (from \"zils\").\n\nThe now archaic word \"mēļš\" was used to describe both dark blue and black (probably indicating that previously \"zils\" was used only for lighter shades of blue). For instance, blueberries and blackberries are called \"mellenes\".\n\nIn Latvian black is \"melns\" (in some local dialects \"mells\").\n\nIn Lithuanian \"žalias\" is green, \"mėlynas\" is blue and \"žilas\" is grey (hair), grizzled.\n\nBulgarian, a South Slavic language, makes a clear distinction between blue (синьо, \"sinyo\"), green (зелено, \"zeleno\"), and black (черно, \"cherno\").\n\nIn the Polish language, blue (\"niebieski\" from \"niebo\" – sky) and green (\"zielony\") are treated as separate colors. The word for sky blue or azure—\"błękitny\"—might be considered either a basic color or a shade of blue by different speakers. Similarly dark blue or navy blue (\"granatowy\"—deriving from the name of pomegranate (granat), some cultivars of which are dark purplish blue in color) can be considered by some speakers as a separate basic color. Black (\"czarny\") is completely distinguished from blue. As in English, Polish distinguishes pink (\"różowy\") from red (\"czerwony\").\n\nThe word \"siwy\" means blue-gray in Polish (literally it means the color of gray hair). The word \"siny\" refers to violet-blue and is used to describe the color of bruises (\"siniaki\"), hematoma, and the blue skin discoloration that can result from moderate hypothermia.\n\nRussian does not have a single word referring to the whole range of colors denoted by the English term \"blue\". Instead, it traditionally treats light blue (голубой, \"goluboy\") as a separate color independent from plain or dark blue (синий, \"siniy\"), with all seven \"basic\" colors of the spectrum (red–orange–yellow–green–голубой / \"goluboy\" (sky blue, light azure, but \"does not equal\" cyan)–синий / \"siniy\" (\"true\" deep blue, like synthetic ultramarine)–violet) while in English the light blues like azure and cyan are considered mere shades of \"blue\" and not different colors.\nTo better understand this, consider that English makes a similar distinction between \"red\" and light red (pink, which is considered a different color and not merely a kind of red), but such a distinction is unknown in several other languages; for example, both \"red\" ( / , \"hóng\") and \"pink\" (, \"fěn hóng\", lit. \"powder red\") have traditionally been considered varieties of a single color in Chinese. The Russian language also distinguishes between red (красный, krasniy) and pink (розовый, rozoviy).\n\nSimilarly English descriptions of rainbows have often distinguished between blue or turquoise and indigo, the latter of which is often described as dark blue or ultramarine.\n\nThe Serbo-Croatian color system makes a distinction between blue, green and black:\n\n\n\"Modra\" may also mean dark purple and is used to describe a bruise, \"modrica\". Native speakers cannot pinpoint a color on the spectrum which would correspond to \"modra\".\n\n\"Sinje\", analogue to Bulgarian синьо, \"sinyo\"/Russian синий, \"siniy\", is archaic, and denotes blue-gray, usually used to describe dark skies or seas.\n\n\"Mrka\" \"dusky\" can refer either to dark grey or dark brown, or even black. It is etymologically derived from the word for \"darkness\" (\"mrak\"), but it is distinct from \"dark\" (\"taman\").\n\nTurquoise is usually described as \"tirkizna\", and similarly, azure will use a loan word \"azurna\". There is no specific word for cyan. Blond hair is called \"plava\" ('blue'), reflecting likely the archaic use of \"plav\" for any bright white/blue colors (like the sky).\n\nShades are defined with a prefix (e.g. \"tamno-\" for dark, or \"svetlo-\" for light), for example, dark blue = \"tamnoplava\".\n\nThe Welsh word \"glas\" is usually translated as \"blue\"; however, it can also refer, variously, to the color of the sea, of grass, or of silver (cf. greek γλαυκός). The word \"gwyrdd\" (a borrowing from Latin \"viridis\") is the standard translation for \"green\". In traditional Welsh (and related languages), \"glas\" could refer to certain shades of green and grey as well as blue, and \"llwyd\" could refer to various shades of grey and brown; however, modern Welsh is tending toward the 11-color Western scheme, restricting \"glas\" to blue and using \"gwyrdd\" for green, \"llwyd\" for grey and \"brown\" for brown.\n\nIn Modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic the word for \"blue\" is \"gorm\" (whence the name Cairngorm mountains derives) – a borrowing of the now obsolete Early Welsh word \"gwrm\", meaning \"dark blue\" or \"dusky\". A relic of the original meaning (\"dusky\") survives in the Irish term \"daoine gorma\", meaning \"Black people\".\nIn Old and Middle Irish, like in Welsh, \"glas\" was a blanket term for colors ranging from green to blue to various shades of grey (e.g. the \"glas\" of a sword, the \"glas\" of stone, etc.). In Modern Irish, it has come to mean various shades of green, with specific reference to plant hues, and grey (like the sea); other shades of green would be referred to in Modern Irish as \"uaine\" or \"uaithne\", while \"liath\" is grey proper (like a stone).\n\nScottish Gaelic uses the term \"uaine\" for \"green\". However, the dividing line between it and \"gorm\" is somewhat different than between the English \"green\" and \"blue\", with \"uaine\" signifying a light green or yellow-green, and \"gorm\" extending from dark blue (what in English might be navy blue) to include the dark green or blue-green of vegetation. Grass, for instance, is \"gorm\", rather than \"uaine\". In addition, \"liath\" covers a range from light blue to light grey. However, the term for a green apple, such as a Granny Smith, would be \"ubhal glas\".\n\nThe boundary between colors varies much more than the \"focal point\": e.g. an island known in Breton as \"Enez glas (\"the blue island\")\" is called in French \"l'Île Verte (\"the green island\")\", in both cases referring to the greyish-green color of its bushes, even though both languages distinguish green (as in lawn grass) from blue (as in a cloudless midday sky).\n\nThe Romance terms for \"green\" (Catalan ', French ', Italian, Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish ') are all from Latin '. The terms for \"blue\", on the other hand, vary: Catalan ', Occitan ', French ' and Italian ' come from a Germanic root, whereas the Spanish and Portuguese \"azul\" is likely to come from Arabic. French \"bleu\" was in turn loaned into many other languages, including English. Latin itself did not have a word covering all shades of blue, which may help explain these borrowings. It did, however, recognise ' (dark blue, sometimes greenish), and ' (greyish blue, like lead).\n\nFrench, as most Romance languages, makes roughly the same distinctions as English and has a specific term for each of blue (\"), green (\") and grey (\"\"). For all three, different shades can be indicated with different (compound) terms, none of them being considered as basic color terms: \"bleu \" (light blue), \"bleu \" (sky blue), \"bleu \" (Navy blue), \"bleu \" (royal blue); \"vert clair\" (light green), \"vert \" (literally: apple green); \"gris \" (very dark grey), \"gris \" (literally: mouse grey). French also uses \"\" for the lighter shade of blue of the sunny sky, that was in turn loaned to English as \"azure\".\n\nCatalan distinguishes blue (') from green (') and grey ('). Other basic or common colors by its own right are ' \"purple\", ' \"yellow\", ' \"orange\", ' \"red\", ' \"pink\", ' \"brown\", ' \"grey\", ' \"black\" and ' \"white\". For all these colors except black and white it is possible to indicate different shades using ' \"light\" and ' \"dark\"; for blue, though, it generally is \"blau cel\" \"sky blue\" and \"blau marí\" \"sea blue\". Other words and compounds are common to indicate more elaborated shades (\"verd llimona\" \"lemon green\", \"rosa pàlid\" \"pale pink\", \"lila\" \"lilac\", \"granat\" \"carmine\", \"ocre\" \"ochre\", \"verd oliva\" \"olive green\", etc.). Catalan actually distinguishes two reds with different and common words: while ' refers to the color of arterial blood, ' is a red tending towards yellow or the color of clay.\n\nItalian distinguishes blue ('), green (') and grey ('). There are also common words for light blue (e.g. the color of the cloudless sky): ' and ', and other for darker shades, e.g. ', indigo. ', the English equivalent of azure, is usually considered a separate basic color rather than a shade of \"blu\" (similar to the distinction in English between red and pink). Some sources even go to the point of defining \"blu\" as a darker shade of \"azzurro\". \"Celeste\" literally means '(the color) of the sky' and can be used as synonym of \"azzurro\", although it will more often be considered a less saturated hue. ' (aquamarine) literally \"sea water\", indicates an even lighter, almost transparent, shade of blue. To indicate a mix of green and blue, Italians might say \"verde \", literally \"water green\". The term ', not common in standard italian and perceived as a literary term, is used in scientific contexts (esp. botany) to indicate a mix of blue, green and gray. Other similar terms are ' and \"\" (turquoise/teal); they are more saturated hues (especially turchese) and differ in context of use: the first is a literary or bureaucratic term (used for example to indicate light green eyes in identity cards); the second is more common in any informal speech, along with the variant \"turchino\" (for instance, the fairy of The Adventures of Pinocchio is called \"fata turchina\").\n\nIn Portuguese, the word \" means blue and the word \" means green. Furthermore, \"azul-\" means light-blue, and \"azul-\" means dark-blue. More distinctions can be made between several hues of blue. For instance, \"azul-\" means sky blue, \"azul-\" means navy-blue and \"azul-\" means turquoise-blue. One can also make the distinction between \"verde-claro\" and \"verde-escuro\", meaning light and dark-green respectively, and more distinctions between several qualities of green: for instance, \"verde-\" means olive-green and \"verde-\" means emerald-green. Cyan is usually called \"azul-celeste\" (sky blue) or \"azul-\", meaning pool blue, but also less commonly \"\", and \"verde-\", meaning water green.\n\nRomanian clearly distinguishes between the colors green (') and blue ('). It also uses separate words for different hues of the same color, e.g. light blue ('), blue (\"albastru\"), dark-blue (\"bleu-\" or '), along with a word for turquoise (') and azure (' or \").\n\nSimilarly to French, Romanian, Italian and Portuguese, Spanish distinguishes blue (') and green (') and has an additional term for the tone of blue visible in the sky, namely \", which is nonetheless considered a shade of blue.\n\nIn Old Norse, the word ' \"blue\" (from proto-Germanic ) was also used to describe black (and the common word for people of African descent was thus ' 'blue/black men'). In Swedish, \"\", the modern word for blue, was used this way until the early 20th century, and it still is to a limited extent in modern Faroese.\n\nGerman and Dutch distinguish blue (respectively ' and ') and green (' and ') very similarly to English. There are (compound) terms for light blue (' and ') and darker shades of blue (' and '). In addition, adjective forms of most traditional color names are inflected to match the corresponding noun's case and gender.\n\nThe terms for \"blue\" and \"green\" have changed completely in the transition from Ancient Greek to Modern Greek. Ancient Greek had γλαυκός (\"glaukós\") \"clear light blue\", also with a turquoise/teal/green hue (it was a typical term for goddess Athena's eyes, portrayed in green or light blue) contrasting with χλωρός (\"khlōrós\") \"bright green\" but also \"acid yellow\" (cf. words such as chlorophyll). κυανός (\"kuanós\", which turned into \"cyan\" in English) meant either a \"dark blue/green substance\" or just \"blue\".\n\nWe know the terms changed in Byzantine Era through the name of two political factions of Constantinople: the Green ones (Πράσινοι) and the Blue ones (Bένετοι); we don't know if the names of those groups influenced the change or if they have been named from the new color terms.\n\nModern Greek has πράσινο (\"prásino\") for green and γαλάζιο (\"galázio\") or θαλασσί (\"thalassí\", 'sea colored') for light blue/sea blue: the previous term for blue is therefore disappeared. \nThe recent loan μπλε (\"mple\", from French \"bleu\") is used for blue.\nIn the Modern Greek language, there are additional names for light and dark blues/greens:\n\nAs a rule, the first two words of the list are accepted as shades of blue, and the rest as shades of green. Also βιολέ (\"violé\") / βιολετί (\"violetí\") for violet blue (which is, however, usually considered as a shade of purple, rather than blue).\n\nOssetian has one word for blue, light blue and green—цъæх (tsəh), which also means \"grey\" and \"glaucous\"—but it also has a separate word for green, кæрдæгхуыз (kərdəghuɨz), literally \"grassy\" (from кæрдæг \"grass\"). The latter derives from кæрдын (kərdɨn) \"to mow\" (like in German \"Heu\" (\"hau\") < \"hauen\" (to mow)).\n\nOssetian also has separate words for these colors:\n\nPashto uses the word \"shīn\" to denote blue as well as green. \"Shinkay\", a word derived from \"shīn\", means 'greenery' but \"shīn āsmān\" means 'blue sky'. When there is ambiguity, it is common to ask (as in Vietnamese), \"\"Shīn\" like the sky? Or \"shīn\" like plants?\"\n\nPersian words for blue include \"ābi\" (literally the color of water, from \"āb\" 'water'), for blue generally; \"nili\" (from \"nil\", 'indigo dye'), for deeper shades of blue such as the color of rain clouds; \"fayruzeh\" 'turquoise stone', used to describe the color of blue eyes; \"lājvardi\" or \"lāzhvardi\" 'lapis lazuli color', source of the words \"lazuli\" and \"azure\"; \"nilufari\" 'water lily color'; and \"kabud\", an old literary word for 'blue'.\n\nThe Persian word for green is \"sabz\". As in Sudan, dark-skinned people may be described as \"green\".\n\nThe color of the sky is variously described in Persian poetry using the words \"sabz\", \"fayruzeh\", \"nil\", \"lājvardi\", or \"nilufari\"— literally \"green\", \"indigo\", \"turquoise\", \"azure\" or \"the color of water lilies\". For example, \"sabz-ākhor\" \"green stable\", \"sabz-āshyāneh\" \"green ceiling\", \"sabz-ayvān\" \"green balcony\", \"sabz-bādbān\" \"green sail\", \"sabz-bāgh\" \"green garden\", \"sabz-farsh\" \"green carpet\", \"sabz-golshan\" \"green flower-garden\", \"sabz-kārgāh\" \"green workshop\", \"sabz-kh\"\"ān\" \"green table\", \"sabz-manzareh\" \"green panorama\", \"sabz-maydān\" \"green field\" \"sabz-pol\" \"green bridge\", \"sabz-tāq\" \"green arch\", \"sabz-tasht\" \"green bowl\", and \"sabz-tā'us\" \"green peacock\" are poetic epithets for the sky—in addition to similar compounds using the words for blue, e.g. \"lājvardi-saqf\" \"lapis lazuli-colored roof\" or \"fayruzeh-tasht\" \"turquoise bowl\". Moreover, the words for green of Arabic origin \"akhzar\" and \"khazrā\" are used for epithets of the sky or heaven, such as \"charkh-e akhzar\" \"green wheel\".\n\nIndo-Aryan languages distinguish blue from green. In Urdu, blue is نیلا (\"nīlā\") and green is سبز (\"sabz\"). There are some names of shades of blue as well, like فیروزی (\"ferozī\") \"turquoise\".\nIn Hindi, blue is नीला (\"nīlā\") and green is हरा (\"harā\").\nIn Marathi, blue is निळा (\"niḽā\") and green is हिरवा (\"hiravā\").\n\nIn the Basque language there are three native color words derived from \"ur\" (water). \"Urdin\", is nowadays used in most cases for blue. \"Ubel\", originally meant flash flood and, with respect to colors, is often used in relation to bruises. \"Begi ubela\" would be translated into English by \"a black and blue eye\". But in Basque, unlike English, ubel remains in use after the hit skin has lost its purple color and become pale, why this word is used for both purple in particular and pale hue in general. \"Uher\", originally meant dirty, still water or rusty and is used for gray or sienna tones or impure, dark color in general. Green is usually expressed with the loan-word \"berde\" from Spanish \"verde\"/ French \"vert\". The authenticity of the less common Basque terms for green \"(h)orlegi\" and \"musker\" is disputed.\n\nFinnish makes a distinction between \"vihreä\" (green) and \"sininen\" (blue). Turquoise or teal (\"turkoosi\" or \"sinivihreä\") is considered to be a separate, intermediate color between green and blue, and black (\"musta\") is also differentiated from blue.\n\nThe name for blue, \"sininen\", is shared with other Finnic languages and is thus dated to the era of the Proto-Finnic language (ca. 5000 years old). However, it is also shared with the unrelated Russian language (синий, \"siniy\"), suggesting that it is a loanword. (Alternatively, the Russian word синий could represent Finnic substratum). The word \"vihreä\" (\"viher-\", archaic \"viheriä\", \"viheriäinen\") is related to \"vehreä\" \"verdant\" and \"vihanta\" \"green\", and \"viha\" \"hate\", originally \"poison\". It is not shared with Estonian, in which it is \"roheline\", probably related with the Estonian word \"rohi\" \"grass\". However, the form \"viha\" does have correspondences in related languages as far as Permic languages, where it means not only \"poison\" but \"bile\" or \"green or yellow\". It has been originally loaned from an Indo-Iranian protolanguage and is related to Latin \"virus\" \"poison\". Furthermore, the word \"musta\" \"black\" is also of Finnic origin.\n\nThe differentiation of several colors by hue is at least Finnic (a major subgroup of Uralic) in origin. Before this, only red (\"punainen\") was clearly distinguished by hue, with other colors described in terms of brightness (\"valkea\" vs. \"musta\"), using non-color adjectives for further specificity. Alternatively, it appears that the distinction between \"valkea\" and \"musta\" was in fact \"clean, shining\" vs. \"dirty, murky\". The original meaning of \"sini\" was possibly either \"black/dark\" or \"green\". Mauno Koski's theory is that dark colors of high saturation—both blue and green—would be \"sini\", while shades of color with low saturation, such as dark brown or black, would be \"musta\". Although it is theorized that originally \"vihreä\" was not a true color name and was used to describe plants only, the occurrence of \"vihreä\" or \"viha\" as a name of a color in several related languages shows that it was probably polysemic (meaning both \"green\" and \"verdant\") already in early Baltic-Finnic. However, whatever the case with these theories, differentiation of blue and green must be at least as old as the Baltic-Finnic languages.\n\nHungarian makes the distinction between green (\"zöld\") and blue (\"kék\"), and also distinguishes black (\"fekete\"). Intermediate colors between green and blue are commonly referred to as \"zöldeskék\" (literally greenish-blue) or \"kékeszöld\" (bluish-green), but names for specific colors in this continuum—like turquoise (\"türkiz\")—also exist. Particular shades of a color can also have separate names, such as azure (\"azúr\").\n\nThe Kazakh language, like many Turkic languages, distinguishes between \"kök\" for blue and \"jasâl\" for green. In Kazakh, many adjectival variations can be found referring to perceived gradations in saturation level of \"blue\", such as \"kögildir\", \"kökshil\", and \"kökboz\", which respectively denominate the gradual decrease in the intensity, \"kökboz\" being often used as a color referent in its own right. \"Kök\" is occasionally used to denote green plants (e.g. 'kök' shöp'), but such usage is mostly confined to poetic utterances or certain localized dialects.\n\nTurkish treats dark or navy blue (\"lacivert\", from the same Persian root as English \"azure\" and \"lapis lazuli\") as a separate color from plain or light blue (\"mavi\"). \"Mavi\" is derived from the Arabic word مائي \"mā'ī\" 'like water' (ماء \"mā\"' being the Arabic word for water) and \"lacivert\" is derived from Persian لاجورد \"lājvard\" 'lapis lazuli', a semiprecious stone with the color of navy blue. In the pre-Islamic religion of the Turks, blue is the color that represented the east, as well as the zodiac sign Aquarius (the Water Bearer). A characteristic tone of blue, turquoise, was much used by the Turks for their traditional decorations and jewelry.\n\nIn traditional pre-Islamic Turkic culture, both blue and green were represented by the same name, \"gök\" 'sky'. The name is still in use in many rural areas. For instance, in many regions of Turkey, when mold is formed on cheese, the phenomenon is called \"gögermek\" 'turning into the color of \"gök\"/sky'.\n\nThe Tamil language clearly distinguishes between the colors green (\"paccai\"), blue (\"neelam\") and black (\"karuppu\"). The prefix \"karu-\" would indicate dark colors while the suffix \"iḷam\" would indicate light colors. Thus \"karumpaccai\" would be dark green.\n\nThe Telugu language uses a single word, \"pacca\", for green and yellow. To differentiate between the two shades, another word is prefixed in some cases. For example, green will be called \"ākupacca\" \"leaf-\"pacca\"\" and yellow \"pasupupacca\" \"turmeric-\"pacca\"\".\n\nThe modern Chinese language has the blue–green distinction (蓝/ 藍 \"lán\" for blue and 绿 / 綠 \"lǜ\" for green); however, another word that predates the modern vernacular, \"qīng\" (), is also used. The character depicts the budding of a young plant and it could be understood as \"verdant\", but the word is used to describe colors ranging from light and yellowish green through deep blue all the way to black, as in \"xuánqīng\" (). For example, the Flag of the Republic of China is today still referred to as \"qīng tiān, bái rì, mǎn dì hóng\" (\"'Blue' Sky, White Sun, Whole Ground Red\"—); whereas \"qīngcài\" () is the Chinese word for \"green bok choy\". A cucumber is known as either huángguā () \"yellow melon\" while () meaning \"green melon\" is more commonly used in Cantonese. \"Qīng\" 青 was the traditional designation of both blue and green for much of the history of the Chinese language, while 蓝 \"lán\" ('blue') originally referred to the indigo plant. However, the character 绿 \"lǜ\" ('green'), as a particular 'shade' of \"qīng\" applied to cloth and clothing, has been attested since the \"Book of Odes\" (1000 to 600 B.C.) (e.g., the title of Ode 27 《邶风·绿衣》 'Green Upper Garment' in the \"Airs of Bei\"). As a part of the adoption of modern Vernacular Chinese as the social norm, replacing Classical Chinese, the modern terms for blue and green are now more commonly used than \"qīng\" as standalone color terms, although \"qīng\" is still part of many common noun phrases. The two forms can also be encountered combined as 青蓝 and 青绿, with 青 being used as an intensifier.\n\nThe Japanese word , the same kanji character as the Chinese \"qīng\", can refer to either blue or green depending on the situation. Modern Japanese has a word for , but it is a relatively recent usage. Ancient Japanese did not have this distinction: the word \"midori\" only came into use in the Heian period, and at that time (and for a long time thereafter) \"midori\" was still considered a shade of \"ao\". Educational materials distinguishing green and blue only came into use after World War II; thus, even though most Japanese consider them to be green, the word \"ao\" is still used to describe certain vegetables, apples, and vegetation. \"Ao\" is also the word used to refer to the color on a traffic light that signals one to \"go\". However, most other objects—a green car, a green sweater, and so forth—will generally be called \"midori\". Japanese people also sometimes use the word , based on the English word \"green\", for colors. The language also has several other words meaning specific shades of green and blue.\n\nThe native Korean words (Revised Romanization: \"pureu-da\") or 파랗다 (parah-ta) may mean either blue or green, or bluish green. These adjectives and 파랗다 are used for blue as in (\"pureu-n haneul\") or 파란 하늘 (para-n haneul) meaning 'blue sky', or for green as in (\"pureu-n sup\", green forest) or 파란 잔디 (parah-n jandi, green grass). 파란 (paran) is also used for the traffic green light meaning 'go' as in 파란 불 (paran pul). In general, however, 파랗다 \"parah-ta\" is more associated with blue, and 푸르다 \"pureu-da\" with green. 푸른 (pur-n) and 파란 (parah-n) are noun-modifying forms, and 파랗다 \"parah-ta\" can also be used in a noun form; ( \"parang\" n.). There are Sino-Korean expressions that refer to green and blue. (\"chorok\" adj./n.), (\"choroksaek\" n. or for short, \"noksaek\" n.) is used for green. \"Cheong\" , another expression borrowed from Chinese (pinyin: \"qing\"), is mostly used for blue, as in 청바지/靑-- (cheong-baji, blue jean\" and Cheong Wa Dae ( or Hanja: ), the Blue House, which is the executive office and official residence of the President of the Republic of Korea, but is also used for green as well, as in 청과물/靑果物 (cheong-gwamul, fruits and vegetables) and 청포도/靑葡萄 (cheong-podo, green grape).\n\nIn Tibetan, སྔོན་པོ། (Wylie sngon po) is the term traditionally given for the color of the sky and of grass. This term also falls into the general pattern of naming colors by appending the suffix \"po\", as in \"mar po\" (red); \"ser po\" (yellow); \"nag po\" (black); and \"dkar po\" (white). Conspicuously, the term for \"green\" is \"ljang khu\", likely related to \"ljang bu\", and defined as—\"the grue (sngon po) sprout of wheat or barley\".\n\nVietnamese usually does not use separate words for green and refers to that color using a word that can also refer to blue. In Vietnamese, blue and green are denoted by \"xanh\" (青). This is a colloquial rendering of \"thanh\" (青), as with Chinese and Japanese. Blue is specifically described as \"xanh\", as in the skin of the sky (\"xanh da trời\") or \"\"xanh\", as in the ocean\" (\"xanh dương, xanh nước biển\") and green as \"\"xanh\", as in the leaves\" (\"xanh lá cây\").\n\nModern Vietnamese occasionally does employ the terms \"xanh lam\" and \"xanh lục\" (in which the second syllables derive from the Chinese: 藍 and 綠) for \"blue\" and \"green\", respectively.\n\nIn Mongolian, the word for green is ногоон (\"nogoon\"). Mongolian distinguishes between dark and light blue. The word for light blue is цэнхэр (\"tsenher\") and the word for dark blue is хөх (\"höh\").\n\nSpeakers of Tagalog most commonly use the Spanish loanwords for blue and green—\"asul\" (from Spanish \"azul\") and \"berde\" (from Spanish \"verde\"), respectively. Although these words are much more common in spoken use, Tagalog has native terms: \"bugháw\" for blue and \"lunti(án)\" for green, which are seen as archaic and more flowery. These are mostly confined to formal and academic writings, alongside artistic fields such literature, music, and poetry.\n\nIn Cebuano, another major Philippine language, the native words for \"blue\" and \"green\" end in the same syllable: \"pughaw\" and \"lunhaw\", respectively. Pughaw means sky blue, while lunhaw is fresh leaf green (i.e. neither brownish nor yellowish).\n\nHumour and jokes of a sexual or derogatory nature are called \"green\" in Philippine English while they would otherwise be described as \"blue\" in English (e.g. \"blue comedy\", \"blue joke\"). This is a calque of the Hispanic term \"chiste verde\".\n\nModern Javanese has distinct words for blue \"biru\" and green \"ijo\". These words are derived from Old Javanese \"birū\" and \"hijo\". However, in Old Javanese \"birū\" could mean pale blue, greyish blue, greenish blue or even turquoise, while \"hijo\" which means green, could also means the blue-green colour of clear water. \"Biru\" and \"ijo\" in Modern Javanese are cognates of Malay/Indonesian \"biru\" and \"hijau\" which have the same meaning.\n\nThe Yoruba word for green is \"àwö ewéko\", which translates to \"color of leaves\", and blue is \"àwö sánmà\", which translates to \"color of sky\".\n\nThe Swahili word for blue is \"buluu\", which is derived directly from English and has been in the language for a relatively short time. For other colors, Swahili uses either \"rangi ya ___\" (\"the color of ___\") or a shortened version, \"-a ___\". For example, green is \"rangi ya kijani\" or \"rangi ya majani\", which means \"the color of grass/leaves\". Sky blue is \"rangi ya samawati\", or \"the color of the sky\" from the Arabic word for sky. (Note: all of these can be written as \"-a kijani\", \"-a majani\", \"-a samwati\", etc.)\n\nZulu and Xhosa use the word \"-luhlaza\" (the prefix changes according to the class of the noun) for \"blue/green\".\n\nTswana uses the same word \"tala\" to refer to both blue and green. One has to deduce from the context and prior knowledge, of what is being talked about, to be able to pinpoint exactly the color in question.\n\nThe Himba people use a single word for shades of green and blue: \"buru\". They curiously have only three other colour names, and their color perception has been studied by anthropologists.\n\nThe language of the Kanien'kehá:ka Nation at Akwesasne is at Stage VII on the , and thus possesses distinct terms for a broad range of spectral and non-spectral colours, including blue (\"oruía\"), green (\"óhute\"), black (\"kahúji\"), white (\"karákA\"'), and grey (\"atakArókwa\"). According to one researcher, the Nation's term for purple (\"arihwawakunéha\"), which translates to 'bishop['s colour]', a recent coinage. The way in which purple was categorized and referenced prior to the addition of the latter term is not clear.\n\nIn the Lakota Sioux language, the word \"tȟó\" is used for both blue and green, though the word \"tȟózi\" (a mixture of the words \"tȟó\" meaning \"blue (green),\" and \"zí\" meaning \"yellow\") has become common (\"zítȟo\" can also be used). This is in line with common practice of using \"zíša/šázi\" for Orange (\"šá\" meaning \"red\"), and \"šátȟo/tȟóša\" for \"purple/violet.\"\n\nThe Choctaw language has two words, \"okchʋko\" and \"okchʋmali\", which have different meanings depending on the source. In 1852 \"okchakko\" is translated variously as pale blue or pale green, \"okchakko chohmi\" (\"somewhat okchakko\") is given as swarthy, and \"okchamali\" is defined as deep blue, gray, green, or sky blue. In 1880 \"okchakko\" and \"okchʋmali\" are both given as blue, and green is not specifically listed as a color. In an 1892 dictionary, \"okchamali\" is deep blue or green, \"okchakko\" is pale blue or bright green, and a third word \"kili̱koba\" is bright green (resembling a \"kili̱kki\", a species of parrot). By 1915, the authoritative Byington dictionary gives \"okchako\" as blue and \"okchamali\" as green, blue, gray, verdant. A current coursebook differentiates based on brightness, giving \"okchʋko\" as bright blue/green and \"okchʋmali\" as pale or dull blue/green. Modern usage in the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma language school is to use \"okchʋko\" for blue and \"okchʋmali\" for green, with no distinction for brightness.\n\nSingle words for blue/green are also found in Mayan languages; for example in the Yukatek Maya language \"blue/green\" is \"yax\".\n\nTupian languages did not originally differ between the two colors, though they may now as a result of interference of Spanish (in the case of Guaraní) or Portuguese (in the case of Nheengatu). The Tupi word \"oby\" () meant both as does the Guaraní \"hovy\" (). In modern tupi (nheengatu) you can use the word \"suikiri\" for green and \"iakira/akira\" for blue, but they are still interchangeable, because \"iakira/akira\" also means immature, as in \"pakua akira\" (green banana/immature banana), and \"suikiri\" can also mean blue. In modern guarani, they use \"hovy\" for blue and \"hovy'û\" (which literally means \"dark green/blue) for green. So \"hovy\" can still be used for green\" and \"hovy'û\" can be used for dark blue shades. They also have the word \"aky\", cognate with nheengatu \"akira\", and it means green/immature too.\n\nThe Yebamasa of the Rio Piraparana region in Vaupés Department, southeastern Colombia, use the term \"sumese\" for blue/green. The letter \"u\" is pronounced like the German \"ü\".\n\nMapudungun distinguishes between black (\"kurü\"), blue (\"kallfü\") and green (\"karü\", also meaning \"raw\" or \"immature\"). The word \"payne\" was formerly used to refer to a sky blue, and also refers to the bluish color of stones (Zúñiga, 2006).\n\n"}

It was discovered in the 2000s. It has been described by different authors as a relative of Bai or an early branching from Old Chinese. The autonym is \"\".\n\nSimilarities among Old Chinese, Waxiang, Caijia, and Bai have been pointed out by Wu & Shen (2010) and others.\nZhengzhang Shangfang (2010) argued that Bai and Caijia formed a Greater Bai subgroup of Sino-Tibetan.\nCaijia also appears to be related to the extinct Longjia and Luren languages, but they are too poorly documented for definitive classification.\n\nIn contrast, Sagart (2011) groups Caijia with Waxiang, a divergent Chinese variety spoken in northwestern Hunan, as the earliest group to split off from Old Chinese.\nSagart (2011) lists the following features of Old Chinese retained by both Caijia and Waxiang:\nSagart identifies two words as shared innovations:\n\nBijie (1983) reports the Caijia people are found in the seven counties of Bijie prefecture – Qixingguan, Dafang, Qianxi, Zhijin, Nayong, Weining, and Hezhang – comprising a total of over 3,100 households and over 18,000 individuals. Bijie (1983) reports that smaller populations of Caijia people are found in Anshun (with over 400 people) and Liupanshui (with over 3,500 people) prefectures (to the southeast and southwest respectively), as well as Zhaoyang, Yiliang, and Zhenxiong counties in Zhaotong prefecture, Yunnan (to the northwest). Bijie (1983) also contains linguistic data for the Caijia language of Hezhang County.\n\nCaijia speakers are distributed in the following locations in Bijie prefecture (Bo Wenze 2004).\n\n\nYinajia District 以那架区 has the most ethnic Caijia in Zhijin County.\n\nThe \"Liupanshui City Ethnic Gazetteer\" 六盘水市志：民族志 (2003:182-183) lists ethnic Caijia populations for the following counties in the prefecture, with a total of 4,061 (1982):\n\nIn Shuicheng County, the Caijia language is still spoken in:\n\nIn Zhenxiong County, Yunnan, the Caijia people are scattered in the village cluster of Sumu 苏木村, and in Chuanjiu 串九, Qinggang 青杠, Liangshui 凉水, Poji 泼机, Nantai 南台, Wugu 五谷 (\"Zhenxiong County Almanac\" 1986).\n\nGuizhou (1982) lists the following two dialects of the Caijia language. The Caijia dialect documented in Guizhou (1982) is that of Yangjiazhai 杨家寨, Liangyan Village 亮岩公社, Xingfa District 兴发区, Hezhang County.\n\nGuizhou (1982) notes that the -\"an\" rime in Caijia of Xingfa 兴发 corresponds to the \"-aŋ\" rime in Caijia of Longchang 龙场.\n\nHsiu (2018) reports the discovery of a previously undocumented Caijia dialect that is spoken in Niujiaojing 牛角井村, Yangjie Town 羊街镇, Weining County. This Caijia dialect is also spoken in the villages of Xinglongchang 兴隆场村, Niuchishui 牛吃水, and Fadi 发地.\n\nThe Caijia people are ethnoculturally related to the Lu (卢) people (\"Luren\" 卢人), who are classified as Manchu by the Chinese government. Luren (Lu) and Caijia are also closely related to Longjia (龙家). Caijia, Longjia, and Lu are all spoken in western Guizhou.\n\nIn Weining County, Caijia speakers are officially classified by the Chinese government as ethnic Gelao (Hsiu 2017), while in Hezhang County they are classified as Bai (Bo 2004).\n\nCaijia people with the autonym \"Menni\" (门尼 or 门你) have also been reported in Puding County, Guizhou, where they were classified as ethnic Gelao during the 1980s (Zhou Guoyan 2004).\n\nIn Zhijin County, Guizhou, Caijia people are called Silie 斯列 by the local Miao and Awuna 阿乌纳 by the local Yi (\"Zhijin County Almanac\" 1997:166).\n\nEthnic subdivisions of the Caijia people include the Black 黑, White 白, Qingshangshui 青上水, Xiashui 下水, Hanzhan 捍毡, Zhuazhua 抓抓, Datou 大头, Qianqiaoba 乾乔巴, Laohu 老虎, Luoluo 倮倮, Xuejiao 削角 (Xieguo 写果), and Jiandao 剪刀.\n\nHistorically recorded names for the Caijia include Caijiazi 蔡家子 and Gantan Caijia 擀毡蔡家.

{"id": "1357127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1357127", "title": "Children's street culture", "text": "Children's street culture\n\nChildren's street culture refers to the cumulative culture created by young children. Collectively, this body of knowledge is passed down from one generation of urban children to the next, and can also be passed between different groups of children (e.g. in the form of crazes, but also in intergenerational mixing). It is most common in children between the ages of seven and twelve. It is strongest in urban working class industrial districts where children are traditionally free to \"play out\" in the streets for long periods without supervision.\n\nChildren's street culture is invented and largely sustained by children themselves, although it may come to incorporate fragments of media culture and toys in its activities. It is not to be confused with the commercial media-culture produced \"for\" children (e.g., comics, television, mass-produced toys, and clothing), although it may overlap.\n\nYoung children's street culture usually takes place on quiet backstreets and sidewalks, and along routes that venture out into local parks, playgrounds, scrub and wasteland, and to local shops. It can often incorporate many found and scavenged materials such as old car seats, tyres, planks, bricks, etc. Sometimes found materials will be combined to create objects (e.g. making guys for Guy Fawkes Night — \"see Beck 1984\"). Play will often incorporate crazes (sometimes incorporating seasonal elements that are freely collected, such as conkers, snowballs, sycamore seeds). It also imposes imaginative status on certain sections of the urban realm (local buildings, street objects, road layouts, etc.). In summer children may use scavenged materials to create a temporary and semi-hidden \"den\" or \"hideout\" or \"HQ\" in a marginal area near their homes, that serves as an informal meeting and relaxation place during the summer (see: Sobel, 2001). An urban area that looks faceless or neglected to an adult may have deep \"spirit of place\" meanings in children's street culture.\n\nAlthough it varies from place to place, research shows that it appears to share many commonalities across many cultures. It is a traditional phenomenon that has been closely investigated and documented in the western world during the 20th century by anthropologists and folklorists such as Iona Opie; street photographers such as Roger Mayne, Helen Levitt, David Trainer, Humphrey Spender and Robert Doisneau; urbanists such as Colin Ward and Robin Moore, as well as being described in countless novels of childhood. The research of Robin Moore stresses children's need for 'marginal' unsupervised areas 'within running distance' of homes (scrubby bushes and hedges, disused buildings). There are now two academic journals devoted to this area, the \"Journal of Children's Geographies\" and \"Play & Folklore\".\n\nIt has occasionally been central to feature films, such as the \"Our Gang\" (\"Little Rascals\") series, Ealing's \"Hue and Cry\" (1947) and some Children's Film Foundation films such as \"Go Kart, Go!\" and \"Soap Box Derby\".\n\nSince the advent of distractions such as video games, and television, concerns have been expressed about the vitality - or even the survival - of children's street culture.\n\nMany informal groups of small children will develop some level of superstitious beliefs about their local area. For instance, they may believe that there are certain places that are \"unlucky\" to step on (e.g.: certain large cracks in a sidewalk) or touch (e.g.: gateposts of a certain colour) or pass beyond (such as the end of the sidewalk, beyond which is another dimension inhabited by the bogeyman), or that an old woman is a \"witch\", or that an abandoned house is \"haunted\". But in some extreme circumstances a consistent myth may emerge among young children, and across a large area. One example dates from 1997; the \"Miami New Times\" published Lynda Edwards' report \"Myths Over Miami\", which describes a huge consistent mythology spreading among young homeless children in the American South. The story has been picked up and reprinted many times on internet blogs and websites. There is no known verification or confirmation that the mythology she describes actually exists, but these \"secret stories\" are clearly based on known elements of street culture, such as labeling certain places \"haunted\" or recycling legends of dangerous spirits such as Bloody Mary. The article was the basis for Mercedes Lackey's novel \"Mad Maudlin\", co-written with Rosemary Edghill.\n\n\nThe 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" entry for \"Children's games\" recommends: \"the following works: A. B. Gomme's \"Traditional Games of Great Britain\" (2 vols., Nutt, 1894-1898); Gomme's \"Children's Singing Games\" (Nutt, 1904); ... Newell's \"Games of American Children\" (Harper Bros., New York, 1884).\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3602330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3602330", "title": "Cinema of Asia", "text": "Cinema of Asia\n\nAsian cinema refers to the film industries and films produced in the continent of Asia, and is also sometimes known as Eastern cinema. More commonly, however, it is most often used to refer to the cinema of Eastern, Southeastern and Southern Asia. West Asian cinema is sometimes classified as part of Middle Eastern cinema, along with the cinema of Egypt. The cinema of Central Asia is often grouped with the Middle East or, in the past, the cinema of the Soviet Union during the Soviet Central Asia era. North Asia is dominated by Siberian Russian cinema, and is thus considered part of European cinema.\n\nEast Asian cinema is typified by the cinema of Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea, including the Japanese anime industry and action films of Hong Kong. South Asian cinema is typified by the cinema of India (including Bollywood, South Indian, Bengali and Punjabi cinema), the cinema of Pakistan (including Punjabi and Urdu cinema), the cinema of Bangladesh (Bengali cinema), and the cinema of Nepal. Southeast Asian cinema is typified by the cinema of the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, and other Southeast Asian countries. The cinema of Central Asia and the southern Caucasus is typified by Iranian cinema and the cinema of Tajikistan. West Asian cinema is typified by Arab cinema, Iranian cinema, Israeli cinema, Jewish cinema, and Turkish cinema.\n\nA 5,200-year-old earthen bowl found in Shahr-i Sokhta, Iran, has five images of a goat painted along the sides. This is believed to be an example of early animation.\n\nMo-Ti, a Chinese philosopher \"circa\" 500 BC, pondered the phenomenon of inverted light from the outside world beaming through a small hole in the opposite wall in a darkened room. Shadow plays first appeared during the Han Dynasty and later gain popularity across Asia. Around 180 AD, Ting Huan (丁緩) created an elementary zoetrope in China.\n\nIn 1021, Alhazen, an Iraqi scientist, experimented with the same optical principle described by Mo-Ti, and wrote of the results in his \"Book of Optics\", which provided the first clear description and correct analysis of the \"camera obscura\". His lamp experiment, where several different light sources are arranged across a large area, was the first to successfully project an entire image from outdoors onto a screen indoors with the \"camera obscura\".\n\nThe first short films from Asia were produced during the 1890s. The first short films produced in Japan were \"Bake Jizo\" (\"Jizo the Spook\") and \"Shinin no Sosei\" (\"Resurrection of a Corpse\"), both from 1898. The first Indian short film was also produced in 1898, \"The Flower of Persia\", directed by Hiralal Sen.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Israeli silent movies were screened in sheds, cafes and other temporary structures. In 1905, Cafe Lorenz opened on Jaffa Road in the Jewish neighborhood of Neve Tzedek. From 1909, the Lorenz family began screening movies at the cafe. In 1925, the Kessem Cinema was housed there for a short time. The first East Asian feature film was Japan's \"The Life Story of Tasuke Shiobara\" (1912). It was followed by India's first feature-length silent film, the period piece drama \"Raja Harishchandra\" (1913), by Dadasaheb Phalke, considered the father of Indian cinema. By the next decade, the output of Indian cinema was an average of 27 films per year. On the other hand, in the Philippines, the first film produced and made in the Philippines was La Vida de Jose Rizal in 1912 by Edward Meyer Gross. José Nepomuceno, bought his first film equipment from Albert Yearsley and Edward Meyer Gross on May 15, 1917 and for the next two years, Nepomuceno practiced using the equipment in preparation for making the first locally produced feature film of the Philippines. The first locally produced film in the Philippines is Dalagang Bukid. The film was released with English, Spanish, and Tagalog subtitles. During its theatrical run, leading actress Atang de la Rama had to sing \"Nabasag ang Banga\" (a song which is a part of the film) for every screening of the film in Manila, along with three others playing a violin, a cornet, and a piano\n\nIn the 1920s, the newborn Soviet cinema was the most radically innovative. There, the craft of editing, especially, surged forward, going beyond its previous role in advancing a story. Sergei Eisenstein perfected the technique of so-called dialectical or intellectual montage, which strove to make non-linear, often violently clashing, images express ideas and provoke emotional and intellectual reactions in the viewer.\n\nJewish cinema, particularly the Yiddish theater of Ashkenazi Jews, made its mark from the 1930s onward. Over 100 films were made in Yiddish, although many are now lost. Prominent films included \"Shulamith\" (1931), the first Yiddish musical on film \"His Wife's Lover\" (1931), \"A Daughter of Her People\" (1932), the anti-Nazi film \"The Wandering Jew\" (1933), \"The Yiddish King Lear\" (1934), \"Shir Hashirim\" (1935), the biggest Yiddish film hit of all time \"Yidl Mitn Fidl\" (1936), \"Where Is My Child?\" (1937), \"Green Fields\" (1937), \"Dybuk\" (1937), \"The Singing Blacksmith\" (1938), \"Tevya\" (1939), \"Mirele Efros\" (1939), \"Lang ist der Weg\" (1948), and \"God, Man and Devil\" (1950). Additionally, the films of the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, and Woody Allen have left a lasting mark on cinema.\n\nSound films began being produced in Asia from the 1930s. Notable early talkies from the cinema of Japan included Kenji Mizoguchi's \"Sisters of the Gion\" (\"Gion no shimai\", 1936), \"Osaka Elegy\" (1936) and \"The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums\" (1939), along with Sadao Yamanaka's \"Humanity and Paper Balloons\" (1937) and Mikio Naruse's \"Wife, Be Like A Rose!\" (\"Tsuma Yo Bara No Yoni\", 1935), which was one of the first Japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the U.S. However, with increasing censorship, the left-leaning tendency films of directors such as Daisuke Ito also began to come under attack. A few Japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s, but Japan's first feature-length talkie was \"Fujiwara Yoshie no furusato\" (1930), which used the 'Mina Talkie System'. In 1935, Yasujirō Ozu also directed \"An Inn in Tokyo\", considered a precursor to the neorealism genre.\n\nArdeshir Irani released \"Alam Ara\", the first Indian talking film, on March 14, 1931. Following the inception of 'talkies' in India some film stars were highly sought after and earned comfortable incomes through acting. As sound technology advanced the 1930s saw the rise of music in Indian cinema with musicals such as \"Indra Sabha\" and \"Devi Devyani\" marking the beginning of song-and-dance in India's films. Studios emerged across major cities such as Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai as filmmaking became an established craft by 1935, exemplified by the success of \"Devdas\", which had managed to enthrall audiences nationwide.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II by the mid-1940s, the period from the late 1940s to the 1960s is considered the 'Golden Age' of Asian cinema. Many of the most critically acclaimed Asian films of all time were produced during this period, including Yasujirō Ozu's \"Late Spring\" (1949) and \"Tokyo Story\" (1953); Akira Kurosawa's \"Rashomon\" (1950), \"Ikiru\" (1952), \"Seven Samurai\" (1954) and \"Throne of Blood\" (1957); Kenji Mizoguchi's \"The Life of Oharu\" (1952), \"Sansho the Bailiff\" (1954) and \"Ugetsu\" (1954); Satyajit Ray's \"The Apu Trilogy\" (1955–1959), \"The Music Room\" (1958) and \"Charulata\" (1964); Guru Dutt's \"Pyaasa\" (1957) and \"Kaagaz Ke Phool\" (1959); and Fei Mu's \"Spring in a Small Town\" (1948), Raj Kapoor's \"Awaara\" (1951), Mikio Naruse's \"Floating Clouds\" (1955), Mehboob Khan's \"Mother India\" (1957), and Ritwik Ghatak's \"Subarnarekha\" (1962).\n\nDuring Japanese cinema's 'Golden Age' of the 1950s and 1960s, successful films included \"Rashomon\" (1950), \"Seven Samurai\" (1954) and \"The Hidden Fortress\" (1958) by Akira Kurosawa, as well as Yasujirō Ozu's \"Tokyo Story\" (1953) and Ishirō Honda's \"Godzilla\" (1954). These films have had a profound influence on world cinema. In particular, Kurosawa's \"Seven Samurai\" has been remade several times as Western films, such as \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960) and \"Battle Beyond the Stars\" (1980), and has also inspired several Bollywood films, such as \"Sholay\" (1975) and \"China Gate\" (1998). \"Rashomon\" was also remade as \"The Outrage\" (1964), and inspired films with \"Rashomon effect\" storytelling methods, such as \"Andha Naal\" (1954), \"The Usual Suspects\" (1995) and \"Hero\" (2002). \"The Hidden Fortress\" was also the inspiration behind George Lucas' \"Star Wars\" (1977). The Japanese New Wave began in the late 1950s and continued into the 1960s. Other famous Japanese filmmakers from this period include Kenji Mizoguchi, Mikio Naruse, Hiroshi Inagaki and Nagisa Oshima. Japanese cinema later became one of the main inspirations behind the New Hollywood movement of the 1960s to 1980s.\n\nDuring Indian cinema's 'Golden Age' of the 1950s and 1960s, it was producing 200 films annually, while Indian independent films gained greater recognition through international film festivals. One of the most famous was \"The Apu Trilogy\" (1955–1959) from critically acclaimed Bengali film director Satyajit Ray, whose films had a profound influence on world cinema, with directors such as Akira Kurosawa, Martin Scorsese, James Ivory, Abbas Kiarostami, Elia Kazan, François Truffaut, Steven Spielberg, Carlos Saura, Jean-Luc Godard, Isao Takahata, Gregory Nava, Ira Sachs, Wes Anderson and Danny Boyle being influenced by his cinematic style. According to Michael Sragow of \"The Atlantic Monthly\", the \"youthful coming-of-age dramas that have flooded art houses since the mid-fifties owe a tremendous debt to the Apu trilogy\". Subrata Mitra's cinematographic technique of bounce lighting also originates from \"The Apu Trilogy\". Satyajit Ray's success led to the establishment of the 'Parallel Cinema' movement, which was at its peak during the 1950s and 1960s. Other famous Indian filmmakers from this period include Guru Dutt, Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, Bimal Roy, K. Asif and Mehboob Khan.\n\nThe cinema of China experienced a 'Golden Age' in the late 1940s. In 1946, Cai Chusheng returned to Shanghai to revive the Lianhua name as the \"Lianhua Film Society.\" This in turn became Kunlun Studios which would go on to become one of the most important Chinese studios of the era, putting out the classics, \"Myriads of Lights\" (1948), \"The Spring River Flows East\" (1947), and \"Crows and Sparrows\" (1949). Wenhua's romantic drama \"Spring in a Small Town\" (1948), a film by director Fei Mu shortly prior to the revolution, is often regarded by Chinese film critics as one of the most important films in the history of Chinese cinema, with it being named by the Hong Kong Film Awards in 2004 as the greatest Chinese-language film ever made.\n\nThe cinema of Malaysia also had its 'Golden Age' in the post-war period of the 1950s and 1960s. The period saw the introduction of the studio system of filmmaking in Malaysia and influx of influences from Hollywood, the emerging cinema of Hong Kong, and particularly the Indian and Japanese film industries which were themselves experiencing a Golden Age.\n\nThe cinema of South Korea also experienced a 'Golden Age' in the late 1950s and 1960s, beginning with director Lee Kyu-hwan's tremendously successful remake of \"Chunhyang-jon\" (1955). That year also saw the release of \"Yangsan Province\" by the renowned director, Kim Ki-young, marking the beginning of his productive career. Both the quality and quantity of filmmaking had increased rapidly by the end of the 1950s. South Korean films, such as Lee Byeong-il's 1956 comedy \"Sijibganeun nal (The Wedding Day)\", had begun winning international awards. In contrast to the beginning of the 1950s, when only 5 movies were made per year, 111 films were produced in South Korea in 1959. The year 1960 saw the production of Kim Ki-young's \"The Housemaid\" and Yu Hyun-mok's \"Aimless Bullet\", both of which have been listed among the best Korean films ever made.\n\nThe late 1950s and 1960s was also a 'Golden Age' for Philippine cinema, with the emergence of more artistic and mature films, and significant improvement in cinematic techniques among filmmakers. The studio system produced frenetic activity in the local film industry as many films were made annually and several local talents started to earn recognition abroad. One such honor was bestowed to Manuel Conde's immortal movie \"Gengis Khan\" (1950) when it was accepted for screening at the 13th Venice Film Festival. Other awards include Gerardo de Leon's \"Ifugao\" (1954) and Lamberto Avellana's \"Anak Dalita\". By the end of the decade Philippine cinema had developed into a major force in the Asian region. The premiere Philippine directors of the era included Gerardo de Leon, Gregorio Fernandez, Eddie Romero, Lamberto Avellana, and Cirio Santiago.\n\nThe 1960s is often cited as being the 'golden age' of Pakistani cinema. Many A-stars were introduced in this period in time and became legends on the silver screen. As black-and-white became obsolete, Pakistan saw the introduction of its first colour films, the first being Munshi Dil's \"Azra\" in early 1960s, Zahir Rehan's \"Sangam\" (first full-length coloured film) in 1964, and \"Mala\" (first coloured cinemascope film). In 1961, the political film \"Bombay Wallah\" was released, based on the city of Bombay in neighbouring India, in the wake of the growing tension between the nations. In 1962, \"Shaheed\" (\"Martyr\") pronounced the Palestine issue on the silver screen and became an instant hit, leading to a changing tide in the attitude of filmmakers.\n\nThe 1960s was the \"golden age\" of Cambodian cinema. Several production companies were started and more movie theaters were built throughout the country. More than 300 movies were made in Cambodia during the era. A number of Khmer language films were well received in its neougbouring countries at the time. Among the classic films from Cambodia during this period were \"Lea Haey Duong Dara\" (\"Goodbye Duong Dara\") and \"Pos Keng Kang\" (\"The Snake King's Wife\") by Tea Lim Kun and Sabbseth, and \"An Euil Srey An\" (\"Khmer After Angkor\") by Ly Bun Yim.\n\nThe range of Jewish entrepreneurs in the American film industry is considerable: Samuel Goldwyn, Louis B. Mayer, the Warner Brothers, David O. Selznick, Marcus Loew, and Adolph Zukor, Fox, and so forth. A more specifically Jewish sensibility can be seen in the films of the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, or Woody Allen; other examples of specifically Jewish films from the Hollywood film industry are the Barbra Streisand vehicle Yentl (1983), or John Frankenheimer's The Fixer (1968). In 1966, 2.6 million Israelis went to the cinema over 50 million times. From 1968, when television broadcasting began, theaters began to close down, first in the periphery, then in major cities. 330 standalone theaters were torn down or redesigned as multiplex theaters.\n\nBy the late '60s and early '70s, Japanese cinema had begun to become seriously affected by the collapse of the studio system. As Japanese cinema slipped into a period of relative low visibility, the cinema of Hong Kong entered a dramatic renaissance of its own, largely a side effect of the development of the \"wuxia\" blending of action, history, and spiritual concerns. Several major figures emerged in Hong Kong at this time - perhaps most famously, King Hu, whose 1966 \"Come Drink With Me\" was a key influence upon many subsequent Hong Kong cinematic developments. Shortly thereafter, the American-born Bruce Lee became a global icon in the 1970s.\n\nFrom 1969 onwards, the Iranian New Wave led to the growth of Iranian cinema, which would later go on to achieve international acclaim in the 1980s and 1990s. The most notable figures of the Iranian New Wave are Abbas Kiarostami, Jafar Panahi, Majid Majidi, Bahram Beizai, Darius Mehrjui, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Masoud Kimiay, Sohrab Shahid-Saless, Parviz Kimiavi, Samira Makhmalbaf, Amir Naderi, and Abolfazl Jalili. Features of New Wave Iranian film, in particular the works of Kiarostami, have been classified by some as postmodern.\n\nThe 1970s also saw the establishment of Bangladeshi cinema following the country's independence in 1971. One of the first films produced in Bangladesh after independence was \"Titash Ekti Nadir Naam\" (\"A River Called Titas\") in 1973 by acclaimed director Ritwik Ghatak, whose stature in Bengali cinema is comparable to that of Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen. Another great film of Bangladesh is Mita's 'Lathial' (The striker), were the best movies of the year of 1975. 'Lathial' got first National Award as the best film, and mita got first National Award as best director.\n\nIn the cinema of India, the 1970s saw a decline in 'Parallel Cinema' and the rise of commercial Hindi cinema in the form of enduring \"masala\" films, such as the Mumbai underworld film \"Deewaar\" (1975) and \"Curry Western\" movie \"Sholay\" (1975), which solidified Amitabh Bachchan's position as a lead actor. Commercial cinema further grew throughout the 1980s and the 1990s with the release of films such as \"Mr. India\" (1987), \"Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak\" (1988), \"Tezaab\" (1988), \"Chandni\" (1989), \"Maine Pyar Kiya\" (1989), \"Baazigar\" (1993), \"Darr\" (1993), \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" (1994) and \"Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge\" (1995).\n\nDuring the 1980s, Japanese cinema - aided by the rise of independent filmmaking and the spectacular success of anime - began to make something of an international comeback. Simultaneously, a new post-Mao Zedong generation of Chinese filmmakers began to gain global attention. Another group of filmmakers, centered around Edward Yang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, launched what has become known as the \"Taiwanese New Wave\".\n\nThe 1980s is also considered the Golden Age of Hong Kong action cinema. Jackie Chan reinvented the martial arts film genre with a new emphasis on elaborate and dangerous stunts and slapstick humour, beginning with \"Project A\" (1983). John Woo began the \"heroic bloodshed\" genre based on triads, beginning with \"A Better Tomorrow\" (1986). The Hong Kong New Wave also occurred during this period, led by filmmakers such as Tsui Hark.\n\nWith the post-1980 rise in popularity of East Asian cinema in the West, Western audiences are again becoming familiar with many of the industry's filmmakers and stars. A number of these key players, such as Chow Yun-fat and Zhang Ziyi, have \"crossed over\", working in Western films. Others have gained exposure through the international success of their films, though many more retain more of a \"cult\" appeal, finding a degree of Western success through DVD sales rather than cinema releases.\n\nIn the modern era, the success of Israeli and diaspora Jewish cinema can be observed in industry giants ranging from Michael Ovitz, Michael Eisner, Lew Wasserman, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg, and David Geffen. However, few of these ever focused on Jewish issues with the sometime exception of Spielberg. In the first decade of the 21st century, several Israeli films won awards in film festivals around the world. Prominent films of this period include \"Late Marriage\" (Dover Koshashvili), \"Broken Wings\", \"Walk on Water\" and \"Yossi & Jagger\" (Eytan Fox), \"Nina's Tragedies\", \"Campfire\" and \"Beaufort\" (Joseph Cedar), \"Or (My Treasure)\" (Keren Yedaya), \"Turn Left at the End of the World\" (Avi Nesher), \"The Band's Visit\" (Eran Kolirin) \"Waltz With Bashir\" (Ari Folman), and \"Ajami\". In 2011, Strangers No More won the Oscar for best Short Documentary.\n\n\n"}

The story took place five years after the events of the 1981 film, as Calibos escaped the underworld to take revenge against Perseus. In 2009, a one-shot sequel titled \"Wrath of the Titans: Cyclops\" was released. In 2011, \"Revenge of the Medusa\", was released as a four-part series.

{"id": "674483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=674483", "title": "Creative industries", "text": "Creative industries\n\nThe creative industries refers to a range of economic activities which are concerned with the generation or exploitation of knowledge and information. They may variously also be referred to as the cultural industries (especially in Europe or the creative economy , and most recently they have been denominated as the Orange Economy in Latin America and the Caribbean (Buitrago & Duque 2013).\n\nHowkins' creative economy comprises advertising, architecture, art, crafts, design, fashion, film, music, performing arts, publishing, R&D, software, toys and games, TV and radio, and video games . Some scholars consider that education industry, including public and private services, is forming a part of creative industry. There remain, therefore, different definitions of the sector .\n\nThe creative industries have been seen to become increasingly important to economic well-being, proponents suggesting that \"human creativity is the ultimate economic resource\" , and that \"the industries of the twenty-first century will depend increasingly on the generation of knowledge through creativity and innovation\" .\n\nVarious commentators have provided varying suggestions on what activities to include in the concept of \"creative industries\" , and the name itself has become a contested issue – with significant differences and overlap between the terms \"creative industries\", \"cultural industries\" and \"creative economy\" .\n\nLash and Urry suggest that each of the creative industries has an \"irreducible core\" concerned with \"the exchange of finance for rights in intellectual property\", . This echoes the UK Government Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) definition which describes the creative industries as:\n\n\nTo this list John Howkins would add toys and games, also including the much broader area of research and development in science and technology . It has also been argued that gastronomy belongs in such a list.\n\nThe various fields of engineering do not appear on this list, that emerged from the DCMS reports. This was due, probably, to the fact that engineers occupy relevant positions in \"non-cultural\" corporations, performing activities of project, management, operation, maintenance, risk analysis and supervision, among others. However, historically and presently, several tasks of engineers can be regarded as highly creative, inventive and innovative. The contribution of engineering is represented by new products, processes and services.\n\nHesmondhalgh reduces the list to what he terms \"the core cultural industries\" of advertising and marketing, broadcasting, film, internet and music industries, print and electronic publishing, and video and computer games. His definition only includes those industries that create \"texts\"' or \"cultural artefacts\" and which engage in some form of industrial reproduction .\n\nThe DCMS list has proven influential, and many other nations have formally adopted it. It has also been criticised. It has been argued that the division into sectors obscures a divide between lifestyle business, non-profits, and larger businesses, and between those who receive state subsidies (e.g., film) and those who do not (e.g., computer games). The inclusion of the antiques trade often comes into question, since it does not generally involve production (except of reproductions and fakes). The inclusion of all computer services has also been questioned .\n\nSome areas, such as Hong Kong, have preferred to shape their policy around a tighter focus on copyright ownership in the value chain. They adopt the WIPO's classifications, which divide up the creative industries according to who owns the copyrights at various stages during the production and distribution of creative content.\n\nThe Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has denominated them for Latin America and the Caribbean as the Orange Economy which is defined as the \"group of linked activities through which ideas are transformed into cultural goods and services whose value is determined by intellectual property.\"\n\nOthers have suggested a distinction between those industries that are open to mass production and distribution (film and video; videogames; broadcasting; publishing), and those that are primarily craft-based and are meant to be consumed in a particular place and moment (visual arts; performing arts; cultural heritage).\n\nThe DCMS classifies enterprises and occupations as creative according to what the enterprise primarily produces, and what the worker primarily does. Thus, a company which produces records would be classified as belonging to the music industrial sector, and a worker who plays piano would be classified as a musician.\n\nThe primary purpose of this is to quantify – for example it can be used to count the number of firms, and the number of workers, creatively employed in any given location, and hence to identify places with particularly high concentrations of creative activities.\n\nIt leads to some complications which are not immediately obvious. For example, a security guard working for a music company would be classified as a creative employee, although not as creatively occupied.\n\nThe total number of creative employees is then calculated as the sum of:\n\n\nAccording to Caves (2000), creative industries are characterized by seven economic properties:\n\n\nThe properties described by Caves have been criticized for being too rigid (Towse, 2000). Not all creative workers are purely driven by 'art for art's sake'. The 'ars longa' property also holds for certain noncreative products (i.e., licensed products). The 'time flies' property also holds for large construction projects. Creative industries are therefore not unique, but they score generally higher on these properties relative to non-creative industries.\n\nThere is often a question about the boundaries between creative industries and the similar term of cultural industries. Cultural industries are best described as an adjunct-sector of the creative industries. Cultural industries include industries that focus on cultural tourism and heritage, museums and libraries, sports and outdoor activities, and a variety of 'way of life' activities that arguably range from local pet shows to a host of hobbyist concerns. Thus cultural industries are more concerned about delivering other kinds of value—including cultural wealth and social wealth—rather than primarily providing monetary value. (See also cultural institutions studies.)\n\nSome authors, such as the American economist Richard Florida, argue for a wider focus on the products of knowledge workers, and judge the 'creative class' (his own term) to include nearly all those offering professional knowledge-based services.\n\nFlorida's focus leads him to pay particular attention to the nature of the creative workforce. In a study of why particular US cities such as San Francisco seem to attract creative producers, Florida argues that a high proportion of workers from the 'creative class' provide a key input to creative production, which enterprises seek out. He seeks to quantitatively establish the importance of diversity and multiculturalism in the cities concerned, for example the existence of a significant public gay community, ethnic and religious variety, and tolerance. \n\nGlobally, Creative Industries excluding software and general scientific research and development are said to have accounted for around 4% of the world's economic output in 1999, which is the last year for which comprehensive figures are currently available. Estimates of the output corresponding to scientific Research and Development suggest that an additional 4-9% might be attributable to the sector if its definition is extended to include such activities, though the figures vary significantly between different countries.\n\nTaking the UK as an example, in the context of other sectors, the creative industries make a far more significant contribution to output than hospitality or utilities and deliver four times the output due to agriculture, fisheries and forestry. In terms of employment and depending on the definition of activities included, the sector is a major employer of between 4-6% of the UK's working population, though this is still significantly less than employment due to traditional areas of work such as retail and manufacturing.\n\nWithin the creative industries sector and again taking the UK as an example, the three largest sub-sectors are design, publishing, and television and radio. Together these account for around 75% of revenues and 50% of employment.\n\nThe complex supply chains in the creative industries sometimes make it challenging to calculate accurate figures for the gross value added by each sub-sector. This is particularly the case for the service-focused sub-sectors such as advertising, whereas it is more straightforward in product-focused sub-sectors such as crafts. Not surprisingly, perhaps, competition in product-focused areas tends to be more intense with a tendency to drive the production end of the supply chain to become a commodity business.\n\nThere may be a tendency for publicly funded creative industries development services to inaccurately estimate the number of creative businesses during the mapping process. There is also imprecision in nearly all tax code systems that determine a person's profession, since many creative people operate simultaneously in multiple roles and jobs. Both these factors mean that official statistics relating to the Creative Industries should be treated with caution.\n\nThe creative industries in Europe make a significant contribution to the EU economy, creating about 3% of EU GDP – corresponding to an annual market value of €500 billion – and employing about 6 million people. In addition, the sector plays a crucial role in fostering innovation, in particular for devices and networks. The EU records the second highest TV viewing figures globally, producing more films than any other region in the world. In that respect, the newly proposed 'Creative Europe' programme (July 2011) will help preserve cultural heritage while increasing the circulation of creative works inside and outside the EU. The programme will play a consequential role in stimulating cross border co-operation, promoting peer learning and making these sectors more professional. The Commission will then propose a financial instrument run by the European Investment Bank to provide debt and equity finance for cultural and creative industries. The role of the non-state actors within the governance regarding Medias will not be neglected anymore. Therefore, building a new approach extolling the crucial importance of a European level playing field industry may boost the adoption of policies aimed at developing a conducive environment, enabling European companies as well as citizens to use their imagination and creativity – both sources of innovation -, and therefore of competitiveness and sustainability. It supposes to tailor the regulatory and institutional frameworks in supporting private-public collaboration, in particular in the Medias sector. The EU therefore plans to develop clusters, financing instruments as well as foresight activities to support this sector. The European Commission wishes to assist European creators and audiovisual enterprises to develop new markets through the use of digital technology, and asks how policy-making can best help achieve this. A more entrepreneurial culture will have to take hold with a more positive attitude towards risk-taking, and a capacity to innovate anticipating future trends. Creativity plays an important role in human resource management as artists and creative professionals can think laterally. Moreover, new jobs requiring new skills created in the post-crisis economy should be supported by labour mobility to ensure that people are employed wherever their skills are needed.\n\nIn the introduction to a 2013 special issue of \"Work and Occupations\" on artists in the US workforce, the guest editors argue that by examining the work lives of artists, one can identify characteristics and actions that help both individual workers and policy makers adapt to changing economic conditions. Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper cite multiple sources to suggest artists' skill sets allow them to \"work beyond existing markets and create entirely new opportunities for themselves and others\". Specifically, Lingo and Tepper suggest artistic workers are \"catalysts of change and innovation\" because they \"face special challenges managing ambiguity, developing and sustaining a relative identity, and forming community in the context of an individually based enterprise economy\" (2013). Because of these adaptive skills, the suggestion is that \"studying how artists cope with uncertainty and the factors that influence their success should be relevant for understanding these broader social and economic trends facing today's (and tomorrow's) workforce.\"\n\nThis view of artist-as-change-agent changes the questions researchers ask of creative economies. Old research questions would focus on topics like \"skills, work practices, contracts, wage differentials, employment incentives, formal credentials, employment pipelines, and labor flows of differentiated occupational categories\". Examples of new questions include:\n\nAs some first world countries struggle to compete in traditional markets such as manufacturing, many now see the creative industry as a key component in a new knowledge economy, capable perhaps of delivering urban regeneration, often through initiatives linked to exploitation of cultural heritage that leads to increased tourism. It is often argued that, in future, the ideas and imagination of countries like the United Kingdom will be their greatest asset; in support of this argument, a number of universities in the UK have started to offer creative entrepreneurship as a specific area for study and research. Indeed, UK government figures reveal that the UK's creative industries account for over a million jobs and brought in £112.5 billion to the UK economy (DCMS \"Creative Industries Mapping Document\" 2001), although the data sets underlying these figures are open to question.\n\nIn recent years, creative industries have become 'increasingly attractive to governments outside the developed world'. In 2005, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) XI High Level Panel on Creative Industries and Development commissioned several studies to identify challenges and opportunities facing the growth and development of creative industries in developing industries. As Cunningham \"et al.\" (2009) put it, 'the harnessing of creativity brings with it the potential of new wealth creation, the cultivation of local talent and the generation of creative capital, the development of new export markets, significant multiplier effects throughout the broader economy, the utilisation of information communication technologies and enhanced competitiveness in an increasingly global economy'. A key driver of interest in creative industries and development is the acknowledgement that the value of creative production resides in ideas and individual creativity, and developing countries have rich cultural traditions and pools of creative talent which lay a basic foundation for creative enterprises. Reflecting the growing interest in the potential of creative industries in developing countries, in October 2011 a Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy was created within the Indonesian government with well-known economist Dr Mari Pangestu appointed as the first minister to hold the position.\n\n\n"}

Cultural rather than geographical in division, the boundaries of East and West are not fixed, but vary according to the criteria adopted by individuals using the term. Historically, Asia (excluding Siberia) was regarded as the East, and Europe was regarded as the West. Today, the \"West\" usually refers to Australasia, Europe, and America. Used in discussing such studies as management, economics, international relations, and linguistics, the concept is criticized for overlooking regional hybridity.\n\nConceptually, the boundaries are cultural, rather than geographical, as a result of which Australia is typically grouped in the \nWest (despite being geographically in the east), while Islamic nations are, regardless of location, grouped in the East. However, there are a few Muslim-majority regions in Europe which do not fit this dichotomy. The culture line can be particularly difficult to place in regions of cultural diversity such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose citizens may themselves identify as East or West depending on ethnic or religious background. Further, residents of different parts of the world perceive the boundaries differently; for example, some European scholars define Russia as East, but most agree that it is the West's second complementary part, and Islamic nations regard it and other predominantly Christian nations as the West. Another unanswered question is whether Siberia (North Asia) is \"Eastern\" or \"Western.\"\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, there were many different types of civilizations that were comparable in some ways, but contrast each other in other ways. The Eastern civilizations and empires of the West are not comparable because of social class system, the way of making money and leadership. Special jobs for the people caused the rift between the East and West to grow, it was the difference between feudalism and the Eastern social system, the difference between trade and agriculture and the difference between the stability of government. The West and the Eastern Civilizations are not only different because of where they are, but also because of their social class system, the way of making money and leadership. \n\nThe daily life of the common people in the West and the Eastern Civilizations differed greatly based on how their society was run, and what it was focused on. One of the major differences between the West and the Eastern Civilizations was feudalism and manorialism. They both shaped the social hierarchy and the overall life of the common person in the East. The manorial system was set up with a lord at the top who owned a large amount of land. He had serfs and peasants that he employed, the peasants in exchange for the land they got, for working, paid a rent of crop to the lord. This feudal society was every man for himself and did not help in the expansion of a civilization. \n\nThe social system of the West and East were different. Mongolia rose from nomadic tribes united by Genghis Khan. He conquered much of the surrounding land and created a large empire. They would give the defenders a choice to either join them or die. This brutal mentality was shown when they conquered the vast majority of Asia and some of Europe and the Middle East. One thing that set the Tang dynasty of China apart was their increased social mobility. They had a series of tests that could be taken to better social status. Instead of the high-ranking positions being exclusively for the aristocrats, they were easier for the poor to gain access to. In the West, it was harder to move up or down in the social classes, but in Eastern Civilizations, mobility was possible. In China, it was possible to move up in social status through tests and, in Mongolia it was possible to gain rank in the army through military skill because the society was based on its military prowess.\n\nThe West and the Eastern civilizations differed politically because the common people of the East were not always content with their leadership. While the West had many rulers in a short period of time, there was no unrest with the people. Eastern civilizations had rebellions and long gaps between rulers that caused unrest. In England, there was a major war for the throne that lasted for almost a century. During a major war in the 14th and 15th century, England had many struggles for the throne that lead to much bloodshed. France also had problems in their government. Throughout all of this, England was still able to fight the French and almost win in the Hundred Years War. In Eastern civilizations the government was not always stable. In China, one of the deadliest events in human history occurred during the Tang dynasty. The An Lushan Rebellion was very bloody and shows the instability in the Chinese government.\n\nEconomically, the West and the Eastern civilizations were drastically different because of how they acquired money. In China, one of the major economic factors was the trade. They were connected to Europe with the Silk Road, this was a series of trade routes from East Asia to Europe. The Silk Road was not only used to trade goods, it was also a place for trading ways of thought or religion. The English employed a special type of feudalism called bastard feudalism. This type of feudalism, prominent in the War of the Roses, was different from regular feudalism because it introduces money into the social hierarchy. Nobles could now pay their knights for their service in money instead of giving them land. This strengthened the feudal system because if there was a weak ruler, the strong government of the new nobles would support the people. The British nobles also created the Magna carta to reduce the kings power. This monetization of the class system changed how England was ruled and made it very different from the Eastern Civilizations.\n\nThe concept has been used in both \"Eastern\" and \"Western\" nations. Japanese sinologist Tachibana Shiraki, in the 1920s, wrote of the need to unify Asia—East Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia but excluding Central Asia and the Middle East—and form a \"New East\" that might combine culturally in balancing against the West. Japan continued to make much of the concept, known as Pan-Asianism, throughout World War II, in propaganda. In China, it was encapsulated during the Cold War in a 1957 speech by Mao Zedong, who launched a slogan when he said, \"This is a war between two worlds. The West Wind cannot prevail over the East Wind; the East Wind is bound to prevail over the West Wind.\"\n\nTo Western writers, in the 1940s, it became bound up with an idea of aggressive, \"frustrated nationalism\", which was seen as \"intrinsically anti- or non-Western\"; sociologist Frank Furedi wrote, \"The already existing intellectual assessment of European nationalism adapted to the growth of the Third World variety by developing the couplet of mature Western versus immature Eastern nationalism... This East-West dichotomy became an accepted part of Western political theory.\" \n\nThe 1978 book \"Orientalism\", by Edward Said, was highly influential in further establishing concepts of the East–West dichotomy in the Western world, bringing into college lectures a notion of the East as \"characterized by religious sensibilities, familial social orders, and ageless traditions\" in contrast to Western \"rationality, material and technical dynamism, and individualism.\"\n\nMore recently, the divide has also been posited as an Islamic \"East\" and an American and European \"West.\" Critics note that an Islamic/non-Islamic East–West dichotomy is complicated by the global dissemination of Islamic fundamentalism and by cultural diversity within Islamic nations, moving the argument \"beyond that of an East-West dichotomy and into a tripartite situation.\"\n\nThe East–West dichotomy has been used in studying a range of topics, including management, economics and linguistics. \"Knowledge Creation and Management\" (2007) examines it as the difference in organizational learning between Western cultures and the Eastern world. It has been widely used in exploring the period of rapid economic growth that has been termed the \"East-Asian miracle\" in segments of East Asia, particularly the Asian Tigers, following World War II. Some sociologists, in line with the West as a model of modernity posited by Arnold J. Toynbee, have perceived the economic expansion as a sign of the \"Westernization\" of the region, but others look for explanation in cultural/racial characteristics of the East, embracing concepts of fixed Eastern cultural identity in a phenomenon described as \"New Orientalism\". Both approaches to the East-West dichotomy have been criticized for failing to take into account the historical hybridity of the regions.\n\nThe concept has also been brought to bear on examinations of intercultural communication. Asians are widely described as embracing an \"inductive speech pattern\" in which a primary point is approached indirectly, but Western societies are said to use \"deductive speech\" in which speakers immediately establish their point. That is attributed to a higher priority among Asians in harmonious interrelations, but Westerners are said to prioritize direct communication. 2001's \"Intercultural Communication: A Discourse Approach\" described the East–West dichotomy linguistically as a \"false dichotomy\", noting that both Asian and Western speakers use both forms of communication.\n\nIn addition to difficulties in defining regions and overlooking hybridity, the East–West dichotomy has been criticized for creating an artificial construct of regional unification that allows one voice to claim authority to speak for multitudes. In \"The Triumph of the East?\", Mark T. Berger speaks to the issue as relates to examination of the \"East-Asian miracle\": \nThe historical power of the East-West dichotomy, and the fixed conceptions of culture/race to which it is linked, have increasingly allowed the national elites of the region to speak not only for their 'nations,' but even for Asia and Asians... There are numerous instances of Western scholars, intent on challenging North American and/or Western hegemony in both material and discursive terms, ending up uncritically privileging the elite narratives of power-holders in Asia as authentic representatives of a particular non-Western nation or social formation (and also contributing to the continued use of the East-West dichotomy).\n\n\nBalancing the East, Upgrading the West; U.S. Grand Strategy in an Age of Upheaval by Zbigniew Brzezinski January/February 2012 Foreign Affairs\n"}
{"id": "6723209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6723209", "title": "Egg Fu", "text": "Egg Fu\n\nEgg Fu is a fictional character appearing in DC Comics publications and related media, commonly as an adversary for the superheroine Wonder Woman.\n\nMost frequently represented as an enormous sentient egg (and often, inexplicably, of Chinese descent), he was created by Robert Kanigher and Ross Andru where he first appeared in \"Wonder Woman\" #157. Over the years, multiple versions of the character have appeared with varying backstories and alternative names (including Egg Fu the Fifth, Chang Tzu, and Dr. Yes) to battle not only Wonder Woman, but also the Metal Men, Checkmate and Harley Quinn.\n\nIn early appearances, the character was a Yellow Peril ethnic stereotype, complete with caricaturish Asian facial features and dialogue written in a phoneticized Chinese accent. His name is an obvious play on the name of a Chinese ethnic dish, egg foo young. Certain 21st-century updates, such as changing his name to \"Chang Tzu\" and affiliating him with DC Comics' Chinese superhero team the Great Ten, maintain his Asian ethnicity while striving to de-emphasize problematic aspects of his historically racialized characterization. Appearances in \"Harley Quinn\" in 2014 and \"Harley Quinn and Power Girl\" in 2015, though restoring the name Egg Fu, have expunged overt associations with Chinese culture and language.\n\nEgg Fu debuted in \"Wonder Woman\" #157 (Oct. 1965). He was a Chinese Communist agent, perplexingly shaped like an egg the size of a house, with a Charlie Chan-like speech pattern, who used his mustaches as whips against his enemies. In Egg Fu's first appearance, Steve Trevor is captured by the Chinese mastermind and turned into a human bomb. Egg Fu then launches Steve and a doomsday missile at the American fleet. Wonder Woman intercepts Steve, who has become a deadly menace. She is unable to save him, but she redirects his path into the enemy missile. The explosion destroys the missile, Steve, and Wonder Woman herself, but the fleet is saved. Informed of her daughter's demise, Queen Hippolyta gathers the remains of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor and returns them to a laboratory on Paradise Island. Using an atomic structure reassembly beam, she restores Steve and her daughter. However, Steve's body is still infused with explosive energy. Wonder Woman finds that her own body has also become explosive, making them both a danger to the world. They leave Paradise Island. Wonder Woman plans to use the explosive power against Egg Fu. The Chinese leader sends his troops against her, but they fail in their task to overcome her. A piece of anti-matter removes the explosive matter from Steve and Wonder Woman, then the Amazon defeats Egg Fu.\n\nEgg Fu the Fifth, a relative of the original Egg Fu, debuted in \"Wonder Woman\" #166 (November 1966).\n\nWonder Woman and Steve Trevor investigate the disappearance of an American submarine. While flying over the ocean where it disappeared, Wonder Woman's plane is fired upon by an enemy freighter. Steve boards the ship, then disappears too.\nWonder Woman's plane is drawn underwater into a giant seashell. Frogmen attack her and take her prisoner. She is brought to a secret base controlled by Egg Fu the Fifth. Held prisoner by her own magic lasso, Wonder Woman offers to dance for Egg Fu. She then performs a bracelet-clashing dance which cracks Egg Fu and allows her to escape and rescue the stolen submarine.\n\nDr. Yes (a reference to Dr. No), Egg Fu's robot twin, appears in \"Metal Men\" #20 (June/July 1966). In the story, he uses a giant robot to capture Will Magnus, thereby luring the Metal Men to his base where he brainwashes them, believing that \"when the Amelicans see how these gleat heroes of theirs have turned tlaitors-- they will doubt \"anyone's\" stlength to lesist us!\"\n\nThe giant robot takes the Metal Men to a football stadium that is celebrating \"I am an American Day\". Fighting the urge to say \"Down with America!\" in front of everyone, the Metal Men self-destruct instead. An angry Dr. Yes tries having the giant robot destroy the crowd instead, but the various pieces of the Metal Men attack and destroy the robot, freeing Magnus who had been trapped inside. Afterwards, Magnus rebuilds the superhero team. Dr. Yes is still at large at the story's end.\n\nFollowing the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", a new version of Egg Fu was introduced in \"Wonder Woman\" vol. 2, #128 (December 1997). This Egg Fu is a nineteenth-century super-computer, recently rediscovered and turned into one of many carnival attractions along Gateway City's Oceanside boardwalk, despite public protests that the attraction is racially insensitive.\n\nEgg Fu is actually a product of Apokoliptian technology created from a device Scott Free accidentally left behind on a visit to Earth. Once activated, it begins dominating people's minds and preparing them for transport to Apokolips. Egg Fu is defeated by Hippolyta (at the time acting as Diana's successor as Wonder Woman), Donna Troy, Artemis and Wonder Girl. An associate of Mister Miracle, Metron, removes it.\n\nFollowing the events of \"Infinite Crisis\", a new version of Egg Fu appears, calling himself Chang Tzu (likely a reference to Chuang Tzu, or possibly Sun Tzu.), an agent of Apokolips.\n\nChang Tzu (Chung Zhu) is the mastermind, along with Bruno \"Ugly\" Mannheim, behind the kidnappings of many mad scientists in the comic book series \"52\". They are forcibly recruited into Chang's \"Science Squad\" based on Oolong Island. Chang has a large, egg-shaped body with facial features and cracked skin, mounted in a spider-legged chair for mobility. He is equipped with small prosthetic hands that allow him to manipulate items and equipment; he is also armed with hidden weaponry.\n\nShortly after Black Adam escapes confinement on Oolong Island, Chang Tzu is shot apart by one of his kidnapped scientists, Dr. Will Magnus. Magnus claims to be acting irrationally due to a lack of medication. A new, smouldering egg was seen hidden in Chang's shattered remains. When he later reappears and is asked about his seeming destruction, he explains, \"My third incubation ended four months ago.\"\n\nChang Tzu later re-appears as the main villain in 2007's \"Checkout\" storyline that crossed over between the Outsiders and Checkmate series. The UN-sponsored clandestine agency devoted to meta-human special operations capture the then-wanted super-hero team led by Nightwing and coerce them into helping invade Oolong Island. A team of operatives from both groups reaches the island, but Sasha Bordeaux and Captain Boomerang are taken captive by Chang Tzu, who subjects them both to excruciatingly torturous studies in order to examine their own respective meta-abilities. Their teammates eventually free them and the group retreats, their mission a failure, with Chang Tzu still remaining at large. While studying her unique physiology consisting of human tissue and artificially intelligent nanotechnology, Chang Tzu takes a morbid interest in Bordeaux, remarking:\n\nAs revealed to Alan Scott by Thundermind, Chang Tzu and his Science Squad are members of the Great Ten that provide, among other things, the funds to operate the organization and the technology they use.\n\nHis name is unclear as it has been inconsistently presented; he is introduced as Chang Tzu, but is subsequently referred to as both Chung Zhu and Chung Tzu. It may be possible that he has multiple names; Chang himself explains that \"Egg Fu\" is one of his \"Nine thousand and nine unmentionable names\", and immediately kills a guard who laughs at his mention of it.\n\nChang Tzu reappeared in a short story published in \"Wonder Woman\" #600, where he was defeated by Wonder Woman, Power Girl, and Batgirl.\n\nIn the New 52, Egg Fu appeared in \"Harley Quinn Annual\" #1. In the comic, he is Edgar Fullerton Yeung, a giant egg scientist who is secretly experimenting on Poison Ivy at Arkham Asylum. However, he ends up reforming with the help of Harley Quinn and gets himself a job.\n\nEgg Fu appears throughout the DC Rebirth iteration of the \"Harley Quinn\" series.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The first episode was broadcast on BBC Two on 11 January 2006. A second series began on 12 July 2007 on BBC Two.\n\n\nThe design for HMS \"Camden Lock\" was based loosely upon the BT Tower in London. It is a 'Wendover' class ship and measures long by wide. The ship's registration is XH558 - the same serial number as the last flying Avro Vulcan bomber.

{"id": "15041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15041", "title": "Improvisational theatre", "text": "Improvisational theatre\n\nImprovisational theatre, often called provisation or improv, is the form of theatre, often comedy, in which most or all of what is performed is unplanned or unscripted: created spontaneously by the performers. In its purest form, the dialogue, action, story, and characters are created collaboratively by the players as the improvisation unfolds in present time, without use of an already prepared, written script.\n\nImprovisational theatre exists in performance as a range of styles of improvisational comedy as well as some non-comedic theatrical performances. It is sometimes used in film and television, both to develop characters and scripts and occasionally as part of the final product.\n\nImprovisational techniques are often used extensively in drama programs to train actors for stage, film, and television and can be an important part of the rehearsal process. However, the skills and processes of improvisation are also used outside the context of performing arts - Applied Improvisation. It is used in classrooms as an educational tool and in businesses as a way to develop communication skills, creative problem solving, and supportive team-work abilities that are used by improvisational, ensemble players. It is sometimes used in psychotherapy as a tool to gain insight into a person's thoughts, feelings, and relationships.\n\nThe earliest well documented use of improvisational theatre in Western history is found in the Atellan Farce of 391 BC. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, \"commedia dell'arte\" performers improvised based on a broad outline in the streets of Italy. In the 1890s, theatrical theorists and directors such as the Russian Konstantin Stanislavski and the French Jacques Copeau, founders of two major streams of acting theory, both heavily utilized improvisation in acting training and rehearsal.\n\nModern theatrical improvisation games began as drama exercises for children, which were a staple of drama education in the early 20th century thanks in part to the progressive education movement initiated by John Dewey in 1916. Some people credit American Dudley Riggs as the first vaudevillian to use audience suggestions to create improvised sketches on stage. Improvisation exercises were developed further by Viola Spolin in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, and codified in her book \"Improvisation For The Theater\", the first book that gave specific techniques for learning to do and teach improvisational theater. In the 1970s in Canada, British playwright and director Keith Johnstone wrote \"\", a book outlining his ideas on improvisation, and invented Theatresports, which has become a staple of modern improvisational comedy and is the inspiration for the popular television show \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\"\n\nSpolin influenced the first generation of modern American improvisers at The Compass Players in Chicago, which led to The Second City. Her son, Paul Sills, along with David Shepherd, started The Compass Players. Following the demise of the Compass Players, Paul Sills began The Second City. They were the first organized troupes in Chicago, and the modern Chicago improvisational comedy movement grew from their success.\n\nMany of the current \"rules\" of comedic improv were first formalized in Chicago in the late 1950s and early 1960s, initially among The Compass Players troupe, which was directed by Paul Sills. From most accounts, David Shepherd provided the philosophical vision of the Compass Players, while Elaine May was central to the development of the premises for its improvisations. Mike Nichols, Ted Flicker, and Del Close were her most frequent collaborators in this regard. When The Second City opened its doors on December 16, 1959, directed by Paul Sills, his mother Viola Spolin began training new improvisers through a series of classes and exercises which became the cornerstone of modern improv training. By the mid-1960s, Viola Spolin's classes were handed over to her protégé, Jo Forsberg, who further developed Spolin's methods into a one-year course, which eventually became The Players Workshop, the first official school of improvisation in the USA. During this time, Forsberg trained many of the performers who went on to star on The Second City stage.\n\nMany of the original cast of \"Saturday Night Live\" came from The Second City, and the franchise has produced such comedy stars as Mike Myers, Tina Fey, Bob Odenkirk, Amy Sedaris, Stephen Colbert, Eugene Levy, Jack McBrayer, Steve Carell, Chris Farley, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi.\n\nSimultaneously, Keith Johnstone's group The Theatre Machine, which originated in London, was touring Europe. This work gave birth to Theatresports, at first secretly in Johnstone's workshops, and eventually in public when he moved to Canada. Toronto has been home to a rich improv tradition.\n\nIn 1984, Dick Chudnow (Kentucky Fried Theater) founded ComedySportz in Milwaukee, WI. Expansion began with the addition of ComedySportz-Madison (WI), in 1985. The first Comedy League of America National Tournament was held in 1988, with 10 teams participating. The league is now known as CSz Worldwide and boasts a roster of 29 international cities.\n\nIn San Francisco, The Committee theater was active in North Beach during the 1960s. It was founded by alumni of Chicago's Second City, Alan Myerson and his wife Jessica. When The Committee disbanded in 1972, three major companies were formed: The Pitchell Players, The Wing, and Improvisation Inc. The only company that continued to perform Close's Harold was the latter one. Its two former members, Michael Bossier and John Elk, formed Spaghetti Jam in San Francisco's Old Spaghetti Factory in 1976, where shortform improv and Harolds were performed through 1983. Stand-up comedians performing down the street at the Intersection for the Arts would drop by and sit in. In 1979, Elk brought shortform to England, teaching workshops at Jacksons Lane Theatre, and he was the first American to perform at The Comedy Store, London, above a Soho strip club.\n\nModern political improvisation's roots include Jerzy Grotowski's work in Poland during the late 1950s and early 1960s, Peter Brook's \"happenings\" in England during the late 1960s, Augusto Boal's \"Forum Theatre\" in South America in the early 1970s, and San Francisco's The Diggers' work in the 1960s. Some of this work led to pure improvisational performance styles, while others simply added to the theatrical vocabulary and were, on the whole, avant-garde experiments.\n\nJoan Littlewood, an English actress and director who was active from the 1930s to 1970s, made extensive use of improv in developing plays for performance. However, she was successfully prosecuted twice for allowing her actors to improvise in performance. Until 1968, British law required scripts to be approved by the Lord Chamberlain's Office. The department also sent inspectors to some performances to check that the approved script was performed exactly as approved.\n\nIn 1987, Annoyance Theatre began as a club in Chicago that emphasizes longform improvisation. The Annoyance Theatre has grown into multiple locations in Chicago and New York City. It is the home of the longest running musical improv show in history at 11 years. \n\nIn 2012, Lebanese writer and director Lucien Bourjeily used improvisational theater techniques to create a multi-sensory play entitled \"66 Minutes in Damascus\". This play premiered at the London International Festival of Theater, and is considered one of the most extreme kinds of interactive improvised theater put on stage. The audience play the part of kidnapped tourists in today's Syria in a hyperreal sensory environment.\n\nRob Wittig and Mark C. Marino have developed a form of improv for online theatrical improvisation called netprov. The form relies on social media to engage audiences in the creation of dynamic fictional scenarios that evolve in real-time.\n\nModern improvisational comedy, as it is practiced in the West, falls generally into two categories: shortform and longform.\n\nShortform improv consists of short scenes usually constructed from a predetermined game, structure, or idea and driven by an audience suggestion. Many shortform exercises were first created by Viola Spolin, who called them theater games, influenced by her training from recreational games expert Neva Boyd. The shortform improv comedy television series \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\" has familiarized American and British viewers with shortform.\n\nLongform improv performers create shows in which short scenes are often interrelated by story, characters, or themes. Longform shows may take the form of an existing type of theatre, for example a full-length play or Broadway-style musical such as Spontaneous Broadway. One of the better-known longform structures is the Harold, developed by ImprovOlympic co-founder Del Close. Many such longform structures now exist. Longform improvisation is especially performed in Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles; has a strong presence in Austin, Boston, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, Detroit, Toronto, Vancouver, Washington, D.C.; and is building a growing following in Denver, Montreal, Kansas City, Columbus, New Orleans, Omaha, Rochester, and Hawaii. Outside the United States, longform improv has a growing presence in the United Kingdom, especially in cities such as London, Bristol, and at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\nOther forms of improvisational theatre training and performance techniques are experimental and avant-garde in nature and not necessarily intended to be comedic. These include Playback Theatre and Theatre of the Oppressed, the Poor Theatre, the Open Theatre, to name only a few.\n\nThe Open Theatre was founded in New York City by a group of former students of acting teacher Nola Chilton, and joined shortly thereafter by director Joseph Chaikin, formerly of The Living Theatre, and Peter Feldman. This avante-garde theatre group explored political, artistic, and social issues. The company, developing work through an improvisational process drawn from Chilton and Viola Spolin, created well-known exercises, such as \"sound and movement\" and \"transformations\", and originated radical forms and techniques that anticipated or were contemporaneous with Jerzy Grotowski's \"poor theater\" in Poland.[1] During the sixties Chaikin and the Open Theatre developed full theatrical productions with nothing but the actors, a few chairs and a bare stage, creating character, time and place through a series of transformations the actors physicalized and discovered through improvisations.\n\nLongform, dramatic, and narrative-based improvisation is well-established on the west coast with companies such as San Francisco's BATS Improv. This format allows for full-length plays and musicals to be created improvisationally.\n\nMany people who have studied improv have noted that the guiding principles of improv are useful, not just on stage, but in everyday life. For example, Stephen Colbert in a commencement address said,\n\nTina Fey in her book \"Bossypants\" lists several rules of improv that apply in the workplace. There has been much interest in bringing lessons from improv into the corporate world. In a New York Times article titled \"Can Executives Learn to Ignore the Script?\", Stanford professor and author, Patricia Ryan Madson notes, \"executives and engineers and people in transition are looking for support in saying yes to their own voice. Often, the systems we put in place to keep us secure are keeping us from our more creative selves.\"\n\nMany directors have made use of improvisation in the creation of both mainstream and experimental films. Many silent filmmakers such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton used improvisation in the making of their films, developing their gags while filming and altering the plot to fit. The Marx Brothers were notorious for deviating from the script they were given, their ad libs often becoming part of the standard routine and making their way into their films. Many people, however, make a distinction between ad-libbing and improvising.\n\nThe British director Mike Leigh makes extensive use of improvisation in the creation of his films, including improvising important moments in the characters' lives that will not even appear in the film. \"This Is Spinal Tap\" and other mockumentary films of director Christopher Guest are created with a mix of scripted and unscripted material and \"Blue in the Face\" is a 1995 comedy directed by Wayne Wang and Paul Auster created in part by the improvisations during the filming of \"Smoke\".\n\nSome of the best known American film directors who are noted for their use of improvisation in their work with actors are John Cassavetes, Robert Altman, Christopher Guest and Rob Reiner.\n\nImprov comedy techniques have also been used in television and stand-up comedy in hit shows such as HBO's television show \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" created by Larry David, the UK Channel 4 and ABC television series \"Whose Line Is It Anyway\" (and its spinoffs \"Drew Carey's Green Screen Show\" and \"Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza\"), Nick Cannon's improv comedy show \"Wild 'N Out\", and \"Thank God You're Here\". In Canada, the series \"Train 48\" was improvised from scripts which contained a minimal outline of each scene, and the comedy series \"This Sitcom Is...Not to Be Repeated\" incorporated dialogue drawn from a hat during the course of an episode. The American show \"Reno 911!\" also contained improvised dialogue based on a plot outline. \"Fast and Loose\" is an improvisational game show, much like \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\". The BBC sitcoms \"Outnumbered\" and \"The Thick of It\" also had some improvised elements in them.\n\nIn the field of the psychology of consciousness, Eberhard Scheiffele explored the altered state of consciousness experienced by actors and improvisers in his scholarly paper \"Acting: an altered state of consciousness\". According to G. William Farthing in \"The Psychology of Consciousness\" comparative study, actors routinely enter into an altered state of consciousness (ASC). Acting is seen as altering most of the 14 dimensions of changed subjective experience which characterize ASCs according to Farthing, namely: attention, perception, imagery and fantasy, inner speech, memory, higher-level thought processes, meaning or significance of experiences, time experience, emotional feeling and expression, level of arousal, self-control, suggestibility, body image, and sense of personal identity.\n\nIn the growing field of Drama Therapy, psychodramatic improvisation, along with other techniques developed for Drama Therapy, are used extensively. The \"\"Yes, and\"\" rule has been compared to Milton Erickson's \"utilization\" process and to a variety of acceptance-based psychotherapies. Improv training has been recommended for couples therapy and therapist training, and it has been speculated that improv training may be helpful in some cases of social anxiety disorder.\n\nImprovisational theatre often allows an interactive relationship with the audience. Improv groups frequently solicit suggestions from the audience as a source of inspiration, a way of getting the audience involved, and as a means of proving that the performance is not scripted. That charge is sometimes aimed at the masters of the art, whose performances can seem so detailed that viewers may suspect the scenes are planned.\n\nIn order for an improvised scene to be successful, the improvisers involved must work together responsively to define the parameters and action of the scene, in a process of co-creation. With each spoken word or action in the scene, an improviser makes an \"offer\", meaning that he or she defines some element of the reality of the scene. This might include giving another character a name, identifying a relationship, location, or using mime to define the physical environment. These activities are also known as \"endowment\". It is the responsibility of the other improvisers to accept the offers that their fellow performers make; to not do so is known as blocking, negation, or denial, which usually prevents the scene from developing. Some performers may deliberately block (or otherwise break out of character) for comedic effect—this is known as \"gagging\"—but this generally prevents the scene from advancing and is frowned upon by many improvisers. Accepting an offer is usually accompanied by adding a new offer, often building on the earlier one; this is a process improvisers refer to as \"\"Yes, And...\"\" and is considered the cornerstone of improvisational technique. Every new piece of information added helps the improvisers to refine their characters and progress the action of the scene. The \"Yes, And...\" rule, however, applies to a scene's early stage since it is in this stage that a \"base (or shared) reality\" is established in order to be later redefined by applying the \"if (this is true), then (what else can also be true)\" practice progressing the scene into comedy, as explained in the 2013 manual by the \"Upright Citizens Brigade\" members.\n\nThe unscripted nature of improv also implies no predetermined knowledge about the props that might be useful in a scene. Improv companies may have at their disposal some number of readily accessible props that can be called upon at a moment's notice, but many improvisers eschew props in favor of the infinite possibilities available through mime. In improv, this is more commonly known as 'space object work' or 'space work', not 'mime', and the props and locations created by this technique, as 'space objects' created out of 'space substance,' developed as a technique by Viola Spolin. As with all improv \"offers\", improvisers are encouraged to respect the validity and continuity of the imaginary environment defined by themselves and their fellow performers; this means, for example, taking care not to walk through the table or \"miraculously\" survive multiple bullet wounds from another improviser's gun.\n\nBecause improvisers may be required to play a variety of roles without preparation, they need to be able to construct characters quickly with physicality, gestures, accents, voice changes, or other techniques as demanded by the situation. The improviser may be called upon to play a character of a different age or sex. Character motivations are an important part of successful improv scenes, and improvisers must therefore attempt to act according to the objectives that they believe their character seeks.\n\nMany theatre troupes are devoted to staging improvisational performances and growing the improv community through their training centers.\n\nIn addition to for-profit theatre troupes, there are many college-based improv groups in the United States and around the world.\n\nIn Europe the special contribution to the theatre of the abstract, the surreal, the irrational and the subconscious have been part of the stage tradition for centuries. From the 1990s onwards a growing number of European Improv groups have been set up specifically to explore the possibilities offered by the use of the abstract in improvised performance, including dance, movement, sound, music, mask work, lighting, and so on. These groups are not especially interested in comedy, either as a technique or as an effect, but rather in expanding the improv genre so as to incorporate techniques and approaches that have long been a legitimate part of European theatre.\n\nSome key figures in the development of improvisational theatre are Viola Spolin and her son Paul Sills, founder of Chicago's famed Second City troupe and originator of Theater Games, and Del Close, founder of ImprovOlympic (along with Charna Halpern) and creator of a popular longform improv format known as The Harold. Other luminaries include Keith Johnstone, the British teacher and writer–author of \"Impro\", who founded the Theatre Machine and whose teachings form the foundation of the popular shortform Theatresports format, Dick Chudnow, founder of ComedySportz which evolved its family-friendly show format from Johnstone's Theatersports, and Bill Johnson, creator/director of The Magic Meathands, who pioneered the concept of \"Commun-edy Outreach\" by tailoring performances to non-traditional audiences, such as the homeless and foster children.\n\nDavid Shepherd, with Paul Sills, founded The Compass Players in Chicago. Shepherd was intent on developing a true \"people's Theatre\", and hoped to bring political drama to the stockyards. The Compass went on to play in numerous forms and companies, in a number of cities including NY and Hyannis, after the founding of The Second City. A number of Compass members were also founding members of The Second City. In the 1970s, Shepherd began experimenting with group-created videos. He is the author of \"That Movie In Your Head\", about these efforts. In the 1970s, David Shepherd and Howard Jerome created the Improvisational Olympics, a format for competition based improv. The Improv Olympics were first demonstrated at Toronto's Homemade Theatre in 1976 and have been continued on as the Canadian Improv Games. In the United States, the Improv Olympics were later produced by Charna Halpern under the name \"ImprovOlympic\" and now as \"IO\"; IO operates training centers and theaters in Chicago and Los Angeles. At IO, Halpern combined Shepherd's \"Time Dash\" game with Del Close's \"Harold\" game; the revised format for the Harold became the fundamental structure for the development of modern longform improvisation.\n\nIn 1975 Jonathan Fox founded Playback Theatre, a form of improvised community theatre which is often not comedic and replays stories as shared by members of the audience.\n\nThe Groundlings is a popular and influential improv theatre and training center in Los Angeles, California. Gary Austin, founder of The Groundlings, continues to teach improvisation around the country, focusing especially in Los Angeles. He is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest acting teachers in America. His work is grounded in the lessons he learned as an improviser at The Committee with Del Close, as well as in his experiences as founding director of The Groundlings. The Groundlings is often seen as the Los Angeles training ground for the \"second generation\" of improv luminaries and troupes. Stan Wells developed the \"Clap-In\" style of longform improvisation here, later using this as the basis for his own theatre, The Empty Stage which in turn bred multiple troupes utilizing this style.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Matt Besser, Amy Poehler, Ian Roberts, and Matt Walsh founded the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York and later they founded one in Los Angeles, each with an accompanying improv/sketch comedy school. In September 2011 the UCB opened a third theatre in New York City's East Village, known as UCBeast.\n\nGunter Lösel compared the existing improvisational theater theories (from Moreno, Spolin, Johnstone, Close...), structured them and wrote a general theory of improvisational theater.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28702283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28702283", "title": "Islam and violence", "text": "Islam and violence\n\nMainstream Islamic law stipulates detailed regulations for the use of violence, including the use of violence within the family or household, the use of corporal and capital punishment, as well as how, when and against whom to wage war.\n\nSharia or sharia law is the basic Islamic religious law derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the Quran and the opinions and life example of Muhammad (Hadith and Sunnah) which are the primary sources of sharia. For topics and issues not directly addressed in these primary sources, sharia is derived. The derivation differs between the various sects of Islam (Sunni and Shia are the majority), and various jurisprudence schools such as Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali and Jafari. The sharia in these schools is derived hierarchically using one or more of the following guidelines: Ijma (usually the consensus of Muhammad's companions), Qiyas (analogy derived from the primary sources), Istihsan (ruling that serves the interest of Islam in the discretion of Islamic jurists) and Urf (customs). Sharia is a significant source of legislation in various Muslim countries. Some apply all or a majority of the sharia, and these include Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Brunei, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Yemen and Mauritania. In these countries, sharia-prescribed punishments such as beheading, flogging and stoning continue to be practiced judicially or extrajudicially. The introduction of sharia is a longstanding goal for Islamist movements globally, but attempts to impose sharia have been accompanied by controversy, violence, and even warfare.\nThe differences between sharia and secular law have led to an ongoing controversy as to whether sharia is compatible with secular forms of government, human rights, freedom of thought, and women's rights.\n\nThe first military rulings were formulated during the first hundred years after Muhammad established an Islamic state in Medina. These rulings evolved in accordance with the interpretations of the Quran (the Muslim Holy scriptures) and Hadith (the recorded traditions of Muhammad). The key themes in these rulings were the justness of war (see Justice in the Quran), and the injunction to jihad. The rulings do not cover feuds and armed conflicts in general. The millennium of Muslim conquests could be classified, technically, as a religious war.\n\nSome have pointed out that the current Western view of the need for a clear separation between Church and State was only first legislated into effect after 18 centuries of Christianity in the Western world. While some majority Muslim governments such as Turkey and many of the majority Muslim former Soviet republics have officially attempted to incorporate this principle of such a separation of powers into their governments, the concept within the Muslim world yet remains somewhat in a state of ongoing evolution and flux.\n\nIslam has never had any officially recognized tradition of pacifism, and throughout its history warfare has been an integral part of the Islamic theological system. Since the time of Muhammad, Islam has considered warfare to be a legitimate expression of religious faith, and has accepted its use for the defense of Islam. During approximately the first 1,000 years of its existence, the use of warfare by Muslim majority governments often resulted in the de facto propagation of Islam.\n\nWhile the early spread of Islam was often borne on the back of military conquest, within Christianity its early spread was often a matter of political expediency. The minority Sufi movement within Islam, which includes certain pacifist elements, has often been officially \"tolerated\" by many Muslim majority governments. Additionally, some notable Muslim clerics, such as Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan have developed alternative non-violent Muslim theologies. Some hold that the formal juristic definition of war in Islam constitutes an irrevokable and permanent link within Islam between the political and religious justifications for war. The Quranic concept of \"Jihad\" includes aspects of both a physical and an internal struggle.\n\nJihad () is an Islamic term referring to the religious duty of Muslims to maintain the religion. In Arabic, the word \"jihād\" is a noun meaning \"to strive, to apply oneself, to struggle, to persevere\". A person engaged in jihad is called a \"mujahid\", the plural of which is \"mujahideen\" (). The word \"jihad\" appears frequently in the Quran, often in the idiomatic expression \"striving in the way of God \"(al-jihad fi sabil Allah)\"\", to refer to the act of striving to serve the purposes of God on this earth. According to the classical Sharia law manual of Shafi'i, Reliance of the Traveller, Jihad means to war against non-Muslims, and is etymologically derived from the word mujahada signifying warfare to establish the religion. Jihad is sometimes referred to as the sixth pillar of Islam, though it occupies no such official status. In Twelver Shi'a Islam, however, jihad is one of the ten Practices of the Religion.\n\nMuslims and scholars do not all agree on its definition. Many observers—both Muslim and non-Muslim—as well as the \"Dictionary of Islam\", talk of jihad having two meanings: an inner spiritual struggle (the \"greater jihad\"), and an outer physical struggle against the enemies of Islam (the \"lesser jihad\") which may take a violent or non-violent form. Jihad is often translated as \"Holy War\", although this term is controversial. According to orientalist Bernard Lewis, \"the overwhelming majority of classical theologians, jurists\", and specialists in the hadith \"understood the obligation of jihad in a military sense.\" Javed Ahmad Ghamidi states that there is consensus among Islamic scholars that the concept of jihad will always include armed struggle against wrongdoers.\n\nAccording to Jonathan Berkey, jihad in the Quran was maybe originally intended against Muhammad's local enemies, the pagans of Mecca or the Jews of Medina, but the Quranic statements supporting jihad could be redirected once new enemies appeared. The first documentation of the law of Jihad was written by 'Abd al-Rahman al-Awza'i and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani.\n\nThe first forms of military Jihad occurred after the migration (hijra) of Muhammad and his small group of followers to Medina from Mecca and the conversion of several inhabitants of the city to Islam. The first revelation concerning the struggle against the Meccans was surah 22, verses 39–40:\nThe main focus of Muhammad's later years was increasing the number of allies as well as the amount of territory under Muslim control.\n\nAccording to Richard Edwards and Sherifa Zuhur, offensive jihad was the type of jihad practiced by the early Muslim community, because their weakness meant \"no defensive action would have sufficed to protect them against the allied tribal forces determined to exterminate them.\" Jihad as a collective duty (\"Fard Kifaya\") and offensive jihad are synonymous in classical Islamic law and tradition, which also asserted that offensive jihad could only be declared by the caliph, but an \"individually incumbent jihad\" (\"Fard Ayn\") required only \"awareness of an oppression targeting Islam or Islamic peoples.\"\n\nTina Magaard, associate professor at the Aarhus University Department of Business Development and Technology, has analyzed the texts of the 10 largest religions in the world. In an interview, she stated that the basic texts of Islam call for violence and aggression against followers of other faiths to a greater extent than texts of other religions. She has also argued that they contain direct incitements to terrorism.\n\nAccording to a number of sources, Shia doctrine taught that jihad (or at least full scale jihad) can only be carried out under the leadership of the Imam (who will return from occultation to bring absolute justice to the world). However, \"struggles to defend Islam\" are permissible before his return.\n\nGhazi () is an Arabic term originally referring to an individual who participates in Ghazw (غزو), meaning military expeditions or raiding; after the emergence of Islam, it took on new connotations of religious warfare. The related word Ghazwa (غزوة) is a singulative form meaning a battle or military expedition, often one led by Muhammad.\n\nThe Caravan raids were a series of raids in which Muhammed and his companions participated. The raids were generally offensive and carried out to gather intelligence or seize the trade goods of caravans financed by the Quraysh. The raids were intended to weaken the economy of Mecca by Muhammad. His followers were also impoverished. Muhammad broke an Arab tradition of not attacking one's own kinsmen by raiding caravans.\n\nIslamic Doctrines teachings on matters of war and peace have become topics of heated discussion in recent years. Charles Matthews writes that there is a \"large debate about what the Quran commands as regards the 'sword verses' and the 'peace verses'\". According to Matthews, \"the question of the proper prioritization of these verses, and how they should be understood in relation to one another, has been a central issue for Islamic thinking about war.\" According to Dipak Gupta, \"much of the religious justification of violence against nonbelievers (Dar ul Kufr) by the promoters of jihad is based on the Quranic “sword verses.”\nThe Quran contains passages that could be used to glorify or endorse violence.\n\nOn the other hand, other scholars argue that such verses of the Qur'an are interpreted out of context, Micheline R. Ishay has argued that \"the Quran justifies wars for self-defense to protect Islamic communities against internal or external aggression by non-Islamic populations, and wars waged against those who 'violate their oaths' by breaking a treaty\". and British orientalist Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner stated that jihad, even in self-defence, is \"strictly limited\".\n\nHowever, according to Oliver Leaman, a number of Islamic jurists asserted the primacy of the “sword verses” over the conciliatory verses in specific historical circumstances. For example, according to Diane Morgan, Ibn Kathir (1301–1372) asserted that the Sword Verse abrogated all peace treaties that had been promulgated between Muhammad and idolaters.\n\nIslamic modernists reject the abrogating status of the sword verses, which would result in the abrogation (naskh) of numerous Quranic verses that counsel peace and reconciliation.\n\nPrior to the Hijra travel Muhammad struggled non-violently against his oppressors in Mecca. It wasn't until after the exile that the Quranic revelations began to adopt a more defensive perspective. From that point onward, those dubious about the need to go to war were typically portrayed as lazy cowards allowing their love of peace to become a fitna to them.\n\nThe context of the Quran is elucidated by Hadith (the teachings, deeds and sayings of Muhammad). Of the 199 references to jihad in perhaps the most standard collection of hadith—Bukhari—all refer to warfare.\n\nQuranists reject the hadith and follow the Quran only. The extent to which Quranists reject the authenticity of the Sunnah varies, but the more established groups have thoroughly criticised the authenticity of the hadith and refused it for many reasons, the most prevalent being the Quranist claim that hadith is not mentioned in the Quran as a source of Islamic theology and practice, was not recorded in written form until more than two centuries after the death of Muhammed, and contain perceived internal errors and contradictions.\n\nAccording to Ahmadi Muslim belief, Jihad can be divided into three categories: \"Jihad al-Akbar\" (Greater Jihad) is that against the self and refers to striving against one's low desires such as anger, lust and hatred; \"Jihad al-Kabīr\" (Great Jihad) refers to the peaceful propagation of Islam, with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the \"pen\"; \"Jihad al-Asghar\" (Smaller Jihad) is only for self-defence under situations of extreme religious persecution whilst not being able to follow one's fundamental religious beliefs, and even then only under the direct instruction of the Caliph. Ahmadi Muslims point out that as per Islamic prophecy, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad rendered Jihad in its military form as inapplicable in the present age as Islam, as a religion, is not being attacked militarily but through literature and other media, and therefore the response should be likewise. They believe that the answer of hate should be given by love. Concerning terrorism, the fourth Caliph of the Community writes:\nVarious Ahmadis scholars, such as Muhammad Ali, Maulana Sadr-ud-Din and Basharat Ahmad, argue that when the Quran's verses are read in context, it clearly appears that the Quran prohibits initial aggression, and allows fighting only in self-defense.\n\nAhmadi Muslims believe that no verse of the Quran abrogates or cancels another verse. All Quranic verses have equal validity, in keeping with their emphasis on the \"unsurpassable beauty and unquestionable validity of the Qur'ān\". The harmonization of apparently incompatible rulings is resolved through their juridical deflation in Ahmadī \"fiqh\", so that a ruling (considered to have applicability only to the specific situation for which it was revealed), is effective not because it was revealed last, but because it is most suited to the situation at hand.\n\nAhmadis are considered non-Muslims by the mainstream Muslims since they consider Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, founder of Ahmadiyya, as the promised Mahdi and Messiah. In a number of Islamic countries, especially Sunni-dominated nations, Ahmadis have been considered heretics and non-Muslim, and have been subject to various forms of religious persecution, discrimination and systematic oppression since the movement's inception in 1889.\n\nThe Islamic criminal law is criminal law in accordance with Sharia. Strictly speaking, Islamic law does not have a distinct corpus of \"criminal law.\" It divides crimes into three different categories depending on the offense – \"Hudud\" (crimes \"against God\", whose punishment is fixed in the Quran and the Hadiths); \"Qisas\" (crimes against an individual or family whose punishment is equal retaliation in the Quran and the Hadiths); and \"Tazir\" (crimes whose punishment is not specified in the Quran and the Hadiths, and is left to the discretion of the ruler or Qadi, i.e. judge). Some add the fourth category of \"Siyasah\" (crimes against government), while others consider it as part of either Hadd or Tazir crimes.\n\n\nThese punishments range from public lashing to publicly stoning to death, amputation of hands and crucifixion. However, in most Muslim nations in modern times public stoning and execution are relatively uncommon, although they are found in Muslim nations that follow a strict interpretation of \"sharia\", such as Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\nBeheading was the normal method of executing the death penalty under classical Islamic law. It was also, together with hanging, one of the ordinary methods of execution in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nCurrently, Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world which uses decapitation within its Islamic legal system. The majority of executions carried out by the Wahhabi government of Saudi Arabia are public beheadings, which usually cause mass gatherings but are not allowed to be photographed or filmed.\n\nBeheading is reported to have been carried out by state authorities in Iran as recently as 2001, but as of 2014 is no longer in use.\nIt is also a legal form of execution in Qatar and Yemen, but the punishment has been suspended in those countries.\n\nIn recent times, non-state Jihadist organization such as ISIS and Tawhid and Jihad use or have used beheadings. Since 2002, they have circulated beheading videos as a form of terror and propaganda. Their actions have been condemned by other militant and terrorist groups, and well as by mainstream Islamic scholars and organizations.\n\nRajm () is an Arabic word that means \"stoning\". It is commonly used to refer to the \"Hudud\" punishment wherein an organized group throws stones at a convicted individual until that person dies. Under Islamic law, it is the prescribed punishment in cases of adultery committed by a married man or married woman. The conviction requires a confession from either the adulterer/adulteress, or the testimony of four witnesses (as prescribed by the Quran in Surah an-Nur verse 4), or pregnancy outside of marriage.\n\n\"See below Sexual crimes\"\n\nBlasphemy in Islam is impious utterance or action concerning God, Muhammad or anything considered sacred in Islam. The Quran admonishes blasphemy, but does not specify any worldly punishment for it. The hadiths, which are another source of Sharia, suggest various punishments for blasphemy, which may include death. There are a number of surah in Qur'an relating to blasphemy, from which Quranic verses 5:33 and 33:57-61 have been most commonly used in Islamic history to justify and punish blasphemers. Various fiqhs (schools of jurisprudence) of Islam have different punishment for blasphemy, depending on whether blasphemer is Muslim or non-Muslim, man or woman. The punishment can be fines, imprisonment, flogging, amputation, hanging, or beheading.\n\nMuslim clerics may call for the punishment of an alleged blasphemer by issuing a fatwā.\n\nAccording to Islamic sources Nadr ibn al-Harith, who was an Arab Pagan doctor from Taif, used to tell stories of Rustam and Esfandiyār to the Arabs and scoffed Muhammad. After the battle of Badr, al-Harith was captured and, in retaliation, Muhammad ordered his execution in hands of Ali.\n\nApostasy in Islam is commonly defined as the conscious abandonment of Islam by a Muslim in word or through deed. A majority considers apostasy in Islam to be some form of religious crime, although a minority does not.\n\nThe definition of apostasy from Islam and its appropriate punishment(s) are controversial, and they vary among Islamic scholars. Apostasy in Islam may include in its scope not only the renunciation of Islam by a Muslim and the joining of another religion or becoming non-religious, or questioning or denying any \"fundamental tenet or creed\" of Islam such as the divinity of God, prophethood of Muhammad, or mocking God, or worshipping one or more idols. The apostate (or murtadd مرتد) term has also been used for people of religions that trace their origins to Islam, such as the Bahá'ís in Iran, but who were never actually Muslims themselves. Apostasy in Islam does not include acts against Islam or conversion to another religion that is involuntary, due mental disorders, forced or done as concealment out of fear of persecution or during war (Taqiyya or Kitman).\n\nHistorically, the majority of Islamic scholars considered apostasy a hudud crime as well as a sin, an act of treason punishable with the death penalty, and the Islamic law on apostasy and the punishment one of the immutable laws under Islam. The punishment for apostasy includes state enforced annulment of his or her marriage, seizure of the person's children and property with automatic assignment to guardians and heirs, and a death penalty for apostates, typically after a waiting period to allow the apostate time to repent and return to Islam. Female apostates could be either executed, according to Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh), or imprisoned until she reverts to Islam as advocated by the Sunni Hanafi school and by Shi'a scholars. The kind of apostasy generally deemed to be punishable by the jurists was of the political kind, although there were considerable legal differences of opinion on this matter. There where early Islamic scholars that did not agree with the death penalty and prescribed indefinite imprisonment until repentance. The Hanafi jurist Sarakhsi also called for different punishments between the non-seditious religious apostasy and that of seditious and political nature, or high treason. Some modern scholars also argue that the death penalty is an inappropriate punishment, inconsistent with the Quranic injunctions such as Quran 88:21-22 or \"no compulsion in religion\"; and/or that it is not a general rule but enacted at a time when the early Muslim community faced enemies who threatened its unity, safety, and security, and needed to prevent and punish the equivalent of desertion or treason, and should be enforced only if apostasy becomes a mechanism of public disobedience and disorder (\"fitna\"). According to Khalid Abu El Fadl, moderate Muslims reject such penalty.\n\nTo the Ahmadi Muslim sect, there is no punishment for apostasy, neither in the Qur'an nor as taught by the founder of Islam, Muhammad. This position of the Ahmadi sect is not widely accepted in other sects of Islam, and the Ahmadi sect acknowledges that major sects have a different interpretation and definition of apostasy in Islam. Ulama of major sects of Islam consider the Ahmadi Muslim sect as kafirs (infidels) and apostates.\n\nUnder current laws in Islamic countries, the actual punishment for the apostate ranges from execution to prison term to no punishment. Islamic nations with sharia courts use civil code to void the Muslim apostate's marriage and deny child custody rights, as well as his or her inheritance rights for apostasy. Twenty-three Muslim-majority countries, as of 2013, additionally covered apostasy in Islam through their criminal laws. Today, apostasy is a crime in 23 out 49 Muslim majority countries; in many other Muslim nations such as Indonesia and Morocco, apostasy is indirectly covered by other laws. It is subject in some countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, to the death penalty, although executions for apostasy are rare. Apostasy is legal in secular Muslim countries such as Turkey. In numerous Islamic majority countries, many individuals have been arrested and punished for the crime of apostasy without any associated capital crimes. In a 2013 report based on an international survey of religious attitudes, more than 50% of the Muslim population in 6 Islamic countries supported the death penalty for any Muslim who leaves Islam (apostasy). A similar survey of the Muslim population in the United Kingdom, in 2007, found nearly a third of 16 to 24-year-old faithfuls believed that Muslims who convert to another religion should be executed, while less than a fifth of those over 55 believed the same.\n\nZina is an Islamic law, both in the four schools of Sunni fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and the two schools of Shi'a fiqh, concerning unlawful sexual relations between Muslims who are not married to one another through a Nikah. It includes extramarital sex and premarital sex, such as adultery (consensual sexual relations outside marriage), fornication (consensual sexual intercourse between two unmarried persons), illegal sex by a slave girl, and homosexuality (consensual sexual relations between same-sex partners). Traditionally, a married or unmarried Muslim male could have sex outside marriage with a non-Muslim slave girl, with or without her consent, and such sex was not considered zina.\n\nAccording to Quran 24:4, the proof that adultery has occurred requires four eyewitnesses to the act, which must have been committed by a man and a woman not validly married to one another, and the act must have been wilfully committed by consenting adults. Proof can also be determined by a confession. But this confession must be voluntary, and based on legal counsel; it must be repeated on four separate occasions, and made by a person who is sane. Otherwise, the accuser is then accorded a sentence for defamation (which means flogging or a prison sentence), and his or her testimony is excluded in all future court cases. There is disagreement between Islamic scholars on whether female eyewitnesses are acceptable witnesses in cases of zina (for other crimes, sharia considers two female witnesses equal the witness of one male).\n\nZina is a Hudud crime, stated in multiple sahih hadiths to deserve the stoning (Rajm) punishment. In others stoning is prescribed as punishment for illegal sex between man and woman, In some sunnah, the method of stoning, by first digging a pit and partly burying the person's lower half in it, is described. Based on these hadiths, in some Muslim countries, married adulterers are sentenced to death, while consensual sex between unmarried people is sentenced with flogging a 100 times. Adultery can be punished by up to one hundred lashes, though this is not binding in nature and the final decision will always be in the hands of a judge appointed by the state or community. However, no mention of stoning or capital punishment for adultery is found in the Quran and only mentioning lashing as punishment for adultery. Nevertheless, most scholars maintain that there is sufficient evidence from hadiths to derive a ruling.\n\nSharia law makes a distinction between adultery and rape and applies different rules. In the case of rape, the adult male perpetrator (i.e. rapist) of such an act is to receive the ḥadd zinā, but the non-consenting or invalidly consenting female (i.e. rape victim), proved by four eyewitnesses, is to be regarded as innocent of zinā and relieved of the ḥadd punishment. Confession and four witness-based prosecutions of zina are rare. Most cases of prosecutions are when the woman becomes pregnant, or when she has been raped, seeks justice and the sharia authorities charge her for zina, instead of duly investigating the rapist. Some fiqhs (schools of Islamic jurisprudence) created the principle of \"shubha\" (doubt), wherein there would be no zina charges if a Muslim man claims he believed he was having sex with a woman he was married to or with a woman he owned as a slave.\n\nZina only applies for unlawful sex between free Muslims; the rape of a non-Muslim slave woman is not zina as the act is considered an offense not against the raped slave woman, but against the owner of the slave.\n\nThe zina and rape laws of countries under Sharia law are the subjects of a global human rights debate and one of many items of reform and secularization debate with respect to Islam. Contemporary human right activists refer this as a new phase in the politics of gender in Islam, the battle between forces of traditionalism and modernism in the Muslim world, and the use of religious texts of Islam through state laws to sanction and practice gender-based violence.\n\nIn contrast to human rights activists, Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider 'universal human rights' arguments as imposition of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and sexual codes that are central to Islam. Zina laws come under hudud—seen as crime against Allah; the Islamists refer to this pressure and proposals to reform zina and other laws as ‘contrary to Islam’. Attempts by international human rights to reform religious laws and codes of Islam has become the Islamist rallying platforms during political campaigns.\n\nThe Quran contains seven references to fate of \"the people of Lut\", and their destruction is associated explicitly with their sexual practices:\nGiven that the Quran is allegedly vague regarding the punishment of homosexual sodomy, Islamic jurists, turned to the collections of the hadith and seerah (accounts of Muhammad's life) to support their argument for Hudud punishment. There were varying opinions on how the death penalty was to be carried out. Abu Bakr apparently recommended toppling a wall on the evil-doer, or else burning alive, while Ali bin Abi Talib ordered death by stoning for one \"luti\" and had another thrown head-first from the top of a minaret—according to Ibn Abbas, this last punishment must be followed by stoning. With few exceptions all scholars of Sharia, or Islamic law, interpret homosexual activity as a punishable offence as well as a sin. There is no specific punishment prescribed, however, and this is usually left to the discretion of the local authorities on Islam. There are several methods by which sharia jurists have advocated the punishment of gays or lesbians who are sexually active. One form of execution involves an individual convicted of homosexual acts being stoned to death by a crowd of Muslims. Other Muslim jurists have established ijma ruling that those committing homosexual acts be thrown from rooftops or high places, and this is the perspective of most Salafists.\n\nToday in most of the Islamic world homosexuality is not socially or legally accepted. In Afghanistan, Brunei, Gaza Strip, Iran, Mauritania, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, United Arab Emirates and Yemen, homosexual activity carries the death penalty. In others, such as Algeria, Maldives, Malaysia, Pakistan, Qatar, Somalia and Syria, it is illegal.\n\nSame-sex sexual intercourse is legal in 20 Muslim-majority nations (Albania, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Guinea-Bissau, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Mali, Niger, Tajikistan, Turkey, West Bank (State of Palestine), and most of Indonesia (except in Aceh and South Sumatra provinces, where bylaws against LGBT rights have been passed), as well as Northern Cyprus). In Albania, Lebanon, and Turkey, there have been discussions about legalizing same-sex marriage. Homosexual relations between females are legal in Kuwait, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, but homosexual acts between males are illegal.\n\nMost Muslim-majority countries and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) have opposed moves to advance LGBT rights at the United Nations, in the General Assembly and/or the UNHRC. In May 2016, a group of 51 Muslim states blocked 11 gay and transgender organizations from attending a high-level meeting at the United Nations on ending AIDS. However, Albania, Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone have signed a UN Declaration supporting LGBT rights. Kosovo as well as the (internationally not recognized) Muslim-majority Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus also have anti-discrimination laws in place.\n\nIn June 12, 2016, at least 49 people were killed and 50 injured in a mass shooting at Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in the second deadliest mass shooting by an individual and the deadliest incident of violence against LGBT people in U.S. history. The shooter, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to ISIL. The act has been described by investigators as an Islamic terrorist attack and a hate crime, despite the revelation that he was suffering from mental health issues and acted alone. Upon further review, investigators indicated Omar Mateen showed few signs of radicalization, suggesting that the shooter's pledge to ISIL may have been a calculated move to garner more news coverage. Afghanistan, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Turkmenistan and United Arab Emirates condemned the attack. Many American Muslims, including community leaders, swiftly condemned the attack. Prayer vigils for the victims were held at mosques across the country. The Florida mosque where Mateen sometimes prayed issued a statement condemning the attack and offering condolences to the victims. The Council on American–Islamic Relations called the attack \"monstrous\" and offered its condolences to the victims. CAIR Florida urged Muslims to donate blood and contribute funds in support of the victims' families.\n\nWhile some authors, such as Phyllis Chesler, argue that Islam is connected to violence against women, especially in the form of honor killings, others, such as Tahira Shahid Khan, a professor specializing in women's issues at the Aga Khan University in Pakistan, argue that it is the domination of men and inferior status of women in society that lead to these acts, not the religion itself. Public (such as through the media) and political discourse debating the relation between Islam, immigration, and violence against women is highly controversial in many Western countries.\n\nMany scholars claim Shari'a law encourages domestic violence against women, when a husband suspects \"nushuz\" (disobedience, disloyalty, rebellion, ill conduct) in his wife. Other scholars claim wife beating, for \"nashizah\", is not consistent with modern perspectives of Qur'an. Some conservative translations find that Muslim husbands are permitted to act what is known in Arabic as Idribuhunna with the use of \"light force,\" and sometimes as much as to strike, hit, chastise, or beat.\n\nOther interpretations of the verse claim it does not support hitting a woman, but separating from her. Variations in interpretation are due to different schools of Islamic jurisprudence, histories and politics of religious institutions, conversions, reforms, and education.\n\nAlthough Islam permits women to divorce for domestic violence, they are subject to the laws of their nation which might make it quite difficult for a woman to obtain a divorce. In deference to Surah 4:34, many nations with Shari'a law have refused to consider or prosecute cases of domestic abuse.\n\nIslamic terrorism is, by definition, terrorist acts committed by Muslim groups or individuals who profess Islamic or Islamist motivations or goals. Islamic terrorists have relied on particular interpretations of the tenets of the Quran and the Hadith, citing these scriptures to justify violent tactics including mass murder, genocide, child-molestation and slavery. In recent decades, incidents of Islamic terrorism have occurred on a global scale, occurring not only in Muslim-majority states in Africa and Asia, but also abroad in Europe, Russia, and the United States, and such attacks have targeted Muslims and non-Muslims. In a number of the worst-affected Muslim-majority regions, these terrorists have been met by armed, independent resistance groups, state actors and their proxies, and politically liberal Muslim protesters.\n\nIslam does not have any normative tradition of pacifism, and warfare has been integral part of Islamic history both for the defense and the spread of the faith since the time of Muhammad. Prior to the Hijra travel Muhammad struggled non-violently against his opposition in Mecca. It was not until after the exile that the Quranic revelations began to adopt a more violent perspective. Fighting in self-defense is not only legitimate but considered obligatory upon Muslims, according to the Qur'an. The Qur'an, however, says that should the enemy's hostile behavior cease, then the reason for engaging the enemy also lapses.\nHowever, different Muslim movements through history had linked pacifism with Muslim theology.\n\nPhilip W. Sutton and Stephen Vertigans describe Western views on Islam as based on a stereotype of it as an inherently violent religion, characterizing it as a 'religion of the sword'. They characterize the image of Islam in the Western world as \"dominated by conflict, aggression, 'fundamentalism', and global-scale violent terrorism.\"\n\nJuan Eduardo Campo writes that, \"Europeans (have) viewed Islam in various ways: sometimes as a backward, violent religion; sometimes as an Arabian Nights fantasy; and sometimes as a complex and changing product of history and social life.\" Robert Gleave writes that, \"at the centre of popular conceptions of Islam as a violent religion are the punishments carried out by regimes hoping to bolster both their domestic and international Islamic credentials.\"\n\nThe 9/11 attack on the US has led many non-Muslims to indict Islam as a violent religion. According to Corrigan and Hudson, \"some conservative Christian leaders (have) complained that Islam (is) incompatible with what they believed to be a Christian America.\" Examples of evangelical Christians who have expressed such sentiments include Franklin Graham, an American Christian evangelist and missionary, and Pat Robertson, an American media mogul, executive chairman, and a former Southern Baptist minister. According to a survey conducted by LifeWay Research, a research group affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, said that two out of three Protestant pastors believe that Islam is a \"dangerous\" religion. Ed Stetzer, President of LifeWay, said \"It's important to note our survey asked whether pastors viewed Islam as 'dangerous,' but that does not necessarily mean 'violent.\" \nDr. Johannes J.G. Jansen was an Arabist who wrote an essay called “Religious Roots of Muslim Violence”, in which he discusses at length all aspects of the issue and unequivocally concludes that Muslim violence is mostly based on Islamic religious commands.\n\nMedia coverage on terrorist attacks play a critical role in creating negative perceptions on Islam and Muslims. Powell described how Islam initially appeared in U.S. news cycles because of its relationships to oil, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and terrorism (92). Thus the audience was provided the base to associate Muslims to control of the resource of oil, war, and terrorism. A total of 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. soil since the 9/11 and their content coverage (in 1,638 news stories) in the national media had been analyzed \"through frames composed of labels, common themes, and rhetorical associations\" (Powell 94). The key findings are summarized below: \n\nIslamophobia denotes the prejudice against, hatred towards, or fear of the religion of Islam or Muslims. While the term is now widely used, both the term itself and the underlying concept of Islamophobia have been heavily criticized. In order to differentiate between prejudiced views of Islam and secularly motivated criticism of Islam other terms have been proposed. The causes and characteristics of Islamophobia are still debated. Some commentators have posited an increase in Islamophobia resulting from the September 11 attacks, while others have associated it with the increased presence of Muslims in the United States, the European Union and other secular nations. Steven Salaita contends that indeed since 9/11, Arab Americans have evolved from what Nadine Naber described as an invisible group in the United States into a highly visible community that directly or indirectly has an effect on the United States' culture wars, foreign policy, presidential elections and legislative tradition.\n\nIn response to these perceptions, Ram Puniyani, a secular activist and writer, says that \"Islam does not condone violence but, like other religions, does believe in self-defence\".\n\nMark Juergensmeyer describes the teachings of Islam as ambiguous about violence. He states that, like all religions, Islam occasionally allows for force while stressing that the main spiritual goal is one of nonviolence and peace. Ralph W. Hood, Peter C. Hill and Bernard Spilka write in \"The Psychology of Religion: An Empirical Approach\", \"Although it would be a mistake to think that Islam is inherently a violent religion, it would be equally inappropriate to fail to understand the conditions under which believers might feel justified in acting violently against those whom their tradition feels should be opposed.\"\n\nSimilarly, Chandra Muzaffar, a political scientist, Islamic reformist and activist, says, \"The Quranic exposition on resisting aggression, oppression and injustice lays down the parameters within which fighting or the use of violence is legitimate. What this means is that one can use the Quran as the criterion for when violence is legitimate and when it is not.\"\n\nPew research in 2010 found that in Jordan, Lebanon, and Nigeria, roughly 50% of Muslims had favourable views of Hezbollah, and that Hamas also saw similar support. Counter-terrorism researchers suggests that support for suicide bombings is rooted in opposition to real or perceived foreign military occupation, rather than Islam, according to a Department of Defense-funded study by University of Chicago researcher Robert Pape.\n\nWriting for the National Post, Barbara Kay stated that honor killing is not strictly a Muslim phenomenon and that it is enabled by factors including sexism, dowries and a lack of a dependable legal system. Nevertheless, Kay says that the murders are a Muslim phenomenon in the West, where 95% of honor killings are perpetrated by \"Muslim fathers and brothers or their proxies\". Kay warns that females do not dissent as one might expect either: The women may describe victims of honor killing as having needed punishment.\n\nThe Pew Research Center also found that support for the death penalty as punishment for \"people who leave the Muslim religion\" was 86% in Jordan, 84% in Egypt, 76% in Pakistan, 80% in Nigeria (all very large Muslim populations) and yet lower in some other countries. The different factors at play (e.g. sectarianism, poverty, etc.) and their relative impacts are not clarified.\n\nAccording to 2006 data, Pew says that 46% of Nigerian Muslims, 29% of Jordan Muslims, 28% of Egyptian Muslims, 15% of British Muslims, and 8% of American Muslims thought suicide bombings are often or sometimes justified. The figure was unchanged – still 8% – for American Muslims by 2011.\n\nPolls have found Muslim-Americans to report less violent views than any other religious group in America. 89% of Muslim-Americans claimed that the killing of civilians is never justified, compared to 71% of Catholics and Protestants, 75% of Jews, and 76% of atheists and non-religious groups.\n\nThe Pew Research Center's 2013 poll showed that the majority of 14,244 Muslim, Christian and other respondents in 14 countries with substantial Muslim populations are concerned about Islamic extremism and hold negative views on known terrorist groups.\n\nGallup poll collected extensive data in a project called \"Who Speaks for Islam?\". John Esposito and Dalia Mogahed present data relevant to Islamic views on peace, and more, in their book \"Who Speaks for Islam?\" The book reports Gallup poll data from random samples in over 35 countries using Gallup's various research techniques (e.g. pairing male and female interviewers, testing the questions beforehand, communicating with local leaders when approval is necessary, travelling by foot if that is the only way to reach a region, etc.) \n\nThere was a great deal of data. It suggests, firstly, that individuals who dislike America and consider the September 11 attacks to be \"perfectly justified\" form a statistically distinct group, with much more extreme views. The authors call this 7% of Muslims \"Politically Radicalized\". They chose that title \"because of their radical political orientation\" and clarify \"we are not saying that all in this group commit acts of violence. However, those with extremist views are a potential source for recruitment or support for terrorist groups.\" The data also indicates that poverty is not simply to blame for the comparatively radical views of this 7% of Muslims, who tend to be better educated than moderates.\n\nThe authors say that, contrary to what the media may indicate, most Muslims believe that the September 11 attacks cannot actually be justified at all. The authors called this 55% of Muslims \"Moderates\". Included in that category were an additional 12% who said the attacks \"almost\" cannot be justified at all (thus 67% of Muslims were classified as Moderates). 26% of Muslims were neither moderates nor radicals, leaving the remaining 7% called \"Politically Radicalized\". Esposito and Mogahed explain that the labels should not be taken as being perfectly definitive. Because there may be individuals who would generally not be considered radical, although they believe the attacks were justified, or vice versa.\n\n"}

{"id": "455547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=455547", "title": "Literary genre", "text": "Literary genre\n\nA literary genre is a category of literary composition. Genres may be determined by literary technique, tone, content, or even (as in the case of fiction) length. The distinctions between genres and categories are flexible and loosely defined, often with subgroups.\n\nThe most general genres in literature are (in loose chronological order) epic, tragedy, comedy, and creative nonfiction. They can all be in the form of prose or poetry. Additionally, a genre such as satire, allegory or pastoral might appear in any of the above, not only as a subgenre (see below), but as a mixture of genres. Finally, they are defined by the general cultural movement of the historical period in which they were composed.\n\nGenre should not be confused with age categories, by which literature may be classified as either adult, young adult, or children's. They are also not the same as format, such as graphic novel or picture book.\n\nJust as there are different types of painting: landscape, still life, portrait; there are different types of literary works. These types tend to share specific characteristics. Genres describe those works which share specific conventions.\n\nGenres are often divided into subgenres. Literature is divided into the classic three forms of Ancient Greece, poetry, drama, and prose. Poetry may then be subdivided into the genres of lyric, epic, and dramatic. The lyric includes all the shorter forms of poetry, e.g., song, ode, ballad, elegy, sonnet. Dramatic poetry might include comedy, tragedy, melodrama, and mixtures like tragicomedy.\n\nThe standard division of drama into tragedy and comedy derives from Greek drama. This parsing into subgenres can continue: \"comedy\" has its own subgenres, including, for example, comedy of manners, sentimental comedy, burlesque comedy, and satirical comedy.\n\nOften, the criteria used to divide up works into genres are not consistent, and may change constantly, and be subject of argument, change and challenge by both authors and critics. However, even a very loose term like fiction (\"literature created from the imagination, not presented as fact, though it may be based on a true story or situation\") is not universally applied to all fictitious literature, but instead is typically restricted to the use for novel, short story, and novella, but not fables, and is also usually a prose text. Types of fiction genres are science fiction and fantasy, historical fiction, realistic fiction and mysteries.\n\nSemi-fiction spans stories that include a substantial amount of non-fiction. It may be the retelling of a true story with only the names changed. The other way around, semi-fiction may also involve fictional events with a semi-fictional character, such as Jerry Seinfeld.\n\nGenres may easily be confused with literary techniques, but, though only loosely defined, they are not the same; examples are parody, frame story, constrained writing, stream of consciousness.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film's title translates to \"Lottery winner UKK Turhapuro\", UKK being an apparent reference to former President of Finland Urho Kekkonen.\n\nIt is the first anniversary of Uuno (Vesa-Matti Loiri) and Elisabet (Marjatta Raita). Uuno has placed a bet with his friend Härski-Hartikainen (Spede Pasanen) a year ago, that if Uuno can take just one year of marriage with Elisabet, Hartikainen will treat him a festive dinner. However, Hartikainen buys a lottery ticket for Uuno, who agrees to deduct it from his debt – and the festive dinner is reduced to a can of milk and half a sausage. As it happens, Uuno becomes the lottery winner of 1.5 million marks, only to soon realize he doesn't own a single penny yet. Mister Tossavainen (Seppo Laine) arrives and offers to finance Uuno before he actually gets the jackpot. Thus, Uuno gets to live a rich live on credit. He buys a raccoon fur, leopard swimming trunks and a couple of Mercedes-Benzes. Women begin to fancy Uuno and so does his father-in-law (Tapio Hämäläinen). As time goes by it is revealed, though, that Uuno is not actually a lottery winner, and so he has to escape the anger of others to Härski's car repair shop.\n"}

It is principally a Russian phenomenon. \n\nOrange Alternative (Polish: \"Pomarańczowa Alternatywa\") was a Polish anti-communist underground movement, started in Wrocław, a city in south-west Poland, in the 1980s. Its main purpose was to offer a wider group of citizens an alternative way of opposition against the authoritarian regime by means of peaceful street protests that used absurd and nonsensical elements.\n\nIn 2004, Artyom Loskutov and members of the \"Contemporary Art Terrorism\" group in Novosibirsk joined the annual May Day demonstration. They were carrying posters with deliberately absurd slogans in an attempt to shake up a boring political procession and to make fun. \nFellow Siberian artist Ivan Dyrkin named the march \"Monstration,\" a demonstration without the prefix \"de,\" which he considered a negative connotation as in deconstruction or degradation.\n\nThe modern monstration incorporates signs and messages that are deliberately absurd, nonsensical and apolitical that indirectly defy the government and express a conceptual paradox. Although monstrations are apolitical, participants have been arrested for political agitation. In 2010, Monstrations took place in 20 cities like Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Vladivostok.\n\nThe first monstration in Kursk took place on May 1, 2014.\nAbout 30 people with the main slogan \"For the rights of butterflies in the stomach\". \n\nIn 2015, the main slogan was \"We did not watch 50 Shades\".\n\nIn 2011 Monstration was recognized for \"Innovation\" by a government agency of modern art and selected as \"Best in the Region.\"\n\nIn 2014, Artyom Loskutov attempted to organize a routine monstration for August 17, when he ran into trouble. “We were talking about having a march, which is absolutely allowed under law,” Loskutov says. “But in writing about it, we wrote about creating a Siberian Republic within the Russian Federation. There was no talk about separatism or anything, it’s just that Moscow doesn’t govern the regions very effectively.” \n\nThe purpose of the protest was to ridicule Kremlin's hypocrisy in the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and to raise awareness about politics in Siberia. \"They decided to tell us how great it is when some republic moves for self-determination. Okay, well let's apply this to other regions. Can Siberia allow itself this same rhetoric? It turns out it can't.\"\n\nRussian telecommunications regulator Roskomnadzor launched a media blackout of the event, issued warnings to 14 media outlets that ran the story and threatened to close BBC Russian Service for reporting the announcement. Roskomnadzor also launched an official investigation against BBC to confirm \"an apparent violation of the law.\" In response, BBC added a description of the event as a “parody” that in no way promoted Siberia's independence from Moscow.\n\nRussian authorities compared the potential monstration protest to Euromaidan that led to the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. Nikolai Valuyev called it the \"first attempt of global efforts to promote separatism in Russia.\"\n\nAccording to Dmitry Zhuravlyov, director of Institute for Regional Problems based in Moscow, \"I can understand the position of these people [organizers of the march] on a psychological level,\" Zhuravlyov said. \"They want to have more control over the riches of Siberia, and that is understandable. But what is unacceptable to Russia is that this whole idea goes against the Constitution. You cannot change the status of your region just like that.\" President Vladimir Putin recently signed legislation that introduced prison sentences for violations of territorial integrity in Russia.\n\n\n"}

They are often off-metal strike, to proof standard or piedforts. They are collected or studied by many coin collectors because of their historical importance. A high number of the world's most valuable coins are patterns, and nearly a quarter of the pieces listed in \"100 Greatest US Coins\" are pattern coins. \n\nThe first English coin that can be identified with certainty is a groat, originally worth fourpence. This piece, an example of which was illustrated and sold in the Dodsley Cuff sale of the mid-19th century, had crowns in place of the usual three pellets in each quarter of the reverse.\n\nPatterns are particularly identifiable and exist in larger numbers from the reign of Elizabeth I onwards. The experimental base metal issues of all coinage prior to the mid-18th century have been well preserved.\n\nBoulton's mint in Soho produced large quantities of patterns, which were supplemented by Taylor some fifty or so years later from the same dies.\n\nAfter the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776, discussion arose over what sort of currency should be adopted in the United States. At the time, people in North America relied upon a mixture of foreign coins, none of which were struck to a consistent standard, making day to day financial transactions difficult. In 1783, Congress resolved to create a mint, tasking Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris with developing a plan for a system of coinage. The first coins struck by the United States – the Nova Constellatio patterns – were made to illustrate this plan.\n\nIn 1792 the United States Mint opened in Philadelphia. In that year several more patterns were created, including the half dime, then known as a \"half disme\". It is believed that 1,500 pieces were struck as patterns, and that these patterns themselves entered circulation during the next decade.\n\nOver the next 40 years, more patterns were created but there is little information currently known about these pieces. Technically, these coins were not patterns but rather off-metal strikes, with the coins struck in a different metal than those destined for general use in circulation. An example is an 1807 Half Eagle, or five dollar gold piece struck in copper.\n\nStarting in 1836, more patterns were created by the United States Mint in Philadelphia. These consisted of several types of patterns:\n\nOne example of a pattern coin for proposed coinage is the half-union, a gold pattern coin with a face value of 50 U.S. dollars that was minted in 1877 and weighed . The U.S. Mint deemed the idea of a 2.5-ounce gold coin infeasible, and only two were ever minted.\n\nTransitional pieces are patterns dated before coins with the new design officially went into circulation. These were often produced during final stage of the pattern process, used to present the newly adopted design to the public. One famous example is the 1856 Flying Eagle cent, although that coin has been commonly and incorrectly believed to be regular issue due to its high mintage for collectors.\n\nFantasy pieces include many struck in the 1860s and 1870s as patterns and sold to numismatists for the sole purpose of raising cash for the mint. This practice ended in the 1880s, when the U.S. Mint enforced regulations to prevent the sale of pattern coins.\n\nThe U.S. Mint experiments with new coinage occasionally, such as when silver was removed from coin designs. The Mint began using dies with Martha Washington for trial strikings, since they would not be confused with real circulating money since they do not resemble money. Thus, no restrictions exist on the sale of Martha Washington pieces. Mint-produced modern patterns are very rare, with only a few pieces existing in private collections. The United States mint has placed restrictions on the sale of modern patterns that do resemble coins, such as the 1974 aluminum cent. One of the most expansive collections of American pattern coins is the Harry W. Bass, Jr. collection housed at the American Numismatic Association Money Museum in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\nPattern coins of France and of French-speaking countries such as Monaco are described by the French term \"essai\". The essai coins of New Hebrides are of interest to collectors of British Commonwealth coinage, as New Hebrides gained independence in 1980 as the Republic of Vanuatu.\n\nThe word \"essai\" is found inscribed on the pattern coins of Namibia along with the German word \"Probe\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "272323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=272323", "title": "Permutation City", "text": "Permutation City\n\nPermutation City is a 1994 science-fiction novel by Greg Egan that explores many concepts, including quantum ontology, through various philosophical aspects of artificial life and simulated reality. Sections of the story were adapted from Egan's 1992 short story \"Dust\", which dealt with many of the same philosophical themes. \"Permutation City\" won the John W. Campbell Award for the best science-fiction novel of the year in 1995 and was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award the same year. The novel was also cited in a 2003 \"Scientific American\" article on multiverses by Max Tegmark.\n\n\"Permutation City\" asks whether there is a difference between a computer simulation of a person and a \"real\" person. It focuses on a model of consciousness and reality, the \"Dust Theory\", similar to the Ultimate Ensemble Mathematical Universe hypothesis proposed by Max Tegmark. It uses the assumption that human consciousness is Turing-computable: that consciousness can be produced by a computer program. The book deals with consequences of human consciousness being amenable to mathematical manipulation, as well as some consequences of simulated realities. In this way, Egan attempts to deconstruct notions of self, memory, and mortality, and of physical reality.\n\nThe Autoverse is an artificial life simulator based on a cellular automaton complex enough to represent the substratum of an artificial chemistry. It is deterministic, internally consistent and vaguely resembles real chemistry. Tiny environments, simulated in the Autoverse and filled with populations of a simple, designed lifeform, \"Autobacterium lamberti\", are maintained by a community of enthusiasts obsessed with getting \"A. lamberti\" to evolve, something the Autoverse chemistry seems to make extremely difficult.\n\nRelated explorations go on in virtual realities (VR), which make extensive use of patchwork heuristics to crudely simulate immersive and convincing physical environments, albeit at a maximal speed of seventeen times slower than \"real\" time, limited by the optical crystal computing technology used at the time of the story. Larger VR environments, covering a greater internal volume in greater detail, are cost-prohibitive even though VR worlds are computed selectively for inhabitants, reducing redundancy and extraneous objects and places to the minimal details required to provide a convincing experience to those inhabitants; for example, a mirror not being looked at would be reduced to a reflection value, with details being \"filled in\" as necessary if its owner were to turn their model-of-a-head towards it.\n\nWithin the story, \"Copies\" – digital renderings of human brains with complete subjective consciousness, the technical descendants of ever more comprehensive medical simulations – live within VR environments after a process of \"scanning\". Copies are the only objects within VR environments that are simulated in full detail, everything else being produced with varying levels of generalisation, lossy compression, and hashing at all times.\n\nCopies form the conceptual spine of the story, and much of the plot deals directly with the \"lived\" experience of Copies, most of whom are copies of wealthy billionaires suffering terminal illnesses or fatal accidents, who spend their existences in VR worlds of their creating, usually maintained by trust funds, which independently own and operate large computing resources for their sakes, separated physically and economically from most of the rest of the world's computing power, which is privatized as a fungible commodity. Although the wealthiest copies face no financial difficulties, they can still be threatened because copies lack political and legal rights (they are considered software), especially where the global economy is in recession. Hence they cannot afford to retreat into solipsism and ignore what is happening in the real world.\n\nAt the opposite end from the wealthy Copies are those who can only afford to live in the virtual equivalent of \"Slums\", being bounced around the globe to the cheapest physical computing available at any given time in order to save money, while running at much slower speeds compared to the wealthy Copies. Their slowdown rate depends on how much computer power their meager assets can afford, as computer power is traded on a global exchange and goes to the highest bidder at any point in time. When they cannot afford to be \"run\" at all, they can be frozen as a \"snapshot\" until computer power is relatively affordable again. A Copy whose financial assets can only generate sufficient interest to run at a very slow rate is stuck in a rut because he/she/it becomes unemployable and is unable to generate new income, which may lead to a downward spiral.\n\nBy creating this scenario, Egan postulates a world where economic inequality can persist even in one's (virtual) afterlife.\n\nThe concept of solipsism is also examined prominently, with many less-wealthy Copies attending social functions called Slow Clubs, where socialising Copies agree to synchronise with the slowest person present. Many of these less-wealthy Copies become completely deracinated from their former lives and from world events, or else become \"Witnesses\", who spend their time observing (at considerable time lapse) world events unfold, at the cost of any meaningful relationships with their fellow Copies. A subculture of lower/middle-class Copies, calling themselves \"Solipsist Nation\" after a philosophical work by their nominal founder, choose to completely repudiate the \"real\" world and any Copies still attached to it, reprogramming their models-of-brains and their VR environments in order to design themselves into their own personal vision of paradise, of whatever size and detail, disregarding slowdown in the process.\n\nEgan's later novels \"Diaspora\" and \"Schild's Ladder\" deal with related issues from other perspectives.\n\nThe plot of Permutation City follows the lives of several people in a near future reality where the Earth is ravaged by the effects of climate change, the economy and culture are largely globalised, and civilisation has accumulated vast amounts of cloud computing power and memory which is distributed internationally and is traded in a public market called the QIPS Exchange (Quadrillion Instructions Per Second, see MIPS).\n\nMost importantly, this great computing capacity has enabled the creation of Copies, whole brain emulations of \"scanned\" humans which are detailed enough to allow for subjective conscious experience on the part of the emulation. Scanning has become safe enough and common enough to allow for a few wealthy or dedicated humans to afford to create backups of themselves. Copies do not yet possess human rights under the laws of any nation or international body.\n\nIn 2050, Paul Durham, a Sydney man having experimented on Copies of himself, offers wealthy Copies prime real estate in an advanced supercomputer which, according to his pitch, will never be shut down and never experience any slowdown whatsoever. Durham predicts that efforts to utilise chaotic effects will clash with Copy rights, as both Copies and weather simulations will demand increasing QIPS Exchange shares. All that each Copy must do is to make the comparatively small investment of two million ecus in order to bring Durham's fantasy computer into existence.\n\nDurham hires Maria Deluca, an Autoverse enthusiast, to design an Autoverse program which, given a powerful enough computer, could generate a planet's worth of evolvable Autoverse life. He also clandestinely commissions a famous virtual reality architect, Malcolm Carter, to build a full scale VR city; outside of Durham's knowledge, Carter secretly hacks two Slum-dwelling Solipsist Nation Copies (Peer and Kate) into this city's machine code. When Maria learns of a computer fraud investigation on Durham, she confronts him.\n\nDurham reveals that his self-experiments convinced him that there is no difference, even in principle, between physics and mathematics, and that all mathematically possible structures exist, among them our physics and therefore our spacetime, a belief he refers to as \"Dust Theory\". The dust theory implies that all possible universes exist and are equally real, emerging spontaneously from their own mathematical self-consistency. Because Copies exist in virtual realities held together by heuristics merely for the sake of their experience, it should be the case that when a Copy is terminated and deleted, its own conscious experience will continue. Indeed, Durham himself claims to have been through such a process dozens of times.\n\nDurham uses the money from his financial backing to simulate a minute or two of a \"Garden of Eden\" configuration of an infinitely-expanding, massively complex cellular automaton universe, in which each iteration of the expansion serves to \"manufacture\" an extra layer of blocks of a computing configuration. According to his Dust Theory, such a simulation would create a self-consistent \"TVC universe\" to persist in its own terms even after its termination and deletion. His and his investors' Copies would therefore persist indefinitely in the simulation. The Autoverse planetary seed program designed by Maria is included in the TVC universe package for his investors to explore once life had evolved there after it had been run on a significantly large segment of the TVC universe (referred to as \"Planet Lambert\").\n\nAfter a successful launch, simulation, termination, and deletion of the TVC universe, Durham and Maria have uncomfortable sex in awkward celebration, and later that night, while Maria is asleep, Durham disembowels himself with a kitchen knife in his bathtub, believing his role as the springboard for his deleted TVC Copy to discover its true identity to be fulfilled.\n\nMaria wakes in Permutation City seven thousand years of subjective time after the launch, furious at Durham for awakening her. He explains to her that intelligent life has arisen on Planet Lambert in the form of complex swarms of insect-like eusocial beings, evolved from Maria's original \"Autobacterium hydrophilus\". He wishes to use Maria's slice of the universe's processing power (as a founder of the world she was given de facto control of a continuously-growing zone of the processor network as well) to make forbidden first contact with Lambertians. He believes this is necessary because he has lost the ability to pause the Autoverse simulation or slow it down past a constant multiple of the size of the processor network it occupies. Durham is worried that the rules of their simulated universe are breaking down.\n\nThey discover that the combined intelligence of Lambertians has exceeded that of Permutation City; as such, the TVC universe is being overwritten into a system existing solely as a byproduct of the self-perpetuation of the Autoverse. Durham, Maria, and some other companions quickly launch an emergency expedition into the Autoverse to attempt to convince the Lambertians of the validity of the creator hypothesis and its methodological perferentiality over their own newly formulated theory. Unfortunately, the Lambertians reject the creator theory, prompting Permutation City and the entirety of TVC processor-networks to begin collapsing into nothing. Durham and Maria inform the inhabitants of Permutation City, who launch a new TVC Garden of Eden in their universe's final moments. Maria convinces a reluctant Durham to come along to a new universe, pledging to work with her to discover the underlying rules that governed the Autoverse's takeover of Permutation City.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "876849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=876849", "title": "Rocket Festival", "text": "Rocket Festival\n\nA Rocket Festival (, ) is a merit-making ceremony traditionally practiced by ethnic Lao people throughout much of Isan and Laos, in numerous villages and municipalities near the beginning of the wet season. Celebrations typically include preliminary music and dance performances, competitive processions of floats, dancers and musicians on the second day, and culminating on the third day in competitive firings of home-made rockets. Local participants and sponsors use the occasion to enhance their social prestige, as is customary in traditional Buddhist folk festivals throughout Southeast Asia.\n\nFestival period : April - June (various local area ) The Festival most famous and widely know and have special program and specific local pattern of Bung Fai or Parade dance and Beautiful Bung Fai float in Thailand such as Yasothon The second weekend of May, Suwannaphum District, Roi Et The first weekend of June, Phanom Phrai District Roi Et Full moon of seventh month in Lunar year's calendar in each year.\nNot only found Bung Fai festival found in Isan or Northeasthern of Thailand and North of Thailand and Laos only,also has found some people who moved to Amphoe Sukhirin Narathiwat has Bung Fai festival there too.\n\nThese Buddhist festivals are presumed to have evolved from pre-Buddhist fertility rites held to celebrate and encourage the coming of the rains, from before the 9th century invention of black powder. This festival displays some earthy elements of Lao folklore. Coming immediately prior to the planting season, the festivals offer an excellent chance to make merry before the hard work begins, as well as enhancing communal prestige, and attracting and redistributing wealth as in any gift culture.\n\nScholars study the centuries-old rocket festival tradition today as it may be significant to the history of rocketry in the East, and perhaps also significant in the postcolonial socio-political development of the Southeast Asian nation states. Economically, villages and sponsors bear the costs in many locations in Laos and in northern Isan (northeast Thailand). The festivals typically begin at the beginning of the rainy season, in the sixth or seventh lunar months.\n\nAnthropology Professor Charles F. Keyes advises, \"In recognition of the deep-seated meaning of certain traditions for the peoples of the societies of mainland Southeast Asia, the rulers of these societies have incorporated some indigenous symbols into the national cultures that they have worked to construct in the postcolonial period. Giving the \"Bun Bang Fai or fire rocket festival of Laos\" as one example, he adds that it remains \"…far more elaborate in the villages than in the cities….\"\n\nVillages no longer stage \"Bun Bang Fai\" festivals on the scale of Yasothon's famous event. However, villages may have floats conveying government messages. They may also include fairs. In recent years the Tourism Authority of Thailand has helped promote these events, particularly the festivals in the Thai provinces of Nong Khai and Yasothon, the latter boasting the largest and most elaborate of these festivals.The Bun bang fai celebration in the past and up till now are not only in Yasothorn Province, but also in many other provinces around that city such as Roi Et, Kalasin, Srisaket, and Mahasarakham. In Suwannaphum of Roi Et Province is one the most magnificent and beautiful of Thailand's Bang Fai parades that is called \"Bang fai eh\" or \"Bangfai ko\" (Bang Fai Parade are decorated in the form of Thai traditional artwork or Line Thai).\n\nSince the March 1, 1972, separation of Yasothon from Ubon Ratchathani Province, with its world-famous Candle Festival, Yasothon's provincial capital has elaborately staged its now one of three famous Rocket Festival in Thailand ( Yasothon, Suwannaphume, and Phanom Prai both are locate in Roi Et province ) annually over the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday weekend that falls in the middle of May.\n\nRaw Friday (, Wan Sook Dip) features all-night performances of Mor Lam Sing (Thai–Isan: หมอลำซิ่ง), which continue intermittently into the early hours of Monday. Mor Lam Sing is a type of \"morlam\" that is very popular among the local Isan-Lao population. The performance goes on all night and the locals have great fun. Outsiders have a hard time understanding the humour, which is often rather bawdy.\n\nSaturday brings on the competitions for Hae Bangfai Ko (). \n\"Hàe\" are street parades or demonstrations usually featuring traditional dance and accompanying musicians, typically with khaen (), Gongs, Lao-Isan Klong Yao (), \"long drum\"), and an electric guitar, powered by an inverter and car batteries in a handcart that also mounts horn loudspeakers.\nBangfai Ko are richly decorated rockets mounted on traditional but highly decorated oxcarts, or modern floats. Most but not all bold \"Bangfai Ko \" are for show and not actually capable of flight. Many sport the heads of Nāgas; if equipped with water pumps and swivels, they \"are\" actually capable of spitting on spectators.\n\nThe principal theme of any \"Hae Bangfai\" is the Phadaeng and Nang Ai legend (below), so many floats (or highly decorated oxcarts) also depict the couple and their retinue. Other modern themes present as well, as suggested by Keyes (ibid.) Participating groups compete for prizes within their categories. \"Hàe\" typically end in a wat, where dancers and accompanying musicians may further compete in traditional folk dance. All groups prominently display the names of their major sponsors.\n\nRecalling the fertility rite origins of the festival, parade ornaments and floats often sport phallic symbols and imagery.\n\nFestivities also include cross-dressing, both cross-sex and cross-generational, and great quantities of alcohol. Perhaps the most popular beverage, both because it is cheaper than beer and has a higher, 40-percent alcohol content, is a neutral grain spirit called Sura (), but more generally known as \"Lao Whiskey\" (, \"Lao lao\") in Laos and \"Lao Khao\" (, \"white alcohol\") in Thailand. Sato (), a brewed rice beverage similar to Japanese sake, may also be on offer; sweet-flavored \"sato\" may be as little as seven-percent alcohol, but it packs a surprising punch.\n\nSunday competition moves on to the launching of Bangfai, judged, in various categories, for apparent height and distance travelled, with extra points for exceptionally beautiful vapour trails Those whose rockets misfire are either covered with mud, or thrown into a mud puddle (that also serves a safety function, as immediate application of cooling mud can reduce severity of burns). While popular and entertaining, the festival is also dangerous, with participants and spectators alike occasionally being injured or even killed. On 9 May 1999, a \"Lan\" 120 kg rocket exploded 50 metres above ground, just two seconds after launch, killing four persons and wounding 11.\nBang Fai Festival is traditional of Isan and Laotian peoples culture that could be found this festival throughout a country where living place of Isan People. In Roi Et province have two places which widely known and favorite festival in term of the most number of Bang Fai Ei or Bung Fai decorated car in Thailand in Suwannaphume district. In Suwannaphume not only found the number of the most beautiful Bang Fai and the most number of beautiful Bung Fai parade dance by dramatic art collage student but also the only one community that made and Bung Fai decoration by a papers cutting techinque call \"Lai Sri Phume\". In the other hand Roi Et province is well known for Isan peoples which the most favorite in term of originally of local culture with preserve traditional pattern of Bang Fai Festival and the most number of Rocket or Bang Fai in the world in Phanom Prai both are locate in Roi Et province. Today the beautiful Bung Fai float car which show in Yasothon Bang Fai Festival 8 in 9 float cars are made in Roi Et province ( At Samat District, Selaphume District, Thawat Buri District, et al.) and them rent form Roi Et more than 40 years ago.\n\n\"Jaruat\" () is the proper term for rockets used as missiles or weapons, but Bang Fai () skyrockets are gigantic black-powder bottle rockets. Tiny bottle rockets are so-called because they may be launched from a bottle. In the case of the similar appearing \"Bang Fai\", also spelled 'Bong Fai' (), the 'bottle' is a \"bong\" (), a section of bamboo Culm used as a container or pipe (and only colloquially as a pipe for smoking marijuana.)\n\nRelated to the Chinese Fire Arrow, Bang Fai are made from bamboo bongs. Most contemporary ones, however, are enclosed in pvc piping, making them less dangerous by standardizing their sizes and black-powder charges (which contest rules require be compounded by the rocketeers, themselves). Baking or boiling a bong kills insect eggs that otherwise hatch in dead bamboo and eat it, inside out. Skipping this step may cause the bong to disintegrate and melt the PVC piping. Vines tie long bamboo tails to launching racks. The time it takes for the exhaust to burn through the vines (usually) allows a motor to build up to full thrust; then the tails impart in-flight stability. Ignition comes from a burning fuse or electric match.\n\nBang Fai come in various sizes, competing in several categories. Small ones are called Bang Fai Noi (). Larger categories are designated by the counting words for 10,000, 100,000 and 1,000,000: \"Meun\" () \"Saen\" () and the largest Bang Fai, the \"Lan\" (). These counting words see use in many contexts to indicate increasing size or value. \"Lan\" in this context may be taken to mean \"extremely large\" as well as extremely expensive and extremely dangerous: \"Bang Fai Lan\" are nine metres long and charged with 120 kg of black powder. These may reach altitudes reckoned in kilometres, and travel dozens of kilometres down range (loosely speaking, as they can go in any direction, including right through the crowd). Competing rockets are scored for apparent height, distance, and beauty of the vapour trail (). A few include skyrocket pyrotechnics. A few also include parachutes for tail assemblies, but most fall where they may.\n\nNang Ai (), in full, Nang Ai Kham () is queen of the pageant and Phadaeng () is her champion. She is famed as the most beautiful girl. He, an outsider, comes to see for himself, lavishes her with gifts and wins her heart; but must win a rocket festival tournament to win her hand. Unwittingly, he becomes part of a love triangle.\nPhangkhi () and Nang Ai have been fated by their Karma ( ) to have been reborn throughout many past existences as soul mates ( , Lao-Isan .) Stories about the couple, however, say they have not exactly been lovers: in many a past existence, she has been a dutiful wife, but would not yield an inch in an argument to anyone ( ) and he only wanted to satisfy himself ( ). She becomes fed up and prays never to be paired with him, ever again. Nang Ai is reborn as the daughter of \"Phraya Khom\" (, (which means Lord Khmer; but even if her father was a Cambodian overlord, \"Nang Ai Kham\" is still the genuine article), while Phangki is reborn as the son of Phaya Nak, the Grand Nāga who rules the Deeps. (He is depicted in parades in the guise of a prince, riding alone, dogging the new pair.) Phangki isn't invited to the tournament, and Phadaeng's rocket fizzles. Nang Ai's uncle is the winner, so her father calls the whole thing off, which is considered to be a very bad omen, indeed. Pangkhii shape-shifts into a white squirrel to spy on Nang Ai, but she espies him and has him killed by a royal hunter. Pangkhii's flesh magically transforms into meat equal to 8,000 cartloads. Nang Ai and many of her countrymen ate of this tainted flesh, and Phaya Nak vows to allow no one to remain living who had eaten of the flesh of his son. Aroused from the Deeps, he and his watery myrmidons rise and turn the land into a vast swamp. Nagas personify waters running both above and below ground, and nagas run amok are rivers in spate: all Isan is flooded. \nPhadaeng flees the rising flood with Nang Ai on his white stallion, \"Bak Sam\" (), but she is swept off by a Naga's tail, not to be seen again. (Bak Sam is seen in parades sporting his stallion's equipage ( ) that legend says dug a lick called \"Lam Huay Sam\" (, which may be seen to this day in Ban Sammo-Nonthan, Tambon Pho Chai, Amphoe Khok Pho Chai. The legend also tells that receding waters left behind the Nong Han Kumphawapi Lake of the Kumphawapi District marsh, which, too, may be seen to this very day.) Phadaeng escapes, but pines away for his lost love. His ghost then raises an army of the spirits of the air to wage war on the nagas below. The war continues until both sides are exhausted, and the dispute is submitted to King Wetsawan (), king of the North, for arbitration. His decision: the cause of the feud has long since been forgotten and all disputants must let bygones be bygone.\n\nThe legend is retold in many regional variations, all of which are equally true for they relate events in different existences. One 3000-word poem translated to English from this rich Thai-Isan tradition, \"…is especially well known to the Thai audience, having been designated as secondary school supplementary reading by the Thai Ministry of Education, with publication in 1978. There is even a Thai popular song about the leading characters.\" The original was written in a Lao-Isan verse called Khong saan, replete with sexual innuendo, puns, and double entendre.\n\nKeyes (op. cit., p. 67, citing George Coedès) p. 48, says \"Phra Daeng Nang Ai\" is a version of the Kaundinya, legendary founder of Funan; and Soma, the daughter of the king of the Nāga. Keyes also wrote that such legends may prove a valuable source of toponyms.\n\n Almost everyone, native and visitor alike, will say Bang Fai are launched to bring rain, as in the Tourism Authority of Thailand link, below. However, a careful reading of the underlying myth, as presented in Yasothon and Nong Khai, implies the opposite: the rains bring on the rockets. Their version of the myth:\n\nWhen the Lord Buddha was in his bodhisatta (Pali) (Thai: โพธิสัตว์, \"phothisat\") incarnation as King of the Toads Phaya Khang Khok (), and married to Udon Khuruthawip (, Northern Partner-Knowing-Continent), his sermons drew everyone, creatures and sky-dwellers alike, away from Phaya Thaen (), King of the Sky). Angry Phaya Thaen withheld life-giving rains from the earth for seven years, seven months and seven days. Acting against the advice of the Toad King, Phaya Naga (), King of the Nāga (and personification of the Mekong) declared war on Phaya Thaen—and lost.\n\nPersuaded by Phaya Naga to assume command, King Toad enlisted the aid of termites to build mounds reaching to the heavens, and of venomous scorpions and centipedes to attack Phaya Thaen's feet, and of hornets for air support. Previous attempts at aerial warfare against Phaya Thaen in his own element had proved futile; but even the Sky must come down to the ground. On the ground the war was won, and Phaya Thaen sued for peace.\n\nNaga Rockets fired in the air at the end of the hot, dry season are not to threaten Phaya Thaen, but to serve as a reminder to him of his treaty obligations made to Lord Bodhisatta Phaya Khang Khok, King of the Toads, down on the ground. For his part Phaya Nak was rewarded by being given the duty of Honor Guard at most Thai and Lao temples.\n\nAfter the harvest of the resulting crops, Wow thanoo (, bow kite), man-sized kites with a strung bow, are staked out in winter monsoon winds. They are also called Túi-tiù (, singing kite), from the sound of the bowstring singing in the wind, which sing all through the night, to signal Phaya Thaen that he has sent enough rain.\n\nAll participants (including a wow thanoo) were depicted on murals on the front of the former Yasothon Municipal Bang Fai Museum, but were removed when it was remodelled as a learning centre.\n\nAn English-language translation of a Thai report on \"Bang Fai Phaya Nark Naga fireballs\" at Nong Khai gives essentially the same myth (without the hornets and wow) from Thai folk: The knowledge of Thai life-style .\nFor an alternate English-language version, see Tossa, Wajuppa and Phra 'Ariyānuwat ; \"Phya Khankhaak, the Toad King: A Translation of an Isan Fertility Myth in Verse\"; Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press London ; Cranbury, NJ : Associated University Presses ©1996 .\n\n\nThe 2006 Thai martial arts film, \"Kon Fai Bin\", depicts the Rocket Festival. Set in 1890s Siam, the movie's hero, Jone Bang Fai (\"Fireball Bandit\"), is an expert at building the traditional bamboo rockets, which he uses in conjunction with Muay Thai martial arts to defeat his opponents.\n\nThai political protests in April 2010 similarly had Red Shirts firing in downtown Bangkok.\n\n\n\nA video and a brief description about the Rocket Festival in Northeast Thailand (Issan, Esarn) can be seen from http://www.spatz-darmstadt.de (section \"Asian Cultures\" / \"Ethnographic Videos\" / \"Thai,Lao Cultural Festivals\"\n"}
{"id": "46924889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46924889", "title": "Skintern", "text": "Skintern\n\nIn American workplaces, \"skintern\" is an informal term for a summer intern, usually female, who dresses in clothing more revealing than that which is common for the field in question.\n\nThe term is a portmanteau of \"skin\" and \"intern\". It was first widely used about such interns working in offices of members of the U.S. House of Representatives in Washington, D.C. around the mid-2000s; Julia Allison claims it was used in that sense as early as 2000. Since then it has spread to other industries outside government and politics that also employ summer interns.\n\nThe phenomenon is sometimes a deliberate sartorial strategy, but more often is believed to result from ignorance of accepted professional dress standards. Older women in the offices where those interns work have often responded by advising them on how to dress more appropriately. Some feminists, however, have seen the term as yet another symptom of inherent sexism in the workplace, since it is so widely applied.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Washington-area media began reporting that the congressional staffers who manage the intern programs in the United States House of Representatives complained that while most of the young women showed up for work in the same conservative professional attire that the staffers and members did, some chose more revealing clothing. Chad Pegram, a coordinator of Miami University's intern program, recalls that when he took a group to lunch with one member of the state's congressional delegation, one young woman stood out by wearing \"a skirt that was way too short\" and flip-flops. \"It reflected badly on her because everyone else looked great,\" he recalled. \"She embarrassed herself.\"\n\nOther staffers, many of whom themselves began their careers as interns, reported later that they had seen young women come in for internships wearing \"gold stiletto heels, thigh-high boots [and] belly shirts\" in addition to short skirts. Most male staffers did not mind, but female staffers, even those just a few years older, were often resentful and offended. The scandal in which White House intern Monica Lewinsky's sexual affair with President Bill Clinton had led to his impeachment was fresh in institutional memory, and some staffers and journalists wondered if the skimpily dressed young female interns were trying to emulate her. In 2004, Jessica Cutler, a staffer for Ohio Senator Mike DeWine, wrote for a while a blog in which she detailed an active sex life with a variety of men she met through her work, which did little to dispel that idea.\n\nIn June 2005, as another group of summer interns began their weeks on Capitol Hill, Betsy Rothstein wrote an article about the phenomenon for \"The Hill\". \"We were talking about this at dinner the other night, about how some interns show up in some of the skimpiest clothing,\" she quoted an unnamed female press secretary as recalling. \"One of the boys called them skinterns, which I thought was hilarious.\"\n\nAnother term came from an unidentified \"female Republican aide,\" who claimed she kept and shared a list of \"daily offenses\" such as young women wearing metallic shoes and handbags as well as wifebeaters. \"If you are going to wear stilettos or heels, no complaining about how they hurt. Interns need to learn to walk in them.\" She continued \"My favorite term is the Saturday-night intern, one who always dresses like it is a Saturday night. They are all over.\"\n\nWhen the \"Washington Times\" covered the phenomenon a year later, it used the shorter term. \"They'’re known as 'skinterns,'\" the paper wrote. \"Those who think 'belly shirts' are career wear. If the devil wears Prada, the skinterns wear nada. As if Washington wasn't sweltering enough.\" It reported that the popular political blog Wonkette had started a \"Hill Intern Hotties Contest\" for both male and female interns. The article implied that the phenomenon was no longer restricted to just congressional offices but had migrated, like many former members of Congress, to lobbying firms on K Street, where the same standards of dress often obtain.\n\nFour years later, in 2010, \"The Baltimore Sun\" reported that private employers in its coverage area were dealing with skinterns. \"Booty shorts. Thigh-grazing dresses. Flip-flops. Ripped jeans. Cleavage-baring tops. See-through skirts. Forgotten bras. Employers have seen it all—and wish they hadn't.\" Missy Martin, vice president of human resources at Ripken Baseball, told the \"Sun\" that interns were \"showing up to work in bar clothes. Short skirts, tank tops and cleavage showing. It's like, 'Kids, do you realize you're not supposed to be dressed like you're going out to drink in Canton?'\"\n\nBy the middle of the next decade, the skintern phenomenon was no longer limited to Capitol Hill. Articles advising interns on how to dress appeared on popular websites in June, when most internships start. \" ... [B]efore long, the annual summer parade of skinterns will begin,\" wrote Katherine Goldstein, editor of \"Vanity Fair\"s website, dropping the scare quotes in a 2013 \"Slate\" piece advising young women on how to dress in offices. At her former employer, she recalled, \"[e]very June there would be a new batch, just as clueless about appropriate office attire as those from the year before. Think dresses so clingy they leave nothing to the imagination, tops worn without a bra and tied together with string, daisy dukes, sheer harem pants, and cleavage straight out of a men's magazine.\" The following year the \"Kansas City Star\" ran a similar piece.\n\nA 2012 blog post by GlobaLinks Abroad suggested the phenomenon had spread overseas as well. For the organization, Monika Lutz advised young women headed for internships abroad to eschew \"spaghetti straps, cleavage, short skirts, backless outfits or any combination of the above\" if they did not want to be remembered as skinterns. \"But men are not excluded from the fashion police's searchlight,\" she added. \"They can be seen sporting hoodies, flip flops, super baggy cargo pants, or some fresh-off-the-court sneakers, just to cite the most common occurrences.\" Similarly, in a 2013 piece giving dressing advice to interns in the \"Huffington Post\", fashion journalist Lauren Rothman, while generally focused on issues specific to women, reminds those heading for Silicon Valley to \"leave the hoodies and sweats to those who have already made their millions.\"\n\nOn some issues, sartorial choices of skinterns became accepted for all Hill staffers. In 2014, the \"Washington Post\" reported that flip-flops had become so common in congressional office buildings during summers as to cause a noise problem for some present when the women wearing them reported for work in the morning. \"It sounds like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,\" complained Abra Belke, a former staffer and lobbyist who by then was writing Capitol Hill Style, a fashion blog. \"Interns and junior staffers are just clomping down the hall in their $5 Old Navy flip-flops.\"\n\nSome observers think at that least some of the young women whose choices of clothing get them labeled as skinterns are doing so deliberately, in order to stand out from more conservatively dressed colleagues. \"Maybe if you can get noticed, you might get a full-time position,\" Wonkette editor Alex Pareene told ABC News in 2006. Nicole Williams, who coaches women entering the workforce, agrees that in some cases the skintern look is exactly what the wearer intends. \"You've got the summer to prove 'I can work here' or 'I can't work here,' so to get noticed, why not?\" one intern told \"Good Morning America\".\n\nIt has also been suggested that most misattired interns, male or female, are not familiar with professional dress standards, especially in an era of more relaxed standards such as those embodied by business casual. One intern who said she was from Washington state told the \"Washington Times\" in 2006 that her friends at home were stunned to hear that she was not allowed to wear jeans at her internship in the capital.\n\nThey may also misunderstand what is meant by vague instructions on how to dress. Carol Vellucci, director of the Career Center at the University of Baltimore, told \"The Baltimore Sun\" that many students seem to her to think that \"dressing up\" means wearing outfits they would typically wear to a nightclub or bar. \"It seems to be something that especially younger students aren't quite getting,\" she said.\n\nInterns may also not have the kind of established wardrobe one would expect from an older adult. \"These are young men and women, and they can’t be expected to be decked out in Brooks Brothers,\" Anthony Weiner, then a congressman from New York, told \"The Hill\" in its 2005 story. When he himself had interned for Charles Schumer in the House during the 1970s, he recalled that he owned one suit at the time, wearing it to the office every day but with a different shirt and tie.\n\nWhen the first started appearing in Congress, many staffers were cautious about counseling the skinterns in their midst on proper dress. \"You have to be respectful because chances are they are a donor's kid or a friend of the lawmaker,\" one male staffer told Rothstein about dealing with interns in general Instead, they often used indirect means, such as marginalization. \"We had a [recent] intern who we just called Belly. She walked around with a belly shirt on one time too many, and she did get into trouble. Nobody gave her work to do,\" recalled the press secretary who had shared the coinage of the term with Rothstein. In 2011, \"Washington Post\" reporter Jenna Johnson shared some anecdotes about the \"less-than-subtle\" tactics some offices had used, such as one office where the offending intern was asked not to be in the intern class's group photo for the member's website.\n\nSometimes more direct pressure has been used. In another incident, a young woman in overly transparent capris was made to stay seated at a desk until the congressman's wife had left the office for the day. Johnson wrote of an intern being given a tie and told to put it on. In another case the other interns staged an \"intervention\" during the local bar's happy hour after the workday.\n\nIn the wake of media attention to the phenomenon, many members of Congress began instituting stricter dress codes for staffers and interns. \"They should dress professional, and we demand that,\" a spokesman for Florida Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart told Rothstein. \"They shouldn't dress like they're working a corner. You shouldn't be dressing like Paris Hilton.\" A year later, Rothstein told the \"Washington Times\" the stricter attention to interns' dress was having the desired effect. \"I really think the interns are getting smarter because of these programs,\" she said. \"They're coming from college. They don't have the thought process. They're learning they can't dress like that.\"\n\nColleges have also been trying to prepare interns ahead of time. At the University of Baltimore, Vellucci teaches a cource on \"Personal and Professional Skills for Business\" which is a requisite for business majors, \"The Baltimore Sun\" reported. Outside the city, Towson University's business school stages a \"Dress Smart\" program in which students themselves model attire of varying degrees of propriety.\n\nIn 2014, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that KPMG staged a fashion show for its interns at the beginning of every summer. At a hotel in Orlando, the accounting firm's recruiters modeled acceptable outfits from stores such as The Gap, complemented by slide presentations on acceptable and unacceptable attire in the office. The 1,200 interns in attendance also received $200 gift cards to Men's Wearhouse and (for women) Banana Republic, as well as a free silk tie and piece of jewelry respectively. The company's recruiting director admitted that the show and gifts were prompted by some past interns dressing \"not in a way that we would have preferred\".\n\n\"I wince every time I hear the term 'skintern'\", a pseudonymous female intern complained in a 2010 post on the Feministing blog. Why, she asked, were male interns who dressed inappropriately merely labeled \"sloppy\", while young women who did were sexualized? \"'Slutty' has a very different and much more harmful repercussion for an intern's career than 'sloppy,'\" she noted. \"As a result, I am sometimes paralyzed in the mornings, worried that that my sweater seat is too tight or my button down is too low cut. I know that just by being a young female intern, I could be considered a 'skintern' regardless of my dress; and, my male co-workers will never worry about being reduced to a 'skintern.'\"\n\nShe also felt that it needlessly divided women who should be working together:\nFashion website The Gloss defended the skintern style in response to Goldstein's 2013 \"Slate\" piece. \"Surely, I am not the only person who thinks that a 'skintern' sounds like a member of a really cool club,\" wrote Jennifer Wright. \"Skinterns fear nothing. They are truly alive. The air rushes upon their skin whenever someone walks by their cubicle, but they're not chilly, they're fine ... Who would not want to be a skintern!?\"\n\nAnother response to Goldstein's piece took the opposite view. Elissa Strauss asked if Goldstein's sartorial advice was sexist in a post for \"The Sisterhood\", \"The Jewish Daily Forward\"'s blog on women's issues. At first, she granted, it might seem so: \"this is set of codes and rules that only apply to young women, or more specifically, their bodies. It told them that some parts of their bodies are considered vulgar and that wearing a pair of high platform heels might give others the wrong idea about their, well, purity. It is putting the responsibility on them to cover up, instead of on men to stop gawking.\"\n\n\"I see the logic here,\" Strauss admitted, recalling how self-conscious she had felt during puberty as her body started to change, a feeling she did not see shared by any of the young men she knew. \"But with all this said, I think there is still a conversation to be had with young women on how to dress, especially in a time when fashion seems almost uniformly inspired by Julia Roberts in \"Pretty Woman\". \"I choose-my-choice\" feminism sometimes leads women to empowerment, and other times leads them to choose \"choices\" from a patriarchal or, worse, misogynist culture.\"\n\nA young female intern wearing a miniskirt and very high heels \"might be able to convince herself that these fashion choices are truly her own,\" Strauss wrote. \"More likely, she has absorbed the many ways in which porn and strip-club culture have infiltrated mainstream culture—and what she takes for empowerment is really rooted in the commodification and degradation of female sexuality. Somebody needs to tell her this. They also need to tell her that it is way easier to walk in flats.\"\n"}

It may be used for a wide variety of other storage needs, including machine parts, hardware, or many other things; but offices are the location where they are most often found.\n\nSuch a cabinet is typically about 6 feet high (182.9 cm.), although some models are about high, and others around high, sometimes referred to as counter size. They are often wide, and deep. The 6-foot height and this width and depth are standard measurements for the most common models; even in countries where metric measurements are used for describing the dimensions, these dimensions are often exact multiples of feet or inches, presumably harking back to designs that were originally planned in exact numbers of feet or inches. Most of these standard dimensions are the same as with lockers, and the designs for the two types of cabinet appear to have a common ancestry; and indeed, stationery cabinets are usually manufactured by the same companies who produce lockers and filing cabinets.\n\nStationery cabinets come with three, four, or five steel shelves which are designed to fit across the width of the cabinet, fitted into brackets in the internal walls, and the position of these can be changed in small increments, thus allowing users to adjust the height of the shelves to their particular needs.\n\nThere are two doors at the front which swing outwards from the centre: to close and lock the cabinet, the left door is closed first, and then the right door, which interlocks with a flange on the edge of the left door, thus holding it in the closed position, and the cabinet may be locked by turning a key in a lock in the right door. For added security, this door is usually equipped with three-point locking. Unlike lockers, stationery cabinets are not usually sold with a padlocking option.\n\n"}

{"id": "701780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=701780", "title": "Suspenders", "text": "Suspenders\n\nOutside the United States the term \"suspenders\", or \"suspender belt,\" refers to an undergarment used to hold up stockings. This item is called a garter belt in American, while in UK and Australian English a garter is a device to support or adorn a sock.\n\nSuspenders or suspender belts, (known as \"garter belts\" in the USA), are an undergarment consisting of an elasticated material strip usually at least in width; it can be wider. Two or three elastic suspender slings are attached on each side, where the material is shaped to the contours of the body. The suspenders are typically clipped to stockings with metal clips into which a rubber disc is inserted through the stocking material effectively 'locking' the stocking in place. These are normally attached to a length of elastic allowing for adjustment. These clips, also known as suspender slings, are best attached to stockings with a simple welt that do not have lace, or 'hold-ups' with a silicone rubber lining.\nSuspender (garter) belts are usually worn at the waist or just slightly below to prevent the belt sliding down as it is pulled downward by the stockings. Some undergarments such as corselettes or girdles may come with suspender slings attached.\n\nSuspenders (American English, Canadian English) or braces (British English, Australian English) are fabric or leather straps worn over the shoulders to hold up trousers. The straps may be elasticated, either entirely or only at attachment ends, and most straps are of woven cloth forming an X or Y shape at the back. Suspenders are typically attached to trousers with clips or buttons using leather tabs at the ends. \n\nThere have been several precursors to suspenders/braces throughout the past 300 years, but modern versions were first invented in 1820 by Albert Thurston. They were once almost universally worn, due to the high cut of mid-nineteenth and early twentieth century trousers that made a belt impractical. During the nineteenth century, they were sometimes called galluses. Samuel Clemens, known for his work as the author Mark Twain, patented \"Adjustable and Detachable Straps for Garments\" (ADSG), becoming one of the first to receive a United States patent for suspenders/braces in 1871. After losing popularity during World War I, when men became accustomed to uniform belts, they remained regular attire throughout the 1920s. Because of their image as 'underwear', some men switched to belts during the 1930s as the vests (US/Canada) or waistcoats which had hidden suspenders became worn less often. This also signalled the switch in position of securing buttons from the outside of the waistband to the inside. \"Life\" magazine stated in 1938 that 60% of American men chose belts over suspenders. Though the return of fuller-cut trousers in the 1940s led to a revival, they did not dominate over belts again to the same extent. However, in the UK braces remained the norm to wear with suits and dress trousers.\n\nWhile passing in and out of fashion over the last century (alternating with belts in general preference), there has been a brief resurgence in interest, possibly due to the styles seen in films like \"Wall Street\". Many business people, newscasters (such as Larry King in the United States) and professionals such as lawyers also still wear suspenders/braces.\n\nNarrow, clip-on style suspenders/braces are also a typical part of skinhead, and to a lesser extent, punk fashion. In skinhead and punk fashion, suspenders/braces are typically between in width. \n\nMaterials used for making suspenders/braces have also changed over time, with newer additions such as rayon, a hard-wearing synthetic fiber, now offered. The traditional Woollen Boxcloth braces remain available but are very costly, a style sometimes worn by senior lawyers in London. Generally, a high quality rayon with elastic webbing is the fabric used to create braces, with silks webbing or tubed suiting cloths from mills such as Dugdale Bros of England also used.\n\nSuspenders/braces can be measured in a variety of different ways to ensure proper fitting. To accurate measure suspenders/braces, first start by measuring from the back pant line, then cross over the opposite shoulder down to the front pant line. Add a few additional inches for adjustments when required. \n\nGood quality smart suspenders/braces were traditionally considered white collar, or upper or upper-middle class, wear. They were made to be attached to trousers by buttons sewn onto the waistband. There are relatively few current manufacturers in the UK, but the classic button-on 'reform' end is also quite widely available in the United States.\n\nIn traditional or formal settings, it is considered a \"faux pas\" to wear both belt and suspenders/braces at the same time, though in the past this has not always been the case. Further, they were traditionally considered an undergarment and, as such, were considered inappropriate to be seen. From the time of their invention until World War II, the waistcoat, or a jumper or cardigan for coolness in the summer, covered suspenders/braces to prevent indecency. Similarly, jumpers and jackets kept the shirtsleeves hidden. In the inter-war period, however, men began removing jackets in public, and so this sensibility became eroded over time. It is perhaps only in Britain that a few 'die-hards' still consider it \"gauche\" to wear, for example, brightly coloured suspenders without jacket. Generally, it is now considered acceptable fashion, on both sides of the Atlantic, for men's suspenders/braces to be seen.\n\nThe trousers for this use have buttons in order to attach the leather tabs; these may be either on the outside, traditionally, or inside of trousers that do not have belt loops. With belt loops, buttons would be sewn on the inside of the waistband. Such trousers might also have a high back in the \"fishtail\" shape, though this is not as common now; This style may also have an additional adjustable strap at the back, as well as the two side adjusters placed on most belt-less trousers. Buttons should be placed about apart, an equal distance from the back seam. At the front, the first button should be set over the main pleat or crease, the second button again about apart. It is important to place the buttons in the correct position, as trousers with should remain slightly loose to hang correctly.\n\nIn the 2000s, it became fashionable for some younger women to wear suspenders/braces, a style that emerged from Mod styles in the late 1960s through to punk rock and skinhead styles of the late 1970s into the 1980s. One particular exponent of this fashion was Eurythmics vocalist Annie Lennox, whose fashion styling was akin to cross-dressing as a male character, with her dark business suits. Unisex fashion featured not only women wearing trousers and suspenders, but men in skirts with braces as an accessory .\n"}

Altered from the scripted lines and improvised by Hauer the night before filming, the monologue is frequently quoted; critic Mark Rowlands described it as \"perhaps the most moving death soliloquy in cinematic history\". The speech appears as the last track on the film's soundtrack album.\n\nThe dying replicant Roy Batty delivers the speech to Rick Deckard, moments after Batty saved his life despite Deckard being sent to terminate him. The scene occurs during a heavy downpour of rain, moments before Batty's own death. Reflecting on his experiences and imminent mortality he says (with dramatic pauses between each statement): \nIn the documentary \"Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner\", Hauer, director Ridley Scott, and screenwriter David Peoples confirm that Hauer largely wrote the \"Tears in Rain\" speech. Earlier versions in Peoples' draft screenplays included the sentence, \"I rode on the back decks of a blinker and watched C-beams glitter in the dark, near the Tannhäuser Gate.\" In his autobiography, Hauer said he merely cut the original scripted speech by several lines, adding only, \"All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain\", although the original script, displayed during the documentary, before Hauer's rewrite, does not mention \"Tannhäuser Gate\":\n\nHauer described this as \"opera talk\" and \"hi-tech speech\" with no bearing on the rest of the film, so he \"put a knife in it\" the night before filming, without Scott's knowledge. In an interview with Dan Jolin, Hauer said that these final lines showed that Batty wanted to \"make his mark on existence ... the replicant in the final scene, by dying, shows Deckard what a man is made of\". When Hauer performed the scene, the film crew applauded, and some even cried.\n\nSidney Perkowitz, writing in \"Hollywood science\", praised the speech: \"If there's a great speech in science fiction cinema, it's Batty's final words.\" He says that it \"underlines the replicant's humanlike characteristics mixed with its artificial capabilities\". Jason Vest, writing in \"Future Imperfect: Philip K. Dick at the Movies\", praised the delivery of the speech: \"Hauer's deft performance is heartbreaking in its gentle evocation of the memories, experiences, and passions that have driven Batty's short life\".\n\n\"The Guardian\" writer Michael Newton noted that \"in one of the film's most brilliant sequences, Roy and Deckard pursue each other through a murky apartment, playing a vicious child's game of hide and seek. As they do so, the similarities between them grow stronger – both are hunter and hunted, both are in pain, both struggle with a hurt, claw-like hand. If the film suggests a connection here that Deckard himself might still at this point deny, at the very end doubt falls away. Roy's life closes with an act of pity, one that raises him morally over the commercial institutions that would kill him. If Deckard cannot see himself in the other, Roy can. The white dove that implausibly flies up from Roy at the moment of his death perhaps stretches belief with its symbolism; but for me at least the movie has earned that moment, suggesting that in the replicant, as in the replicated technology of film itself, there remains a place for something human.\"\n\nThe place name Tannhäuser Gate (also written \"Tannhauser Gate\" and \"Tanhauser Gate\") is not explained in the film. It possibly derives from Richard Wagner's operatic adaptation of the legend of the medieval German knight and poet Tannhäuser. The term has since been reused in other science fiction sub-genres.\n\nJoanne Taylor, in an article discussing film noir and its epistemology, remarks on the relation between Wagner's opera and Batty's reference, and suggests that Batty aligns himself with Wagner's Tannhäuser, a character who has fallen from grace with men and with God. Both man and God, as she claims, are characters whose fate is beyond their own control.\n\nThe monologue's influence can be noted in various references and tributes.\n\nTad Williams paid homage in 1998 to the Batty monologue in \"River of Blue Fire\" (the second book of the Otherland series): \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe [...] Attack ships on the fire off the shores of the Nonestic Ocean. I watched magic blunderbusses flash and glitter in the dark near Glinda's palace. All those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain.\"\n\nRosa Montero and Lilit Zekulin Thwaites's science fiction novel \"Tears in Rain\" (2012) is set in a future where self-aware androids live among humans. The main character, Bruna Husky, is aware of her mortality in the same way that Roy Batty and his crew were, and Bruna often thinks about the significance of Batty's monologue. The androids in the novel, like those of \"Blade Runner\", are known as replicants.\n"}

It was located on a corner originally known as \"Pie Corner\", today at the junction of Giltspur Street and Cock Lane where the Golden Boy of Pye Corner resides, the name deriving from the magpie represented on the sign of an adjoining tavern. It is allegedly the place where the Great Fire of London stopped, after destroying a large part of the City of London in 1666. The statue of a cherub, initially built in the front of the pub, commemorates the end of the fire.\n\nIn 1761, the tenant of the house Thomas Andrews was convicted of sodomy and sentenced to death, but was pardoned by King George III in one of the first cases of public debate about homosexuality in England.\n\nUntil the 19th century, the \"Fortune of War\" was the chief house of north of the River Thames for resurrectionists, being officially appointed by the Royal Humane Society as a place \"for the reception of drowned persons\". The landlord used to show the room whereon benches round the walls were placed with the snatchers' names waiting till the surgeons at St Bartholomew's Hospital could run round and appraise them.\n\nThe public house was demolished in 1910.\n\nThe public house is mentioned in William Thackeray's Vanity Fair (1848) in a chapter entitled \"How to Live Well on Nothing a Year\" (ch. 37):\nThe bill for servants' porter at the \"Fortune of War\" public house is a curiosity in the chronicles of beer. Every servant also was owed the greater part of his wages, and thus kept up perforce an interest in the house. Nobody in fact was paid. Not the blacksmith who opened the lock; nor the glazier who mended the pane; nor the jobber who let the carriage; nor the groom who drove it; nor the butcher who provided the leg of mutton; nor the coals which roasted it; nor the cook who basted it; nor the servants who ate it: and this I am given to understand is not infrequently the way in which people live elegantly on nothing a year.\n\nIt is also mentioned by Charles Dickens in his novel \"A Tale of Two Cities\", where Jerry Cruncher of Tellson's Bank moonlights as a body snatcher.

{"id": "3206582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3206582", "title": "The School of Athens", "text": "The School of Athens\n\nThe School of Athens () is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael. It was painted between 1509 and 1511 as a part of Raphael's commission to decorate the rooms now known as the , in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. The was the first of the rooms to be decorated, and \"The School of Athens\", representing Philosophy, was probably the third painting to be finished there, after (Theology) on the opposite wall, and the \"Parnassus\" (Literature). The picture has long been seen as \"Raphael's masterpiece and the perfect embodiment of the classical spirit of the Renaissance\".\n\n\"The School of Athens\" is one of a group of four main frescoes on the walls of the Stanza (those on either side centrally interrupted by windows) that depict distinct branches of knowledge. Each theme is identified above by a separate tondo containing a majestic female figure seated in the clouds, with putti bearing the phrases: \"Seek Knowledge of Causes,\" \"Divine Inspiration,\" \"Knowledge of Things Divine\" (\"Disputa\"), \"To Each What Is Due.\" Accordingly, the figures on the walls below exemplify Philosophy, Poetry (including Music), Theology, and Law. The traditional title is not Raphael's. The subject of the \"School\" is actually \"Philosophy,\" or at least ancient Greek philosophy, and its overhead tondo-label, \"Causarum Cognitio\", tells us what kind, as it appears to echo Aristotle's emphasis on wisdom as knowing why, hence knowing the causes, in \"Metaphysics\" Book I and \"Physics\" Book II. Indeed, Plato and Aristotle appear to be the central figures in the scene. However, all the philosophers depicted sought knowledge of first causes. Many lived before Plato and Aristotle, and hardly a third were Athenians. The architecture contains Roman elements, but the general semi-circular setting having Plato and Aristotle at its centre might be alluding to Pythagoras' \"circumpunct\".\n\nCommentators have suggested that nearly every great ancient Greek philosopher can be found in the painting, but determining which are depicted is difficult, since Raphael made no designations outside possible likenesses, and no contemporary documents explain the painting. Compounding the problem, Raphael had to invent a system of iconography to allude to various figures for whom there were no traditional visual types. For example, while the Socrates figure is immediately recognizable from Classical busts, the alleged Epicurus is far removed from his standard type. Aside from the identities of the figures depicted, many aspects of the fresco have been variously interpreted, but few such interpretations are unanimously accepted among scholars.\n\nThe popular idea that the rhetorical gestures of Plato and Aristotle are kinds of pointing (to the heavens, and down to earth) is very likely. But Plato's \"Timaeus\" – which is the book Raphael places in his hand – was a sophisticated treatment of space, time, and change, including the Earth, which guided mathematical sciences for over a millennium. Aristotle, with his four-elements theory, held that all change on Earth was owing to motions of the heavens. In the painting Aristotle carries his \"Ethics\", which he denied could be reduced to a mathematical science. It is not certain how much the young Raphael knew of ancient philosophy, what guidance he might have had from people such as Bramante, or whether a detailed program was dictated by his sponsor, Pope Julius II.\n\nNevertheless, the fresco has even recently been interpreted as an exhortation to philosophy and, in a deeper way, as a visual representation of the role of Love in elevating people toward upper knowledge, largely in consonance with contemporary theories of Marsilio Ficino and other neo-Platonic thinkers linked to Raphael.\n\nFinally, according to Vasari, the scene includes Raphael himself, the Duke of Mantua, Zoroaster and some Evangelists.\n\nHowever, to Heinrich Wölfflin, \"it is quite wrong to attempt interpretations of the \"School of Athens\" as an esoteric treatise ... The all-important thing was the artistic motive which expressed a physical or spiritual state, and the name of the person was a matter of indifference\" in Raphael's time. Raphael's artistry then orchestrates a beautiful space, continuous with that of viewers in the Stanza, in which a great variety of human figures, each one expressing \"mental states by physical actions,\" interact, in a \"polyphony\" unlike anything in earlier art, in the ongoing dialogue of Philosophy.\n\nAn interpretation of the fresco relating to hidden symmetries of the figures and the star constructed by Bramante was given by Guerino Mazzola and collaborators. The main basis are two mirrored triangles on the drawing from Bramante (Euclid), which correspond to the feet positions of certain figures.\n\nThe identities of some of the philosophers in the picture, such as Plato and Aristotle, are certain. Beyond that, identifications of Raphael's figures have always been hypothetical. To complicate matters, beginning from Vasari's efforts, some have received multiple identifications, not only as ancients but also as figures contemporary with Raphael. Vasari mentions portraits of the young Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, leaning over Bramante with his hands raised near the bottom right, and Raphael himself. He was writing over 40 years after the painting, and never knew Raphael, but no doubt reflects what was believed in his time. Many other popular identifications of portraits are very dubious.\n\nA more comprehensive list of proposed identifications is given below:\n\n1: Zeno of Citium\n2: Epicurus\n3: unknown\n4: Boethius or Anaximander\n5: Averroes\n6: Pythagoras\n7: Alcibiades or Alexander the Great or Pericles\n8: Antisthenes or Xenophon\n9: unknown (sometimes identified as Hypatia in recent popular sources)\nor Fornarina as a personification of Love (Francesco Maria della Rovere?)\n10: Aeschines\n11: Parmenides or Nicomachus\n12: Socrates or Anaxagoras\n13: Heraclitus (Michelangelo?)\n14: Plato (Leonardo da Vinci?)\n15: Aristotle (Giuliano da Sangallo?)\n16: Diogenes of Sinope or Socrates\n17: Plotinus?\n18: Euclid or Archimedes (Bramante?)\n19: Strabo or Zoroaster? (Baldassare Castiglione?)\n20: Ptolemy\nR: Apelles (Raphael)\n21: Protogenes (Il Sodoma or Timoteo Viti)\n\nIn the center of the fresco, at its architecture's central vanishing point, are the two undisputed main subjects: Plato on the left and Aristotle, his student, on the right. Both figures hold modern (of the time), bound copies of their books in their left hands, while gesturing with their right. Plato holds \"Timaeus\", Aristotle his \"Nicomachean Ethics\". Plato is depicted as old, grey, wise-looking, and bare-foot. By contrast Aristotle, slightly ahead of him, is in mature manhood, handsome, well-shod and dressed with gold, and the youth about them seem to look his way. In addition, these two central figures gesture along different dimensions: Plato vertically, upward along the picture-plane, into the beautiful vault above; Aristotle on the horizontal plane at right-angles to the picture-plane (hence in strong foreshortening), initiating a powerful flow of space toward viewers.\n\nIt is popularly thought that their gestures indicate central aspects of their philosophies, for Plato, his Theory of Forms, and for Aristotle, his empiricist views, with an emphasis on concrete particulars. Many interpret the painting to show a divergence of the two philosophical schools. Plato argues a sense of timelessness whilst Aristotle looks into the physicality of life and the present realm.\n\nThe building is in the shape of a Greek cross, which some have suggested was intended to show a harmony between pagan philosophy and Christian theology (see Christianity and Paganism and Christian philosophy). The architecture of the building was inspired by the work of Bramante, who, according to Vasari, helped Raphael with the architecture in the picture. (The resulting architecture was similar to the then new St. Peter's Basilica.)\n\nThere are two sculptures in the background. The one on the left is the god Apollo, god of light, archery and music, holding a lyre. The sculpture on the right is Athena, goddess of wisdom, in her Roman guise as Minerva.\n\nThe main arch, above the characters, shows a meander (also known as a Greek fret or Greek key design), a design using continuous lines that repeat in a \"series of rectangular bends\" which originated on pottery of the Greek Geometric period and then become widely used in ancient Greek architectural friezes.\n\nA number of drawings made by Raphael as studies for the School of Athens are extant. A study for the Diogenes is in the Städel in Frankfurt while a study for the group around Pythagoras, in the lower left of the painting, is preserved in the Albertina Museum in Vienna. Several drawings, showing the two men talking while walking up the steps on the right and the Medusa on Athena's shield, the statue of Athena (Minerva) and three other statues, a study for the combat-scene in the relief below Apollo and \"Euclid\" teaching his pupils are in the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology at Oxford University.\n\nThe cartoon for the painting is in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana in Milan.\n\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum has a rectangular version over 4 metres by 8 metres in size, painted on canvas, dated 1755 by Anton Raphael Mengs on display in the eastern Cast Court.\n\nModern reproductions of the fresco abound. For example, a full-size one can be seen in the auditorium of Old Cabell Hall at the University of Virginia. Produced in 1902 by George W. Breck to replace an older reproduction that was destroyed in a fire in 1895, it is four inches off scale from the original, because the Vatican would not allow identical reproductions of its art works.\n\nOther reproductions include: by Neide, in Königsberg Cathedral, Kaliningrad, in the University of North Carolina at Asheville's Highsmith University Student Union, and a recent one in the seminar room at Baylor University's Brooks College. A copy of Raphael's School of Athens was painted on the wall of the ceremonial stairwell that leads to the famous, main-floor reading room of the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève in Paris.\n\nThe two figures at the left of Plotinus were used as part of the cover art of both \"Use Your Illusion I\" and \"II\" albums of Guns N' Roses.\n\nA similar theme is known as Plato's Academy mosaic, and perhaps emerged in form of statues at the Serapeum of Alexandria and Memphis Saqqara. Mimaut mentioned in the 19th century nine statues at Serapeum of Alexandria holding rolls. Eleven statues were found at Saqqara. A review of \"Les Statues Ptolémaïques du Sarapieion de Memphis\" noted they were probably sculpted in the 3rd century with limestone and stucco, some standing others sitting. Rowe and Rees 1956 suggested that both scenes in the Serapeum of Alexandria and Saqqara share a similar theme, such as with Plato's Academy mosaic, with Saqqara figures attributed to: \"(1) Pindare, (2) Démétrios de Phalère, (3) x (?), (4) Orphée (?) aux oiseaux, (5) Hésiode, (6) Homère, (7) x (?), (8) Protagoras, (9) Thalès, (10) Héraclite, (11) Platon, (12) Aristote (?).\" However, there have been other suggestions, see for instance Mattusch 2008, a common identification seems to be Plato as a central figure and Thales.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1568321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1568321", "title": "The Shadow over Innsmouth", "text": "The Shadow over Innsmouth\n\nThe Shadow over Innsmouth is a horror novella by American author H. P. Lovecraft, written in November–December 1931. It forms part of the Cthulhu Mythos, using \nits motif of a malign undersea civilization, and references several shared elements of the Mythos, including place-names, mythical creatures, and invocations. \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\" is the only Lovecraft story which was published in book form during his lifetime.\n\nThe narrator is a student conducting an antiquarian tour of New England. He travels through the nearby decrepit seaport of Innsmouth which is suggested as a cheaper and potentially interesting next leg of his journey. He travels to Innsmouth, interacting with strange people, and observes disturbing events that ultimately lead to horrifying, and personal, revelations.\n\nThe narrator explains how he instigated a secret investigation of the ruined town of Innsmouth, Massachusetts, by the U.S. government. He proceeds to describe in detail the events surrounding his initial interest in the town, which lies along the route of his tour across New England, taken when he was twenty-one. While he waits for the bus that will take him to Innsmouth, he busies himself in the neighboring Newburyport by gathering information on the town from the locals; all of it having superstitious overtones. The narrator finds Innsmouth to be a mostly deserted fishing town, full of dilapidated buildings and people who walk with a distinctive shambling gait and have \"queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy, stary eyes\". The only person in town who appears normal is a grocery store clerk from neighboring Arkham. The narrator gathers much information from the clerk, including a map of the town and the name of Zadok Allen, an elderly local who might give him information when plied with drink. The narrator hears repeatedly that outsiders are never welcomed in Innsmouth, and that strangers, particularly government investigators, have disappeared when they pry too deeply into the town.\n\nThe narrator meets Zadok, who explains that an Innsmouth merchant named Obed Marsh discovered a race of fish-like humanoids known as the Deep Ones. When hard times fell on the town, Obed established a cult called the Esoteric Order of Dagon, which offered human sacrifices to the Deep Ones in exchange for wealth in the form of large fish hauls and unique jewelry. When Obed and his followers were arrested, the Deep Ones attacked the town and killed more than half of its population, leaving the survivors with no other choice than to continue Obed's practices. Male and female inhabitants were forced to breed with the Deep Ones, producing hybrid offspring which have the appearance of normal humans in early life but, in adulthood, slowly transform into Deep Ones themselves and leave the surface to live in ancient undersea cities for eternity. He further explains that these ocean-dwellers have designs on the surface world and have been planning the use of Shoggoth to conquer or transform it. Zadok sees strange waves approaching the dock and tells the narrator that they have been seen, urging him to leave town immediately. The narrator is unnerved, but ultimately dismisses the story. Once he leaves, Zadok disappears and is never seen again.\n\nAfter being told that the bus is experiencing engine trouble, the narrator has no choice but to spend the night in a musty hotel, the Gilman House. While attempting to sleep, he hears noises at his door as if someone is trying to enter. Wasting no time, he escapes out a window and through the streets while a town-wide hunt for him occurs, forcing him at times to imitate the peculiar walk of the Innsmouth locals as he walks past search parties in the darkness. Eventually, he makes his way towards railroad tracks and hears a procession of Deep Ones passing in the road before him. Against his judgment, he opens his eyes to see the creatures and faints at his hiding spot. He wakes up unharmed. Over the years that pass, he researches his family tree and discovers that he is a descendant of Obed Marsh, and realizes that he is changing into one of the Deep Ones. As the story ends, the narrator is accepting his fate and feels he will be happy living with the Deep Ones. He plans to break out his cousin from an asylum, who is even further transformed than he, and take him to the Deep Ones' city beneath the sea.\n\n\nThis is a family tree of the story's protagonist and narrator, Robert Olmstead, as described in \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\" and in Lovecraft's notes.\n\n<br>\n\nBoth of Lovecraft's parents died in a mental hospital, and some critics believe that a concern with having inherited a propensity for physical and mental degeneration is reflected in the plot of \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\". It also shares some themes with his earlier story, \"Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family\". Cthulhu, an entity from previous Lovecraft stories, is the overlord of the sea creatures. The mind of the narrator deteriorates when he is afforded a glimpse of what exists outside his perceived reality. This is a central tenet of Cosmicism, which Lovecraft emphasizes in the opening sentence of \"The Call of Cthulhu\": \"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.\"\n\nLovecraft based the town of Innsmouth on his impressions of Newburyport, Massachusetts, which he had visited in 1923 and fall 1931. The real Newburyport features as a neighboring town in the narrative. A likely influence on the plot is Lovecraft's horror of miscegenation, which is documented by Lovecraft biographer L. Sprague de Camp and others.\n\nRobert M. Price cites two works as literary sources for \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\": Robert W. Chambers' \"The Harbor-Master\" and Irvin S. Cobb's \"Fishhead\". Chambers' story concerns the discovery of \"the remnants of the last race of amphibious human beings,\" living in a five-mile deep chasm just off the Atlantic coast. The creature of the title is described as \"a man with round, fixed, fishy eyes, and soft, slaty skin. But the horror of the thing were the two gills that swelled and relaxed spasmodically.\" Lovecraft was evidently impressed by this tale, writing in a letter to Frank Belknap Long: \"God! The Harbour-Master!!!\" \"Fishhead\" is the story of a \"human monstrosity\" with an uncanny resemblance to a fish: his skull sloped back so abruptly that he could hardly be said to have a forehead at all; his chin slanted off right into nothing. His eyes were small and round with shallow, glazed, pink-yellow pupils, and they were set wide apart on his head, and they were unwinking and staring, like a fish's eyes. Lovecraft, in \"Supernatural Horror in Literature,\" called Cobb's story \"banefully effective in its portrayal of unnatural affinities between a hybrid idiot and the strange fish of an isolated lake\". Price notes that Fishhead, as the \"son of a Negro father and a half-breed Indian mother,\" \"embodies unambiguously the basic premise of \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\"... This, of course, is really what Lovecraft found revolting in the idea of interracial marriage...the subtextual hook of different ethnic races mating and 'polluting' the gene pool.\" Price points out the resemblance in names between the Deep One city of Y'ha-nthlei and Yoharneth-Lahai, a fictional deity in Lord Dunsany's \"The Gods of Pegana,\" who \"sendeth little dreams out of Pegana to please the people of Earth\"—a precursor to Lovecraft's fictional deity Cthulhu, who sends less pleasant dreams from R'lyeh.\n\nThe description of the Deep Ones has similarities to the sea creature described in H.G. Wells' short story \"In the Abyss\" (1896):\n\n\nLovecraft was quite critical of \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\", writing to August Derleth that the story \"has all the defects I deplore—especially in point of style, where hackneyed phrases & rhythms have crept in despite all precautions... No—I don't intend to offer 'The Shadow Over Innsmouth' for publication, for it would stand no chance of acceptance.\"\n\nThe story was rejected by \"Weird Tales\" editor Farnsworth Wright when Derleth surreptitiously submitted it for publication in 1933. \"I have read Lovecraft's story...and must confess that it fascinates me,\" he wrote to Derleth. \"But I don't know just what I can do with it. It is hard to break a story of this kind into two parts, and it is too long to run complete in one part.\"\n\nIn late 1935, William L. Crawford's Visionary Publishing Company began the process of issuing \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\" as a book. The project came to fruition in November 1936 (although the copyright page declares the date of publication as April 1936), but the book had so many typographical errors that Lovecraft insisted on an errata sheet (which was also faulty). Lovecraft was displeased with the production; writing to his correspondent Lee McBride White on Nov 30, 1936, he wrote: \"My \"Shadow Over Innsmouth\" is now out - but as a first cloth-bound book it doesn't awake any enthusiasm in me. Indeed, it is one of the lousiest jobs I've ever seen - 30 misprints, slovenly format, & loose, slipshod binding. The solitary redeeming feature is the set of Utpatel illustrations - one of which, on the dust wrapper, saves the appearance of the thing...\" \n\nIt had a bound run of 200 copies — the only book of Lovecraft's fiction distributed during his lifetime. Crawford had printed 400 copies but bound only 200; the others were destroyed later. Of this edition Robert Weinberg has written: \"Only a few hundred copies of the book were printed, and even less than that were sold, even though it was available at the bargain price of $1 per copy. It featured good paper, black linen binding and four illustrations by Frank Utpatel. The book was the only bound hardcover to appear during Lovecraft's lifetime and became one of the true rarities in the collecting field. Its failure, and the poor sales of third non-fantasy book convinced William Crawford of the futility of his efforts.\" \n\nAfter Lovecraft's death (and Wright's), the story appeared in an unauthorized abridged version in the January 1942 issue of \"Weird Tales\".\n\nAs L Sprague de Camp noted, the action sections of \"Innsmouth\" are a departure for Lovecraft; the story's tense and memorable siege scene within the titular town's hotel reveals a flair in execution on a par with some of the most compelling chapters of R L Stevenson's \"Kidnapped\". August Derleth called \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\" \"a dark, brooding story, typical of Lovecraft at his best.\" Robert Weinberg praised it as \"a well-written story\". According to de Camp, Lovecraft distrusted his ability to narrate action, and the story is unusual in that Lovecraft includes sustained and effective action writing during the culmination of the events in Innsmouth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Shadow over Innsmouth\" was republished in a 1994 anthology with stories by other authors based on Innsmouth and the Old Ones in \"Shadows over Innsmouth\".

Fox raised a seed investment round for Ventoura in mid 2014, and Ventoura launched in early 2015. \n\nDue to disputes, Fox left the company to found another more successful mobile application called Sweat Mobile and ended up selling his shares to an investor in early 2016. \n\nVentoura was not founded by IT/engineering professionals, nor did it relocate offices, as displayed here earlier and displayed in this article by Griffith University. \n\nTravelers create a profile including their travel dates and destinations. Travelers will then be presented with profiles of other travelers who have entered corresponding dates and destinations. The itinerary function means users can connect with other travelers before embarking on a trip.\n\nUsing the same interface, travelers can connect with locals hosting tours in their destinations. The matching function also allows locals to meet travelers while earning income by providing tours.\n\n"}

However, under the 1969 Act, the remit of the organisation extends only to Great Britain rather than the whole of the United Kingdom.\nVisitBritain was created in April 2003 to market Britain to the rest of the world and to promote and develop the visitor economy of England. It was formed out of a merger between the British Tourist Authority and the English Tourism Council, and is a non-departmental public body responsible to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. In April 2009, VisitEngland became more of a stand-alone body from VisitBritain, more on a par with the devolved entities, VisitScotland and VisitWales.\n\nIn 2005, it was voted the world's leading Tourist and Convention Bureau in the World Travel Awards.\nIn the Webby Awards it has been an Official Honoree in the 10th and 12th Webby Awards in the Tourism Category.\nIn 2008 it was also awarded the Travelmole Best Tourist Board Website award.\n\nVisitBritain is a founding partner of ENAT, the European Network for Accessible Tourism, an international organisation based in Europe, set up in 2006 to promote accessible tourism.\n\nBritain on View is the official image library of VisitBritain. It is an online searchable image database containing over 50,000 high quality stock photographs, all available to download directly from the website.\n\n\n"}

However, a critical observer may observe that software manages to outgrow hardware in size and sluggishness.\" Other observers had noted this for some time before; indeed the trend was becoming obvious as early as 1987.\n\nHe states two contributing factors to the acceptance of ever-growing software as: \"rapidly growing hardware performance,\" and \"customers' ignorance of features that are essential versus nice-to-have\". Enhanced user convenience and functionality supposedly justify the increased size of software, but Wirth argues that people are increasingly misinterpreting complexity as sophistication, that \"these details are cute but not essential, and they have a hidden cost\". As a result, he calls for the creation of \"leaner\" software, and pioneered the development of Oberon, a software system developed between 1986 and 1989 based on nothing but hardware. Its primary goal was to show that software can be developed with a fraction of the memory capacity and processor power usually required, without sacrificing flexibility, functionality, or user convenience.\n\nThe law was restated in 2009 and attributed to Larry Page, founder of Google. It has been referred to as Page's law. The first use of that name is attributed to Sergey Brin at the Google I/O Conference 2009.\n\nOther common forms use the names of the leading hardware and software companies of the 1990s (Intel & Microsoft), or their CEOs (Andy Grove & Bill Gates): \"What Intel giveth, Microsoft taketh away\" and \"What Andy giveth, Bill taketh away\".\n\nGates's law (\"The speed of software halves every 18 months\") is a variant on Wirth's law, borrowing its name from Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft. It is an observation that the speed of commercial software generally slows by 50% every 18 months, thereby negating all the benefits of Moore's law. This could occur for a variety of reasons: \"featuritis\", \"code cruft\", developer laziness, or a management turnover whose design philosophy does not coincide with the previous manager.\n\nMay's law, named after David May, is a variant stating: \"Software efficiency halves every 18 months, compensating Moore's law\".\n\n"}
