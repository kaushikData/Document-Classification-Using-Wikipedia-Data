{"id": "159187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=159187", "title": "Apple pie", "text": "Apple pie\n\nAn apple pie is a pie or a tart, in which the principal filling ingredient is apple. It is, on occasion, served with whipped cream or ice cream on top, (which is known as apple pie a la mode), or with cheddar cheese. The pastry is generally used top-and-bottom, making it a double-crust pie; the upper crust may be a circular or a pastry lattice woven of crosswise strips. Depending on the baker's preference, the bottom of the double-crust may be baked first (before baking the whole pie) to prevent the bottom from getting soggy. Exceptions are deep-dish apple pie, with a top crust only, and open-face Tarte Tatin. Apple pie is an unofficial symbol of the United States and one of its signature comfort foods.\n\nApple pie can be made with many different sorts of apples. The more popular cooking apples include, Braeburn, Gala, Cortland, Bramley, Empire, Northern Spy, Granny Smith, and McIntosh. The fruit for the pie can be fresh, canned, or reconstituted from dried apples. These different types of apples (canned, dried, fresh) affects the final texture and the length of cooking time required will vary, therefore people disagree on if it affects the flavour or not. Dried or preserved apples were originally substituted only at times when fresh fruit was unavailable. Along with the apples people commonly use, cinnamon, salt, butter, and most importantly sugar. Though most of the old recipes don't include sugar due to the price or having a better sweetener option, most people definitely use it today.\nApple pie is often served in the style of \"à la Mode\" (topped with ice cream). Alternatively, a piece of sharp cheddar cheese is, at times, placed on top of or alongside a slice of the finished pie. Apple pie with cheddar is popular in the American Midwest and New England, particularly in Vermont, where it is considered the state dish.\n\nRecipes for Dutch apple pie go back to the Middle Ages. An early Dutch cookbook from 1514, \"Een notabel boecxken van cokeryen\" (\"A notable little cookery book\"), documents a recipe for \"Appeltaerten\" (compare modern Dutch \"Appeltaarten\" \"apple pies\"). This early recipe was a simple one, requiring only a standard pie crust, slices of especially soft apples with their skin and seeds removed, and \"den selven deeghe daer die taerte af ghemaect es\" (roughly meaning \"the same dough that the pie [crust] is made of\") to fill in the top. It was then baked in a typical Dutch oven. Once baked, the top crust (except at the edges) would be cut out from the middle, after which the apple slices were potentially put through a sieve before the pie was stirred with a wooden spoon. At this point the book recommends adding several spices to the pie, namely: cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, mace and powdered sugar. Finally, after mixing the ingredients into the pie with cream, it is once again put into the oven to dry.\n\nTraditional Dutch apple pie comes in two varieties, a crumb (\"appelkruimeltaart\") and a lattice (\"appeltaart\") style pie. Both recipes are distinct in that they typically call for flavourings of cinnamon and lemon juice to be added and differ in texture, not taste. Dutch apple pies may include ingredients such as full-cream butter, raisins and almond paste, in addition to ingredients such as apples and sugar, which they have in common with other recipes.\n\nThe basis of Dutch apple pie is a crust on the bottom and around the edges. This crust is then filled with pieces or slices of apple, usually a crisp and mildly tart variety such as Goudreinet or Elstar. Cinnamon and sugar are generally mixed in with the apple filling. Atop the filling, strands of dough cover the pie in a lattice holding the filling in place but keeping it visible or cover the pie with crumbs. It can be eaten warm or cold, sometimes with a dash of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. In the US, \"Dutch apple pie\" refers specifically to the apple pie style with a crumb, streusel, topping.\n\nEnglish apple pie recipes go back to the time of Chaucer. The 1381 recipe (see illustration at right) lists the ingredients as \"good apples, good spices, figs, raisins and pears.\" The \"cofyn\" of the recipe is a casing of pastry. Saffron is used for colouring the pie filling. Today, the English style incorporates generous layers of sweetened slices of, usually, Bramley apple; layered into a dome shape to allow for downward shrinkage, and thus avoid a saggy middle, then topped with butter or lard shortcrust pastry, and baked until the apple filling is cooked.\n\nIn English-speaking countries, apple pie, often classified as a satisfying 'comfort' food, is a dessert of enduring popularity, whether it's eaten hot or cold, on its own or with ice cream, double cream, or custard.\n\nFrench style apple pie is very different compared to the American version of the sweet dessert. Instead of it being right side up with crust on top and bottom, it actually is upside down, with the fruit being caramelized. This can be made not only with apples but other fruits or vegetables as well, for example, pears or tomatoes.\n\"see Tarte Tatin\"\n\nThe Swedish style apple pie is predominantly a variety of apple crumble, rather than a traditional pastry pie. Often, breadcrumbs are used (wholly or partially) instead of flour, and sometimes rolled oats. It is usually flavoured with cinnamon and served with vanilla custard or ice cream. There is also a very popular version called \"äppelkaka\" (apple cake), which differs from the pie in that it is a sponge cake baked with fresh apple pieces in it. \n\nApple pie was brought to the colonies by the British, Dutch, and Swedes during the 17th and 18th centuries. The apple pie had to wait for the planting of European varieties, brought across the Atlantic, to become fruit-bearing apple trees, to be selected for their cooking qualities as there were no native apples except crabapples, which yield very small and sour fruit. In the meantime, the colonists were more likely to make their pies, or \"pasties\", from meat, calling them coffins (meaning basket) rather than fruit; and the main use for apples, once they were available, was in cider. However, there are American apple pie recipes, both manuscript and printed, from the 18th century, and it has since become a very popular dessert. Apple varieties are usually propagated by grafting, as clones, but in the New World, planting from seeds was more popular, which quickly led to the development of hundreds of new native varieties.\n\nApple pie was a common food in 18th-century Delaware. As noted by the New Sweden historian Dr. Israel Acrelius in a letter: \"Apple pie is used throughout the whole year, and when fresh Apples are no longer to be had, dried ones are used. It is the evening meal of children.\"\n\nThe mock apple pie, made from crackers, was probably invented for use aboard ships, as it was known to the British Royal Navy as early as 1812. The earliest known published recipes for mock apple pie date from the antebellum period of the 1850s. In the 1930s, and for many years afterwards, Ritz Crackers promoted a recipe for mock apple pie using its product, along with sugar and various spices.\n\nAlthough eaten in Europe since long before the European colonization of the Americas, apple pie as used in the phrase \"as American as apple pie\" describes something as being \"typically American.\" \" In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, apple pie became a symbol of American prosperity and national pride. A newspaper article published in 1902 declared that \"No pie-eating people can be permanently vanquished.\" The dish was also commemorated in the phrase \"for Mom and apple pie\" - supposedly the stock answer of American soldiers in World War II, whenever journalists asked why they were going to war. Jack Holden and Frances Kay sang in their patriotic 1950 song \"The Fiery Bear\", creating contrast between this symbol of U.S. culture and the Russian bear of the Soviet Union:\n\nAdvertisers exploited the patriotic connection in the 1970s with the commercial jingle \"baseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet\".\n\nModern American recipes for apple pie usually indicate a pastry that is 9 inches in diameter in a fluted pie plate, with an apple filling spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice, and it may or may not have a lattice or shapes cut out of the top for decoration. One out of five Americans surveyed (19%) prefer apple pie over all others, followed by pumpkin (13%)\nand pecan (12%).\n\nThe unincorporated community of Pie Town, New Mexico is named after apple pie.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3789679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3789679", "title": "Basque cuisine", "text": "Basque cuisine\n\nBasque cuisine refers to the cuisine of the Basque Country and includes meats and fish grilled over hot coals, marmitako and lamb stews, cod, Tolosa bean dishes, paprikas from Lekeitio, pintxos (Basque tapas), Idiazabal sheep's cheese, txakoli sparkling wine, and Basque cider.\n\nA basquaise is a type of dish prepared in the style of Basque cuisine that often includes tomatoes and sweet or hot red peppers.\n\nBasque cuisine is influenced by the abundance of produce from the sea on one side and the fertile Ebro valley on the other. The great mountainous nature of the Basque Country has led to a difference between coastal cuisine dominated by fish and seafood, and inland cuisine with fresh and cured meats, many vegetables and legumes, and freshwater fish and salt cod. The French and Spanish influence is strong also, with a noted difference between the cuisine of either side of the modern border; even iconic Basque dishes and products, such as txakoli from the South, or Gâteau Basque (Biskotx) and Jambon de Bayonne from the North, are rarely seen on the other side.\n\nBasques have also been quick to absorb new ingredients and techniques from new settlers and from their own trade and exploration links. Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal created a chocolate and confectionery industry in Bayonne still well-known today, and part of a wider confectionery and pastry tradition across the Basque Country. Basques embraced the potato and the capsicum, used in hams, sausages and recipes, with pepper festivals around the area, notably Ezpeleta and Puente la Reina.\n\nOlive oil is more commonly used than vegetable oil in Basque cooking.\n\nCuisine and the kitchen are at the heart of Basque culture, and there is a Museum of Gastronomy in Llodio.\n\nOne of the staple cookbooks for traditional Basque dishes was initially published in 1933. \"La cocina de Nicolasa\" (the Kitchen of Nicolasa) by Nicolasa Pradera has gone into 20 editions.\n\nIn addition to the dishes and products of the Basque Country, there are features of the way of preparing and sharing food unique to the area.\n\nCider houses (sagardotegiak) are a feature of the hills around Donostia, especially near Astigarraga. These are usually large country restaurants with enormous barrels of cider. Cider is poured from a height straight into the glass for visitors, with a rustic menu invariably of salt cod omelette, grilled T-bone steak and ewes' milk cheese with walnuts and quince paste. The cider houses are only open for a few months of the year.\n\nThe \"txikiteo\" is the tapas crawl from bar to bar seen across Spain, but it reaches its pinnacle in Donostia, with hundreds of people on the streets of the old town wandering from bar to bar, each known for its specialty, whether it be croquettes, tortilla, toast, or seafood. The txikiteo is also popular in cities such as Pamplona and Bilbao.\n\n\"Gerezi beltza arno gorriakin\" is a cherry soup served warm or cold. The cherries are poached in wine, often with enough sugar added to make a light syrup. A cherry without pits is preferred for this dish. To release their flavor, the cherries are carefully pitted or cut in half. Usually the soup is prepared on the day it will be served, because 24 hours is enough time for the cherries to blanch noticeably in the liquid. The soup is often served with a dollop of sour cream, crème fraîche, or ice cream.\n\nGastronomic societies are organisations, almost always of men, who cook and eat together in a communal txoko. In large cities, the society's premises can be large and formally organised, but the \"txoko\" is frequently a small space owned by a group of friends in smaller towns and suburbs, where food and costs are shared. The first txoko was noted in Donostia in 1870. This unique feature of the Spanish Basque Country enables men to participate in the cooking process and spend time together away from the traditionally formidable matriarchs (\"etxekoandreak\"). In recent years, women have been allowed into some clubs.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s Basque chefs were influenced by the \"nouvelle cuisine\" of France and created the \"nouvelle cuisine basque\", radically original in its form but solidly Basque in substance, with lighter and less rustic versions of traditional dishes and flavours. The first Spanish restaurant to be awarded 3 stars in the Michelin Guide was, in fact, \"Zalacaín\", a Basque restaurant, although located in Madrid. Juan Mari Arzak in Donostia became the most famous exponent and one of the first three-star Michelin Guide restaurants in Spain.\nIn a few years the movement swept across Spain, becoming the state's default haute cuisine. Many tapas bars, especially in San Sebastián, serve modern-style \"pintxos\" employing novel techniques and ingredients. In more recent years, young chefs, such as Martin Berasategui, have given new impetus to Basque cuisine.\n\nBasque cuisine has continued to have an influence on international cuisine, particularly in Spain and France where it is highly regarded. Catalan chef Ferran Adrià has taken the techniques pioneered by Arzak and other Basque chefs to new heights. Karlos Arguiñano has popularised Basque cuisine in Spain through TV and books. Teresa Barrenechea was among the first people to bring traditional Basque cuisine to America with her first restaurant Marichu in Bronxville in 1991, where she hired Chef Joseba Encabo to set up, develop the menus and run the restaurant till soon later he was offered a position as faculty at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Teresa Barrenechea and husband Raynold von Samson continued to promote Basque cuisine in America by opening their second Marichu restaurant in Manhattan in 1994, which was close to the United Nations Headquarters. Teresa Barrenechea has written two books, \"The Basque Table\" (Harvard Common Press, Boston 1998) and \"The Cuisines of Spain\" (Ten Speed, Berkley 2005). Teresa Barrenechea is the holder of two awards: Premio Nacional de Gastronomía (National Prize of Gastronomy, the highest culinary award given by the Spanish Administration) and Best Regional Cuisine Book at the 5th World Cookbook Fair, Périgueux (France). At the other end of the scale, Basque-style pintxos bars are common in Barcelona and Madrid. In cities where large numbers of Basque people emigrated, such as Buenos Aires, Argentina; São Paulo, Brazil, Boise, Idaho; Fresno, California, and Bakersfield, California, there are several Basque restaurants and a noted Basque influence on the local cuisine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is culturally accepted in parts of the Balkans, the Middle East, the Central Asian region of Afghanistan, and the South Asian region of Pakistan. In regions such as Puerto Rico and continental areas of the United States it is practiced illegally, especially on holidays like New Year's Eve.\n\nCommon occasions for celebratory gunfire include New Year's Day as well as religious holidays such as Eid. The practice may result in random death and injury from stray bullets. Property damage is sometimes another result of celebratory gunfire; shattered windows and damaged roofs are often found after such celebrations.\n\nBullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.\n\nA study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that 80% of celebratory gunfire-related injuries are to the head, feet, and shoulders. In Puerto Rico, about two people die and about 25 more are injured each year from celebratory gunfire on New Year's Eve, the CDC says. Between the years 1985 and 1992, doctors at the King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, treated some 118 people for random falling-bullet injuries. Thirty-eight of them died.\n\nFirearms expert Julian Hatcher studied falling bullets in the 1920s and calculated that .30 caliber rounds reach terminal velocities of 90 m/s (300 feet per second or 186 miles per hour).\nA bullet traveling at only 61 m/s (200 feet per second) to 100 m/s (330 feet per second) can penetrate human skin.\n\nIn 2005, the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA) ran education campaigns on the dangers of celebratory gunfire in Serbia and Montenegro.\nIn Serbia, the campaign slogan was \"every bullet that is fired up, must come down.\"\n\nBullets often lodge in roofs, causing minor damage that requires repair in most cases. Normally, the bullet will penetrate the roof surface through to the roof deck, leaving a hole where water may run into the building and cause a leak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe non-fiction U.S. cable television program \"MythBusters\" on the Discovery Channel covered this topic in Episode 50: \"Bullets Fired Up\" (original airdate: April 19, 2006). Special-effects experts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman conducted a series of experiments to answer the question: \"Can celebratory gunfire kill when the bullets fall back to earth?\"\n\nUsing pig carcasses, they worked out the terminal velocity of a falling bullet and had a mixed result, answering the question with all three of the show's possible outcomes: Confirmed, Plausible and Busted. They tested falling bullets by firing them from both a handgun and a rifle, by firing them from an air gun designed to propel them at terminal velocity, and by dropping them in the desert from an instrumented balloon.\n\nThey found that while bullets traveling on a perfectly vertical trajectory tumble on the way down, creating turbulence that reduces terminal velocity below that which would kill, it was very difficult to fire a bullet in a near-ideal vertical trajectory. In practice, bullets were likely to remain spin-stabilized on a ballistic trajectory and fall at a potentially lethal terminal velocity. They also verified cases of actual deaths from falling bullets.\n\n\n\n"}

It was built in 1763 as a Carmelite church and monastery, and was converted to a theatre in 1787. The theatre was home to the first play in Hungarian language in 1790.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the area was occupied by a Franciscan temple devoted to St. John, built between 1269-70. The building was converted to a mosque during the Turkish occupation, and was destroyed in the 1686 siege of Buda. The plot was given to the Carmelites in 1693. Laying the foundation stone in 1725, their temple was built by 1736, but only consecrated in 1763. Joseph II dissolved the order in 1784, and on his trip to Buda in 1786, he personally arranged to convert the temple to a theatre, to entertain government officers of Buda. The plans were made by Wolfgang von Kempelen. A part of the crypt under the sanctuary was rebuilt as a trap room, and cells functioned as changing rooms. The high altar became the stage. With a three-story auditorium, and a capacity of 1200 seats, the premiere was held on 17 October 1787, from which on the theatre was home to mainly German productions for the next few decades. The first ever play in the Hungarian language was premiered on its stage, on 25 October 1790, by the company of László Kelemen. On 7 May 1800 Beethoven gave a concert here. The building was renovated in 1815.\n\nAccording to a pact with the municipality of Buda, for a symbolic lease, a company like from Kassa played in the theatre between 1833 and 1837, including acclaimed actors of the era, like Déryné, Márton Lendvay or Gábor Egressy. They formed the foundations of the later National Theatre opening in 1837. Until 1870, German troupes were playing in the building, when German plays were banned by the municipality. From 1871, the theatre was home to the National Theater, and from 1885–86, also hosted plays of the Népszínház the Opera House, and the Academy of Drama.\n\nAfter World War I, the theatre re-opened on 21 March 1918. Plans were made to make the theatre a chamber theatre of the National Theatre, but it was found unfit for the task. Smaller groups played in the building until 1924, when, after the gallery collapsed, it was closed for the next five decades. During World War II, it received severe bomb hits, collapsing the balcony. Until the end of the war, the building functioned as an army storage. Renovations took place in 1947.\n\nThe Várszínház was reopened on 13 February 1978, and was the home to the Népszínház until 1982, after which it was the chamber theatre of the National Theatre until 1 December 2001. From 2001, it is the home of the National Dance Theatre, thus being a theatre only in its name.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4724535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4724535", "title": "Cuban Spanish", "text": "Cuban Spanish\n\nCuban Spanish—also referred to colloquially as simply \"cubano\", or even \"cubañol\"— is the variety of the Spanish language as it is spoken in Cuba. As a Caribbean language variety, Cuban Spanish shares a number of features with nearby varieties, including coda deletion, seseo, and debuccalization (\"aspiration\").\n\nCharacteristic of Cuban Spanish is the weak pronunciation of consonants, especially at the end of a syllable. Syllable-final weakens to or disappears entirely; word-final becomes ; syllable-final may become or , or even become entirely silent. The fricative variants of , , (i.e. , , ) are also significantly weakened when occurring after a vowel: tends to disappear entirely, while and become weak approximants, with no friction at all and often barely audible as consonants. All of these characteristics occur to one degree or another in other Caribbean varieties, as well as in many dialects in Andalusia (in southern Spain)—the place of historical origin of these characteristics.\n\nOne of the most prominent features of Cuban Spanish is the debuccalization of in syllable coda. This trait is shared with most American varieties of Spanish spoken in coastal and low areas (\"Lowland Spanish\"), as well as with Canarian Spanish and the Spanish spoken in the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nTake for example, the following sentence:\n\nAlso, because may also be deleted in the syllable coda and because this feature has variable realizations, any or all instances of in the above example may be dropped, potentially rendering . Other examples: \"disfrutar\" (\"to enjoy\") is pronounced , and \"fresco\" (\"fresh\") becomes . In Havana, \"después\" (\"after[ward]\") is typically pronounced .\n\nAnother instance of consonant weakening (\"lenition\") in Cuban Spanish (as in many other dialects) is the deletion of intervocalic in the participle ending \"‑ado\", as in \"cansado\" \"tired\"). \nMore typical of Cuba and the Caribbean is the dissimilation of final in some verb infinitives; e.g. \"parar\", to stop, can be realized as .\n\nThe Spanish of the eastern provinces (the five provinces comprising what was formerly Oriente Province) is closer to that of the Dominican Republic than to the Spanish spoken in the western part of the island.\n\nCuban Spanish typically uses the diminutive endings \"-ico\" and \"-ica\" (instead of the standard \"-ito\" and \"-ita\") with stems that end in . For example, \"plato\" (\"plate\") > \"platico\" (instead of \"platito\"), and \"momentico\" instead of \"momentito\"; but \"cara\" (\"face\") becomes \"carita\". This form is common to the Venezuelan, Cuban, Costa Rican, Dominican, and Colombian dialects.\n\nThe suffix \"-ero\" is often used with a place name to refer to a person from that place; thus \"habanero\", \"guantanamera\", etc. A person from Santiago de Cuba is \"santiaguero\" (compare \"santiagués\" \"from Santiago de Compostela (Spain)\", \"santiaguino\" \"from Santiago de Chile\").\n\n\"Wh\"-questions, when the subject is a pronoun, are usually not inverted. Where speakers of most other varieties of Spanish would ask \"¿Qué quieres?\" or \"¿Qué quieres tú?\", Cuban speakers would more often ask \"¿Qué tú quieres?\" (This form is also characteristic of Dominican and Puerto Rican Spanish.)\n\nIn keeping with the socialist polity of the country, the term \"compañero/compañera\" (\"comrade\" or \"friend\") is often used instead of the traditional \"señor/señora\". (For a contrary view, see Corbett (2007: 137).) Similarly, Cuban Spanish uses the familiar second-person pronoun \"tú\" in many contexts where other varieties of Spanish would use the formal \"usted\". Voseo is practically non-existent in Cuba.\n\nCuban Spanish is most similar to, and originates largely from, the Spanish that is spoken in the Canary Islands and Andalusia. Cuba owes much of its speech patterns to the heavy Canarian migrations of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The accent of La Palma is the closest of the Canary Island accents to the Cuban accent. Many Cubans and returning Canarians settled in the Canary Islands after the revolution of 1959. Migration of other Spanish settlers (Asturians, Catalans, Galicians and Castilians) also occurred, but left less influence on the accent.\n\nMuch of the typical Cuban replacements for standard Spanish vocabulary stems from Canarian lexicon. For example, \"guagua\" ('bus') differs from standard Spanish \"autobús\". The word \"guagua\" originated in the Canaries and is an onomatopoeia stemming from the sound of a Klaxon horn. An example of Canarian usage for a Spanish word is the verb \"fajarse\" ('to fight'). In Spain, the verb would be \"pelearse\", and \"fajar\" exists as a non-reflexive verb related to the hemming of a skirt.\n\nMuch of the vocabulary that is peculiar to Cuban Spanish comes from the different historic influences on the island. Many words come from the Canary Islands, but some words are of West African, French, or indigenous Taino origin, as well as peninsular Spanish influence from outside the Canary Islands, such as Andalusian or Galician. American English has lent several words, including some for clothing, such as \"pulóver\" [sic] (which is used to mean \"T-shirt\") and \"chor\" (\"shorts\", with the typical Spanish change from English \"sh\" to \"ch\").\n\nTo speak to the elderly or to strangers, Cubans sometimes speak more formally as a sign of respect. They shake hands both on greeting and on leaving someone. Men often exchange friendly hugs (\"abrazos\"), and both men and women often greet friends and family with a hug and a kiss on the cheek.\n\nHowever Cubans tend to speak informally, such as by addressing a stranger with \"mi corazón\" (\"my heart\"), \"mi vida\" (\"my life\"), or \"cariño\" (\"dear\") are common. \"Mi amor\" (\"my love\") is used, even between strangers, when at least one of them is a woman (for example, in being served in a shop). Cubans are less likely to use the formal second-person singular pronoun \"usted\" to speak to a stranger, elder or superior. \"Tú\" is considered acceptable in all but very formal situations; regular use of the \"usted\" form can be seen by some Cubans as an affectation or a mark of coldness.\n\n\n\n"}

Dancing England was set up to showcase the best of traditional dance in the UK, along with unique and/or interesting folk customs to celebrate the UK's wide cultural heritage.\n\nIn 1979 Phil and John of Black Cap decided to hold a 'Feast' and invite the best dancers from across the UK as their guests, and so the idea of Dancing England was born.\n\nThe event was held in the evening and consisted of a series of performances by dance teams across all the styles of UK traditional dance; Cotswold Morris, Rapper sword, Longsword, North West, step clog dancing, Border, Molly, and much more. There were also performances by mummers and Pace Eggers, musicians and from some of the more idiosyncratic traditional teams; notably The Britannia Coconut Dancers, Abbotts Bromley Horn Dancers and the Whittlesey Straw Bear. There were stalls selling music, ephemera and crafts, films, workshops and talks. The event was refreshed with plenty of real ale, and finished with a ceilidh late at night.\n\n\nAfter Dancing England came to an end in 1987, there was a brief reprise in 1993 at the same venue for the Daughter of Dancing England event. This only ran for one year, and both Dancing England and Daughter of same were sadly missed.\n\nDancing England featured a rapper sword competition in the afternoon prior to the evening concert, in homage to the Newcastle Tournament of Music and Art which was held in the city from just after the Great War until the 1950s. Following the sad demise of Dancing England in 1987, the competition continued under the name of DERT and now travels around the country being hosted by a different rapper sword team every year.\n\n2019 - Nottingham Playhouse; Saturday 26th January 2019\n\n2017 - Sheffield City Hall; Saturday 18 February 2017.\n\n"}

In general, dogeza is translated into English as \"prostration\" or \"kowtow\".\n\nIn the Japanese social consciousness, the act of sitting on the ground and creating a scene (dogeza), is an uncommon deference only used when one is deviating greatly from daily behavior. It is seen as part of etiquette and filled with the feeling of being sorry about troubling the other person. By performing dogeza and apologizing to someone, usually the other person would have a tendency to forgive.\n\nIn the \"Gishiwajinden\" (魏志倭人伝), the oldest Chinese record of encounters with the Japanese, it was mentioned that commoners of the ancient Yamataikoku would, upon meeting noblemen along the road, fall prostrate on the spot, clapping their hands as in prayer (柏手 read: kashiwade), and this is believed to be an old Japanese custom.\n\nThe haniwa of the Kofun period can be seen prostrating themselves in dogeza.\n\nIn the early modern period, popularly as the \"daimyō\"s procession passed by, it is believed that it was mandatory for the commoners present to perform dogeza, but that is incorrect. It was normal for common people to perform dogeza in modern times when being interviewed by higher-ups.\n\nEven now, as a method of self-protection and apology in which damage to one's image is neglected, its idea of feeling shame remains firmly rooted.\n\n"}

Dwindling endowments from wealthy patrons forced some museums to make difficult and controversial decisions to deaccession artwork from their collections to gain funds, or in the case of the Rose Art Museum, to close the institution and sell the entire collection.\n\nSuch actions have prompted censure from Museum organizations such as the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council in the UK and the Association of Art Museum Directors in the US. These organizations charge that the actions of their members were in violation of not only their ethics code but also the core of their mission- to provide access to a fund of cultural heritage for future scholarship- by selling works to private buyers for purposes other than funding new acquisitions. Consideration of the dire financial state of these institutions, and the intensifying effect that any punitive action by an ethics organization will have on the finances of an individual museum, has fostered debate on the merits of deaccessioning.\n\nArt museums have struggled to meet their operating costs for years, especially as many have \"suggested donations\" rather than entrance fees, or have no entrance fees whatsoever, relying on endowments and membership dues. In 2006, this began to change at many museums: on 3 June 2006, the Art Institute of Chicago announced that its suggested donation of $12 would become mandatory, and in July of that year the Metropolitan Museum of Art raised its suggested admission fee from $15 to $20.\n\nOn 1 October 2007, the board of Randolph College decided to auction four works from its collection in order to raise funds for the college: \"Peaceable Kingdom\", by Edward Hicks; \"Men of the Docks\", by George Bellows; \"Through the Arroyo\", by Ernest Hennings; and \"Troubadour\", by Rufino Tamayo. The sale was halted in November when a court injunction against it was granted to a group of alumnae and others. When this coalition raised only half of the required one million dollar bond, the court lifted the injunction and the college proceeded to sell \"Troubador\" at Christie's in April 2008. The other paintings are currently held in a Christie's warehouse, to be sold when markets rebound.\n\nBy October 2008, museum directors could clearly see that the crisis would greatly affect the operation of their museums. After Lehman Brothers, a major corporate sponsor of the MOMA, filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, MOMA director Glenn D. Lowry was quoted as saying \"We know there’s a storm at sea and we know it’s going to hit land and it could get ugly\".\n\nOn 5 December 2008, the National Academy of Design announced that it had sold two canvases by Hudson River School painters for 13.5 million dollars in order to meet its operating costs: \"Mount Mansfield, Vermont\", by Sanford Robinson Gifford; and \"Scene on the Magdalene\", by Frederic Edwin Church. The decision drew criticism from the Association of Art Museum Directors, who strongly oppose deaccessioning to gain funds for any purpose other than acquiring art. The director of the Academy, Carmine Branagan, argued that because the Academy does not buy artwork but acquires pieces only through donations, the guideline should not apply.\n\nThe decision was made by the board of the Academy, which is composed of 16 prominent American artists such as Chuck Close, Jasper Johns, Frank Gehry, Wolf Kahn, and Helen Frankenthaler as well as 5 non-artist advisory board members. Some have attributed the poor financial state of the academy to its unusual leadership, as most museums are governed by professional administrators and curators.\n\nThe AAMD struck back, issuing an e-mail to its members ordering them not to loan works to the Academy or to collaborate with it on exhibitions. The apparent harshness of this reaction drew criticism from some quarters, such as Patty Gerstenblith, a law professor at DePaul University and author of \"Art, Cultural Heritage, and the Law\": \"If it’s a choice between selling a Rauschenberg and keeping the museum doors open, I think there’s some justification for selling the painting\". Others have supported the AAMD's decision, initiating a debate on the ethics of deaccessioning. According to Dan Monroe, director of the Peabody Essex Museum, \"The fact is as soon as you breach this principle, everybody’s got a hardship case. It would be impossible to control the outcome.\"\n\nOn 9 March 2009, representatives from the Academy and the AAMD met to discuss the Academy's financial future. The Academy agreed not to sell any more artworks, but there was no promise to lift sanctions on the part of the AAMD. They also agreed to change the composition of their board of directors: the new board will consist of 11 artist members and 10 non-artist members.\n\nOn 17 March 2009, a bill that would ban museums from selling artwork to meet operating costs was proposed by Richard Brodsky in the New York State Assembly. It would allow museums in New York State to use money from deaccessioned artwork only for the purposes of acquiring new art or for preserving works in the collection.\n\nIn December 2008 the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles reported that it had lost over $44 million of its $50 million endowment over nine years. The museum considered merging with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art but was approached by the billionaire Eli Broad, whose 30 million dollar bailout offer was accepted on December 23. Museum director Jeremy Strick also announced that he would resign.\n\nBrandeis University has drawn criticism after its 26 January 2009 surprise announcement that it would close the Rose Art Museum by the end of the summer. Several of the university's large donors were reportedly particularly hard hit due to investment with Bernard Madoff. Attorney general of Massachusetts Martha Coakley said that her office would conduct a detailed review of the decision.\n\nAfter general protest from students, faculty, and the Rose family, Brandeis announced that it would indeed not close the museum immediately, but instead form an eleven-person committee to discuss the future of the museum. However, Brandeis also released a statement on its website that the fate of the museum's collection was not within the scope of the committee, and that all museum staff jobs would be terminated on 30 June 2009.\n\nAs of 2011, the Rose Art Museum remains open, with a celebration of its 50-year anniversary and new renovations on October 27, 2011.\n\nIn February 2009, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced that it would be freezing staff hiring, and that 15 of its 23 satellite stores nationwide would be closed.\n\nIn August 2012, Fisk University in Nashville sold a 50% interest in 101 pieces, originally donated to the historically-black college in 1949 by Georgia O'Keeffe, to Crystal Bridges Museum (founded in Bentonville by Walmart heir Alice Walton) for $30 million. Each museum will display the pieces half the time.\n\nThe city of Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy on July 18, 2013 after many years of decline which included the 2009 Chapter 11 bankruptcy of GM and Chrysler. As the Detroit Institute of Arts is city-owned, state-appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr has sought an appraisal of billions of dollars of museum artwork.\n\nIn 2006, the town council of Bury made a controversial decision to sell \"A Riverbank\", by L. S. Lowry from the collection of the Bury Art Gallery and Museum for £1,408,000 at Christie's. This resulted in the museum's loss of accreditation by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, which condemned the decision. The decision also brought criticism from art collectors, such as Frank Cohen, who was quoted as saying \"People won't want to give things away to museums if they think they might be sold in future. If I give something away, I make it a condition that it is never sold.\"\nSimilarly, Northampton Museum and Art Gallery made the decision to sell an Egyptian Sekhemka statue to substantial controversy. The sale raised £16 Million for the Museum but resulted in a loss of its accreditation with the Arts Council England. See Northampton Sekhemka statue.\n"}

In modern fiction, the term has often been used for a certain kind of undead monster. \n\nBy extension, the word \"ghoul\" is also used in a derogatory sense to refer to a person who delights in the macabre, or whose profession is linked directly to death, such as a gravedigger or graverobber.\n\nGhoul is from the Arabic \"ghūl\", from \"ghāla\", \"to seize\". In Arabic, the term is also sometimes used to describe a greedy or gluttonous individual.\n\nThe term was first used in English literature in 1786, in William Beckford's Orientalist novel \"Vathek\", which describes the \"ghūl\" of Arabic folklore. This definition of the ghoul has persisted until modern times, with ghouls appearing in popular culture.\n\nIn the Arabic folklore, the \"ghūl\" is said to dwell in cemeteries and other uninhabited places. A male ghoul is referred to as \"ghūl\" while the female is called \"ghulah\". A source identified the Arabic ghoul as a female creature who is sometimes called Mother Ghoul (\"umm\" \"ghūla)\" or a relational term such as Aunt Ghoul. She is portrayed in many tales luring hapless characters, who are usually men, into her home where she can eat them.\n\nSome state that a ghoul is a desert-dwelling, shapeshifting demon that can assume the guise of an animal, especially a hyena. It lures unwary people into the desert wastes or abandoned places to slay and devour them. The creature also preys on young children, drinks blood, steals coins, and eats the dead, then taking the form of the person most recently eaten. One of the narratives identified a ghoul named Ghul-I-Beaban, a particularly monstrous character believed to be inhabiting the wilderness of Afghanistan and Iran.\n\nIt was not until Antoine Galland translated \"One Thousand and One Nights\" into French that the western idea of ghoul was introduced into European society. Galland depicted the ghoul as a monstrous creature that dwelled in cemeteries, feasting upon corpses. \n\nGhouls () also exist in Iranian folklore.\n"}

Some types of Greek lace include reticella, Roman lace, cutwork, Venetian guipure, and Greek point lace\n\nGreek lace was first made from 1480 to 1620, the designs being always a rigid geometrical type. Greek Lace was used in large quantities for the decoration of ecclesiastical vestments and cere cloths. The earliest types of Greek lace were created by straight lines buttoned over in repetition. In the beginning, Greek lace specimens were primarily formed in the simplest type of geometrical outlines. Originally, this lace was made from a tracing on parchment and then woven on a cushion in order to create the ornate pattern. As time passed and the process developed, greater variety of geometrical designs were created and shown in the lace. Patterns became more full, and the bars more ornate. The complex designs of the Greek lace were always formal and often arranged with excellent artistic effect. Geometrical outlines such as circles and triangles were slowly added to the lace to enhance its dimensions. The Ionian Islands are recognized as being the home to the creation of the Greek lace.\nReticella was mentioned in the Sforza Inventory in 1493, which spread the idea and technique even further. Other countries like Germany, France, Spain, Flanders, and England all made only a very limited extent of the Greek Lace, but it eventually was mocked and imitated, creating more types of lace. However, Greek lace became popular outside of the main manufacturing countries.\n\nBetween the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries, the term Greek lace may have originated from the time when the Ionian Islands were in the possession of the Venetian Republic. A true lace is created when a thread is looped, braided, or twisted to other threads independently from a fabric in one of 3 ways: (1) with a needle, when the work is distinctively known as “needlepoint lace” (2) with bobbins, pins on a pillow or cushion, when the work is known as ‘pillow lace” (3) by machinery. Originally, lace was made with linen, silk, gold, or silver threads, but now lace is often made with cotton thread.\nThere is no evidence to prove that Greek Lace was ever produced for commercial purposes in Greece. It is speculated that the term may have originated between the 15th and 18th century, when the Ionian Islands were under the rule of the Venetian Republic.\n\nIn modern day, Greek lace, or Reticella, is generally considered a furniture lace. Greek Lace is also used as decoration rather than clothing. Authentic Greek lace is now predominantly made in Italy. Modern Greek lace is made with flax thread only, rather than the silk that was originally used.\n\nMass production of lace is also common. While it is not authentic, the patterns often have resemblance to the geometric structures of Greek lace. Modern popular uses for lace are primarily for decoration and wedding attire. Due to its popularity, it became very widespread around the world and was modified to create other types of lace, modernly known as imitations.\n\nSince Greek lace is one of the earliest form of needle lace, there are many different variations that are difficult to distinguish. One of the biggest differentiations between different types of old Greek lace is whether it is “Italian or Flemish.” However, specimens have shown that there are no standard differences between the two. Very early Greek lace can be identified by lace trimmings. Authentic Greek lace is identified by the procedure of buttoning over the thread in specific patterns and can ideally be distinguished from others. When Greek lace is made by machine, it is made entirely differently. It is either woven, where two threads are used, or embroidered, when a pattern is embroidered onto something that is later removed.\n"}

Some upscale catalogues in Europe market it as a portmanteau from the French words Porter (carry) and Manteau (cloak).\n\nThe front hall was the introduction to the house, and as such was an important part of the Victorian home. Furnishings were selected not only to make it a useful place to hang a hat and coat, store an umbrella and leave a calling card, but also to show family wealth, social position and knowledge of current styles. A hall stand or a hatrack was the most important piece of furniture. These were new forms that appeared about 1840, as homes became larger and social visits became more structured; see also Hall Tree.\n\nUsually made of wood and standing at least tall, they have a single pole making up most of the height, with a sturdy base to prevent toppling, and an array of lengthy pegs at the top for placement of hats. Smaller houses had smaller front halls, so a hanging hatrack was the answer to the problem of storing visitors' coats and hats. The complicated shapes of the spindles and hooks of both varieties created an interesting pattern on the wall.\n\nBy the 1920s, houses had become smaller, and hall furnishings were usually just a chair, a table and perhaps a mirror - a closet or cupboard held hats and coats. \n\nIn breakdancing, the \"hatstand\" refers to the first part of a frozen headspin.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "794550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=794550", "title": "Homo sacer", "text": "Homo sacer\n\nHomo sacer (Latin for \"the sacred man\" or \"the accursed man\") is a figure of Roman law: a person who is banned and may be killed by anybody, but may not be sacrificed in a religious ritual. \n\nThe meaning of the term \"sacer\" in Ancient Roman religion is not fully congruent with the meaning it took after Christianization, and which was adopted into English as \"sacred\". In early Roman religion \"sacer\", much like the Hebrew \"qadoš\", denotes anything \"set apart\" from common society and encompasses both the sense of \"hallowed\" and that of \"cursed\". This concept of the sacred is more in line with the Islamic notion of \"haram\". The \"homo sacer\" could thus also simply mean a person expunged from society and deprived of all rights and all functions in civil religion. \"Homo sacer\" is defined in legal terms as someone who can be killed without the killer being regarded as a murderer; and a person who cannot be sacrificed. The sacred human may thus be understood as someone outside the law, or beyond it. With respect to certain monarchs, in certain western legal traditions, the concepts of the sovereign and of the Homo Sacer have been conflated.\n\nThe term \"sacred man\" could also have been used because the condemned could only rely on protection of gods.\n\nThe status of \"homo sacer\" could fall upon one as a consequence of oath-breaking. An oath in antiquity was essentially a conditional self-cursing, i.e. invoking one or several deities and asking for their punishment in the event of breaking the oath. An oathbreaker was consequently considered the property of the gods whom he had invoked and then deceived. If the oathbreaker was killed, this was understood as the revenge of the gods into whose power he had given himself. Since the oathbreaker was already the property of the oath deity, he could no longer belong to human society, or be consecrated to another deity.\n\nA direct reference to this status is found in the Twelve Tables (8.21), laws of the early Roman Republic written in the 5th century BC. The paragraph states that a patron who deceives his clients is to be regarded as \"sacer\".\n\nThe idea of the status of an outlaw, a criminal who is declared as unprotected by the law and can consequently be killed by anyone with impunity, persists throughout the Middle Ages. Medieval perception condemned the entire human intrinsic moral worth of the outlaw, dehumanizing the outlaw literally as a \"wolf\" or \"wolf's-head\" (in an era where hunting of wolves existed strongly, including a commercial element) and is first revoked only by the English \"Habeas Corpus\" act of 1679 which declares that any criminal must be judged by a tribunal before being punished.\n\nItalian philosopher Giorgio Agamben takes the concept as the starting point of his main work \"\" (1998).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31925499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31925499", "title": "I Married Wyatt Earp", "text": "I Married Wyatt Earp\n\nThe 1976 book I Married Wyatt Earp was published as a memoir of his widow Josephine Earp, but after 23 years as a best-selling non-fiction book, was described as a fraud, creative exercise, and a hoax. Originally published by the respected University of Arizona Press, it is the second best-selling book about western Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp ever sold. It was regarded for many years as a factual account that shed considerable light on the life of Wyatt Earp and his brothers in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. It was cited in scholarly works, assigned as classroom work, and used as a source by filmmakers. Amateur Earp historian Glenn Boyer said that the retouched image on the cover of a scantily-clad woman was of Josephine in her 20s, and based on his statements, copies of the image were later sold at auction for up to $2,875.\n\nBoyer had a long-term relationship with members of the Earp family. He claimed that he used two manuscripts written by Josephine Earp as the basis for the memoir. The first was an account, allegedly composed by Josephine with the help of former Tombstone Mayor and \"The Tombstone Epitaph\" publisher John Clum, known as the \"Clum manuscript\". The second, supposedly written by Josephine with the assistance of two Earp cousins, was known as the \"Cason manuscript\". Josephine fiercely protected details of her and Wyatt's early life in Tombstone, including her own life there and the existence of Wyatt Earp's second wife, Mattie Blaylock, even threatening litigation to keep some details private. Josephine was repeatedly vague about her and Wyatt's time in Arizona, so much so that the Earp cousins gave up collaborating with her and publishers refused to publish the manuscript.\n\nIn 1994, other Western researchers and rival authors of new Earp books identified alleged discrepancies in the book and began to challenge the authenticity of what they called the \"Clum manuscript\". They also claimed to have identified factual errors and inconsistencies in other books published by Boyer, leading to an increasing number of questions about the veracity of his work. The risque cover image was linked to a photogravure titled \"Kaloma\" that had been first published by a novelty company in 1914. A 1998 investigative article in the \"Phoenix New Times\" revealed that Boyer could not prove the Clum manuscript existed and refused to allow the reporter access to the source documentation. The article also disclosed that the university press' editor encouraged Boyer to embellish the account. During the interview, Boyer said that he had a responsibility to protect the reputation of the Earp brothers, and that he \"had a license to say any darned thing I please...[to] lie, cheat, and steal.\" Boyer found another publisher and continued to publish the work, representing it as an authentic history of Wyatt Earp's life.\n\nAfter the death of Wyatt Earp, Josephine Marcus Earp tried to get her own life story published. She sought the assistance of Wyatt's cousins Mabel Earp Cason and Cason's sister Vinola Earp Ackerman. The cousins recorded events in Josephine's life and found Josephine was generous with details about her life after Tombstone, but could not remember events before and while she lived in the town. The Cason manuscript the Earp cousins produced had a serious limitation: it was missing the family's most compelling and interesting story, the time while Josephine and Wyatt lived in Tombstone. Cason and her sister pressured Josephine to supply as much information about her time in Tombstone as she readily recalled about the rest of her life, but Josie resisted. She was very protective of her and Wyatt's image. She finally revealed only a few details, including that she had returned to Arizona when Johnny Behan promised to marry her, but was disillusioned when he continually put off the wedding.\n\nJosephine approached several publishers about the book, but backed out each time due to their insistence that she be completely open and forthcoming, rather than slanting her memories to her favor. Mable Earp Cason says she and her sister \"finally abandoned work on the manuscript because she would not clear up the Tombstone sequence where it pertained to her and Wyatt.\" When Josephine could not find a publisher, she changed her mind and asked the cousins to burn their work, but Cason held back a copy, which amateur historian Glenn Boyer eventually acquired the rights to.\n\nBoyer donated the original The Cason Manuscript to the University of Arizona, which is housed in a special collection and a second copy to the Ford County Historical Society. When Boyer presented the idea of publishing the manuscript to the University of Arizona, they insisted the book had to cover the period in Tombstone. Boyer produced a second, previously unknown and still unseen manuscript, that he said Josephine had worked on between 1929 and 1932 with the help of John Clum, a former editor of \"The Tombstone Epitaph\" newspaper. This became known as the \"Clum manuscript.\"\n\nThe University of Arizona Press published the book in 1976 under the title \"I Married Wyatt Earp: The Recollections of Josephine Sarah Marcus\". The copyright was issued in her name and her name was given as the author. A book published by a university press usually must meet a high standard. When it is sold as non-fiction, academics consider the university's approval sacrosanct.\n\nBoyer's book gained wide acceptance as a memoir written by Josephine and an accurate portrayal of her life with Wyatt Earp. The book was immensely popular for many years, capturing the imagination of people with an interest in western history, studied in classrooms, cited by scholars, and relied upon as factual by filmmakers. It became the university's fourth all-time best-selling book with 12 printings totaling more than 35,000 copies. It is the second-largest selling book about Wyatt Earp.\n\nBoyer in turn received wide recognition as the foremost authority on Wyatt Earp. Following on the success of \"I Married Wyatt Earp\", Boyer published over the next 30 years a stream of apparently well-researched and provocatively reasoned papers. He is responsible for the publication of Big Nose Kate's memoirs as well as the long-sought \"Flood Manuscript\" written with Wyatt Earp's direct input.\n\nFor many years, the book was accepted as a legitimate historical document and was cited by important works on Tombstone like \"And Die in the West\" by Paula Mitchell Marks, \"Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait\" by Karen Holliday Tanner, and Richard Maxwell Brown's social history of frontier law, \"No Duty to Retreat\" (Oxford, 1991). The book was even adopted as required reading in history classes. University of New Mexico history professor Paul Hutton, who has served as executive director of the Western History Association, noted in 1998 that the University of Arizona had been selling the book for 23 years as an individual's memoir and an important historical document.\n\nHowever, critics began to question Boyer's sources for the book in the 1990s. Stephen Cox, then director of the University of Arizona Press, told the \"Arizona Daily Star\" in July 1998 that he stood behind the authenticity of the book.\n\nAccording to an interview with Boyer in 2009, when he turned 85, his family had a long-standing relationship with the Earps. According to Boyer, his father was a janitor in a saloon owned by Josie and Wyatt in Nome, Alaska. The son of Wyatt's good friend George Miller, Bill Miller, married Estelle Edwards, the daughter of Wyatt's sister Adelia Earp Edwards. Boyer said Bill and Estelle became a second set of parents to him.\n\nWhen the Earp cousins attempted to write about Josephine's life in Tombstone, she was very evasive. Even when Wyatt was alive, she and her husband were very protective of their \"past\". Author Stuart N. Lake interviewed Earp eight times before his death and began writing his biography. Josie corresponded with Lake, and he insisted she attempted to influence what he wrote and hamper him in every way possible, including consulting lawyers. Josie claimed she was striving to protect Wyatt Earp's legacy. She successfully prevented her name from being mentioned in Lake's book \"Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal\", and there is reason to believe that Lake avoided including her because she threatened legal action. As an unmarried woman in frontier Tombstone without visible means of support, perhaps an actress and a dancer, vastly outnumbered by men, if she had not been a prostitute, she undoubtedly was regarded by some as one.\n\nKit Scheifele, who was the original editor of Boyer's book for the University of Arizona Press, noticed that Boyer had removed wording from his original introduction to the book that made it clear \"that the manuscript you have presented is not solely the first-person writing of Mrs. Earp, and that you have written a first-person account based on her memoirs and other material as well.\" She asked him to restore the content, but Boyer ignored her request. Karen Thure, who prepared the book for publication, questioned Boyer's sources from the beginning. She asked to see copies of the Clum manuscript more than once, and Boyer refused each time. \"Glenn put a lot of Glenn in there. Glenn's theories appeared as Josie's,\" she said. \"I think it's a shame that anyone took \"I Married Wyatt Earp\" literally,\" she says. \"It's somewhere between history and historical fiction.\"\n\nBoyer claimed to possess the so-called Clum manuscript. He said it contained details of Wyatt and Josie's life in Tombstone that was missing from the story she wrote with the Earp cousins. Boyer said that the Clum manuscript had been written by \"The Tombstone Epitaph\" publisher John Clum based on conversations with Josephine. But Boyer confused readers and critics when he changed the story behind the origins of the manusccript.\n\nIn 1977, Boyer published a pamphlet, \"Trailing an American Myth,\" in which he stated that the Clum manuscript was actually written by several authors. He wrote that their work formed \"the basis of the Tombstone years in \"I Married Wyatt Earp\" and \"the Ten Eyck Papers in \"Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta.\"\" In the same year, Boyer wrote and published another pamphlet, \"Who Killed John Ringo?\" It stated that fiction writers Dashiell Hammett, Wilson Mizner, Rex Beach and Walt Coburn had written a portion of the manuscript documenting Josephine' Tombstone years. When questioned about the origins of the Clum manuscript during the early 1980s, Boyer changed his story to say that he did not receive the Clum manuscript from Colyn after all, instead it was given to him by one of Earp's nieces, Jeanne Cason Laing in 1967. \n\nWhen asked if these were all the same manuscript, Boyer replied, \"Some of them are a manuscript. Some are only a mishmash, as a matter of fact... The earlier ones of those guys all lean heavily on Clum and Parsons for insights, which is one of the reasons they got in trouble with Josephine Earp... This is a broad way when I say I refer to a Clum manuscript, for example. It is a broad way of referring to something when really this is nobody's business in a way.\"\n\nIn addition to the manuscript written by Clum, Boyer said he had a copy of a manuscript that Josephine prepared with the help of two of her husband's cousins, Mabel Earp Cason and her sister Vinolia Earp Ackerman. Wyatts' cousins pressed her for details about her personal life before and while living in Tombstone, but she was evasive. Josephine wanted to keep her and Wyatt Earp's tarnished history associated with Tombstone private and sanitize anything that could be seen negatively. Josephine finally consented to tell them that upon returning to Arizona, she believed Johnny Behan was going to marry her, and was disappointed and disillusioned when he repeatedly delayed the wedding. In her version of events, she said years later that she lived with a lawyer while working as a housekeeper for Behan and his ten-year-old son, Albert. \n\nSeeking more information, Boyer contacted Virgil Earp's granddaughter Mable Earp Cason only to learn she had died. Based on his reputation and success with his prior book on Earp, her daughter Jeanne Cason Laing cooperated with Boyer. She sifted through years of material her mother had collected during resulting from three attempts by her mother Mabel's and aunt Vinnolia's attempt to write a biography of Josephine Earp. This included drafts and notes from their first attempt at collaborating with Josephine during the 1930s, which was part of something that Jeanne called \"the Clum manuscript\". Mabel also had collected materials and letters during 1955, when she made another attempt to get the work published, and corresponded with Earp historian John Gilchriese and the publishing house Houghton Mifflin. She has also collected clippings and correspondence with researchers during the mid-1960s. They loaned him \"a stack of material almost a foot high.\"\n\nBoyer argues that she actually lived with Behan. Boyer warns readers of \"her 'little-old-lady' attempts to tell only the decorous and proper.\" Interviewers said she was often \"difficult\" to interview.\n\nBoyer interviewed her and other family members, gleaning details of Josephine's life, and received additional documents and photographs. He said the documents contributed \"to the overall fabric of Josie's story were undoubtedly made by former Tombstone mayor and Earp friend John Clum,\" but that \"some Earp researchers got hung up on this 'manuscript' business.\"\n\nBoyer said he merged the Clum and Cason manuscripts, \"which contained vastly different materials presented in widely different styles.\" To bolster the authenticity of the book, Boyer pointed to affidavits and letters from the Cason family. Virgil Earp's great-granddaughter Jeanne Cason Laing had provided Boyer with the collection of papers that included the source materials for the Clum manuscript in 1967. In a September 21, 1983 statement, Laing wrote, \"I believe the book edited by Mr. Boyer is \"bona fide\" in its entirety and is remarkably accurate in its portrayal of Mrs. Earp's character and personality.\"\n\n\"My mother and Aunt were aware of the earlier 'Clum' manuscript covering the Tombstone years, and for that reason were willing to burn that portion of their manuscript at Mrs. [Josephine] Earp's request. My aunt had written that portion.\" Laing was not a historian or writer and had not cataloged the material. She had not seen the so-called Clum manuscript and relied on Boyer's word as to its authenticity. Although the exact contents of stack of materials Laing gave Boyer are unknown, Jeanne Cason Laing and other members of her family insisted that Josephine had started a manuscript with John Clum.\n\nJack Burrows, who wrote \" John Ringo, The Gunfighter Who Never Was\", said, \"How can he just take a stack of material and give it a name that has nothing to do with what's included? You can take a cowpie and call it filet mignon, but somebody's going to catch on during dinner. This is just gobbledygook.\"\n\nVirgil's great-grand-niece Alice Greenberg found a collection of type-written pages along with a sketch of the gunfight of the O.K. corral. The manuscript turned out to be the long-missing Flood manuscript and the sketch had been drawn by Wyatt Earp from memory.\n\nThe Clum manuscript was apparently Boyer's name for the materials given him by Laing, which include a collection of notes, newspaper accounts, memorabilia, and the written recollections of relatives, plus other materials he had acquired over many years. Boyer said that he \"often used my knowledge of Josie when using dialogue so she could tell her tale, the way she wanted.\" He insisted that his knowledge of her life was \"fortified by my written, taped and oral research,\" and that it didn't matter if \"the details Josie gave in her memoirs are correct.\" Using the collection and his personal knowledge, he wrote his synthesized version of Marcus' life in Tombstone as if the words were Josephine's. Boyer also made several errors in the process.\n\nOne inconsistency noted by other researchers is the account of Warren Earp's death. Josephine allegedly wrote in \"I Married Wyatt Earp\" how Wyatt returned to Arizona to avenge Warren Earp's July 6, 1900 killing. However, on June 29, 1900, the \"Nome Daily News\" reported that Wyatt had been arrested for \"interfering with an officer while in the discharge of his duty ... Earp, upon reaching the barracks, asserted that his action had been misconstrued, and that he had intended to assist the deputy marshal.\" Other references to him in the newspaper placed him in Alaska for the next several weeks. There was no way for Wyatt to get to Arizona in the time available.\n\nBoyer's Josephine cites an article from the Tombstone \"Weekly Nugget\" of March 19, 1881—an article that smeared Earp's friend Doc Holliday by implicating him in a botched stagecoach robbery. \"Doc's implication in this robbery through the propaganda of...the Nugget,\" she writes, \"led straight to the Earps' shootout with the rustlers some six months later.\" But author Casey Tefertiller studied the \"Nugget\" microfiche and could not find a reference to Holliday. After further research, he suggested that Boyer had made a gaffe common to Earp researchers—he had lifted a confabulated version of the Nugget article from Billy Breakenridge's 1928 book, \"Helldorado: Bringing the Law to the Mesquite\".\n\nAs the severity of Boyer's inventions became more widely known, Laura Cason, the granddaughter of Mable Earp Cason who helped author the Cason Manuscript, issued a statement that said, \"Mr. Boyer now claims that \"I Married Wyatt Earp\" is creative non-fiction when he has always led our family to believe it as a true account and memoir of Josephine Earp.\" In February 2000, when the controversy over the book became widely known, she formally asked Boyer to return the Cason manuscript, stating that they had always intended to only loan the material to him. \"We are saddened to learn that Mr. Boyer has seemingly manipulated Cason family members over the years in an apparent effort to provide authentication when questions arose.\" Boyer reacted by threatening a lawsuit and said that younger members of the Earp descendants were motivated by greed. The younger Cason family members were never successful in any of their efforts to gain ownership of the manuscript. Boyer donated a copy of the manuscript, along with other materials, to the Dodge City Historical Society, but retained the right to only allow individuals he authorized to see the documents.\n\nBoyer published \"I Married Wyatt Earp\" with a picture on the cover of a woman wearing a sheer gauze peignoir, re-touched to conceal her breasts and nipples. He insisted that the picture of the partially nude woman was Josephine when she was young, and that Johnny Behan took the photo of her in Tombstone in 1880.\n\nOnce the image appeared on the cover of the book, and due to the book cover attribution, copies of the portrait of \"Josephine Earp\" began to sell for hundreds and later thousands of dollars. Citations in auction catalogs and from dealer sales, all after the 1976 publication of \"I Married Wyatt Earp\", were regularly used for a number of years to \"verify\" that the image was Josie Earp. On December 6, 1996 the image, represented as a picture of Josephine Earp, was offered by H. C. A. Auctions in Burlington, North Carolina and sold for USD $2,750.\n\nDon Ackerman wrote \"Maine Antique Digest\" in April 1997 questioning the authenticity of the image sold at auction. Bob Raynor of the magazine acknowledged that H. C. A., after researching the image, had represented it as being Josie Earp. He noted that \"Both Sotheby's and Swann Galleries identified and sold the photo image in 1996, both auctions prior to the December HCA auction.\" Raynor stated, \"Please note that the image was used as a dust cover of the book \"I Married Wyatt Earp\", published by University of Arizona Press, 1976. Additionally, the image was used in another book, \"Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta\", published by Talei, and also in \"Pioneer Jews\", Houghton Mifflin, 1984. In all instances the image was identified as Josephine Earp.\" However, all these sources postdate and rely on Boyer's use of the image on the cover of the book. On April 8, 1998, Sotheby's sold another copy of the image for $2,875.\n\nHowever, the first known published image of the photograph of the beautiful young woman boldly posing for the camera wearing a sheer gauze peignoir was circulated in 1914. Labeled \"Kaloma,\" it was originally produced as an art print. The risqué image was popular and sold well. At the bottom right of the uncropped, original image is printed, \"COPYRIGHT 1914-P N CO.\" The image was copyrighted and circulated by the Pastime Novelty Company of 1313 Broadway, New York, New York. The image was used in the same year on the cover of \"Kaloma, Valse Hesitante\" (\"Hesitation Waltz\"), composed by Gire Goulineaux and published by the Cosmopolitan Music Publishing Company in New York City. It was used as a pin-up image during World War I.\n\nMost of the early Kaloma images seen to date are photogravures, a type of high-quality reproduction that has been produced since the 1850s, with a surge in popularity between 1890 and 1920. A photogravure is made from an engraving plate on a printing press, making them much less costly than actual photographs. Photogravures were often printed with title and publication data below the image and were commonly used to create many copies of high quality illustrations for books, postcards and art magazines.\n\nThe image regained popularity in the 1960s. One of the great rock poster designers of the time, Alton Kelley with Family Dog Productions in Haight Ashbury, made the image of the semi-nude woman as the centerpiece of his classic concert poster for Vanilla Fudge and The Charles Lloyd Quartet when they appeared at the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco September 29-October 1, 1967.\n\nNo evidence has been found that links the picture to Josephine before Boyer's book was published in 1976, and no primary sources have been found that link the photo to Josephine's time in Tombstone. Many individuals share similar facial features and faces on people who look radically different can look similar when viewed from certain angles. Because of this, most museum staff, knowledgeable researchers and collectors require provenance or a documented history for an image to support physical similarities that might exist. Experts will rarely offer even a tentative identification of new or unique images of famous people based solely on similarities shared with other known images.\n\nAn analysis of the photograph shows that the fashion and hair style of the young woman are not from the 1880s time frame, but from the early 20th Century. If the 1914 copyright date is the year the picture was taken, Josephine Earp would have been 53 in 1914. Casey Terfertiller's book \"Wyatt Earp The Life Behind the Legend\" contains a picture of an elderly Josephine Marcus Earp on page 225. The photo is from the Robert G. McCubbin Collection and has been verified as authentic. The date of the photograph is estimated at about 1921. Josephine is elderly and very plump. This contrasts sharply with the alleged 1914 photo of a very young, thin and buxom \"Josie\".\n\nOn November 26, 1997, Dave McKenna of ABC Novelty Company, the successor to the original company that produced the image, wrote \"I will confirm that this photo was copyrighted under the ABC name in 1914. In our warehouse we have a thousand similar photos of nude woman that we used and still use. My understanding is that the photographs were taken in New York or Boston.\"\n\nBoyer responded to criticism of the validity of the image by offering to sell proof in a booklet available from his company, \"Historical Research Associates\" operated out of his home in Rodeo, New Mexico. When asked directly about the authenticity of the image in 2009, he replied, \"Actually the publisher made the decision for the cover. My take? If it's not her, it ought to be.\"\n\nSeveral Western researchers have uncovered a pattern in Boyer's publications of inventing not only sources but fictional individuals who supply insight and perspective into real events and people. Jack Burrows wrote that Boyer \"has published three different memoirs telling how Wyatt Earp killed Ringo, all giving different stories.\" Boyers justified the three different stories as representing three different person's perspectives. The \"Phoenix New Times\" reported in a lengthy investigative article that \"Fiction appears to infuse much of his historical writings.\"\n\nBoyer's first book, \"An Illustrated History of Doc Holliday\", was published in 1966. Boyer wrote ten years later that he purposefully attempted to mislead others. Bogus photos of 'Perry Mallon,' 'Johnny Tyler,' and Doc's cousin 'Mattie Holliday' were inserted into a fabricated story about Doc and Wyatt killing Mallon and Tyler in Colorado. The picture of Mattie Holliday was a photograph of Boyer's father's cousin. Boyer was also criticized for planting allegedly bogus letters that he said came from descendants of a Texas friend of Doc's called \"Peanut,\" a pseudonym for an anonymous and unknown individual.\n\nBob Palmquist, an attorney and avid Earp researcher, worked with Boyer for several years. He said that Boyer intended to write \"Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta\" as \"...a novel in the style of a memoir as if somebody was actually telling the story, in this case Ted Ten Eyck.\" Boyer told other versions about the origins of Ted Ten Eyck, saying he had received a new manuscript from Earp family members, that the story was based on the unpublished memoir of a newspaper journalist who was present in Tombstone while the Earps were lawmen, and that he had used Ten Eyck as a literary device and the book was in the form of a \"non-fiction novel.\" In a 1977 interview he altered his description of the newspaperman once again. He said, \"I am Ten Eyck. I'm the literary artist that created the composite figure that I chose to call Ten Eyck.\"\n\nBoyer responded to criticism saying he had an artistic license. His credibility was questioned, while his unwillingness or inability to provide researchers with evidence led the University to re-assess the book.\n\nIn an interview in 1999, the university's current president Peter Likins described the book as having a \"fictional format.\" Although Likens admitted he had not read the book, he said the book states that it isn't a first-person account but a blend of secondary sources. The epilogue says that it is a memoir based on Josephine Earp's own writing. Likins characterized the disagreements about the book's authenticity as a squabble between non-academic authors hoping to promote different interpretations of Western history. It might take years, Likins said, for scholars to decide which version of Earp events was correct. During his investigation of Boyer's work, reporter Tony Ortega found that \"the University of Arizona Press not only knew his sources were suspect, but they encouraged him to embellish.\" Marshall Townsend, Director of the University of Arizona Press when Boyer's book was published, actively discouraged two editors from questioning Boyer, and repeatedly encouraged him to put \"more of yourself\" into the book.\n\nAuthor Andrew Albanese wrote that \"historians agree that the press has put its integrity on the line by allowing Boyer's bogus Tombstone account to enter the mainstream of Western history under the imprimatur of a scholarly press.\" In 1999, the University of Arizona Press director said they would reissue the book with a redesigned cover and alter the cover copy to make it clearer that the author was Glenn Boyer and not Josephine Earp. Hutton said that the university's decision to claim that the book is partly fiction after 23 years \"is essentially foisting a fraud upon the public.\"\n\nWhen confronted with allegations that his book was a hoax, Boyer said he had been misunderstood. \"My work is beginning to be recognized by all but a few fanatics and their puppets as a classic example of the newly recognized genre 'creative non-fiction.'\" Boyer compared his work to Pulitzer Prize winning author Edmund Morris, who wrote \"Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan\". Professor Donna Lee Brien wrote that in his \"confused defence\" Boyer failed to differentiate between his actions, collecting and blending primary source documents with his own fictionalized accounts, and Morris's very \"experimental biography which transparently acknowledged his inclusion of clearly recognisably fictional passages into traditionally sourced and referenced text.\" She noted that \"...as soon as Boyer invented source manuscripts, fabricated elements of the story and presented his own speculations as historical fact, he was not writing creative nonfiction but historical fiction—that is, fiction based on historical events.\"\n\nIn early 2000 the University refused to comment about the book and referred all questions to university lawyers. On January 29, 2000, Boyer posted a note on Amazon.com that he intended to take back the rights to the book. In March the University of Arizona Press announced they had released all rights to the book, removed the book from their catalog, and returned unsold copies to Boyer. Boyer claimed he decided to drop publication because he was disappointed with the university's handling of movie rights. Boyer found a small non-academic publisher, shortened the title to \"I Married Wyatt Earp\", and shifted authorship to his own name.\n\nBoyer has admitted that the book is \"100 percent Boyer.\" He said that he is uninterested in what others think of the accuracy of what he has written. \"This is an artistic effort. I don't have to adhere to the kind of jacket that these people are putting on me. I am not a historian. I'm a storyteller.\" Boyer said the book was not really a first-person account, that he had interpreted Wyatt Earp in Josephine's voice, and admitted that he couldn't produce any documents to vindicate his methods.\n\nBoyer admitted that two other books he had written, \"An Illustrated Life of Doc Holliday\" (Reminder Press, 1966), and \"Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta\", (Talie, 1993) were not based on the documents he claimed to have used. He followed the last book with a fourteen-part series in \"True West\" magazine titled \"Wyatt Earp, Legendary American\". Boyer responded to continuing questions about his sources and allegations of fraud, claiming that because of his close connection to the Earp family, he \"had a license to say any darned thing I please for the purpose of protecting the reputation of the Earp Boys, which I committed myself to do. I can lie, cheat, and steal, and figuratively ambush, antagonize, poison wells, and all of the others [sic] things that go with a first class Vendetta, even a figurative one.\"\n\nProfessor of Western history Gary Roberts wrote that Earp researchers are burdened with discriminating between Boyer fact and Boyer fiction. \"By passing off his opinions and interpretations as primary sources, he has poisoned the record in a way that may take decades to clear.\" Boyer's work is so enmeshed into the literature that if it is discredited virtually everything written since \"I Married Wyatt Earp\" was published is suspect to the extent that its conclusions are based on material drawn from Boyer.\n\nThe book has become an example of how supposedly factual works can trip up the public, researchers, and librarians. It was described by the \"Annual Review of Information Science and Technology\" in 2006 as a \"creative exercise\" and hoax. Other authors agreed that the book cannot be relied on.\n\nGlenn Boyer's contributions to Wyatt Earp studies were widely regarded, but doubts raised by \"Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta\" seriously damaged his credibility. Author Gary Roberts, a Western historian, noted, \"History is what's suffered the most. It's all kind of tragic really.\" Allen Barra, author of \"Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends\", believes that \"I Married Wyatt Earp\" is now recognized by Earp researchers as a hoax. Casey Tefertiller, a long-time critic of Boyer and the author of \"Wyatt Earp: The Life Behind the Legend\", agreed. \"This may be the most remarkable literary hoax in American history. It has been believed and accepted as the words of Josephine Earp for twenty-three years now.\" Tefertiller's book was one of the very few that didn't use any of Boyer's work as a source. Boyer commented, \"Writing about Earp and failing to mention me and my work is something like writing about Catholicism and neglecting to mention the Pope.\"\n\nA 1983 television movie based on the book was directed by Michael O'Herlihy, starring Marie Osmond as Josie Marcus, Bruce Boxleitner as Wyatt Earp, and John Bennett Perry as John Behan.\n\nBased in part on Boyer's work, the all-female musical \"I Married Wyatt Earp\" was written and performed beginning in 2006 at the Bristol Riverside Theatre in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. It was produced off-Broadway in 2011.\n"}

{"id": "5815068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5815068", "title": "Isabelline (architectural style)", "text": "Isabelline (architectural style)\n\nThe Isabelline style, also called the Isabelline Gothic (in Spanish, \"Gótico Isabelino\"), or Castilian late Gothic, was the dominant architectural style of the Crown of Castile during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon in the late-15th century to early-16th century. The Frenchman Émile Bertaux named the style after Queen Isabella.\n\nIt represents the transition between late Gothic and early Renaissance architecture, with original features and decorative influences of the Castilian tradition, the Flemish, the Mudéjar, and to a much lesser extent, Italian architecture. The consideration or not of the Isabelline as a Gothic or Renaissance style, or as an Eclectic style, or as a phase within a greater Plateresque generic, is a question debated by historians of art and unresolved. \n\nThe Isabelline style introduced several structural elements of the Castilian tradition and the typical Flanders's flamboyant forms, as well as some ornaments of Islamic influence. Many of the buildings that were built in this style were commissioned by the Catholic Monarchs or were in some way sponsored by them. A similar style called Manueline developed concurrently in Portugal. The most obvious characteristic of the Isabelline is the predominance of heraldic and epigraphic motifs, especially the symbols of the yoke and arrows and the pomegranate, which refer to the Catholic Monarchs. Also characteristic of this period is ornamentation using beaded motifs of orbs worked in plaster or carved in stone.\n\nAfter the Catholic Monarchs had completed the Reconquista in 1492 and started the colonization of the Americas, imperial Spain began to develop a consciousness of its growing power and wealth, and in its exuberance launched a period of construction of grand monuments to symbolize them. Many of these monuments were built at the command of the Queen; thus Isabelline Gothic manifested the desire of the Spanish ruling classes to display their own power and wealth. This exuberance found a parallel expression in the extreme profusion of decoration which has been called Plateresque.\n\nReferences to classical antiquity in the architecture of Spain were more literary, whereas in Italy, the prevalence of Roman-era buildings had given 'Gothic' a meaning adapted to Italian classicist taste. Until the Renaissance took hold in the Iberian peninsula, the transition from the 'Modern' to the 'Roman' in Spanish architecture had hardly begun. These terms were applied with a meaning different from what one would expect now— the 'Modern', an originally Spanish style, referred to the Gothic and its rational efficiency, while the 'Roman' was the neoclassical or emotional and sensualist style of the Italian Renaissance.\n\nRegardless of the spatial characteristics of the interiors, Gothic buildings utilized proven structural systems. The Gothic style in the Iberian Peninsula had undergone a series of changes under the influence of local tradition, including much smaller windows which allowed the construction of roofs with substantially less pitch and even flat roofs. This made for a truly original style, yet more efficient construction. Spanish architects, accustomed to their Gothic structural conventions, looked with some contempt on the visible metal braces that Italian architects were forced to put on their buildings' arches to resist horizontal thrust, while their own Gothic building methods had avoided this problem.\n\nThe development of classical architecture in the Iberian Peninsula, as elsewhere, had been moribund during the centuries of building construction done in the Gothic tradition, and the neoclassical movement of the Italian Renaissance was late to arrive there. A unique style with modern elements evolved from the Gothic inheritance in Spain. Perhaps the best example of this syncretistic style is the Monastery of San Juan de los Reyes in Toledo; designed by the architect Juan Guas, its Gothic ideals are expressed more in the construction than in the design of the interior space, as the relationship with original French Gothic building techniques had receded with the passage of time.\n\nIn the Isabelline style, decorative elements of Italianate origin were combined with Iberian traditional elements to form ornamental complexes that overlaid the structures, while retaining many Gothic elements, such as pinnacles and pointed arches. Isabelline architects clung to the Gothic solution of the problem of how to distribute the weight burden of vaults pressing on pillars (not on the walls, as in the Romanesque or Italian Renaissance styles): that is, by propping them up with flying buttresses. After 1530, although the Isabelline style continued to be used and its decorative ornaments were still evolving, Spanish architecture began to incorporate Renaissance ideas of form and structure.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28104886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28104886", "title": "James Thomas Hooper", "text": "James Thomas Hooper\n\nJames Thomas Hooper (1 September 1897 – 9 February 1971) was a British collector of ethnographic artifacts of the Inuit, Native American, Oceanic and African peoples.\n\nHooper was born in North Wraxall-Wiltshire in 1897 and began collecting in 1912 when his father gave him a native spear. He became an employee of the Thames Conservancy Board but collecting was his obsession. He scoured flea markets and small antique shops in rural England for items of interest as well as purchasing from auction houses, private museums and house sales. He also organised exchanges with other dealers and collectors such as William Ockelford Oldman and Kenneth Athol Webster.\n\nAt the height of his collecting in the 1950s, he was one of the top four collectors of pacific ethnographic material in the United Kingdom. Others included Kenneth Athol Webster and William Ockelford Oldman. Hooper's interest in collecting this material was ethnological rather than aesthetic. Like Oldman, Hooper never left Great Britain to visit the cultures that created the material he enjoyed.\n\nAfter his retirement, Hooper opened the Totems Museum in Arundel, Sussex, United Kingdom in a two-story building on the High Street. He ran this museum between 1957 and 1963. The ground-floor rooms were packed full of his ethnographic collection while he and his grandson, Steven Hooper, lived in the rooms above. The British Pathe newsreel film dated 9 December 1957 follows a couple visiting the Totems Museum. While the film gives little information when describing the treasures of the museum, close attention to the background and general shots of the interior of the museum give an excellent insight into the size, diversity and quality of Hooper's collection.\n\nIn 1954, he co-authored the publication \"The Art of Primitive Peoples\" with Cottie Arthur Burland. In it, Hooper concentrates on the art of Polynesia, Melanesia, North Coast of America, Eskimo, West Africa and the Congo. His text is illustrated with 116 photographs of items from his collection taken by R.H. Bomback. Soon after the opening of the Totems Museum, he published a guide booklet titled \"The Totems Museum, High Street, Arundel, Sussex : exhibiting the Hooper Collection of primitive art from Africa, the Pacific islands, New Zealand and the Americas\". This was also illustrated. The Hooper Collection was also documented through photography as Hooper allowed visitors and researchers to photograph his collections. Photographs of works from his collection can be found in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nHooper's collection continued to be documented after his death in 1971. His collection was the subject of a book by his grandson Steven Phelps – now known as Steven Hooper. \"Art and Artifacts of the Pacific, Africa and the Americas: The James Hooper Collection\" was published in 1976 and featured 250 illustrations. Soon after this book was published, parts of the collection began to be auctioned by Christie's. Between 1976 and 1982 there were at least six auctions of material from the James Hooper Collection. The auctions included \"African Art from the James Hooper Collection\" held on 14 July 1976 at Christie's London, \"American Indian Art from the James Hooper Collection\" held on 9 Nov 1976 at Christie's London, \"Hawaiian and Maori Art from the James Hooper Collection\" held on 21 June 1977 at Christie's London, \"Melanesian and Polynesian Art from the James Hooper Collection\" held on 19 June 1979 at Christie's London, \"Oceanic Art From the James Hooper Collection\" held on 17 June 1980 at Christie's London. and \"Important Tribal Art\" held on 7 July 1982 at Christie's London.\n\nMuseums around the world now own items from the James Hooper collection, either as a result of successful bidding at these auctions or through the generosity of other successful bidders.

On the show, Kid 'n Play were portrayed as teenagers, but their recording careers remained the same as in real life, as did their character traits. Production was by Marvel Productions and Saban Entertainment.\n\nThe real Kid 'n Play appeared in live-action wraparounds of the cartoons, but voice actors took over for the animated versions of the duo. The show stressed positive role models, teaching children how to get along with each other and stay out of trouble. Akin to the \"House Party\" films, Play was the less responsible member of the duo, cooking up get rich quick schemes, while Kid, the more responsible member, would usually be made to clean up messes. Oftentimes the issue would be resolved by the characters' girlfriends, or sometimes by an elderly jazz musician who wore a blue beret and was aptly named \"Old Blue\". The lessons ranged from serious to lighter fare. One of the \"less serious\" episodes dealt with Kid's father not understanding hip-hop and Kid not having the means to put it in a positive light, and Old Blue offers to help to sending Kid on a trip back in time to the era of jazz and speakeasies to help better understand its roots.\n\nIn 1992, Marvel Comics published a comic book based on the cartoon. The comic book ran for nine issues.\n\nThe series was created by John Semper Jr. and Cynthia Friedlob who also served as the show-runners and head-writers.

He rose to fame in 1968 when he was awarded a prize by the Hankook newspaper for his poem \"Sound of a Loom\". In 1970 Kim won another prize with the Seoul Daily newspaper for his poem \"Drowned Dreams\". He is considered one of the most significant modern Korean poets.\n\nKim grew up in extreme poverty. He graduated with a degree in Korean Literature from \"Sorabol University of Arts\" in Seoul in 1970. In 1997 and 1998 he lectured poetry at PyeongTaek University. He is a member of the Society of Korean Poets and the Korean Writers Association. Among the many prizes Kim has won are the \"Dong-Joo Yoon Literary Prize\" (1990), the \"Nam-Myung Literary Prize\" (1992), the \"Pyun-Woon Literary Prize\" (1993) and the \"Jeong Jeong Jiyong Literature Prize(2001)\".\n\nKim's first publications generally explored basic human emotions. These are sometimes thought to be typical of Korean poetry. Basic emotions include: disappointment, sorrow, parting, illness, or grief. These emotions are considered \"basic\" since everyone naturally lives through these emotions as part of their life. This close relationship with everyday life, as well as the subtlety of the emotions are not only a characteristic of Korean poetry, but particularly of Kim Jong-Chul. Kim is considered exceptionally talented at moving the reader's heart when writing about these basic emotions. There are critics who argue that this talent can be explained with Kim's biography which includes extreme poverty and growing up in war time. Because he was poor, Kim joined the army to serve in the Vietnam War voluntarily.\n\nHe continuously showed an interest in themes such as desperation, death, or poverty. Kim distanced himself from these motifs in his second collection of poetry, which had a more light-hearted approach to life matters.\n\nIn his third collection, Kim returned to darker motifs. This can be explained by Korea's long experience of military dictatorships between the 1960s and 1980s. He describes this time as \"a period of universal tragedy.\" With the coming of the 1990s, the political atmosphere in Korea changed. This was also reflected in some of Kim's poems. It seemed impossible to describe all life in terms of misery and tragedy. Kim continued to recognize the matter in trivial things. He frequently chooses the most mundane objects, such as a pumpkin, a nail or even a grain of rice.\n\nHis attitude is often linked with Kim's Roman Catholic faith. It is argued that this drives the author to search for the deeper meaning in everything, even if it appears trivial or insignificant. He hints at this in the preface of his fourth collection of poetry. There are some attempts to link his poems with Christian symbols, but this is frowned upon by others.\n\nKim gives profound meaning to everyday objects. It is this giving meaning to ordinary objects that some people regard as a special ability of Kim Jong-Chul. Kim argues that there is no meaning in the objects themselves: \"If all humanity were to disappear from this earth, a diamond would be nothing but a stone.\" This involvement with philosophical questions, such as of meaning, is often considered a departure from his earlier works. However, this also helped Kim to be viewed as one of the finest Korean poets of recent times.\n\nKim has published a number of poetry collections:\nIn collaboration with the literary group \"Hands and Fingers\", Kim published a number of works:\nIn collaboration with the literary group \"Poetic Spirits Group\", Kim published a number of works:\n\n"}

Canada and the United States have signed but not ratified the Convention.\n\nThe Convention stipulates that degrees and periods of study must be recognised unless \"substantial differences\" can be proved by the institution that is charged with recognition. Students and graduates are guaranteed fair procedures under the Convention.\nIt is named after Lisbon, Portugal, where it was signed in 1997, and entered into force on 1 February 1999 (or later in some countries, subject to ratification date).\n\nThe Convention established two bodies which oversee, promote and facilitate the implementation of the Convention:\n\nThe Committee is responsible for promoting the application of the Convention and overseeing its implementation. To this end, it can adopt, by a majority of the Signatory Parties, recommendations, declarations, protocols and models of good practice to guide the competent authorities of the Parties. Before making its decisions, the Committee seeks the opinion of the ENIC Network. As for the ENIC Network, it upholds and assists the practical implementation of the Convention by the competent national authorities.\n\nThe Lisbon Recognition Convention is an important instrument for the Bologna Process which aims at creating the \"European higher education area\" by making academic degree standards and quality assurance standards more comparable and compatible throughout Europe.\n\nThe possibility for students to study abroad has been recognised as an essential element of European integration since the foundation of the Council of Europe in 1949. Within the Council of Europe, several international treaties were elaborated in this field: starting with the right to education under Article 2 of the first Protocol of 1952 to the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention on the Equivalence of Diplomas leading to Admission to Universities was opened for signature in 1953, the European Convention on the Equivalence of Periods of University Study in 1956, the European Convention on the Academic Recognition of University Qualifications in 1959, the European Agreement on continued Payment of Scholarships to students studying abroad in 1969, and the European Convention on the General Equivalence of Periods of University Study in 1990.\n\nIn addition, under Article 2 of the Council of Europe's European Cultural Convention of 1954, each Contracting Party shall, insofar as may be possible: encourage the study by its own nationals of the languages, history and civilisation of the other Contracting Parties and grant facilities to those Parties to promote such studies in its territory; and endeavour to promote the study of its language or languages, history and civilisation in the territory of the other Contracting Parties and grant facilities to the nationals of those Parties to pursue such studies in its territory.\n\n"}

It was reprinted in the paperback edition of \"How to Be Alone\" without the subtitle.\n\nThe essay describes the experience of being thought of as difficult by his readers and his own experience at reading difficult books. Franzen then provides an extended commentary on most of Gaddis's novels.\n\nThe essay has attracted strong reactions. Novelist Ben Marcus was hostile. Novelist Cynthia Ozick mentioned the Franzen/Marcus disagreement as part of a larger picture on the nature of reviewing. Author and publisher Phil Jourdan was hostile. A 2013 review of Gaddis's letters described the literary significance of Gaddis by summarizing Franzen's essay.\n\nThe essay begins by describing some of the hostile reaction his third novel, \"The Corrections\", received. One letter writer, identified as \" from Maryland\", had a list of 30 vocabulary words (like \"diurnality\" and \"antipodes\") and some flowery phrases (like \"electro-pointillist Santa Claus faces\") from the novel that she did not approve of. She asked who Franzen was writing for, since it was certainly not the \"average person who just enjoys a good read.\" She answered her question with what Franzen calls a caricature of him and his presumed readership.\n\nFranzen finds himself ambivalent about his reaction to . He credits this ambivalence to his parents. His father was an admirer of scholars, while his mother was anti-élitist.\n\nFranzen proceeds to summarize his ambivalence in terms of two models.\n\nFranzen allows that it is quite possible for a novel to fulfill both models. He mentions \"Pride and Prejudice\" and \"The House of Mirth\". But he says that the models diverge when the novel is difficult.\n\nIn short, difficulty is a sign of success under the Status model, and a sign of failure under the Contract model.\n\nFranzen then proceeds to list nine books that he has never been able to complete, including \"Moby-Dick\", \"Don Quixote\", and \"Mason & Dixon\". (He will add to this list of unfinished books later in the essay.) He then mentions the most difficult book that he has completed is \"The Recognitions\".\n\nFranzen then tells the story of how he came to read \"The Recognitions\" in the early 1990s (about the time he published his second novel). His previous year had been miserable from a writing point of view, with a failed screenplay. Borrowing money, he left Philadelphia and moved into a Tribeca loft. At some point, looking for distractions, Franzen purchased a copy of the Gaddis novel, and then made it his daily job, reading it six to eight hours a day for a week and a half. He comments that the first two hundred pages were read partly out of professional curiosity, but that the rest were read out of love for the story, and that finishing the novel qualified as an act of virtue.\n\nFranzen includes some commentary on the novel. He also mentions that he failed to notice at the time the many parallels between the novel's main character and his own life and art.\n\nFranzen returns back to how in college he was trained to read and admire complicated texts, finding fault with modern Systems, and his ambition became that of creating literary Art:\nFranzen then identifies 13 authors that he determined in his early post-college days as \"a canon of intellectually, socially edgy, white-male American fiction writers\" who \"shared the postmodern suspicion of realism\". They are, listed in the order Franzen gave:\n\nThese are authors that, at the time, Franzen thought he wanted to write like. He made a serious attempt to read these authors, but he never got more than a few pages into them (including \"The Recognitions\"). But he realized that the writers he liked to read were not the difficult ones with \"academic and hipster respect.\" Meanwhile, he continued writing his own version of difficult, System novels.\n\nFranzen jumps ahead to his later, successful reading of \"The Recognitions\". He acknowledges it influenced him strongly, including his naming one of his novels \"The Corrections\".\n\nFranzen tells how a few years later he then attempted to read \"J R\". He had less free time, only putting in one or two hours a night. Somewhere past the halfway point, he put the book down for too long a stretch, and then found it impossible to return to the novel. He identifies his last connection to the novel: his bookmark is still on page 469.\n\nFranzen isn't sure who to \"blame\" here. He claims he thought of himself as the ideal Systems/Status reader, and for him to give up was like quitting a cult, as opposed to quitting a mainstream church, where people come and go all the time:\n\nA book review of a new book by Joseph McElroy, one of the \"hard-to-read 13\" mentioned by Franzen, began by citing \"Mr. Difficult\" as if it were an essential credential. The review lavishly praises McElroy for maintaining his difficulty without a hint of compromise.\n\nOnline critics were particularly vocal following the essay's publication. One suggested that Jonathan Franzen was alone in disliking being challenged by books, and that most readers enjoy trying difficult books, for they are able to mentally enrich the reader.\n\nThe theme of Gaddis-versus-Franzen is part of the James Reiss poem \"The Novel\". The poem says that after Gaddis, the novel \"didn't look back\", but \"... tramped past a bust of Jonathan Franzen.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "8713710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8713710", "title": "Mythological king", "text": "Mythological king\n\nA mythological king is an archetype in mythology. A king is considered a \"mythological king\" if he is included and described in the culture's mythology. Unlike a fictional king, aspects of their lives may have been real and legendary, or that the culture (through legend and story telling) believed to be real. In the myth, the legends that surround any historical truth might have evolved into symbols of \"kinship\" and leadership, and expanded with descriptions of spiritual, supernatural or magical chain of events. For example, in legend the king may have magical weapons and fight dragons or other mythological beasts. His archetypical role is usually to protect and serve the people.\n\nOne mythological archetype is the \"good king\" (McConnel 1979), also sometimes called the \"monarchical hero\". The \"good king\" is often the epic hero who made his world safe for civilization. Two examples that scholars have identified as filling the roles and earning the reputation of \"good kings\" were King Arthur and Beowulf, above and beyond their legendary and historic lives.\n\nBeowulf for example is a mythological king in training in the epic tradition, because he fights \"a strenuous battle against the disorganization of the universe.\" (McConnel 1979:59) Another is the great king \"Oxthar\", a leopard headed man that journeyed to the mythical underworld of Palulu (which is the supposed place where the sun goes to rest at night) and stole glowing stones from the bed of the sun to give light and power to his people.\n\nSome mythemes and cultural belief systems that are explored through myths about kings include: what is the source of the king's power, what is the training he must go through, what tests of courage does he pass, what are the battles he must fight, and what are the effects of taking power.\n\nIn epics of war, source of power is often having physical skills above ordinary men, owning \"magical\" weapons and political alliances.\n\nIn spiritual mythologies the king's power may come from a spiritual source and also spiritual weapons. In romantic and contemplative myths his power and success may from internal personality traits, such as from courage, wisdom and self-restraint.\n\nAnother common theme is the king's wounds, sacrifice and (sometimes) death for the betterment of the people. The Fisher King is an example of theme of the \"wounded king.\"\n\nOne other theme to be aware of in storytelling and mythology is that the king's health is often symbolic of the health of the kingdom or society: For example, a sick king means a weakened and vulnerable society, a healthy king means a healthy society, an emotionally or physically distant king means the society is in danger. Also, the installation of kings at the New Year was believed to renew the cosmos: \"The king becomes in a manner responsible for the stability, the fecundity and the prosperity of the entire Cosmos.\" (Eliade 1963:41)\n\n\n"}

Money and status symbols are prominently displayed by the New Russian, in particular jewelry and luxury cars. In the early 1990s, prominent attributes of the New Russian stereotype also included mobile phones and crimson jackets. A wide range of elite restaurants and nightclubs catering to the New Russian social circle have sprung up in Moscow.\n\nThe expression Новый Русский (lit. \"New Russian\") arose in the Russian-speaking sphere in the demonstrated English-language form of \"New Russian\", and was then calcified into the Russian-language form. Another sparse theory suggests the term appeared in foreign press, and then made its way into Russia. Supporters of this theory consider that the author of the expression was the American journalist Hedrick Smith who published two books about Russia: \"The Russians\" (1976) and \"The New Russians\" (1990).\n\nThere's also a theory that it's more of a pun, playing on the French words \"nouveau riche\" (i.e. new rich), having an absolutely similar meaning as the term \"New Russian\". \n\nIn the documentary film \"With a hard-sign on the end\" (С твёрдом знаком на конце, dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the creation of the newspaper Коммерсантъ, and shown on Channel One on 30 November 2009), author Leonid Parfenov demonstrates a copy of Kommersant from 1992 where editorial statistics were addressed as \"New Russian\".

He is best known as a character in William Shakespeare's play \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", in which he is Consort to Titania, Queen of the Fairies.\n\nOberon's status as king of the fairies comes from the character of Alberich (from Old High German \"alb-\" \"elf\" and \"-rîh-\", \"ruler\", \"king\"), a sorcerer in the legendary history of the Merovingian dynasty. In the legend, he is the otherworldly \"brother\" of Merowech, whose name is the eponym of the Merovingians but whose actual existence is unproven. Alberich wins for his eldest son, Walbert, the hand of a princess of Constantinople. In the \"Nibelungenlied\", a Burgundian poem written around the turn of the 13th century, Alberich guards the treasure of the Nibelungen, but is overcome by Siegfried.\n\nThe name Oberon is first attested to in the early 13th century \"chanson de geste\" entitled \"Les Prouesses et faitz du noble Huon de Bordeaux\", wherein it refers to an elven man of the forest encountered by the eponymous hero. Huon, son of Seguin count of Bordeaux, passed through the forest inhabited by Oberon. He was warned by a hermit not to speak to Oberon, but his courtesy had him answer Oberon's greetings, and so gain his aid in his quest. Huon had killed Charlot, the Emperor's son, in self-defense, and so he must visit the court of the amir of Babylon and perform various feats to win a pardon. He succeeds only with Oberon's aid.\n\nThis elf is dwarfish in height, though very handsome. He explains that, at his christening, an offended fairy cursed him to dwarfish height (an example of the wicked fairy godmother folklore motif) but relented and gave him great beauty as compensation. Alberich features as a dwarf in the \"Nibelungen\"; the dwarfish height was thus explained.\n\nThe real Seguin was Count of Bordeaux under Louis the Pious in 839, and died fighting against the Normans in 845. Charles l'Enfant, a son of Charles the Bald, died in 866 of wounds inflicted by a certain \"Aubouin\" in the circumstances of an ambush similar to the \"Charlot\" of the story. Thus, Oberon appears in a 13th-century French courtly fantasy that is based on a shred of 9th century fact. He is given some Celtic trappings, such as a magical cup (similar to the Holy Grail) that is ever full for the virtuous. \"The magic cup supplied their evening meal; for such was its virtue that it afforded not only wine, but more solid fare when desired\", according to Thomas Bulfinch. In this story, he is said to be the child of Morgan le Fay and Julius Caesar.\n\nA manuscript of the romance in the city of Turin contains a prologue to the story of \"Huon de Bordeaux\" in the shape of a separate romance of Auberon and four sequels, and there are later French versions, as well.\n\nShakespeare saw or heard of the French heroic song through the translation of John Bourchier, Lord Berners, called \"Huon of Burdeuxe\". In Philip Henslowe's diary, there is a note of a performance of a play \"Hewen of Burdocize\" on 28 December 1593.\n\nIn William Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" Oberon is the king of all of the fairies and is engaged in a dispute with his wife Titania, the fairy queen. They are arguing over custody of a child whom Oberon wants to raise to be his henchman. Titania wants to keep and raise the child for the sake of her mortal friend and follower who died giving birth to him. To make it look as if he didn't disappear, Titania put a fairy in his place. \n\nBecause Oberon and Titania are both powerful spirits connected to nature, their feuding disrupts the weather. Titania describes the consequences of their fighting:\nOberon tricks Titania into giving him back the child using the juice from a special flower that makes you \"madly dote upon the next live thing that it sees\". The flower was accidentally struck by Cupid's arrow when he attempted to shoot a young maiden in a field, instead infusing the flower with love. Oberon sends his servant, Puck, to fetch the flower, which he does successfully.\n\nFurious that Titania will not give him the child, he puts juice from a magical flower into her eyes while she is asleep. The effect of the juice will cause Titania to fall in love with the first live thing she sees. Titania awakens and finds herself madly in love with Bottom, an actor from the rude mechanicals whose head was just transformed into that of a donkey, thanks to a curse from Puck.\n\nMeanwhile, two couples have entered the forest: Lovers Hermia and Lysander are pursued by Demetrius, who also loves Hermia, and Helena, who loves Demetrius. Oberon witnesses Demetrius rejecting Helena, admires her amorous determination, and decides to help her. He sends Puck to put some of the juice in Demetrius's eyes, describing him as “a youth in Athenian clothing”, to make him fall in love with Helena. Puck finds Lysander – who is also a youth wearing Athenian clothing – and puts the love potion on Lysander's eyes. When Lysander wakes, he sees Helena first and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Demetrius has also been anointed with the flower and awakes to see Helena, pursued by Lysander, and a fight breaks out between the two young men. Oberon is furious with Puck, and casts a sleeping spell on the forest, making Puck reverse the potion on Lysander, admonishing Puck to not reverse the effects on Demetrius. Both couples awake and begin the journey back to Athens.\n\nOberon now looks upon Titania and her lover, Bottom, and feels sorry for what he has done. He reverses the spell using a magic herb. When she wakes, she is confused, thinking that she had a dream. Oberon explains that the dream was real, and the two reunite happily. They then return to Athens in the epilogue to bless the couples, becoming once again the benevolent fairy king and queen.\n\n\nA fanciful etymology was given for the name \"Oberon\" by Charles Mackay in his book \"The Gaelic Etymology of the Languages of Western Europe\" along with many other theories on words found in the English language that have not found mainstream acceptance.\n\n"}

In the preface to the first volume, Henry Playford, the printer of the volume and the son of the famous John Playford, extolls Purcell's skill as setter of English texts.\n\nThe portrait on the frontispiece was based on John Closterman's portrait of Purcell, currently in the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nThe first publication of a section of Purcell's opera \"Dido and Aeneas\" was the air \"Ah! Belinda\" in \"Orpheus Britannicus\", transposed up one step, from C to D.\n\nHenry Hall, who had studied composition with Purcell under John Blow, wrote the dedicatory poems at the beginning of each volume, (1698 and 1702) and also wrote one for Blow's \"Amphion Anglicus\".\n\nThe later 1706 London printing of \"Orpheus Britannicus\" by William Pearson utilized a new style of music printing to great success, where the notehead was in one piece with the background staff.\n\nJohn Blow's \"Amphion Anglicus\" (1700), a collection of Blow's songs, excerpts from odes, and chamber music, was published by subscription, after \"Orpheus Britannicus\"' success, and even shows a certain symmetry in title.\n\nA later engraver, Cole Benjamin (\"fl\" 1740–1760), printed as \"Orpheus Britannicus\" a seemingly unrelated set of engravings which he had made originally for \"The New Universal Magazine\" (1751–9).\n\nBenjamin Britten, working with Peter Pears,\nrealized and edited a number of songs from \"Orpheus Britannicus\" for both solo singer with piano and solo singer with orchestra.\n"}

Today the word \"penknife\" is the common British English term for both a pocketknife, which can have single or multiple blades, and for multi-tools, with additional tools incorporated into the design.\n\nOriginally, penknives were used for thinning and pointing quills to prepare them for use as dip pens and, later, for repairing or re-pointing the nib. A penknife might also be used to sharpen a pencil, prior to the invention of the pencil sharpener. A penknife did not necessarily have a folding blade, but might resemble a scalpel or wood knife by having a short, fixed blade at the end of a long handle. One popular (but incorrect) folk etymology makes an association between the size of a penknife and that of a small ballpoint pen.\n\nDuring the 20th century there has been a proliferation of multi-function knives with assorted blades and gadgets, including; awls, reamers, scissors, nail files, corkscrews, tweezers, toothpicks, and so on. The tradition continues with the incorporation of modern devices such as ballpoint pens, LED torches, and USB flash drives.\n\nThe most famous example of a multi-function penknife is the Swiss Army knife, some versions of which number dozens of functions and are really more of a folding multi-tool, incorporating a blade or two, than a penknife with extras.\n\nA larger folding knife, especially one in which the blade locks into place, is often called a claspknife.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2015744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015744", "title": "Phra Lak Phra Ram", "text": "Phra Lak Phra Ram\n\nPhra Lak Phra Ram (ພຣະລັກພຣະຣາມ, pʰrāʔ lāk pʰrāʔ ráːm) is the national epic of the Lao people, and is adapted from Valmiki's Hindu epic, the \"Ramayana.\" Ramayana reached Laos much later than Cambodia and Thailand (Siam) which caused the loss of its original Hindu influence and affected local adaptation. Similar to some Malay versions of the \"Hikayat Seri Rama\", the epic has lost the association with Hinduism and is instead considered a Jataka Story, a previous lifetime of the Buddha. It is also very popular in some parts of Northeastern Thailand, or Isan, a region of Thailand populated by a large number of Lao-speaking people and formerly part of Lanxang.\n\n\"Phra Lak Phra Ram\" is named after two principal characters, the brothers \"Phra Lak\", or Lakshaman, and \"Phra Ram\", or Rama. Since \"Phra Ram\" is considered the hero, it is believed the altered name was chosen for euphony. Veteran dance performers of Luang Prabang, however, say that \"Phra Lak\" comes first in deference to his voluntary assistance of \"Phra Ram,\" whose actions were obligatory to his kingship. Since it also considered a Jataka tale, it is referred to as \"Phra Ram Xadôk\" (ພຣະຣາມຊາດົກ, pʰrāʔ ráːm sáː dók). It was also called \"Rammakien\" (ຣາມມະກຽນ, Ráːm māʔ kian), but this the name for this other regional varieties in the \"Ramayana\" in general.\n\nLao legends attribute to the introduction of the \"Phra Ram Xadôk\" via the first king of Lane Xang, Chao Fa Ngoum, who arrived with his soldiers, artists, dancers, concubines, poets from musicians from Angkor who would have been familiar with the Reamker. Yet Indic civilizations knew of what is now Yunnan in China, as \"Gandhara\" no later than the second century B.C. Hindu culture, language and religion spread into that part of the world incident to the cultural achievements of the Sahavahanas (230 BC–AD 220.) Though definitive dates cannot be established for the gradual Tai inland migration from China, transmission of the epic likely occurred much sooner than the traditional date. Tai tribes definitely settled on the fringes of highly Indianized kingdoms of the Mon and Khmer culture, adopting much of Indic learning and knowledge. As those kingdoms receded, the Lao came to venerate the earlier Hindu temples, often decorated in Ramayana and the Mahabharata motifs, such as at Vat Phou in Champassak.\n\nEarlier versions remained somewhat similar to other versions, but by the 18th century, the versions are completely localised. Although Theravada Buddhism was known to the Mekong River Tai tribes as early as the 7th or 8th century B.C., it wasn't until the 14th or 15th centuries that a re-invigorated Theravada Buddhism supplanted earlier animist, Hindu, or Mahayana Buddhist loyalties. This would have also seen introduction of the Dasaratha Jataka, an ancient Buddhist crystallisation of the story. By the 18th century, the manuscripts are completely adapted to Lao culture and Theravada Buddhist religion.\n\nAlthough the Hindu nature of the \"Ramayana\" epic was lost in Laos, it was not completely erased. Indra, Shiva, and Brahma are present in the \"Phra Ram Xadôk.\" Lao culture has always been oral and visual, and oral tales were often codified into elaborate dance-dramas by the royal courts. Great influence in dance came from Khmer, Thai, and even Javanese culture, with a slight native flair. In \"khône\" and \"lakhone\" dance-dramas, the symbolism, costumes, and story are also more attuned to and influenced by Hindu Khmer, Thai, and even Javanese traditions.\n\nSome versions explicitly announce that it is a Jataka tale, while others are generally assumed to be so. Phra Lak and Phra Ram are the epitome of moral leadership, ethics, selflessness, and living true to dharma. Pha Ram is associated with a previous life of Siddartha Gautama, while his cousin Hapmanasouane (Ravanna) is often compared to Buddha's cousin \"Phra Thevathat\" or Buddha's final impasse to enlightenment, \"Phra Man\". The parallels include their religious knowledge and generally moral superiority but also their ruin by greed and desire. Hampanasouane as Mara, the personification of worldly desires who tried to tempt the Buddha during meditation, can be seen in both their searches for lust, power, and material gain. The cosmology and some elements are taken from the Tripitaka, such as the greater role of Indra vis-à-vis Shiva, and Indra asking riddles of religion and Buddhist thought to a young Hapmanasouane. Although important, religiously, it is subordinate to the greater and more chronologically recent Jataka tales of Phra Vet and the annals of the lifetime of Siddhartha Gautama.\n\nAnimistic elements are not as apparent in the \"Phra Lak Phra Ram\", but it is noteworthy to point out that the scenery takes place along the Mekong River. She is a great goddess and ancestral spirit that is as sacred and quintessentially 'theirs' as the Ganges is to India and a personification of water, bounty, and life. It was also the King of the Nagas that suggested Phra Ram's father move the capital from Maha Thani Si Pan Phao (modern-day Nong Khai, Thailand) across the bank to Chantaboury Sri Sattanak (modern-day Vientiane). Like most animistic elements, the Nāga is seen in both Buddhist and Hindu-influenced contexts, but worship of nagas predates Indian influence in the region, and are common in folktales of Laos and Isan. A unique version of the \"Phra Lak Phra Ram\", the \"Khwai Thoraphi\" focuses very much on Sankhip and Palichane's fight with the water buffalo. It was often read at temple, probably in Buddhism's attempt to replace Lao spirit propitiation ceremonies that involved water buffalo sacrifice.\n\nThe importance of \"Phra Lak Phra Ram\" to Lao culture can be seen in how ubiquitous it is. It is a mainstay of dance and drama, song, painting, sculpture, religious texts, and manuscripts. It is also seen in the more common arts, such as classical morlam, folklore, and village dances. Scenes from court dancers were performed on Lao New Year celebrations, and other Buddhist holidays. The texts are commonly read during sermons. And the tales themselves have been deeply interwoven into local folklore, myth, and legend. Sculpture, lacquerware, carvings, and paintings adorn temples and palaces. The chapters have been intricately crafted into song and dance and accompanying music. Through the Buddhist elements, Lao beliefs of morality and karma are re-affirmed. The first half of Lao versions also establish the mythology for the creation of the Lao polities, land features, and waterways, and it serves as a transmission of culture.\n\n\n\"Phra Ram\" (ພຣະຣາມ, pʰrāʔ ráːm) \n\"Phra Lak\" (ພຣະລັກ, pʰrāʔ lāk)\n\"Nang Sida\" (ນາງສີດາ, náːŋ sǐː daː)\n\"Thôtsakane\" or \"Hapmanasouane\" (ທົດສະກັນ, tʰōt sáʔ kan; ຮາບມະນາສວນ, hȃːp māʔ naː sŭaːn)\n\n\nDivine parentage makes these monkeys special. The more formal term for this class of humanoid simians is \"vanone\" (ວານອນ, váː nɔ́ːn). Because of this the male ones take the noble title \"Thao\" (ທ້າວ, tʰȃːo).\n\nDue to the fragile nature of organic matter in hot, humid weather, most of these texts have been mostly lost or destroyed. Nevertheless, several texts have been uncovered at Vat Phra Kèo in Vientiane, Vat Kang Tha in Ban Bo Ô, Ban Naxone Tay, Ban Hom, and Vat Nong Bon, in Laos; Roi Et in Thailand, now housed in Bangkok; and a manuscript of the Vientiane version in Phnom Penh. Of these, only Ban Hom and Ban Naxone Tay have complete versions preserved.\n\nOnly two modern printed editions exist. The most noted is Sachchidanda Sahai's version, mostly based on the Vat Phra Kèo version. It was printed in 1973 by the patronage of the Indian Embassy in Vientiane. Vietnamese scholar Vo Thu Tinh also published a 1972 version adapted from the manuscript of Vat Kang Tha, and is depicted at Vat Oup Muong in Vientiane. This version has been criticised for being too simplified.\n\nIn addition to the Phra Lak Phra Ram, other similar stories are known from Laos.\n\n- In a version of the Tai Lu people preserved in Louang Phrabang, Sita is born as Indra's wife Sujata, who is raped by Ravana and reborn as Ravana's daughter On Hi Slap.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36709000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36709000", "title": "Playing God (2012 film)", "text": "Playing God (2012 film)\n\nPlaying God was a 2012 BBC documentary in the \"Horizon\" series, hosted by Adam Rutherford. The documentary discusses synthetic biology, the potential of science \"breaking down nature into spare parts\" and then rebuilding it back up as we wish.\n\nAdam Rutherford has been studying the emerging field of synthetic biology for the past 10 years and believes that this sort of genetic tinkering is the most effective way to pass along traits between different organisms, given that this result cannot be easily obtained through typical mating of certain species. In \"Playing God\", he discusses the creation of the spider-goat by American researchers. It is a part goat, part spider hybrid, whose genetic code has been altered to be able to produce the same proteins found in spider silk. The milk produced by these goats can be used to create an artificial spider's web. Typically this silk is produced in small quantities by spiders but with the genetic modification of the goats, it may be mass produced. The goats are easier to handle in large groups than spiders and thus this could potentially increase the efficiency of silk production and consumer cost.\n\nThis technology is also being used to make bio-diesel to power cars. Biotech company, Amyris, in Emeryville, California, has applied synthetic biology to yeast. Instead of producing alcohol through the fermentation of sugar, this yeast produces diesel. The amount of diesel that is produced by this method is substantially greater than that of the conventional method and can exponentially increase the rate of production. This diesel has already been implemented in actual cars, in Brazil.\n\nOther researchers are looking at how we might, one day, control human emotions by sending 'biological machines' into our brains. MIT professor Ed Boyden leads a group in synthetic neuroscience. This team utilizes the genetic code for molecules that convert light into electrical energy and inserts it in a virus or cassette that may be installed into various organisms. Because the brain works on electrical impulses, this technology may be applied to neural circuits, in order to treat various neurological disorders. With this technology, the direct control of various light sensitive and electrical functions in the brain would be enabled.\n\nMIT professor, Ron Weiss, has worked extensively in this field and has been leading a team in incorporating the concepts of computer programming and engineering to biology. \"I decided to take what we understand in computing and apply that to programming biology. To me, that's really the essence of synthetic biology.\" Weiss' team published a study that discusses how they combined computer circuit elements with BioBricks parts. The way this works is that the computer circuit is able to distinguish between a healthy and mutated cell by utilizing a set of five criteria. Any cells that satisfy these conditions are deleted, similar to the way code could eliminate certain functions in computer programming. The ability to target individual cells could make this an alternative to treatments that may have harmful effects on healthy cells, such as chemotherapy.\n\nThe area of synthetic biology is extensively discussed in \"Playing God\". This is considered to be a relatively new field that incorporates elements of engineering into biology. It involves the blending and manipulation of natural molecules and unnatural molecules to obtain a specific outcome. Through this mean, scientists may use biology as a base for the development of synthetic life and genetic coding. This area of study has been noted with the potential to increase the efficiency of the production of certain biomolecules and naturally occurring materials, such as enzymes.\n\n\"Playing God\" and presenter, Adam Rutherford, have been subject to criticism following the release of this documentary. As plainly stated by Andrew Marszal of \"The Telegraph\", \"Rutherford overcooked it, particularly in his opening gambit – the revelation that scientists have developed a new hybrid breed of 'spider-goats'... we were left a little disappointed as Freckles, Pudding and Sweetie chomped and grazed around the farm looking for all the world like, well, goats.\" The portrayal of the applications of synthetic biology in this documentary appeared to be exaggerated and their importance not adequately stressed. The Alliance for Natural Health International (ANHI) wrote a reaction piece in which it expressed concern about the overwhelmingly positive tone the documentary as a whole had towards the development of this technology. \"The programme was almost wholly positive about the new technology, even though it has many serious potential consequences for humans and the planet... Dr Rutherford reacts like a kid in a sweetshop at each new technological marvel. Not once does he question whether creating spider-goats is necessary, or whether the ‘trickle-down’ of genetic engineering into the community is a step too far.\" \n"}

Her source for the tale was \"Ancilotto, King of Provino\", by Giovanni Francesco Straparola.\n\nIt is classified as Aarne-Thompson type 707 \"The dancing water, the singing apple, and the speaking bird\".\n\nA queen was reduced to poverty, and to selling sauces to support herself and her three daughters. One day, an old woman came to them and begged that they feed her a fine meal. They did so, and the woman, being a fairy, promised that the next time they wished something without thinking of her, it would come true. For a long time, they could not make a wish without thinking of her, but one day, the king came by. The oldest daughter, Roussette, said that if she married the king's admiral, she would make sails for all his ships; the second, Brunette, that if she married the king's brother, she would make him lace enough to fill a castle; the third, Blondine, that if she married the king, she would bear him two sons and a daughter, who would have golden chains about their necks and stars on their foreheads, and jewels would fall from their hair.\n\nA favorite repeated their words to the king, who summoned the sisters, and soon the marriages were concluded. A splendid wedding feast appeared out of nowhere, served on golden dishes, and the women realized it was from the old woman. Roussette hid the dishes when they left, but they were turned to earthenware when she arrived.\n\nThe king's mother was furious to hear that her sons had married such lowly women. Roussette was jealous of her sisters. Brunette gave birth to a son, and died. Blondine gave birth to two sons and a daughter, and the queen and Roussette put three puppies in their place. They took the children, including Brunette's, and gave them to a maid, who scrupled to kill them, but put them in a boat, with necklaces that might pay for their support if someone found them. The queen was sent back to her mother.\n\nThe fairies guarded the boat until it fell in with a pirate ship. The captain brought them to his childless wife. When they found that jewels fell from the children's hair, the captain gave up his piracy, because he would be rich without it. They named the princess Belle-Etoile (French for \"Beautiful Star\"); her older brother, Petit-Soleil (\"Little Sun\"); her younger, Heureux (\"Happy\"); and their cousin, who did not have the chain or star but was more beautiful than his cousins, Chéri (\"Darling\").\n\nAs Belle-Etoile and Chéri grew up, they fell in love, but believing themselves brother and sister, deeply regretted it. One day, she overheard the pirate and his wife talking, and learned where they had come from. She told her brothers and cousin, and they told the pirate and his wife that they wished to leave. The pirate implored them to stay, but Heureux persuaded him that they wondered too much about their birth to endure it. They set sail in a marvelous ship. It arrived at the castle of the king their father, and the king marveled over them. They asked only for a house in which to stay.\n\nThe Queen Mother realized from the description that these were her grandchildren. She sent the maid who had failed to drown them, and the woman told Belle-Etoile that she needed the dancing water, which would keep her from ever looking old. She told that story, and Chéri set out at once, against her will. He found a spring and rescued a dove from drowning. It set all sorts of animals that burrow to dig up the dancing water, and Chéri returned with it. He freed the dove and it flew off rather sulkily.\n\nThe maid came back with a tale of a singing apple, and Chéri once again set out. This time, a reading stranger directed him to the apple, and by helping a wounded dove, he gained the knowledge of the dragon that guarded it, and how it could be frightened off by mirrors, and returned with the apple.\n\nThe maid returned with a tale of a little green bird that knew everything. Belle-Etoile was deeply distressed by this, as she realized it could tell her who their parents were, and where they came from. Chéri set out again, but when he had nearly reached the bird, the rock opened, and he fell into a hall and was transformed into stone. Belle-Etoile fell ill from her distress at his absence, and Petit-Soleil set out to find Chéri, but suffered the same fate, and then Heureux did the same.\n\nBelle-Etoile set out after them, and rescued a dove from snow. It advised her not to climb the mountain where the bird perched, but to sing below it, and lure it down. She did so, and the bird advised her on how to free her brothers and all the rest of the prisoners.\n\nMeanwhile, the Queen Mother had persuaded the king to have his marriage to Blondine set aside, and marry again. Roussette persuaded the queen to invite Blondine to the wedding. The king invited the four children, and left a gentleman to await their arrival. The gentleman, on their arrival, told them the king's story. Belle-Etoile and her brothers arrived for the wedding, bringing their treasures, told how they were abandoned, and showed them to the king. Finally, the king asked the green bird who these children were, and where they came from. The bird proclaimed that they were the king's children and nephew.\n\nThe Queen Mother, Roussette, and the maid were all punished, and instead of marrying himself, the king married his daughter Belle-Etoile to Chéri.\n\n\"The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird\", \"The Wicked Sisters\", and \"The Tale of Tsar Saltan\" include the three sisters' marriages, and the sisterly hostility, though it is unusual to see only one sister evincing it. (\"The Three Little Birds\" is even more unusual, in that the oldest sister is the heroine and victim of her sisters.) \"The Bird of Truth\" begins with the children already abandoned, through the hostility of nobles to a low-born queen, but follows the same plot thereafter. \"The Water of Life\" sends the children after the treasures while omitting the motive to be rid of them; they only wish to make their home pleasant, and the one who told them had no ulterior motive.\n\nThe hostility from the mother-in-law is also found in \"The Boys with the Golden Stars\". It is a common motif in other fairy tales, not of this form: Perrault's version of \"Sleeping Beauty\", and \"The Six Swans\".\n\n"}

It was created by Scholastic Corporation. In 2011, Scholastic released its newest version, \"READ 180\" Next Generation, which has been fully aligned to meet the demands of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. Scholastic sold READ 180 to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2015.\n\n\"READ 180\" is based on a blended instructional model that includes whole-group instruction and three small-group rotations, adaptive software, differentiated instruction, and independent reading.\n\nThe program has three different versions: Upper Elementary (Grades 4–5), Middle School (Grades 6-8), and High School (Grades 9–12).\n\nThe Scholastic Reading Inventory (SRI) is a technology-based universal screener and progress monitor. SRI is used to generate a Lexile, or readability level, for each student. The purpose of administering the SRI is to determine if the student is a candidate for intervention. SRI is software that “assesses students’ reading levels, tracks students’ growth over time, and helps guide instruction according to students’ needs.” \n\n\"READ 180\" is a reading intervention program that provides individualized instruction to meet each student’s reading needs. The technology collects data based on individual responses and adjusts instruction to meet each students’ needs at their level, accelerating their path to reading mastery.\n\nTeachers begin and end each class session with whole-group instruction. Next students break into one of three rotations. First, the teacher leads small-group instruction, using the \"READ 180\" worktext called the \"rBook\", teachers monitor reading and differentiate instruction based on students’ needs. Second, students work independently in the \"READ 180\" software. The software leads students through five Learning Zones: the Reading Zone, the Word Zone, the Spelling Zone, the Success Zone, and the Writing Zone. Third, the students read independently in Independent Reading. Students select from the \"READ 180\" paperback or audiobook library and read a fiction or nonfiction book (or eRead).\n\n\"READ 180\" is the result of research that began in 1985 with the work of Dr. Ted Hasselbring and members of the Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt University. With a grant from the United States Department of Education’s Office of Special Education, Dr. Hasselbring developed software that used student performance data to individualize and differentiate the path of computerized reading instruction. This software became the prototype for the READ 180 program.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1998, Dr. Hasselbring and his team put their work to the test in Orange County, Florida. The Orange County Literacy Project used this \"READ 180\" prototype with more than 10,000 struggling students. The dramatic results Orange County public schools experienced were documented in the \"Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness\". These results led Scholastic to partner with Orange County public schools and Vanderbilt University to license the software, and to launch \"READ 180\". \n\nAfter the initial launch of \"READ 180\", Scholastic released Enterprise Edition in 2006 in collaboration with Dr. Kevin Feldman and Dr. Kate Kinsella. \"READ 180\" Enterprise Edition featured the \"READ 180\" \"rBook\", structured engagement routines for English language learners, and the Scholastic Achievement Manager (SAM).\n\nA number of studies have been conducted regarding the effectiveness of using \"READ 180\" in the classroom. The company's webpage includes a searchable list of research articles. \n\nBelow is a sample of some of the current research available on \"READ 180\". \n\nThe U.S. Department of Education Striving Readers Project shows \"READ 180\" effective in combating adolescent illiteracy.\n\nThe Institute for Educational Science (IES) What Works Clearinghouse recognized \"READ 180\" for potentially positive effects in comprehension and general literacy achievement. \nSlavin, Cheung, and Groff, and Lake (2008) placed \"READ 180\" in a select group of adolescent literacy programs that showed more evidence of effectiveness than 121 other programs reviewed.\n\nHarty, Fitzgerald, and Porter (2008) indicated that \"READ 180\" can be successfully implemented in an afterschool setting. \nLang, Torgesen, Vogel, Chanter, Lefsky, and Petscher (2009) published a study which indicated that ninth-grade students enrolled in \"READ 180\" exceeded the benchmark for expected yearly growth on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test. \n\nDe La Paz (1997) documented the foundational research conducted by Dr. Ted Hasselbring and his team from Peabody College at Vanderbilt University.\n\n"}

As a member of Congress, Owen successfully pushed through the bill that established Smithsonian Institution and served on the Institution's first Board of Regents. Owen also served as a delegate to the Indiana Constitutional Convention in 1850 and was appointed as U.S. \"chargé d'affaires\" (1853–58) to Naples.\n\nOwen was a knowledgeable exponent of the socialist doctrines of his father, Robert Owen, and managed the day-to-day operation of New Harmony, Indiana, the socialistic utopian community he helped establish with his father in 1825. Throughout his adult life, Robert Dale Owen wrote and published numerous pamphlets, speeches, books, and articles that described his personal and political views, including his belief in spiritualism. Owen co-edited the \"New-Harmony Gazette\" with Frances Wright in the late 1820s in Indiana and the \"Free Enquirer\" in the 1830s in New York City. Owen was an advocate of married women's property and divorce rights, secured inclusion of an article in the Indiana Constitution of 1851 that provided tax-supported funding for a uniform system of free public schools, and established the position of Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. Owen is also noted for a series of open letters he wrote in 1862 that favored the abolition of slavery and supported general emancipation, as well as a suggestion that the federal government should provide assistance to freedmen.\n\nRobert Dale Owen was born on November 7, 1801, in Glasgow, Scotland, to Ann (or Anne) Caroline Dale and Robert Owen. His mother was the daughter of David Dale, a Scottish textile manufacturer; his Welsh-born father became part-owner and manager of the New Lanark Mills, his father-in-law's textile mill at New Lanark, Scotland. Robert Dale was the eldest surviving son of eight children; his younger siblings (three brothers and three sister) were William, Ann (or Anne) Caroline, Jane Dale, David Dale, Richard Dale, and Mary.\n\nOwen grew up in Braxfield, Scotland, and was privately tutored before he was sent at the age of sixteen to Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg's school at Hofwyl, Switzerland. The Swiss school exposed Owen to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi's method of education. After completing his formal education, Owen returned to Scotland to join his father in the textile business at New Lanark.\n\nOwen's father, a successful textile manufacturer and philanthropist, became a noted socialist reformer whose vision of social equality included, among other projects, the establishment of experimental utopian communities in the United States and the United Kingdom. Robert Dale Owen, who shared many of his father's views on social issues immigrated to the United States in 1825, became a U.S. citizen, and helped his father manage the socialistic community at New Harmony, Indiana. Owen's three surviving brothers (William, David, and Richard) and his sister, Jane, also immigrated to the United States and became residents of New Harmony.\n\nBetween 1825 and 1828, Owen managed the day-to-day operations of the socialistic community at New Harmony, Indiana, while his father returned to Britain to resume his social reform and philanthropic work in Europe. In addition to his other work, Owen and Frances Wright, a wealthy, Scottish philanthropist and radical reformer, published articles in the \"New-Harmony Gazette\", the town's liberal weekly newspaper, and served as its co-editors. Established in 1825, the \"Gazette\" was one of Indiana's earliest newspapers; however, it ceased publications in February 1829.\n\nAfter the New Harmony utopian community dissolved in 1827, Owen traveled in Europe before returning to the United States in 1829. During this period Owen wrote \"Moral Physiology; or, A Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population Question\" (1830), a controversial pamphlet on the topic of population control. It was the first book in the United States to advocate birth control.\n\nOwen moved to New York City, where he and Wright co-edited the weekly \"Free Enquirer\" until 1831–32. As they had done in the \"New Harmony Gazette\", the \"Free Enquirer\" continued to express their radical views on a variety of subjects, including abolition of slavery, women's rights, universal suffrage, free public education, birth control, and religion. Owen returned to New Harmony, Indiana, in 1833, after he and Wright discontinued their editorship of the New York newspaper.\n\nOwen and Mary Jane Robinson were married before a justice of the peace on April 12, 1832, in New York City. After an extended trip to Europe, they relocated to New Harmony, Indiana. The couple had six children, two of whom died at an early age. Their surviving children were Florence (b. 1836), Julian Dale (b. 1837), Ernest (b. 1838), and Rosamond (b. 1843).\n\nOn June 23, 1876, five years after the death of his first wife, Owen married Lottie Walton Kellogg at Caldwell, New York; he died a year later.\n\nDuring 1829–30, Owen became an active leader in the Working Men's Party in New York City. In contrast to other Democrats of the era, Owen was opposed to slavery, although his radical partisanship distanced him from the leading abolitionists of the era.\n\nAfter Owen's return to New Harmony, Indiana, in 1833, he became active in state politics. Owen served in the Indiana House of Representatives (1835–38; 1851–53). He distinguished himself as an influential member of the Indiana General Assembly during his first term by securing appropriations for the state's tax-supported public school system. In addition, Owen was instrumental in introducing legislation and argued in support of widows and married women's property rights, but the bill was defeated. He also proposed laws granting women greater freedom of divorce.\n\nIn addition to serving in the state legislature, Owen was elected as a delegate from Posey County, Indiana, to the Indiana Constitutional Convention in 1850. At the convention, Owen initiated a proposal to include provisions for women's property rights in the state' constitution. Although it was not approved, this early effort to protect women's rights led to later laws that were passed to secure women's property, divorce, and voting rights. One of Owen's lasting legacies was his authorship and efforts to secure the inclusion of an article in the Indiana Constitution of 1851 that provided state funding for a uniform system of common schools that are free and open to all and established the office of the state's superintendent of public instruction.\n\nAfter his first term in the Indiana legislature and two unsuccessful campaigns for election to the U.S. Congress in 1838 and in 1840, Owen was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1842. He served from 1843 to 1847 in the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Congresses. Owen was chairman of the Committee on Roads and Canals during the Twenty-eighth Congress. He was also involved in the debates about the annexation of Texas and an Oregon boundary dispute in 1844 that led to the establishment of the U.S-British boundary at the 49th parallel north, the result of the Oregon Treaty (1846).\n\nWhile serving as a member of Congress, Owen introduced and helped to secure passage of the bill that founded the Smithsonian Institution in 1846. Owen was appointed to the Smithsonian Institution's first Board of Regents and chaired its Building Committee, which oversaw the construction of the Smithsonian Institution Building in Washington, D.C., and recommended James Renwick, Jr. as architect, James Dixson and Gilbert Cameron as the contractors, and the Seneca Quarry for its distinct, dark-red sandstone.\n\nOwen, his brother David Dale Owen, and architect Robert Mills, were involved in developing preliminary plans for the Smithsonian Building. These early plans influenced Renwick's choice of the Romanesque Revival architectural style (sometimes referred to as Norman-style architecture) and his three-story design for the building, which was finally selected, although not without controversy. Owen's book \"Hints on Public Architecture\" (1849) argued the case for the suitability of Renwick's Romanesque Revival (Norman) architectural style for public buildings such as the Smithsonian \"Castle,\" which he discussed in detail. Seven full-page illustrations and details of the building's architectural elements were prominently featured in the book, leading some to criticize Owen for his bias toward Renwick and his preference for Norman-style architecture over other popular styles.\n\nOwen was defeated in his bid for re-election to Congress in 1846; however, he remained active in public service and was once again elected to serve in the Indiana General Assembly. On May 24, 1853, while Owen was serving as a state legislator in Indiana, President Franklin Pierce appointed him as U.S. minister (\"Chargé d'Affaires\" and Minister Resident) to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies at Naples. Owen served in the diplomatic post until September 20, 1858, and then retired from political life, although he remained actively interested in public affairs and social reform issues.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Owen served in the Ordnance Commission to supply the Union army; on March 16, 1863, he was appointed to the Freedman's Inquiry Commission. The commission was a predecessor to the Freedmen's Bureau.\n\nIn 1862 Owen wrote a series of open letters to U.S. government officials, including President Abraham Lincoln and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, to encourage them to support general emancipation. Owen's letter of July 23, 1862, was published in the \"New York Evening Post\" on August 8, 1862, and his letter of September 12, 1862, was published in the same newspaper on September 22, 1862. In another open letter that Owen wrote to President Lincoln on September 17, 1862,\nhe urged the president to abolish slavery on moral grounds. Owen also believed that emancipation would weaken the Confederate forces and help the Union army win the war. On September 23, 1862, Lincoln issued a preliminary version of the Emancipation Proclamation (as he had first resolved to do in mid-July). In \"Emancipation is Peace\", a pamphlet that Owen wrote in 1863, he confirmed his view that general emancipation was a means to end the war. In \"The Wrong of Slavery, the Right of Emancipation, and the Future of the African Race\", a report that Owen wrote in 1864, he also suggested that the Union should provide assistance to freedmen.\n\nToward the end of his political career, Owen continued his effort to obtain federal voting rights for women. In 1865 he submitted an initial draft for a proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would not restrict voting rights to males. However, Article XIV, Section 2, in the final version of the Amendment, which became part of the U.S. Constitution in 1868, was modified to limit suffrage to males who were U.S. citizens over the age of twenty-one.\n\nIn \"The authenticity of the Bible\" (1833), Owen remarked :\n\nFor a \"century and a half\", then, after Jesus' death, we have no means whatever of substantiating even the existence of the Gospels, as now bound up in the New Testament. There is a perfect blank of 140 years; and a most serious one it is. \n\nLike his father, Owen converted to Spiritualism and was the author of two books on the subject: \"Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World\" (1859) and \"The Debatable Land Between this World and the Next\" (1872).\n\nAlthough he retired from active public service at the conclusion of his work as a member of the Freedman's commission on May 15, 1864, Owen continued his writing career. Major writing projects in retirement included \"Beyond the Breakers\" (1870), a novel; \"The Debatable Land Between this World and the Next\" (1871), one of his two books on spiritualism; and \"Threading My Way\" (1874), his autobiography. Owen also wrote several articles that were published in the \"Atlantic Monthly\" and \"Scribner's Monthly\".\n\nIn 1875 Owen suffered a mental breakdown that was severe enough for him to be hospitalized at the Indiana Hospital for the Insane in Indianapolis, where he underwent three months of treatment. Owen recovered from the illness, was released from the hospital, and resumed writing. On June 23, 1876, a year before his death, Owen married Lottie Walton Kellogg at Caldwell, New York.\n\nOn June 24, 1877, Owen died at his summer home at Crosbyville on Lake George, New York. Initially he was buried in the town of Lake George in Warren County, New York. Later, his remains were exhumed and interred at New Harmony, Indiana, beside his first wife, Mary Jane Owen.\n\nOne of Owen's most significant legacies in Indiana was to secure the inclusion of an article in the Indiana Constitution of 1851 that provided tax-supported funding for a uniform system of free public schools and established the position of Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. His early efforts to protect women's rights were another of his political legacies. Although he was unsuccessful in adding provisions to protect women's rights to Indiana's state constitution of 1851, his efforts paved the way for others to follow. Eventually, Indiana laws granted women's property and voting rights, as well as greater freedom in divorce.\n\nAs a U.S. Congressman, Owen introduced federal legislation that founded the Smithsonian Institution in 1846. He was also a member of the Smithsonian Institution's first Board of Regents and its Building Committee. His vision for the Smithsonian Institution Building, along with the preliminary plans and suggestions made by his brother, David Dale Owen, and architect Robert Mills, influenced architect James Renwick Jr.'s design for the Romanesque Revival-style building in Washington, D.C.\n\nOwen's impact on the issues of slavery and emancipation is less direct. In a series of open letters he wrote in 1862 and in publications that followed, Owen encouraged the abolition of slavery on moral grounds, supported general emancipation, and suggested that the federal government should provide assistance to freedmen. Some historians have concluded that these open letters and Civil War-era pamphlets \"helped immeasurably to solidify public opinion\" in favor of emancipation.\n\nThe town of Dale, Indiana was named in Owen's honor. \n\nIn 1911, the women of Indiana dedicated a memorial to Owen on the grounds of the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis that included a bronze bust of the statesman created by New Castle, Indiana native Frances Goodwin. The bust of Owen disappeared in the early 1970s; only its pedestal remains.\n\nOwen's published works included pamphlets, speeches, tracts, books, and numerous articles for periodicals and newspapers. \n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1362567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1362567", "title": "Romanian phonology", "text": "Romanian phonology\n\nIn the phonology of the Romanian language, the phoneme inventory consists of seven vowels, two or four semivowels (different views exist), and twenty consonants. In addition, as with all languages, other phonemes can occur occasionally in interjections or recent borrowings.\n\nNotable features of Romanian include two unusual diphthongs and and the central vowel .\n\nThere are seven monophthongs in Romanian:\n\nThe table below gives a series of word examples for each vowel.\nAlthough most of these vowels are relatively straightforward and similar or identical to those in many other languages, the close central unrounded vowel is uncommon as a phoneme and especially uncommon amongst Indo-European languages.\n\nAccording to , is phonetically open-mid somewhat retracted central , rather than mid central.\n\nIn addition to the seven core vowels, in a number of words of foreign origin (predominantly French, but also German) the mid front rounded vowel (rounded Romanian ; example word: \"bleu\" 'light blue') and the mid central rounded vowel (rounded Romanian ; example word: \"chemin de fer\" 'Chemin de Fer') have been preserved, without replacing them with any of the existing phonemes. The borrowed words have become part of the Romanian vocabulary and follow the usual inflexion rules, so that the new vowels, though less common, could be considered as part of the Romanian phoneme set. Romanian dictionaries use in their phonetic descriptions to represent both vowels, which suggests that they may be actually pronounced identically by Romanian speakers. \n\nBecause they are not native phonemes, their pronunciation may fluctuate or they may even be replaced by the diphthong . In older French borrowings it has often been replaced by , , or , as in \"șofer\" ('driver', from French \"chauffeur\"), \"masor\" ('masseur', from \"masseur\"), and \"sufleor\" ('theater prompter', from \"souffleur\").\n\nSimilarly, borrowings from languages such as French and German sometimes contain the close front rounded vowel : \"ecru\" , \"tul\" , \"führer\" . The symbol used for it in phonetic notations in Romanian dictionaries is . Educated speakers usually pronounce it , but other realizations such as also occur. Older words that originally had this sound have had it replaced with , , or . For instance, Turkish \"kül\" became \"ghiul\" ('large ring'), Turkish \"tütün\" became \"tutun\" ('tobacco'), but \"tiutiun\" in the Moldavian subdialect, German \"Düse\" gave \"duză\" ('nozzle') and French \"bureau\" became \"birou\" ('desk', 'office').\n\nAccording to Ioana Chițoran, Romanian has two diphthongs: and . As a result of their origin (diphthongization of mid vowels under stress), they appear normally in stressed syllables and make morphological alternations with the mid vowels and .\n\nIn addition to these, the semivowels and can be combined (either before, after, or both) with most vowels. One view considers that only and can follow an obstruent-liquid cluster such as in \"broască\" ('frog') and \"dreagă\" ('to mend') and form real diphthongs, whereas the rest are merely vowel–glide sequences.\nThe traditional view (taught in schools) considers all of the above as diphthongs.\n\nAs can be seen from the examples above, the diphthongs and contrast with and respectively, though there are no minimal pairs to contrast and . Impressionistically, the two pairs sound very similar to native speakers. Because doesn't appear in the final syllable of a prosodic word, there are no monosyllabic words with ; exceptions might include \"voal\" ('veil') and \"doar\" ('only, just'), though Ioana Chițoran argues that these are best treated as containing glide-vowel sequences rather than diphthongs. In some regional pronunciations, the diphthong tends to be pronounced as a single vowel .\n\nOther triphthongs such as and occur sporadically in interjections and uncommon words.\n\nBorrowings from English have enlarged the set of ascending diphthongs to also include , , , and , or have extended their previously limited use. Generally, these borrowings have retained their original spellings, but their pronunciation has been adapted to Romanian phonology. The table below gives some examples.\n\nBorrowings such as \"whisky\" and \"week-end\" are listed in some dictionaries as starting with the ascending diphthong , which corresponds to the original English pronunciation, but in others they appear with the descending diphthong .\n\nRomanian has vowel alternation or apophony triggered by stress. A stressed syllable has a low vowel, or a diphthong ending in a low vowel, and an unstressed syllable has a mid vowel. Thus alternates with , with , and with .\n\nThis alternation developed from Romanian vowel breaking (diphthongization) and reduction (weakening). The Eastern Romance mid vowels were broken in stressed syllables, giving the Romanian diphthongs , and the low vowel was reduced in unstressed syllables, giving the Romanian central vowel .\n\nThese sound changes created the stress-triggered vowel alternations in the table below. Here stressed syllables are marked with underlining (\"a\"):\nThis has since been morphologized and now shows up in verb conjugations and nominal inflection: \"oaste\" — \"oști\", 'army' — 'armies'.\n\nStandard Romanian has twenty phonemic consonants, as listed in the table below. Where symbols for consonants occur in pairs, the left represents a voiceless consonant and the right represents a voiced consonant.\n\nBesides the consonants in this table, a few consonants can have allophones:\n\nThe consonant inventory of Romanian is almost the same as Italian. Romanian, however, lacks the palatal consonants , which merged with by lenition, and the affricate changed to by spirantization. Romanian has the fricative and the glottal fricative , which do not occur in Italian.\n\nPalatalized consonants appear mainly at the end of words, and mark two grammatical categories: plural nouns and adjectives, and second person singular verbs.\n\nThe interpretation commonly taken is that an underlying morpheme palatalizes the consonant and is subsequently deleted. However, , , and become , , and , respectively, with very few phonetically justified exceptions, included in the table below, which shows that this palatalization can occur for all consonants.\n\nIn certain morphological processes is replaced by the full vowel , for example\n\nThis may explain why is perceived as a separate sound by native speakers and written with the same letter as the vowel .\n\nThe non-syllabic can be sometimes found inside compound words like \"câțiva\" ('a few') and \"oriunde\" ('wherever'), where the first morpheme happened to end in this . A word that contains this twice is \"cincizeci\" ('fifty').\n\nIn old Romanian and still in some local pronunciations there is another example of such a non-syllabic, non-semivocalic phoneme, derived from , which manifests itself as labialization of the preceding sound. The usual IPA notation is . It is found at the end of some words after consonants and semivowels, as in \"un urs\", pronounced ('a bear'), or \"îmi spui\" ('you tell me'). The disappearance of this phoneme might be attributed to the fact that, unlike , it didn't play any morphological role. It is possibly a trace of Latin endings containing (\"-us\", \"-um\"), this phoneme is related to vowel used to connect the definite article \"l\" to the stem of a noun or adjective, as in \"domn — domnul\" ('lord — the lord', cf. Latin \"dominus\").\n\nAs with other languages, Romanian interjections often use sounds beyond the normal phoneme inventory or disobey the normal phonotactical rules, by containing unusual phoneme sequences, by allowing words to be made up of only consonants, or by consisting of repetitions. Such exceptional mechanisms are needed to obtain an increased level of expressivity. Often, these interjections have multiple spellings or occasionally none at all, which accounts for the difficulty of finding the right approximation using existing letters. The following is a list of examples.\n\n\nRomanian has a stress accent, like almost all other Romance languages (with the notable exception of French). Generally, stress falls on the rightmost syllable of a prosodic word (that is, the root and derivational material but excluding inflections and final inflectional vowels). Although a lexically marked stress pattern with penultimate stress exists, any morphologically derived forms will continue to follow the unmarked pattern.\n\nStress is not normally marked in writing, except occasionally to distinguish between homographs, or in dictionaries for the entry words. When it is marked, the main vowel of the stressed syllable receives an accent (usually acute, but sometimes grave), for example \"véselă — vesélă\" ('jovial', fem. sg. — 'tableware').\n\nIn verb conjugation, noun declension, and other word formation processes, stress shifts can occur. Verbs can have homographic forms only distinguished by stress, such as in \"el suflă\" which can mean 'he blows' (\"el súflă\") or 'he blew' (\"el suflắ\") depending on whether the stress is on the first or the second syllable, respectively. Changing the grammatical category of a word can lead to similar word pairs, such as the verb \"a albí\" ('to whiten') compared to the adjective \"álbi\" ('white', masc. pl.). Stress in Romanian verbs can normally be predicted by comparing tenses with similar verbs in Spanish, which does indicate stress in writing.\n\nSecondary stress occurs according to a predictable pattern, falling on every other syllable, starting with the first, as long as it does not fall adjacent to the primary stress.\n\nLanguages such as English, Russian, and Arabic are called stress-timed, meaning that syllables are pronounced at a lower or higher rate so as to achieve a roughly equal time interval between stressed syllables. Another category of languages are syllable-timed, which means that each syllable takes about the same amount of time, regardless of the position of the stresses in the sentence. Romanian is one of the syllable-timed languages, along with other Romance languages (French, Spanish, etc.), Telugu, Yoruba, and many others. (A third timing system is mora timing, exemplified by Classical Latin, Fijian, Finnish, Hawaiian, Japanese, and Old English.)\n\nThe distinction between these timing categories may sometimes seem unclear, and definitions vary. In addition, the time intervals between stresses/syllables/morae are in reality only approximately equal, with many exceptions and large deviations having been reported. However, whereas the actual time may be only approximately equal, the differences are perceptually identical.\n\nIn the case of Romanian, consonant clusters are often found both in the syllable onset and coda, which require physical time to be pronounced. The syllable timing rule is then overridden by slowing down the rhythm. Thus, it is seen that stress and syllable timing interact. The sample sentences below, each consisting of six syllables, are illustrative:\n\nThe total time length taken by each of these sentences is obviously different, and attempting to pronounce one of them with the same rhythm as the other results in unnatural utterances.\n\nTo a lesser extent, but still perceivably, the syllables are extended in time also on one hand by the presence of liquid and nasal consonants, and on the other by that of semivowels in diphthongs and triphthongs, such as shown in the examples below.\n\nA simple way to evaluate the length of a word, and compare it to another, consists in pronouncing it repeatedly at a natural speech rate.\n\nA detailed description of the intonation patterns must consider a wide range of elements, such as the focus of the sentence, the theme and the rheme, emotional aspects, etc. In this section only a few general traits of the Romanian intonation are discussed. Most importantly, intonation is essential in questions, especially because, unlike English and other languages, Romanian does not distinguish grammatically declarative and interrogative sentences.\n\nIn non-emphatic yes/no questions the pitch rises at the end of the sentence until the last stressed syllable. If unstressed syllables follow, they often have a falling intonation, but this is not a rule.\n\nIn Transylvanian speech these yes/no questions have a very different intonation pattern, usually with a pitch peak at the beginning of the question: [ai ↗stins lumi↘na]\n\nIn selection questions the tone rises at the first element of the selection, and falls at the second.\n\nWh-questions start with a high pitch on the first word and then the pitch falls gradually toward the end of the sentence.\n\nRepeat questions have a rising intonation.\n\nTag questions are uttered with a rising intonation.\n\nUnfinished utterances have a rising intonation similar to that of yes/no questions, but the pitch rise is smaller.\n\nVarious other intonation patterns are used to express: requests, commands, surprise, suggestion, advice, and so on.\n\n\n"}

In 1846, Henry Poole, credited as being the \"Founder of Savile Row\", opened an entrance to his tailoring premises into No. 32 Savile Row. The term \"bespoke\" is understood to have originated in Savile Row when cloth for a suit was said to \"be spoken for\" by individual customers. The short street has been termed the \"golden mile of tailoring\", where customers have included Charles, Prince of Wales, Jude Law, Winston Churchill, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Laurence Olivier, Duke Ellington, Lord Nelson and Napoleon III.\n\nIn 1969, Nutters of Savile Row modernised the style and approach of the traditional tailors; a modernisation which continued in the 1990s with the arrival of designers including Richard James, Ozwald Boateng and Timothy Everest. With increasing rents the number of tailoring businesses on Savile Row had declined to 19 by 2006. There were also criticisms from Giorgio Armani of falling behind the times. However, since the mid-noughties Savile Row has been enjoying a remarkable resurgence, perhaps typified by the arrival of young and innovative tailors like Cad and the Dandy, who have sought re-invigoration by means of modern technologies such as the internet.\n\nThe website GQ British featured an article in January 2018 about Savile Row. It contains a list of SR tailors and states: \"London is undeniably menswear’s global capital and the most important street in this world is Savile Row, a modest Mayfair row of the men’s tailors that quite simply make the best suits in the world.\"\n\nOn the website Town and Country House, writer Dylan Jones is quoted in an article published in 2017 which is a guide to SR: \"London is the home of menswear. We invented the suit, and in Savile Row we have the most important men’s shopping street in the world but we also have the very best in contemporary formal wear.\"\n\nTailoring has been associated with Savile Row since the 19th century, when Beau Brummell, who epitomised the well-dressed man, patronised the tailors congregated on the Burlington Estate, notably around Cork Street. By 1803 some were occupying premises in Savile Row, but none of those original tailors survive today.\nThe Savile Row Bespoke Association was founded in 2004 to protect and to develop bespoke tailoring as practised in Savile Row and the surrounding streets. Founder members include: Anderson & Sheppard, Dege & Skinner, Gieves & Hawkes and Henry Poole. The member tailors are required to put at least 50 hours of hand labour into each two-piece suit.\n\nIn a March 2006 report by the City of Westminster (Department of Planning and City Development), \"Bespoke Tailoring in London’s West End\", it was estimated that between 6,000 and 7,000 men's suits were made in and around the Savile Row area annually. This represented a turnover of approximately £21 million. A Reuters article in February 2013 suggested that the total revenue for the informal group of suitmakers was now estimated to be £30-35 million pounds, with several tailoring houses having over 10% growth in recent years. The Fashion Industry's contribution as a whole to the British economy is an estimated £26 billion a year.\n\nAs of August 2014, Norway’s Oil Fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, had acquired a 57.8 percent interest in the Pollen Estate. This includes properties in Mayfair, among which is Savile Row.\n\nIn November 2016, SR became a Special Policy Area within the City of Westminster. This gives SR special planning status in order to safeguard its character: \"Development in the Savile Row Special Policy Area will complement and enhance its role as an international centre of excellence for bespoke tailoring.\" SeeWestminster Special Policy Area 2016.\n\n\nTailors Dege & Skinner made two frock coat uniforms worn by Prince Harry and Prince William at the Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May 2018. As well as the two uniforms, four outfits for the page boys were also created, challenging the tailors because of the boys size. 8 weeks notice was given with very strict secrecy involved. When asked about any business opportunities that might be forthcoming from the wedding, Mr. Skinner said: \"It’s difficult to say what effect it will have but the company has been mentioned in many forms of media in the last three or four days, so only time will tell\". He also said: \"It helps us to keep focused on maintaining the skills and offering apprenticeships for making the clothes and keeping the business going for the next generation.\"\n\n\n\nIn 2004, A&S' lease at No.30 expired, and the building's landlords wanted to raise its rent. Shortly thereafter, Anda Rowland assumed A&S' daily operations. Rowland, daughter of entrepreneur Tiny Rowland (who had acquired A&S in the late 1970s, and whose family still holds an 80 per cent stake in the business) had been working at Parfums Christian Dior in Paris. After Anda Rowland’s mother, Josie, decided to relocate A&S to its current, smaller premises on nearby Old Burlington Street, she appealed to her daughter for assistance in managing the firm. Before Anda's arrival, A&S did not operate a web site or viable computer network, costs were left unrecorded and approximately £500,000 worth of unpaid tailoring bills (money owed to A&S) had accrued. Rowland stated: \"We’d been in the old buildings since the 1920s and, like many Savile Row tailors or traditional companies, your image becomes tied … like Harrods, it becomes tied to the building.\"\n\nAnda Rowland's initial act at A&S was to create an internet presence for the firm. A&S' website is a marketing tool and, says Rowland, “it helps to remind people or reinforces the idea that we have one foot in the past, but, also, one foot very much in today”. Since 2005, A&S' sales have risen exponentially so that, allowing for the hiring of six additional full-time apprentices, for a total of eight. As part of its 2012 revival, A&S opened a haberdashery shop on Clifford Street, at the end of the Row. Previous A&S customers include: Cary Grant, Gary Cooper, Fred Astaire, Pablo Picasso, Bryan Ferry, Manolo Blahnik and Tom Ford. In January 2013, HRH Prince Charles visited A&S. In the 30 years that A&S had tailored his suits and coats, HRH had never actually visited the company's premises. In 2012, A&S' revenues topped £4 million and its annual revenues have increased over 13 percent each year since 2009. A&S manager Colin Heywood stated: \"We're doing very well, actually. We've found that business has picked up in the last few years, and we couldn't be busier.\"\n\n\nAmies was one of the first European designers to venture into the ready-to-wear market when he teamed up with Hepworths in 1959 to design a range of menswear. In 1961, he made fashion history by staging the first men's ready-to-wear catwalk shows, at the Ritz Hotel in London Amies also undertook design for in-house work wear, which developed from designing special clothes for groups such as the Oxford University Boat Club and London Stock Exchange. Amies also designed costumes for films, including \"\".\n\nAmies is perhaps best known to the British public for his work for Queen Elizabeth II. The association began in 1950, when Amies made several outfits for the then Princess Elizabeth's royal tour to Canada. Although the couture side of the Hardy Amies business was traditionally less financially successful, the award of a Royal warrant of appointment as official dressmaker in 1955 gave his house a degree of respectability and resultant publicity. One of his best known creations is the gown he designed in 1977 for Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee portrait which, he said, was \"immortalised on a thousand biscuit tins.\" Knighted in 1989, Amies held the warrant until 1990, when he gave it up so that younger designers could create for the Queen.\n\nIn May 1973, Amies sold the business to Debenhams, who had themselves purchased Hepworths which distributed the Hardy Amies line. Amies purchased the business back in 1981. In May 2001, Amies sold his business to the Luxury Brands Group. He retired at the end of that year, when Moroccan-born designer Jacques Azagury became head of couture. In November 2008, after going bankruptcy, the Hardy Amies brand was acquired by Fung Capital, the private investment arm of Victor and William Fung, who together control the Li & Fung group.\nThe current collection is overseen by design director Mehmet Ali. The Hardy Amies name is still licensed globally, particularly in Japan.\n\nMeredith Etherington-Smith wrote: \"Nutter was a gentle humorist who had a wide and interesting circle of friends attracted by his enthusiasm, by his gentle, self-mocking personality and his acerbic comments on the vagaries of others, always ending with the expression 'But who am I to talk?'.\"\n\n\nModernisation, which had begun in 1969 with Nutters of Savile Row, had slowed by the early 1990s, so Savile Row tailors were \"struggling to find relevance with an audience that had grown increasingly disassociated\". Three 'New Generation' designers are credited with keeping Savile Row ahead of the times: they were Ozwald Boateng, Timothy Everest (a former apprentice of Nutter's) and Richard James. Having each broken away independently from the Savile Row mould, public relations professional Alison Hargreaves coined the term \"New Bespoke Movement\" to describe collectively the work of this \"new generation\" of tailors. Interest reached a peak in 1997 when the three were featured together in \"Vanity Fair\". The issue, entitled \"Cool Britania\", portrayed the tailors as the forefront of nineties style and design. The newcomers altered their shop fronts and utilised marketing and publicity to their advantage. For example, when Richard James (tailor) opened its Savile Row store in 1992, it introduced Saturday opening, something of a revolution to Savile Row at that time. Eight years later in 2000, Richard James (tailor) opened a new shop with large plate glass windows that allowed customers to see inside.\n\nThe new generation challenged the traditional Savile Row styling, bringing twists and \"a fine sense of colour to bespoke suits.\" They were seen to \"push the envelope of modern suit making and bespoke active wear, creating more contemporary silhouettes with bolder fabrics.\" Unlike the older establishments, this new generation of tailors set out to garner celebrity clients, disseminate their products via supermarket chains and attract wider national and international custom, raising the profile of their new tailoring style. In 2001 Richard James (tailor) was awarded the title Menswear Designer of the Year by the British Fashion Council, following that up in 2008 with the Bespoke Designer of the Year award, in recognition of its contribution to British tailoring. Boateng received the French Trophee de la Mode for Best Male Designer in 1996.\n\n\nIn an interview with Another Magazine in 2012, Sargent stated: \"Really I wanted to be a skilled worker rather than just a designer. I wanted to be able to fit something perfectly.\" Continuing, \"If you know how things are made and know the potential possibilities, you can be more creative. Where else do you learn that except for Savile Row?\" \"Savile Row has changed so much – I was lucky to come in at a time when it was changing. Now I just want to concentrate on doing really good bespoke work and on making my own contribution to the history of the Row\". When being interviewed by The Daily Telegraph in 2013, she observed: \"Women know how to make men look good in suits - most men consult their wives or girlfriends or mistresses... Women are accepted in medicine and in law; why not tailoring? I hope equality will become so not an issue that soon we won't be able to believe that it ever was.\"\n\n\n\n\nAs of November 2014, there are only two family-owned tailoring houses left on Savile Row, namely Dege & Skinner and Henry Poole & Co. Managing Director of D&S William G. Skinner, when interviewed by The Business of Fashion (BofF) website, stated: \"Ready-to-wear has been available on the Row for some time, but recession and a tough economic climate have led some retailers further down the road of ready-to-wear...\" Although in recent years the global luxury menswear market has grown at roughly double the pace of luxury womenswear, the tailors of Savile Row face the stark reality that bespoke tailoring is simply not a scalable business.\n\nHow different companies compete in the forthcoming years will vary. Starting with the 150-year-old company Dege & Skinner, William Skinner points out the young people involved: the future generation of tailors, serving apprenticeships within the trade. He stated in an interview to The Guardian: \"That highlights our belief in the future of the bespoke tailoring business. We have invested in the future of the trade, because we are confident about the future of the trade. We have a good business model; we make money and we reinvest it in the company. We are not a museum piece by any means.\" He continued: \"A lot of people don’t want to go into a high street shop, they want the relationship and the service that we give. As long as we can maintain that, there’s every chance of surviving.\"\n\nAt Gieves & Hawkes (G&H), founded in 1771, the approach differs. In 2012, G&H was bought up by Trinity Ltd., part of Hong Kong's Fung Capital, the private equity partnership of Victor and William Fung, the chairman and group managing director of Li & Fung, the world’s largest supplier to consumer brands of clothing. Ray Clacher, Chief Executive of G&H, stated in an interview to The BofF: \"In the last 12 months, we have [become] a more style-driven, less suit-dependent company than we have been in the past... We have hired in excess of 40 new heads just to look after design, production and development and merchandising.\" He continued: \"We have opened seventeen stores and we have certainly spent over £10 million in terms of pure hardware — going into digital, websites for Japan, China, the UK.\"\n\nPatrick Grant, designer and owner since 2005 of bespoke tailor Norton & Sons and its sister ready-to-wear line E. Tautz, stated to The BofF : \"The simple truth is that there are opportunities to sell ready-to-wear clothes thanks to Savile Row’s history.\" He continued: \"Personally as someone who has a business on both sides, I would like to see anything with a Savile Row name on it actually made on Savile Row... If you have got ten thousand suits being made by hand on Savile Row, but you have got a million suits somewhere in a factory in Asia also called Savile Row, I don’t think it can do anything other than hurt the business here.\"\n\nKilgour & French was taken over by the company '14 Savile Row', a subsidiary of Fung Capital, in 2013. 14 Savile Row also owns Hardy Amies and Norman Hartnell. They managed to re-install Carlo Brandelli as Creative Director, who had resigned when Kilgour was taken over by in 2008 by JMH Lifestyle. According to Brandelli, Savile Row has been invigorated, but he stated to The Daily Telegraph: \"It has changed over the last few years but it is still not enough.\" He continued: \"Too many of the tailors are like the wrong kind of museum.\"\n\nHuntsman's Roubi L’Roubi is adamant that ready-to-wear is crucial to the survival of the Row. He stated to the website Economia: \"There’s a way of carrying the traditions and modernising. They are not mutually exclusive.\" He also broaches the subject of the dwindling proportion of female customers: today it accounts for less than 5% at Poole, Huntsman and Gieves & Hawkes. He states: \"It’s because women want instant purchases. They want to buy it, take it home and wear it that evening.\" At present, the companies that advertise as bespoke tailors for women include: Nooshin, Katherine Maylin, King & Allen and Kathryn Sargent.\n\nHenry Poole & Co. are wanting to expand into China. In an interview with CNBC, Simon Cundey, director of Henry Poole & Co, stated: \"We've had a number of customers who have ordered in London and want the attention to detail we offer them and we hope that by bringing that option to Beijing we can grow the market there.\" Henry Poole & Co already has two stores in China through a partnership; however tailors make the framework for the suit in London and send it over to be assembled in a Chinese factory.\n\nIn November 2016, SR was given special planning rules within the City of Westminster by the introduction of 'Special Policy Areas'. These new planning rules include four other areas and will \"make it far harder for developers and landlords to dilute their distinctive character by allowing “clone” chain stores to force out smaller independent businesses.\" Mark Henderson of G&H and chairman of SR Bespoke Association is quoted as saying \"I’m absolutely delighted. It’s recognition that Savile Row is totally unique.\"\n\nWestminster policy 'CM2.3: Savile Row Special Policy Area' states: \"The Savile Row Special Policy Area (SPA) is home to a historic concentration of bespoke tailoring, with the street name in itself acting as a widely recognised international brand, synonymous with the unique and high quality bespoke and discreet, personal service it offers.\" It also states: \"Encouraging bespoke tailoring uses in the Savile Row SPA will continue to support this cluster of bespoke tailoring activities and the wider bespoke tailoring industry in Westminster and the UK.\"\n\nCouncillor Robert Davis said: \"Like a good suit, planning policy should be made to measure.\" Also: \"We are using our powers to protect some of the capital’s most valuable assets and create environments where specialist traders can thrive.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Ting Yuan Wai sends tax collectors and boxers to Hsiao’s fishing vessel but the fisherman refuses because the tax is illegal and the river had run dry. There's no fish for him to be taxed on. Two swashbucklers named Li Chun and Ni Jung help Hsiao En. The now bloodied Boxers escape and report to Ting Yuan Wai. For his transgression, Hsiao is whipped.
