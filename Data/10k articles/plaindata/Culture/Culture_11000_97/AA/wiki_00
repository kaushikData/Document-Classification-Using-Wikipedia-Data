{"id": "15907199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15907199", "title": "Art education in the United States", "text": "Art education in the United States\n\nArt education in the United States reflects the social values of American culture. Apprenticeship was once the norm and the main sense, however with the democratization of education, particularly as promoted by educational philosopher John Dewey, opportunities have greatly expanded. Elliot Eisner has been an influential advocate for the benefits of art in the schools.\n\nEnrollment in art classes at the high-school elective level peaked in the late 1960s to the early 1970s with that period's emphasis on individuals expressing uniqueness. Currently \"art magnet schools\", available in many larger communities, use art(s) as a core or underlying theme to attract those students motivated by personal interest or with the intention of becoming a professional or commercial artist. It is widely reported that the arts are losing instruction time in school based upon budget cuts in combination with increasing test-based assessments of children which the federal government's No Child Left Behind (NCLB) act requires. The NCLB retains the arts as part of the \"core curriculum\" for all schools, it does not require reporting any instruction time or assessment data for arts education content or performance standards, which is reason often cited for the decline or possible decline of arts education in American public schools.\n\nArt appreciation in America accelerated with the \"picture study movement\" in the late 19th century. The movement began to fade at the end of the 1920s. Picture study was an important part of the art education curriculum. Attention to the aesthetics in classrooms led to public interest in beautifying the school, home, and community, which was known as “Art in Daily Living”. The idea was to bring culture to the child to change the parents.\n\nPicture study was made possible by the improved technologies of reproduction of images, growing public interest in art, the Progressive Movement in education, and growing numbers of immigrant children who were more visually literate than they were in English. The type of art included in the curriculum was from the Renaissance onward, but nothing considered “modern art” was taught. Often, teachers selected pictures that had a moral message. This is because a major factor in the development in aesthetics as a subject was its relationship to the moral education of the new citizens due to the influx of immigrants during the period. Aesthetics and art masterpieces were part of the popular idea of self culture, and the moralistic response to an artwork was within the capabilities of the teacher, who often did not have the artistic training to discuss the formal qualities of the artwork.\n\nA typical Picture Study lesson was as follows: Teachers purchased materials from the Perry Picture Series, for example. This is similar to the prepackaged curriculum we have today. These materials included a teacher’s picture that was larger for the class to look at together, and then smaller reproduction approximately 2 ¾” by 2” for each child to look at. These were generally in black and white or sepia tone. Children would often collect these cards and trade them much like modern day baseball cards. The teacher would give the students a certain amount of information about the picture and the artist who created it, such as the picture’s representational content, artist’s vital statistics, and a few biographical details about the artist. These were all included in the materials so an unskilled teacher could still present the information to his or her class. Then the teacher would ask a few discussion questions. Sometimes suggestions for language arts projects or studio activities were included in the materials.\n\nThe picture study movement died out at the end of the 1920s as a result of new ideas regarding learning art appreciation through studio work became more popular in the United States.\n\nSince World War II, artist training has become the charge of colleges and universities and contemporary art has become an increasingly academic and intellectual field. Prior to World War II an artist did not need a college degree. Since that time the Bachelor of Fine Arts and then the Master of Fine Arts became recommended degrees to be a professional artist, necessities facilitated by \"the passage of the G.I. Bill in 1944, which sent a wave of World War II veterans off to school, art school included. University art departments quickly expanded. American artists who might once have studied at bohemian, craft-intensive schools like the Art Students League as Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Helen Frankenthaler, Robert Rauschenberg, Lee Bontecou, Al Held, Eva Hesse, Roy Lichtenstein, Donald Judd, James Rosenquist, Cy Twombly and hundreds of others did or Black Mountain College as John Chamberlain, Kenneth Noland, Robert Rauschenberg, and others did or the Hans Hofmann School of Art in Greenwich Village whose students included Joan Mitchell, Helen Frankenthaler, Lee Krasner and Larry Rivers among others; began enrolling at universities instead. By the 60s, The School of Visual Arts, Pratt Institute, and Cooper Union in New York City and other art schools across the country like the Kansas City Art Institute, the San Francisco Art Institute, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, as well as Princeton and Yale had emerged as the leading American art academies; its alums included Roxy Paine, Robert Mapplethorpe, Beverly Pepper, Lee Krasner, R.B. Kitaj, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Elizabeth Peyton, Joseph Kosuth, Dan Christensen, Peter Reginato, Robert Graham, Michael Heizer, Ronald Davis, Karen Finley, Jason Rhoades, Ronnie Landfield, Elizabeth Murray, Claes Oldenburg, Leon Golub, Jeff Koons, Joan Jonas, Ellsworth Kelly, Larry Poons, Frank Stella, Michael Fried, Walter Darby Bannard, Chuck Close, Brice Marden, Richard Serra, Eva Hesse, Jennifer Bartlett, John Currin, and Robert Mangold, making it seem as if every hip artist in New York was obligated to have a college degree or an Ivy League degree\". This trend spread from the United States around the world.\n\nCurrently, the PhD in studio art is under debate as the new standard as the terminal degree in the arts. Although in 2008 there are only two United States programs offering a PhD in studio art, \"10 universities offer the degree in Australia, and it is ubiquitous in the UK, Scandinavia, the Netherlands and other countries. It is already expected for a teaching job in Malaysia\". As James Elkins, the chair of the department of art history, theory and criticism at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago as well as the chair of the department of art history at the University of Cork in Ireland wrote in Art in America, \"By the 1960s the MFA was ubiquitous. Now the MFA is commonplace and the PhD is coming to take its place as the baseline requirement for teaching jobs\". This is in reference to teaching positions for studio art at the college level. The PhD has been a standard requirement to be a professor of art education for many years. In his forthcoming book, \"Artists with PhD's\", James Elkins (art critic) presents the opinion the PhD will become the new standard, and offers the book as a resource for assessing these programs and for structuring future programs. However, the College Art Association still recognizes the MFA as the terminal degree, stating \"At this time, few institutions in the United States offer a PhD degree in studio art, and it does not appear to be a trend that will continue or grow, or that the PhD will replace the MFA\".\n\nDiscipline-based art education (DBAE) is an educational program formulated by the J. Paul Getty Trust in the early 1980s. DBAE supports a diminished emphasis on studio instruction, and instead promotes education across four disciplines within the arts: aesthetics, art criticism, art history and art production. It does retain a strong tie to studio instruction with an emphasis on technique.\n\nAmong the objectives of DBAE are to make arts education more parallel to other academic disciplines, and to create a standardized framework for evaluation. It was developed specifically for grades K-12 but has been instituted at other levels of education. DBAE advocates that art should be taught by certified teachers, and that \"art education is for all students, not just those who demonstrate talent in making art\".\n\nCriticism of DBAE is voiced from postmodern theorists who advocate for a more pluralistic view of the arts, and inclusion of a diverse range of viewpoints that may not be included in a standardized curriculum.\n\nIn the 1970s, provisions for arts in education were limited, at the discretion of individual states. Local schools, school boards, and districts were the main actors in deciding whether arts education was provided. Where art education was offered, it consisted of exposure-based experiences with cultural organizations outside of the school and was not integrated into classroom curriculum. In the next couple decades, budget cuts as a result of fiscal crises heavily stripped school budgets to the point where positions for art teachers were essentially eliminated in order to retain core subjects. At this time, arts was seen as nonessential to the development of critical thinking and there did not exist a standard curriculum for teaching art in public schools. As such, provisions were scarce if at all present in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nHowever, the significance of an arts education emerged as data found academic performance improvements and socio-emotional and socio-cultural benefits, among other positive effects, stemming from the stimulative nature of the arts. Key players in advocating for and providing art education included a blend of public entities (school, government agencies, etc.), private organizations, and community centers.\n\nThis emerging acknowledgement of the importance of art education was matched by a decline in provisions at the beginning of the 19th century. With the implementation of NCLB, public schools prioritized meeting Academic Performance Index (API) growth targets, downgrading the emphasis on non-core subjects. For example, in California public schools, while enrollment increased by 5.8% from 1999 to 2004, music education decreased by 50% in the same 5-year period. On a national level, data from the Surveys of Public Participation in the Arts (SPAAs) showed that in 2008, 18-24 year olds were less likely to have had an arts education than in 1982. Low-income and low-performing public schools disproportionately struggled with this decline, and African-American and Latino students are generally less able to access the arts when compared to their White counterparts.\n\nThese findings of drastic declines in art education provisions spurred efforts for reinvestment. The NEA declared goals including maximizing investment impact, collaboration with local education across levels of government, and offering guidance and leadership support for art education.\n\nToday, funding for education in the United States comes from three levels; local level, state level and federal level. The whole system of education is kept in the hands of public sector for control and to avoid any mishandling. Recently, the U.S. Department of Education began awarding Arts in Education Model Development and Dissemination grants to support organizations with art expertise in their development of artistic curricula that helps students to better understand and retain academic information. One such model of education was created in 2006 by the Storytellers Inc. and ArtsTech (formerly Pan-Educational Institute). The curricula and method of learning is titled AXIS.\n\nThe National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) is one of the many nationally recognized organizations promoting arts education in the United States. Since its formation in 1965, the NEA has led efforts in integrating the arts as a part of the core education for all K-12 students. These efforts include collaborating in state, federal, and public-private partnerships to solicit and provide funding and grants for programs in arts education. During the 2008 fiscal year, the NEA awarded over 200 grants totaling $6.7 million to programs that allow students to engage and participate in learning with skilled artists and teachers. The NEA has initiated a number of other arts education partnerships and initiatives, which include:\n\n\nThere are a variety of other National organizations promoting arts education in the United States. These include Americans for the Arts which features major projects such as The Arts. Ask For More. national arts education public awareness campaign, Association for the Advancement of Arts Education, College Art Association; and National Art Education Association.\n\nArts integration is another and/or alternative way for the arts to be taught within schools. Arts integration is the combining of the visual and/or performing arts and incorporating them into the everyday curriculum within classrooms. Learning in a variety of ways allows for students to use their eight multiple intelligences as described by theorist Howard Gardner in his \"Frames of Mind: Theory of Multiple Intelligences\". The eight multiple intelligences include bodily-kinesthetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal, linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, naturalist, and spatial. Arts integration is especially important today when some schools no longer have or have small arts education programs due to significant budget cuts, including the federal budget agreement that took $12.5 million from the NEA, the United State's largest public arts funder, in 2011.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In some of such pairs, the place of articulation is additionally changed (see distinctive features below).

While Terra Preta soil patterns occur all over the Brazilian lowland, this site is extremely well developed and also scientifically surveyed and documented \n\nThe tertiary highland is composed of some clay layers (Belterra clay) of kaolinitic sediments of a Pliocene lake, with a distinct escarpment to the North and West of the plain, which leads down to the Várzea forest lowland at the river bank of the Tapajos river.\n\nThe municipality holds part of the Tapajós National Forest, a sustainable use conservation unit created in 1974.\n\nC analyses based on Terra Preta ceramic artefacts found in Belterra showed, that this area was populated and cultivated by the indigenous population in an intensive way at least since 500 B.C.\n\nBelterra was founded as a rubber plantation, after the economic failure of Fordlândia, which had been founded in 1934 by Henry Ford. The intention of the US-Department of Commerce in the 1920s was to produce rubber in Brazil and to import it to USA. The advantage of the Belterra plantation over the plantation of Fordlândia to the south is the flat topography, which enables the use of machinery. In its peak time in the late 1930s some were cultivated with \"Hevea brasiliensis\" (rubber tree). \n\nIn Belterra, new breeding methods with local varieties were applied, which prevented the leaf disease, a result of the monoculture in Fordlândia. This was very labour-intensive and therefore expensive. Together with the worldwide decline on demand on natural rubber, the plantation was not cost-effective anymore. Ford sold it to the Brazilian government, which is still running the plantation under EMBRAPA.\n\nToday, the area of the plantation is some covered extensively with mainly old rubber trees. It still gives the impression of a plantation with some 1000 - 2000 inhabitants (mainly plantation workers and their families). At the peak time, it had a population of some 8 - 10,000 people. According to a 2010 census, the entire district population, including surrounding villages, is reported as 16,324.\n\n"}
{"id": "170822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170822", "title": "Boll weevil", "text": "Boll weevil\n\nThe boll weevil (\"Anthonomus grandis\") is a beetle which feeds on cotton buds and flowers. Thought to be native to Central Mexico, it migrated into the United States from Mexico in the late 19th century and had infested all U.S. cotton-growing areas by the 1920s, devastating the industry and the people working in the American South. During the late 20th century, it became a serious pest in South America as well. Since 1978, the Boll Weevil Eradication Program in the U.S. allowed full-scale cultivation to resume in many regions.\n\nThe adult insect has a long snout, is grayish color, and is usually less than 6 mm long.\n\nAdult weevils overwinter in well-drained areas in or near cotton fields,and farms after diapause. They emerge and enter cotton fields from early spring through midsummer, with peak emergence in late spring, and feed on immature cotton bolls. \n\nThe boll weevil lays its eggs inside buds and ripening bolls (fruits) of the cotton plants. The female can lay up to 200 eggs over a 10- to 12-day period. The oviposition leaves wounds on the exterior of the flower bud. The eggs hatch in 3 to 5 days within the cotton squares (larger buds before flowering), feed for 8 to 10 days, and finally pupate. The pupal stage lasts another 5 to 7 days. The lifecycle from egg to adult spans about three weeks during the summer. Under optimal conditions, 8 to 10 generations per season may occur.\n\nBoll weevils begin to die at temperatures at or below −5 °C (23 °F). Research at the University of Missouri indicates they cannot survive more than an hour at −15 °C (5 °F). The insulation offered by leaf litter, crop residues, and snow may enable the beetle to survive when air temperatures drop to these levels. </br>\nOther limitations on boll weevil populations include extreme heat and drought. Its natural predators include fire ants, insects, spiders, birds, and a parasitic wasp, \"Catolaccus grandis\". The insects sometimes emerge from diapause before cotton buds are available.\n\nThe insect crossed the Rio Grande near Brownsville, Texas, to enter the United States from Mexico in 1892 and reached southeastern Alabama in 1909. By the mid-1920s, it had entered all cotton-growing regions in the U.S., travelling 40 to 160 miles per year. It remains the most destructive cotton pest in North America. Since the boll weevil entered the United States, it has cost U.S. cotton producers about $13 billion, and in recent times about $300 million per year.\n\nThe boll weevil contributed to the economic woes of Southern farmers during the 1920s, a situation exacerbated by the Great Depression in the 1930s.\n\nThe boll weevil appeared in Venezuela in 1949 and in Colombia in 1950. The Amazon Rainforest was thought to present a barrier to its further spread, but it was detected in Brazil in 1983, and an estimated 90% of the cotton farms in Brazil are now infested. During the 1990s, the weevil spread to Paraguay and Argentina. The International Cotton Advisory Committee has proposed a control program similar to that used in the U.S.\n\nDuring early years of the weevil's presence, growers sought relatively warm soils and early-ripening cultivars. Following World War II, the development of new pesticides such as DDT enabled U.S. farmers again to grow cotton as an economic crop. DDT was initially extremely effective, but U.S. weevil populations developed resistance by the mid-1950s. Methyl parathion, malathion, and pyrethroids were subsequently used, but environmental and resistance concerns arose as they had with DDT, and control strategies changed.\n\nWhile many control methods have been investigated since the boll weevil entered the United States, insecticides have always remained the main control methods. In the 1980s, entomologists at Texas A&M University pointed to the spread of another invasive pest, the red imported fire ant, as a factor in the weevils' population decline in some areas.\n\nOther avenues of control that have been explored include weevil-resistant strains of cotton, the parasitic wasp \"Catolaccus grandis\", the fungus \"Beauveria bassiana\", and the Chilo iridescent virus. Genetically engineered Bt cotton is not protected from the boll weevil.\n\nAlthough it was possible to control the boll weevil, to do so was costly in terms of insecticide costs. The goal of many cotton entomologists was to eventually eradicate the pest from U. S. cotton. In 1978, a large-scale test was begun in eastern North Carolina and in Southampton County, Virginia, to determine the feasibility of eradication. Based on the success of this test, area-wide programs were begun in the 1980s to eradicate the insect from whole regions. These are based on cooperative effort by all growers together with the assistance of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nThe program has been successful in eradicating boll weevils from all cotton-growing states with the exception of Texas, and most of this state is free of boll weevils. Problems along the southern border with Mexico have delayed eradication in the extreme southern portions of this state. Follow-up programs are in place in all cotton-growing states to prevent the reintroduction of the pest. These monitoring programs rely on pheromone-baited traps for detection. The boll weevil eradication program, although slow and costly, has paid off for cotton growers in reduced pesticide costs. This program and the screwworm program of the 1950s are among the biggest and most successful insect control programs in history.\n\nThe Library of Congress American Memory Project contains a number of oral history materials on the boll weevil's impact.\n\nA 2009 study found \"that as the weevil traversed the American South [in the period 1892-1932], it seriously disrupted local economies, significantly reduced the value of land (at this time still the most important asset in the American South), and triggered substantial intraregional population movements.\"\n\nThe boll weevil infestation has been credited with bringing about economic diversification in the Southern US, including the expansion of peanut cropping. The citizens of Enterprise, Alabama, erected the Boll Weevil Monument in 1919, perceiving that their economy had been overly dependent on cotton, and that mixed farming and manufacturing were better alternatives.\n\nThe boll weevil is the mascot for the University of Arkansas at Monticello and is listed on several \"silliest\" or \"weirdest\" mascots of all time. It was also the mascot of a short-lived minor league baseball team, the Temple Boll Weevils, which were alternatively called the \"Cotton Bugs.\"\n\n\"Boll Weevil\" is a traditional blues song which reached #2 on the Billboard chart in 1961.\n\nIn the original 1980s \"Transformers\" cartoon series, Decepticon character Bombshell's alternative form is loosely based on the Boll Weevil.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Bruces are kitted out in khakis, slouch hats and a cork hat and are faculty members of the Philosophy Department at the fictional University of Woolamaloo. (N.B. there is no such place as Woolamaloo in Australia but Woolloomooloo is an inner suburb of Sydney. There is no university there, though the real-life University of Sydney is not far away.)\n\nThe Bruces themselves first appeared in the Bruces sketch which featured in episode 22 \"How to Recognise Different Parts of the Body\" of the TV show \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", first broadcast on 24 November 1970. The sketch shows an English academic (played by Terry Jones) coming to a hot and perhaps remote part of Australia and being inducted by the Bruces (Cleese, Chapman, Idle and Palin) into their Philosophy Department, seemingly located in a simple wooden shack. The Bruces are lounging around a wooden table and soon start drinking cans of Foster's Lager.\n\nThe song was not part of the TV sketch; it first appeared on the Monty Python's 1973 album \"Matching Tie and Handkerchief\" as a coda for the album version of the sketch. The song was subsequently included in most of the Monty Python team's live shows, sometimes as a singalong with musical accompaniment provided by a Jew's harp.\n\nThe song's lyrics make a series of scandalous allegations about a number of highly respected philosophers, usually with regard to their capacity or incapacity for imbibing intoxicating beverages.\n\nThere is some debate over whether the sixth line is supposed to be \"Schopenhauer and Hegel\" or just \"Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel\". The reason for the confusion is that existing live recordings of the song (included in the \"Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl\" film and on the albums \"Live at Drury Lane\" and \"Live at City Center\") have the \"Schopenhauer and Hegel\" version, while the studio recording on \"Matching Tie and Handkerchief\" features the \"Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel\" version. However, the publication of the lyrics with the release of \"Monty Python Sings\" suggests that the \"Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel\" version is the official one. (The reason for the change of lyric may be that the philosopher in question's name is actually \"Georg\" Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and that Georg is pronounced in German with two syllables (GAY-org) making it difficult for the philosopher's full name to fit in the song.)\n\nAll the philosophers whom the song mentions were dead by the time it appeared, apart from Martin Heidegger.\n\nPhilosophers mentioned in the song (in order):\n\n\nSome of the philosophers are portrayed according to their works.\n"}

The Authority enforces Host policy via militarized police called Homeland Security and nicknamed the \"Redhats\".\n\nThe Hosts took control on a day known simply as the \"Arrival\". Late that day, massive rectangular blocks descended from the sky, linking together to build walls dividing the city. One of these walls, 20 to 30 stories tall, many meters thick, and many miles in length, surrounds the central part of Los Angeles, where the series is set. Other similar walls have been constructed around neighbouring urban areas, called \"blocs\", with the whole referred to as a \"colony\". Traffic passes through the walls at heavily secured checkpoints, called \"gateways\", which allow the Authority to strictly control the movement of people and the distribution of consumables, such as food and fuel, which are rationed. The geographical extent of the alien invasion is unclear, but it is presumably worldwide.\n\nA privileged class of elites, drawn by the Hosts from the local population, are denigrated by some bloc residents as collaborators. The ruling forces maintain control through the separation of loved ones, shoot-on-sight curfews, forced disappearances, random checkpoints, frequent electronic identity checks, limitation of motor vehicle usage (most people walk or ride bicycles), pervasive visual propaganda, slave labor in a place called the \"Factory\", and electronic surveillance with Host-provided drone aircraft that launch from the wall. Some medical problems, such as diabetes, have been \"deemed unworthy for treatment\" by the Hosts, to cull the population.\n\nA resistance movement is referred to as both the \"Resistance\" and the \"Insurgency\". An informal barter-based black market has also sprung up, trading in surplus materials and home-produced goods.\n\nIn the second season, it is revealed that a large organization, known as the Global Authority, stands between the Transitional Authorities of the colonies and the Hosts. In flashbacks, it is revealed that before the Arrival an organization called the \"Institute for Global Advancement\" was collaborating with the Hosts, recruiting suitable people for the Transitional Authority.\n\nIn the third season, it is revealed that the Hosts are actually an extraterrestrial group of humanoid alien robots and their true agenda is revealed; the Hosts ran away from their planet, after being attacked by an unknown alien species, meaning there is another enemy, even worse than the Hosts. They came to Earth looking for allies against this alien species.\n\nThe series begins less than a year after the Arrival. It follows the Bowmans and their extended family. Their son Charlie was on a school sports trip and was separated from them when the walls came down. The father, Will Bowman, is a former FBI agent and retired Army Ranger who reluctantly joins the Redhats and is tasked with tracking down members of the resistance, after being threatened that he and his family would be sent to the Factory if he did not comply. Unbeknownst to Will, his wife Katie is a Resistance operative. She later reveals this, and they begin to trade information. Their son Bram discovers a way under the wall, and later joins a rival Resistance group.\n\n\n\nThe show has received generally positive reviews. On Metacritic it holds a score of 69/100, based on 22 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a score of 80%, based on 24 reviews with an average rating of 6.4/10. The critics' consensus reads: \"\"Colony\" offers an engaging enough narrative, a few scares, and an overall good time, even if none of it is particularly original.\"\n\nStephen King praised the series saying: \"In a year of remarkable TV, \"Colony\" is really something special: smart, suspenseful, subversive... thought-provoking.\"\n\n"}

L. Zamenhof published his constructed language under the pseudonym Dr Esperanto in 1887. It immediately became popular, but soon people were making suggestions as to how they thought it might be improved. Zamenhof responded by making a list of possible changes to Esperanto and in 1894 put them before the Esperanto community. If accepted they would create what Dr Zamenhof called \"a Reformed Esperanto\". This proposed reformed Esperanto is sometimes referred to as Esperanto 1894. However, when the Esperanto community was invited to vote on whether to adopt the proposals, they rejected the proposals by a large majority.\n\nIdo was created around a quarter of a century after Esperanto. The name Ido means \"offspring\" in Esperanto and was so named by its creators because it was a development of Esperanto. The creation of Ido led to a schism between those who believed that Esperanto should be left as it was and those who believed that it had what they perceived as inherent flaws which made it not quite good enough to be the world's international auxiliary language. Those who opposed change maintained that it was endless tinkering that had led, in their opinion, to the decline of Volapük a once popular constructed language that had predated Esperanto's publication by a few years. They would also surely have pointed out that Dr Zamenhof's reform proposals of 1894 had been rejected by popular vote.\n\nThe languages of Esperanto and Ido remain close, and largely mutually intelligible, like two dialects of the same language. Just as dialects of a language are quite often sources of new words for that language through literature, so Ido has contributed many neologisms to Esperanto (especially in poetic substitutes for long words using the \"mal-\" prefix).\n\nOne study conducted with 20 college students at Columbia University circa 1933 suggests that Esperanto's system of correlative words is easier to learn than Ido's. Two other studies by the same researchers suggest no significant overall difference in difficulty of learning between Esperanto and Ido for educated American adults, but the sample sizes were again small: in the two tests combined, only 32 test subjects studied Ido. The researchers concluded that additional comparative studies of Esperanto and Ido are needed.\n\nCalls for specific reforms to Esperanto were made almost from the beginning, and so Dr. L. L. Zamenhof published suggestions for reform in 1894. Publication took the form of a series of four articles (including a list of words singled out for possible change) in La Esperantisto monthly magazine, under the title \"Pri Reformoj en Esperanto.\" It was put to the vote whether this should be implemented in full or in part, or reworked or rejected. A big majority voted to reject it outright. It seems likely that, having learned Esperanto, speakers did not want to unlearn it. Because so many voted no Dr Zamenhof took no further interest in changing Esperanto and concentrated instead on the work of \"Fundamenta Esperanto\".\n\nIt was a time of great interest in constructed languages and several people published artificial languages of their own creation. It was obviously desirable that one from among the constructed languages should be chosen as \"the\" international language. In 1900 Louis Couturat, a French mathematician, after initial correspondence with Dr L. L. Zamenhof created the Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language. The Delegation approached the International Association of Academies, based in Vienna, in 1907, requesting it to choose between the many artificial languages. This request was denied. The Delegation's response was to meet later that year (1907) in Paris as a committee under the chairmanship of Louis Couturat with the intention of deciding the issue themselves.\n\nOne of the languages under consideration was, of course, Esperanto. Zamenhof did not give permission to reprint his articles detailing his \"Esperanto1894\" suggestions but a reprint was made and circulated, perhaps predisposing Committee members to think in terms of a \"reformed\" Esperanto. (There were 200 copies, distributed personally. Alas, lost on the net and not in archive.org). The Committee began its deliberations to choose an international auxiliary language from among the several entries. Most Esperantists assumed Esperanto would win easily. However, an anonymous entry was submitted at the last moment (against the rules) detailing a reformed version of Esperanto, which may have impressed the Committee. Louis Couturat as chairman demanded the Committee finalize its business within a month, and only five members were involved in making the final decision. Of the five, one abstained and four voted for Esperanto but said it must be reformed.\n\nMany in the Esperanto movement felt betrayed. It later was discovered that the anonymous last-minute entrant was Louis de Beaufront, previously the chairman of the French Esperanto movement and chosen by Dr Zamenhof himself to present the case for Esperanto. People believed Louis Couturat had been well aware of what was going on. To this day there is much bewilderment in both the Esperanto and Ido communities about the rules and proceedings of the Committee. \n\nDr Zamenhof refused to be involved in making changes to Esperanto but a group led by Louis Couturat elaborated on Ido as a \"Reformed Esperanto\". There was much bitterness on both sides. Louis Couturat polemicised against Esperanto until his tragic early death in a car crash in 1914. His loss was a great setback to those who wished to spread Ido. \n\nNot everyone involved in creating Ido was satisfied with it. Many former Idists, such as Otto Jespersen (who created Novial) left the movement, bleeding Ido of leaders.\n\nOf all synthetic auxiliary languages, only Esperanto and Interlingua-IL de ApI gained a sizeable following and textual corpus to this day.\n\nEsperanto is based on the \"Fundamento de Esperanto\" by L. L. Zamenhof; whereas the grammar of Ido is explained in the \"Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza di la Linguo Internaciona Ido\". \n\nSince Esperanto has proved to be a living, stable language, nowadays Esperantists are less quick to reject influences from Ido. Probably the most fundamental of these is that Esperantists have copied Idists in clarifying the rules for word derivation. In addition, modern Esperanto has borrowed the suffixes -oz- (meaning \"abundant in\") and -end- (meaning \"required to\") from Ido. \n\nEspecially poets have used the Ido equivalents of Esperanto's \"mal-\" word class (\"Contrary of\").\n\nOne difference between the two languages is that Ido has an extra utrum third person singular pronoun, i.e. that means \"he or she\". For various reasons, this is seen as desirable in Esperanto too by many Esperantists. \n\nSome Esperantists have suggested \"ri\" as a replacement for all singular 3rd person pronouns. The suggested innovation is called \"riismo\", but the total replacement of li, ŝi and ĝi is seen too radical. When used as a simple addition to existing pronouns, Riismo has phonetic problems (\"l\" and \"r\" are pronounced by native speakers of Mandarin or Japanese in such a way that it can be hard to distinguish them – a fact that made Rev. Schleyer omit the \"r\" from Volapük – and this is \"especially\" so if the two words differentiating are \"li\" and \"ri\"). \n\nIn 1967, however, Manuel Halvelik already included the additional utrum \"egui\"/\"gi\" in Arcaicam Esperantom (keeping \"li\" as masculine pronoun), thus inadvertently founding \"Giismo\". \n\nThe third possibility, to keep the utric aspect of \"li\" and incept a new masculine pronoun (e.g. \"hi\"), is the proposal of the attempts of the \"Hiismo\"-class. \n\nAn attempt to elevate the neutrum \"ĝi\" as utrum has not gained acceptance at all, as a ne-utrum (\"none of both\") is the contrary of the desired utrum (\"any of both\").\n\nOther suggested innovations such as Iĉismo are more acceptable and are discussed among Esperantists. The Volapük experience still is a factor in the \"protectionism\" of Esperantists, but no longer predominant; however, as many \"ConLangers\" mistake Esperanto as an \"artistic ConLang\" to be changed as one sees fit instead as a living, employed \"synthetic IAL/LAI\" and try to invent \"reforms\" a dime a dozen, proposals for change are seen in Esperanto still with much more suspicion than in \"natural languages\". \n\nThe present day attitude is shown by the Esperanto Encyclopedia where it states that \"reforms\", i.e. changing the fundaments of a language, have never been successful neither in Esperanto nor anywhere else, while \"evolution\" through use \"enriches languages\".\n\nIdo omits two consonants used in Esperanto, and , opting to use the similar sounds and exclusively.\n\nIdo's rule for determining stress is regular, but more complex than Esperanto's. In Esperanto, all words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable: radio, televido. In Ido all polysyllables are stressed on the second-to-last syllable except for verb infinitives, which are stressed on the last syllable—skolo, kafeo and lernas for \"school\", \"coffee\" and the present tense of \"to learn\", but irar, savar and drinkar for \"to go\", \"to know\" and \"to drink\". If an i or u precedes another vowel, the pair is considered part of the same syllable when applying the accent rule—thus radio, familio and manuo for \"radio\", \"family\" and \"hand\", unless the two vowels are the only ones in the word, in which case the \"i\" or \"u\" is stressed: dio, frua for \"day\" and \"early\".\n\nEsperanto eliminates the letters ‹q›, ‹w›, ‹x›, and ‹y› from the 26-letter Latin alphabet and adds the new letters ‹ĉ›, ‹ĝ›, ‹ĥ›, ‹ĵ›, ‹ŝ› and ‹ŭ›. Ido uses the 26-letter alphabet without changes, substituting digraphs for Esperanto's diacritics. While words in both Ido and Esperanto are spelled exactly as they are pronounced, the presence of digraphs means that Ido does not have the one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds that Esperanto has. However, Ido's digraphs are more recognizable to speakers of Romance languages and its avoidance of diacritics guarantees that any computer system that supports English could easily be used for Ido.\n\nThe \"Fundamento de Esperanto\" does allow the use of the digraphs ‹ch›, ‹gh›, ‹hh›, ‹jh›, ‹sh› and the single letter ‹u› instead of the ordinary diacritical letters of Esperanto when those are unavailable. With the advent of computers, another system of surrogate Esperanto writing using ‹cx›, ‹gx›, ‹hx›, ‹jx›, ‹sx› and ‹ux› was introduced. It however remains unofficial.\n\nIn general, the letter \"ĥ (the guttural sound)\" in Esperanto becomes \"h\" or \"k\" in Ido. The letters \"ĝ\" and \"ĵ\" are merged into \"j\" (which has the sound of \"s\" in \"leisure\") while \"ĉ\", \"ŝ\", \"ŭ\", \"ks\"/\"kz\", and \"kv\" respectively become \"ch\", \"sh\", \"w\", \"x\", and \"qu\".\n\nBoth in Ido and in Esperanto, each word is built from a root word. A word consists of a root and a grammatical ending. Other words can be formed from that word by removing the grammatical ending and adding a new one, or by inserting certain affixes between the root and the grammatical ending.\n\nSome of the grammatical endings of the two languages are defined as follows:\n\nMost of these endings are the same as in Esperanto except for \"-i\", \"-ir\", \"-ar\", \"-or\" and \"-ez\". Esperanto marks noun plurals by an \"agglutinative\" ending \"-j\" (so plural nouns end in \"-oj\"), uses \"-i\" for verb infinitives (Esperanto infinitives are tenseless), and uses \"-u\" for the imperative. Verbs in both Esperanto and Ido do not conjugate depending on person, number or gender; the -as, -is, and -os endings suffice whether the subject is I, you, he, she, they, or anything else.\n\nBoth languages have the same grammatical rules concerning nouns (ending with -o), adjectives (ending with -a) and many other aspects. (However, the relationship between nouns, verbs and adjectives underwent a number of changes with Ido, based on the principle of reversibility.) In both languages one can see a direct relationship between the words \"multa\" \"many\" and \"multo\" \"a multitude\" by simply replacing the adjectival \"-a\" with a nominal \"-o\", or the other way around.\n\nSome minor differences include the loss of adjectival agreement, and the change of the plural from an agglutinative \"-j\" tacked onto the end to a synthetic replacement of the terminal \"-o\" with an \"-i\". Hence, Esperanto \"belaj hundoj\" (\"beautiful dogs\") becomes Ido \"bela hundi\". Ido also does away with the direct object ending \"-n\" in sentences where the subject precedes the object, so Esperanto \"mi amas la belajn hundojn\" (\"I love the beautiful dogs\") would in Ido become \"me amas la bela hundi\".\n\nGreater differences arise, however, with the derivations of many words. For example, in Esperanto, the noun \"krono\" means \"a crown\", and by replacing the nominal \"o\" with a verbal \"i\" one derives the verb \"kroni\" \"to crown\". However, if one were to begin with the verb \"kroni\", \"to crown\", and replace the verbal \"i\" with a nominal \"o\" to create a noun, the resulting meaning would not be \"a coronation\", but rather the original \"crown\". This is because the root \"kron-\" is inherently a noun: With the nominal ending \"-o\" the word simply means the thing itself, whereas with the verbal \"-i\" it means an action performed with the thing. To get the name for the performance of the action, it is necessary to use the suffix \"-ado\", which retains the verbal idea. Thus it is necessary to know which part of speech each Esperanto root belongs to.\n\nIdo introduced a number of suffixes in an attempt to clarify the morphology of a given word, so that the part of speech of the root would not need to be memorized. In the case of the word \"krono\" \"a crown\", the suffix \"-izar\" \"to cover with\" is added to create the verb \"kronizar\" \"to crown\". From this verb it is possible to remove the verbal \"-ar\" and replace it with a nominal \"-o\", creating the word \"kronizo\" \"a coronation\". By not allowing a noun to be used directly as a verb, as in Esperanto, Ido verbal roots can be recognized without the need to memorize them.\n\nIdo corresponds more overtly to the expectations of the Romance languages, whereas Esperanto is more heavily influenced by Slavic semantics and phonology.\n\nIdo word order is generally the same as Esperanto (subject–verb–object). The sentence \"Mi havas la blua libro\" is the same as the Esperanto \"Mi havas la bluan libron\" (\"I have the blue book\"), both in meaning and word order. There are a few differences, however:\n\nUnlike Esperanto, Ido does not impose rules of grammatical agreement between grammatical categories within a sentence. Adjectives don't have to be pluralized: in Ido \"the large books\" would be \"la granda libri\" as opposed to \"la grandaj libroj\" in Esperanto.\n\nAlthough Esperanto and Ido share a large amount of vocabulary, there are differences. The creators of Ido felt that much of Esperanto was either not internationally recognizable, or unnecessarily deformed, and aimed to fix these with more \"international\" or \"corrected\" roots. This can sometimes be at the expense of Esperanto's simpler word building process.\n\nIdo, unlike Esperanto, does not assume the male gender in roots such as for family. For example, Ido does not derive the word for \"waitress\" by adding a feminine suffix to \"waiter\", as Esperanto does to derive it from neutral to only feminine. Instead, Ido words are defined as gender neutral, and two different suffixes derive masculine and feminine words from the root: \"servisto\" for a waiter of any gender, \"servistulo\" for a male waiter, and \"servistino\" for a waitress. There are only two exceptions to this rule: First, \"patro\" for \"father\", \"matro\" for \"mother\", and \"genitoro\" for \"parent\", and second, \"viro\" for \"man\", \"muliero\" for \"woman\", and \"adulto\" for \"adult\".\n\nBelow are some examples in first Esperanto then Ido with English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese for linguistic comparison:*\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>[Note that Spanish, Portuguese, and French are Romance languages, while German and English are Germanic languages. English has also had large influences from French and Latin. In comparison, Esperanto is somewhat more influenced by German vocabulary and Slavic semantics (as in the case of prefix mal-) and has more priority over word compounding by affixes.]\n\nAnother principle of Ido is \"Unasenceso\" or \"one sensedness.\" This means each Ido root is supposed to correspond to only one meaning. Ido proponents feel that this allows for more precise expression than in Esperanto.\n\nIdo claims the prefix \"mal-\" (creating a word with the exact opposite meaning) in Esperanto to be overused as a prefix, and also to be inappropriate since it has negative meanings in many languages, and introduces \"des-\" as an alternative in such cases. Ido also uses a series of opposite words in lieu of a prefix. For example, instead of \"malbona\" (\"bad\", the opposite of \"bona\", \"good\"), Ido uses \"mala\", or instead of \"mallonga\" (\"short\", the opposite of \"longa\", \"long\"), \"kurta\". Listening comprehension was also given as a reason: the primary Ido grammar book states that one reason for the adoption of the Latin-based \"sinistra\" for \"left\" instead of \"maldextra\" (\"mal-\" plus the word \"dextra\", or \"dekstra\" for \"right\") is that often only the last one or two syllables can be heard when shouting commands. Esperanto has developed alternate forms for many of these words (such as \"liva\" for \"maldekstra\"), but most of these are rarely used.\n\nAn extreme example of overuse of the \"mal-\" suffix.\nMost Esperanto words are gender-neutral (\"table\", \"grass\", etc.). However, Esperanto assumes the male gender by default in other words, mainly words dealing with familial relationships and some animals. These words can be made female with the use of the feminine suffix. In Ido there is no default gender for normal root words, and one simply adds the corresponding masculine or feminine suffix only when desired. For example, \"frato\" means \"brother\" in Esperanto, but \"sibling\" in Ido. Ido uses the suffixes \"-ino\" (\"female\", used as in Esperanto) and \"-ulo\" (\"male\", not to be confused with the same Esperanto suffix which means \"person\"). Thus \"sister\" is \"fratino\" (the same as Esperanto), but brother is \"fratulo\". \"Sibling\" and other gender neutral forms are especially difficult in Esperanto since Esperanto simply does not have a word for such gender neutral forms. Esperanto does, however, have an epicene prefix that indicates \"both sexes together\": \"ge-\". \"Patro\" means \"father\" and \"patrino\" \"mother\"; \"gepatroj\" means \"parents\". In standard usage \"gepatro\" cannot be used in the singular to indicate a parent of unknown gender; one would say instead \"unu el la gepatroj\", \"one (out) of the parents\".\n\nThere is a nonstandard suffix in Esperanto that means \"male\": \"-iĉo\" (see Gender reform in Esperanto). There is also an existing prefix, \"vir-\", with the same meaning, used for animals.\n\nA few exceptions exist in Ido's gender system as described above, which avoid its suffix system, for which it was decided that the feminine words were so much more recognizable to its source languages: \"viro\" (\"man\"), \"muliero\" (\"woman\"), \"patro\" (\"father\"), and \"matro\" (\"mother\"). Compare these with Esperanto \"viro\", \"virino\", \"patro\", and \"patrino\", respectively. Ido also has several other neutral-gender words, such as \"genitoro\" for \"parent\". \"Gepatri\" in Ido means the same as Esperanto \"gepatroj\" (i.e. \"parents\" of both genders); \"genitori\" means \"parents\" in the English sense, not making any implication of gender whatsoever.\n\nOther words, such as \"amiko\" (\"friend\"), are neutral in Esperanto as well as Ido.\n\nEsperanto adopts a regular scheme of correlatives organized as a table. Ido combines words together and changing word endings with some irregularities to show distinction, which is not as regular as that of Esperanto but is better distinctable by ear.\n\nThe Ido correlatives were changed so it would be better distinctable when hearing.\n\nnote: \"ĉiujn tiujn, kiuj(n)\" (all those, which) is more commonly said as \"ĉiujn, kiuj(n)\" (all, which) in Esperanto.\n\nComparison of how long it took to learn the correlatives between Esperanto and Ido was studied at Columbia University circa 1933:\n\nThe pronouns of Ido were revised to make them more acoustically distinct than those of Esperanto, which all end in \"i\". Especially the singular and plural first-person pronouns \"mi\" and \"ni\" may be difficult to distinguish in a noisy environment, so Ido has \"me\" and \"ni\" instead. Ido also distinguishes between intimate (\"tu\") and formal (\"vu\") second-person singular pronouns as well as plural second-person pronouns (\"vi\") not marked for intimacy. Furthermore, Ido has a pan-gender third-person pronoun \"lu\" (it can mean \"he\", \"she\", or \"it\", depending on the context) in addition to its masculine (\"il\"), feminine (\"el\"), and neuter (\"ol\") third-person pronouns.\n\n\"Ol\", like English \"it\" and Esperanto \"ĝi\", is not limited to inanimate objects, but can be used \"for entities whose sex is indeterminate: \"babies, children, humans, youths, elders, people, individuals, horses, cows, cats,\" etc.\"\n\nAs Esperanto was created in the Russian Empire, \"ci\"/\"tu\" in Esperanto and Esperanto1894 are used / to be used only in very familiar circles and towards children and intellectually inferior creatures/humans; its use faced to a colleague or outside of the family can be seen as outright insulting. Therefore, \"ci\" is omitted in most basic grammars, as many Esperantists will use their native tongue in situations where \"ci\"/„tu\" were appropriate.\n\nEsperanto may or may not \"Esperantize\" names and proper nouns, depending on many factors. Most standard European names have equivalents, as do many major cities and all nations. Ido, on the other hand, treats most proper nouns as foreign words, and does not render them into Ido.\n\nMany common cross-culture European names have Esperanto equivalents, such as \"Johano\" (John, Johann, Juan, Jean, etc.), \"Aleksandro\" (Alexander, Aleksandr, Alessandro, etc.), \"Mario\" or \"Maria\" (Mary, Maria, Marie, etc.), among others. Some Esperanto speakers choose to take on a fully assimilated name, or to at least adjust the orthography of their name to the Esperanto alphabet. Others leave their name completely unmodified. This is regarded as a personal choice, and the Academy of Esperanto officially affirmed this proclaiming that \"everyone has the right to keep their authentic name in its original orthography, as long as it is written in Latin letters.\"\n\nPersonal names in Ido, on the other hand, are always left unmodified.\n\nMost countries have their own names in Esperanto. The system of derivation, though, is sometimes complex. Where the country is named after an ethnic group, the main root means a person of that group: \"anglo\" is an Englishman, \"franco\" is a Frenchman. Originally, names of countries were created by the addition of the suffix \"-ujo\" (\"container\"), hence England and France would be rendered \"Anglujo\" and \"Francujo\" respectively (literally \"container for Englishmen/Frenchmen\"). More recently, many Esperantists have adopted \"-io\" as the national suffix, thus creating names more in line with standard international practice (and less odd-looking): \"Anglio\", \"Francio\", nevertheless the suffix remains unofficial.\n\nIn the New World, where citizens are named for their country, the name of the country is the main word, and its inhabitants are derived from that: \"Kanado\" (\"Canada\"), \"kanadano\" (\"Canadian\").\n\nNames of cities may or may not have an Esperanto equivalent: \"Londono\" for London, \"Nov-Jorko\" for New York. Place names which lack widespread recognition, or which would be mangled beyond recognition, usually remain in their native form: Cannes is usually rendered as \"Cannes\".\n\nIn Ido, country names must conform to the language's orthography but otherwise are left unchanged: \"Europa\", \"Peru\", \"Amerika\". City names are treated as foreign words (London), except when part of the name itself is a regular noun or adjective: Nov-York (\"Nov\" for \"nova\", or \"new\", but the place name York is not changed as in Esperanto \"Nov-Jorko\"). This is not a hard and fast rule, however, and \"New York\" is also acceptable, similar to writing \"Köln\" for the city of \"Cologne\" in Germany. South Carolina becomes Sud-Karolina, much in the same way that a river called the \"Schwarz River\" is not transcribed as the \"Black River\" in English even though \"schwarz\" is the German word for \"black\". However, less well-known place names are generally left alone, so a small town by the name of \"Battle River\" for example would be written the same way, and not transcribed as \"Batalio-rivero\". This is because transcribing a little-known place name would make it nearly impossible to find in the original language.\n\nEsperanto and Ido were compared in studies at Columbia University circa 1933:\n\nEsperanto is estimated to have approximately 100,000 to 2 million fluent speakers. In the same manner estimates for the number of Ido speakers are far from accurate, but 500 to a few thousand is most likely. It is also important to note the distinction between the number of speakers compared to the number of supporters; the two languages resemble each other enough that a few weeks of study will enable one to understand the other with little difficulty, and there are a number of people that have learned Ido out of curiosity but prefer to support the larger Esperanto movement and vice versa.\nThe number of participants at the respective international conferences is also much different: Esperanto conferences average 2000 to 3000 participants every year whereas Ido conferences have around 10 participants each year. Each language also has a number of regional conferences during the year on a much less formal basis, and with smaller numbers.\n\nThe Lord's Prayer:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5517287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5517287", "title": "Deconstructivism", "text": "Deconstructivism\n\nDeconstructivism is a movement of postmodern architecture which appeared in the 1980s, which gives the impression of the fragmentation of the constructed building. It is characterized by an absence of harmony, continuity, or symmetry. Its name comes from the idea of \"Deconstruction\", a form of semiotic analysis developed by the French philosopher Jacques Derrida. Architects whose work is often described as deconstructionism (though in many cases the architects themselves reject the label) include Peter Eisenman, Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas, Daniel Libeskind, Bernard Tschumi, and Coop Himmelb(l)au. \n\nBesides fragmentation, Deconstructivism often manipulates the structure's surface skin and creates by non-rectilinear shapes which appear to distort and dislocate elements of architecture. The finished visual appearance is characterized by unpredictability and controlled chaos.\n\nDeconstructivism came to public notice with the 1982 Parc de la Villette architectural design competition, in particular the entry from Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman and the winning entry by Bernard Tschumi, as well as the Museum of Modern Art’s 1988 \"Deconstructivist Architecture\" exhibition in New York, organized by Philip Johnson and Mark Wigley. Tschumi stated that calling the work of these architects a \"movement\" or a new \"style\" was out of context and showed a lack of understanding of their ideas, and believed that Deconstructivism was simply a move against the practice of Postmodernism, which he said involved \"making doric temple forms out of plywood\".\n\nOther influential exhibitions include the 1989 opening of the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, designed by Peter Eisenman. The New York exhibition has featured works by Frank Gehry, Daniel Libeskind, Rem Koolhaas, Peter Eisenman, Zaha Hadid, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Bernard Tschumi. Since their exhibitions, some architects associated with Deconstructivism have distanced themselves from it; nonetheless, the term has stuck and has come to embrace a general trend within contemporary architecture.\n\nThe term \"Deconstructivism\" in contemporary architecture is opposed to the ordered rationality of Modernism and Postmodernism. Though postmodernist and nascent deconstructivist architects both published in the journal \"Oppositions\" (between 1943 and 1954), that journal's contents mark a decisive break between the two movements. Deconstructivism took a confrontational stance to architectural history, wanting to \"disassemble\" architecture. While postmodernism returned to embrace the historical references that modernism had shunned, possibly ironically, deconstructivism rejected the postmodern acceptance of such references, as well as the idea of ornament as an after-thought or decoration.\n\nIn addition to \"Oppositions\", a defining text for both deconstructivism and postmodernism was Robert Venturi's \"Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture\" (1966). It argues against the purity, clarity and simplicity of modernism. With its publication, functionalism and rationalism, the two main branches of modernism, were overturned as paradigms. The reading of the postmodernist Venturi was that ornament and historical allusion added a richness to architecture that modernism had foregone. Some Postmodern architects endeavored to reapply ornament even to economical and minimal buildings, described by Venturi as \"the decorated shed.\" Rationalism of design was dismissed but the functionalism of the building was still somewhat intact. This is close to the thesis of Venturi's next major work, that signs and ornament can be applied to a pragmatic architecture, and instill the philosophic complexities of semiology.\n\nThe deconstructivist reading of \"Complexity and Contradiction\" is quite different. The basic building was the subject of problematics and intricacies in deconstructivism, with no detachment for ornament. Rather than separating ornament and function, like postmodernists such as Venturi, the functional aspects of buildings were called into question. Geometry was to deconstructivists what ornament was to postmodernists, the subject of complication, and this complication of geometry was in turn, applied to the functional, structural, and spatial aspects of deconstructivist buildings. One example of deconstructivist complexity is Frank Gehry's Vitra Design Museum in Weil-am-Rhein, which takes the typical unadorned white cube of modernist art galleries and deconstructs it, using geometries reminiscent of cubism and abstract expressionism. This subverts the functional aspects of modernist simplicity while taking modernism, particularly the international style, of which its white stucco skin is reminiscent, as a starting point. Another example of the deconstructivist reading of \"Complexity and Contradiction\" is Peter Eisenman's Wexner Center for the Arts. The Wexner Center takes the archetypal form of the castle, which it then imbues with complexity in a series of cuts and fragmentations. A three-dimensional grid, runs somewhat arbitrarily through the building. The grid, as a reference to modernism, of which it is an accoutrement, collides with the medieval antiquity of a castle. Some of the grid's columns intentionally don't reach the ground, hovering over stairways creating a sense of neurotic unease and contradicting the structural purpose of the column. The Wexner Center deconstructs the archetype of the castle and renders its spaces and structure with conflict and difference.\n\nSome Deconstructivist architects were influenced by the French philosopher Jacques Derrida. Eisenman was a friend of Derrida, but even so his approach to architectural design was developed long before he became a Deconstructivist. For him Deconstructivism should be considered an extension of his interest in radical formalism. Some practitioners of deconstructivism were also influenced by the formal experimentation and geometric imbalances of Russian constructivism. There are additional references in deconstructivism to 20th-century movements: the modernism/postmodernism interplay, expressionism, cubism, minimalism and contemporary art. Deconstructivism attempts to move away from the supposedly constricting 'rules' of modernism such as \"form follows function,\" \"purity of form,\" and \"truth to materials.\"\n\nThe main channel from deconstructivist philosophy to architectural theory was through the philosopher Jacques Derrida's influence with Peter Eisenman. Eisenman drew some philosophical bases from the literary movement Deconstruction, and collaborated directly with Derrida on projects including an entry for the Parc de la Villette competition, documented in \"Chora l Works\". Both Derrida and Eisenman, as well as Daniel Libeskind were concerned with the \"metaphysics of presence,\" and this is the main subject of deconstructivist philosophy in architecture theory. The presupposition is that architecture is a language capable of communicating meaning and of receiving treatments by methods of linguistic philosophy. The dialectic of presence and absence, or solid and void occurs in much of Eisenman's projects, both built and unbuilt. Both Derrida and Eisenman believe that the locus, or place of presence, is architecture, and the same dialectic of presence and absence is found in construction and deconstructivism.\n\nAccording to Derrida, readings of texts are best carried out when working with classical narrative structures. Any architectural deconstructivism requires the existence of a particular archetypal \"con\"struction, a strongly-established conventional expectation to play flexibly against. The design of Frank Gehry’s own Santa Monica residence, (from 1978), has been cited as a prototypical deconstructivist building. His starting point was a prototypical suburban house embodied with a typical set of intended social meanings. Gehry altered its massing, spatial envelopes, planes and other expectations in a playful subversion, an act of \"de\"construction\"\n\nIn addition to Derrida's concepts of the metaphysics of presence and deconstructivism, his notions of trace and erasure, embodied in his philosophy of writing and arche-writing found their way into deconstructivist memorials. Daniel Libeskind envisioned many of his early projects as a form of writing or discourse on writing and often works with a form of concrete poetry. He made architectural sculptures out of books and often coated the models in texts, openly making his architecture refer to writing. The notions of trace and erasure were taken up by Libeskind in essays and in his project for the Jewish Museum Berlin. The museum is conceived as a trace of the erasure of the Holocaust, intended to make its subject legible and poignant. Memorials such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial and Peter Eisenman's Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe are also said to reflect themes of trace and erasure.\n\nAnother major current in deconstructivist architecture takes inspiration from the Russian Constructivist and Futurist movements of the early twentieth century, both in their graphics and in their visionary architecture, little of which was actually constructed.\n\nArtists Naum Gabo, El Lissitzky, Kazimir Malevich, and Alexander Rodchenko, have influenced the graphic sense of geometric forms of deconstructivist architects such as Zaha Hadid and Coop Himmelb(l)au. Both Deconstructivism and Constructivism have been concerned with the tectonics of making an abstract assemblage. Both were concerned with the radical simplicity of geometric forms as the primary artistic content, expressed in graphics, sculpture and architecture. The Constructivist tendency toward purism, though, is absent in Deconstructivism: form is often deformed when construction is deconstructed. Also lessened or absent is the advocacy of socialist and collectivist causes.\n\nThe primary graphic motifs of constructivism were the rectangular bar and the triangular wedge, others were the more basic geometries of the square and the circle. In his series \"Prouns\", El Lizzitzky assembled collections of geometries at various angles floating free in space. They evoke basic structural units such as bars of steel or sawn lumber loosely attached, piled, or scattered. They were also often drafted and share aspects with technical drawing and engineering drawing. Similar in composition is the deconstructivist series \"Micromegas\" by Daniel Libeskind.\n\nTwo strains of modern art, minimalism and cubism, have had an influence on deconstructivism. Analytical cubism had a sure effect on deconstructivism, as forms and content are dissected and viewed from different perspectives simultaneously. A synchronicity of disjoined space is evident in many of the works of Frank Gehry and Bernard Tschumi. Synthetic cubism, with its application of found object art, is not as great an influence on deconstructivism as Analytical cubism, but is still found in the earlier and more vernacular works of Frank Gehry. Deconstructivism also shares with minimalism a disconnection from cultural references. \n\nWith its tendency toward deformation and dislocation, there is also an aspect of expressionism and expressionist architecture associated with deconstructivism. At times deconstructivism mirrors varieties of expressionism, neo-expressionism, and abstract expressionism as well. The angular forms of the Ufa Cinema Center by Coop Himmelb(l)au recall the abstract geometries of the numbered paintings of Franz Kline, in their unadorned masses. The UFA Cinema Center also would make a likely setting for the angular figures depicted in urban German street scenes by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. The work of Wassily Kandinsky also bears similarities to deconstructivist architecture. His movement into abstract expressionism and away from figurative work, is in the same spirit as the deconstructivist rejection of ornament for geometries.\n\nSeveral artists in the 1980s and 1990s contributed work that influenced or took part in deconstructivism. Maya Lin and Rachel Whiteread are two examples. Lin's 1982 project for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, with its granite slabs severing the ground plane, is one. Its shard-like form and reduction of content to a minimalist text influenced deconstructivism, with its sense of fragmentation and emphasis on reading the monument. Lin also contributed work for Eisenman's Wexner Center. Rachel Whiteread's cast architectural spaces are another instance where contemporary art is confluent with architecture. \"Ghost\" (1990), an entire living space cast in plaster, solidifying the void, alludes to Derrida's notion of architectural presence. Gordon Matta-Clark's \"Building cuts\" were deconstructed sections of buildings exhibited in art galleries.\n\nMark Wigley and Philip Johnson curated the 1988 Museum of Modern Art exhibition \"Deconstructivist architecture\", which crystallized the movement, and brought fame and notoriety to its key practitioners. The architects presented at the exhibition were Peter Eisenman, Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Coop Himmelblau, Rem Koolhaas, Daniel Libeskind, and Bernard Tschumi. Mark Wigley wrote the accompanying essay and tried to show a common thread among the various architects whose work was usually more noted for their differences.\n\nComputer aided design is now an essential tool in most aspects of contemporary architecture, but the particular nature of deconstructivism makes the use of computers especially pertinent. Three-dimensional modelling and animation (virtual and physical) assists in the conception of very complicated spaces, while the ability to link computer models to manufacturing jigs (CAM - Computer-aided manufacturing) allows the mass production of subtly different modular elements to be achieved at affordable costs. In retrospect many early deconstructivist works appear to have been conceived with the aid of a computer, but were not; Zaha Hadid's sketches for instance. Also, Gehry is noted for producing many physical models as well as computer models as part of his design process. Though the computer has made the designing of complex shapes much easier, not everything that looks odd is \"deconstructivist.\"\n\nSince the publication of Kenneth Frampton's \"Modern Architecture: A Critical History\" (first edition 1980) there has been a keen consciousness of the role of criticism within architectural theory. Whilst referencing Derrida as a philosophical influence, deconstructivism can also be seen as having as much a basis in critical theory as the other major offshoot of postmodernism, critical regionalism. The two aspects of critical theory, urgency and analysis, are found in deconstructivism. There is a tendency to re-examine and critique other works or precedents in deconstructivism, and also a tendency to set aesthetic issues in the foreground. An example of this is the Wexner Center. Critical Theory, however, had at its core a critique of capitalism and its excess, and from that respect many of the works of the Deconstructivists would fail in that regard if only they are made for an elite and are, as objects, highly expensive, despite whatever critique they may claim to impart on the conventions of design.\n\nThe difference between criticality in deconstructivism and criticality in critical regionalism, is that critical regionalism \"reduces\" the overall level of complexity involved and maintains a clearer analysis while attempting to reconcile modernist architecture with local differences. In effect, this leads to a modernist \"vernacular.\" Critical regionalism displays a lack of self-criticism and a utopianism of place. Deconstructivism, meanwhile, maintains a level of self-criticism, as well as external criticism and tends towards maintaining a level of complexity. Some architects identified with the movement, notably Frank Gehry, have actively rejected the classification of their work as deconstructivist.\n\nCritics of deconstructivism see it as a purely formal exercise with little social significance. Kenneth Frampton finds it \"elitist and detached\". Nikos Salingaros calls deconstructivism a \"viral expression\" that invades design thinking in order to build destroyed forms; while curiously similar to both Derrida's and Philip Johnson's descriptions, this is meant as a harsh condemnation of the entire movement. Other criticisms are similar to those of deconstructivist philosophy—that since the act of deconstructivism is not an empirical process, it can result in whatever an architect wishes, and it thus suffers from a lack of consistency. Today there is a sense that the philosophical underpinnings of the beginning of the movement have been lost, and all that is left is the aesthetic of deconstructivism. Other criticisms reject the premise that architecture is a language capable of being the subject of linguistic philosophy, or, if it was a language in the past, critics claim it is no longer. Others question the wisdom and impact on future generations of an architecture that rejects the past and presents no clear values as replacements and which often pursues strategies that are intentionally aggressive to human senses.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13023730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13023730", "title": "Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two", "text": "Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two\n\nEf: A Fairy Tale of the Two is a two-part Japanese adult visual novel series by Minori for Windows PCs. The first game in the series, \"Ef: The First Tale\", was released on December 22, 2006, and the second game, \"Ef: The Latter Tale\", was released on May 30, 2008. The opening video for the game was animated by Makoto Shinkai, and a majority of the music was produced by Tenmon, who has worked in the past with Shinkai and Minori. Female character design was by Naru Nanao of \"Da Capo\" fame, while male character design was by 2C Galore.\n\nBefore the release of \"Ef: The First Tale\", a manga based on the overall story was serialized between 2005 and 2015 starting in \"Dengeki Comic Gao\", but later transferred to \"Dengeki Daioh\". In addition, a light novel was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's \"Comptiq\" from July 2006 to July 2008. A 12-episode anime adaptation titled \"Ef: A Tale of Memories\" was produced by Shaft and aired between October and December 2007. A second season of the anime titled \"Ef: A Tale of Melodies\" aired 12 episodes between October and December 2008.\n\nOn September 26, 2010, it was announced that MangaGamer had acquired the rights of the visual novel for a worldwide English release, in partnership with the translation group No Name Losers. The English version of the two games were released in 2012 and 2013. The license holding company Sentai Filmworks licensed both \"Ef\" anime series.\n\nThe gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. The player has a chance to assume the role of four protagonists, two in each \"Ef: The First Tale\" and \"Ef: The Latter Tale\". Each protagonist is paired with a heroine, and each scenario in the original PC versions of the visual novels includes scenes with sexual content. These scenes are removed or modified in the PlayStation 2 port.\n\nEvery so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The plot lines carry on from each other in a linear fashion. The game can end prematurely if the player makes the wrong decisions. When this occurs, the player must go back to a previously saved spot and choose different decisions.\n\nFor \"Ef\", Minori attempted to create a movie-like experience, using a lot of animated two-dimensional computer graphics presented from various angles. Instead of presenting the visuals straight-on with a character's image in the middle of the screen and the character being the main focus, the character images in the \"Ef\" series are off-center and appear closer to \"event\" computer graphics (CGs) in typical visual novels. These types of CGs occur at certain pivotal times in a visual novel's story and are meant to be artistic and much more detailed than normal visuals.\n\n\"Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two\" consists of two parts. The first part is titled \"Ef: The First Tale\" and primarily consists of the story of Hiro Hirono, Miyako Miyamura, Kyosuke Tsutsumi, Kei Shindo, and Yuko Amamiya. It consists of a prologue and two main chapters with Miyako as the focus for the first chapter, and Kei for the second. This is followed by the second part of the story, \"Ef: The Latter Tale\", which primarily deals with the story of Renji Aso, Chihiro Shindo, Shuichi Kuze, Mizuki Hayama, and Yu Himura. The second part consists of two more main chapters and an ending chapter, with Chihiro as the focus for the third chapter, and Mizuki for the fourth. Bringing the two parts together forms the all-encompassing \"Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two\". The story is set in the town .\n\n, a mysterious girl dressed like a nun, and , a mysterious gentleman who is somehow attached to the church where Yuko first appears, are having a reunion in a church during Christmas time. Despite her attire, Yuko is not affiliated with the church. She always appears generally out of nowhere, and disappears just as quickly in various places throughout the story to talk with Hiro or other characters and give them advice. Yuko and Yu reminisce about the past and remember events of the previous year around the same time at the beginning of the first chapter of the story. Yuko hints of events that are revealed throughout \"Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two\". After the conclusion of the first chapter, the story cycles back to the prologue and the talk between Yuko and Yu. Yuko ends with her talk about the events in the first chapter. At the end of the second chapter, the story shifts again to the scene with Yuko and Yu. Yuko finishes her talk on the events from the second chapter and says that she misses talking to Hiro, Kyosuke, and their friends. Their talk ends with allusions to the continuation of the story, \"Ef: The Latter Tale\".\n\nThe first chapter's protagonist is , an already established manga author despite still attending high school. Due to the pressures of his work, he often skips school and puts most of his time into his job as a manga artist of shōjo manga under the pseudonym . Writing manga causes him to lose interest in school and focuses mainly on his work in order to earn an income, as usually he does not have much money as it is. While out one Christmas night, a purse snatcher rushes past Hiro on a bike and soon appears, chasing after the purse thief, taking Hiro's bike without asking to pursue the culprit. She ends up destroying his bike, and later hangs out with him for the rest of the night.\n\nHiro later meets Miyako again at school, and learns that she is a student of the same year there, but in a different class; she too does not attend classes much because she finds them boring. Miyako has an energetic personality and enjoys doing unorthodox things. She eventually starts to become attracted to Hiro after they start spending more time together, but during this time Hiro's childhood friend begins to feel left out and a love triangle develops between the three students. She is attracted to Hiro, and becomes jealous when she finds out how much time he is spending with Miyako Miyamura. Hiro and Miyako eventually become a couple, despite Kei's feelings for him.\n\nThe second chapter begins several months after the end of the first. It is now summer, and the story focuses on a new protagonist named . Kyosuke is an acquaintance of Hiro's and happens to be in the same grade and school. He has a passion for filming, and constantly carries a digital video recorder around with him. On Christmas night, he saw Kei Shindo, who is the main heroine of the second chapter, running down the street and tried to get a shot of her, but a truck passed by, so he could not get a clean shot of the mystery girl. After thinking about the mystery girl, he ends up quitting the film club and agrees with his girlfriend, Emi Izumi (\"voiced by:\" Kaori Nobiki (Japanese), Allison Sumrall (English)), to break up.\n\nOne day, while filming near the gymnasium, Kyosuke catches sight of Kei practicing basketball for her school's girls' basketball team and becomes infatuated by her image. He desires to cast Kei in an amateur film he is making for an upcoming film festival. Occupied with thoughts of Kei, he sets out determined to get closer to Kei by becoming better friends with Hiro, Kei's childhood friend. Kei is one year younger than Hiro and she attends the same school as him too. After being asked to be cast in one of his films, Kei initially refuses Kyosuke's offer, but agrees to watch some of his previous films. While initially put off by the films, she eventually comes to like aspects of his work. After hanging out together more, the two eventually fall in love and go out together.\n\n\"Ef: The Latter Tale\" begins once again with Yuko Amamiya and Yu Himura in the middle of a reunion in a church during Christmas time. Yuko tells Yu how she has influenced people in two separate stories (from \"Ef: The First Tale\"). After she is done with this, she asks him to tell her about the people he has influenced. Yu starts to tell his first story, that of Chihiro Shindo; the third chapter begins. Like Yuko, Yu also abruptly appears out of nowhere and disappears just as mysteriously. He often gives advice and warnings to Renji and others. Yu is close to Chihiro and takes care of her. After the conclusion of the third chapter, the story goes back to Yuko and Yu with Yu ending his recount of the third chapter, and goes on to talk about how he and Yuko were separated in the past. Yu starts his recount of the events from the fourth chapter. At the end of the fourth chapter, the story shifts one final time back to Yuko and Yu. Up to this point the two have been recounting individual tales to each other. The meaning of the overall title \"Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two\" is revealed to be in connection with Yuko and Yu.\n\nLike the first chapter, the third chapter is also set in winter, but now focuses on another protagonist named who is half German, half Japanese. One day, he goes to an abandoned train station in town he would often frequent to read at since it is so quiet there and meets a girl wearing an eyepatch over her left eye and sitting alone named . Chihiro is the younger twin sister of Kei Shindo from \"Ef: The First Tale\" and the main heroine of the third chapter in the story. Despite them being mutually shy, Renji comes back to see her at the station every day after school and quickly becomes friends with her. Renji later learns that she has a severe case of anterograde amnesia, where she can only remember 13 hours' of memory at a time, aside from the events before the accident that led to her current state, which she can recall perfectly. Now, she carries a diary with her which she writes in every day the events of that day so that the next day, after she had forgotten everything, she will be able to remind herself of what happened the previous day. Ironically, she has a fantastic memory of anything that happened that is less than thirteen hours old.\n\nRenji also finds out that it is her dream to write a fantasy novel, but due to her condition has never been able to get far. Renji loves to read novels, and after discussing it with Chihiro, he collaborates with her to see if he can finally make her dream come true. Through the process of writing the novel, the two eventually become very close and they fall in love with each other. As the story progresses and more of the novel is written, Renji soon discovers that the novel is an allegory for Chihiro's life and how she sees the world around her due to the state of her limited memory.\n\nPlanning for \"Ef\" started in 2004 headed by Nobukazu Sakai (also known as nbkz), who is the main producer for Minori. The director for \"Ef\" was Mikage, who was also one of the main scenario writers along with Yū Kagami. Character design for \"Ef\" was headed by two artists, Naru Nanao who drew the female characters, and 2C Galore who drew the males. The opening movie animation was done via a collaboration between the animation studio Ajia-do Animation Works and Makoto Shinkai. Music in the \"Ef\" series was provided by Tenmon, who was the sole composer for \"Ef: The First Tale\", and was accompanied by Eiichirō Yanagi for additional music used in \"Ef: The Latter Tale\". It cost Minori over 100 million yen to produce the \"Ef\" series.\n\nA fan disc entitled \"Ef: First Fan Disc\" was initially released during Comiket 72 between August 11 and August 13, 2007; the disc, playable on a PC was later sold in retail stores starting on August 25, 2007. The disc, unlike the normal visual novels in the series, did not contain adult content, and offered a glimpse into the world of \"Ef\", though only touched on points from \"Ef: The First Tale\", the first game in the series. \"Ef: The First Tale\" was released as an adult game for the PC on December 22, 2006. The second game in the series, \"Ef: The Latter Tale\" was released on May 30, 2008. MangaGamer released both games in English: \"Ef: The First Tale\" was released on July 27, 2012 and \"Ef: The Latter Tale\" was released on December 20, 2013.\n\nA game demo of \"Ef: The First Tale\" is available via a free download at Getchu.com's special website for \"Ef: The First Tale\". A second fan disc entitled \"Ef: Second Fan Mix\", released as a preview of \"Ef: The Latter Tale\", was initially released at during Comiket 73 on December 29, 2007; the disc, playable on a PC, was later sold in retail stores starting on February 8, 2008. A PlayStation 2 port combining \"The First Tale\" and \"The Latter Tale\" was released on April 29, 2010 published by Comfort. A fan disc titled was released on September 17, 2010.\n\nA manga adaptation titled \"Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two\" began serialization in the April 2005 issue of the shōnen manga magazine \"Dengeki Comic Gao!\" sold on February 27, 2005, published by MediaWorks. The manga ended serialization in the April 2008 issue \"Dengeki Comic Gao!\" at 35 chapters, but continued serialization in the June 2008 issue of ASCII Media Works' manga magazine \"Dengeki Daioh\" sold on April 21, 2008. After a lengthy hiatus, the manga ended serialization in the March 2015 issue. The story was written by Mikage and Yū Kagami, two scenario writers of Minori, and illustrated by Juri Miyabi. Ten \"tankōbon\" volumes were published under ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Comics imprint between February 27, 2006 and January 27, 2015.\n\nA series of 24 short side-stories in a light novel form were serialized under the title \"Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two Another Tale\" in Kadokawa Shoten's seinen magazine \"Comptiq\" between the July 2006 and July 2008 issues sold on June 10, 2006 and June 10, 2008, respectively. The stories are written by the same scenario staff as with the original games and manga, and illustration is handled by Naru Nanao, 2C Galore, and Mitsuishi Shōna. The chapters of \"Another Tale\" were released in a single volume on February 27, 2009 entitled \"Another Tales.\". Another two separate light novels, under the general title \"Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two\", were published by Fujimi Shobo on October 25, 2007. They were written by Yū Kagami, and illustrated by Kinusa Shimotsuki. The first novel was a novelization of Miyako's route, and the second was centered around Kei's route.\n\nThe \"Ef\" series, encompassing the visual novels and anime adaptation, was the only Minori title to receive coverage in an entire issue of \"Dengeki G's Festival! Deluxe\", a special edition version of \"Dengeki G's Magazine\" which is published by ASCII Media Works; the issue in question was the first, and was published on November 30, 2007. Along with information pertaining to \"Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two\" and \"Ef: A Tale of Memories\", the magazine came bundled with an ergonomic mousepad, a small cell phone cleaner which can also attach to a cell phone, and an ID card/pass case.\n\nThere are two Internet radio shows for \"Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two\" The first, entitled , was broadcast between October 13, 2006 to June 1, 2007 every Friday and was produced by Onsen, Cospa, and Minori. The show contained thirty-three episodes and was mainly used to promote the visual novels. In this way, the promotion mainly entailed news about the series and any updates related to the visual novels while also discussing points about the games themselves. The second radio broadcast began on June 8, 2007 called . This broadcast is mainly used to promote the anime series which entails reporting on updates related to the anime and goods for the anime including musical CDs or DVDs.\n\nA set of four drama CDs were released by Frontier Works based on the series between October 2006 and April 2007. A special edition drama CD was released on November 21, 2007, and another special drama CD was released on January 1, 2008. The first print release of the special edition CD will contain comments from the cast. The drama CDs used the same female cast as with the games and anime versions (albeit under assumed names), but the two males that appeared in the dramas, Hiro and Kyosuke, had different voice actors in respect to the anime version. Hiro was voiced by Takashi Shōman, and Kyosuke was by Shō Shiroki.\n\nOn August 24, 2007, a short prologue for an \"Ef\" anime series was released as a DVD. The prologue was a teaser which introduced the characters and some conflict that would appear in the series. The anime series, under the title \"Ef: A Tale of Memories\", aired 12 episodes on Chiba TV between October 7 and December 22, 2007. The anime was produced by Shaft and directed by Shin Ōnuma who volunteered for the job when it was offered. Even though the script for \"Ef: The Latter Tale\" was finished at the time of the anime's production, in order to direct the anime from the viewer's standpoint, Shin Ōnuma himself never read it. However, Katsuhiko Takayama who wrote the screenplay for the anime, had read the script. Each episode ends with a still image drawn by Japanese illustrators of anime, manga, and visual novels. The first letter in each episode's title, plus the \"coda\" title of the last episode, can be brought together to form \"Euphoric Field\". The series was released in six limited and regular edition DVD compilations, each containing two episodes. The first DVD volume was released on December 7, 2007, and the sixth DVD was released on May 9, 2008. A second season entitled \"Ef: A Tale of Melodies\" aired 12 episodes between October 7 and December 22, 2008 in Japan. The license holding company Sentai Filmworks licensed both \"Ef\" anime series. The DVD and Blu-ray Disc box sets of \"Ef: A Tale of Memories\" were released on January 31, 2012 in North America with an English dub, and the \"Ef: A Tale of Melodies\" box sets were released on March 20, 2012.\n\nThe opening theme song for \"Ef: The First Tale\" is by Hitomi Harada which was released as a maxi single called \"Eternal Feather\" on October 27, 2006. For \"Ef: The Latter Tale\", the opening theme is \"Emotional Flutter\", and the ending theme is \"Ever Forever\"; the single containing the two themes was released on April 11, 2008. \"Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two\" original soundtrack, \"Alato\", was released on February 27, 2009 containing three CDs. The PlayStation 2 version released by Comfort will include an image song CD in the game disc, which will contain a song called \"Echt Forgather\" by Hitomi Harada.\n\nThe opening theme for \"Ef: A Tale of Memories\", starting with episode three, is the English version of \"Euphoric Field\" by Tenmon featuring Elisa. The first episode used a background music track for the opening theme, and the second and tenth episodes had no opening theme; the English version of \"Euphoric Field\" was also used for the ending theme in episode two. The Japanese version of \"Euphoric Field\" was used as the opening theme for the twelfth episode. The opening theme single was released on October 24, 2007 by Geneon.

The anime received a mostly positive review from Bradley Meek THEM Anime Reviews. Bradley appreciated the animation, saying that \"It does wonders for the mood in the series, adding a tangible layer of mysticism and fantasy.\" However, he criticized the series being \"cheesy and melodramatic more often than not.\" He concluded the review saying, \"Despite some laughable melodrama, the raw emotions and Shaft's hypnotic animation makes \"ef ~a tale of memories~\" a memorable romance. The plotting is slow, though, so it's not for people with short attention spans.\"\n\n"}

The exact course is debated: perhaps near the Altar of Mars in the campus; or on the Tarentum, the site of the \"ludi tarentini\", which became the Saecular Games; or the Trigarium. When the Tiber flooded, the Equirria were transferred to the \"Campus Martialis\" on the Caelian Hill, a field without permanent structures.\n\nThe Equirria were said to have been founded by Romulus, the son of Mars. Both appear on the oldest Roman calendars inscribed on stone. The Equirria are part of what Michael Lipka calls \"temporal focalization\" in the Roman conception of deity. The festivals of Mars—the February 27 Equirria, a \"feria\" on the Kalends of March (a day sacred also to his mother Juno), Agonalia March 17, Tubilustrium March 23, the ritual of the October Horse October 15, and Armilustrium October 19—cluster at his namesake month (Latin \"Martius\"), except for festivals of Mars in October to close the military campaigning season.\n\nIn the earliest form of the calendar, the year began with March, and thus the February 27 Equirria originally preceded New Year's Day, and was the last festival for Mars of the year. The March 14 Equirria occurs the day before the Ides, when the Roman people celebrated the feast of Anna Perenna, whose name expresses her role as a goddess of the year (Latin \"annus\"; cf. English \"perennial\"). The March 14 Equirria and the Regifugium (\"King's Flight\") are the only such festivals to fall on an even-numbered date. Despite scholarly efforts, no explanation for this displacement has found wide acceptance. Georg Wissowa thought the March Equirria had originally occurred on the Ides, and was moved up a day because of conflicts among religious events concentrated around this ritually fraught time; an alternate view is that it was placed \"at some convenient day\" between the Nones and the Ides. At any rate, the horse races framed the ritual turn of the year, and the difficulties of the placement of the two Equirria arise from changes made to the calendar, when January became the first month.\n\nOriginally, the Equirria may have featured races on horseback, like the archaic festivals of the Consualia and Taurian Games, rather than chariot races. The gods of the underworld \"(di inferi)\" were characteristically propitiated by horse racing in the Campus Martius with \"old and obscure\" festivals such as the Consualia, at sites including the Tarentum and the Trigarium. Hendrik Wagenvoort speculated that the archaic Mars \"had been imagined as the god of death and the underworld in the shape of a horse.\"\n\nWilliam Warde Fowler understood the Equirria as \"lustrations of the horse\" for the army. They occur during what most scholars see as a general \"war festival\" for Mars. The end of the campaigning season was marked in October, with the ritual of the October Horse, which also involved chariot races, on the Ides, and the Armilustrium on October 19. The paucity of evidence on the Equirria, as with other archaic festivals, may indicate that they were preserved for the sake of religious tradition, but not attended by masses of people.\n"}

( stylized as ESTĒE LAUDER) is a multinational manufacturer and marketer of prestige skincare, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, based in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The company owns a diverse portfolio of brands, distributed internationally through both digital commerce and retail channels.\n\nThe company began in 1946 when Estée Lauder and her husband Joseph Lauder began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All purpose Creme, and Creme Pack. Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.\n\nOver the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac. In 1967, Estée Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors. This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968. In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique, a dermatologist-guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy-tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand.\n\nEstée Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called \"Skin Supplies for Men\", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly-traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins — the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton, an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).\n\nBrand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based M•A•C Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998. Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, designed by the celebrated makeup artist, was acquired in 1995, as was La Mer – along with the original recipe for its supreme luxury product, Crème de la Mer, containing the nutrient-rich Miracle Broth™. The company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The renowned fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.\n\nOn November 16, 1995, The Estée Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange at $26.00 a share ($6.50 on a post-split basis).\n\nAcquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as The Estée Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in Bumble & bumble, the trendy hair care salon, and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand.\n\nOn July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California, by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max).\n\nOn October 28, 2011, Aramis and Designer Fragrances, a division of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., and Tory Burch LLC announced the signing of a multiyear agreement for the exclusive worldwide license of the Tory Burch fragrance business. This partnership marked Tory Burch's first step into the beauty industry. The first Tory Burch fragrance products were introduced in 2013.\n\nIn 2012, the company launched AERIN Beauty, a luxury lifestyle beauty and fragrance brand inspired by the signature style of its founder, Aerin Lauder.\n\nIn 2014, the company acquired two insider beauty brands, RODIN olio lusso, a skin care brand renowned for its \"Luxury Face Oil,\" and Le Labo, a fragrance and sensory lifestyle brand. In 2015, the company acquired Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, a fragrance brand, and GLAMGLOW, a Hollywood skin care brand.\n\nIn 2016, the company acquired Becca Cosmetics, their first color cosmetic group acquisition since Smashbox in 2010. In November 2016, the company made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring California-based cosmetics company Too Faced for US$1.45 billion. The company subsequently promoted Israel Assa as vice president.\n\nThe Estée Lauder brand has had sometimes iconic spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Estée Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede was the first African American 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. the main spokesmodel for Estée Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda. In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski. \n\nIn 2015, Estée Lauder signed model and social media sensation Kendall Jenner to introduce a new generation of beauty enthusiasts to the brand.\n\nIn 2017, the company announced Violette Serrat as their Global Beauty Director.\n\nFor fiscal year 2016, the Estée Lauder Companies achieved net sales of $11.26 billion, a 4% increase compared with $10.78 billion in the prior year. Net earnings for the year were $1.11 billion, a 2% increase compared with $1.09 billion last year, and diluted net earnings per common share rose 5% to $2.96, compared with $2.82 reported in the prior year. As of 2018, Estée Lauder Companies ranked 258 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.\n\nCurrent members of the board of directors of Estée Lauder Companies Inc. are: Charlene Barshefsky, Rose Marie Bravo, Lynn Forester de Rothschild, Fabrizio Freda, Paul J. Fribourg, Wei Sun Christianson, Mellody Hobson, Irvine Hockaday, Jane Lauder, Leonard A. Lauder, Ronald S. Lauder, William P. Lauder, Richard Parsons, Barry Sternlicht and Richard F. Zannino.\nLeonard A. Lauder is chairman emeritus. William P. Lauder is executive chairman. Fabrizio Freda is president and chief executive officer.\n\nIn October 1992, the BCA campaign was launched by Evelyn Lauder (Estée's daughter in law) who co-created the \"Pink Ribbon\" with \"SELF\" magazine as a symbol of breast health. Since then, millions of people globally have heard the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can save lives.\nThe Estée Lauder Companies’ annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign involves all of the 18 brands that make up the Estée Lauder Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s first and largest corporate supporter. Estée's daughter-in-law created BCRF's signature pink ribbon.\n\nOver $10 million were raised for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation between 1993 and summer 2003. Another $1 million were raised from their retail partners between July 2002 and summer 2003.\n\nThe Estée Lauder Companies brands include:\nCosmetics\nFragrance\nHaircare\n\nEstée Lauder Companies appeared on lists of major companies supporting SOPA, the controversial, but unsuccessful, Congressional anti-piracy bill that was considered overreaching by critics.\n\nIn 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder's natural products brands. The contracted company was Common Sense Natural Soap & Bodycare, owned by a group led by cult leader Yoneq Gene Spriggs. Estee Lauder says it immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, claiming it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.\n\nThe Estée Lauder Companies performs non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. The Estée Lauder Companies does perform animal testing where required by law. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products. This causes controversy for smaller brands that are \"cruelty free\" but were bought out by Estée Lauder. Estée Lauder becomes the parent company of the smaller brand and profits through the smaller brand.\n\nSince at least February 2001, Estée Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign led by pro-Palestine activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder. In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their \"Estée Slaughter\" campaign. The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.\n\n"}

Three main umbrella groups, the Queensland Living History Federation (QLHF) and the Australasian Living History Federation (ALHF)and the Australian Re-enactors Association (ARA), formed to represent the interests of re-enactment and living history groups around Australia.\n\nThe Australasian Living History Federation was formed in 2002 and acts as a focus for historical re-enactment and living history societies portraying aspects of world history within Australia (except Queensland).\n\nThe Queensland Living History Federation (QLHF) formed in 1997 to represent the interests of re-enactors and living historians in Queensland. Member groups of the QLHF range from Ancient Rome to the Vietnam War era. Membership of QLHF is based on high standards of safety, authenticity, research and performance.\n\nThe Australian Re-enactors Association (ARA) formed in 2012 to represent members' focus on different historical periods and locations from the Classical Ancient world through to Australians in the Second World War. Aside from organising public liability insurance, the ARA also acts to represent members' interests in areas such as legislation that affects re-enactment activities.\nThe ARA offers members, event organisers and the public, advice and guidance on such things as performance and display safety and the reasonable presentation of historical accuracy in recreational re-enactment activities.\n\nThe Australasian Register of Living History Organisations (ARLHO) is a website that provides links to living history groups in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe Dark Ages, medieval, and Renaissance periods are popular eras for re-enactments, and the three largest events, as measured by participants, focus on these eras of history. 18th and 19th century re-enactment groups are also popular, and convey Australian interest in early colonial pre-federation military regiments. The history of the Australian Light Horse regiments are the area of Australian history with wide interest, with nearly 15 groups, the first starting in 1978 formed to reenact this period of military history. There is also some focus on the Australian Pioneer era.\n\nWith no conventional land battles and few protracted civil disturbances since the British colonisation of Australia, most military re-enactment in Australia focuses on events from other countries (mostly European), including the European Feudal, medieval, and renaissance eras, and American Civil War. The Viking Era is popular. The oldest surviving re-enactment groups in Australia are the Ancient and Medieval Martial Arts Society, originally established in the early 1970s and the New Varangian Guard founded in early 1981. Other early groups that no longer exist were the Melbourne Vikings, founded in the early 1970s, the Medieval Society of Tasmania, founded in the late 70s and the Knights Guild of Wessex and Mercia Inc which was formed in Queensland in 1979–80. While focused more on living history rather than re-enactment, the Society for Creative Anachronism was formed as a local group in Sydney in 1980, before officially joining the US-based group in late 1981.\n\nSeveral groups and individuals reenact the classical period, with an emphasis on Greece and Republican Rome. Groups include, the Sydney Ancients Hoplite and Roman Society, Pax Romana (Qld), and Mare Nostrvm (Qld).\n\nMany groups focus on the Viking, late Roman, and Early Byzantine eras. The New England Medieval Arts Society (NEMAS) Easter Festival focuses on this era, and 25 or so living history groups that specialise in this era attend this event. One of the larger groups, the New Varangian Guard (NVG), with chapters in a number of cities, focuses on both this period and the early medieval period. Other groups include Ironguard Medieval Society located in Central West NSW, the Blue Mountains NSW and Illawarra NSW . One of the older and most established groups Europa at Springwood NSW who focus on the Viking occupation of York. Queensland groups portraying this period include, Staraya Ladoga, Saga Vikings Inc. .\n\nWhile arguably not as authentic, this is a popular area of focus for the Kingdom of Lochac, a subgroup of the Society for Creative Anachronism in Australia.\n\nThe Society for Creative Anachronism was probably the largest group to focus on this period, however in recent years metal-edged groups have become increasingly popular and rival SCA numbers today. Other groups include Company of the Staple, The Knights Order of Lion Rampant (Qld), Company of the Wolf, Condottieri (Qld), the Company of the Phoenix (Qld), Medieval Combat & Culture (MCC). Based in Southern Highlands and Central West NSW, Black Company (NSW), the Enterprise of the Black Garter and Oltramar (Qld).Two multi era groups are The Fyrd Inc (VIC) and Order of the Horse (QLD). Order of the Horse one of the largest multi era historical cavalry groups that covers 12thc 2nd,3rd Crusades Saracen and the 2nd to the 6thc Crusades up to early 13thc, the late 14thc cavalry and joust. The Order of the Horse is the first to create a complete Saracen mounted combat cavalry under Sultan Salah-ad-Din late 12thc Sultan.\n\nWhile less numerous, there are a number of groups that focus on this period. The largest is the Pike and Musket Society (also known as the Routiers) and the New England Colonial Living History Group. There are a number of schools that teach historical fencing techniques from this era, including the Stoccata school of Defence and Prima Spada School of Fence (Qld). Other groups in this period include Das Törichte Leben (Qld), and Historia Germanica (Qld).\n\nA number of groups focus on the activity of early colonial units. Sometimes these groups are based around a particular feature, like an historical fort. Other times, they focus on the history of an actual unit from the area. An example is New England Colonial Living History Group, located in Armidale, NSW There is some interest in American Civil War re-enactment, perhaps as a result of Australia's role in the conflict. Groups in Queensland focusing on this period include: 19th Century Queensland, The Queensland Colonial Association, and the Victoria Barracks Historical Society. Order of the Horse (QLD) also focuses on Napoleonic cavalry specialising in heavy cavalry.Order of the Horse founder of the group was the first to create the French 3eme,4eme Dragoon cavalry, 3e French Cuirassiers and the Brunswick Hussars unit in Australia.\n\nGympie, Queensland is home to the Gympie Historical Re-enactment Association which recreates the days of the Bush Rangers and the gold rush.\n\nMany groups focus on later periods, still within living memory – World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War. While there may be some opposition to groups with such a focus, many individuals have connections to this period through family and friends who served. There are a number of groups who portray this era in Queensland including, Army Group South, Contact Front – Vietnam War Living History Australia, Cobbers in Khaki and Green, and The Standard Bearers.\n\nThe focus on Australian Light Horse is quite large, considering that most participants must provide their own horse. There are many Australian groups that participate in light horse re-enactment. Unusual for Living history groups, the Light Horse groups participate in war memorial services. It was up until only recently that actual veterans from the campaigns still rode in memorial services, and the Light Horse re-enactors often have connections with their local Returned Services League. Groups normally reenact the units that were historically active in their areas. The oldest historical re-enactment group in Australia is \"A Troop – Richmond/Windsor\", started in 1978.\n\nSee full article Historical European Martial Arts in Australia\n\nWhile HEMA is not historical reenactment per se, as largely it focuses on the study of historical combat, while using modern clothing and equipment, there is some crossover activity with the extra study of historical context. Additionally, some HEMA practitioners study armoured combat, and some experiment with the practice of HEMA wearing period style clothing.\n\nA number of smaller feasts, drill practices, weekend events, and tournaments are held throughout the year. These typically focus on the period dealt with by the group. Some historical groups are involved in ceremonial duties and teaching history. The Light Horse living history group and many 20th Century groups have associations with the Returned Services League (RSL) and are usually involved in ANZAC day duties. There has been a re-enactment of the Castle Hill convict rebellion (also known as the Battle of Vinegar Hill) and the Eureka Stockade, two historical battles of significance on Australian soil. The Australian Medieval Conference is a large biennial event focusing on arts, culture, and combat of this period.\n\nThere are several large living history events held regularly:\n\nThis event is hosted every mid-winter by the New England Colonial Living History Group in Wychwood Forest near Armidale, New England New South Wales.\n\nThis event is a large Dark Age biennial Easter Gathering in Armidale in northern New South Wales. This is a combination of re-enactment groups from various parts of the world namely Australia and New Zealand, held every second Easter in The Armidale Pine Forest. It is attended by around 500 people, with numbers growing every year.\n\nThe Society for Creative Anachronism has held the Rowany Festival annually since April 1983, and is the longest running medieval/living history event in Australia. About 1,200 re-enactors usually attend, the largest number of Society members at any one event in Australia. SCA Heavy Combat activities at Rowany Festival have had more than 300 participants.\n\nThe Medieval Conference is a four-day event which has been held every two years since 1983. The first conference was held in the mid-1970s in a back yard, with the second hosted at the Macquarie University playing fields (now the M2 Toll Plaza) in October 1983. Participants sought to recreate the life and times of a number of specific periods of history from the ancient period to around 1650 AD. There were many activities, including lectures and workshops on historical and cultural topics, arts and crafts, feasts, games, and combat. It was an opportunity for all re-enactment groups to showcase what they do and to share their knowledge.\n\nThere was no conference held in 2015, a committee has been formed to hold the 2017 conference at a private property near Goulburn, NSW.\n\nHeld at the Abbey Museum of Art and Archaeology in Caboolture, the Abbey Medieval Festival is a large festival held to generate interest and to educate the public. It includes over 30 medieval re-enactment groups covering the period from 600 to 1600 AD in Europe and the Middle East. It features combat, music, dance, craft, and two large medieval banquets. It is the largest living history event by attendance, attracting over 37,000 spectators in 2012.\n\nHeld annually over the June long weekend at Fort Lytton National Park in Lytton, Queensland, History Alive: A Journey Through Time, is a multi-period re-enactment event with living history groups representing periods from the Roman era to the Vietnam War era. Run by the Queensland Living History Federation, the event aims to showcase re-enactment and Fort Lytton. The event offers visitors a great day out with a historical focus.\n\nHeld annually on the 23rd and 24th of September, the St Ives Medieval Faire hosts the international jousting championships. The faire has been running since 2013. It features reenactors from the dark ages to the 17th century. The Faire hosts many well known re-enactment societies, including the New Varangian Guard (NVG), Europa as well as the Pike and Musket society. \n\n\n"}

Vehicular traffic runs south on this one-way street.\n\nLudlow Street was named after Lieutenant Augustus Ludlow, the naval officer who was second-in-command to Captain James Lawrence on the USS \"Chesapeake\" during the ship’s engagement with HMS \"Shannon\" on June 1, 1813. It was to Ludlow that Lawrence said \"Don't give up the ship.\"\n\nThe land that is now Ludlow Street was once part of the huge De Lancey Estate, which had been confiscated from James De Lancey after the Revolutionary War, due to his status as a Loyalist, and auctioned off. By the early 19th century, speculative builders had constructed decent housing for workers on Ludlow Street, as well as other streets nearby, such as Eldridge, Forsyth and Chrystie Streets. At mid-century, Ludlow was in the middle of \"Kleindeutschland\", where large numbers of German-speaking immigrants had settled, and was one of the informal boundaries of the Jewish section of the neighborhood, along with Grand, Stanton, and Pitt Streets.\n\nAs far back as 1962 \"Theatre of Eternal Music\" members Tony Conrad and Angus MacLise lived and worked at 56 Ludlow and in 1965 Lou Reed, John Cale and Sterling Morrison of The Velvet Underground lived and recorded there. The earliest known recorded version of \"All Tomorrow's Parties\" was recorded there. Other filmmakers, performers, poets, artists and musicians that lived in the building at the time included Warhol superstars Mario Montez and Jack Smith. Tony Conrad has produced two CDs from the Jack Smith tape archives subtitled \"56 Ludlow Street\" that were recorded at 56 Ludlow Street between 1962 and 1964. In the mid-1970s Gary Weis made some short films of Taylor Mead talking to his cat in the kitchen of his Ludlow Street apartment called \"Taylor Mead's Cat\". From 1980 to the mid-80s actor/videomaker Craig Calman lived in the building adjoining Taylor Mead's. An excerpt from Tyler Hubby's film \"Tony Conrad: Completely in the Present\" documents Tony Conrad making a field recording on Ludlow Street.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Ludlow Street was well known as a street where no wave Colab artists connected with ABC No Rio lived; such as Kiki Smith, Fab Five Freddy, Coleen Fitzgibbon, Tom Otterness, Beatrice (Bebe) Smith, Izhar Patkin, Tron Von Hollywood, Wolfgang Staehle, Raina Jane Sherry, Christof Kohlhofer, Carlo McCormick, Cara Perlman, Steven Parrino, Edwige Belmore, Joseph Nechvatal, Uli Rimkus, Peter Fend, Walter Robinson, Aline Mare, Emily XYZ, and George Condo. In 1980, Coleen Fitzgibbon made a video called \"Ludlow\" about Ludlow Street. From 1983 to 1989, the bimonthly cassette publication Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine was based out of 143 Ludlow Street. Leonard Abrams started the East Village Eye cultural magazine at 167 Ludlow Street. In 1989 the Beastie Boys used a photo of the southwest corner of Ludlow and Rivington Street as the cover for their album \"Paul's Boutique\". In the 1980s, the two level loft at 58 Ludlow was the home to artists such as Alex Hahn, Douglas Eisenstark, David Blair and Leslie Mentel, among others. Wolfgang Staehle presented an extended digital photographic record of Ludlow Street in his exhibition at Postmasters Gallery in 2016/2017.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the increasing popularity of the area among hipsters, driven out of the East Village by an invasion of yuppies, led to an upturn in activity along Ludlow Street, with several old establishments, such as corner delis (a.k.a. bodegas) closing shop to make way for bars, music venues such as the Ludlow Street Bar & Grill (a basement restaurant and music venue), and alternative theatres such as (before it became an empty lot), Piano's Theater (before it became a music venue and bar), and Todo Con Nada (before it became The Dark Room).\n\nIn the 2000s, Ludlow Street was a destination street for musicians and music-lovers, and was heavily populated with fashion shops, art galleries, bars, restaurants, and performance venues such as Cake Shop, The Living Room, and Piano's making Ludlow into a small nightlife strip with a distinct subcultural flavor. Local institutions included the bistro/cafe Pink Pony, the adjacent artist bar Max Fish, Katz's Deli (one of the city's most famous delicatessens) Motor City bar, Ludlow Street Guitars, Earthmatters Cafe (hangout of musicians/actors/writers/techies), Ludlow Studio (which was home to some of the top recording artists in the mid-1990s) and the Sombrero Mexican restaurant, better known to a generation of musicians as \"The Hat.\" The art and cultural gallery Ludlow 38 is the downtown satellite for contemporary art of the Goethe-Institut New York. The space was designed by artists Ethan Breckenridge and Liam Gillick. In 2005 artist Wolfgang Staehle created \"One day of life on Ludlow Street (New York)\". The work consists of 6716 images displayed in approximately 8 second intervals over 24 hours.\n\nIn 2013, Ludlow Street between Delancey and Houston Streets lost to rising rent many small interesting shops, bars and cafes that once gave the street its distinctive flavor. Closed were: Pink Pony Cafe Littéraire & Ciné Club, the print shop at 139 Ludlow, Press Tea, Earth Matters natural food store and Motor City bar. However, Banksy installed a major street art installation on Ludlow Street in the fall of 2013 as part of his \"Better Out Than In\" residency: a strange vision of horses with camera-lens googles rearing up by a car covered with cowering humans. The work is Banksy’s largest New York work to date.\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Lithic artefacts and hominin remains have been discovered at the site. The level of sophistication of the Mata Menge lithic artefacts is described as being 'simple'.\n\nIn 1970, Theodor Verhoeven and Johannes Maringer were the first to associate the remains of \"Stegodon florensis\" with stone artefacts, linking these together as evidence of early hominin colonization of Flores, a feat that requires crossing the open sea.\n\nA 1994 excavation yielded 45 lithic elements, consisting mostly of basalt and chert, with several being classified as artefacts. The fossil remains of \"Stegodon florensis\", \"Hooijeromys nusatenggara\", crocodile and freshwater mollusk were also discovered. The 1994 excavation yielded a dating of around 730,000 BP.\n\nThe 2004-2006 excavation yielded the remains of 487 lithic artefacts.\n\nIn October 2014, the fossil remains of an early hominin were discovered at the site. A mandible and six teeth were discovered. The hominin fossils belonged to at least three distinct individuals. The hominin fossils were dated to around 700,000 BP, making the Mata Menge fossils the oldest hominin fossils yet discovered on the island of Flores. The fossils at Mata Menge are likely to belong to hominins that resulted from the effects of insular dwarfism working on \"Homo erectus\".\n\n47 lithic artefacts were discovered in the layer containing the hominin fossils. The remains of \"Stegodon florensis\", \"\", Komodo dragon and crocodile were also discovered in the layer associated with the hominin fossil remains.\n\nHominin fossils at Mata Menge, in particular the mandible, are smaller than those of \"Homo floresiensis\". The size and shape of the teeth of the Mata Menge fossils are similar to those of \"H. floresiensis\", but the Mata Menge fossils are more primitive. The lithic artefacts at Mata Menge also show cultural similarities to those found at Liang Bua. The similarities in lithic artefacts and hominin fossil remains suggest that the hominins at Mata Menge were likely ancestral to \"H. floresiensis\".\n\n"}

Battles have taken place at wide range of locations and events around the country. During the period 1984-1999 it shared many members in common with the Clan's political wing, the better-known McGillicuddy Serious Party.\n\nThe McGillicuddy Highland Army (McGHA) was established in Hamilton, New Zealand, in 1978 as the McGillicuddy Highland Regiment, the battling wing of the Clan McGillicuddy. Its foundation was inspired by a pacifist battle that Clan leader Graeme Cairns, the Laird of Hamilton, had taken part in Dunedin earlier that year involving Alf's Imperial Army (Alf's).\n\nAs required by the rules of pacifist warfare, the McGHA fights its battles using strictly non-harmful weapons, such as newspaper swords and cardboard shields for personal duelling. 'Mass effect' weapons such as water bombs, flour bombs, porridge bombs, funnelators (huge slingshots), and meths mortars armed with soft or rotten fruit are also used (though water and flour bombs are the most common). 'Psychological Weapons' such as the Can-Can charge, heavy duty assault poetry, mass singing and vicious taunting are also permissible.\n\nThe basic uniform of the McGHA regiments was a white shirt, kilt, and bonnet with a white cockade, with a doublet faced in the regiment's colour. How strongly military the uniform looked varied depending upon the individuals in a regiment; whilst there were very strong variations between the regiments themselves. Appearances ranged from 17th century Scottish Jacobites to 19th century Victorian British Scots, to South American Presidential Guard, to hippies or anarchists, with the only article in common being a kilt. One regiment even wore tartan trousers combined with Russian-style jackets and fur hats.\n\nThe Clan McGillicuddy being a Jacobite Clan, its Army naturally fought for the restoration of the Stuarts to the throne of New Zealand and Scotland. A strong rivalry with Alf's Imperial Army soon developed, as the McGHA evolved their own idiosyncratic interpretation of pacifist warfare.\n\nThe regiments developed into the Clan's 'standing army' with uniformed troops ready to swing into battle against the McGillicuddy Serious Party's political opponents, The Cambridge Borough Council, and various 'irregular' pacifist warfare groups such as folkies, nudists, hippies, anarchists, Outward Bound, student clubs and student hostels.\n\nOther uniformed 'regular' opponents, include such groups as Alf's Imperial Army, The Fort Custard Fire Dept, Black Mac's Death's Head Hussars, the Seaweed People, the Knights of the Brown Bottle, the Auckland Revolutionary Army, The Knights of the Order, the Lindskiis, and the NZ Colonial Brigade.\n\nBattles have taken place in towns and cities all around New Zealand, and at public events such as University Orientation weeks and capping events, folk festivals, local carnivals, wine and food festivals, snow festivals, swimming-pool openings, school gala days, and \"Summer City\" programs.\n\nThe 1st Flying Claymores were the first company in the regiment, quickly followed by the 2nd McBormann Fusiliers, both based in Hamilton.\n\nThe name was changed to the McGillicuddy Highland Army in 1985, shortly after the Wellington-based 3rd Laird's Own Borderers (established in March 1984 ) was officially incorporated into the Army, and its members welcomed into the Clan.\n\nThe success of the Clan's political wing, the McGillicuddy Serious Party in the 1987 and 1990 NZ General Elections saw a rapid growth in McGHA membership, with new regiments founded in Auckland (The 5th Thane of Gordonton's Own Islemonn), Christchurch (The 6th Jahkirk Highland Tossers), and Dunedin (The Blues and Greys). At its peak in late 1992, the McGHA consisted of some eight uniformed regiments boasting a combined membership of over 100 pacifist warfarers.\n\nAs of 2009, the Clan McGillicuddy has no 'standing' uniformed regiments, although the Army has never been formally demobbed. Many Clan members still answer the Laird's calls to arms, and the Clan will still happily meet in battle any opponents who wish to challenge them.\nThe most recent battle by Clan McGillicuddy saw McGillicuddy \"Martians\" take on Alf's Imperial Army in Oamaru on January 31, 2007, in an enactment of the \"War of the Worlds\".\n\nLargely taken from issues of the Clan McGillicuddy's magazine Th'Noo in particular issue number 10/11.

To overcome the objection, the government added tourism to the ministry's portfolio. Two agencies manage Thai tourism: The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), is responsible for \"bodycount\", i.e., attracting visitors.

It was used as the metaphoric mother of all Serbs. Serbian national myths and poems constantly invoke Mother Serbia.\n\nThe territories inhabited by ethnic Serbs outside Serbia can be represented as the children of Mother Serbia. Serbia may also be described as a daughter of Mother Serbia, alongside other Serb territories, as in Dragoslav Knežević's poem \"Mother Serbia\": \"One sister younger than the older Montenegro and Serbia, In peacetime and in war Krajina joins the Serbian flock\".\n\nDositej Obradović (1739–1811) extensively used Mother Serbia in his works. The concept and term was used in many patriotic songs, such as \"Vostani Serbije\", \"Oj Srbijo, mila mati\", \"Oj Srbijo mati\", etc.\n\nOn February 24, 1874, the \"Serbian Liberation Committee for the Sanjak of Niš\", known simply as the \"Niš Committee\", was founded by local notables. Orthodox priest Petar Ikonomović swore Oath on the Christian cross and Gospel, reminiscent of the Orašac Assembly (1804).

In the top left corner is the union flag with the colours red and white. The Union flag represents the settlement of New Zealand by mainly British people after New Zealand became a British colony in 1840. The four stars on the flag are red with white outlines. The flag is flown from government buildings and schools and on days of national importance such as ANZAC day.\nThe national colours of the Māori, an indigenous people of Polynesian origin in New Zealand, are black, white and red.\n\nOn 13 March 1975, the Queen's Service Order was created by royal warrant. With the institution of the Queen's Service Order, red ochre was \"given official sanction as a national orders colour\". This colour has spiritual importance to the Māori by whom it is known as \"kōkōwai\".\n\nIn 1989, a competition was run by a group named Te Kawariki to design a national Māori flag. The chosen flag became associated with the tino rangatiratanga or Māori sovereignty movement. It has gradually become a representative flag for Māori across New Zealand, but is still known as the Tino Rangatiratanga Flag. In 2009, the Minister of Māori Affairs stated that a Māori flag should be flown at Auckland Harbour Bridge on Waitangi Day, the National Day of New Zealand. The Tino Rangatiratanga Flag was recognised as the preferred Māori flag by Cabinet on 14 December 2009. On Waitangi Day 2012, it was flown for the first time at the Wellington Town Hall, and the mayor of Wellington said that it should be the \"start of a long-running tradition\".\n\nIn addition to the Queen's Service Order, decorations that include or consist of the national colours are the Order of New Zealand, the New Zealand Order of Merit the New Zealand Operational Service Medal, the New Zealand War Service Medal, and the New Zealand Service Medal 1946–1949.\n\nThe Queen's Service Order and Queen's Service Medal both have a ribbon with \"central alternating stripes of red ochre (kokowhai), white and black in a descending step pattern from left to right\" with a Māori Poutama motif.\n\nThe military decorations New Zealand Operational Service Medal, New Zealand War Service Medal, and New Zealand Service Medal 1946–1949 all have black and white ribbons drawn from the national colours.\n\nIn August 2012, Air New Zealand introduced its new livery, changing its corporate colours from teal to black, changing its typeface, but retaining the iconic Koru symbol. The first plane to be repainted, an ATR 72-600, was painted almost entirely in black. An Airbus A320, to be delivered in June 2013, will be the first plane to feature white body and black tail livery.\n\nThe typeface, designed by Kris Sowersby's foundry Klim Type Foundry, will consist of black lettering on the white body of each plane.\n\nMany of the national sport teams of New Zealand are associated with the colour black. These include the men's rugby union team (\"All Blacks\"), men's cricket team (\"Black Caps\"), men's basketball team (\"Tall Blacks\"), men's softball team (\"Black Sox\"), men's baseball team (\"Diamondblacks\"), men's ice hockey team (\"Ice Blacks\"), men's field hockey team (\"Black Sticks Men\"),women's rugby union team (\"Black Ferns\") and women's field hockey team (\"Black Sticks Women\").\n\nIn 2004, Badminton New Zealand tried to brand itself as \"The Black Cocks\", an association to the sport's shuttlecock, as a gimmick to garner attention and sponsorships. It drew sponsorship interest from condom manufacturers, but the International Badminton Federation objected to the name, which has since been abandoned.\n\nWhite is also used for sport team colours. Because uniform colours in Association football cannot clash with referee uniforms in FIFA tournaments, the men's football team uses white uniforms and is known as the \"All Whites\". The women's softball team is known as the \"White Sox\", and the women's cricket team is known as the \"White Ferns\".\n\nNew Zealand sports teams have occasionally used teal as an accent colour, most notably in cricket. The same colour also has connections with other organisations such as Air New Zealand (see above).\n\nIn motorracing, New Zealand's national colours are green (based on British racing green) and white.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11848016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11848016", "title": "Novel of manners", "text": "Novel of manners\n\nA novel of manners is work of fiction that re-creates a social world, conveying with finely detailed observation the customs, values, and mores of a highly developed and complex society.\n\nThe conventions of the society dominate the story, and characters are differentiated by the degree to which they measure up to the uniform standard, or ideal, of behaviour or fall below it. The range of a novel of manners may be limited, as in the works of Jane Austen, which deal with the domestic affairs of English country gentry families of the 19th century and ignore elemental human passions and larger social and political determinations. It may also be sweeping, as in the novels of Balzac, which mirror the 19th century in all its complexity in stories dealing with Parisian life, provincial life, private life, public life, and military life.\n\nNotable writers of the novel of manners from the end of the 19th century into the 20th include Henry James, Evelyn Waugh, Edith Wharton, and John Marquand.\n\nBooks and notes in this period instructing one how to behave in society are countless. In particular, Lord Chesterfield's letters to his son are a prime example to anyone concerned with propriety. He instructs his son to engage society in a pleasing manner which includes avoiding possibly offensive or controversial subjects, speaking in peaceful tones, and acquiring a poised posture, all in consideration of the company one is in. This obsession with proper social conduct spawned a wave of novels concerned with this sort of behaviour. In 1778, Frances Burney wrote \"Evelina\", a novel whose innovative plot and treatment of contemporary manners made it a landmark in the development of the novel of manners. Social behaviour in public and private settings accounts for much of the plot of \"Evelina\". This is mirrored in other novels that were more highly popularised in the beginning of the 19th century. Jane Austen's novels are perhaps the most recognisable works in the genre. Because of Austen's works, the novel of manners is mostly associated with the early 19th century.\n\nThe rise in the importance of social behaviour had not gone unnoticed by one Horace Walpole, the widely credited inventor of Gothic fiction. Walpole's knowledge of Chesterfield and the importance of manners perhaps influenced not only his work but carried over into other authors' novels dubbed \"Gothic\" as well. Walpole wrote what is generally accepted to be the first Gothic novel during Chesterfield's lifetime, \"The Castle of Otranto\" in 1764. It is theorised that the emergence of the novel of manners as a full genre was in retaliation to the rise in the popularity of the Gothic novel.\n\nThis near-simultaneous emergence of the novel of manners and the Gothic novel led to a crossover of characteristics between the genres. The main link between the novel of manners and the Gothic novel is the language of manners. In both cases, social and moral manners are dominating factors in the structure of the novel. In the Gothic novel, the starkest difference is the supernatural or the indication of supernatural events. However, many of the characters are often so far below the accepted level of social behaviour that it is considered horrific. Another feature that differs from the novel of manners is the outcome of the novel. In Gothic fiction, the outcome is not always the positive reinforcement of morals that the novel of manners offers. An example of this morally anti-climactic ending would be Charlotte Dacre's \"Zofloya\".\n\nAnother theory for the emergence and growth of the novel of manners is that the changes taking place in English society were eroding the class boundaries. Changes in the social hierarchy were taking place due to leaps in technology and the novel of manners was a way to comment upon challenges to the traditional class order. The different classes represented in the novels served to represent how the different classes in society were supposed to behave in different settings. This includes public versus private, rural versus urban, and settings where there were men versus women. This contrast between the genders highlights the fact that there were many more women that were authors of novels of manners than there were men. This brought the focus of many of these novels to the social issues and conventions that plagued women of the time.\n\nNovels of manners in English include:\n\n\nPatricia Meyer Spacks\nYale Guides to English Literature\nU.S.\n2006\n\nLord Chesterfield, Introduction and Notes by David Roberts\nOxford University Press\nGreat Clarendon Street, Oxford\n1992\n\nHorace Walpole\nOxford University Press\nGreat Clarendon Street, Oxford\n1996\n\nCharlotte Dacre\nOxford University Press\nGreat Clarendon Street, Oxford\n1997\n\nFrances Burney\nOxford University Press\nGreat Clarendon Street, Oxford\n2006\n"}

With 82% percent of the population being rural, and about 85% of the population depending on semi-subsistence agriculture, the cuisine is heavily based on agricultural crops, including yams, taro, rice and sago. Fruits such as pineapples, pawpaws, mangoes, passionfruit, and more are also abundantly grown in Papua New Guinea and etc. Though there are little influences from the cuisine of Southeast Asia, a nearby region, Papua New Guinea shares similarities in cuisine with surrounding Oceanian countries, and even the western part of New Guinea.\n\nAlmost every meal consists of rice and another starch, while meat proteins are only occasional. \"Mumu\", one of the national Papua New Guinean dishes named after an oven in which certain foods are made with by the indigenous peoples, consists of pork, sweet potato, rice, and vegetables. This is an example of a traditional dish composed of the two bases, crops (including starch) and meat.\nBreakfast is perceived as the least important meal of the day, but citizens of Papua New Guinea at this time may drink coffee, tea, or Milo, accompanied with a simple and small breakfast that may consist of pastries and fruits, or even fish and rice.\n\nLunch is traditionally the largest meal of the day. It is known to be a big feast at home with the family, which can last for a few hours. Lunch may consist of vegetables, fruits, soups, rice, and other items. Desserts may also follow this meal. Citizens who live in urban areas and have firm work schedules may have a lunch much smaller and quicker.\n\nOther than lunch, dinner is considered the secondary meal of the day, and simply leftovers from lunch will be eaten at dinnertime. Oppositely however, citizens in the urban areas might have a broader and larger dinner at this time.\n\nApart from savory courses, snacks, appetizers, and desserts are also included in a Papua New Guinean's diet. Snacks usually consist of fresh fruit, nuts, and berries, and appetizers can vary from baked sweet potato to sago grubs. A renowned dessert in the country is \"saksak\", a steamed dumpling made of ground sago, bananas, sugar, and wrapped in a banana leaf.\n\nAlong with other islands in the western Pacific, kava is usually made into a drink by mixing the root of the crop with water. It is a popular and non-alcoholic beverage. \"Kulau\" is a traditional drink in the country, which is the liquid contents of a fresh coconut. Coffee is Papua New Guinea's second largest agricultural export, and is majorly grown in the Highlands Region, and this organic beverage is commonly consumed. Apart from non-alcoholic drinks, beer is an alcoholic beverage that is favored among many Papua New Guineans.\n\nSago is a common and essential part of Papua New Guinean cuisine, as the starch ingredient is included in several traditional dishes, such as pancakes and pudding. Sago is in the form of flour usually extracted from the palm tree. \"Kaukau\", the Tok Pisin term for \"sweet potato\", is also a vital and important crop in the country. Other staples in the Papua New Guinean diet include karuka, cassava, breadfruit (\"ulu\"), and coconuts. Coconut cream is a delicacy often found in numerous local dishes of Papua New Guinea.\n\nThough meat proteins are occasionally consumed, fish and other seafood are the main protein in coastal Papua New Guinean villages. A popular fish dish in Papua New Guinea and etc. is \"Raw Fish\", which is raw fish marinated in citrus juice and coconut cream. It is similar to ceviche. Other than seafood, pork is said to be valuable meat in Papua New Guinea, and is eaten in Christmas feasts.\n\nThe cuisine of Papua New Guinea has little to no culinary influences from the neighboring region of Southeast Asia, other than the Indonesian region of Papua and West Papua. Despite noodles being a common staple in Asian continent, noodles are rarely eaten in Papua New Guinea. The greatest culinary influence was when the Spanish arrived in the 1500s, however their diet had an incomplete affect on the Papua New Guineans. Approximately three centuries later, when the German and British arrived, the European diet began playing a true role to the Papua New Guinean's local cuisine. This is the same case for other nearby Oceanian nations, as cuisines are similar and share identical dishes.\n\n"}
{"id": "5789090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5789090", "title": "Parasocial interaction", "text": "Parasocial interaction\n\nParasocial interaction (PSI) is a term coined by Horton and Wohl in 1956 to refer to a kind of psychological relationship experienced by an audience in their mediated encounters with performers in the mass media, particularly on television. Viewers or listeners come to feel and consider media personalities almost as friends. PSI is described as an illusionary experience, such that media audiences interact with personas (e.g., talk show host, celebrities, characters, social media influencers) as if they are engaged in a reciprocal relationship with them. \n\nParasocial interaction was first described from the perspective of media and communication studies. In 1956, Horton and Wohl explored the different interactions between mass media users and media figures and determined the existence of a parasocial relationship, where the user acts as though they are involved in a typical social relationship. However, parasocial interaction has existed before mass media, when citizen would establish a bond with political figures, gods or even spirits. Since then, the term has been adopted by psychologists, in furthering their studies of the social relationships that emerge between consumers of mass media and the figures they see represented there. Initially, Horton and Wohl viewed parasocial interactions as abnormalities resulting from a lack of time spent with others. Perse and Rubin (1989) contested this view, finding that parasocial interactions occurred as a natural byproduct of time spent with media figures.\n\nAlthough originating from a psychological topic, extensive research of PSI has been performed in the area of mass communication with manifold results. Psychologists began to show their interest in the concept in the 1980s, and researchers began to develop the concept extensively within the field of communication science. Many important questions about social psychology were raised concerning the nature of these relationships that are problematic for existing theories in those fields. The concept of parasocial interaction and detailed examination of the behavioral phenomena that it seeks to explain have considerable potential for developing psychological theory.\n\nThe concepts development of PSI and PSR are interpreted and employed in a different ways in various literature. When it is applied in the use-and-gratifications approaches, the two concepts are typically treated interchangeably, with the regard primarily to a special type of \"interpersonal involvement\" with media figures that includes different phenomena such as interaction and identification (Rubin, Perse, & Powell, 1985). In contrast to the U&G approaches, research in other domains such as media psychology and semiotics, argue for a clear distinction between the two terms (Klimmt, Hartmann, & Schramm, 2006). PSI specifically means the one-sided process of media person perception during media exposure; whereas PSR stands for a cross-situational relationship that a viewer or user holds to a media person, which includes specific cognitive and affective components. Schmid & Klimmt (2011) further argue that PSI and PSR are progressive states such that what begins as a PSI has the potential to become a PSR. In sum, the terms, definitions, and models explicating PSI and PSR differ across scientific backgrounds and traditions.\n\nStudying social interaction, and by extension parasocial interaction (PSI), follows a social cognitive approach to defining individual cognitive activity. Accordingly, there are similar psychological processes at work in both parasocial relationships and face-to-face interactions. However, the parasocial relationship does not follow the process of the typical long-term relationship. The media user remains a stranger to the media figure, whereas this \"strangeness\" would gradually evaporate in typical social interaction.\n\nThe research of PSI obtain significant interest after the advent of the uses and gratifications approach to mass communication research in the early 1970s. In a study of early soap opera, McQuail et al. (1972) identified two essential functions of PSI: companionship and personal identity. Rosengren and Windahl (1972) further argued that PSI could be identified in the process of viewers' interacting with media figures, but such interaction did not produce identification. This is an important distinction, because identification has a longer history than PSI. Subsequent research has indicated that PSI is evident when identification is not present (Chory-Assad & Yanen, 2005; de Bruin, Suijkerbujk, & Jansz, 2006). During last several decades, PSI has been documented in the research analyzing the relationship between audience members and television newscasters, TV and radio talk-show hosts, sitcom characters and other TV celebrities or performers (Palmgreen, Wenner, & Rayburn, 1980; Rubin & Perse, 1987, Sood & Rogers, 2000; Park & Lennon, 2004; Spitzberg & Cupach, 2007). Research has also been conducted on how a favorable PSI can be facilitated between celebrities and their followers on social media, specifically through the interactions followers have with the celebrities posts on social media (Kim & Song, 2016). Although different PSI scales have been employed in these studies, PSI was clearly documented with each persona (Hataway, 2008).\n\nNoticing the importance of media in the area of psychological research, Giles (2002) asserted that there is a need for PSI research to move away from the field of mass communication and into the field of psychology. Studies in this area is commonly conducted by focusing a key psychological issue for PSI: concerning the similarity between parasocial relations and ordinary social relations (Turner, 1993; Gleich, 1996; McKenna & Bargh, 2000; Giles, 2002; Jin & Park, 2009). For example, Turner (1993) adopted the idea of homophily (i.e., the tendency for friendships to form between people that are alike in some designated respect) to examine the interpersonal and psychological predictors of parasocial interaction with television performers. The author found that one dimension of homophily (i.e., attitude) was the best predictor of parasocial interaction. Hataway (2008) indicated that although there seems to be prevailing to analyze PSI in the domain of social psychology, a solid connection to psychological theory and developmental theory has been missing. Hataway (2008) further suggested that more psychological research is needed in order to develop parasocial theory. Specific issues cited were \"how parasocial relationships are derived from parasocial interaction and the way those relationships further influence media usage as well as a social construction of reality, and how parasocial interaction is cognitively produced\" (p. 18). He saw that the majority of PSI research has been conducted by mass communication scholars as a weakness and called for psychologists to refer to Giles (2002) for directions of studies.\n\nAnother important consideration for the study of PSI at a psychological level is that there is a form of PSI existing even in interpersonal social situation. People may use fundamentally the same cognitive processes in both interpersonal and mediated communication (Perse & Rubin, 1989). Giles (2002) also suggested that the element of direct interaction occurred in mediated interaction, such as talking to a presenter or celebrity guest, may continue in social interaction, with a cartoon character or a fictional protagonist in the mind. This may finally constitute a new way of interpreting social interaction. A further consideration is application of social cognitive approaches in individual levels. It is traditionally accepted that this approach is inadequate by itself for the study of relationships (Duck, 1994). However, a number of growing literature on the role of imagination in social interaction (Taylor, 1999; Gleason, Sebanc, & Hartup, 2000; Eyal & Cohen, 2006) suggests that some imaginative activity (e.g., imaginary friends) may be an influential factor in the outcome of real social interaction. PSI is nowadays regarded as an extension of normal social cognition, specifically in terms of the use of the imagination. Current PSI literature commonly acknowledge that the psychological processes acting at the individual level parallel those used in ordinary social activity and relationship building.\n\nParasocial interaction is best explored across a lifespan, which explains the growing focus on parasocial interaction in children and adolescents. Studies have found that sex-role stereotyping is common in children's parasocial relationships with media figures, though boys most overwhelmingly chooses male characters, while young girls are less likely to prefer one gender over another. Additionally, sex-role stereotyping is more common in children ages 5–6, but decreases in children age 10-11. Existing literature also intimates that attachments, parasocial or otherwise, established in early childhood, are highly influential on relationships created later in life. Many studies have focused on adolescent girls because they are more likely to form a strong bond with a media figure and be influenced in terms of lifestyle choices.\n\nSocial identity theory says that people become motivated to behave in ways that boost their self-esteem. Having high self-esteem creates the perception that a person is intelligent, likable, and a good person. In regards to sports teams, fans create a connection within their team to attach themselves to a particular victory or championship.\n\nIn 2012, Evan Frederick (University of Southern Indiana), Choong Hoon Lim, Galen Clavio, and Patrick Walsh (Indiana University) conducted a study on perceived parasocial relationships of Twitter users and athletes. \"Analysis of the data revealed a sense of heightened interpersonal closeness based on the interaction style of the athlete. Followers of the social athlete were driven by interpersonal constructs\" (p. 481).\n\nIn 2007, Brett Boyle and Peter Magnusson, from Saint Louis University published a study titled \"Social Identity and Brand Equity Formation: A Comparative Study of Collegiate Sports Fans\". The authors empirically tested fans of a University men's basketball team. According to the study students, alumni, and the general public were all a part of building brand/team equity through means of heightened social identification factors.\n\nThe primary effect is that of learning: consistent with Bandura's (1986) social cognitive theory, much evidence shows that children learn from positive and negative televised role models, and acquire norms and standards for conduct through media outlets such as television and video games. This is supported by a study by Cynthia Hoffner with children aged 7–12, which showed that the gender of children's favorite televised characters was strongly correlated to the gender of the children. Furthermore, the research showed \"wishful identification\" with parasocial relationships, namely, that boys preferred intelligence, while girls preferred attractiveness when picking favorite characters. These alternatives are both enhanced and mitigated by their separation from reality. \nOn one hand, parasocial interactions are particularly appealing to adolescents in the throes of identity formation and increasing autonomy from parents because these relationships provide idealized figures with whom the adolescent can envision total acceptance. The lack of actual contact with these idealized figures can offer positive social interactions without risk of rejection or consequent feelings of unworthiness. One cannot know everything about a media figure or icon, allowing adolescents to attach fantasized attributes onto these figures in order to meet their own specific wants or needs. On the other hand, entities far removed from reality tend to be less influential on children.\n\nA study by Rosaen and Dibble examined correlation between realism of favorite television character and strength of parasocial relationships. Results showed a positive correlation between social realism (how realistic the character is) and strength of parasocial relationships. Results also show age-related differences among children. Older children tended to prefer more realistic characters, while younger children generally had more powerful parasocial relationships with any character. Age, however, did not impact the correlation between social realism and strength of parasocial interaction, which suggests that more real characters are grounds for more powerful parasocial relationships in children of all ages.\n\nThe ability to learn from parasocial relationships is directly correlated to the strength of the relationship, as has been shown in work by Sandra L. Calvert and colleagues. In a study by Lauricella, Gola, and Calvert (2011), eight 21-month-old infants were taught seriation sequencing by one of two characters. One character, Elmo, is iconic in American culture and therefore socially meaningful, and the other, DoDo, although popular with children in Taiwan, is less well known in American media. Children were better able to learn from the socially meaningful character (Elmo) than from the character who was less easily recognized (DoDo). Furthermore, children could become better able to learn from less socially-relevant characters such as DoDo, by developing a parasocial relationship with that character. Accordingly, after children were given DoDo toys to play with, their ability to learn from that character increased. In a later study, this effect was found to be greatest when children showed stronger parasocial relationships: Children's success on the seriation task, and therefore their ability to learn from a less familiar character, was greatest for children who exhibited more emotional nurturing behaviors toward the DoDo toy during play (Gola, Richards, Lauricella, & Calvert, 2013).\n\nPersonalization of a character makes a child more likely to nurture the character, and thus more likely to form a parasocial relationship that would improve learning from videos featuring the character (Calvert, Richards, & Kent, 2014). In place of DoDo and Elmo, Calvert et al. (2014) gave children Scout and Violet dolls. These interactive plush toy dogs can be programmed to say a child's name and have particular favorites (i.e., a favorite food, color, and song). 18-month-old children were given either personalized toys ( matched for gender, programmed to say the child's name, and programmed to have the same favorites as the child) or non-personalized toys (the opposite gender, programmed to call the children \"Pal\" and have random favorites). At the end of the study, children who had received personalized dolls were better able to learn from their characters than were children who had received non-personalized toys. Children also nurtured personalized toys more than non-personalized toys. It seems that perceived similarities increase children's interest and investment in the characters, which motivates the development of parasocial relationships and helps improve later screen-based learning.\n\nIn the past two decades, people have become increasingly interested in the potential negative impacts media has on people's' behavior and cognition. Many researchers have begun to look more closely at how people's relationships with various media outlets affect behavior, self-perception and attachment styles, and specifically in regards to creating parasocial relationships.\n\nFurther research has examined these relationships with regard to body image and self-perception. Interest in this more narrow area of research has increased as body image issues have become more prevalent in today's society.\n\nA study was conducted to examine the relationship between media exposure and adolescents' body image. Specifically, researchers looked at parasocial relationships and the different motivations for self-comparison with a character. This study surveyed 391 7th and 8th grade students and found that media exposure negatively predicted body image. In addition to the direct negative impact, the study indicated that parasocial relationships with favorite characters, motivations to self-compare, and engagement in social comparison with characters amplified the negative effects on kids' body images. Furthermore, the researchers found that making social comparisons with favorite characters distorted actual, or ideal, body image and self-perception. Studies have been done exploring these effects across gender.\n\nA study examined the parasocial relationships between men and superheroes; the study looked at muscular vs. non-muscular superheroes and men who either did or did not develop a one-sided psychological bond with a superhero character. The results from this study indicated a significant impact on body image, particularly when exposed to muscular superhero characters. The research found that men who formed a parasocial relationship with a muscular superhero had poor self-perception and felt negatively about their own bodies after exposure to the muscular character.\n\nFurther studies have looked into parasocial relationships and more specifically at the impacts on violent and aggressive behavior. A study done by Keren Eyal and Alan M. Rubin examined aggressive and violent television characters and the potential negative impacts they may have on viewers. The study was based on social cognitive theory and looked at trait aggression in viewers and identification and parasocial interaction with aggressive characters. The researchers measured trait aggression in each of the participants and compared that to the level of identification with aggressive characters.The study found that more aggressive viewers were more likely to identify with aggressive characters and further develop parasocial relationships with the aggressive characters.\n\nParasocial interaction has been linked to psychological attachment theory and its consequences have seen the same dramatic effects as real Relationship breakup. In considering the relationship between parasocial interaction and attachment styles, Cohen (2004) found that individuals who were more anxious media consumers tended to be more invested in parasocial relationships.\n\nIn parasocial interaction there is no \"normal\" social interaction; it is a very one-sided relation. The knowledgeable side has no direct control over the actions of the side it observes, and it is very difficult for it to contact and influence it.\n\nWhile much research focuses on the formation and maintenance of parasocial relationships, other research has begun to focus on what happens when a parasocial relationship is dissolved. Eyal and Cohen define parasocial breakup as \"a situation where a character with whom a viewer has developed a PSR goes off the air.\" Eyal and Cohen (2006) found that the distress that media consumers experienced after a parasocial breakup was quite similar to that of a social relationship. However, the emotional distress experienced after the parasocial breakup was weaker than that of the real life interpersonal relationship. Lather and Moyer-Guse (2011) also considered the concept of parasocial breakup, but in a more temporary sense. While the study focused on parasocial breakups as a result of the writers' strike from 2007-2008, the researchers found that media consumers still experienced different levels of emotional distress. This study, like previous studies, showed that parasocial relationships operate very similarly to real-life relationships.\n\nThough most literature has focused on parasocial interaction as a television and film phenomenon, new technologies, namely the Internet, have necessitated a closer look at such interactions. The applications of PSI to computer-mediated environments are continuously documented in literature in last decade (Ballantine and Martin 2005; Goldberg and Allen 2008; Labrecque, 2014). Many researchers concluded that, just as parasocial relationships are present in television and radio, they are also present in online environments such as blogs and other social networking sites. Through an exploration of followers on politicians' blogs, Thorson and Rodgers (2006) found that parasocial interacting with the politician influences people's opinions about the politician, and promotes them to vote for the politician. Social media is designed to be a new channel through which parasocial interaction/relationship can be formed. Research has shown that interacting with individuals through blogs and social media such as Twitter can influence the perceptions of those individuals (Thorson & Rodgers, 2006; Frederick, et al., 2012). As Internet users become more active on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, followers often feel more engaged with them, making the parasocial relationships stronger.\n\nIn 1998, John Eighmey, from Iowa State University, and Lola McCord, from the University of Alabama, published a study titled \"Adding Value in the Information Age: Uses and Gratifications of Sites on the World Wide Web.\" In the study, they observed that the presence of parasocial relationships constituted an important determinant of website visitation rates. \"It appears,\" the study states, \"that websites projecting a strong sense of personality may also encourage the development of a kind of parasocial relationship with website visitors.\"\n\nIn 1999, John Hoerner, from the University of Alabama, published a study titled \"Scaling the Web: A Parasocial Interaction Scale for World Wide Web Sites\", in which he proposed a method for measuring the effects of parasocial interaction on the Internet. The study explained that websites may feature \"personae\" that host to the visitors to the sites in order to generate public interest. Personae, in some cases, are nothing more than the online representations of the actual people, often prominent public figures, but sometimes, according to the study, will be the fictional creations of the sites' webmasters. Personae \"take on many of the characteristics of a [real-life] companion, including regular and frequent appearances, a sense of immediacy...and the feeling of a face-to-face meeting.\" Additionally, the study makes the point that, even when no such personae have been created, parasocial relationships might still develop. Webmasters might foster parasocial interactions through a conversational writing style, extensive character development and opportunities for email exchange with the website's persona.\n\nHoerner used the Parasocial Interaction (PSI) scale, developed by Rubin, Perse, and Powell (1985), and modified the scale to more accurately assess parasocial interactions on the Internet. They used the scale to gauge participants' reactions to a number of different websites, and, more generally, to determine whether or not parasocial interaction theory could be linked to Internet use. The study concluded, first, that parasocial interaction is not dependent on the presence of a traditional persona on a website; data showed that websites with described \"strong personae\" did not attract significantly more hits than other websites selected by the study conductors. \"The literal, mediated personality from the newscast or soap opera of the past [around which the original PSI-scale was framed] is gone. The design metaphor, flow of the web experience, and styles of textual and graphic presentations of the information all become elements of a website persona and encourage parasocial interaction by the visitor/user with that persona.\"\n\nThe study also confirmed the accuracy of the \"PSI web scale\" as a way to gauge consumer parasocial interaction with websites.\n\nSocial media is defined as \"Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0 and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content\". While use of social media for personal use is common, the use of social media by celebrities has given them an opportunity to have a larger platform for personal causes or brand promotion by facilitating word-of-mouth. In recent years, companies and brands have taken this opportunity to use celebrities to aide in impacting such key elements of the company-consumer relationship as brand image and brand awareness (Jansen et al. 2009). For example, Katy Perry currently serves as the top most followed individual on Twitter for having over 109 million followers. The more followers one has on Twitter, the greater perceived social influence one has. This is particularly because tweets are broadcast to each and every follower, who may then retweet these posts on their own profiles, which are then rebroadcast to thousands of other Twitter members (Schaefer 2012; Scott 2011). It is no coincidence that to be \"trending\" (i.e., phrases or topics that are tagged at a greater rate than others) on Twitter at any given point in time is equivalent to having one's movie become a box-office hit or one's hit single rank on the Billboard chart; in other words, Twitter can be utilized as a form of social capital (Jin 2013; Li and Bernoff 2011; Putnam 2000).\n\nIn a 2014 journal article Seung-A Annie Jin and Joe Phua discussed how they conducted studies to determine multiple hypothesis based on the number of followers a celebrity had in correlation to the trust that imparted onto a consumer. This study was done in terms of a celebrity endorsing a product and the consumer's likely to purchase the product after seeing the promotion. Consumers perceived the celebrity with a high number of followers as being more physically attractive, trustworthy, and competent. A high number of followers on the celebrity endorser's profile also significantly increased consumers' intention to build an online friendship with the celebrity. The study found that if a celebrity with a higher number of followers was found to be more trustworthy and the consumer exhibited significantly higher postexposure product involvement and buying intention as opposed to those who were exposed to a celebrity with a lower follower count.\n\nSocial media networks inherit at least one key attribute from the Internet, in that they offer open accessibility for all users. Philip Drake and Andy Miah argue that the Internet, and therefore social networks and blogs, downsize the gatekeeping processes that exist in other mass media forms. They further state that this means that online information can spread unfiltered and thus does not rest on strict framework conditions such as those on television or in newspapers. This, however, remains subject to an ongoing debate within research. Through presence on social media platforms, stars and celebrities attempt on the one hand to participate in the production of their image; on the other hand, they must remain present in these media in order to stay on the media’s and consequently on the audience’s agenda. According to Daschmann (2007), the masses of (aspiring) celebrities all have to compete for the public’s (limited) attention. In such a competitive environment a famous person must therefore remain present on all the accessible media channels.\n\nThe audience’s consumption and reception symbolizes the necessary “fuel” to keep the economic enterprise of celebrity going. Outlining the interdependency between celebrity status and the audience, Wippersberg (2007) emphasizes that a celebrity can only become and remain a celebrity if the audience embraces and thus perceives the individual celebrity as a celebrity.\n\nMost celebrities, aware of the rising importance of social media (for their audience), now themselves actively use these networks, by running their own profiles and making raw and real-time information and content available to the social media community and fans. It allows them to promote themselves and their “products” (i.e. music, albums, movies, shows) by directly communicating with their audience. Nowadays a fan can more easily to get “in touch” with celebrities (as fan mails don’t need to be hand-written and sent though regular mail anymore) by way of comments on photos or videos posted by the celebrity themselves. Often, and dependent upon the celebrity and their personal management of their social profiles, the celebrity may respond to a comment of a random fan or follow. The development of parasocial relationships between the audience/fans and celebrities is facilitated. The process also calls into question the one-way nature of parasocial interaction because celebrities, on the outer surface seem to try to get more and more in contact with their audiences. Researchers now raise the question of how social media, i.e., social networks, have modified these parasocial interactions between the celebrities and their audience.\n\nOne direction for future PSI concerns the advancement of methodology. As theories become more defined and complex, experiments seem to be necessary to be employed in testing hypotheses. Because the meanings of perception and emotion take up much of what parasocial interaction/relationship research interest, the cause and effect is hard to be distinguished and potential spuriousness is difficult to be avoided (Oliver & Raney, 2014). For example, whether similarity precedes PSI and whether mediated interaction create a sense of similarity requires experimental validation (Murphy, Frank, Moran, & Patnoe-Woodley, 2011).\n\nCohen (2001) also suggested that different types of relationships are encouraged to be analyzed by different genres, which particularly challenges scholars in examine the mediated relationship in those reality TVs (e.g., Survivor) (Nabi, Stitt, Halford, & Finnerty. 2006). These prototypical reality shows which are built around narratives, displaying a lot of emotions which seem to invite empathy and identification, and also demonstrating the characters' skills as to develop fandom. Ratings and audience responses provide strong evidence that those reality shows create significant mediated relationship, but future inquiries should examine whether this new kind of mediated interaction/relationship evolves or do these interactions/relationships conform to existing patterns (Oliver & Raney, 2014).\n\nThe influence of media in childhood has received little attention from developmental psychologists, even though children have a high degree of exposure to media. While many studies and experiments have explored the nature of parasocial relationships, there are many opportunities for future research. For example, a potential future area of research could be the issue of reruns, where the relationships have outcomes which are already known or well-established. In addition, another area of research could focus on production techniques or televisual approaches. This would include techniques such as chiaroscuro or flat lighting, the strategic placement of close-ups or establishing shots, deductive or inductive shot sequences, hip hop editing, or desaturation. These techniques have long been theorized to have some sort of influence on the formation of parasocial relationships, but their influence has yet to be determined.\n\nThe prevailing use of social media and its impact on mediated relationships also requires further study of PSI (Branch, Wilson, & Agnew, 2013). Different social media platforms provide channels through which celebrities communicate with their followers easily, making parasocial interaction/relationships seem less unidirectional and perhaps more satisfying and intense (Labrecque, 2014). As such, whether social media has made PSI more a part of everyday life needs further exploration. Baek, Bae, and Jang (2013) also mentioned that technological development have been raising questions regarding the role of PSI in our social lives, as media content is available in more places and times. Our mediated friends are never too far away, instead, they actually rest in our pockets and sleep in our beds. Whether this means that we spend more time and effort on cultivating these relationships and will be less dependent on real social relationships, needs further exploration (Labrecque, 2014).\n\nOther concerns include the continuity of media figures representation across various media outlets, and the notion of parasocial interaction as compensation for lack of social outlets. Popstars, for example, may not only appear on television, but on several different television or radio programs, as either a chat guest or a performer; further repeated viewings of these stars would intensify visual aspects of parasocial interaction with that star. Most research has typically characterized media users as a television viewer who is often solitary and in need of social interaction. The different types of user-figure interaction can be addressed by conceptualizing parasocial interaction as an extension of ordinary social interaction. Through close examination of social encounters that are significant for parasocial relationships, we can continue to distinguish between parasocial interaction an isolated activity and longer-term interaction.\n\n\n\n"}

He made his debut in 1839 at the Concert Bonne-Nouvelle; there his \"unique ambition\", according to his biographer \"J.M.\", \"was, in this time of naïveté, to play the Lovers of vaudeville ... \" When, later in that same year, he signed on with the management of the Théâtre des Funambules, where Deburau still held sway, it was as the \"comic\" of the vaudevilles and the lover, Leander, of the pantomimes. But it was Pierrot, according to Deburau's biographer, Tristan Rémy, \"that better suited his fancy\", and, after understudying the master for a half-dozen years, he appeared in the role in 1845, probably in the many revivals of old pantomimes. When Deburau died in 1846, he assumed the white blouse in all the new pieces.\n\nIn the following year, however, Deburau's son, Jean-Charles (\"Charles\", as he preferred [1829–1873]), also made his debut as Pierrot at the same theater, and its manager, Charles-Louis Billion, careless of finding ways to harmonize their disparate talents, ended up fomenting rivalry between them. As a consequence, Legrand left the theater in 1853, finding employment across the street at the Folies-Concertantes, which, after several months, underwent renovation, then was reopened as the Folies-Nouvelles. This would remain Legrand's venue until 1859, and it was here that he won the wide admiration of the public. When the theater changed hands, and its new director proved unsympathetic to pantomime, the years of his itinerancy began: two years in Brazil, then a long stint at the Théâtre Alcazar in Bordeaux (1864–1870); an Egyptian tour in 1870. When he returned to Paris after the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune, it was for an eight-year engagement at the Tertulia, a \"café-spectacle\" that had little of the old luster of the Folies-Nouvelles. The last two years of his professional career (1886–1887) were spent at the Théâtre-Vivienne, which catered primarily to children.\n\nIn his retirement, Legrand published a volume of his pantomimes and gave his support to the Cercle Funambulesque, which was founded in 1888. He appeared as Pierrot in its first program—in a \"Prologue\" with verses by Jacques Normand and music by Auguste Chapuis—and, in its third program, performed in one of his own pieces, \"Bureaucrat Pierrot\". But at seventy-two, he would mainly serve the Cercle as a spectator, as young mimes took over his role.\n\nLegrand's physique seemed, to the admirers of his predecessor, unsuited to pantomime. Charles Deburau complained to the mime Séverin that he was too thick-set, his trunk and arms too short, his face too fat and round for a mime; he lacked elegance and grace. The poet and journalist Théophile Gautier, in a review of \"The Wager\" (1846), performed by Legrand at the Funambules, also missed \"that unusually long musculature in the legs and arms—natural in some [mimes], obtained in others by dint of hard work—which allowed Mazurier and Ravel to execute their astonishing leaps\", and he counseled lessons in \"the difficult art ... of delivering and receiving the kick.\" But Legrand's schooling had been in the roles of the lover Leander, not in those of the acrobatic \"zanni\"; he brought a dramatic (and romantic) sensibility to his Pierrot. And soon Gautier began to value the difference: when Legrand appeared in \"Marquis Pierrot\" (1847), a pantomime by Champfleury, Gautier compared him, in the range and finesse of his acting, to the great comic actor : \"inasmuch as he is humble, piteous, melancholy, greedy, wheedling, stealthy, endearing, hypocritical in the first part of the piece, so is he arrogant, insolent, scornful—a regular Marquis de Moncade—in the second. What unprecedented truthfulness, what depth of observation ... \" It was not the musculature but the mask that was important to Legrand, as Gautier gradually realized: \"How many shades of feeling,\" he wrote of Legrand's performance in \"The Brigands for Laughs\" (1857), \"how many ideas he summoned beneath this thick layer of flour that serves him as mask!\"\n\nDeburau's great successes had come in the \"pantomime-féerie\", featuring frenetic (sometimes violent) action in a fairy-land of transformations, tricks, and triumphs. Legrand's talents lay elsewhere. It was in the subtle, even touching, dramas of his Pierrot that he found his métier, and it was in the \"realistic\" pantomime that he excelled. At the Folies-Nouvelles he came into his maturity, as another review by Gautier suggests; this is of \"Pierrot Dandin\" (1854), written by the mime and Charles Bridault, and the review should be quoted at length:... what absolutely must be seen is Paul Legrand in \"Pierrot Dandin\". We doubt whether Tiercelin, who played cobblers so well that it is said he could have been transferred to the shoemakers, was ever better at drawing on his hand-leather, at manipulating the knife and the awl, at squaring a sole, at nailing a bit of leather over a frame: one would truly think he has done nothing but this all his life. —But where he is superb is in the scene in which, returning home with a dress, a little shawl, and an apple turnover he has brought for his wife, he finds the conjugal nest deserted and, in place of the unfaithful spouse, a letter revealing that Madame Pierrot has left with the seducer Leander. It must indeed be difficult to make people cry when one is wearing a little black skullcap, when one is sporting a face plastered with flour and a ridiculous costume. Well! Paul Legrand expresses his sadness in such a naïve, true, touching, and profoundly heartfelt manner that the puppet disappears, leaving only the man. In the stage-boxes, the giddiest madcaps forgot to run their tongues over their green barley-sugar sticks and smothered their sobs behind their lace handkerchiefs.So devoted was Legrand to this conception of the character—as sensitive and vulnerable, his juddering heart on his sleeve—that, when he was consigned to a pantomime recalling Deburau's stage, he simply turned it into one of his own. The Pierrot of Pol Mercier's \"Bureaucrat Pierrot\" (1856) was conceived as a scamp and a layabout:In the administrative bureau of a railroad, Pierrot is a very lazy, very inaccurate clerk. At the office he spends all his time in distracting his colleagues and playing a thousand little tricks on them. Sometimes he eats this one's lunch; sometimes he drinks that one's little carafe of wine.\nSo reads the pantomime scenario; what follows is Gautier's review of the piece:... the sight of this pantomime has filled our soul with melancholy. What! Pierrot, from whom of old one borrowed a pen—\"to write a word\"—and who loaned it so willingly, having not the least bit of interest in it himself, has been reduced by the misery of the times to making it run from morning to night over musty old documents! ... Pierrot! no longer daring to wear his white blouse and his wide trousers! Pierrot in a black suit! And what a black suit! threadbare, tight, curled at the cuffs with age, its seams blackened with ink: a perfect poem of respectable misery! —When he sits down, what pitiful angles his knees make! How pointed his elbows are! What a black gaze is in that pale and flour-covered face! This is what has become of the joyous Pierrot of the pantomime. Pierrot has a profession; Pierrot is employed. He has been made to realize that a century as serious as our own will not suffer the idle!Gautier's remark about Legrand's black suit says something else about the mime: that he was as comfortable in character costume (Deburau initiated the practice) as he was in the garb of Pierrot. About this Gautier was ambivalent: the \"truthfulness\" of Legrand's acting was unprecedented, but how welcome it was for the spectator still enchanted by the fantasy of Deburau's stage was a valid question: \"By virtue of the verisimilitude of his acting,\" writes Gautier, \"[Legrand] turns the fantastic type into a human character whose white face comes as a surprise. He often even abandons the linen blouse and trousers, retaining only the plaster mask, in order to represent beings that are more real.\" The \"realism\" of Legrand's pantomime marked a dramatic—and, for some, a disturbing—turn in the fortunes of Pierrot.\n\nIn some respects, Pierrot's turn of fortunes was inevitable. The Folies-Nouvelles was not the Funambules, and neither of its administrators, and , was an unlettered Billion. The renovators of the Folies had intended to transport its spectators to an elegant \"little theater at Naples or Venice\", with no stinting on luxuriant details, and its directors prided themselves on their intellectual credentials, as both were contributors to the light art and journalism of the day. The aim was to attract a high-toned and enlightened public, and, to the enlightened of the early 1850s, realism (and its handmaid, satire) was the style in vogue. Even before Legrand had left the Funambules, the pioneering realist Champfleury had dedicated himself to a reform of the pantomime: \"to realize for the mimic art what Diderot had done for the comedy—that is to say, bourgeoise pantomime.\" His \"Marquis Pierrot\" (1847) marked the beginning of the pantomimic revolution, as Gautier understood immediately, noting that its premiere \"dated a new era in the poetics of the Funambules\":\nM. Champfleury gives to the allegorical whiteness of Pierrot a wholly physical cause: it is the flour from the mill [where he works] that is sprinkled over the face of this pale and melancholy personage. One could not find a more plausible means of giving probability to this white phantom ...: it is clear that the era of the Catholic art is closing for the pantomime and the era of the Protestant art beginning. Authority and tradition no longer exist; the doctrine of independent inquiry is about to bear its fruits. Goodbye to the naive formulas, the byzantine barbarities, the impossible complexions: analysis is opening its scalpel and is going to begin its dissections.\nIt was doubtless this invitation to \"independent inquiry\", as well as Gautier's dithyrambic praise of Legrand's performance in the piece, that drew so many artists and writers into collaborative creation with the mime. Among the contributors of pantomimes to Legrand's repertoire later at the Folies-Nouvelles were the poet Fernand Desnoyers, the composer Charles Plantade, the painter Hippolyte Ballue, and several well-known disciples of the new realism, especially in its satirical and caricatural forms—the Comte de Noé, the caricaturist known as Cham; Jean-Pierre Dantan, the sculptor of caricatural statuettes; Gaspard-Félix Tournachon, the photographer and cartoonist known as Nadar; and of course Champfleury himself. Even Gustave Flaubert wrote a pantomime for Legrand, though it was rejected by Huart and Altaroche (apparently on the grounds that it was insufficiently realistic).\n\nLike realism and satire, parody was welcome at the Folies-Nouvelles. In 1858, Donizetti's opera \"Lucrezia Borgia\" was given a drubbing in Legrand and Bridault's \"In Venice, or Dagger, Gallows, and Rat Poison\". Among the members of the cast were Pierrotini (Legrand), \"of noble race but very clumsy\", Caliborgna, \"so named because of a halberd that had been stuck in her eye and forgotten\", and Gros-Bêta, \"villain, with no manners whatsoever\". Legrand was not above poking fun at himself—as he did in \"The Little Cendrillon\" (1857), a tale, as Storey puts it, \"of a white-faced Cinderfella\", or in \"Le Grand Poucet\" (1858), the punning title of which alerted his audience to the ensuing self-mocking fun. As his tenure at the Folies drew to a close, Legrand could even be said to have been teetering on a kind of pantomimic decadence. Storey describes a piece from the last year before he left the theater:In Bridault's \"Les Folies-Nouvelles peintes par elles-mêmes\" [\"The Folies-Nouvelles' Self-Portrait\"] (1858), which announced the theater's reopening after summer renovations of the \"salle\", the concierge of the establishment, one Père Pétrin, invokes the pantomimic muse of its stage. It is she, he remarks, to whom the audience owes its entertainment, she who inspires its authors \"in the simple goal of molding the mind and the heart.\" He cites as examples of such inspiration the maxims that conclude \"Pierrot millionnaire\" [1857] and \"Le Petit Cendrillon\": \"Money does not bring happiness!\" and \"Polished boots make good husbands!\" The muse replies: \"You're caustic, Père Pétrin!\"\n\nBut apparently Legrand drew back from this brink of cynicism, for when Pierrot, incarnated by younger mimes, crossed the barriers that had forestalled him from violations of his own naïveté, Legrand demurred. After enjoying some success with his \"Pierrot, Murderer of his Wife\" (1881), a pantomime in which a disillusioned Pierrot tickles Columbine to death, the young Paul Margueritte interviewed Legrand, now an aging artist whose triumphs at the Folies lay far behind him. Margueritte's reception was not warm. \"The macabre, the terrible,\" he wrote in his memoir \"Le Printemps tourmenté\" (1925), \"Paul Legrand only tolerated it as accidental, quickly borne away by fantasy and dream.\" And it was Legrand's old Pierrot, unstained by crime and disillusionment, that would survive into the twenty-first century.\n\nPierrot enters carrying newspapers and a doll. The newspapers for himself, the doll for his little girl, who is sleeping in the next room. Having checked on her sleep, he doesn't want to disturb it, so plunges into the reading of his newspapers, which, after filling him with horror, end up by putting him to sleep, too. A dream arrives. Pierrot, now a sleepwalker, gets up, seizes the carafe in which his hallucinated gaze sees some excellent Tokay, and drinks bumper after bumper. A little tipsy, he picks up the doll, believing it to be his daughter; he rocks it to put it back to sleep, smooths its little face and hair, and, growing annoyed over his exertions in undressing it for bed, he throws it on the floor.\n\nStupefaction! He thinks he has killed his child. He runs to the toy that still lies inert and, seized by a violent despair, tries to bring it back to life.\n\nIn vain. Pierrot then tries to kill himself too. He hesitates over various means of death, poison, a noose, etc. He stabs himself with a saber; the blade goes in and out his sleeve. Then he gets a gun, unhooks the mirror from the wall, sets it against the carafe, stands in a good position to see himself, his image appearing in the mirror. The shot rings out and Pierrot falls, thinking himself dead. When he comes to, he flees the theater of his crime, boards a boat, is taken with seasickness, shipwrecks in the middle of the most terrifying storm, swims to safety and collapses, exhausted, on a desert island.\n\nAgain he falls asleep. But this time his awakening will be better. The nightmare has disappeared; it lingers only as a light headache that the first smile of his little girl will dissipate when Pierrot, fully recovered to himself, runs to give her the newly found doll.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3615017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3615017", "title": "Persian dance", "text": "Persian dance\n\nPersian dance or Iranian dance (Persian:رقص ایرانی) refers to the dance styles indigenous to Iran. Genres of dance in Iran vary depending on the area, culture, and language of the local people, and can range from sophisticated reconstructions of refined court dances to energetic folk dances. The population of Iran includes many ethnicities, such as Kurds, Azerbaijanis, Turkmen, Jews, Armenian, Georgian peoples, in addition to numerous Iranian tribal groups which can be found within the borders of modern-day Iran. Each group, region, and historical epoch has specific dance styles associated with it. Raghs (also spelled as Raqs) is the Arabic word for dance, and is almost exclusively the word used for dance in Persian, as the Persian word for dance, paykubi, is no longer in common usage. It's also the word in Azerbaijani for dance (\"Reqs\"). The Kurdish word for dance is Halperke, and the Lurs from Lorestan use the word Bākhten (or Bāzee) for dance.\n\nPeople of Iranian plateau have known dance in forms of music, play, drama or religious rituals and have used instruments like mask, costumes of animals or plants, and musical instruments for rhythm, at least since 6th millennium BC. Cultural mixed forms of dance, play and drama have served rituals like celebration, mourning and worship. And the actors have been masters of music, dance, physical acts and manners of expression. Artifacts with pictures of dancers, players or actors were found in many of archaeological prehistoric sites in Iran, like Tepe Sabz, Ja'far Abad, Chogha Mish, Tall-e Jari, Cheshmeh Ali, Ismaeel Abad, Tal-e bakun, Tepe Sialk, Tepe Musian, tepe Yahya, Shahdad, Tepe Gian, Kul Farah, Susa, Kok Tepe, Cemeteries of Luristan, etc.\n\nThe earliest researched dance from historic Iran is a dance worshiping Mithra (as in the Cult of Mithras) in which a bull was sacrificed. This cult later became highly adhered in the Roman Empire. This dance was to promote vigor in life. Ancient Persian dance was significantly researched by Greek historian from Herodotus of Halikarnassos, in his work \"Book IX (Calliope)\", in which he describes the history of Asian empires and Persian wars until 478 BC. Ancient Persia was occupied by foreign powers, first Greeks, then Arabs, and then Mongols and in turn political instability and civil wars occurred. Throughout these changes a slow disappearance of heritage dance traditions occurred.\n\nAfter the fall of Persian Empire, when the country was torn into pieces, Iranian women and young girls were enslaved by the new conquerors, often forced into sexual slavery and required to perform erotic dances for the new rulers. Religious prohibition of dancing in Iran came with the spread of Islam, but it was spurred by historical events. Religious prohibition to dancing waxed and waned over the years, but after the Iranian Revolution in 1979 dancing was no longer allowed due to its frequent mixing of the sexes. The Islamic Revolution of 1979, was the end of a successful era for dancing and the art of ballet in Iran. The Iranian national ballet company was dissolved and its members emigrated to different countries. According to the principles of the “cultural revolution” in Iran, dancing was considered to be perverse, a great sin, immoral and corrupting. As a result, many of the talented Persian dancers moved to the West and spread out mainly in Europe and the United States and new generation of Iranian dancers and ballet artists have grown up in the Diaspora.\n\nIran possesses four categories of dance and these genres are; chain or line dances, solo improvisational dance, war or combat dances and ritual or spiritual dances.\n\nChain or Line dances are often named for the region or the ethnic groups with which they are associated.\n\nSolo dance includes usually reconstructions of Safavid and Qajar Court Dance. These often are improvisational dances and utilize delicate, graceful movements of the hands and arms, such as wrist circles.\n\nWar or Combat dances imitate combat, or help train the warrior. It could be argued that men from the zurkhaneh (a traditional Persian style gymnasium) called the “House of Strength” and their ritualized, wrestling-training movements are known as a type of dance called Raghs-e-Pa but could also been seen as a martial art.\n\nRitual or spiritual dances, are often Sufi are known as sama and also a type of zikr (religious chant). There are various types of dancing in a trance for healing practices in Iran and surrounding areas. One healing ritual that involves trance, music, and movement is called le’b guati of the Baluchis of Eastern Iran, which is performed to rid a possessed person of the possessing spirit and appears to be in a similar state as an exorcism. There is a term in Balochi \"gowati\" for psychologically ill patients (possessed by wind) who have recovered through music healing, music as medicine. The southern coastal regions of Iran such as Qeshm Island have a similar possession by wind ceremony and it is thought that it may be influenced or originated in Africa, particularly the Abyssinian or Ethiopian region.\n\nThe word sama\",\" from the Arabic root meaning “to listen,” refers to the spiritual practice of listening to music and achieving unity with the Divine, it is spelled sema in Turkish. Dancing mystics (regardless of their specific religious identifications) are called Dervish.\n\nContemporary social dances and urban dance performed at festive occasions like weddings and Noruz celebrations focus less on communal line or circle dances and more on solo improvisational forms, with each dancer interpreting the music in her own special way but within a specific range of dance vocabulary sometimes blending other dance styles or elements.\n\nThis is a list of some of the ancient and contemporary Persian dances, from various ethnic groups within Iran. \n\nThis list of contemporary and historical Persian dancers or choreographers (in alphabetical order, of various dance styles) includes:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It’s a sanctimonious cliché, a statement that is not only old and overused but often moralistic and imperious. ... [P]latitudes have an aphoristic quality, they seem like timeless moral lessons. They therefore shape our view of the world, and can lull us into accepting things that are actually false and foolish.\nPlatitudes often take the form of tautologies, e.g., \"it is what it is\", making them appear vacuously true. But the phrase is used to mean \"there is no way of changing it\", which is no longer a tautology: \"Structuring the sentiment as a tautology allows it to appear inescapable.\"\n\nAt the same time, some phrases that have become platitudes may provide useful moral guidance, such as \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\". Others, though widely trivialized, may be thought-provoking, such as \"Be the change you wish to see in the world\".\n\n\nIn philosophy, platitudes are beliefs or assertions about a topic that are generally accepted as common sense. In some approaches to conceptual analysis, they are taken as a starting point. Conjoining the platitudes on a topic may give a Ramsey sentence. Analyzing platitudes is part of the Canberra Plan of philosophical methodology.\n\nThe word is a borrowing from the French compound \"platitude\", from \"plat\" 'flat' + \"-(i)tude\" '-ness', thus 'flatness'. The figurative sense is first attested in French in 1694 in the meaning 'the quality of banality' and in 1740 in the meaning 'a commonplace remark'. It is first attested in English in 1762.\n\n"}
{"id": "1306405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1306405", "title": "Postfeminism", "text": "Postfeminism\n\nThe term postfeminism (alternatively rendered as post-feminism) is used to describe reactions against contradictions and absences in feminism, especially second-wave feminism and third-wave feminism. The term \"postfeminism\" is sometimes confused with subsequent feminisms such as 4th wave-feminism, and \"women of color feminism\" (e.g. hooks, 1996; Spivak, 1999).\n\nThe ideology of postfeminism is recognized by its contrast with prevailing or preceding feminism. Postfeminism strives towards the next stage in gender-related progress, and as such is often conceived as in favor of a society that is no longer defined by gender binary and gender roles. A postfeminist is a person who believes in, promotes, or embodies any of various ideologies springing from the feminism of the 1970s, whether supportive of or antagonistic towards classical feminism.\n\nPostfeminism can be considered a critical way of understanding the changed relations between feminism, popular culture and femininity. Postfeminism may also present a critique of second-wave feminism or third-wave feminism by questioning their binary thinking and essentialism, their vision of sexuality, and their perception of relationships between femininity and feminism. It may also complicate or even deny entirely the notion that absolute gender equality is necessary, desirable or realistically achievable.\n\nSecond-wave feminism is often critiqued for being too \"white\", too \"straight\", and too \"liberal\", thus resulting in the needs of women from marginalized groups and cultures being ignored. However, since intersectionality is a product of third-wave feminism, the references to such as postfeminist are open to challenge and may be more properly considered feminist.\n\nWhile \"postfeminism\" was first used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, it is now used as a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas. It may also be used to invoke the view that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.\n\nOver the years, the meaning of postfeminism has broadened in scope, encompassing many different meanings, as is the case with feminism. Within feminist literature, definitions tend to fall into two main categories: 1) “death of feminism”, “anti-feminism”, “feminism is irrelevant now” and 2) the next stage in feminism, or feminism that intersects with other “post-” philosophies/theories, such as postmodernism, post-structuralism and postcolonialism.\n\nIn 1919, a journal was launched in which \"female literary radicals\" stated \"'we're interested in people now—not in men and women'\", that \"moral, social, economic, and political standards 'should not have anything to do with sex'\", that it would \"be 'pro-woman without being anti-man'\", and that \"their stance [is called] 'post-feminist'\".\n\nThe term was used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism. Postfeminism is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas. Other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society. Amelia Jones has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and were overly generalizing in their criticism.\n\nThe 1990s saw the popularization of this term, in both the academic world as well as the media world. It was seen as a term of both commendation and scorn. Toril Moi, a professor at Duke University, originally coined the term in 1985 in Sexual/Textual politics to advocate a feminism that would deconstruct the binary between equality based on \"liberal\" feminism and difference-based or \"radical\" feminism. There is confusion surrounding the intended meaning of \"post\" in the context of \"postfeminism\". This confusion has plagued the very meaning of \"postfeminism\" since the 1990s. While the term has seemed on the one hand to announce the end of feminism, on the other hand it has itself become a site of feminist politics.\n\nCurrently, feminist history is characterized by the struggle to find out the present situation—often articulated as a concern about whether there is still such a thing called \"feminism\"—by writing in the past. It is here that the meaning of \"post\" as a historical break is troubling, for \"post\" offers to situate feminism in history by proclaiming the end of this history. It then confirms feminist history as a thing of the past. However, some claim that it is impossible that feminism could be aligned with \"post\" when it is unthinkable, as it would be the same as calling the current world a post racist, post-classist, and post-sexist society.\n\nThe early part of the 1980s was when the media began labeling teenage women and women in their twenties the \"postfeminist generation\". After twenty years, the term postfeminist is still used to refer to young women, \"who are thought to benefit from the women's movement through expanded access to employment and education and new family arrangements but at the same time do not push for further political change\", Pamela Aronson, Professor of Sociology, asserts. Postfeminism is a highly debated topic since it implies that feminism is \"dead\" and \"because the equality it assumes is largely a myth\".\n\nAccording to Prof. D. Diane Davis, postfeminism is just a continuation of what first- and second-wave feminisms want.\n\nResearch conducted at Kent State University narrowed postfeminism to four main claims: support for feminism declined; women began hating feminism and feminists; society had already attained social equality, thus making feminism outdated; and the label \"feminist\" was disliked due to negative stigma.\n\nIn her 1994 book \"Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women\", Christina Hoff Sommers considers much of modern academic feminist theory and the feminist movement to be gynocentric. She labels this \"gender feminism\" and proposes \"equity feminism\"—an ideology that aims for full civil and legal equality. She argues that while the feminists she designates as gender feminists advocate preferential treatment and portray women as victims, equity feminism provides a viable alternative form of feminism. These descriptions and her other work have caused Hoff Sommers to be described as an antifeminist by some other feminists.\n\nSome contemporary feminists, such as Katha Pollitt or Nadine Strossen, consider feminism to hold simply that \"women are people.\" Views that separate the sexes rather than unite them are considered by these writers to be \"sexist\" rather than \"feminist\".\n\nAmelia Jones has authored post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s/1990s and portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and criticized it using generalizations.\n\nOne of the earliest modern uses of the term was in Susan Bolotin's 1982 article \"Voices of the Post-Feminist Generation\", published in \"New York Times Magazine\". This article was based on a number of interviews with women who largely agreed with the goals of feminism, but did not identify as feminists.\n\nSusan Faludi, in her 1991 book \"\", argued that a backlash against second wave feminism in the 1980s had successfully re-defined feminism through its terms. She argued that it constructed the women's liberation movement as the source of many of the problems alleged to be plaguing women in the late 1980s. She also argued that many of these problems were illusory, constructed by the media without reliable evidence. According to her, this type of backlash is a historical trend, recurring when it appeared that women had made substantial gains in their efforts to obtain equal rights.\n\nAngela McRobbie argued that adding the prefix \"post-\" to \"feminism\" undermined the strides that feminism made in achieving equality for everyone, including women. In McRobbie's opinion, postfeminism gave the impression that equality has been achieved and feminists could now focus on something else entirely. McRobbie believed that postfeminism was most clearly seen on so-called feminist media products, such as \"Bridget Jones's Diary, Sex and the City\", and \"Ally McBeal\". Female characters like Bridget Jones and Carrie Bradshaw claimed to be liberated and clearly enjoy their sexuality, but what they were constantly searching for was the one man who would make everything worthwhile.\n\nRepresentations of post feminism can be found in pop culture. Postfeminism has been seen in media as a form of feminism that accepts popular culture instead of rejecting it, as was typical with second wave feminists. Many popular shows from the 90s and early 2000s are considered to be postfeminist works because they tend to focus on women who are empowered by popular cultural representations of other women. Because of this, postfeminists claimed that such media was more accessible and inclusive than past representations of women in the media; however, some feminists believe that postfeminist works focus too much on white, middle-class women. Such shows and movies include \"The Devil Wears Prada, , The Princess Diaries,\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\" Another example is \"Sex and the City\". Carrie Bradshaw from \"Sex and the City\" is an example of a character living a post feminist life. While her character attempts to live a sexually liberated lifestyle, Bradshaw is stuck endlessly pursuing the love and validation of a man. The balance between Bradshaw's independent life as a successful columnist and desire to find a husband exemplifies the tension of post feminism. Many of these works also involve women monitoring their appearance as a form of self-management, be it in the form of dieting, exercise, or—most popularly—makeover scenes. Postfeminist literature—also known as chicklit—has been criticized by feminists for similar themes and notions. However, the genre is also praised for being confident, witty, and complicated, bringing in feminist themes, revolving around women, and reinventing standards of fiction. Examples can also be found in \"Pretty Little Liars\". The novels explore the complexity of girlhood in a society that assumes gender equality, which is in line with postfeminism. The constant surveillance and self policing of the series' protagonists depicts the performance of heterosexuality, hyperfemininity, and critical gaze forced upon girls. The materialism and performance from the girls in \"Pretty Little Liars\" critiques the notion that society has full gender equality, and thus offers a critique of postfeminism.\n\nIn an article on print jewelry advertisements in Singapore, Michelle Lazar analyses how the construction of 'postfeminist' femininity has given rise to a neo-liberal hybrid \"pronounced sense of self or 'I-dentity'\". She states that the increasing number of female wage earners has led to advertisers updating their image of women but that \"through this hybrid postfeminist I-dentity, advertisers have found a way to reinstall a new normativity that coexists with the status quo\". Postfeminist ads and fashion have been criticized for using femininity as a commodity veiled as liberation.\n\n\n"}

Most countries have their school leaving age set the same as their minimum full-time employment age, thus allowing smooth transition from education into employment, whilst a few have it set just below the age at which a person is allowed to be employed.\n\nIn contrast, there are numerous countries that have several years between their school leaving age and their legal minimum employment age, thus in some cases preventing any such transition for several years. Countries which have their employment age set below the school leaving age of 5 years old but (mostly developing countries), risk giving children the opportunity to leave their education early to earn money for their families.\n\nSome countries have different leaving or employment ages, but in certain countries like China and Japan, the average age at which people graduate is 15, depending upon part-time or full-time learning or employment.

The X-Men character Mystique is depicted as bisexual in the comic books, but in the films, she is shown as straight. In the Marvel comic books, Okoye and Ayo are lesbians, but in the popular 2018 film \"Black Panther\", Marvel removed this lesbian relationship. \n\nThe 2015 film \"Stonewall\" was accused of straightwashing and of the related practice of \"ciswashing\" for not including a representation of the two black trans activists who launched the Stonewall riots. The movie \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", about the life of Freddie Mercury, has been accused of straightwashing the sexuality of Mercury, as it depicts him interacting sexually with two women with only a single representation of him with a man. The NBC TV drama \"Rise\" has been criticized for changing the basis of the production, a \"real-life gay drama teacher\" in a working class town, into a straight man; \"Out\" magazine calls it \"cultural theft and [gay] erasure\" that \"should have been the story of a complicated LGBTQ hero\".\n\nIn Stuart Richard's article \"The Imitation Game and the 'straightwashing' of film\", about the film \"The Imitation Game\", Richards states that \nWW II code breaker \"Alan Turing's [gay] sexuality is downplayed and used as a plot device\", to show him as a \"tragic hero and an eccentric, secretive man\"; to make the film \" 'safe' for a potentially conservative audience\", the film only depicts him romantically with Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley).\n\nDragos Manea distinguishes between changing an LGBT character in fiction into a straight character; toning down the LGBT aspects of a character to make the character more acceptable to a heterosexual audience; removing LGBT referents from marketing posters or DVD covers; and changing the depiction of entire LGBT cultures or societies into a heterosexual version.\n\nThe video game Undertale has \"been straight-washed by many writers and fans\", leading to the \"erasure of the queerness found in Undertale and a recasting of the game as one that jibes with the interests of heterosexual male gamers\". Edmond Chang, an assistant professor of women’s and gender studies at the University of Oregon, gave a speech at the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2016 entitled “Brown Skins, White Avatars: Racebending and Straightwashing in Digital Games”. Chang states that video games such as Assassin’s Creed and World of Warcraft \"manipulate race and sexuality, reinforce stereotypes and sometimes lack diversity\".\n\nAfter the mass shooting of gay men at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, a gay club, some commentators did not refer to the LGBT victims, with the Republican National Committee denouncing \"violence against any group of people simply for their lifestyle or orientation\" and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell not mentioning LGBT people in his statement. Activist John Becker stated that media are \"straightwashing\" the attack by \"downplaying or even omitting the fact that the shooting was a crime of hatred against the LGBT community\".\n\nDuring the 2018 Winter Olympics' Opening Ceremony, the television network NBC did not \"mention or highlight a single out LGBTQ athlete in its three hours of Opening Ceremony coverage\"; the network did not acknowledge the only \"publicly out American woman at the Games\" or the first four \"openly gay [men] at the Olympic Games\"\n\nA promotional video campaign created by the Provincetown Chamber of Commmerce shows the town's busy nightlife and artists, but the advertisement makes no mention of the town's active LGBT community, in what some LGBT activists call an example of straightwashing.\n\nIn the Philadelphia's gay neighbourhoods, gay bars such as Woody's and are facing “straight gentrification”, becoming, in effect, \"gay-themed straight bar[s]” where straight men and women predominate, a trend triggered by the desire of straight women for spaces where they will not be harassed by straight men, the rise of gay dating apps such as Grindr (which reduce the need for going to gay clubs), rising rents and gentrification, and increasing mainstream acceptance of LGB people and their spaces. Bob Skiba states that the \"pattern is that gays move into a seedy area, make it their own and transform it. It then becomes desirable to straights who see it as both exotic and safe.” A LGBTI club in Sydney was accused of straight-washing the venue by removing the rainbow flags prior to a visit from the Prime Minister, who is a Pentecostal Christian who previously voted against same-sex marriage in the Australian legislature. While local artists and LGBTI community members have called for a boycott of the business, the venue denies the accusations. \n\nLotte Jeffs has criticized the \"straight-washing\" of the London (UK) LGBT Pride event, stating that rather than focus on recognizing the rights of queer, trans and non-heterosexual people, it has switched to making the LGBT event \"palatable for the masses\" and for heterosexual people who will attend. She says that while big companies sponsor activities and include rainbow-themes in their publicity materials, they hire straight celebrities to endorse products and brands for the event, with few \"dar[ing] to use the words “gay”, “lesbian”, “trans” or “bi” when they show their support for Pride\".\n\nIn the US, from 1930 to 1968, the Motion Picture Production Code caused major studios to eliminate gay characters or references from movies. The 1995 documentary \"The Celluloid Closet\" shows how some screenwriters and directors tried to subtly introduce gay characters, roles or themes, without it being noticed, such as with Gore Vidal adding in a gay relationship in \"Ben-Hur\".\n\nHistorical accounts of lesbian suffragettes Eva Gore-Booth and Esther Roper in some cases straightwash their sexuality, with the historian Gifford Lewis claiming they were not lesbian or queer in his biographies of them.\n\nStraightwashing differs from \"pinkface\", the use of straight actors to play LGB roles or characters. Anna King of \"Time Out\" likens \"pinkface\" to blackface. The LGB community raised concerns about the film \"Brüno\", in which the straight actor Sacha Baron Cohen plays the role of a gay man to \"...mak[e] fun of the queer community\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22286701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22286701", "title": "The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings", "text": "The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings\n\nThe Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings (1951) is a reconstruction of the chronology of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah by Edwin R. Thiele. The book was originally his doctoral dissertation and is widely regarded as the definitive work on the chronology of Hebrew Kings. The book is considered the classic and comprehensive work in reckoning the accession of kings, calendars, and co-regencies, based on biblical and extra-biblical sources.\n\nThe chronology of the kings of Israel and Judah rests primarily on a series of reign lengths and cross references within the books of Kings and Chronicles, in which the accession of each king is dated in terms of the reign of his contemporary in either the southern Kingdom of Judah or the northern Kingdom of Israel, and fitting them into the chronology of other ancient civilizations.\n\nHowever, some of the biblical cross references did not seem to match, so that a reign which is said to have lasted for 20 years results in a cross reference that would give a result of either 19 or 21 years. Thiele noticed that the cross references given during the long reign of King Asa of Judah had a cumulative error of 1 year for each succeeding reign of the kings of Israel: the first cross-reference resulted in an error of 1 year, the second gave an error of 2 years, the third of 3 years and so on. He explained this pattern as a result of two different methods of reckoning regnal years: the \"accession year\" method in one and the \"non-accession year\" method in the other. Under the accession year method, if a king died in the middle of a year, the period to the end of that year would be called the \"accession year\" of the new king, whose Year 1 would begin at the new year. Under the non-accession year method the period to the end of the year would be Year 1 of the new king and Year 2 would begin at the start of the new year. Israel appears to have used the non-accession method, while Judah used the accession method until Athaliah seized power in Judah, when Israel's non-accession method appears to have been adopted in Judah.\n\nIn addition, Thiele also concluded that Israel counted years starting in the spring month of Nisan, while Judah counted years starting in the autumn month of Tishri. The cumulative impact of differing new years and different methods of calculating reigns explained, to Thiele, most of the apparent inconsistencies in the cross references.\n\nUnknown to Thiele when he first published his findings, these same conclusions that the northern kingdom used non-accession years and a spring New Year while the southern kingdom used accession years and a fall New Year had been discovered by Valerius Coucke of Belgium some years previously, a fact which Thiele acknowledges in his \"Mysterious Numbers\".\n\nBased on his conclusions, Thiele showed that the 14 years between Ahab and Jehu were really 12 years. This enabled him to date their reigns precisely, for Ahab is mentioned in the Kurk Stele which records the Assyrian advance into Syria/Israel at the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC, and Jehu is mentioned on the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III paying tribute in 841 BC. As these two events are dated by Assyrian chronology as being 12 years apart, Ahab must have fought the Assyrians in his last year and Jehu paid tribute in his first year.\n\nThiele was able to reconcile the Biblical chronological data from the books of Kings and Chronicles with the exception of synchronisms between Hoshea of Israel and Hezekiah of Judah towards the end of the kingdom of Israel and reluctantly concluded that at that point the ancient authors had made a mistake. Oddly, it is at that precise point that he himself makes a mistake, by failing to realize that Hezekiah had a coregency with his father Ahaz, which explains the Hoshea/Hezekiah synchronisms. This correction has been supplied by subsequent writers who built on Thiele’s work, including Thiele’s colleague Siegfried Horn, TC Mitchell and Kenneth Kitchen, and Leslie McFall.\n\nThiele's method in arriving at his chronology has been contrasted with the analytical method employed by Julius Wellhausen and other scholars who follow some form of the documentary hypothesis. Wellhausen taught that the chronological data of the books of Kings and Chronicles were artificially put together at a date much later than the events they were ostensibly describing and were basically not historical. This was a necessary consequence of his \"a priori\" assumption that the biblical books as we have them today were the work of late-date editors who could not possibly have known the correct history of the times they were writing about. Theodore Robinson summarized this position as follows: \"Wellhausen is surely right in believing that the synchronisms in Kings are worthless, being merely a late compilation from the actual figures given.\"\n\nWellhausen's methodology in interpreting the Scriptures and the history of Israel has therefore been classed by RK Harrison as a deductive approach; that is, one that starts with presuppositions and derives a historical reconstruction from those presuppositions. A necessary consequence of this approach has been that no general agreement has been reached on the chronology of the Hebrew kingdom period as calculated by authors who adopted this method. \"The disadvantage of the deductive approach is that nothing is settled for certain; the results obtained are as diverse as the presuppositions of the scholars, since diverse presuppositions produce diverse results.\" In contrast, Thiele's method of determining the chronology of the Hebrew kings was based on induction, that is, making it a matter of first priority to determine the actual methods used by ancient scribes and court recorders in recording the years of kings, as described above. Thiele's inductive method, then, was based on inscriptional evidence from the ancient Near East, and not on the presuppositions followed by liberal scholarship. It is Thiele's method that has produced the determinative studies for the chronology of the kingdom period, not the presupposition-based method, so that even those interpreters who continue in late-date theories for the authorship of Scripture have recognized the credibility of Thiele's scholarship in determining the date for the division of the kingdom after the death of Solomon, as cited above. The work of Thiele and other textual scholars who have followed an inductive (evidence-based) approach is therefore significant in providing an alternative to the methods of the documentary hypothesis, and the success of that approach has been seen as theologically significant in supporting a high view of the inspiration of Scripture, particularly regarding its integrity in the abundant and complex historical data related to the kingdom period.\n\nIf the chronological data of the MT [ Masoretic text ] were not authentic—the actual dates and synchronisms for these various kings—then neither Thiele nor McFall nor anyone else could have constructed a chronology from them that in every case is faithful to the original texts and in every proven instance is consistent with Assyrian and Babylonian chronology. This mathematical demonstration should sit in judgment over the various theories of text formation: If a theory of text formation cannot explain how the chronological data of the MT has produced a chronology that in every respect seems authentic for the four centuries of the monarchic period, then that theory must be rejected as another example of a presupposition-based approach that cannot meet the rational criteria for credibility.\n\nThiele's chronological reconstruction has not been accepted by all scholars, nor has any other scholar’s work in this field. Yet the work of Thiele and those who followed in his steps has achieved acceptance across a wider spectrum than that of any comparable chronology, so that Assyriologist DJ Wiseman wrote “The chronology most widely accepted today is one based on the meticulous study by Thiele,” and, more recently, Leslie McFall: “Thiele’s chronology is fast becoming the consensus view among Old Testament scholars, if it has not already reached that point.” Although criticism has been leveled at numerous specific points in his chronology, his work has won considerable praise even from those who disagree with his final conclusions. Nevertheless, even scholars sharing Thiele's religious convictions have maintained that there are weaknesses in his argument such as unfounded assumptions and assumed circular reasoning.\n\nThis citation, from a critic of Thiele's system, demonstrates the difference mentioned above between the deductive approach based on presuppositions and an inductive approach based on data, not a priori assumptions. Thiele is criticized here for basing his theories on data or evidence, not on presuppositions.\n\nDespite these criticisms Thiele's methodological treatment remains the typical starting point of scholarly treatments of the subject, and his work is considered to have established the date of the division of the Israelite kingdom. This has found independent support in the work of J. Liver, Frank M. Cross, and others studying the chronology of the kings of Tyre. Thiele's work has found widespread recognition and use across various related scholarly disciplines. His date of 931 BCE, in conjunction with the synchronism between Rehoboam and Pharaoh Shishak in 1 Kings 14:25, is used by Egyptologists to give absolute dates to Egypt’s 22nd Dynasty, and his work has also been used by scholars in other disciplines to establish Assyrian and Babylonian dates. Criticism of Thiele's reconstruction led to further research which has refined or even departed from his synthesis. Notable studies of this type include work by Tadmor and McFall.\n\nScholarly attitudes towards the Biblical record of the Israelite monarchies from the late nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century were largely disparaging, treating the records as essentially fictional and dismissing the value of the regnal synchronisms. In contrast, modern scholarly attitudes to the monarchical chronology and synchronisms in 1 and 2 Kings has been far more positive subsequent to the work of Thiele and those who have developed his thesis further, a change in attitude to which recent archaeology has contributed.\n\n"}

It was originally published by Image Comics in 2002.\n\nA parody of mainstream superhero comics, it details the brief career of a prostitute given superhuman powers by the Viewer. She reluctantly joins the League of Honor which is a parody of the Justice League, composed of the Saint, the Knight & the Squire, the Lady, the Lime, and Speedo who are a parody of Superman, Batman & Robin, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and the Flash respectively.\n\nTogether they fight an array of lackluster villains such as The Noun and The Adverb, until her coarse language and actions, violence, bloody retributions, and her fellating The Saint result in her being expelled from the League. She rejoins them to fight a terrorist attack, flying into space holding a nuclear bomb and facing death (more in an effort to save the life of her young child than anyone else in the vicinity).\n\nLater editions feature an additional eight-page story entitled \"The Pro Vs. The Ho\" in which the Pro squares off with a 12-armed prostitute. In the story, the Ho receives powers in much the same way that the Pro does via the alien \"Viewer\" that orbits the Earth in a cloaked ship. Because the Pro has superpowers, she is able to perform sex acts using superspeed. The problem arises when several of the Johns complain that by the time they relax enough to enjoy themselves, their \"job\" is over. The Ho then appears and confronts the Pro, who knocks her into the river and eventually saves her from drowning. Subsequently the two women get to know one another.

Similarly, Geek in the City's Aaron Duran, who placed \"The Pro\" at #4 on a list of the best graphic novels of the 2000s, labelled the book \"One of the most vile, disgusting, perverse, and gut-numbingly hilarious comics of all time\". \"The Pro\" ranked at #14 in the Comic Book Resources list The Greatest Garth Ennis Stories Ever Told!, where it was described as \"off-kilter\" and \"hilarious\".\n\nUpon receiving a press release for the book, writer and artist Jim Steranko lambasted it as \"psychotic, nihilistic garbage\" produced by evil cultural terrorists, which prompted its creative team into inserting the sarcastic dedication \"For Steranko\".\n\n"}
{"id": "31064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31064", "title": "The Star-Spangled Banner", "text": "The Star-Spangled Banner\n\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" is the national anthem of the United States. The lyrics come from the Defence of Fort M'Henry, a poem written on September 14, 1814, by the then 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships of the Royal Navy in Baltimore Harbor during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. Key was inspired by the large U.S. flag, with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the U.S. victory.\n\nThe poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a men's social club in London. \"To Anacreon in Heaven\" (or \"The Anacreontic Song\"), with various lyrics, was already popular in the United States. Set to Key's poem and renamed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", it soon became a well-known U.S. patriotic song. With a range of 19 semitones, it is known for being very difficult to sing. Although the poem has four stanzas, only the first is commonly sung today.\n\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was recognized for official use by the United States Navy in 1889, and by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3, 1931 (46 Stat. 1508, codified at ), which was signed by President Herbert Hoover.\n\nBefore 1931, other songs served as the hymns of U.S. officialdom. \"Hail, Columbia\" served this purpose at official functions for most of the 19th century. \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\", whose melody is identical to \"God Save the Queen\", the United Kingdom's national anthem, also served as a \"de facto\" national anthem. Following the War of 1812 and subsequent U.S. wars, other songs emerged to compete for popularity at public events, among them \"America the Beautiful\", which itself was being considered \"before\" 1931, as a candidate to become the national anthem of the United States.\n\nOn September 3, 1814, following the Burning of Washington and the Raid on Alexandria, Francis Scott Key and John Stuart Skinner set sail from Baltimore aboard the ship HMS \"Minden\", flying a flag of truce on a mission approved by President James Madison. Their objective was to secure an exchange of prisoners, one of whom was Dr. William Beanes, the elderly and popular town physician of Upper Marlboro and a friend of Key's who had been captured in his home. Beanes was accused of aiding the arrest of British soldiers. Key and Skinner boarded the British flagship HMS \"Tonnant\" on September 7 and spoke with Major General Robert Ross and Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane over dinner while the two officers discussed war plans. At first, Ross and Cochrane refused to release Beanes but relented after Key and Skinner showed them letters written by wounded British prisoners praising Beanes and other Americans for their kind treatment.\n\nBecause Key and Skinner had heard details of the plans for the attack on Baltimore, they were held captive until after the battle, first aboard HMS \"Surprise\" and later back on HMS \"Minden\". After the bombardment, certain British gunboats attempted to slip past the fort and effect a landing in a cove to the west of it, but they were turned away by fire from nearby Fort Covington, the city's last line of defense.\n\nDuring the rainy night, Key had witnessed the bombardment and observed that the fort's smaller \"storm flag\" continued to fly, but once the shell and Congreve rocket barrage had stopped, he would not know how the battle had turned out until dawn. On the morning of September 14, the storm flag had been lowered and the larger flag had been raised.\n\nDuring the bombardment, HMS \"Terror\" and HMS \"Meteor\" provided some of the \"bombs bursting in air\".\n\nKey was inspired by the U.S. victory and the sight of the large U.S. flag flying triumphantly above the fort. This flag, with fifteen stars and fifteen stripes, had been made by Mary Young Pickersgill together with other workers in her home on Baltimore's Pratt Street. The flag later came to be known as the Star-Spangled Banner and is today on display in the National Museum of American History, a treasure of the Smithsonian Institution. It was restored in 1914 by Amelia Fowler, and again in 1998 as part of an ongoing conservation program.\n\nAboard the ship the next day, Key wrote a poem on the back of a letter he had kept in his pocket. At twilight on September 16, he and Skinner were released in Baltimore. He completed the poem at the Indian Queen Hotel, where he was staying, and titled it \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\". It was first published nationally in \"The Analectic Magazine\".\n\nMuch of the idea of the poem, including the flag imagery and some of the wording, is derived from an earlier song by Key, also set to the tune of \"The Anacreontic Song\". The song, known as \"When the Warrior Returns\", was written in honor of Stephen Decatur and Charles Stewart on their return from the First Barbary War.\n\nAbsent elaboration by Francis Scott Key prior to his death in 1843, some have speculated in modern times about the meaning of phrases or verses. According to British historian Robin Blackburn, the words \"the hireling and slave\" allude to the thousands of ex-slaves in the British ranks organised as the Corps of Colonial Marines, who had been liberated by the British and demanded to be placed in the battle line \"where they might expect to meet their former masters.\" Nevertheless, Professor Mark Clague, a professor of musicology at the University of Michigan, argues that the \"middle two verses of Key's lyric vilify the British enemy in the War of 1812\" and \"in no way glorifies or celebrates slavery.\" Clague writes that \"For Key ... the British mercenaries were scoundrels and the Colonial Marines were traitors who threatened to spark a national insurrection.\" This harshly anti-British nature of Verse 3 led to its omission in sheet music in World War I, when the British and the U.S. were allies. Responding to the assertion of writer Jon Schwarz of \"The Intercept\" that the song is a \"celebration of slavery,\" Clague said that: \"The reference to slaves is about the use and in some sense the manipulation, of black Americans to fight for the British, with the promise of freedom. The American forces included African-Americans as well as whites. The term 'freemen,' whose heroism is celebrated in the fourth stanza, would have encompassed both.\"\n\nOthers suggest that \"Key may have intended the phrase as a reference to the British Navy's practice of impressment (kidnapping sailors and forcing them to fight in defense of the crown), or as a semi-metaphorical slap at the British invading force as a whole (which included a large number of mercenaries).\"\n\nKey gave the poem to his brother-in-law Judge Joseph H. Nicholson who saw that the words fit the popular melody \"The Anacreontic Song\", by English composer John Stafford Smith. This was the official song of the Anacreontic Society, an 18th-century gentlemen's club of amateur musicians in London. Nicholson took the poem to a printer in Baltimore, who anonymously made the first known broadside printing on September 17; of these, two known copies survive.\n\nOn September 20, both the \"Baltimore Patriot\" and \"The American\" printed the song, with the note \"Tune: Anacreon in Heaven\". The song quickly became popular, with seventeen newspapers from Georgia to New Hampshire printing it. Soon after, Thomas Carr of the Carr Music Store in Baltimore published the words and music together under the title \"The Star Spangled Banner\", although it was originally called \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\". Thomas Carr's arrangement introduced the raised fourth which became the standard deviation from \"The Anacreontic Song\". The song's popularity increased and its first public performance took place in October when Baltimore actor Ferdinand Durang sang it at Captain McCauley's tavern. Washington Irving, then editor of the \"Analectic Magazine\" in Philadelphia, reprinted the song in November 1814.\n\nBy the early 20th century, there were various versions of the song in popular use. Seeking a singular, standard version, President Woodrow Wilson tasked the U.S. Bureau of Education with providing that official version. In response, the Bureau enlisted the help of five musicians to agree upon an arrangement. Those musicians were Walter Damrosch, Will Earhart, Arnold J. Gantvoort, Oscar Sonneck and John Philip Sousa. The standardized version that was voted upon by these five musicians premiered at Carnegie Hall on December 5, 1917, in a program that included Edward Elgar's \"Carillon\" and Gabriel Pierné's \"The Children's Crusade\". The concert was put on by the Oratorio Society of New York and conducted by Walter Damrosch. An official handwritten version of the final votes of these five men has been found and shows all five men's votes tallied, measure by measure.\n\nThe song gained popularity throughout the 19th century and bands played it during public events, such as Independence Day celebrations.\n\nA plaque displayed at Fort Meade, South Dakota, claims that the idea of making \"The Star Spangled Banner\" the national anthem began on their parade ground in 1892. Colonel Caleb Carlton, Post Commander, established the tradition that the song be played \"at retreat and at the close of parades and concerts.\" Carlton explained the custom to Governor Sheldon of South Dakota who \"promised me that he would try to have the custom established among the state militia.\" Carlton wrote that after a similar discussion, Secretary of War, Daniel E. Lamont issued an order that it \"be played at every Army post every evening at retreat.\"\n\nIn 1899, the U.S. Navy officially adopted \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered that \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" be played at military and other appropriate occasions. The playing of the song two years later during the seventh-inning stretch of Game One of the 1918 World Series, and thereafter during each game of the series is often cited as the first instance that the anthem was played at a baseball game, though evidence shows that the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" was performed as early as 1897 at opening day ceremonies in Philadelphia and then more regularly at the Polo Grounds in New York City beginning in 1898. In any case, the tradition of performing the national anthem before \"every\" baseball game began in World War II.\n\nOn April 10, 1918, John Charles Linthicum, U.S. Congressman from Maryland, introduced a bill to officially recognize \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as the national anthem. The bill did not pass. On April 15, 1929, Linthicum introduced the bill again, his sixth time doing so. On November 3, 1929, Robert Ripley drew a panel in his syndicated cartoon, \"Ripley's Believe it or Not!\", saying \"Believe It or Not, America has no national anthem\".\n\nIn 1930, Veterans of Foreign Wars started a petition for the United States to officially recognize \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as the national anthem. Five million people signed the petition. The petition was presented to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary on January 31, 1930. On the same day, Elsie Jorss-Reilley and Grace Evelyn Boudlin sang the song to the Committee to refute the perception that it was too high pitched for a typical person to sing. The Committee voted in favor of sending the bill to the House floor for a vote. The House of Representatives passed the bill later that year. The Senate passed the bill on March 3, 1931. President Herbert Hoover signed the bill on March 4, 1931, officially adopting \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as the national anthem of the United States of America. As currently codified, the United States Code states that \"[t]he composition consisting of the words and music known as the Star-Spangled Banner is the national anthem.\"\n\nThe song is notoriously difficult for nonprofessionals to sing because of its wide rangea 12th. Humorist Richard Armour referred to the song's difficulty in his book \"It All Started With Columbus\".\n\nProfessional and amateur singers have been known to forget the words, which is one reason the song is sometimes pre-recorded and lip-synced. Other times the issue is avoided by having the performer(s) play the anthem instrumentally instead of singing it. The pre-recording of the anthem has become standard practice at some ballparks, such as Boston's Fenway Park, according to the SABR publication \"The Fenway Project\".\n\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" has been performed regularly at the beginning of NFL games since the end of WWII by order of NFL commissioner Elmer Layden, according to History.com . According to same article, the song has been intermittently performed at baseball games since after WWI It has also been popular as performed by orchestra or soloists at other public gatherings. The National Hockey League and Major League Soccer both require venues in both the U.S. and Canada to perform both the Canadian and U.S. national anthems at games that involve teams from both countries (with the \"away\" anthem being performed first). It is also usual for both U.S. and Canadian anthems (done in the same way as the NHL and MLS) to be played at Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association games involving the Toronto Blue Jays and the Toronto Raptors (respectively), the only Canadian teams in those two major U.S. sports leagues, and in All Star Games on the MLB, NBA, and NHL. The Buffalo Sabres of the NHL, which play in a city on the Canada–US border and have a substantial Canadian fan base, play both anthems before all home games regardless of where the visiting team is based.\n\nTwo especially unusual performances of the song took place in the immediate aftermath of the United States September 11 attacks. On September 12, 2001, the Queen broke with tradition and allowed the Band of the Coldstream Guards to perform the anthem at Buckingham Palace, London, at the ceremonial Changing of the Guard, as a gesture of support for Britain's ally. The following day at a St. Paul's Cathedral memorial service, the Queen joined in the singing of the anthem, an unprecedented occurrence.\n\nThe 200th anniversary of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" occurred in 2014 with various special events occurring throughout the United States. A particularly significant celebration occurred during the week of September 10–16 in and around Baltimore, Maryland. Highlights included playing of a new arrangement of the anthem arranged by John Williams and participation of President Obama on Defender's Day, September 12, 2014, at Fort McHenry. In addition, the anthem bicentennial included a youth music celebration including the presentation of the National Anthem Bicentennial Youth Challenge winning composition written by Noah Altshuler.\n\n \nThe first popular music performance of the anthem heard by the mainstream U.S. was by Puerto Rican singer and guitarist José Feliciano. He created a nationwide uproar when he strummed a slow, blues-style rendition of the song at Tiger Stadium in Detroit before game five of the 1968 World Series, between Detroit and St. Louis. This rendition started contemporary \"Star-Spangled Banner\" controversies. The response from many in the Vietnam War-era U.S. was generally negative. Despite the controversy, Feliciano's performance opened the door for the countless interpretations of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" heard in the years since. One week after Feliciano's performance, the anthem was in the news again when U.S. athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos lifted controversial raised fists at the 1968 Olympics while the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" played at a medal ceremony.\n\nMarvin Gaye gave a soul-influenced performance at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game and Whitney Houston gave a soulful rendition before Super Bowl XXV in 1991, which was released as a single that charted at number 20 in 1991 and number 6 in 2001 (along with José Feliciano, the only times the national anthem has been on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100). In 1993, Kiss did an instrumental rock version as the closing track on their album, \"Alive III\". Another famous instrumental interpretation is Jimi Hendrix's version, which was a set-list staple from autumn 1968 until his death in September 1970, including a famous rendition at the Woodstock music festival in 1969. Incorporating sonic effects to emphasize the \"rockets' red glare\", and \"bombs bursting in air\", it became a late-1960s emblem. Roseanne Barr gave a controversial performance of the anthem at a San Diego Padres baseball game at Jack Murphy Stadium on July 25, 1990. The comedian belted out a screechy rendition of the song, and afterward, she attempted a gesture of ballplayers by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup. The performance offended some, including the sitting U.S. President, George H. W. Bush. Sufjan Stevens has frequently performed the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" in live sets, replacing the optimism in the end of the first verse with a new coda that alludes to the divisive state of the nation today. David Lee Roth both referenced parts of the anthem and played part of a hard rock rendition of the anthem on his song, \"Yankee Rose\" on his 1986 solo album, \"Eat 'Em and Smile\". Steven Tyler also caused some controversy in 2001 (at the Indianapolis 500, to which he later issued a public apology) and again in 2012 (at the AFC Championship Game) with a cappella renditions of the song with changed lyrics. In 2016, Aretha Franklin performed a rendition before the nationally-televised Minnesota Vikings-Detroit Lions Thanksgiving Day game lasting more than four minutes and featuring a host of improvizations. It would be one of Franklin's last public appearances before her 2018 death. Black Eyed Peas-singer Fergie gave a controversial performance of the anthem in 2018. Critics likened her rendition to a jazzy \"sexed-up\" version of the anthem, which was considered highly inappropriate, with her performance compared to that of Marilyn Monroe's iconic performance of Happy Birthday, Mr. President. Fergie later apologized for her performance of the song, citing that <nowiki>\"I'm a risk taker artistically, but clearly this rendition didn'</nowiki>t strike the intended tone\".\n\nA version of Aerosmith's Joe Perry and Brad Whitford playing part of the song can be heard at the end of their version of \"Train Kept A-Rollin'\" on the \"Rockin' the Joint\" album. The band Boston gave an instrumental rock rendition of the anthem on their \"Greatest Hits\" album. The band Crush 40 made a version of the song as opening track from the album \"Thrill of the Feel\" (2000).\n\nIn March 2005, a government-sponsored program, the National Anthem Project, was launched after a Harris Interactive poll showed many adults knew neither the lyrics nor the history of the anthem.\n\nEighteen years after Key's death, and in indignation over the start of the American Civil War, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. added a fifth stanza to the song in 1861, which appeared in songbooks of the era. \n\nIn a version hand-written by Francis Scott Key in 1840, the third line reads \"Whose bright stars and broad stripes, through the clouds of the fight\". In honour of the 1986 rededication of the Statue of Liberty, Sandi Patty wrote her version of an additional verse to the anthem.\n\nSeveral films have their titles taken from the song's lyrics. These include two films titled \"Dawn's Early Light\" (2000 and 2005); two made-for-TV features titled \"By Dawn's Early Light\" (1990 and 2000); two films titled \"So Proudly We Hail\" (1943 and 1990); a feature film (1977) and a short (2005) titled \"Twilight's Last Gleaming\"; and four films titled \"Home of the Brave\"\n(1949, 1986, 2004, and 2006). A 1936 short titled \"The Song of a Nation\" from Warner Brothers shows a version of the origin of the song.\n\nWhen the U.S. national anthem was first recognized by law in 1931, there was no prescription as to behavior during its playing. On June 22, 1942, the law was revised indicating that those in uniform should salute during its playing, while others should simply stand at attention, men removing their hats. The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the national anthem, but not if the flag was not present. On December 23, 1942, the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played. That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed. Those in uniform were required to salute. On July 7, 1976, the law was simplified. Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts, men removing their hats, irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting. On August 12, 1998, the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions, but differentiating between \"those in uniform\" and \"members of the Armed Forces and veterans\" who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed. Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegiance versus the National Anthem, throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem, and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand (or hat) over their heart. After 9/11, the custom of placing the hand over the heart during the playing of the national anthem became nearly universal.\n\nSince 1998, federal law (viz., the United States Code ) states that during a rendition of the national anthem, when the flag is displayed, all present including those in uniform should stand at attention; Non-military service individuals should face the flag with the right hand over the heart; Members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are present and not in uniform may render the military salute; military service persons not in uniform should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold the headdress at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart; and Members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are in uniform should give the military salute at the first note of the anthem and maintain that position until the last note. The law further provides that when the flag is not displayed, all present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed. Military law requires all vehicles on the installation to stop when the song is played and all individuals outside to stand at attention and face the direction of the music and either salute, in uniform, or place the right hand over the heart, if out of uniform. The law was amended in 2008, and since allows military veterans to salute out of uniform, as well.\n\nThe text of is suggestive and not regulatory in nature. Failure to follow the suggestions is not a violation of the law. This behavioral requirement for the national anthem is subject to the same First Amendment controversies that surround the Pledge of Allegiance. For example, Jehovah's Witnesses do not sing the national anthem, though they are taught that standing is an \"ethical decision\" that individual believers must make based on their \"conscience.\"\n\nThe 1968 Olympics Black Power salute was a political demonstration conducted by African-American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos during their medal ceremony at the 1968 Summer Olympics in the Olympic Stadium in Mexico City. After having won gold and bronze medals respectively in the 200-meter running event, they turned on the podium to face their flags, and to hear the American national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Each athlete raised a black-gloved fist, and kept them raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist Peter Norman all wore human rights badges on their jackets. In his autobiography, \"Silent Gesture\", Smith stated that the gesture was not a \"Black Power\" salute, but a \"human rights salute\". The event is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern Olympic Games.\n\nPolitically motivated protests of the national anthem began in the National Football League (NFL) after San Francisco 49ers quarterback (QB) Colin Kaepernick sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, in response to police brutality in America, before his team's third preseason game of 2016. Kaepernick also sat during the first two preseason games, but he went unnoticed.\n\nIn November 2017, the California Chapter of the NAACP called on Congress to remove \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as the national anthem. Alice Huffman, California NAACP president said: \"it's racist; it doesn't represent our community, it's anti-black.\" The third stanza of the anthem, which is rarely sung and few know, contains the words, \"No refuge could save the hireling and slave, From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:\", which some interpret as racist. The organization was still seeking a representative to sponsor the legislation in Congress at the time of their announcement.\n\nAs a result of immigration to the United States and the incorporation of non-English speaking people into the country, the lyrics of the song have been translated into other languages. In 1861, it was translated into German. The Library of Congress also has record of a Spanish-language version from 1919. It has since been translated into Hebrew and Yiddish by Jewish immigrants, Latin American Spanish (with one version popularized during immigration reform protests in 2006), French by Acadians of Louisiana, Samoan, and Irish. The third verse of the anthem has also been translated into Latin.\n\nWith regard to the indigenous languages of North America, there are versions and Cherokee.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The television series premiered on BBC Two in the United Kingdom in April 2014.\n\nA third series, \"The Trip to Spain,\" was filmed in 2016. It premiered on Sky Atlantic in the United Kingdom on 6 April 2017 and was also edited into a feature film.\n\nIn an effort to impress his gourmet girlfriend, Mischa (Margo Stilley), actor Steve Coogan accepts a commission from \"The Observer\" to go on a restaurant tour of the north of England. When Mischa insists they take a break from their relationship, Steve invites colleague and friend-of-sorts Rob Brydon. On the trip, Coogan has a number of one-night stands, but is miserable professionally and personally, despite being the bigger star; Brydon, with his young family, is more content and laid-back. The two argue and attempt to outdo and humiliate each other with their impersonations of famous figures including Michael Caine and Sean Connery, especially in the presence of women.\n\nRob and Steve are commissioned to do another restaurant tour, this time in Italy from Piedmont to Capri, following in the footsteps of the great Romantic poets in the early 19th century on the Grand Tour.. While on the tour, Rob wins a part in an American Michael Mann film.\n\nRob and Steve are commissioned to do another restaurant tour, this time in Spain.\n\nCoogan and Brydon's roles as fictionalised versions of themselves are a continuation of their improvised performances in the film \"A Cock and Bull Story\" (2005), also directed by Michael Winterbottom. In an interview with \"The Guardian\", Coogan said he and Brydon exaggerated \"the aspects of ourselves that help the comedy ... I like playing with the fact that it might be me, to give it a bit more edge. So some of the conversations with Rob are funny, but some of them are very uncomfortable. They're sort of genuine arguments. It's a sort of an exaggeration of real life.\"\n\n\"The Trip\" received positive reviews. Andrea Mullaney of \"The Scotsman\" said that \"on paper, \"The Trip\" sounds bloody awful: a cosy, luvvie giant in-joke for Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon\", but went on to describe it as \"completely brilliant\" and \"hilarious\". Brian Viner of \"The Independent\" said: \"\"The Trip\" never fails to oblige. I love it for its originality and its daring.\" John Crace of \"The Guardian\" described the show as \"one of the funniest things on TV.\" Director Richard Curtis described the series as one of the greatest television programmes of all time at the 2013 British Comedy Awards.

It was established by and is still practised by the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. In addition to attending lectures and other classes, students are taught by faculty fellows in groups of one to three on a weekly basis. These sessions are called \"tutorials\" at Oxford and \"supervisions\" at Cambridge. One benefit of the tutorial system is that students receive direct feedback on their weekly essays or work in a small discussion setting. The University of Buckingham also practices the weekly tutorial system since it was set up as England's first private university in the 1970s.\n\nStudent tutorials are generally more academically challenging and rigorous than standard lecture and test format courses, because during each session students are expected to orally communicate, defend, analyse, and critique the ideas of others as well as their own in conversations with the tutor and fellow-students. As a pedagogic model, the tutorial system has great value because it creates learning and assessment opportunities which are highly authentic and difficult to fake.\n\nOutside the United Kingdom, a small number of universities have a tutorial system influenced by the Oxbridge system: Williams College in Massachusetts, Honors Tutorial College of Ohio University, Sarah Lawrence College in New York, and New College of Florida. These tutorials are often limited, either restricting them to those on an \"honors program\", or offering them as a single class rather than being the central feature of the university's teaching.\n\n"}

The group is part of the sovereign citizen movement, a movement whose members generally believe that they are not subject to any statutes or proceedings at the federal, state, or municipal levels.\n\nThe Washitaw Nation was headed by Verdiacee Hampton Goston (also known as Verdiacee Turner, also known as Empress Verdiacee Tiari Washitaw Turner Goston El-Bey, ca. 1927–2014). She was mayor of Richwood, Louisiana in 1975 and 1976, and again from 1980 to 1984. She is the author of the self-published book \"Return of the Ancient Ones\" (1993). Goston asserts that the United Nations \"registers the Washitaw as indigenous people No. 215\".\n\nIn 1999, the Southern Poverty Law Center estimated that the group had about 200 hard-core members, noting its popularity among followers of Moorish Science, a nationalist movement. The asserted legal basis for the establishment of the Washitaw Nation is a theory that individuals and groups may declare \"sovereignty\" and may separate themselves from state and federal governments, a concept earlier used by the Posse Comitatus. The argument is also made that Napoleon only sold \"the streets of New Orleans and a military barracks\" and that the rest of Louisiana was stolen from the Washitaw.\n\nVarious United States courts have held that the Washitaw Nation is fictional and that it is not recognized as a sovereign nation.\n\nThe Washitaw Nation is the accrediting agent for a diploma mill, the City University of Los Angeles.\n\n"}
{"id": "10470274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10470274", "title": "Year Zero (video game)", "text": "Year Zero (video game)\n\nYear Zero is an alternate reality game (ARG) by American studio 42 Entertainment based on the Nine Inch Nails concept album of the same name, its expected follow-up, and a possible accompanying film or television project. Although the album was released on April 16, 2007 in Europe, and the following day worldwide, the game had been underway since roughly February 12, 2007 and was expected to continue for approximately eighteen months. The game was created by 42 Entertainment, the same group responsible for the \"Halo 2\" promotional alternative reality game \"I Love Bees\". Trent Reznor, frontman and sole member of the band, has called the game \"a new entertainment form\". In response to criticism regarding the promotion of the album, Reznor stated:\n\nReznor said that \"Year Zero\" is a concept album, \"could be about the end of the world\", and marked a \"shift in direction\" in that it \"doesn't sound like \"With Teeth\".\" The 2006 tour merchandise designs featured overt references to the United States military, which \"reflects future directions.\"\n\nIn an interview with Gigwise.com, Reznor stated that the concept behind \"Year Zero\" was partially inspired by his feelings toward the Bush administration. He further explained,I really wanted to focus on something that was at the forefront of my consciousness which is, as an American, I'm appalled by the behavior of our government, the direction that it has taken and the direction that it's taken everyone else in the world and its arrogance... I decided to write an essay about where the world might be if we continue down the path that we're on with a neo-con-esque government doing whatever it pleases...\n\nTo this end, the storyline of \"Year Zero\" borrows heavily from such well-known dystopian fiction as George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" (government surveillance), Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" (use of drugs to subdue the populace), Ray Bradbury's \"Fahrenheit 451\" (large-scale censorship and uniformism), and Yevgeny Zamyatin's \"We\" (synthesis of church and state). Specific plot elements bear a resemblance to the Philip K. Dick short story \"Faith of Our Fathers\", including hallucinogens in the water supply, an oppressive, heavily militaristic state, aggressive government monitoring of the populace, and a venerated entity which manifests in many forms. In keeping with the dystopian theme, Year Zero takes place in 2022, the same year as the 1973 film \"Soylent Green\".\n\nThe story takes place in the United States in the year 2022, which has been termed \"Year 0\" by the US government, being the year that America was reborn. The U.S. had suffered several major terrorist attacks, including attacks on Los Angeles and Seattle. In response, the government granted itself emergency powers and seized absolute control on the country. The U.S. government is now a Christian fundamentalist theocracy, maintaining control of the populace through institutions like the Bureau of Morality and the First Evangelical Church of Plano, and locked into near constant war abroad against their aggressors, with the implied ulterior motive to expand their spheres of influence. Americans must get licenses to marry, bear children, etc. Subversive activities can result in these licenses being revoked. Dissenters regularly disappear from their homes in the night, and are detained in federal detainment centers and sanitariums, if not executed.\n\nThe government corporation Cedocore distributes the drug Parepin through the water supply, under the guise of it being an \"immune booster\" to prevent future bioterrorism attacks. However, Parepin is actually a psychoactive drug, engineered to reduce aggression, affect memory retention, and instill great credulity toward authority. As a result, most Americans who drink the water become apathetic and carefree; in addition, side effects such as schizophrenia-like behavior, muscle twitches, anorgasmia are implied to have effective treatment only in urban and developed areas, discouraging people moving to rural and remote areas with untreated water. There are several underground rebel groups, mainly operating online, most notably Art is Resistance and Solutions Backwards Initiative. The First Evangelical Church of Plano is a fundamentalist Protestant Christian church which is favored, and implied to be funded, by the neo-conservative government.\n\nAmidst all of this are increasing sightings of what is labelled \"The Presence\", which manifests as a pair of massive ghostly hands and arms extending down from the sky into the ground. Despite early attributions of The Presence to drug-induced mass hysteria, it soon becomes clear that it is a physical phenomenon capable of being recorded on video and film, although grainy and unfocused. Theories vary on the real cause of the appearances, but the prevailing opinion appears to be that the hands represent God or some other equivalent supernatural force. The sightings become more and more frequent, and those who are \"touched\" by the hand begin to report their experiences, mostly of a feeling of terror and clarity. On February 10, 2022, a government official named Doug is in his office tracking The Presence, while missing the birth of his daughter in Denver. He begins writing a letter to his then-unborn child, describing the state of the world and his family. Doug continually references The Presence, as more and more sightings are suddenly reported all around the planet at once. He says goodbye to his child, as the letter ends with a frantic, broken message that the Presence is above the Capitol Building and \"the stars are going out like candles\". It cuts off suddenly, implying reports that sightings of the phenomenon are rapidly being reported from all over the world. The sequence ends with a broken message announcing the appearance of The Presence over the United States Capitol Building. The message cuts off suddenly, implying the end of the world.\n\nMeanwhile, the Solutions Backwards Initiative - a group of students, professors, and computer experts - devise a successful means with which to send information back through time using quantum mechanics in order to prevent the dystopian future (and eventual apocalypse) they live in from ever occurring. The websites and music of the Year Zero alternate reality game are implied to be part of the information packets sent back through the wormholes, activated only moments after Doug's message.\n\nThe concept behind the \"Year Zero\" alternate reality game, as well as avid fan participation in the game, has caught the attention of the media numerous times; \"USA Today\" and \"Rolling Stone\" have cited fan site The NIN Hotline, forum Echoing the Sound, fan club The Spiral, and NinWiki as sources for new discoveries.\n\nIn March 2007 \"Kerrang! Radio\" reported that \"Reznor admitted he's already in talks about a movie version of his upcoming album a concept piece, with part two scheduled for next year.\" He had earlier noted \"Year Zero\" as \"part of a bigger picture of a number of things I'm working on. Essentially, I wrote the soundtrack to a movie that doesn't exist.\" Reznor has commented that he is currently more interested in a television project than a film project. He has stated that he has a producer and has met with writers.\nOn August 10, 2007, Reznor announced that they would soon be taking the concept to television networks in an attempt to secure a deal. \"We're about to pitch it to the network, so we're a couple of weeks away from meeting all of the main people, and we'll see what happens.\"\n\nSince first announcing his plans for a television series, progress has slowed, reportedly due to the 2007–2008 Writer's Guild strike. Despite this, Reznor has reported that the project is \"still churning along\".\n\nReznor clarified in November 2012 that the project was \"currently in a holding state\" due to himself and Rob Sheridan failing to \"find the right match with a writer\". In 2017, during an interview promoting new Nine Inch Nails EP \"Add Violence\", Reznor said that \"They got so far as hiring a writer for it, but then it fell to shit because we never had the right writer. I should have just done it [myself].\"\n\nMany reviewers of the \"Year Zero\" album also commented on the accompanying game. Ann Powers of \"The Los Angeles Times\" praised the album and game concept as \"a total marriage of the pop and gamer aesthetics that unlocks the rusty cages of the music industry and solves some key problems facing rock music as its cultural dominance dissolves into dust.\"\n\nIn 2008, 42 Entertainment won two Webby Awards for their work on the \"Year Zero\" game, under the categories of \"Integrated Campaigns\" and \"Other Advertising: Branded Content\". 42 Entertainment was also awarded three medals in The One Show's entertainment award ceremony, including a gold medal in the \"online gaming\" category, a silver in the \"music\" category, and a merit award in the \"online branded entertainment\" category.\n\n\n"}
