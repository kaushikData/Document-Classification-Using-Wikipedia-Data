The film was directed by Jack King and was released on September 21, 1935.\n\nIt is closing time at an animation studio and all the staff members are calling it a day. Meanwhile, an animator chooses to carry on with his work while a custodian keeps on watch. In his drawing, he sketches a dungeon scene where Beans the Cat encounters a goblin. Weary for working several hours continuously, the animator decides to take a little snooze. Before ending the session, he draws a steel barricade between the two characters to prevent the goblin from reaching Beans. Suddenly, the goblin comes to life and pulls him into the drawing. The goblin carries the animator away, heading somewhere beyond the scene.\n\nShocked and terrified, the animator tries in vain to break out of the goblin's grasp. He is then brought into a mystic chamber where painted portraits of various villains are displayed on the walls. The villains happened to be the animator's creations as well as those of his colleagues. They too come to life and emerge from their illustrations. As revenge for how he and other cartoonists made them get subdued in the end of each film, the villains give the animator a pencil and force him to draw a deep pit in the floor where they toss him inside. Upon falling in, the animator holds onto a branch, trying to avoid being devoured by the crocodile at the bottom.\n\nBack at the scene still being worked on, Beans still stands behind the barricade, boredly waiting for his artist to come back. Just then, Little Kitty comes to him, offering a lunchbox. Beans is expecting food but is a little surprised to find a saw in the bread. He uses it to cut his way out of the metal fence. Finally freeing himself, he goes around to find his animator.\n\nIn no time, Beans finds the chamber where his animator is being tormented. To intervene, he hurls a boot at the goblin, luring the villains away as they try to capture him. Beans manages to lose them somehow when he returns to the place to rescue the troubled man. The animator then receives a pencil from Beans and draws a ladder to climb out the pit. When the villains return, Beans squirts grease from a grease gun between the room's entrance and the pit. The villains slide on the grease mess and fall into the hole, except for the goblin, who attempts to escape from the hole, but is punched by the angry animator into it. To vanquish them for good, the animator removes the hole with an eraser. Beans and the animator shake hands for a work well done.\n\nIt turns out that what the animator went through was merely a dream, as he is awaken by the custodian. To his relief, he finds the drawing on his desk unchanged. Not wanting to recall his experience, the animator erases the goblin and the steel barricade, leaving only Beans in the picture. As a compliment to his little friend, he draws a platter with gelatin on top for Beans to eat.\n\nAccording to animation historian Michael Samerdyke, some classic Hollywood cartoons from the 1930s are \"too scary for children\" and \"A Cartoonist's Nightmare\" is one of them. He finds it to be a \"very inventive\" and interesting cartoon. Samerdyke notes that Beans the Cat had previously appeared in \"I Haven't Got a Hat\" (1935) as a tough little kitten. \"A Cartoonist's Nightmare\" casts Beans into the role of a hero. This gives \"a nice heroic moment\" for a character with a rather brief film career. Beans would not stay for long within the cast of characters of Warner Bros. Cartoons.\n\nTo Samerdyke, the main villain of the short (described as the goblin above) more closely resembles a gorilla. The rest of the villains seem to reside in the Villain Department of the studio. They sing their own villainous song: \"The tables are turned and now you are in our clutches\". It is sung to the tune of \"The Teddy Bears' Picnic\" (1907). The villains plan to dispose of the anonymous cartoonist, while Beans comes to the rescue. Beans is in effect rescuing his own creator. The cartoonist rewards him by drawing some ice cream and allowing the cat to enjoy it.\n\nThe film's setting is an animated cartoon studio. Samerdyke notes that the building is depicted in a state of severe disrepair. It somewhat resembles a prison. Samerdyke speculates that these elements of the film could reflect the actual working conditions of the animators employed by Leon Schlesinger. The film features interactions between a cartoonist and a living, sentient cartoon character (Beans). In this way it resembles (and foreshadows) \"Duck Amuck\" (1953) and \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988).\n\nTerry Lindvall and Matthew Melton have included this film in an analysis of reflexive cartoons, those whose narrative reveals something about the art of animation and filmmaking. The writers find that Jack King's \"A Cartoonist's Nightmare\" clearly draws a portrait of what animators feel about their craft. The opening scenes are telling. The scenes of the staff leaving the animation resemble crazy people leaving an asylum. The wife of the cartoonist attempts to pull him away from his work and fails. He is obsessively devoted to his work and claims that he has to \"finish tonight\". He eventually falls asleep at his own drawing board.\n\nThe cartoonist is pulled into the cartoon by a wicked character of his own creation. Lindvall and Melton find this scene to resemble a segment of \"\" (1983), \"It's a Good Life\" directed by Joe Dante. In this segment a live-action character is incarcerated in a cartoon television program. As the villain (described as a \"hairy monster\" by the writers), drags the captive cartoonist through the corridors of the studio, various sections are seen. Among them a gag department, a story department, a music department. The cartoon villains occupy a dungeon-like section of their own.\n\nRegarding the depiction of the other villains, each has been assigned a number of their own. For example, \"Battling Barney\" is #20 and \"Dirty Dan\" is #130. These characters have apparently been created by the cartoonist, products of his imagination. And they have reasons to resent him. They sing to him: \"It's our turn. Now you are in our clutches! We are creations from your pen, it's in your hands we lie; you always manage to have us sin, now by your own hand you die.\" The characters blame their creator for causing them to commit sins. They seem to argue that they are not inherently bad people, they have been drawn that way. A sentiment echoed in another film by Jessica Rabbit.\n\n\n"}

The film was produced by Everett Riskin, and starred Spencer Tracy, Irene Dunne and Van Johnson. The screenplay, written by Dalton Trumbo and Frederick Hazlitt Brennan, was adapted from a story by Chandler Sprague and David Boehm, for which they were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Story. \n\nThe film is notable for being Van Johnson's first major role. It also features the popular song \"I'll Get By (As Long as I Have You)\" by Fred Ahlert and Roy Turk, performed in the film by Irene Dunne.\n\nSteven Spielberg's 1989 film \"Always\" is a remake of \"A Guy Named Joe\", and stars Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter and John Goodman. \"Always\" updates the story for a 1989 setting, exchanging the World War II backdrop to one of aerial firefighting.\nPete Sandidge (Spencer Tracy) is the reckless pilot of a North American B-25 Mitchell bomber flying out of England during World War II. He is in love with Women Airforce Service Pilot Dorinda Durston (Irene Dunne), a civilian pilot ferrying aircraft across the Atlantic. Pete's commanding officer, \"Nails\" Kilpatrick (James Gleason), first transfers Pete and his crew to a base in Scotland, then offers him a transfer back to America to be a flight instructor. Dorinda begs him to accept; Pete agrees, but goes out on one last mission with his best friend Al Yackey (Ward Bond) to check out a German aircraft carrier. Wounded after an attack by an enemy fighter, Pete has his crew bail out before going on to bomb the carrier and then crashing into the sea.\n\nPete then finds himself walking in clouds, where he first recognizes an old friend, Dick Rumney (Barry Nelson). Pete suddenly becomes uneasy, remembering that Dick went down with his aircraft in a fiery crash. Pete tells Dick, \"Either I'm dead or I'm crazy.\" Dick answers, \"You're not crazy.\" Dick ushers Pete to a meeting with \"The General\" (Lionel Barrymore), who gives him an assignment. He is to be sent back to Earth, where a year has elapsed, to pass on his experience and knowledge to Ted Randall (Van Johnson) at flight school, then in the South Pacific, where Ted is a Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter pilot. Ted's commanding officer turns out to be Al Yackey.\n\nThe situation becomes complicated when Ted meets the still-grieving Dorinda. Al encourages Dorinda to give the young pilot a chance. The pair gradually fall in love; Ted proposes to her and she accepts, much to Pete's jealous dismay.\n\nWhen Dorinda finds out from Al that Ted has been given an extremely dangerous assignment to destroy the largest Japanese ammunition dump in the Pacific, she steals his aircraft. Pete guides her in completing the mission and returning to the base to Ted's embrace. Pete accepts what must be and walks away, his job done.\n\nAs appearing in screen credits:\n\n\"A Guy Named Joe\" introduced Van Johnson in his first major role. When the filming was partially completed in 1943, Johnson was in a serious automobile accident. The crash lacerated his forehead and damaged his skull so severely doctors inserted a plate in his head. MGM wanted to replace Johnson, but Tracy convinced the studio to suspend filming until Johnson could return to work, which he did after four months of recovery. He then went on to become a major star. Because the movie was filmed before and after the accident, Johnson can be seen without and with the forehead scars he bore from then on.\n\nOne of the other reasons Johnson was allowed to stay was because a deal was made that Tracy and director Victor Fleming had to stop making Dunne's life miserable on set. Although she had been excited to work with Tracy, the actor took an instant dislike to her and endlessly teased her, sometimes driving her to tears. The deal was made, and Dunne and Tracy took the extra time caused by Johnson's recovery to re-shoot some of the scenes where their hostility was noticeable.\n\nBudget restrictions precluded location shooting, and all the flying scenes were staged at the MGM Studios. For an air of authenticity, footage shot at various United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bases throughout the United States was incorporated via an exterior backdrop process. Authentic aircraft were used, although they remained firmly on the ground. The pivotal scene with Irene Dunne flying a Lockheed P-38 Lightning was recreated at Drew Field, Florida, utilizing a surplus P-38E which had been acquired from the USAAF, where it had been used as an instructional aircraft. Electric motors drove the propellers and allowed for an authentic run-up sequence. The miniature work was the product of the same MGM special effects team of A. Arnold Gillespie, Donald Jahrus and Warren Newcombe that would later be responsible for \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\" (1944).\n\nDuring the scene where Tracy's character dies, he was shown making a suicidal divebomb run on a German aircraft carrier, despite the fact that Germany has never had an operational aircraft carrier in service before or during World War II.\n\n\n\"A Guy Named Joe\" premiered at the Astor Theater in New York on 23 December 1943 to generally positive reviews. \"Life Magazine\" summed up the critical reaction: \"MGM's \"A Guy Named Joe\" manages to remain strong and exciting despite such weaknesses as verbosity and a climax that is pure 'Perils of Pauline'.\" Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" considered it \"a tricky excursion into metaphysical realms.\" that almost comes off.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated the team of David Boehm and Chandler Sprague for Best Original Story in 1944, which eventually went to Leo McCarey for \"Going My Way\", at the 17th Academy Awards.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nAccording to MGM records, the film earned $3,970,000 in the US and Canada, and $1,393,000 overseas, resulting in a profit of $1,066,000.\n\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

It originated in the decoration of \"majlis\" (the front parlour of traditional Arab homes) in the Asir province of Saudi Arabia and adjoining parts of Yemen. These wall paintings, typically in the form of a of mural or fresco, present geometric designs in bright colors. Called \"nagash\" in Arabic, the wall paintings are often considered a mark of pride for a woman.\n\nIt was inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2017 as Al-Qatt Al-Asiri.\n\nThe geometric designs and heavy lines seem to be adapted from the area’s textile and weaving patterns.\n\nWomen in the Asir region are traditionally responsible for plastering and painting the walls, corridors, and ceilings of their homes. A family’s wealth often is signified by the skill, color, and complexity of the paintings, with poorer homes decorated in basic straight, simple lines in red, green, yellow, and brown. Women within the same neighborhood sometimes compete to make the most vivid and extravagant designs. Several Saudi women have become famous as \"majlis\" painters, such as Fatima Abou Gahas. Women's artwork is heavily influenced by their love for music, their view of culture and general perception of life; for example, the artwork of more conservative women is more likely to feature conservative and modest colors.\n\nThe interior walls of the home are brightly painted, employing defined patterns of lines, triangles, squares, diagonals and tree-like patterns.\n\nWomen from the region sometimes sell miniature \"'Asiri\" houses as souvenirs and knickknacks, which are popular among Saudi city-dwellers, who find these colorful houses a source of wonder.\n\nThe Saudi provincial airport in Abha reflects the region's cultural heritage. Airport Director Abdul Aziz Abu Harba said that \"the seating arrangement at the airport lounge has been in the form of a traditional \"majlis\" and the walls are painted in various colors reflecting the natural beauty of Asir\".\n"}

The book was released in hardcover on April 7, 2004 by Miramax Books (USA) and Viking Press (UK) and a paperback edition was released the following year by Penguin. The book's title refers to rumors that one of the characters routinely gets her hair dyed a certain shade of blonde at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury goods department store in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe book follows an unnamed young socialite living in New York as she interacts with her best friend Julie and tries to find a successful romantic relationship. Initially she believes that she's found \"The One\" in the photographer Zack and the two become engaged, after which point Zack becomes emotionally abusive and unresponsive. Despite her best attempts to salvage the relationship, the protagonist is dumped by Zack. Not only does this harm her social standing, but the protagonist is psychologically devastated by the end of the relationship and becomes anorexic as a result. Things are not made much better by her mother's insistence that she return home to England (her family emigrated there during the narrator's childhood) and strike up a relationship with a local Earl that they haven't seen since a disastrous business transaction with her father years ago.\n\nThe protagonist goes through several terrible relationships with married men (she was told that they were single or separated) and finds herself drawn to and irritated by the filmmaker Charlie, who has started dating her friend Julie. The two eventually end up running into each other at a hotel one night after the protagonist's apartment is robbed. Despite some friction between the two, the protagonist finds that she genuinely likes Charlie, who tells her that he's broken up with Julie. The two end up having sex, something that weighs upon the protagonist's conscience since she has a rule against sleeping with a friend's ex-boyfriend. The following day Julie ends up finding out about the sexual encounter after questioning the protagonist about the night's events, upon which point she reveals that she and Charlie never broke up and tells the protagonist that she never wants to see her again. Since the friendship is gone, the protagonist decides to see Charlie again that night, as he had invited her to return for dinner. However the protagonist finds that Charlie has left, giving her the impression that he was just using her like the other men she has dated.\n\nShe ends up deciding to return to England, only for her car to break down partway to her parent's house. The protagonist manages to make it to the home owned by the Earl, where she runs into Charlie, who tells her that he is the Earl her mother wanted her to meet and that he had left the United States due to news of his father's death. At this point her mother arrives under the guise of taking the protagonist home, with the intention of making her way back into Charlie's mother's good graces. This all proves to be too much for the protagonist and before leaving, she tells Charlie that she hates him and that she can no longer trust him since he never trusted her with any of this information. After returning home the protagonist ends up talking with Julie (who has traveled to England), who confesses that she and Charlie had broken up when he'd said they had but that she'd covered up the information since traditionally Julie was always the one to end a relationship. This causes the protagonist to realize that Charlie had never intended to be dishonest and she eventually meets up with him at his home, where they reconcile and officially become a couple.\n\nCritical reception for \"Bergdorf Blondes\" has been polarized. Hannah Sampson, writing for Knight-Ridder, called it a \"superficial, vapid novel\" that \" refuses to be fun, interesting, witty or memorable.\" Rachel Cooke of \"The Guardian\" gave an overly negative review for \"Bergdorf Blondes\", writing, \"It is not that this book is badly written, nor even that it is poorly plotted ... It is simply that it is so horribly empty, a bilious swirl of superficial characters and sickly values.\"\n\nIn contrast, \"USA Today\" was more favorable in its review, writing that \"\"Blondes\" is an over-the-top, witty social comedy sure to put a spring in your step — whether you're walking in Manolos or Keds.\" \"People\" magazine gave the book two and a half stars out of four, commenting that \"\"Bergdorf Blondes\" is packed with delicious sociological observations, one-liners (\"Ralph Lauren is my drug of choice,\" declares someone named Muffy) and tart definitions (\"PJ\" is a private jet; \"Arizona\" is a euphemism for rehab; \"CBK\" is Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, possessor of ideal hair). But it's hard to care about the airhead-ed characters. One wishes Sykes had abandoned chick lit conventions and bared her Nars Candy Darling-varnished nails with an all-out Tom Wolfe-style satire. That would be worth stashing in an Hermès handbag.\"\n"}

It premiered on 29 April 1926 with Forrest Lamont performing, in Cincinnati. \"Castle Agrazant\" won a Bispham Memorial Medal Award in 1926.\n\nThe opera is set in Northern France in the aftermath of the Ninth Crusade - specified as 1290 in the program for the opera. Characters include Richard of Agrazant (Riego of Agrazant), a young crusader and religious zealot; and his wife Isabeau. In the story, the husband and crusader, Richard, returns to avenge his persecuted wife, Isabeau.\n\nIn the 1926 premier, Olga Forrai performed as Isabeau, Forrest Lamont performed as Richard, and Howard Preston as Geoffrey.\nThe Opera's performances included a chorus of 65 members and 60 members of the Cincinnati Symphony. The cost to stage the production in 1926 was $15,000 USD (approximately $183,000 in 2010 USD).\n\nThe Opera was also broadcast by radio station WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio on May 3, 1926.\n\nIsabeau is mourning the death of her newborn daughter, alone. Count Lisiac, a former suitor of Isabeau, seizes the opportunity of her husband's absence and her grief to approach Isabeau. When his attempts fail he turns to violence, assaulting the Castle Agrazant and kidnapping Isabeau. Isabeau conceals a note giving details of her abduction before she is taken.\n\nElsewhere, Richard of Agrazant is returning from Jerusalem. He passes Lisiac Hall ignorant that his wife is imprisoned there. He arrives at Castle Agrazant and sees evidence of the assault. He finds his daughter dead in the cradle and the note from Isabeau. He pledges \nrevenge.\n\nIsabeau is feted at Lisiac Hall, but takes no part in the celebrations. Geoffrey becomes inebriated and is more forward with Isabeau. As events spin out of control, Geoffrey's men debate protecting Isabeau from Geoffrey. A herald then announces the arrival of traveling\nmusicians - a monk, a minstrel, and a boy. Geoffrey commands them to perform but asks Isabeau to select a happy song. She requests a song of Nazareth, and Richard (disguised as the monk) thereby confirms she has no desire to stay with Geoffrey.\n\nThe Boy then sings of the recent assault of Castle Agrazant, to the astonishment of Geoffrey and his men. Filled with superstitious dread, Lisiac orders the musicians cast out. The Monk interjects, offering to sing a different song - and his voice is recognized by Isabeau as her Richard's. Richard sings of his love for Isabeau and remorse at going to Jerusalem and leaving 'far from home and wife and child'.\n\nRemoving his disguise, Richard challenges Geoffrey and a melee ensues. In the melee, Isabeau is stabbed by Geoffrey; Geoffrey is run through by Richard's sword. Richard seizes Isabeau and escapes, followed by the boy and musician.\n\nRichard enters, assisting Isabeau. She asks to rest and Richard encourages her to continue on. She weakens further, they do rest, apparently sleeping for the night. In the morning, Richard uses his helmet to fetch water and tells of his visit to Jerusalem. His assessment is that his crusade was in error, he sacrificed all that was worthy in its pursuit. He breaks his blade. Placing the fragments on a rock, he returns to Isabeau. Isabeau bemoans their sad fate and begins to hallucinate that she is comforting her daughter; she hears the horns of Lisiac approaching. She and Richard sing a duet extolling the possibility of living in a brighter realm in the future, forever.\n"}

{"id": "41973145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41973145", "title": "Critical anthropomorphism", "text": "Critical anthropomorphism\n\nCritical anthropomorphism (from ethology and comparative psychology) refers to a perspective in the study of animal behavior that encompasses using the sentience of the observer to generate hypotheses in light of scientific knowledge of the species, its perceptual world, and ecological and evolutionary history. The term is of particular relevance to mentalistic behavioral mechanisms, and its application involves using \"natural history, our perceptions, intuitions, feelings, careful behavioral descriptions, identifying with the animal, optimization models, previous studies and so forth in order to generate ideas that may prove useful in gaining understanding and the ability to predict outcomes of planned (experimental) and unplanned interventions\".\n\nGordon Burghardt introduced the term \"critical anthropomorphism\" in the mid 1980s in an essay tracing historical views on animal awareness and cognition. Though not by name, the concept of critical anthropomorphism has historical roots dating to Jakob von Uexküll's \"umwelt\" and \"innenwelt\" (German for \"environment/surroundings\" and \"inner world\", respectively). Jakob von Uexküll studied numerous organisms with diverse sensory processes and surmised that our understanding of how these processes work, and the perceptions that result from them (comprising the innenwelt), give us insight into the behavior and experiences of nonhuman species. von Uexküll pointed out that although different species share the same physical environment, the relationship between the innenwelt and umwelt of each species is unique because of their adaptively specialized capacities. The concepts of the umwelt and innenwelt were germane to classical ethology (e.g. Nikolaas Tinbergen, Konrad Lorenz, Karl von Frisch) as they reminded scientists of the importance of considering the perspective of the organism under study in the design, observation and interpretation of research studies involving nonhuman species. As noted by Burghardt, critically anthropomorphic approaches are evident in early animal work that recognized the possibility of cognitive processes in animals (e.g., Edward Chace Tolman's work on cognitive maps).\n\nThe critically anthropomorphic approach has been applied to numerous species and behavioral and cognitive capacities. Burghardt and Rivas describe case histories of how critical anthropomorphism informed the design and interpretation of animal behavior research. The examples include foraging tactics in snakes, aposematic (warning) coloration, courtship behavior in the \"Drosophila\" fruit fly, language and communication, zoo exhibit design, and conservation planning for wildlife management. Rivas and Burghardt also used critical anthropomorphism to explain female biased sexual dimorphism in anacondas and other snakes.\n\nHistorically, an idea like critical anthropomorphism would be at odds with behaviorism, but some contemporary investigators of animal conditioning and learning take exception. For example, Timberlake and Delmater (1991) argued that behaviorists should relax their mechanistic constraints and consider the sensory and perceptual worlds of nonhuman species:\nThe concept of an inner world is akin to subjective states, putting it at odds with behaviorism, particularly radical behaviorism. However, even historically ardent critics of using anecdotes and rich interpretation of animal behavior, such as Conwy Lloyd Morgan, recognized that studying the behavior of other organisms requires introspection on the part of the observer. Morgan argued that studying the behavior of other organisms was a doubly inductive process. It begins with observation and description of the animal, and then subjective induction of that behavior based on the observer's own understanding of his or her own conscious experience. Morgan argued that introspection on the part of the observer is essential to understanding the behavior of others, and remained clear on the point that it was essential to remain critical and objective when doing so. Clive Wynne, a vocal critic of \"any\" form of anthropomorphism, considers the alternatives espoused by scientists, such as critical anthropomorphism or biocentric anthropomorphism to be nonscientific. Wynne discusses the history of anthropomorphism through George Henry Lewes, George Romanes, and Charles Darwin to elaborate on pitfalls, limitations, and the arguably nonscientific status of anthropomorphism. In doing so Wynne attempts to make the case that modern versions such as critical anthropomorphism are no better than its historical predecessors.\n\nBurghardt counters Wynne's arguments by pointing out that: 1) critical anthropomorphism is not by itself intended to be a description and explanation of behavior, but rather as a heuristic for generating testable hypotheses, 2) critical anthropomorphism can and has been used to avoid ill-conceived studies of animal behavior, 3) denying our status as animals and that we might share similar experiences of the world with nonhuman species is itself erroneous, and 4) mentalistic explanations of behavior are not, as Wynne suggests, equal to supernatural ones.\n"}

These threats are often designed to intimidate victims in order to manipulate their behaviour, and thus a death threat can be a form of coercion. For example, a death threat could be used to dissuade a public figure from pursuing a criminal investigation or an advocacy campaign.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, death threats are a serious type of criminal offence. Death threats are often covered by coercion statutes. For instance, the coercion statute in Alaska says:\nA death threat can be communicated via a wide range of media, among these letters, newspaper publications, telephone calls, internet blogs and e-mail. If the threat is made against a political figure, it can also be considered treason. If a threat is against a non-living location that frequently contains living individuals (e.g. a building), it could be a terrorist threat. Sometimes, death threats are part of a wider campaign of abuse targeting a person or a group of people (see terrorism, mass murder).\n\nIn some monarchies and republics, both democratic and authoritarian, threatening to kill the head of state and/or head of government (such as the sovereign, president, or prime minister), is considered a crime, for which punishments vary. The United States law provides for up to five years in prison for threatening any type of government official. In the United Kingdom, under the Treason Felony Act 1848, it is illegal to attempt to kill or deprive the monarch of his/her throne; this offense was originally punished with penal transportation, and then was changed to the death penalty, and currently the penalty is life imprisonment.\n\nNamed after a high-profile case, \"Osman v United Kingdom\", these are warnings of death threat or high risk of murder that are issued by British police or legal authorities to the possible victim. They are used when there is intelligence of the threat, but there is not enough evidence to justify the police arresting the potential murderer.\n\n\n"}

Nabokov published a second English translation in 1965; this is now the only English translation in print.\n\nThe narrator and protagonist of the story, Hermann Karlovich, a Russian of German descent and owner of a chocolate factory, meets a homeless man in the city of Prague, whom he believes is his doppelgänger. Even though Felix, the supposed doppelgänger, is seemingly unaware of their resemblance, Hermann insists that their likeness is most striking. Hermann is married to Lydia, a sometimes silly and forgetful wife (according to Hermann) who has a cousin named Ardalion. It is heavily hinted that Lydia and Ardalion are, in fact, lovers, although Hermann continually stresses how much Lydia loves him. On one occasion Hermann actually walks in on the pair, naked, but Hermann appears to be completely oblivious of the situation, perhaps deliberately so. After some time, Hermann shares with Felix a plan for both of them to profit off their shared likeness by having Felix briefly pretend to be Hermann. But after Felix is disguised as Hermann, Hermann kills Felix in order to collect the insurance money on Hermann on March 9. Hermann considers the presumably perfect murder plot to be a work of art rather than a scheme to gain money. But as it turns out, there is no resemblance whatsoever between the two men, the murder is not 'perfect', and the murderer is about to be captured by the police in a small hotel in France, where he is hiding. Hermann who is writing the narrative switches to a diary mode at the very end just before his captivity, the last entry is on April 1.\n\nNabokov began to compose \"Despair\" while he was living in Berlin beginning in July 1932 and managed to complete the first draft on September 10 of the same year. The year in which Nabokov was writing Despair was a turbulent one for Germany. In June 1932, the Reichstag had collapsed and Incumbent President President Paul von Hindenburg called for elections, leading to violence between the Nazis and Communists. It would not be long before the Nazi party would come into prominence and Hitler appointed as chancellor. This would only fuel Nabokov's hatred for totalitarian governments, and this disdain was incorporated somewhat into \"Despair\" (Hermann is pro-Communist) and more prominently later on in \"Invitation to a Beheading\" (1936), Nabokov's next novel.\n\nIn 1935, Nabokov began to become increasingly intrigued with the English language and elected to translate his two most recently written novels at the time, \"Laughter in the Dark\" (1932) (first translated as \"Camera Obscura\") and \"Despair\". Nabokov remarked that translating \"Despair\" was his \"first serious attempt... to use English for what may loosely termed an artistic purpose\" and finished on December 29 later that year. Nabokov sent the manuscript to Hutchinson & Co. in April 1936 and although the company had initial reservations, eventually agreed to publish the book and the translation was checked by a Molly Carpenter-Lee, a student of Nabokov's friend Gleb Struve. The book was a complete flop commercially and Nabokov only earned €40, a minuscule amount, even in the 1930s. The issue was that Hutchinson's only published cheap, \"popular\" novels, which \"Despair\" was not and thus, it was distributed to the wrong audience. Nabokov would later lament that \"Despair\" was \"a rhinoceros in a world of hummingbirds\".\n\nNabokov intended Hermann, and the novel in general, to be kind of a Dostoevskian (who is referred to as \"Dusky and Dusty\" in the novel) parody; this is even more evident as the original working title for the novel was to be \"Zapiski mistifikatora\" (\"Notes of a Hoaxer\"), akin to Dostoevsky's \"Notes from Underground\". At one particular, Hermann even contemplates titling his narrative \"The Double\", before he realizes it has been used, and opts for \"Despair\" instead. Nabokov infamously despised Dostoevsky's writing, with its excessive soul-searching and glorification of criminals and prostitutes and this is reflected in \"Despair\" and Hermann, who carries certain similarities to Raskolnikov, who had also planned a perfect murder in \"Crime and Punishment\". Additionally, the book is rich in intertextual connections to other authors such as Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev, Oscar Wilde, and Conan Doyle.\n\n\"Despair\" is generally acclaimed as one of Nabokov's better Russian novels, along with \"Invitation to a Beheading\" and \"The Gift\" (1938), and has a reasonable volume of literary criticism. British author Martin Amis ranked it second on his list of best Nabokov novels, with it trailing only \"Lolita\" (1955). However, Nabokov's biographer Brian Boyd seemed to have ambivalent feelings toward \"Despair\", noting that although \"Nabokov's sheer intelligence crackles in every line... the book's style... seems sadly lacking in its structure... It never quite convinces, and page after page that would make one tingle with excitement in another context can here only intermittently overcome one's remoteness from a story whose central premise fails to merit the suspension of disbelief\".\n\n\"Despair\" is the second Nabokov novel to feature unreliable narration from a first-person point of view, the first being \"The Eye\" with the character Smurov. However, \"The Eye\" was more of an experiment condensed in a hundred-page novella, whereas \"Despair\" takes the unreliable first-person narrator to its fully fledged form, rivaling Humbert Humbert from \"Lolita\", and Hermann is in a sense, Humbert's Russian cousin. Nabokov comments on this in the Foreword to the later edition of Despair, where he remarks that \"Hermann and Humbert are alike only in the sense that two dragons painted by the same artist at different periods of his life resemble each other. Both are neurotic scoundrels, yet there is a green lane in Paradise where Humbert is permitted to wander at dusk once a year; but Hell shall never parole Hermann\". To put it simply, the reader can never be positive if Hermann is accurately narrating the events because he tends to conflate his own skills and talents while ignoring reality around him.\n\nAdditionally, Despair is also a tale of false doubles, one of Nabokov's favorite themes. The very title of the novel announces this theme as French-speaking Nabokov chose a word (despair) which in French means 'some pairs', or simply 'pairs' (\"des paires\"). But it also means, so to speak, 'to undo a pair', to 'dis-pair', i.e. the process going on in the novel by which the pair Hermann thought did exist actually revealed itself false. In it, doubling seems to be only an obsession with physical resemblances. Almost all of Nabokov's fictions make ample use of doubling, duplication, and mirroring, such as in \"Pale Fire\" and \"Lolita\".\n\nVladislav Khodasevich had pointed out that Nabokov is obsessed with a single theme: \"the nature of the creative process and the solitary, freak-life role into which a man with such imagination is inevitably cast..\" Hermann who sees himself as an artist composing the 'perfect murder' fits this description. In a similar fashion, Julian Connolly calls \"Despair\" “a cautionary tale of creative solipsism”.\n\nIn 1978 the novel was adapted into the film \"Despair\", directed by the German film-maker Rainer Werner Fassbinder and starring Dirk Bogarde. Nabokov's novel was adapted by Tom Stoppard.\n\nBoyd, Brian. \"Vladimir Nabokov: The Russian Years\". Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1991.

Erotic art may use any artistic form to depict erotic content, including painting, sculpture, drama, film or music. Erotic literature and erotic photography have become genres in their own right.\n\nCuriosa is erotica and pornography as discrete, collectable items, usually in published or printed form. In the antiquarian book trade, pornographic works are often listed under \"curiosa\", \"erotica\" or \"facetiae\".\n\nDistinction is often made between erotica and pornography (as well as the lesser known genre of sexual entertainment, ribaldry), although some viewers may not distinguish between them. A key distinction, some have argued, is that pornography's objective is the graphic depiction of sexually explicit scenes, while erotica \"seeks to tell a story that involves sexual themes\" that include a more plausible depiction of human sexuality than in pornography. Additionally, works considered degrading or exploitative tend to be classified by those who see them as such, as \"porn\" rather than as \"erotica\" and consequently, pornography is often described as exploitative or degrading.\n\nFeminist writer Gloria Steinem distinguishes erotica from pornography, writing: \"Erotica is as different from pornography as love is from rape, as dignity is from humiliation, as partnership is from slavery, as pleasure is from pain.\" Steinem's argument hinges on the distinction between reciprocity versus domination, as she writes: \"Blatant or subtle, pornography involves no equal power or mutuality. In fact, much of the tension and drama comes from the clear idea that one person is dominating the other.\"\n\n\n"}

It was designed in 1849 and officially adopted May 20, 1902.\n\nIt is one of the two flags of a currently socialist country (the other being Laos) that does not use any communist symbolism.\n\nAfter fighting for the Spanish Crown against the rebel armies of Venezuela, Narciso López moved from his native Caracas to Havana, Cuba. His involvement in anti-colonial movements forced him into exile. In 1849 he moved to New York City, where he continued to advocate for an independent Cuba.\n\nThe three blue stripes represent the three departments in which Cuba was divided at that time, the white purity of ideals, the light; the red triangle, originating from the French Revolution – and the three ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity: red for the blood and the courage; the star was the new state that should be added to the United States.\n\nThe poet Miguel Teurbe Tolón designed the flag alongside López, based upon the story of López's vision. Emilia Teurbe Tolón, Miguel's wife, sewed the first flag. López and Tolón, together with José Aniceto Iznaga Borrell, his nephew José María Sánchez Iznaga, Cirilo Villaverde and Juan Manuel Macias, settled upon the final design for the flag of Cuba: two white stripes, three blue, a red triangle, a lone star.\n\nNarciso López used this same flag in 1850 to carry out his coup attempt to liberate Cuba from Spanish rule, which resulted in failure. The coastal town of Cardenas was the first town that saw the lone star flag hoisted on May 19, 1850, in the taking of the city by Cuban rebels.\n\nA year after the start of the Ten Years' War, the first Constituent Assembly of the Republic of Cuba met arms in Guáimaro, Camagüey Province. The debate focused between two flags of great symbolism, the Demajagua – which was very similar to the Chilean flag – created by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes to give start to the war of independence, and the Lone Star of Narciso López, the latter being chosen since Narciso López had taken the first step for the freedom of Cuba. The Demajagua flag was not scrapped, but instead, was put in the sessions of the House of Representatives and retained as part of the national treasure.\n\nOn the morning of May 20, 1902, the day Cuba officially became an independent republic, Generalissimo Máximo Gómez had the honor of hoisting the flag on the flagpole of the castles of the Tres Reyes del Morro, Havana; therefore sealing with this act the end of the Cuban revolution, the end of struggle for Cuban independence, and at the same time justifying the sacrifice that so many offered to make this dream become reality.\n\nBoth the flag and the coat of arms were designed by Miguel Teurbe Tolón. The design of both specifications were established by decree of the first President of Cuba, Tomás Estrada Palma, on April 21, 1906, and have remained unchanged since then.\n\nIn April 1869, Narciso López's flag was designated the national banner by the Congress of the Republic of Cuba. López's flag was the model for the flag of Puerto Rico adopted in 1892 by the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee, a pro-independence group that worked under the auspices of Cuban Revolutionary Party.\n\nAfter the United States seized Cuba from Spain during the Spanish–American War, the U.S. flag flew from January 1, 1899, until independence was granted. On May 20, 1902, the Cuban national flag was hoisted as a symbol of independence and sovereignty. It has been used ever since, remaining unchanged after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. During the revolution, Cuban president Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement created a party flag equally divided in red and black like the Angolan national flag usually in horizontal stripes and often with inscriptions, which is often flown on public buildings.\n\nThe Cuban flag is at a length-to-width ratio of 2:1. The blue and white alternating stripes are of equal width. The red chevron is in the shape of an equilateral triangle that does not extend to the middle of the flag. The star within the chevron has a radius that is the length of the hoist. Its middle is halfway up the flag.\n\n\n"}

It is the same as the flag that was originally adopted when the country declared its independence from Portugal in 1975, nine days before being invaded by Indonesia. At midnight on 19 May 2002, and during the first moments of Independence Day the next day, the United Nations flag was lowered and the flag of an independent East Timor was raised.\n\nAs per the Constitution of East Timor, the yellow (PMS 123) triangle represents \"the traces of colonialism in East Timor's history\".

The song became the anthem of the bloodless People Power Revolution. The lyrics of the song are inscribed on a wall of Our Lady of EDSA Shrine, the center of the revolution.\n\nSongwriter Jim Paredes wrote the song in three minutes, with no revisions, using the success of the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution as his inspiration. After finishing the composition, he sent it to WEA Records, who at that time is compiling an album of patriotic songs. The song eventually became its carrier single. The song was then performed by artists who became actively involved during the People Power Revolution. An English version of this song was also made entitled \"A New and Better Way - The People's Anthem\", released in Australia and the United Kingdom. Both the original and English version were released as singles, with the proceeds to be donated for the rehabilitation of DZRV, which its main transmitter was destroyed by Marcos' troops while covering the events of the EDSA Revolution.\n\nThe English version of the single includes a letter from Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin.\n\nA music video was also made for the song made by director Mike de Leon. Kris Aquino, then a teenager, also appeared in the music video, together with the artists that rendered the song. National heroes since the Spanish period like Jose Rizal and Andres Bonifacio, prominent anti-Marcos figures and scenes from the revolution were also featured. The video was removed by censors shortly after it aired in television as the video containing crowds battering pictures of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos might be \"too strong\" to the public. The music video reappeared decades after through the Filipino music channel Myx and was uploaded in YouTube under Jim Paredes' account.\n\n\nAs part of the 25th Anniversary of the EDSA Revolution, broadcast television network ABS-CBN created a cover version of the song, with slightly different arrangements.\n\n\"In order of appearance\"\n\n\nDuring the funeral of Corazon Aquino, the song was performed by several artists that includes the APO Hiking Society, Jose Mari Chan, Sarah Geronimo, Piolo Pascual, Lea Salonga, Regine Velasquez, Ogie Alcasid, Zsa Zsa Padilla, Martin Nievera, Erik Santos, Jed Madela and Dulce.\n\n"}
{"id": "3376041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3376041", "title": "History of aesthetics before the 20th century", "text": "History of aesthetics before the 20th century\n\nThis description of the history of aesthetics before the twentieth century is based on an article from the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition.\n\nThe first important contributions to aesthetic theory are usually considered to stem from philosophers in Ancient Greece, among which the most noticeable are Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus. When interpreting writings from this time, it is worth noticing that it is debatable whether an exact equivalent to the term beauty existed in classical Greek.\n\nXenophon regarded the beautiful as coincident with the good, while both of these concepts are resolvable into the useful. Every beautiful object is so called because it serves some rational end: either the security or the gratification of man. Socrates rather emphasized the power of beauty to further the more necessary ends of life than the immediate gratification which a beautiful object affords to perception and contemplation. His doctrine puts forward the relativity of beauty. Plato, in contrast, recognized that beauty exists as an abstract \"Form\". It is therefore absolute and does not necessarily stand in relation to a percipient mind.\n\nOf the views of Plato on the subject, it is hardly less difficult to gain a clear conception from the \"Dialogues\", than it is in the case of ethical good. In some of these, various definitions of the beautiful are rejected as inadequate by the Platonic Socrates. At the same time we may conclude that Plato's mind leaned decidedly to the conception of an absolute beauty, which took its place in his scheme of ideas or self-existing forms. This true beauty is nothing discoverable as an attribute in another thing, for these are only beautiful things, not the beautiful itself. Love (Eros) produces aspiration towards this pure idea. Elsewhere the soul's intuition of the self-beautiful is said to be a reminiscence of its prenatal existence. As to the precise forms in which the idea of beauty reveals itself, Plato is not very decided. His theory of an absolute beauty does not easily adjust itself to the notion of its contributing merely a variety of sensuous pleasure, to which he appears to lean in some dialogues. He tends to identify the self-beautiful with the conceptions of the true and the good, and thus there arose the Platonic formula kalokagathia. So far as his writings embody the notion of any common element in beautiful objects, it is proportion, harmony or unity among their parts. He emphasizes unity in its simplest aspect as seen in evenness of line and purity of color. He recognizes in places the beauty of the mind, and seems to think that the highest beauty of proportion is to be found in the union of a beautiful mind with a beautiful body. He had but a poor opinion of art, regarding it as a trick of imitation (mimesis) which takes us another step further from the luminous sphere of rational intuition into the shadowy region of the semblances of sense. Accordingly, in his scheme for an ideal republic, he provided for the most inexorable censorship of poets, etc., so as to make art as far as possible an instrument of moral and political training.\n\nAn example of Plato's considerations about poetry is: \"For the authors of those great poems which we admire, do not attain to excellence through the rules of any art; but they utter their beautiful melodies of verse in a state of inspiration, and, as it were, possessed by a spirit not their own.\"\n\nAristotle, in contrast to Plato, developed certain principles of beauty and art, most clearly so in his treatises on poetry and rhetoric. He saw the absence of all lust or desire in the pleasure it bestows as another characteristic of the beautiful. Aristotle finds (in the \"Metaphysics\") the universal elements of beauty to be order (taxis), symmetry and definiteness or determinateness (to orismenon). In the \"Poetics\" he adds another essential, namely, a certain magnitude; the object should not be too large, while clearness of perception requires that it should not be too small.\n\nAristotle was passionate about goodness in men as he valued \"taking [its] virtues to be central to a well-lived life.\" In \"Politics\", he writes, \"Again, men in general desire the good, and not merely what their fathers had.\" To thoroughly comprehend goodness, Aristotle also studied Beauty. As noted in the Encyclopædia Britannica (1902), moreover, Aristotle, \"ignores all conceptions of an absolute Beauty, and at the same time seeks to distinguish the Beautiful from the Good.\" Aristotle explains that men \"will be better able to achieve [their] good if [they] develop a fuller understanding of what it is to flourish.\" He nonetheless seeks (in the \"Metaphysics\") to distinguish the good and the beautiful by saying that the former is always in action (`en praxei) whereas the latter may exist in motionless things as well (`en akinetois.) At the same time he allowed that the good might under certain conditions be called beautiful. He further distinguished the beautiful from the fit, and in a passage of the \"Politics\" set beauty above the useful and necessary.\n\nAristotle's views on fine art distinctly recognized (in the \"Politics\" and elsewhere) that the aim of art is immediate pleasure, as distinct from utility, which is the end of the mechanical arts. He took a higher view of artistic imitation than Plato, holding that it implied knowledge and discovery, that its objects not only comprised particular things which happen to exist, but contemplated what is probable and what necessarily exists. In the \"Poetics\" he declares poetry to be more philosophical and serious a matter (spoudaiteron) than History. He gives us no complete classification of the fine arts, and it is doubtful how far his principles, e.g. his idea of a purification of the passions by tragedy, are to be taken as applicable to other than the poetic art.\n\nOf the later Greek and Roman writers the Neo-Platonist Plotinus deserves to be mentioned. According to him, objective reason (nous) as self-moving, becomes the formative influence which reduces dead matter to form. Matter when thus formed becomes a notion (logos), and its form is beauty. Objects are ugly so far as they are unacted upon by reason, and therefore formless. The creative reason is absolute beauty, and is called the more than beautiful. There are three degrees or stages of manifested beauty: that of human reason, which is the highest; of the human soul, which is less perfect through its connexion with a material body; and of real objects, which is the lowest manifestation of all. As to the precise forms of beauty, he supposed, in opposition to Aristotle, that a single thing not divisible into parts might be beautiful through its unity and simplicity. He gives a high place to the beauty of colours in which material darkness is overpowered by light and warmth. In reference to artistic beauty he said that when the artist has notions as models for his creations, these may become more beautiful than natural objects. This is clearly a step away from Plato's doctrine towards our modern conception of artistic idealization.\n\nSurviving medieval art is primarily religious in focus and funded largely by the State, Roman Catholic or Orthodox church, powerful ecclesiastical individuals, or wealthy secular patrons. These art pieces often served a liturgical function, whether as chalices or even as church buildings themselves. Objects of fine art from this period were frequently made from rare and valuable materials, such as gold and lapis, the cost of which commonly exceeded the wages of the artist.\n\nMedieval aesthetics in the realm of philosophy built upon Classical thought, continuing the practice of Plotinus by employing theological terminology in its explications. St. Bonaventure's \"Retracing the Arts to Theology\", a primary example of this method, discusses the skills of the artisan as gifts given by God for the purpose of disclosing God to mankind, which purpose is achieved through four lights: the light of skill in mechanical arts which discloses the world of artifacts; which light is guided by the light of sense perception which discloses the world of natural forms; which light, consequently, is guided by the light of philosophy which discloses the world of intellectual truth; finally, this light is guided by the light of divine wisdom which discloses the world of saving truth.\n\nSaint Thomas Aquinas's aesthetic is probably the most famous and influential theory among medieval authors, having been the subject of much scrutiny in the wake of the neo-Scholastic revival of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and even having received the approbation of the celebrated Modernist writer, James Joyce. Thomas, like many other medievals, never gives a systematic account of beauty itself, but several scholars have conventionally arranged his thought—though not always with uniform conclusions—using relevant observations spanning the entire corpus of his work. While Aquinas's theory follows generally the model of Aristotle, he develops a singular aesthetics which incorporates elements unique to his thought. Umberto Eco's \"The Aesthetics of Thomas Aquinas\" identifies the three main characteristics of beauty in Aquinas's philosophy: \"integritas sive perfectio\", \"consonantia sive debita proportio\", and \"claritas sive splendor formae\". While Aristotle likewise identifies the first two characteristics, St. Thomas conceives of the third as an appropriation from principles developed by neo-Platonic and Augustinian thinkers. With the shift from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, art likewise changed its focus, as much in its content as in its mode of expression.\n\nAddison's \"Essays on the Imagination\" contributed to the \"Spectator\", though they belong to popular literature, contain the germ of scientific analysis in the statement that the pleasures of imagination (which arise originally from sight) fall into two classes — (1) primary pleasures, which entirely proceed from objects before our eyes; and (2) secondary pleasures, flowing from the ideas of visible objects. The latter are greatly extended by the addition of the proper enjoyment of resemblance, which is at the basis of all mimicry and wit. Addison recognizes, too, to some extent, the influence of association upon our aesthetic preferences.\n\nShaftesbury is the first of the intuitional writers on beauty. In his \"Characteristics\" the beautiful and the good are combined in one ideal conception, much as with Plato. Matter in itself is ugly. The order of the world, wherein all beauty really resides, is a spiritual principle, all motion and life being the product of spirit. The principle of beauty is perceived not with the outer sense, but with an internal or moral sense which apprehends the good as well. This perception yields the only true delight, namely, spiritual enjoyment.\n\nFrancis Hutcheson, in his \"System of Moral Philosophy\", though he adopts many of Shaftesbury's ideas, distinctly disclaims any independent self-existing beauty in objects. \"All beauty\", he says, \"is relative to the sense of some mind perceiving it.\" One cause of beauty is to be found not in a simple sensation such as colour or tone, but in a certain order among the parts, or \"uniformity amidst variety\". The faculty by which this principle is discerned is an internal sense which is defined as \"a passive power of receiving ideas of beauty from all objects in which there is uniformity in variety\". This inner sense resembles the external senses in the immediateness of the pleasure which its activity brings, and further in the necessity of its impressions: a beautiful thing being always, whether we will or no, beautiful. He distinguishes two kinds of beauty, absolute or original, and relative or comparative. The latter is discerned in an object which is regarded as an imitation or semblance of another. He distinctly states that \"an exact imitation may still be beautiful though the original were entirely devoid of it.\" He seeks to prove the universality of this sense of beauty, by showing that all men, in proportion to the enlargement of their intellectual capacity, are more delighted with uniformity than the opposite.\n\nPerhaps the first German philosopher who developed an independent aesthetic theory was Baumgarten. In his best-known work \"Aesthetica\", he complemented the Leibniz-Wolffian theory of knowledge by adding to the clear scientific or \"logical\" knowledge of the understanding the knowledge of the senses, to which he gave the name \"aesthetic\". It is for this reason that Baumgarten is said to have \"coined\" the term \"aesthetics\". Beauty to him corresponds to perfect sense-knowledge. Baumgarten reduces taste to an intellectual act and ignores the element of feeling. To him, nature is the highest embodiment of beauty, and thus art must seek its supreme function in the strictest possible imitation of nature.\n\nBurke's speculations, in his \"Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful\", illustrate the tendency of English writers to treat the problem as a psychological one and to introduce physiological considerations. He finds the elements of beauty to be:-- (1) smallness; (2) smoothness; (3) gradual variation of direction in gentle curves; (4) delicacy, or the appearance of fragility; (5) brightness, purity and softness of colour. The sublime is rather crudely resolved into astonishment, which he thinks always retains an element of terror. Thus \"infinity has a tendency to fill the mind with a delightful horror.\" Burke seeks what he calls \"efficient causes\" for these aesthetic impressions in certain affections of the nerves of sight analogous to those of other senses, namely, the soothing effect of a relaxation of the nerve fibres. The arbitrariness and narrowness of this theory cannot well escape the reader's attention.\n\nKant's theory of aesthetic judgments remains a highly debated aesthetic theory until today. It is important to note that Kant uses the term \"aesthetics\" (\"Ästhetik\") to refer to any sensual experience. The work most crucial to aesthetics as a strand of philosophy is the first half of his Critique of the Power of Judgment, the \"Critique of the Aesthetic Power of Judgment\". It is subdivided in two main parts - the \"Analytic of the Beautiful\" and the \"Analytic of the Sublime\", but also deals with the experience of fine art.\n\nFor Kant, beauty does not reside \"inside\" an object, but is defined as the pleasure that stems from the ″free play″ of imagination and understanding inspired by the object — which as a result we will call beautiful. Such pleasure is more than mere agreeableness, since it must be disinterested and free — that is to say independent from the object's ability to serve as an end to a mean. Even though the feeling of beauty is subjective, Kant goes beyond the notion of ″beauty is in the eye of the beholder″: If something is beautiful to me, I also think that it should be so for everybody else, even though I cannot prove beauty to anyone. Kant also insists that the aesthetic judgment is always, an \"individual\" i.e. a singular one, of the form \"\"This\" object (e.g. rose) is beautiful.\" He denies that we can reach a valid universal aesthetic judgment of the form \"All objects possessing such and such qualities are beautiful.\" (A judgment of this form would be logical, not aesthetic.) Nature, in Kant's aesthetics, is the primary example for beauty, ranking as a source of aesthetic pleasure above art, which he only considers in the last parts of the third \"Critique of the Aesthetic Judgment\". It is in these last paragraphs where he connects to his earlier works when he argues that the highest significance of beauty is to symbolize moral good; going in this regard even further than Ruskin.\n\nSchelling is the first thinker to attempt a Philosophy of Art. He develops this as the third part of his system of transcendental idealism following theoretic and practical philosophy. (See also Schelling's \"Werke\", Bd. v., and J. Watson, Schelling's \"Transcendental Idealism\", ch. vii., Chicago, 1882.) According to Schelling a new philosophical significance is given to art by the doctrine that the identity of subject and object — which is half disguised in ordinary perception and volition — is only clearly seen in artistic perception. The perfect perception of its real self by intelligence in the work of art is accompanied by a feeling of infinite satisfaction. Art in thus effecting a revelation of the absolute seems to attain a dignity not merely above that of nature but above that of philosophy itself. Schelling throws but little light on the concrete forms of beauty. His classification of the arts, based on his antithesis of object and subject, is a curiosity in intricate arrangement. He applies his conception in a suggestive way to classical tragedy.\n\nIn Hegel's system of philosophy art is viewed as the first stage of the absolute spirit. (See also \"Werke\", Bd. x., and Bosanquet's \"Introduction to Hegel's Philosophy of Fine Art\".) In this stage the absolute is immediately present to sense-perception, an idea which shows the writer's complete rupture with Kant's doctrine of the \"subjectivity\" of beauty. The beautiful is defined as the ideal showing itself to sense or through a sensuous medium. It is said to have its life in show or semblance (Schein) and so differs from the true, which is not really sensuous, but the universal idea contained in sense for thought. The form of the beautiful is unity of the manifold. The notion (Begriff) gives necessity in mutual dependence of parts (unity), while the reality demands the semblance (Schein) of liberty in the parts. He discusses very fully the beauty of nature as immediate unity of notion and reality, and lays great emphasis on the beauty of organic life. But it is in art that, like Schelling, Hegel finds the highest revelation of the beautiful. Art makes up for the deficiencies of natural beauty by bringing the idea into clearer light, by showing the external world in its life and spiritual animation. The several species of art in the ancient and modern worlds depend on the various combinations of matter and form. He classifies the individual arts according to this same principle of the relative supremacy of form and matter, the lowest being architecture, the highest, poetry.\n\nCurious developments of the Hegelian conception are to be found in the dialectical treatment of beauty in its relation to the ugly, the sublime, etc., by Hegel's disciples, e.g. C. H. Weisse and J. K. F. Rosenkranz. The most important product of the Hegelian School is the elaborate system of aesthetics published by F. T. Vischer (\"Esthetik\", 3 Theile, 1846—1834). It illustrates the difficulties of the Hegelian thought and terminology; yet in dealing with art it is full of knowledge and highly suggestive.\n\nThe aesthetic problem is also treated by two other philosophers whose thought set out from certain tendencies in Kant's system, namely Schopenhauer and Herbart. Schopenhauer (see also \"The World as Will and Idea\", translated by R. B. Haldane, esp. vol. i. pp. 219–346), abandoning also Kant's doctrine of the subjectivity of beauty, found in aesthetic contemplation the perfect emancipation of intellect from will. In this contemplation the mind is filled with pure intellectual forms, the \"Platonic Ideas\" as he calls them, which are objectifications of the will at a certain grade of completeness of representation. He exalts the state of artistic contemplation as the one in which, as pure intellect set free from will, the misery of existence is surmounted and something of blissful ecstasy attained. He holds that all things are in some degree beautiful, ugliness being viewed as merely imperfect manifestation or objectification of will. In this way the beauty of nature, somewhat slighted by Schelling and Hegel, is rehabilitated.\n\nJ. F. Herbart struck out another way of escaping from Kant's idea of a purely subjective beauty (Kerbach's edition of \"Werke\", Bd. ii. pp. 339 et seq.; Bd. iv. pp. 105 et seq., and Bd. ix. pp. 92 et seq..) He did, indeed, adopt Kant's view of the aesthetic Judgment as singular (\"individual\"); though he secures a certain degree of logical universality for it by emphasizing the point that the predicate (beauty) is permanently true of the same aesthetic object. At the same time, by referring the beauty of concrete objects to certain aesthetic relations, he virtually accepted the possibility of universal aesthetic judgments (compare above). Since he thus reduces beauty to abstract relations he is known as a formalist, and the founder of the formalistic school in aesthetics. He sets out with the idea that only relations please — in the Kantian sense of producing pleasure devoid of desire; and his aim is to determine the \"aesthetic elementary relations\", or the simplest relations which produce this pleasure. These include those of will, so that, as he admits, ethical judgments are in a manner brought under an aesthetic form. His typical example of aesthetic relations of objects of sense-perception is that of harmony between tones. The science of thorough-bass has, he thinks, done for music what should be done also for other departments of aesthetic experience. This doctrine of elementary relations is brought into connexion with the author's psychological doctrine of presentations with their tendencies to mutual inhibition and to fusion, and of the varying feeling-tones to which these processes give rise. This mode of treating the problem of beauty and aesthetic perception has been greatly developed and worked up into a comrlete system of aesthetics by one of Herbart's disciples, Robert Zimmermann (\"Asthetik\", 1838).\n\nLessing, in his \"Laocoon\" and elsewhere, sought to deduce the special function of an art from a consideration of the means at its disposal. He took pains to define the boundaries of poetry and upon the ends and appliances of art. Among these his distinction between arts which employ the coexistent in space and those which employ the successive (as poetry and music) is of lasting value. In his dramatic criticisms he similarly endeavoured to develop clear general principles on such points as poetic truth, improving upon Aristotle, on whose teaching he mainly relies.\n\nGoethe wrote several tracts on aesthetic topics, as well as many aphorisms. He attempted to mediate between the claims of ideal beauty, as taught by J. J. Winckelmann, and the aims of dualization. Schiller discusses, in a number of disconnected essays and letters some of the main questions in the philosophy of art. He looks at art from the side of culture and the forces of human nature, and finds in an aesthetically cultivated soul the reconciliation of the sensual and rational. His letters on aesthetic education (\"Uber die asthetische Erziehung des Menschen\", trans. by J. Weiss, Boston, 1845) are valuable, bringing out among other points the connexion between aesthetic activity and the universal impulse to play (Spieltrieb). Schiller's thoughts on aesthetic subjects are pervaded with the spirit of Kant's philosophy.\n\nAnother example of this kind of reflective discussion of art by literary men is afforded us in the Vorschule der Asthetik of Jean Paul Richter. This is a rather ambitious discussion of the sublime and ludicrous, which, however, contains much valuable matter on the nature of humour in romantic poetry. Among other writers who reflect more or less philosophically on the problems to which modern poetry gives rise are Wilhelm von Humboldt, the two Schlegels (August and Friedrich) and Gervinus.\n\nA word may be said in conclusion on the attempts of German savants to apply a knowledge of physiological conditions to the investigation of the sensuous elements of aesthetic effect, as well as to introduce into the study of the simpler aesthetic forms the methods of natural science. The classic work of Helmholtz on \"Sensations of Tone\" is a highly musical composition on physics and physiology. The endeavour to determine with a like degree of precision the physiological conditions of the pleasurable effects of colours and their combinations by E. W. Brucke, Ewald Hering and more recent investigators, has so far failed to realize the desideratum laid down by Herbart, that there should be a theory of colour-relations equal in completeness and exactness to that of tone-relations. The experimental inquiry into simple aesthetically pleasing forms was begun by G. T. Fechner in seeking to test the soundness of Adolf Zeising's hypothesis that the most pleasing proportion in dividing a line, say the vertical part of a cross, is the \"golden section\", where the smaller division is to the larger as the latter to the sum. He describes in his work on \"Experimental Aesthetics\" (\"Auf experimentalen Asthetik\") a series of experiments carried out on a large number of persons, bearing on this point, the results of which he considers to be in favour of Zeising's hypothesis.\n\nIn France aesthetic speculation grew out of the discussion by poets and critics on the relation of modern art; and Boileau in the 17th century, the development of the dispute between the \"ancients\" and the \"moderns\" at the end of the 17th century by B. le Bouvier de Fontenelle and Charles Perrault, and the continuation of the discussion as to the aims of poetry and of art generally in the 18th century by Voltaire, Bayle, Diderot and others, not only offer to the modern theorists valuable material in the shape of a record by experts of their aesthetic experience, but disclose glimpses of important aesthetic principles. Yves Marie André's \"Essay on Beauty\" was an exploration of visual, musical, moral, and intellectual beauty. A more systematic examination of the several arts (corresponding to that of Lessing) is to be found in the \"Cours de belles lettres\" of Charles Batteux (1765), in which the meaning and value of the imitation of nature by art are further elucidated, and the arts are classified (as by Lessing) according as they employ the forms of space or those of time.\n\nThe beginning of a more scientific investigation of beauty in general is connected with the name of Pere Buffier (see \"First Truths\"), form, and illustrates his theory by the human face. A beautiful face is at once the most common and most rare among members of the species. This seems to be a clumsy way of saying that it is a clear expression of the typical form of the species.\n\nThis idea of typical beauty (which was adopted by Reynolds) has been worked out more recently by Hippolyte Taine. In his work, \"The Ideal in Art\" (trans. by I. Durand), he proceeds in the manner of a botanist to determine a scale of characters in the physical and moral man. The degree of the universality or importance of a character, and of its beneficence or adaptation to the ends of life, determine the measure of its aesthetic value, and render the work of art, which seeks to represent it in its purity, an ideal work.\n\nThe only elaborated systems of aesthetics in French literature are those constructed by the \"spiritualistes\", the philosophic writers who under the influence of German thinkers effected a reaction against the crude sensationalism of the 18th century. They aim at elucidating the higher and spiritual element in aesthetic impressions, appearing to ignore any capability in the sensuous material of affording a true aesthetic delight. Victor Cousin and Jean Charles Leveque are the principal writers of this school. The latter developed an elaborate system of the subject (\"La Science du beau\"). All beauty is regarded as spiritual in its nature. The several beautiful characters of an organic body — of which the principal are magnitude, unity and variety of parts, intensity of colour, grace or flexibility, and correspondence to environment — may be brought under the conception of the ideal grandeur and order of the species. These are perceived by reason to be the manifestations of an invisible vital force. Similarly the beauties of inorganic nature are to be viewed as the grand and orderly displays of an immaterial physical force. Thus all beauty is in its objective essence either spirit or unconscious force acting with fulness and in order.\n\nThere is nothing answering to the German conception of a system of aesthetics in English literature. The inquiries of English thinkers have been directed for the most part to such modest problems as the psychological process by which we perceive the beautiful — discussions which are apt to be regarded by German historians as devoid of real philosophical value. The writers may be conveniently arranged in two divisions, answering to the two opposed directions of English thought: (1) the Intuitionalists, those who recognize the existence of an objective beauty which is a simple unanalysable attribute or principle of things; and (2) the Analytical theorists, those who follow the analytical and psychological method, concerning themselves with the sentiment of beauty as a complex growth out of simpler elements.\n\nIn his \"Essays on the Intellectual Powers\" (viii. \"Of Taste\") Thomas Reid applies his principle of common sense to the problem of beauty saying that objects of beauty agree not only in producing a certain agreeable emotion, but in the excitation along with this emotion of a belief that they possess some perfection or excellence, that beauty exists in the objects independently of our minds. His theory of beauty is severely spiritual. All beauty resides primarily in the faculties of the mind, intellectual and moral. The beauty which is spread over the face of visible nature is an emanation from this spiritual beauty, and is beauty because it symbolizes and expresses the latter. Thus the beauty of a plant resides in its perfect adaptation to its end, a perfection which is an expression of the wisdom of its Creator.\n\nIn his \"Lectures on Metaphysics\" Sir W. Hamilton gives a short account of the sentiments of taste, which (with a superficial resemblance to Kant) he regards as subserving both the subsidiary and the elaborative faculties in cognition, that is, the imagination and the understanding. The activity of the former corresponds to the element of variety in a beautiful object, that of the latter with its unity. He explicitly excludes all other kinds of pleasure, such as the sensuous, from the proper gratification of beauty. He denies that the attribute of beauty belongs to fitness.\n\nJohn Ruskin's well-known speculations on the nature of beauty in \"Modern Painters\" (\"Of ideas of beauty\"), though sadly wanting in scientific precision, have a certain value in the history of divine attributes. Its true nature is appreciated by the theoretic faculty which is concerned in the moral conception and appreciation of ideas of beauty, and must be distinguished from the imaginative or artistic faculty, which is employed in regarding in a certain way and combining the ideas received from external nature. He distinguishes between typical and vital beauty. The former is the external quality of bodies which typifies some divine attribute. The latter consists in \"the appearance of felicitous fulfilment of function in living things\". The forms of typical beauty are:-- (1) infinity, the type of the divine incomprehensibility; (2) unity, the type of the divine comprehensiveness; (3) repose, the type of the divine permanence; (4) symmetry, the type of the divine justice; (5) purity, the type of the divine energy; and (6) moderation, the type of government by law. Vital beauty, again, is regarded as relative when the degree of exaltation of the function is estimated, or generic if only the degree of conformity of an individual to the appointed functions of the species is taken into account. Ruskin's writings illustrate the extreme tendency to identify aesthetic with moral perception.\n\nIn the \"Elements of Criticism\" of Home (Lord Kames) another attempt is made to resolve the pleasure of beauty into its elements. Beauty and ugliness are simply the pleasant and he appears to admit no general characteristic of beautiful objects beyond this power of yielding pleasure. Like Hutcheson, he divides beauty into intrinsic and relative, but understands by the latter the appearance of fitness and utility, which is excluded from the beautiful by Hutcheson.\n\nPassing by the name of Sir Joshua Reynolds, whose theory of beauty closely resembles that of Pere Buffier, we come to the articulations of another artist and painter, William Hogarth. He discusses, in his \"Analysis of Beauty\", all the elements of visual beauty. He finds in this the following elements:-- (1) fitness of the parts to some design; (2) variety in as many ways as possible; (3) uniformity, regularity or symmetry, which is only beautiful when it helps to preserve the character of fitness; (4) simplicity or distinctness, which gives pleasure not in itself, but through its enabling the eye to enjoy variety with ease; (5) intricacy, which provides employment for our active energies, leading the eye \"a wanton kind of chase\"; (6) quantity or magnitude, which draws our attention and produces admiration and awe. The beauty of proportion he resolves into the needs of fitness. Hogarth applies these principles to the determination of the degrees of beauty in lines, figures and groups of forms. Among lines he singles out for special honour the serpentine (formed by drawing a line once round from the base to the apex of a long slender cone).\n\nAlison, in his well-known \"Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste\", proceeds by a method exactly the opposite to that of Hogarth and Burke. He seeks to analyse the mental process then finds that this consists in a peculiar operation of the imagination, namely, the flow of a train of ideas through the mind, which ideas always correspond to some simple affection or emotion (e.g. cheerfulness, sadness, awe) awakened by the object. He thus makes association the sole source of aesthetic delight, and denies the existence of a primary source in sensations themselves. He illustrates the working of the principle of association at great length, and with much skill; yet his attempt to make it the unique source of aesthetic pleasure fails completely. Francis Jeffrey's \"Essays on Beauty\" (in the Edinburgh Review, and Encyclopædia Britannica, 8th edition) are little more than a modification of Alison's theory. \"Philosophical Essays\" consists in pointing out the unwarranted assumption lurking in the doctrine of a single quality running through all varieties of beautiful object. He seeks to show how the successive changes in the meaning of the term \"beautiful\" have arisen. He suggests that it originally connoted the pleasure of colour. The value of his discussion resides more in the criticism of his predecessors than in the contribution of new ideas. His conception of the sublime, suggested by the etymology of the word, emphasizes the element of height in objects.\n\nOf the association psychologists James Mill did little more towards the analysis of the sentiments of beauty than re-state Alison's doctrine. Alexander Bain, in his treatise, \"The Emotions and the Will\" (\"Aesthetic Emotions\"), carries this examination considerably further. He seeks to differentiate aesthetic from other varieties of pleasurable emotion by three characteristics:-- (1) their freedom from life-serving uses, being gratifications sought for their own sakes; (2) their purity from all disagreeable concomitants; (3) their eminently sympathetic or shareable nature. He takes a comprehensive view of the constituents of aesthetic enjoyment, including the pleasures of sensation and of its revived or its \"ideal\" form; of revived emotional states; and lastly the satisfaction of those wide-ranging susceptibilities which we call the love of novelty, of contrast and of harmony. The effect of sublimity is connected with the manifestation of superior power in its highest degrees, which manifestation excites a sympathetic elation in the beholder. The ludicrous, again, is defined by Bain, improving on Aristotle and Hobbes, as the degradation of something possessing dignity in circumstances that excite no other strong emotion.\n\nHerbert Spencer, in his \"First Principles\", \"Principles of Psychology\" and \"Essays\", has given an interesting turn to the psychology of aesthetics by the application of his doctrine of evolution. Adopting Schiller's idea of a connexion between aesthetic activity and play, he seeks to make it the starting-point in tracing the evolution of aesthetic activity. Play is defined as the outcome of the superfluous energies of the organism: as the activity of organs and faculties which, owing to a prolonged period of inactivity, have become specially ready to discharge their function, and as a consequence vent themselves in simulated actions. Aesthetic activities supply a similar mode of self-relieving discharge to the higher organs of perception and emotion; and they further agree with play in not directly subserving any processes conducive to life; in being gratifications sought for their own sake only. Spencer seeks to construct a hierarchy of aesthetic pleasures according to the degree of complexity of the faculty exercised: from those of sensation up to the revived emotional experiences which constitute the aesthetic sentiment proper. Among the more vaguely revived emotions Spencer includes more permanent feelings of the race transmitted by heredity; as when he refers the deep and indefinable emotion excited by music to associations with vocal tones expressive of feeling built up during the history of our species. This biological treatment of aesthetic activity has had a wide influence, some e.g. Grant Allen being content to develop his evolutional method. Yet, as suggested above, his theory is now recognized as taking us only a little way towards an adequate understanding of our aesthetic experience.\n\nAny aesthetic doctrines that guided the production and interpretation of prehistoric art are mostly unknown. An indirect concern with aesthetics can be inferred from ancient art in many early civilizations, including Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, Greece, China, the Etruscans, Rome, India, the Celtic peoples, and the Maya, as each of them developed a unique and characteristic style in its art.\n\nWestern aesthetics usually refers to Greek philosophers as the earliest source of formal aesthetic considerations. Plato believed in beauty as a \"form\" in which beautiful objects partake and which causes them to be beautiful. He felt that beautiful objects incorporated proportion, harmony, and unity among their parts. Similarly, in the \"Metaphysics\", Aristotle found that the universal elements of beauty were order, symmetry, and definiteness.\n\nFrom the late 17th to the early 20th century Western aesthetics underwent a slow revolution into what is often called modernism. German and British thinkers emphasized beauty as the key component of art and of the aesthetic experience, and saw art as necessarily aiming at absolute beauty.\n\nFor Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten aesthetics is the science of the sense experiences, a younger sister of logic, and beauty is thus the most perfect kind of knowledge that sense experience can have. For Immanuel Kant the aesthetic experience of beauty is a judgment of a subjective but similar human truth, since all people should agree that \"this rose is beautiful\" if it in fact is. However, beauty cannot be reduced to any more basic set of features. For Friedrich Schiller aesthetic appreciation of beauty is the most perfect reconciliation of the sensual and rational parts of human nature.\n\nFor Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, the philosophy of art is the \"organon\" of philosophy concerning the relation between man and nature. So aesthetics began now to be the name for the \"philosophy of art\". Friedrich von Schlegel, August Wilhelm Schlegel, Friedrich Schleiermacher and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel also gave lectures on aesthetics as \"philosophy of art\" after 1800.\n\nFor Hegel, all culture is a matter of \"absolute spirit\" coming to be manifest to itself, stage by stage, changing to a perfection that only philosophy can approach. Art is the first stage in which the absolute spirit is manifest immediately to sense-perception, and is thus an objective rather than subjective revelation of beauty.\n\nFor Arthur Schopenhauer aesthetic contemplation of beauty is the most free that the pure intellect can be from the dictates of will; here we contemplate perfection of form without any kind of worldly agenda, and thus any intrusion of utility or politics would ruin the point of the beauty. It is thus for Schopenhauer one way to fight the suffering.\n\nThe British were largely divided into intuitionist and analytic camps. The intuitionists believed that aesthetic experience was disclosed by a single mental faculty of some kind. For Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury this was identical to the moral sense, beauty just is the sensory version of moral goodness. For Ludwig Wittgenstein aesthetics consisted in the description of a whole culture which is a linguistic impossibility. Hence his viewpoint can be paraphrased as \"That which constitutes aesthetics lies outside the realm of the language game\".\nFor Oscar Wilde, the contemplation of beauty for beauty's sake (augmented by John Ruskin's search for moral grounding) was more than the foundation for much of his literary career; he once stated, \"Aestheticism is a search after the signs of the beautiful. It is the science of the beautiful through which men seek the correlation of the arts. It is, to speak more exactly, the search after the secret of life.\".\n\nWilde toured the United States in 1882 spreading the idea of Aesthetics in a speech called \"The English Renaissance\". In his speech he proposed that Beauty and Aesthetics were \"not languid but energetic. By beautifying the outward aspects of life, one would beautify the inner ones.\" The English Renaissance was, he said, \"like the Italian Renaissance before it, a sort of rebirth of the spirit of man\".\n\nFor Francis Hutcheson beauty is disclosed by an inner mental sense, but is a subjective fact rather than an objective one. Analytic theorists like Henry Home, Lord Kames, William Hogarth, and Edmund Burke hoped to reduce beauty to some list of attributes. Hogarth, for example, thinks that beauty consists of (1) fitness of the parts to some design; (2) variety in as many ways as possible; (3) uniformity, regularity or symmetry, which is only beautiful when it helps to preserve the character of fitness; (4) simplicity or distinctness, which gives pleasure not in itself, but through its enabling the eye to enjoy variety with ease; (5) intricacy, which provides employment for our active energies, leading the eye on \"a wanton kind of chase\"; and (6) quantity or magnitude, which draws our attention and produces admiration and awe. Later analytic aestheticians strove to link beauty to some scientific theory of psychology (such as James Mill) or biology (such as Herbert Spencer).\n\nThe Indian aesthetics tradition traces to the Vedic era texts of Hinduism. The Aitareya Brahmana (~1000 BCE) in section 6.27, for example, states the arts are a refinement of the self (\"atma-samskrti\"). The oldest surviving complete Sanskrit manuscript that discusses a theory of aesthetics is of \"Natya Shastra\", estimated to have been complete between 200 BCE and 200 CE. This theory is called \"rasa\" in the text. \"Rasa\" is an ancient concept in Indian arts about the aesthetic flavor of any visual, literary or musical work, that evokes an emotion or feeling in the reader or audience, but that cannot be described. According to the \"Natya shastra\", the goal of arts is to empower aesthetic experience, deliver emotional \"rasa\" (juice, taste). In many cases, art aims to produce repose and relief for those exhausted with labor, or distraught with grief, or laden with misery, or struck by austere times. Yet entertainment is an effect, but not the primary goal of arts according to \"Natya shastra\". The primary goal is to create \"rasa\" so as to lift and transport the spectators, unto the expression of ultimate reality and transcendent values.\n\nThe most complete exposition of aesthetics in drama, songs and other performance arts is found in the works of the Kashmiri Shaivite-Hindu philosopher Abhinavagupta (c. 1000 CE). Abhinavagupta's analysis of \"Natyasastra\" is notable for its extensive discussion of aesthetic and ontological questions.\n\nThe concept of rasa is fundamental to many forms of Indian arts including dance, music, theatre, painting, sculpture, and literature, the interpretation and implementation of a particular rasa differs between different styles and schools. In Indian classical music, each \"raga\" is an inspired creation for a specific mood, where the musician or ensemble creates the \"rasa\" in the listener.\n\nIn the aesthetic theories of Indian poetics, its ancient scholars discuss both what is stated and how it is stated (words, grammar, rhythm), suggesting that the meaning of the text and the experience of \"rasa\" are both important. Among the most celebrated in Hindu traditions on the theory of poetics and literary works, are 5th-century Bhartrhari and the 9th-century Anandavardhana, but the theoretical tradition on integrating \"rasa\" into literary artworks likely goes back to a more ancient period. This is generally discussed under the Indian concepts of \"Dhvani\", \"Sabdatattva\" and \"Sphota\".\n\nIn the Indian theories on sculpture and architecture (\"Shilpa Shastras\"), the \"rasa\" theories, in part, drive the forms, shapes, arrangements and expressions in images and structures.\n\nChinese art has a long history of varied styles and emphases. Confucius emphasized the role of the arts and humanities (especially music and poetry) in broadening human nature and aiding \"li\" (etiquette, the rites) in bringing us back to what is essential about humanity. His opponent Mozi, however, argued that music and fine arts were classist and wasteful, benefiting the rich over the poor.\n\nBy the 4th century AD artists had started debating in writing over the proper goals of art as well. Gu Kaizhi has left three surviving books on the theory of painting. Several later artists or scholars both created art and wrote about the creation of it. Religious and philosophical influences on art were common (and diverse) but never universal.\n\nModern Chinese aesthetic theory took shape during the modernization of China from Empire to republic in early 20th century. Thus thinkers like Kant, Hegel, Marx and Heidegger have all been incorporated into contemporary Chinese aesthetic theory, through philosophers like Li Zehou.\n\nAfrican art is the cultural expression of a vast and rich continent. It is the product of millennia of changes, migrations, international and intercontinental trade, diplomacy and cultural norms. Within the scholarship surrounding African art, there is some question in using the word \"art\" to describe it. Malidoma and Sonbofu Somé, cultural emissaries of the Dagara of Burkina Faso hold that within their culture the closest word for art is simply the word \"sacred\". Kongo nkisi power objects illustrate this point. They are objects traded on the contemporary art market on aesthetic value, however their purpose was to serve in rituals of personal and community healing. Consideration is due, when viewing African cultural product, in understanding the primary function of these objects held within the cultures themselves.\n\nThere is a wonderful interplay between practicality and aesthetic in African material culture. Consider the Akan stool, Yoruba adire cloth and combs, or Gio spoons. Here you have an example of the African genius in enlivening the most mundane object into an aesthetic presence. Sculpture and performance art are prominent, and abstract and partially abstracted forms are valued, and were valued long before influence from the Western tradition began in earnest. The Nok culture is testimony to this. The mosque of Timbuktu shows that specific areas of Africa developed unique aesthetics.\n\nArab art has the context of Islam, started in the 7th century, is sometimes referred to as Islamic art, although many Arab artists throughout time have not been Muslim. The term \"Islamic\" refers not only to the religion, but to any form of art created by people in an Islamic culture or in an Islamic context, whether the artist is Islamic or not. Not all Muslims are in agreement on the use of art in religious observance, the proper place of art in society, or the relation between secular art and the demands placed on the secular world to conform to religious precepts. Islamic art frequently adopts secular elements and elements that are frowned upon, if not forbidden, by some Islamic theologians. Although the often cited opposition in Islam to the depiction of human and animal forms holds true for religious art and architecture, in the secular sphere, such representations have flourished in nearly all Islamic cultures.\n\nThe Islamic resistance to the representation of living beings ultimately stems from the belief that the creation of living forms is unique to God, and it is for this reason that the role of images and image makers has been controversial. The strongest statements on the subject of figural depiction are made in the Hadith (Traditions of the Prophet), where painters are challenged to \"breathe life\" into their creations and threatened with punishment on the Day of Judgment. The Qur'an is less specific but condemns idolatry and uses the Arabic term musawwir (\"maker of forms,\" or artist) as an epithet for God. Partially as a result of this religious sentiment, figures in painting were often stylized and, in some cases, the destruction of figurative artworks occurred. Iconoclasm was previously known in the Byzantine period and aniconicism was a feature of the Judaic world, thus placing the Islamic objection to figurative representations within a larger context. As ornament, however, figures were largely devoid of any larger significance and perhaps therefore posed less challenge.\n\nHuman portrayals can be found in early Islamic cultures with varying degrees of acceptance by religious authorities. Human representation for the purpose of worship is uniformly considered idolatry as forbidden in \"Sharia\" law.\n\nArabic is written from right to left, like other Semitic scripts, and consists of 17 characters, which, with the addition of dots placed above or below certain of them, provide the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet. Short vowels are not included in the alphabet, being indicated by signs placed above or below the consonant or long vowel that they follow. Certain characters may be joined to their neighbours, others to the preceding one only, and others to the succeeding one only. The written letters undergo a slight external change according to their position within a word. When they stand alone or occur at the end of a word, they ordinarily terminate in a bold stroke; when they appear in the middle of a word, they are ordinarily joined to the letter following by a small, upward curved stroke. With the exception of six letters, which can be joined only to the preceding ones, the initial and medial letters are much abbreviated, while the final form consists of the initial form with a triumphant flourish. The essential part of the characters, however, remains unchanged.\n\n\n (See pp. 285–289.)\n"}

{"id": "2379091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2379091", "title": "Kamen Rider Series", "text": "Kamen Rider Series\n\nThe is a metaseries of manga and tokusatsu television programs and films created by manga artist Shotaro Ishinomori. The \"Kamen Rider\" media generally features a motorcycle-riding superhero with an insect motif who fights supervillains, often known as . The franchise began in 1971 with the \"Kamen Rider\" television series, which followed college student Takeshi Hongo and his quest to defeat the world-conquering Shocker organization. Its popularity has grown; the original series spawned television and film sequels and launched the Second Kaiju Boom (also known as the Henshin Boom) on Japanese television during the early 1970s, impacting the superhero and action-adventure genres in Japan.\n\nProduced by and designed by Shotaro Ishinomori (creator of \"Cyborg 009\"), \"Kamen Rider\" premiered on April 3, 1971 initially intended as an adaptation of Ishinomori's \"Skull Man\". He and Hirayama redesigned the main character to resemble a grasshopper. The hero Takeshi Hongo, played by actor and stuntman Hiroshi Fujioka, was described as a (cyborg). During the filming of episode 10, Fujioka was thrown from his motorcycle during a stunt and broke both legs. His character was phased out until the introduction of another transformed human, Hayato Ichimonji (played by Takeshi Sasaki) was introduced in episode 14. The return of Fujioka and his character, Hongo, in episode 53 united the two actors and Kamen Riders 1 and 2 appeared in every show of the first half of the Shōwa series. The series from April 1971 to January 1976 (\"Kamen Rider\", \"V3\", \"X\", \"Amazon\", \"Stronger\") included a recurring mentor, Tobei Tachibana.\n\nAfter a four-year hiatus following the finale of \"Kamen Rider Stronger\", the series returned to broadcast television in October 1979 for two years with \"The New Kamen Rider\" (featuring Skyrider) and \"Kamen Rider Super-1\". In these shows, Tachibana was replaced by a similar character named . The annual new shows ended briefly during the 1980s, punctuated by the 1984 Kamen Rider ZX special \"Birth of the 10th! Kamen Riders All Together!!\" (Hirayama's last project for the franchise).\n\n\"Kamen Rider Black\" premiered in 1987, the first series not hinting at a relationship to its predecessors. \"Black\" was the first show in the franchise with a direct sequel: \"Kamen Rider Black RX\", the basis of Saban's Americanized \"Masked Rider\". In \"RX\" finale, the ten previous Riders returned to help Black RX defeat the Crisis Empire. \"Kamen Rider Black RX\" was the final show produced during the Shōwa era, with the franchise resuming production by the end of the 20th century. A manga of \"Kamen Rider Black\" was a novelization and reimagination of the \"Black\"-\"RX\" series' continuity. Absent from television during the 1990s, the franchise was kept alive by stage shows, musical CDs, and the \"\", \"ZO\", and \"J\" films.\n\nToei announced a new project, \"Kamen Rider Kuuga\", in May 1999. \"Kuuga\" was part of Ishinomori's 1997 Kamen Rider revival in preparation for its 30th anniversary, but he died before the shows materialized. During the summer of 1999, Kuuga was promoted in magazine advertisements and TV commercials. On January 30, 2000, \"Kamen Rider Kuuga\" premiered with newcomer Joe Odagiri. \n\nIn 2005, \"Kamen Rider The First\" was produced. Written by Toshiki Inoue, the film reimagines the manga and original television series and characters from the original series had their storylines altered to fit the film's time span. Masaya Kikawada played Takeshi Hongo/Kamen Rider 1 and Hassei Takano (previously Miyuki Tezuka/Kamen Rider Raia in \"Kamen Rider Ryuki\") was Hayato Ichimonji/Kamen Rider 2. This was followed in 2007 by \"Kamen Rider The Next\", an adaptation of \"Kamen Rider V3\" starring Kazuki Kato (previously Daisuke Kazama/Kamen Rider Drake in \"Kamen Rider Kabuto\") as Shiro Kazami/Kamen Rider V3 and with Kikawada and Takano reprising their roles.\n\nThe eighth series, \"Kamen Rider Den-O\", followed in 2007. Differing from past Kamen Rider series, it introduces a rider who is unsure of himself. The series has a large vehicle, the DenLiner: a bullet train which can travel through time. Although the series has only two riders (Den-O and Zeronos), they have multiple forms similar to Black RX, Kuuga, and Agito. Due to \"Den-O\" popularity, a second film crossover with the 2008 series \"Kamen Rider Kiva\" was released on April 12, 2008. The top film in its opening weekend, it grossed ¥730 million. In addition, Animate produced an OVA, \"Imagin Anime\", with SD versions of the Imagin. A third film, \"\" (with two new riders) was an epilogue for the series. According to Takeru Satoh, who played the lead character of Den-O in the television series and first three films, the series was successful because of its humor.\n\nThe 2009 series, \"Kamen Rider Decade\", commemorated the Heisei run's 10th anniversary. Japanese recording artist Gackt performed the series' opening theme, \"Journey through the Decade\", and the film's theme song (\"The Next Decade\") and jokingly expressed interest in playing a villain on the show. Also announced in 2009 was a fourth \"Den-O\" film (later revealed as the beginning of the Cho-Den-O Series of films), starting with \"\". In the March 2009 issue of \"Kindai\" magazine, \"Decade\" star Masahiro Inoue said that the series was scheduled for only 30 episodes.\n\nAdvertisements in May, June, and July 2009 promoted the debut of \"Kamen Rider W\", who first appeared at the 10th-anniversary Masked Rider Live event and was featured in \"\". The staff of \"W\" said that they planned to make 10 more years of Kamen Rider, differentiating subsequent series from the \"Kuuga\" through \"Decade\" period (including a new broadcast season from September of one year to about August of the next ). The hero of \"Kamen Rider W\" is the first Kamen Rider to transform from two people at once, and the series premiered on September 6, 2009. Continuing into 2010 with \"\", \"W\" ran from September 2009 to September 2010 instead of from January to January. The second, third, and fourth films of the Cho-Den-O series, collectively known as \"\", were also released in 2010. Late 2010 brought the series \"Kamen Rider OOO\" to television after \"W\"s finale, and 2011 observed the 40th anniversary of the franchise. Festivities that year included the Kamen Rider Girls idol group, the film \"\" (released on April 1) and \"OOO\"s successor, \"Kamen Rider Fourze\", which references the previous heroes in its characters' names and its plot. A crossover film, \"\", was released in 2012 featuring the heroes of all \"Kamen Rider\" and \"Super Sentai\" series to date.\n\nWith \"Fourze\"s run complete in 2012, \"Kamen Rider Wizard\" premiered; its protagonist was the first Kamen Rider to use magic. \"Wizard\" had the first homosexual character and cast member with Kaba-chan. \"\", a sequel to 2012's \"Super Hero Taisen\" with the revived Metal Hero Series characters from \"\" and other characters created by Shotaro Ishinomori appearing in \"\", was released in 2013.\n\nOn May 20, 2013, Toei filed for several trademarks on the phrase . \"Kamen Rider Gaim\" previewed on July 25, 2013, revealing a Sengoku period and fruit-themed motif to the series' multiple-rival Kamen Riders and Gen Urobuchi as the series' main writer. The third entry in the \"Super Hero Taisen\" film series, \"\", marked the 15th anniversary of the Heisei Kamen Rider era and revolved around a conflict between the 15 Heisei Riders and the 15 Showa Riders with Kamen Rider Fifteen, and a cameo appearance by the ToQgers and the Kyoryugers. It also marked the start of a yearly involving each year's Kamen Rider teaming up with the current Super Sentai team in a story tying into that year's entry in the \"Super Hero Taisen\" movie series. \"Gaim\" was followed in 2014 by \"Kamen Rider Drive\", the first Kamen Rider since Kamen Rider Black RX (who also used a motorcycle), to use a car instead of a motorcycle. The fourth \"Super Hero Taisen\", \"Super Hero Taisen GP\", marks \"Kamen Rider 3\" first live-action appearance after the \"Showa Kamen Rider\" manga. \"Kamen Rider Ghost\" was introduced in 2015. In 2016 the Kamen Rider Series celebrated its 45th anniversary, and Toei released the film \"Kamen Rider 1\" on March 26, 2016. \"Kamen Rider Ex-Aid\" was introduced in 2016 and was the first Rider series to have a character, Kiriya Kujo, portray the main Rider's motorcycle. A Movie War film known as \"\" was announced for December 10, 2016, featuring Bandai Namco Entertainment's original character created by Namco prior merging with Bandai in 2006, Pac-Man. Following up \"Ex-Aid's\" finale \"Kamen Rider Build\" premiered on September 3rd, 2017. The twentieth and last series of the Heisei era, \"Kamen Rider Zi-O,\" which commemorates the 20th anniversary of the Heisei era, premiered on September 2nd, 2018.\n\nThe following is a list of the 29 Kamen Rider Series and their broadcast years:\n\n\n\nDirect-to-video releases, films focusing on secondary riders and storylines, began appearing during the franchise's Heisei era. Hyper Battle Videos are episodes included with \"Televi-Kun\" magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1975–1976, the Tungstar Company in Taiwan produced a Super Riders series based on the Japanese version.\n\nIn 1995, Saban produced the first American Masked Rider series after its success adapting Super Sentai into \"Power Rangers\" and the Metal Hero Series (\"VR Troopers\" and \"Beetleborgs\"). In 2009 a new series, produced by Michael and Steve Wang, was broadcast.\n\n\"\", airing in 2009, was adapted from \"Kamen Rider Ryuki\". Although it was cancelled before finishing its syndicated run, it won the first Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Stunt Coordination at the 37th Daytime Emmy Awards.\n\nIn 1975, Chaiyo Productions; made an unofficial Kamen Rider movie entitled \"Hanuman and the Five Riders\", which used original footage of Chaiyo's Hanuman character, spliced with footage from the \"Five Riders Vs. King Dark\" movie. However, Chaiyo went ahead with the production without authorisation after Toei denied them permission to make an official movie with them, putting the legality of the movie into question.\n\nThe Kamen Rider franchise has been parodied in and outside Japan. One parody is of the Kamen Rider \"henshin\" (transforming) pose. In video games, Skullomania (from \"Street Fighter\") and May Lee (from \"King of Fighters\") are examples of Kamen Rider parodies. In anime, examples include \"Fair, then Partly Piggy\", \"My-HiME\" (and its sequel, \"My Otome\"), \"Dragon Ball Z\", and \"Franken Fran\" as parody or homage. In the \"Crayon Shin-chan\" series, the title character interacts with Kamen Riders in crossover specials. \"Detective Conan\" has a recurring TV series the detective boys like to watch, \"Kamen Yaiba\". In One Punch Man, the C Class Hero Mumen Rider is a parody, being an ordinary man in a world of superhuman beings, riding a bicycle rather than a motorcycle. However despite his weakness he is extremely heroic and his actions form a counterpoint to his parodic character conception. \n\nIn live action, parodies include \"Kamen Renaider\" by SMAP's Takuya Kimura and Shingo Katori, a parody of \"Ryuki\"; \"Kamen Zaiber\", a parody of the original; \"Kamen Norida\" by the Tunnels, a parody of Kamen Rider 1 and the first series; \"Kamen Rider HG\", Hard Gay's parody of the original for a Japanese TV show, and \"Ridermen\" (a short skit with a man called Ridermen, a parody of the Riderman on the set of \"Kamen Rider Kuuga\".\n\nAkimasa Nakamura named two minor planets in honor of the series: 12408 Fujioka for actor Hiroshi Fujioka, known for his portrayal of Takeshi Hongo/Kamen Rider 1, and 12796 Kamenrider for the series itself.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4750686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4750686", "title": "Law school rankings in the United States", "text": "Law school rankings in the United States\n\nLaw school rankings are a specific subset of college and university rankings dealing specifically with law schools. Like college and university rankings, law school rankings can be based on empirical data, subjectively-perceived qualitative data (often survey research of educators, law professors, lawyers, students, or others), or some combination of these. Such rankings are often consulted by prospective students as they choose which schools they will apply to or which school they will attend.\n\nThere are several different law school rankings, each with a different emphasis and different methodology. Most either emphasize inputs or readily measurable outcomes (i.e., outcomes shortly after graduation); none measure value-added or long-term outcomes. In general, these rankings are controversial, not universally accepted as authoritative.\n\nSeveral ranking systems are explicitly designed to focus on employment outcomes at or shortly after graduation, including rankings by the \"National Law Journal\" and Law.com.\n\nThe \"National Law Journal\" ranks the top 50 law schools by the percentage of juris doctor graduates who took jobs at NLJ 250 firms, the nation's largest by headcount as identified by \"The National Law Journal\"’s annual survey. It provides an alternative comparison of its own employment-based rankings to the \"U.S. New\"s rankings. For students who are primarily interested in lucrative employment outcomes rather than scholarly prestige, this comparison may suggest which law schools are most undervalued by the market. However, the \"National Law Journal\" ranking is considerably less mainstream due to its specificity and limited viewership compared to \"U.S. News\" publications.\n\n\"U.S. News & World Report\" organizes rankings into two main sections. The first section is a \"Top 145\" that lists the top one hundred forty-five schools in order from highest ranked to lowest ranked. While the top 145 law schools are ranked individually, \"U.S. News\" groups the remaining schools, or the bottom 25 percent of those that are ranked, into a \"Rank Not Published\" group. Schools that fall into this category are listed alphabetically and not by actual ranking. \"U.S. News\" also ranks each school's specialty programs using a similar method, if applicable. U.S. News ranked 196 schools in 2016. Each school's \"U.S. News\" ranking tends to fluctuate annually. \"U.S. News\"'s ranking system has incurred various criticisms over the years due in no small part to its arbitrary nature. The American Bar Association has issued disclaimers of law school rating systems. The ABA encourages prospective law students to consider a variety of factors in making their choice among schools.\n\n\"U.S. News\" rankings are heavily weighted toward \"reputation\", which is measured through a survey with small sample size and low response rates. The reputation scores are highly correlated with the previous years' reputation scores and may not reflect changes in law school quality over time.\n\n\"U.S. News\" has published an annual version of the rankings since 1987 (with the exception of 1988-89), and there has been consistency at the top of the \"U.S. News Rankings\". Yale Law School is consistently ranked first. There exists an informal category known as the top 14, or T14. This term refers to the 14 institutions that regularly claim the top spots in the yearly \"U.S. News & World Report\" ranking of American law schools. Only these top 14 schools have ever placed within the top 10 spots in the rankings. Although \"T14\" is not a designation used by \"U.S News\" itself, the term is \"widely known in the legal community.\" While these schools have seen their ranking within the top fourteen spots shift frequently, they have not placed outside of the top fourteen since the inception of the annual rankings (with rare exceptions). Because of their consistent placement at the top of these rankings, these schools are commonly referred to as the \"Top Fourteen\" in published books on Law School Admissions, undergraduate university pre-law advisers, professional law school consultants, and newspaper articles on the subject. There have been occasional changes in the top 14 ranking over the years, such as the University of Texas School of Law taking the 14th spot in 2017 and displacing Georgetown University to 15th, but the significance of these changes has been debated.\n\nThe schools that have at some point been ranked in the top 14 of the \"U.S. News & World Report\" Law School rankings are:\n\n\nSocial Science Research Network—a repository for draft and completed scholarship in law and the social sciences—publishes monthly rankings of law schools based on the number of times faculty members' scholarship was downloaded. Rankings are available by total number of downloads, total number of downloads within the last 12 months, and downloads per faculty member to adjust for the size of different institutions. SSRN also provides rankings of individual law school faculty members on these metrics.\n\nThe 2018 QS World University Rankings for Law ranked 13 U.S. institutions in the top 50 worldwide. The U.S. institutions in the top 10 were Harvard Law School, ranked first, with Yale Law School ranked fourth, Stanford Law School ranked fifth, NYU Law School ranked sixth, UC Berkeley School of Law ranked seventh and Columbia Law School ranked tenth. Every other Law school in \"U.S. News & World Report\" T14 rankings except University of Virginia School of Law and Northwestern University School of Law made the QS top 50. The UCLA School of Law was the only other U.S. school ranked in the top 50.\n\nIn 2017, ARWU released its rankings of World universities by Subject Law. Taking into account only the academic strength of the institution, it ranked Harvard Law School the first, NYU Law School the Second, Columbia Law the third, Chicago the fourth, Yale the fifth and Georgetown the sixth. Princeton University, which does not have a law school, is nevertheless ranked between 75 - 100 based on faculty from other subjects publishing in law journals.\n\nAmong the criticisms of law school rankings is that they are arbitrary in the characteristics they measure and the value given to each one. Another complaint is that a prospective law student should take into account the \"fit\" and appropriateness of each school, and that there is not a \"one size fits all\" ranking. Others complain that common rankings shortchange schools due to geographical or demographic reasons. One critic has gone so far as to create a website that sarcastically ranks US magazines. \"U.S. News\" is placed alone in the \"Third Tier.\"\n\nThe American Bar Association (ABA), has consistently refused to support or participate in law school rankings. Further, the Association of American Law Schools has also voiced criticisms of \"U.S. News\"'s ranking system. Carl Monk, its former executive director, once went so far as to say \"these rankings are a misleading and deceptive, profit-generating commercial enterprise that compromises \"U.S. News and World Report\"'s journalistic integrity.\"\n\nAs a response to the prevalence of law school rankings, the ABA and the LSAC publish an annual law school guide. This guide, which does not seek to rank or sort law schools by any criteria, instead seeks to provide the reader with a set of standard, important data on which to judge law schools. It contains information on all 200 ABA-Approved Law Schools. This reference, called The Official Guide to ABA-Approved Law Schools is provided free online and also in print for a small cost. A similar guide for Canadian Law Schools is also published by the Law School Admission Council and is called Official Guide to Canadian Law Schools. These guides seek to serve as an alternative to the \"U.S. News\" Rankings and law school rankings in general.\n\nAdditionally, the American Bar Association issued the MacCrate Report in 1992, which outlined many fundamental problems with modern legal education and called for reform in American law schools. While the report was hailed as a \"template for modern legal education\", its practice-oriented tenets have met resistance by law schools continually ranked in the \"top 13.\"\n\n\"U.S. News\" has not allowed these criticisms to go unanswered. They regularly outline and justify their methodology alongside the rankings, and have even published defenses of their value. Additionally, law professors William Henderson and Andrew Morriss have come out with a study criticizing law schools' (and the ABA's) refusal to adopt any better objective comparison method for the continued widespread reliance on U.S. News. Henderson and Morriss allege that law schools' attempts to \"game\" their \"U.S. News\" ranking by manipulating postgraduation employment statistics or applicant selectivity have led \"U.S. News\" to adjust its methodology accordingly, resulting in a counter-productive cycle. They go on to suggest that the ABA should use its accreditation power to mandate greater transparency in law schools' statistical reporting.\n\nIn March 2011, Loyola Law School Dean Victor Gold penned an op-ed in the \"Huffington Post\", accusing \"U.S. News & World Report\" of \"refus[ing] to consider diversity as a factor in its ranking system.\" Gold asserted that \"[t]here is a broad consensus among law school deans and professors that diversity enriches law school education.\" Loyola, which has a large Asian student body, claims 37% of its students are \"minorities,\" but it does not provide any specifics.\n\nDespite these criticisms, law school rankings in general and those by \"U.S. News\" in particular play a role in the world of legal education. When a school's ranking drops, fewer admitted applicants accept spots at the school, and people may get fired. Likewise, when a school rises in the rankings, the school often accidentally over-enrolls. This pressure has also resulted in various schools \"gaming the rankings.\" In a March 2003 article in \"Student Lawyer\", Jane Easter Bahls stated that, in order to appear more selective, some law schools reject applicants whose high LSAT scores indicate that they probably would go somewhere else. Other schools, in an attempt to increase the amount of money spent per student, increase tuition and return it to the students as financial aid.\n"}
{"id": "3478140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3478140", "title": "Lego Space", "text": "Lego Space\n\nLego Space is a Lego theme that features astronauts, spaceships, and extraterrestrial life. Originally introduced in 1978, it is one of the oldest and most expansive themes in Lego history, and contains over 200 individual sets. It was marketed under the \"Legoland\" banner until it became \"Lego System\" in 1992.\n\nAt least three Lego sets were released prior to so-called \"Classic\" Space theme, pre-dating the standard Lego minifigure. The early Space sets were limited by color selection and more specialized pieces had not yet been developed with most Lego sets of this era were composed of colorful stacked bricks. Once Lego began making individual themes in the 1970s, many new parts were created and older parts began appearing in new colors.\n\nThe first Lego Space sets began an era of more complicated and less colorful designs with a heavy emphasis on space exploration. Much of the early Space sets consisted of blue, grey, white, and transparent yellow and occasionally green. Designs began using more stacked plates instead of stacked bricks in order to make sleeker spaceship profiles. In its earliest stages, Space sets consisted only of ships and basic wheeled vehicles. But as science-fiction designs grew, the basic pattern of ground-buggies, walking robots, small and large spaceships, and bases developed. With the limited parts selection at the time, sets were still fairly simplistic with designs including: minifigure pilots steering their spacecraft with steering wheels, rocket engines could be simple transparent cones affixed to fence pieces, and visor-less helmets and often no in-flight pilot protection other than a spacesuit. The first minifigures released in this theme in 1978 wore either a red or white spacesuit with yellow spacemen debuting a year later. By the mid-1980s, the color palette had shifted to predominantly white with transparent blue theme, later used extensively in the Futuron theme, and two new colors of spacemen were introduced in blue and black uniforms. The first helmets, designed for the Castle series, had thin chinstraps that would break with normal use. Then in 1979, the helmet with thicker chinstraps appeared.\n\nIn 1987, Lego added \"factions\" to its space theme with the introduction of Blacktron and the new subtheme based on space exploration was given the name \"Futuron\". The new line kept the white and blue color scheme used in the later years of \"Classic\" Space but redesigned its minifigures. They came in four colors (red, blue, yellow and black), but had a new design with a zipper crossing from hip to shoulder and the color on top with white below, as well as utilizing a newly redesigned helmet that had a transparent light blue visor. Instead of a large spaceship, the theme centered around the Monorail Transport System, which featured a battery-powered train system and some twenty linear feet of track. At the time, this was the most expensive Lego set.\n\nAlong with Futuron, Blacktron was one of the first unified subthemes in Space. The set designs were based around a black and yellow color scheme with transparent yellow windscreens and transparent red highlights. Blacktron minifigures wore black jumpsuits akin to today's military pilots, with white trim and opaque black visors. Blacktron was a major step forward in set design from the rather clunky designs of \"Classic\" Space. It featured a large spacecraft, the \"Renegade\", which set the tone for all future big ships by splitting into a number of smaller modules, including a storage bin for a small wheeled vehicle, that could be recombined not just with each other, but with modules from other vehicles in the theme, specifically the \"Invader\" and \"Battrax\". This modular interchangeability became a staple of Lego Space until 1995.\n\nIn 1989, Lego further its storyline direction with the introduction of Space Police to oppose Blacktron, since police and robbers were popular sellers in its Lego Town theme. The Space Police sets had a black, blue, with red transparent color scheme and the minifigures shared the torso design with the black Futuron minifigure, but with a transparent red visor. This would be the first time that Lego had a \"bad guy\", \"good guy\" and \"civilian\" faction, a theme that would be used for the next decade. Space Police also utilized modular systems but on a smaller scale by featuring a Space Police jail cell that could be used interchangeably among almost all sets and came with a Blacktron occupant.\n\nIn 1990, Lego designed its next theme around magnets and M:Tron took over the \"civilian\" role of the Futuron faction. Vehicles in this set, distinctive for their red hulls, gray and black trim and transparent neon green canopies, are devoted primarily to exploration or mining and was the only civilian Space theme to not include any bases. They often featured crane-like attachments with magnets for picking up small cargo and storage boxes. These boxes, unfortunately, were generally not interchangeable. The figures wore white trousers, a red shirt with an \"M\" logo in the middle, and a black helmet with transparent neon green visor. This theme also extensively used brick-built robot figures to assist the M:Tron spacemen. These were the last sets produced under the \"Legoland\" banner before Lego began branding their sets as Lego System.\n\nIn 1991, Blacktron was revived as Blacktron Future Generation (or commonly called Blacktron II). Sets color designs were featured around black with white trim and transparent neon green canopies and the minifigures were redesigned with new uniforms and logo. It also replaced the creative but haphazard interchangeability of Blacktron I with mostly-uniform cockpit globes, which could be switched unimpeded between ships in other sets within the theme. However, only four sets of eleven featured them (the Alpha Centauri Outpost, Spectral Starguider, Aerial Intruder, and the Allied Avenger). Some fans were also disappointed that, aside from a proliferation of small (50-element-or-less) vehicles, Blacktron II seemed to be mostly a rehash of Blacktron I on a set-by-set basis.\n\nThe following year, Space Police was also revived, becoming Space Police II, to oppose the new Blacktron. The set designs featured black and grey with transparent green canopies and red trim. The standardized jail cells from the original were retained, though only three vehicles could accept them. The theme also lacked a permanent installation like Space Police I's Space Lock-Up Isolation Base. However, it was the first Space theme to replace the standard Lego smiley face minifigure head with a more complex print (in this case, the face augmented by a fringe of hair and an ear-mounted microphone). Finally, Space Police II ships were known for being under-armed; several vehicles sported no overt weapons (such as the Galactic Chief, whose epaulet-wearing pilot is armed with only a hand-held blaster that might actually be a megaphone), and the others featured only two small cockpit-mounted weapons (including the theme's heavyweight multi-module spaceship, the Galactic Mediator).\n\nIn 1993, Ice Planet 2002 took over the civilian role from M:Tron. Based around exploration on an ice planet, sets were designed with skis (both on vehicles and personnel), a blue and white color scheme with transparent neon orange canopies, and transparent neon orange chainsaws. As befitting an icebound theme, most of its vehicles were ground-based and many of its smaller vehicles also carried satellite dishes, seemingly to track or communicate with the rockets launched by the larger vehicles or its base. This was also the first Space theme to have a named character (Commander Cold) and a female minifigure. \n\nIn 1994, Spyrius replaced Blacktron as the \"bad\" faction and were apparently designed around spying and infiltration. The set designs were mostly red and black with transparent blue canopies. Most spaceships in this theme were shaped like flying saucers and the ground vehicles were designed like giant robots. The faction was often marketed as stealing technology from Unitron. This nine-set theme was the first to feature robot minifigures.\n\nAlso in 1994. Unitron took over the \"good guy\" role from the Space Police II. The Unitron theme revolved around a large monorail system powered by a 9V battery and the four sets were designed in blue and grey with transparent blue canopies and transparent neon green highlights. It also retained Lego interchangeability in the form of small cockpits which could dock on the front or top of its vehicles. Unfortunately, aside from a ground installation, a large buggy, an advanced looking spaceship, and the monorail, the theme was underdeveloped.\n\nExcept for the Monorail set, the theme was only released in USA.\n\nIn 1996 Lego returning to the white and transparent blue canopies of Futuron with the Exploriens Theme. Sets are known for their use of large, open (sometimes rickety) structures and special image elements (e.g., as foil-holograph stickers for viewscreens). The Exploriens were searching, evidently, for fossils and certain flat plates contained triple images: one in white, for the naked eye; one in blue, for viewing under transparent red scanners; and one in red, for viewing under transparent blue scanners. It was the second space theme to include a robot minifigure, some also considered this the second Space theme to include a female minifigure, however this minifigure was actually a feminine robot named Ann Droid. The theme shares many similarities with the popular \"Star Trek\" TV Series, with the faction's main focus being with exploration, their robot figure's name being a play on \"android\", and their race's insignia resembling Starfleet's insignia.\n\nIn 1997, taking over the \"good guy\" role was another four-set theme, Roboforce. The sets featured various large robots in varying color schemes, run by similarly uniformed pilots. Neon Orange Class features humanoid robots equipped with a buzz saw or a chainsaw. The \"head\" of each robot was also a small space ship that could be used as an escape pod or secondary vehicle. Neon Green Class featured animal shaped robots. The Robo Raptor was the only set not to feature a space craft, while the Robo Master's small starcraft strongly resembled the Unitron \"Star Hawk II\" as a tribute to the fan favorite set. Roboforce \"Robos\" were powered by \"secret\" \"robo disks\" which were oddly enough \"rectangle\"-shaped power sources.\n\nThe theme was only released in USA.\n\nUFO was the first Lego Space theme to feature aliens instead of humans. All of UFO's minifigures were cybernetic in nature, and featured two wholly robot figures (the red one was said to be \"Andy Droid\", Ann Droid's brother stolen from the Exploriens, according to the Lego Company), and as befitting its name, many of its spaceships used saucers or half-saucers as elements. It has the smallest proportion of wheeled ground vehicles to ships (two to nine) of any Lego Space theme before or since. The UFO theme is often considered the first Space theme to heavily rely on large pieces meant to provide effects (such as curvature) that would be difficult to achieve with traditional Lego pieces, something that became common for the next decade.\n\nThe second alien race to actually look alien, the Insectoids were insect-like humanoid cyborgs especially interested in \"energy orbs\" which included magnetic stickers so that magnets attached to cranes could lift them. Insectoids are unusual in that Lego had never before in Lego Space released two \"bad guy\" factions in a row. According to the LEGO Group, the Insectoids had crash-landed on an alien planet filled with enormous bugs, and in order to steal their giant egg orbs to refuel their spaceships and escape, they were forced to disguise themselves and their spaceships as bugs. After escaping the planet, the Insectoid went out into the galaxy to make life miserable for the other races with their mischievous and pest-like nature, while looking for more \"energy orbs\" to power their technology. This is usually considered to be the last Space subtheme in which the entire theme is \"good\", \"bad\", or \"civilian\".\n\nLife on Mars is a space theme released in 2001, around a time of increased curiosity about the red planet. The theme revolved around the concept of the lifeforms that could possibly exist on Mars.\n\nThis was the first Space theme to feature two types of minifigures: human astronauts and Martian aliens. The sets denote peaceful coexistence between the two species on the planet Mars. The \"Life on Mars\" theme pioneered several unique aspects in Lego in general. It was the first Lego theme to utilize a pneumatic pump system that was capable of sending Martian minifigures through tubes in the 7317 Aero Tube Hangar set. This system would later be seen in the \"Mars Mission\" theme to shoot missiles. The theme also introduced several new muted colors to the Lego color palette, including Sand Green, Sand Blue, Sand Red, and Sand Purple. Sets were designed to separate into segments easily to encourage children to mix and create their own unique vehicles out of both human and alien sets.\n\nMartians in the \"Life on Mars\" theme were unique in that they were named after real-life stars and constellations: Altair, Centauri, Antares, Canopus, Pollux, Vega, Arcturus, Cassiopeia, Mizar, and Rigel.\n\n\"Mars Mission\" is the second space theme to feature both humans and aliens and is a reboot of \"Life on Mars\". Unlike \"Life on Mars\", the aliens (a different breed of Martians) and humans were pitted against each other as children had been fond of doing with the original line.\n\nSpace Police III continued the Lego trend of humans (or at least human-looking) versus aliens started in the former Mars Mission theme. This is the first time the Space Police have been pitted against monstrous looking aliens instead of human looking villains, like Blacktron or Spyrius. It is also the first Space Police theme to include enemy ships instead of just prisoners and is the first Space Police theme in 16 years. A gang, including: \"Kranxx\", \"Snake\", the \"Skull Twins\", \"Slizer\" and \"Squidman\", are the main troublemakers for Space Police III with independent, \"Frenzy\", keeping them busy as well. However, \"Rench\" bears the old Blacktron Future Generation logo on his uniform (which is an updated original Blacktron uniform), hinting that he may have a connection with the old Blacktron faction, as well as hinting that the Space Police are in the same continuity as their older versions.\n\nAlien Conquest was released in May 2011, and is the first Lego Space subtheme to take place on Earth. A new wave of aliens begins attacking Earth. Multiple cities around the globe report massive abductions and UFOs in the night sky. The UFOs are finally identified as aliens in saucer-shaped space-craft, who are abducting humans for brainpower to power their spaceships, which bear resemblance to the Classic UFO line of space. Panic breaks out worldwide, and the Alien Defense Unit takes up the cause. Using their ubiquitous blue vehicles, they fight back against the aliens, stopping abductions in their tracks.\n\n2013's space-specific theme, Galaxy Squad, features a team of intergalactic heroes and robot sidekicks trying to defeat an alien race of humanoids with insect features intent on \"cocooning\" the galaxy with special 2-piece cocoons which trap a standard minifigure. The vehicles of the heroes feature a notable \"split function\" ability, which allows them to split into two different vehicles.\n\nSeveral licensed Lego themes have featured space elements as well. The most notable licensed theme with space elements is \"Star Wars\", produced since 1999. Nearly 700 Lego \"Star Wars\" sets have been produced so far, as well as four video games and numerous other licensed merchandise.\n\n2003's Discovery theme produced six sets related to past and present NASA efforts at the time, including the Apollo Program, the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station, and the Mars Exploration Rover mission.\n\n2010's \"Toy Story\" theme produced Buzz's Star Command Spaceship, which is based on the Buzz Lightyear toy's background from that universe.\n\nSince 2012, Lego has produced sets from both the Marvel and DC comic book universes, both of which feature many elements derived from space.\n\nIn 2015, Lego released a set under its Ideas theme based on the BBC science fiction TV series \"Doctor Who\", along with two expansion packs for the toys-to-life video game Lego Dimensions.\n\nLego has produced four subthemes with space-related content for its Town and City themes: Launch Command, Space Port, City Space 2011, and City Space 2015. Each of these subthemes involves a realistic, Earth-based approach to space exploration. These subthemes are not considered to be official Lego Space themes.\n\n2008 saw the release of two space sets through the LEGO Factory theme. Star Justice and Space Skulls were fan-designed sets released as special edition sets available only through LEGO. In 2017, Lego Creator had two space related sets, the \"Robot Explorer\" and the \"Space Shuttle Explorer\".\n\nLEGO Ideas (previously known as Lego Cuusoo), a program which allows users to submit their own ideas for commercial sets, has produced two sets related to real-life space efforts so far. Hayabusa is based on the spacecraft \"Hayabusa\" created by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover is based on \"Curiosity\", a rover created by NASA that explores the surface of Mars. In 2017, two sets were released: one based on the Saturn V rocket used during the Apollo 11 mission, and the other called \"Women of NASA\" that contained four out of the five minifigures from the original project, with Katherine Johnson missing due to licensing issues. The four minifigures that were made, though, were Sally Ride, Margaret Hamilton, Mae Jemison, and Nancy Grace Roman. In addition, it has released one non-licensed set based on the Classic Space line in 2014, the Exo Suit (set #21109), which includes two minifigures in a new green version of the Classic Space uniform.\n\nIn 2014, a set titled \"Benny's Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP\"' (set #70816) was released as a tie-in to \"The Lego Movie\", which featured many references to past Lego Space themes. The spaceship itself is highly reminiscent of Classic Space spaceships, with a predominantly blue and grey colour scheme. The pilot of the ship, Benny (voiced by Charlie Day) is a blue Classic Space minifigure with notable signs of wear and tear, including a broken chinstrap on his helmet. A set from the spin-off film \"The Lego Batman Movie\" called the \"Bat-Space Shuttle\" was also released in 2018.\n"}

{"id": "6965511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6965511", "title": "Ordinary People (novel)", "text": "Ordinary People (novel)\n\nOrdinary People is Judith Guest's first novel. Published in 1976, it tells the story of a year in the life of the Jarretts, an affluent suburban family trying to cope with the aftermath of two traumatic events.\n\nAlthough it won critical praise and awards upon its release, it is best remembered today as the basis for the 1980 film version, which won four Academy Awards including Best Picture. It is also assigned in many American secondary school English classes.\n\nThe novel begins as life is seemingly returning to normal for the Jarretts of Lake Forest, Illinois, in September 1975. It is slightly more than a year since their elder son Buck was killed when a sudden storm came up while he and their other son Conrad were sailing on Lake Michigan. Six months later, a severely depressed Conrad attempted suicide by slashing his wrists with a razor in the bathroom. His parents committed him to a psychiatric hospital from which he has only recently returned after four months of treatment. He is attending school and trying to resume his life, but knows he still has unresolved issues, particularly with his mother, Beth, who has never really recovered from Buck's death and keeps an almost maniacally perfect household and family.\n\nHis father Calvin, a successful tax attorney, gently leans on him to make appointments to see a local psychiatrist, Dr. Tyrone Berger. Initially resistant, he slowly starts to respond to Dr. Berger and comes to terms with the root cause of his depression, his identity crisis and survivor's guilt over having survived when Buck did not. Also helping is a relationship with a new girlfriend, Jeannine Pratt.\n\nCalvin sees Dr. Berger as the events of the recent past have caused him to begin to doubt many things he once took for granted, leading to a midlife crisis. This leads to strain in his marriage as he finds Beth increasingly cold and distant, while she in turn believes he is overly concerned about Conrad to the point of being manipulated. Finally the friction becomes enough that Beth decides to leave him at the novel's conclusion. Father and son, however, have closed the gap between them.\n\n\nThree other characters do not appear in the story directly but have a strong effect on it nonetheless, recalled extensively by Conrad and Calvin:\n\n\nLoss and the different ways people deal with it are a major theme of \"Ordinary People\". Conrad loses not only his brother but a good portion of his then-self when Buck dies. His father finds himself re-examining his life and seeing it more the result of random chance and accident than any ability on his part. Beth tries to control it like everything else in her life. She and Conrad were, Calvin notes, the only people not to cry at Buck's funeral.\n\nGuest's chapters alternate between Conrad and Calvin, in third person limited omniscient narration entirely in the present tense. Readers are privy to their thoughts but not those of the other characters in the scene, not even Cal or Conrad if they happen to intrude. The narrative frequently goes into patches of italicized interior monologue and stream of consciousness.\n\nThe novel also circles around both the accident that killed Buck and Conrad's suicide attempt. In the initial chapters they are both only referenced or discussed in the most general terms; later on we learn more details and finally get brief flashbacks from Conrad.\n\nGuest began \"Ordinary People\" as a short story, but found herself writing more and more as she explored the characters in greater depth, wanting to know more about their backgrounds. \"Before I knew it,\" she says \"I was 200 pages in\". It took her three years to write, after she gave up her teaching job and decided to concentrate on actually finishing a novel.\n\nIt became focused on the psychology of the characters, particularly Conrad.\n\nI wanted to explore the anatomy of depression — how it works and why it happens to people; how you can go from being down but able to handle it, to being so down that you don’t even want to handle it, and then taking a radical step with your life — trying to commit suicide — and failing at that, coming back to the world and having to \"act normal\" when, in fact, you have been \"forever changed\".\nGuest did not have an agent initially. The first publisher she sent it to rejected it. The second sent a rejection letter that read in part: \"While the book has some satiric bite, overall the level of writing does not sustain interest and we will have to decline it.\" An editor at Viking Press bought the manuscript, but the company waited eight months before putting it out, the first time in 26 years it had published an unsolicited manuscript.\n\nIt would go on to win the Janet Heidiger Kafka Prize for best first novel. Ninety thousand copies were sold in hardback; Robert Redford, who would eventually direct the film, acquired the rights before publication (actually traveling to Guest's suburban Minnesota home to do so). Since 1976, half a million copies of the paperback have been sold.\n\nIn the wake of the film version, the novel has been assigned in many American high school (and sometimes middle school) English classes due to its young-adult protagonist. This has led to some challenges to its inclusion on reading lists and curricula due to not only the subject matter but a short scene near the end of the novel in which Conrad and Jeannine make love. The American Library Association ranked it 59th on its list of the hundred most frequently challenged books in school libraries during the 1990s.\n\nIn the first edition of the book, Karen erroneously credits Neil Simon as the playwright for \"A Thousand Clowns\" rather than Herb Gardner. Some astute readers wrote to Judith Guest to report the error. She graciously wrote back with thanks to at least one MSU freshman reader who theorized that the error might be intended to foreshadow Karen's mental instability. [cdw]\n\nRobert Redford bought the rights to Guest's manuscript before it was published, intending not to act in it but make his directorial debut with the film. \"Ordinary People\" was released in 1980, winning that year's Academy Award for Best Picture. Redford and Timothy Hutton also received Oscars for directing and acting, respectively.\n\nThe novel has also been adapted into a play.\n"}

Partial hospitalization programs are available at least five days per week but may also offer half-day, weekend, or evening hours. Partial hospitalization programs may be freestanding or part of a broader system but should be identifiable as a distinct and separately organized unit.A partial hospitalization program consists of a series of structured, face-to-face therapeutic sessions organized at various levels of intensity and frequency. Partial hospitalization programs are typically designed for persons who are experiencing increased symptomatology, disturbances in behavior, or other conditions that negatively impact the mental or behavioral health of the person served. The program must be able to address the presenting problems in a setting that is not residential or inpatient. Given this, the persons served in partial hospitalization do not pose an immediate risk to themselves or others. Services are provided for the purpose of diagnostic evaluation; active treatment of a person’s condition; or to prevent relapse, hospitalization, or incarceration. Such a program functions as an alternative to inpatient care, as transitional care following an inpatient stay in lieu of continued hospitalization, as a step-down service, or when the severity of symptoms is such that success in a less acute level of care is tenuous.\"Medicare Part B will potentially reimburse for these services if there is agreement between the PHP and referring doctor.\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General in the United States of (North) America issued report that outlines nine characteristics of questionable billing in PHPs based on past input from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) staff. Data was used from Medicare claims between 2009 and 2010 and were from the National Claims History File. The first sentence of each of the nine characteristics:1. Beneficiaries who received only group psychotherapy during their\nPHP participation. 2. Beneficiaries who were not referred to PHPs by health care facilities.3. Beneficiaries who were not evaluated by physicians during their PHP\nparticipation. 4. Beneficiaries with no mental health diagnoses a year prior to\nparticipating in PHPs. 5. Beneficiaries who participated in PHPs at CMHCs outside their\ncommunities. 6. Beneficiaries who participated in PHPs at more than one CMHC.7. Beneficiaries with cognitive disorders who participated in PHPs.8. Beneficiaries with long durations of PHP participation.9. Beneficiaries who were readmitted to inpatient treatment. The report that authored these nine characteristics also determined if the percentage of Community Mental Health Centers with questionable billing changed based on whether states had 'license or certification requirements'.\n\n"}

NPR's Stephen Marche described it as Thompson's \"true masterpiece, a preposterously upsetting, ridiculously hilarious layer cake of nastiness, a romp through a world of nearly infinite deceit.\"\n\n\"Pop. 1280\" is the first-person narrative of Nick Corey, the listless sheriff of Potts County, the \"47th (out of 47) largest county in the state\". He lives in Pottsville which has a population of \"1280 souls\".\n\nSheriff Nick Corey presents himself as a genial fool, simplistic, over-accommodating, and harmless to a fault, given he is Pottsville's sole lawman. In reality, he is a clever psychopath able to manipulate people by appealing to their worst instincts and to get away with multiple murders. \n\nThe novel begins with Nick visiting Ken Lacey, the sheriff of a near by county. Nick visits sheriff Lacey ostensibly to ask for advice as he has in the past. Nick has two pimps in charge of a whorehouse on the river at the edge of town who regularly insult and abuse him. Nick asks Lacey what to do about them and Lacey mocks and belittles Nick including literally kicking him in the behind multiple times, finally explaining that he is doing all this to show Nick that when someone hurts you, you need to hurt them back twice as hard, finishing with the boast that if any pimps tried to disrespect him (sheriff Lacey) he would shoot them dead on the spot. In the process of suffering the abuse of Lacey and his deputy Buck, Nick realizes that Buck harbors ill will toward sheriff Lacey as well. He manipulates Lacey to have Buck see him off at the train station and has a discussion with Buck before heading back home.\n\nEarly that evening Nick goes to see the two pimps. As usual they berate and mock him for taking their graft and for being generally spineless. Nick plays the fool and takes their abuse waiting for a steamboat to traverse a bend in the river and blow its whistle. When it does, to the shock of the pimps, Nick pulls his gun and kills them both, relying on the noise of the whistle to cover the sound of his gun.\n\nHe dumps their bodies in the river and returns home to take a nap. He’s awakened by his wife Myra to find that sheriff Lacey has come to see him. At the prodding of his deputy Buck sheriff Lacey became concerned that Nick might actually kill the pimps and make him an accessory for encouraging the crime. Nick reassures Lacey that the thought never entered his mind. He gets Lacey drunk and then apologizes that even though it’s too late to get a train back Nick doesn’t have room to let Lacey stay the night and there are no hotels in Pottsville. He tells Lacey the only place to spend the night is the whorehouse run by the pimps. In his drunken state Lacey is eager to spend the night this way. As Nick walks him there he manipulates Lacey to brag to several people that he would never take abuse from the pimps, virtually claiming he would kill them if they tried. He further manipulates Lacey to make similar claims to the prostitutes at the house.\n\nThe next day, the county attorney Robert Lee Jefferson berates Nick for not doing his job and never making any arrests. Jefferson warns Nick that he will face a strong opponent in the coming election from Sam Gaddis. Nick replies that the people don’t really want him to do his job, that they enjoy petty crimes such as gambling, public drunkenness, and prostitution and that if he started to arrest people for such crimes he would have to arrest the whole town. Jefferson is adamant that Nick needs to stop being so lazy and cowardly because Gaddis is everything that Nick is not. Nick agrees with Jefferson that Gaddis is a man of the highest moral quality regardless of all the rumors about him people are spreading. Jefferson asks and then demands to know what these rumors are but Nick refuses to tell him. In reality there are no rumors but Nick realizes that he has planted a seed that will result in them.\n\nNick then goes to find Tom Hauck, the husband of Rose Hauck who Nick is having an affair with. He finds Hauck drinking and fishing at the river. Nick tells Hauck that he has been having sex with his wife and as Hauck begins to sputter with rage Nick picks up Hauck’s shotgun and lets him have both barrels in the stomach. As Hauck lies in agonizing pain Nick kicks him a few times and leaves him to die a painful death. Nick leaves Hauck to go see Hauck’s wife Rose. He encourages Rose to have sex with him, but as much as she wants to, she has work that must be done at her farm or her husband will viciously beat her when he returns from fishing. Nick toys with her a while then finally gives her the news that he has killed her husband. She is overjoyed and they retreat to her bedroom to have passionate sex.\n\nIn addition to Rose Hauck, Nick is also having an affair with Amy Mason. He sometimes has difficulties juggling both affairs while keeping either woman as well as his wife Myra and her imbecile brother Lennie from discovering them but by quick thinking and manipulation he is always able to.\n\nWhere as Rose is foul mouthed and hypocritical, Amy is the only person in Pottsville that is beyond Nick's manipulation because she has a strong sense of morality. As she learns that Nick is planning to frame sheriff Lacey for the murder of the two pimps which Nick committed she threatens to tell the authorities regardless of any potential consequences for her and Nick realizes that she would actually do it. This makes Amy more appealing to Nick than Rose. He realizes that he must choose between them because Amy is too intelligent to try and deceive about his relation with Rose and she will no longer tolerate Nick seeing Rose. \n\nNick comes up with a way to get rid of his wife Myra, her brother, and Rose all at once. He manipulates Rose, who thinks she is taking part in a scheme to get rid of Nick's wife, to tell Myra's brother Lennie that she has seen him and Myra having passionate sex. Upon hearing this, Myra takes Lennie and heads for Rose's house. Myra breaks in on Rose and tells her that because she discovered her and Lennie's secret (what seemed like a vicious rumor turned out to be the truth) she is going to have Lennie rape her while she takes photos in order to blackmail Rose and force her to leave town. Rose gets a pistol that she purchased to protect herself from her abusive husband and kills both Myra and her brother. \n\nRose finally realizes she has been manipulated by Nick. When she confronts Nick he just laughs at her and suggests she get out of town as soon as possible before the bodies are discovered. Toward the end of the novel Nick's inner dialog becomes more and more delusional as he comes to believe he is Jesus come to earth to dispense justice on the guilty, hypocritical people of Pottsville. The novel ends without Nick being caught for any of his crimes but with the impression that circumstances are finally catching up to him while he becomes more delusional.\n\nThe character of a sheriff who plays the fool but is in reality highly intelligent is used several times by Thompson. Sometimes, as in this novel and The Killer Inside Me the sheriff is a psychopath. In the novels Wild Town and The Transgressors the sheriff is heroic, a highly intelligent man who was forced by circumstances to take a job that didn’t allow him to take full advantage of his abilities and who plays at being a clown to fit in to his role and to manipulate people for altruistic ends.\n\nIn his autobiographical book Bad Boy Thompson said this character was based on an actual deputy who pursued him when he neglected to pay a fine for being drunk and disturbing the peace. As recounted in a NY Times article, Thompson describes the encounter he had with the deputy: \n\nThe sheriff also is quite likely based to some degree on Thompson's own father, who had many of the same characteristics: a born politician who knew just what to say to win favor with anyone and who appeared friendly on the outside but inside harbored a great deal of pent up rage and misanthropy. \n\nPop 1280 is also one of Thompson's most overtly political book. Nick constantly uses jokes to point oout the racism, classism, and sexism of American society, for example when at the end of his discussion with the county attorney who is after Nick to make more arrests Nick promises to arrest anyone who breaks the law \"Providing o' course, that he's either colored or some poor white trash that can't pay his pole tax\".\n\n\"Pop. 1280\" was adapted as the French film \"Coup de Torchon\" (1981), directed by Bertrand Tavernier, set in French West Africa in 1938.\n\n"}

A seminar of Islamic scholars in Kuwait on genetics and genetic engineering in October 1998 concluded that although there are fears about the possibility of the harmful effects of GM food technology and GM food products on human beings and the environment, there are no laws within Islam which stop the genetic modification of food crops and animals. And in 2003, the Indonesian Ulemas Council (MUI) approved the importation and consumption of genetically modified food products by Indonesian Muslims. Others have written that while there are Quranic verses forbidding humanity from defacing God's creation, these \"cannot be invoked as a total and radical ban on genetic engineering ... If carried too far, it would conflict with many forms of curative surgery that also entail some change in God's creation\".\n\nVoices in opposition to GMOs argue, based on the Quran, that there is no need for genetic modification of food crops because God created everything perfectly and man does not have any right to manipulate anything that God has created nor to tamper with it.\n\nViews of Rome on genetic engineering\nIn 1999, after two years of discussions, the Vatican's Pontifical Academy for Life stated that modifying the genes of plants and animals is theologically acceptable. The Guardian reported that \"Bishop Elio Sgreccia, vice- president of the pontifical academy, said: 'We are increasingly encouraged that the advantages of genetic engineering of plants and animals are greater than the risks. The risks should be carefully followed through openness, analysis and controls, but without a sense of alarm.' Referring to genetically modified products such as corn and soya, Sgreccia added: 'We give it a prudent 'yes' We cannot agree with the position of some groups that say it is against the will of God to meddle with the genetic make-up of plants and animals.'\"\n\nIn 2000 as part of the Great Jubilee Pope John Paul II gave an address concerning agriculture, at which he said: The \"famous words of Genesis entrust the earth to man's use, not abuse. They do not make man the absolute arbiter of the earth's governance, but the Creator's \"co-worker\": a stupendous mission, but one which is also marked by precise boundaries that can never be transgressed with impunity. This is a principle to be remembered in agricultural production itself, whenever there is a question of its advance through the application of biotechnologies, which cannot be evaluated solely on the basis of immediate economic interests. They must be submitted beforehand to rigorous scientific and ethical examination, to prevent them from becoming disastrous for human health and the future of the earth.\"\n\nA 2002 meeting between bishops and scientists in the Philippines concluded that biotechnology could be an important stepping stone in the struggle against hunger and environmental pollution.\n\nA 2003 symposium gathered by Cardinal Renato T. Martino has examined the use of GMOs in modern agriculture. The symposium's study argued that the future of humanity is at stake and that there is no room for the ideological arguments advanced by environmentalists.\nVelasio De Paolis, a professor of canon law at the Pontifical Urban University, has said that it was \"easy to say no to GM food if your stomach is full\".\n\nIn 2008, Fr. Sean McDonagh, an Irish Columban priest and \"well-known commentator on environmental issues\", questioned whether hosts from transgenic wheat could ever be approved by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith because of the Church's strict rules regarding sacramental bread. He specifically cited canon 924, which stipulates the bread must be wheaten only, and recently made, so that there is no danger of corruption.\n\nA 2009 study on genetically modified organisms sponsored by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences came to a favorable conclusion on GMOs, viewing them as praiseworthy for improving the lives of the poor.\n\nThe Philippines is a predominantly Catholic country, and official pronouncements of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) exert a strong influence in policy making and the CBCP has not supported biotechnology, and probably will not until there is an official endorsement from the Pope. President Arroyo’s visit to Rome on September 27, 2003, she apparently consulted Pope John Paul II about the Church position on biotechnology. On the basis of that meeting, she issued a statement indicating that she felt it was important that opponents of GMOs knew that according to the Vatican, GMOs are not immoral. The CBCP issued a statement in response stating that the Pope had not endorsed GMOs. In 2009 Bishop Vicente Navarra of the Diocese of Bacolod in the Philippines issued a pastoral letter calling on the Negros Occidental and Bacolod City governments to continue banning the entry of GMO products.\n\nIn 2004, the Church Environmental Network, representing members of the Anglican church of South Africa, spoke out against the South African government's backing of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\n\nChristian Aid, a British ecumenical group, released a paper in 2000 that expressed sharp concerns about the agricultural biotechnology industry, particularly with regard to its potential effects on impoverished people and economic development in the developing world.\n\nAbout 550 Amish farmers in Pennsylvania have adopted nicotine-free tobacco since 2001, because it pays \"about $1.50 per pound for the nicotine-free tobacco, nearly double the 80-cent-per-pound rate for traditional tobacco. GMO crops do not conflict with the Amish lifestyle.\n\nWhile the Rastafari Movement as a whole has no central authority, a Rastafari Code of Conduct was ratified in July–August 2008 at a meeting in Jamaica of the Nyah Binghi Order, one of the three houses of the Rastafari movement; that Code defines GM food as not Ital.\n"}

Produced by Tiger Aspect Productions, it was written by Allan Cubitt and was a sequel to the same company's adaptation of \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\", made for the BBC two years previously. Although \"Silk Stocking\" retained the same Dr. Watson, Ian Hart, this time the character of Sherlock Holmes was played by Rupert Everett.\n\nIn November 1903, young women are being killed in London, each with a silk stocking stuffed down her throat. Watson seeks help from the retired and disenchanted Holmes, who determines that the victims are well-born ladies, not prostitutes. Evidence found includes a thumbprint, a pair of ladies' dancing shoes, broken glass, a strong smell of chloroform and a silk stocking removed from a victim's gullet. It seems that the killer has a foot fetish.\n\nHolmes interrogates a survivor - a young girl who was apparently set free by her captor because she has a club foot - and arranges for her to \"accidentally\" see the footman that he suspects is the killer, despite his ironclad alibis. The girl identifies him as her kidnapper, but the thumbprint clears the suspect. Holmes then baits a trap for the killer: he uses the sister of a victim and has her perform in a classical tableau at an event attended by the King and Queen. Her Grecian-Roman costume is revealing, and her sandals expose her feet. After the performance, she walks away to be alone; the suspect drugs her and is quickly caught by Holmes and placed in custody. The sister returns home and is tucked into bed by her father.\n\nHowever, the suspect's thumbprint doesn't match the evidence. Holmes suspects the killer has an identical twin, and that the real killer is still on the loose. Holmes telephones the father of the \"bait\" sister to warn him, but the real killer has kidnapped her from her bed just minutes earlier. The audience sees the killer carrying her over his shoulder as blood drips from her face, where he cut her with broken glass.\n\nThe police force the other twin to lead them to his brother, but he escapes the police. Holmes finds the killer and his victim just in time; the young woman has a silk stocking tied around her neck, and Watson has to cut it and perform something that looks like CPR. Holmes gets the killer twin to confess that he wanted his victims' attention, because they looked at him while in captivity. Both twins are then taken into custody.\n\nAt the end, Watson marries an American psychoanalyst and leaves on honeymoon, and Holmes is left sitting alone at the table.\n\n\nSome co-production funding for the drama was provided by United States PBS broadcaster WGBH, and it was later shown on PBS's \"Masterpiece Theatre\" in 2005. The original title for the production was \"Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Season\", the name being changed only a few weeks before transmission. While Ian Hart returned from the earlier \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" film, in this film Rupert Everett replaced Richard Roxburgh as Sherlock Holmes. Guy Henry who had earlier portrayed Sherlock Holmes in \"\" was cast in the minor role of Mr. Bilney.\n\nDirected by Simon Cellan Jones, the production filmed in and around London in late summer 2003. The musical score is by Adrian Johnston.\n\nThe book given to Holmes by Mrs Vandeleur is \"Psychopathia Sexualis\".\n\nUnlike \"Baskervilles\", this production was an original story written by Allan Cubitt, although the script used some lines of dialogue for Holmes taken from Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories. Set in the early 1900s, Cubitt provided Watson with a new wife and indicates that it had been some time since he and Holmes last worked together.\n\nReviews of the drama were generally mixed. \"I did feel that this peculiar tale was intended to tickle American tootsies,\" Nancy Banks-Smith wrote in \"The Guardian\". \"The king was announced as 'King Edward the Seventh', Dr Watson married a Yankee psychiatrist [psychoanalyst], the duchess was having an affair with the footman, well, two as it turned out, and the London fog never lifted.\"\n\nThe film is currently holding a rating of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic. Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\" remarked, \"Everett sticks close enough to the outline created by Arthur Conan Doyle to be recognizably Sherlockian, and yet he deviates enough to create an amusing character all his own.\" Dorothy Rabinowitz of the \"Wall Street Journal\" wrote, \"Everett carries the role of the master detective off with dispatch—a portrayal rich in tortured silences and seasoned with touches of campy authority.\" Marilyn Stasio, writing for \"The Daily Telegraph\", called Everett's interpretation \"elegant and decidedly decadent\".\n\nMelanie McFarland of the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" said, \"\"The Case of the Silk Stocking\" contains more than the usual share of pedestrian turns of phrase, and Neil Dudgeon's Inspector Lestrade is less than an afterthought here. Everett makes up for it with a haunting portrayal.\" Brian Lowry of \"Variety\" wrote, \"\"The Case of the Silk Stocking\" is a rather wan addition to the Holmes filmography, yet respectable enough in showcasing the character's cerebral charms. If push comes to shove, though, when all the revisionism's done, I prefer my Holmes in black-and-white.\"\n\nThe \"Daily Telegraph\" rated Everett as number 12 on their 20 greatest Sherlock Holmes.\n\nThe film was released on DVD in 2005, with an audio commentary by Cellan Jones and producer Elinor Day.\n\n"}
{"id": "2798456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2798456", "title": "Silk Road transmission of art", "text": "Silk Road transmission of art\n\nMany artistic influences transited along the Silk Road, especially through the Central Asia, where Hellenistic, Iranian, Indian and Chinese influence were able to interact. In particular Greco-Buddhist art represent one of the most vivid examples of this interaction.\nAs shown on the 1st century CE Silk Road map, there is no single road but a whole network of long-distance routes: mainly two land routes and one sea route.\n\nFollowing contacts of metropolitan China with nomadic western and northwestern border territories in the 8th century BCE, gold was introduced from Central Asia, and Chinese jade carvers began to make imitation designs of the steppes, adopting the Scythian-style animal art of the steppes (descriptions of animals locked in combat). This style is particularly reflected in the rectangular belt plaques made of gold and bronze with alternate versions in jade and steatite.\n\nEven though that happened, the correspondence between the \"Scythians\" as an ethnic group and their material culture is still subject to discussion and research. The subject is part of the broader \"nomadic\" and \"sedentary\" debate.\n\nFollowing the expansion of the Greco-Bactrians into Central Asia, Greek influences on Han art have often been suggested (Hirth, Rostovtzeff). Designs with rosette flowers, geometric lines, and glass inlays, suggestive of Hellenistic influences, can be found on some early Han dynasty bronze mirrors.\n\nThe image of the Buddha, originating during the 1st century CE in northern India (areas of Gandhara and Mathura) was transmitted progressively through Central Asia and then China until it reached Japan in the 6th century.\n\nTo this day however the transmission of many iconographical details is still visible, such as the Hercules inspiration behind the Nio guardian deities in front of Japanese Buddhist temples, or representations of the Buddha reminiscent of Greek art such as the Buddha in Kamakura.\n\n\"See also: History of Buddhism, Buddhist art, Greco-Buddhist art\"\n\nSome elements of western iconography were adopted from the East along the Silk Road. The aureole in Christian art first appeared in the 5th century, but practically the same device was known several centuries earlier, in non-Christian art. It is found in some Persian representations of kings and Gods, and appears on coins of the Kushan kings Kanishka, Huvishka and Vasudeva, as well as on most representations of the Buddha in Greco-Buddhist art from the 1st century CE.\nAnother image which appears to have transferred from China via the Silk Road is the symbol of the Three hares, showing three animals running in a circle. It has been traced back to the Sui dynasty in China, and is still to be found in sacred sites in many parts of Western Europe, and especially in churches in Dartmoor, Devon.\n\nAnother Buddhist deity, named Shukongoshin, one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is also an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god Herakles to the Far-East along the Silk Road. Herakles was used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent Vajrapani, the protector of the Buddha, and his representation was then used in China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples. \nVarious other artistic influences from the Silk Road can be found in Asia, one of the most striking being that of the Greek Wind God Boreas, transiting through Central Asia and China to become the Japanese Shinto wind god Fūjin.\n\nIn consistency with Greek iconography for Boreas, the Japanese wind god holds above his head with his two hands a draping or \"wind bag\" in the same general attitude. The abundance of hair have been kept in the Japanese rendering, as well as exaggerated facial features.\nFinally, the Greek artistic motif of the floral scroll was transmitted from the Hellenistic world to the area of the Tarim Basin around the 2nd century CE, as seen in Serindian art and wooden architectural remains. It then was adopted by China between the 4th and 6th century, where it is found on tiles and ceramics, and was then transmitted to Japan where it is found quite literally in the decoration of the roof tiles of Japanese Buddhist temples from around the 7th century.\n\nThe clearest one are from the 7th century Nara temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, but essentially remain to this day in the roof tile decorations of many Japanese traditional-style buildings.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "761487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=761487", "title": "South Indian culture", "text": "South Indian culture\n\nSouth Indian culture refers to the culture of the South Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana. South Indian culture though with its visible differences forms an important part of the Indian culture. The South Indian Culture is essentially the celebration of the eternal universe through the celebration of the beauty of the body and motherhood. It is exemplified through its dance, clothing, and sculptures.\n\nSouth Indian women traditionally wear the saree while the men wear a type of sarong, which could be either a white \"dhoti\" or a colourful \"lungi\" with typical batik patterns. The saree, being an unstitched drape, enhances the shape of the wearer while only partially covering the midriff. In Indian philosophy, the navel of the Supreme Being is considered as the source of life and creativity. Hence by tradition, the stomach and the navel is to be left unconcealed, though the philosophy behind the costume has largely been forgotten. This makes the realization of \"sharira-mandala\", where in \"Angikam bhuvanam yasya\" (the body is your world) unites with the \"shaarira-mandala\" (the whole universe), as expressed in the Natyashastra. These principles of the sari, also hold for other forms of drapes, like the lungi or mundu or panchey (a white lungi with colourful silk borders in kannada), worn by men. The lungi is draped over clockwise or counterclockwise and is tied at the back or fixed just along the waistline. It's sometimes lifted to the knee and tied at the waist leisurely or just held in hand to speed up walking.\n\nTraditionally, South Indian men do not cover their upper body. Sometimes, in a formal situation, a piece of cloth may cover the upper body. Certain temples in South India even ban men from wearing upper-body garments when inside the temple. In Andhra and parts of north Karnataka, men wear kachche panchey where it is tied at back by taking it between legs. A similar pattern is seen in women. All over the peninsular coastal region, men wear coloured lungis and women wear saris in a manner of tying them at the back.\nThe Araimudi (araimuti) () is a small silver metal plate, shaped like a heart or a fig leaf, formerly worn by young Tamil girls on their genitals. \"Arai\" means loin and \"mudi\" means cover. The araimudi is also known as the \"Genital shield\" and an araimudi was mentioned in the \"Guide to the principal exhibits in the Government Museum, Pudukkottai\", by M. S. Chandrasekhar, published in 1966 as being displayed in an exhibit in the Madras Government Museum. \"A Manual of the Salem district in the presidency of Madras, Volume 1\" said \"The children sometimes, to the age of ten years or more, go in a state of nudity, relieved perhaps by a piece of string round the waist which sustains the \"araimudi\" or heart-shaped piece of silver, which calls attention to what it purports to conceal.\" The \"Madras district gazetteers, Volume 1, Part 1\" said 'Little girls, up to the age of about 3, wear nothing but the little heart-shaped piece of silver suspended by a waist-cord (arai- mudi) \" which calls attention to what it purports to conceal.\"' \"Percival's Tamil-English dictionary\", edited by P. Percival defined Araimudi as \"அரைமுடி arai múḍi, A small plate of gold or silver, appended to the girdle of female children, for the sake of decency\". Miron Winslow's dictionary, \"A comprehensive Tamil and English Dictionary of High and Low Tamil\" defined araimudi as \"அரைமுடி, s. A small plate of metal worn by little girls over the private parts.\" The Abbe Dubois book \"Hindu manners, customs and ceremonies\", translated from French and edited by Henry King Beauchamp stated that \"Even the private parts of the children have their own particular decorations. Little girls wear a gold or silver shield or codpiece on which is graven some indecent picture; while a boy's ornament, also of gold or silver, is an exact copy of that member which it is meant to decorate.\" \"Description of the character, manners, and customs of the people of India; and their institutions, religious and civil\", also written by Dubois said \"The children of either sex are likewise ornamented with various trinkets of the same form, though smaller than those of grown persons. They have also some that are peculiar. As all children in India go perfectly naked till they are six or seven years old, the parents, of course, adapt the ornaments to the natural parts of the body. Thus, the girls have a plate of metal suspended so as to conceal, in some measure, their nakedness. The boys, on the other hand, have little bells hung round them, or some similar device of silver or gold, attached to the little belt with which they are girt. Amongst the rest, a particular trinket appears in front, bearing a resemblance to the sexual part of the lad.\" Until the 1960s in the Ampara District of Sri Lanka girls wore the Araimudi.\n\nRice is the staple diet, with fish being an integral component of coastal South Indian meals. Coconut is an important ingredient in Kerala and coastal part of Karnataka of South India, Hyderabadi biryani is also very special in Telangana and other neighbouring states whereas the cuisine in Andhra Pradesh is characterized by the pickles, spicy aromatic curries and the generous use of chili powder. Dosa, Idli, Uttapam etc. are popular throughout the region. Coastal areas like the state of Kerala and the city of Mangalore are known for their seafood. South Indian coffee is generally quite robust, and coffee is a preferred drink throughout the Malabar region. Tamil Nadu is well known for its Idli, Dosa, Pongal, Sambhar, Vada, Puri, which are the common breakfast in Tamil families. Among the Malayalees, Appam, Puttu, Upamav, Malabar biriyani are some of the common dishes. In Karnataka, Bisibele bath, Kara bath, Kesari bath, Raggi mudda, Udin Vada, Bene Masala Dosa, Paper Dosa are some of the common dishes.\n\nThere is a variety of music. It ranges from rural folk music to the sophisticated Indian Classical Music of South India is known as Carnatic music (after \"Carnatic\", the name by which south India was known in the earlier colonial days. Sarang Dev coined south Indian classical music as \"Karnatic\" Music). It includes melodious, mostly devotional, rhythmic and structured music by composers such as Purandara Dasa, Kanaka Dasaru, Tyagaraja, Dikshathar, Shyama Sasthri, and Swati Tirunal. It is difficult to discuss the culture and music of the four states of South India in a single breath. In Tamil Nadu, there is Tamil Pann, which is sung by Oduvars in Temples. They sing the works of famous Tamil Poets like Sambandar, etc. in various panns (another word for raagas).\n\nThe main instrument that is used in south Indian Hindu temples is the (nadaswaram) It is said to have been created when the very first temple was established in South India. The nadaswaram and the (thavil) were played together in South Indian temples to create a periya melam ensemble. Because of its harsh tone, periya melam is not favored by many Europeans, but to South India, it is a sound of pride and majesty. For many temple traditions, periya melam is necessary for worshippers to feel a spiritual presence. Periya melam is used to play for daily rituals inside the temples and annual rituals outside and around temples.Terada, Yoshitaka. \"Temple Music Traditions in Hindu South India: \"Periya Melam\" and its Performance Practice.\" Asian Music 39.2 (2009): 108-51. ProQuest. Web. 24 Sep. 2013.\n\nThe South Indian culture is celebrated in the elaborate dance forms of South India: Koodiyattam, Bharatanatyam, Oyilattam, Karakattam, Kuchipudi, Kathakali, Thirayattam, Theyyam, Bhuta Kola, Ottamthullal, Oppana, Kerala Natanam, Mohiniaattam and Yakshagana. Thirayattam is a Ritualistic Performing art of South Malabar region in Kerala state. The Bharatanatyam is the celebration of the eternal universe through the celebration of the beauty of the body. This is done through its tenets of having a perfectly erect posture, a straight and pout curving stomach, a well rounded and proportionate body mass to the body structure, very long hair and curvaceous hips. These tenets bring to life the philosophy of Natyashastra, ‘Angikam bhuvanam yasya’ (The body is your world). This is elaborated in the \"araimandi\" posture, wherein the performer assumes a half sitting position with the knees turned sideways, with a very erect posture. In this fundamental posture of the Bharatanatyam dance, the distance between the head and the navel becomes equal to that between the earth and the navel. In a similar way the distance between the outstretched right arm to the outstretched left arm becomes equal to the distance between the head and the feet, thus representing the \"Natyapurusha\", the embodiment of life and creation.\n\nSouth India boasts of having two enchanting styles of rock architecture, the \"pure Dravida\" style of Tamil Nadu and the \"Vesara\" style (also called \"Karnata Dravida\" style) present in Karnataka. The inspirational temple sculptures of Mahabalipuram, Tanjore, Hampi, Badami, Pattadakal, Aihole, Belur, Halebidu, Lakkundi, Shravanabelagola, Madurai and the mural paintings of Travancore and Lepakshi temples, also stand as a testament to South Indian culture. The paintings of Raja Ravi Varma are considered classic renditions of many themes of South Indian life and mythology. There are several examples of Kerala Mural paintings in the Mattancherry Palace and the Shiva kshetram at Ettamanoor. South India is home, as of April 2006, to 5 of the 26 World Heritage-listed sites in India.\n\nSculptures became one of the finest medium of South Indian expression after the human form of dance. In this medium it was possible to etch the three-dimensional form in time. The traditional South Indian sculptor starts his sculpture of the divinities from the navel which is always represented unclothed by the sari. A koshta or grid of the sculpture would show the navel to be right at the centre of the sculpture, representing the source of the union of the finite body and the infinite universe.\nSculptures adorn many of the temples around the complexes and also inside them. They are also depiction of dance steps of various stylizations and have served to preserve dance forms and revive it.\nSouth India has a literary tradition reaching back over two thousand years. The first known literature of South India are the poetic Sangams, which were written in Tamil around two to one and a half thousand years ago. The Kannada classic \"Kavirajamarga\", written in 850 CE by King Amoghavarsha I, makes references to Kannada literature of King Durvinita in early sixth century CE. Tamil Buddhist commentators of the tenth century CE, \"Nemrinatham\" makes references to Kannada literature of fourth century CE Distinct Malayalam and Telugu literary traditions developed in the following centuries. The artistic expressions of the South Indian people show their admiration of the magnificence of nature and its rhythms. Some of the works include \"Silappadhikaram\" by Ilango Adigal, \"Tholkappiam\" written by Tholkappiar, Thiruvalluvar’s \"Thirukural\", Kumaravyasa's \"Karnata Bharata Katamanjari\", Pampa's \"Vikramarjuna Vijaya\", \"Andhra Maha Bharatamu\" by the three poets namely Nannaya, Tikkana and Errana, \"Shiva Sharana\" by Basavanna and Akka Mahadevi's \"Vachanas\". In South Indian literature and philosophy, women are considered very powerful. A married woman is regarded as auspicious, her shakti or mother-feminine power, protects and empowers her husband and their children. Contemporary Kannada writers have received eight Jnanapith awards which is the highest for any Indian language.\n\nThe main spiritual traditions of South India include both Shaivite and Vaishnavite branches of Hinduism, although Buddhist and Jain philosophies had been influential several centuries earlier (recent studies suggest at least the Shaivite branch of Hinduism was present in Southern India before the arrival of Buddhism and Jainism as Ellalan a Tamil King who invaded Sri Lanka in the year 205 BCE is identified by Sinhalese Buddhists as a Shaivite). Shravanabelagola in Karnataka is a popular pilgrimage center for Jains. Christianity has flourished in coastal South India from the times of St. Thomas the Apostle who came to Kerala in 52 AD (the arrival of Saint Thomas may very well be a fictitious account as no historical evidence supports it.)and established the Syrian Christian tradition today called Saint Thomas Christians or Nasranis. There is a large Muslim community in South India, particularly in the Malabar Coast, which can trace its roots to the ancient maritime trade between Kerala and Omanis and other Arabs. Madras and Cochin is home to one of the oldest Cochin Jews and Paradesi Jews in the world who are supposed to have arrived in the Malabar coast during the time of King Solomon. The oldest surviving Jewish synagogue in the Commonwealth of Nations is the Paradesi Synagogue in Kochi, Kerala.\n\n\n"}

It provides a structured and transparent evaluation of the importance of outcomes of alternative management strategies, acknowledgment of patients and the public values and preferences, and comprehensive criteria for downgrading and upgrading certainty in evidence. It has important implications for those summarizing evidence for systematic reviews, health technology assessments, and clinical practice guidelines as well as other decision makers.\n\nJudgments about evidence and recommendations in healthcare are complex. Healthcare evidence and subsequent recommendations leave decision makers with differing degrees of certainty in that evidence. Sources of evidence range from small laboratory studies or case reports to well-designed large randomized controlled trials that have minimized bias to a great extent. The GRADE began in the year 2000 as a collaboration of methodologists, guideline developers, biostatisticians, clinicians, public health scientists and other interested members. GRADE developed and implemented a common, transparent and sensible approach to grading the quality of evidence (also known as certainty in evidence or confidence in effect estimates) and strength of recommendations in healthcare \nThe GRADE approach separates recommendations following from an evaluation of the evidence as strong or weak. A recommendations to use, or not use an option (e.g. an intervention), should be based on the trade-offs between desirable consequences of following a recommendation on the one hand, and undesirable consequences on the other (Table 2). If desirable consequences outweigh undesirable consequences, decision makers will recommend an option and vice versa. The uncertainty associated with the trade-off between the desirable and undesirable consequences will determine the strength of recommendations. The criteria that determine this balance of consequences are listed in Table 2. Furthermore, it provides decision-makers (e.g. clinicians, other health care providers, patients and policy makers) with a guide to using those recommendations in clinical practice, public health and policy. To achieve simplicity, the GRADE approach classifies the quality of evidence in one of four levels—high, moderate, low, and very low (Table 1).\n\nTable 1. Quality of evidence and definitions \n\n\"(modified from Balshem et. al.)\"\n\nThe GRADE working group has developed a software application that facilitates the use of the approach, allows the development of summary tables and contains the GRADE handbook. The software is free for non-profit organizations and is available at http://www.gradepro.org\nThe GRADE approach to assess the certainty in evidence is widely applicable, including to questions about diagnosis, prognosis, network meta-analysis and public health.\n\nOver 100 organizations (including the World Health Organization, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the Canadian Task Force for Preventive Health Care, the Colombian Ministry of Health, among others) have endorsed and/or are using GRADE to evaluate the quality of evidence and strength of health care recommendations.

{"id": "19184052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19184052", "title": "The Hapa Project", "text": "The Hapa Project\n\nThe Hapa Project is a multiracial identity art project created by American artist Kip Fulbeck. The project embodies a range of mediums, including a published book, traveling photographic exhibition, satellite community presentations, and online communities.\n\nFulbeck began the project in 2001, traveling the country photographing over 1200 volunteer subjects who self-identified as Hapa (defined for the project as mixed ethnic heritage with partial roots in Asian and/or Pacific Islander ancestry) Each individual was photographed in a similar minimalist style (directly head-on, unclothed from the shoulders up, and without jewelry, glasses, excess make-up, or purposeful expression). After being photographed, participants chose their own racial/ethnic terms to describe themselves, then responded to the question \"What are you?\" in their own handwriting. The photographs, self-descriptions, and handwritten responses were then combined and displayed as a collection.\n\nOver 1200 volunteer participants were photographed at dozens of shoots throughout California and Hawaii, as well as Illinois, New York, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Hapa Project was created to promote awareness and recognition of the millions of multiracial/multiethnic individuals of Asian/Pacific Islander descent in the U.S; to give voice to multiracial people and previously ignored ethnic groups; to dispel myths of exoticism, hybrid vigor and racial homogeneity; to foster positive identity formation and self-image in multiracial children; and to encourage solidarity and empowerment within the multiracial/Hapa community. Fulbeck also notes that a main objective \"... was to make the book I wish I owned when I was a kid. I never knew anyone else like me, going through things I went through, not fitting in, always having to choose sides ... Identity is a personal process and I’m adamant that it should be a personal decision, not one made by a community, a government or others.\" \n\nFulbeck states that despite its utilization of common racial classifications, The Hapa Project is fundamentally a project about identity rather than a project about race: \"It's about identity using race as a starting point.\" He argues that race in itself is not biologically determined, but socially created: \"For the record, race is not a scientifically sound assumption. For example, there is no DNA difference between human beings. We are all African. Biologically, race does not exist. It is a social and cultural construct ... The U.S. is a country with a long history of social genocide (Native Americans, African slavery, etc.) and this was all due to the seeming differences we attributed to race. Yes, it is very convenient to categorize people according to race. It is also extremely inaccurate, however.\" \n\nThe use of a clinical photographic style combined with the listing of the subject's ethnic heritage alongside their image visually quotes from various pseudo-scientific 18th and 19th century racial studies of Carl Linnaeus, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, and Arthur de Gobineau [See: Spickard, Paul, \"Almost All Aliens\", Routledge, New York, NY 2007] However, Fulbeck's decision to have the subjects self-designate their ethnicity and to include their individual handwritten statements counters this methodology, giving ownership and responsibility to the subjects themselves. As historian Paul Spickard writes, \"Kip Fulbeck is using the pictures to provoke and encourage his readers. He is using the old form, but with exactly opposite content.\" [See: Fulbeck, Kip, Part Asian, 100% Hapa, Chronicle Books, San Francisco 2006, p. 261]\n\nThe project also plays upon and critiques the official photographs each person has taken for their driver's licenses, passports and other forms of identification.\n\nA further strategy aimed at diminishing the power dynamic between photographer/subject was to have each participant choose their own image, with the option of re-photographing them if they desired. Fulbeck states, \"... every participant not only got to write their statement the way they wanted to, they also got to pick their own image. A camera is a tremendously powerful tool and the power dynamic between photographer and subject is palpable. For this reason, I wanted to give some of the power back to the subjects. It was never going to be completely democratic – it is, after all, my concept, my project, and my design – but there are some strategies you can employ to make it less unilateral. Everyone got to see their image and choose to keep it or erase it and shoot again.\" One participant was re-photographed 27 times.\n\nNumerous schools and community organizations have created similar projects inspired by Fulbeck's work.\n\nThe Hapa Project publicly premiered in 2006 at the Japanese American National Museum with a 5-month solo exhibition entitled \"kip fulbeck: part asian, 100% hapa.\" The work has also exhibited at Space180 Gallery (San Francisco), Mandeville Gallery (New York), The Field Museum, University of North Carolina, Oakland University, Northern Arizona University, Santa Clara University, and Woodward Academy, among others. Sixteen images from the series are included in the Science Museum of Minnesota's exhibition \"Race: Are We So Different?\" currently touring nationally.\n\nMany of the exhibitions include a participatory component where visitors can take part in the project by having their picture taken and writing an individual statement.\n\nThe project has received both national and international news coverage, being featured on CNN, MTV, PBS, NPR, and Voice of America. Major newspapers covering the project include The Los Angeles Times, Orange County Register, and Kyoto Journal. It has also been featured on dozens of websites exploring race and identity in the U.S.\n\nA book based on the project entitled \"Part Asian, 100% Hapa\" was published by Chronicle Books in 2006. It features a foreword by musician Sean Lennon and an afterword by historian Paul Spickard.\n\nThe book includes portraits and statements from approximately 10% of the overall project participants. Fulbeck has discussed the difficulties in selecting these images from the overall pool, as well the problematic of selecting a single image for the book cover. He also has written about the conscious decision to dispel stereotypes of Hapa people all being conventionally attractive.\n\nFulbeck cites photographer Jim Goldberg and comic artist Lynda Barry as specifically influential to the creation of the project. Lynda Barry also participated in the project and is included in \"Part Asian, 100% Hapa.\" Fulbeck also credits historian Paul Spickard as a major influence, particularly his book \"Mixed Blood: Intermarriage & Ethnic: Intermarriage And Ethnic Identity In Twentieth Century America\" (University of Wisconsin Press, 1991) [See: Fulbeck, Kip, \"Part Asian, 100% Hapa\", Chronicle Books, San Francisco 2006, pp. 8, 55, 259].\n\nParticipant names are listed alphabetically in both the photographic exhibition and book (without index to individual images). Fulbeck chose participant anonymity both for the safety of the children and as a thematic strategy. \"...I wanted participants to have as blank a slate as possible to work with, to not be burdened by any pre-existing identifiers. It’s interesting with celebrities, because celebrities without their gear – their look or environment or entourage – don’t look like celebrities. They look like people. And that’s what I wanted. I could photograph Cher this way and she’d look like a regular person.\" \n\nCelebrities in the project include Lynda Barry, Wuv Bernardo, Asia Carrera, Karen David, Amy Hill, Sean Lennon, Liz Masakayan, Greg Pak, Sonny Sandoval, and Sandra Tsing Loh.\n\nTwo-thirds of the project volunteers were part Japanese-American. An overwhelming majority of participants were female, including some shoots where women outnumbered men 20:1.\n\nFulbeck followed \"Part Asian, 100% Hapa\" with the publication of \"Permanence: Tattoo Portraits by Kip Fulbeck\" in 2008 and \"Mixed: Portraits of Multiracial Kids\" in 2010 (both by Chronicle Books). Both books also had accompanying solo exhibitions. A major speaker on the college circuit, Fulbeck has spoken on The Hapa Project at hundreds of campuses throughout the U.S. He is represented by The Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles.\n\n"}
{"id": "35935308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35935308", "title": "The Rains of Castamere", "text": "The Rains of Castamere\n\n\"The Rains of Castamere\", sometimes referred to as \"The Red Wedding,\" is the ninth and penultimate episode of the third season of HBO's fantasy television series \"Game of Thrones\", and the 29th episode of the series. The episode was written by executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by David Nutter. It aired on .\n\nThe episode is centered on the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey, one of the most memorable events of the book series, commonly called \"The Red Wedding\", during which Robb Stark and his banner-men are massacred. Other storylines include Bran Stark's group having to separate, Jon Snow's loyalties being tested, and Daenerys plotting her invasion of the city of Yunkai. The title is a song belonging to the Lannister family, whose lyrics foreshadow the Red Wedding and which is played by the band at the wedding right before the slaughter begins.\n\nThis episode earned Benioff and Weiss a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series.\n\nThis episode marks the final appearance of Richard Madden (Robb Stark), Oona Chaplin (Talisa Stark) and Michelle Fairley (Catelyn Stark).\n\nNorth of the Wall, Sam and Gilly continue their march south. Sam tells Gilly he plans for them to cross the Wall using the entrance at the Nightfort, an abandoned castle along the Wall.\n\nSouth of the Wall, Bran and his group take shelter in an abandoned mill. Nearby, Jon and the wildling party raid an elderly horse breeder's home, taking his horses and gold while the old man flees. While in the mill, Bran and Jojen Reed discuss how they plan to cross the Wall, before Meera spots the old horse breeder riding nearby. After the old man is captured by the wildlings, Hodor—scared by the thunder—begins yelling, which threatens to give away their location to the wildlings. Bran uses his warg abilities to enter Hodor's mind and knocks him out.\n\nOutside, Tormund moves to kill the old man, but Orell tells him to have Jon do it instead to prove his loyalty. Jon is ultimately unable to kill the innocent man, and instead Ygritte kills the man with an arrow. Realizing where Jon's loyalties lie, Tormund orders his men to kill him, but Jon manages to defeat them. As Ygritte moves to defend him, Jon deliberately knocks her to the ground, allowing Tormund to hold her down and prevent her from getting killed, while he battles with Orell. Bran enters the mind of Summer, his direwolf, and aids Jon. While the wolves hold off the other wildlings, Jon kills Orell, who wargs into an eagle, which briefly attacks Jon, scarring the latter's face. After Jon fights off the eagle, he is able to steal a horse and escape, leaving Ygritte and heading back to the Wall. At night, Bran asks Osha to take Rickon to Last Hearth, the home of the Umber family, and they depart shortly after.\n\nPlanning their invasion of Yunkai, Daario tells Daenerys and her knights about a rear gate to the city, through which they can sneak in and open the main gate for her army. Ser Jorah is suspicious of Daario and his plan, but comes around when Daenerys seeks Grey Worm's opinion. When night falls, Daario, Jorah, and Grey Worm arrive at the gate. Daario enters ahead of them, posing as a still loyal Second Son commander. Shortly after being let inside the city, he signals Jorah and Grey Worm to follow him. Soon, they are ambushed by a group of Yunkai's slave soldiers, and though largely outnumbered, manage to kill them and accomplish the mission. The group returns to Daenerys, and tells her that she is now in control of the city.\n\nAt camp, Catelyn counsels her son Robb, the King in the North, about his planned alliance with Lord Walder Frey and his planned assault on Casterly Rock, the homeland of the Lannisters. The Stark host soon arrives at the Twins, castle homeland of the Freys, where they are given bread and salt, a symbol of the \"guest right\": a guarantee of safety when under another lord's roof. Robb makes an apology to both the sarcastic Walder Frey and his daughters. Walder accepts the apology but insists on inspecting Talisa, the woman for whom Robb broke his vow. Nearby, Arya, though still a captive of Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane, journeys to the Twins to reunite with her mother and brother. When they come upon a trader and his cart, Clegane knocks him out and moves to kill him, but Arya manages to dissuade him, and he instead steals the cart of food.\n\nAt night, Walder walks his daughter Roslin down the aisle to her future husband Edmure Tully, who is pleasantly surprised by her beauty. They are married shortly after, and the celebration begins. At the feast, Walder calls for the bedding ceremony, and the couple are taken to their chamber. After they leave, Lothar Frey closes the banquet hall doors, and the Frey bards begin playing \"The Rains of Castamere\", a Lannister cautionary song, both of which arouse Catelyn's suspicions. Using the food cart as their reason for being at the Twins, The Hound and Arya arrive at the wedding. They are turned away at the gates, but Arya sneaks in.\n\nCatelyn notices Roose Bolton wearing chainmail under his robes, which confirms Catelyn's suspicions that they have been betrayed. Just as Walder signals his men to attack the Starks' men, Catelyn tries to warn Robb, but before he can react, Lothar repeatedly stabs the pregnant Talisa in the abdomen, killing her and her unborn child. Robb is then shot by crossbows, and the massacre of his bannermen begins. Arya, having snuck past the gate, witnesses Frey men kill Stark soldiers and Robb's direwolf, Grey Wind. She is saved by The Hound, who knocks her unconscious and carries her out of the castle. Catelyn, although wounded by a crossbow bolt, holds Walder's young wife, Joyeuse, hostage with a knife and demands that Robb be allowed to leave. Walder refuses, and Roose Bolton stabs Robb in the heart, delivering Jaime's message from Harrenhal: \"The Lannisters send their regards.\" Catelyn screams and kills Joyeuse in retaliation, before Frey's son Black Walder cuts Catelyn's throat.\n\n\"The Rains of Castamere\" was written by executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, based on George R. R. Martin's original work from his novel \"A Storm of Swords\". The episode adapts content from chapters 41 to 43 and 50 to 53 (Bran III, Jon V, Daenerys IV, Catelyn VI, Arya X, Catelyn VII, and Arya XI).\n\nThe episode includes one of the most important plot turns of the series: the betrayal and assassination of the Stark forces during a marriage ceremony in what came to be known as the \"Red Wedding\". The event culminates in Roose Bolton delivering Jaime Lannister's message from \"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\", before killing Robb. This tragic turn of events had a profound impact on Benioff and Weiss in their first read of the novels and it was the scene that convinced them to attempt to obtain the rights for a television series.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin conceived The Red Wedding during the earliest stages of the planning of his saga, when he was envisioning a trilogy with The Red Wedding as one of the climactic events at the end of the first of the three books. Martin was inspired by a couple of events in Scottish history. One of them was the 15th century historical event known as the \"Black Dinner\", where the Scottish king invited the chieftains of the powerful Clan Douglas to a feast at Edinburgh Castle. A black bull's head, the symbol of death, was served as the last course of the dinner while a single drum was playing in the background, and the Douglases were murdered. Another event from which the author drew inspiration was the 1692 Massacre of Glencoe, where Clan MacDonald hosted the Campbell Clan who killed thirty-eight of their hosts overnight.\n\nMartin has said The Red Wedding was the hardest thing he has ever written. He explained that he always tries to put himself in the skin of his characters when writing from their perspective, and develops bonds with them. He even felt attached to the minor characters killed during the massacre. It was so painful for him that he skipped the chapter and continued writing, and only when the rest of the book was finished, he \"forced himself\" to come back to the dreaded scene. In 2012, at ComicCon he even joked that \"he will visit a country with no television when the episode goes on air\".\n\nMartin also said he killed off Robb because he believed the audience would assume that the story was about Ned Stark's heir avenging his death and wished to keep them guessing. He later suggested Talisa — whose counterpart Jeyne Westerling was not killed in the books — died so Robb's heir could not avenge his death.\n\nWill Champion, the drummer and backing vocalist of the band Coldplay, has a cameo appearance as one of the musicians who play at the wedding.\n\n\"The Rains of Castamere\" premiered to 5.22 million viewers and received a 2.8 ratings in adults 18–49. The second airing was viewed by 1.08 million people, bringing total viewership for the night to 6.30 million. In the United Kingdom, the episode was viewed by 1.013 million viewers, making it the highest-rated broadcast that week. It also received 0.112 million timeshift viewers.\n\nThe episode was widely praised by critics and cited as one of the best of the series. Rotten Tomatoes, a prominent review aggregator, surveyed 21 reviews of the installment and judged 100% of them to be positive with an average score of 9.9 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The most unforgettable episode of Game of Thrones thus far, 'The Rains of Castamere' (or as it shall forever be known, 'The Red Wedding') packs a dramatic wallop that feels as exquisitely shocking as it does ultimately inevitable.\" The majority of the comments were directed at the massacre at the end of the episode, where praise was especially given to Michelle Fairley's performance, leading to the disappointment of many critics when she was not nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. IGN's Matt Fowler gave the episode a perfect 10/10, calling it \"an exquisitely awful event that managed to out-do the unpredictable and horrifying death of Ned Stark back in Season 1\". Fowler also said he believed that the episode's depiction of the Red Wedding was more powerful than its depiction in \"A Song of Ice and Fire\".\n\nWriting for \"The A.V. Club\", both David Sims and Todd VanDerWerff gave the episode an \"A\" grade. Sims (writing for people who have not read the novels) expressed shock at the deaths of several main characters, writing, \"I don’t think I’ve really processed what I just watched\". VanDerWerff, who reviews the episodes for people who have read the novels, wrote \"If [the reader] doesn’t terribly want to deal with the thought of the deaths of Catelyn and Robb, well, he or she can read that much more quickly. Or he or she can read that much more slowly if there’s a need to process the emotions more fully. On TV, you can't really do that.\" Reviewing for \"Forbes\", Erik Kain called the episode \"one of the best episodes of HBO's dark drama yet\", and noted \"there was a deeper sense of tragedy knowing [Robb] also lost his unborn child\". Sean Collins of the \"Rolling Stone\" also praised the episode, and commented on the unusual step the show took in ending one of its central conflicts. Sarah Hughes of \"The Guardian\" highlighted the decision to kill Talisa, writing that her \"heartbreaking end was unbearable\".\n\nFor its 65th anniversary, \"TV Guide\" picked \"The Rains of Castamere\" as the third best episode of the 21st century.\n\nThe episode was also notable for the intense and emotional response it pulled from viewers, many of whom were unaware of what was about to transpire and had their reactions filmed by people who had read the book on which it was based. This led to George R. R. Martin giving his personal analysis of the reactions, which he stated were on par with the responses he received from readers of \"A Storm of Swords\".\n\n\n"}

Tohunga include expert priests, healers, navigators, carvers, builders, teachers and advisors. \"A tohunga may have also been the head of a whanau but quite often was also a rangatira and an ariki\". The equivalent and cognate in Hawaiian culture is \"kahuna\".\n\nThere are many classes of tohunga (Best 1924:166) including:\n\n\nEach tohunga was a gifted spiritual leader and possessed the natural ability of communicating between the spiritual and temporal realms through karakia (prayers), pātere (chants) or performing waiata (songs) that had been passed down to them by tohunga before them. However, their rites were mainly in the specific fields in which they practiced, as outlined above.\n\nTohunga held knowledge of most spiritual and temporal rites and knowledge in general were passed down through many generations by oral communication at wananga (places of learning/schools). Tools they also used were taonga pūoro for the purpose of calling on divine intervention or assistance from the gods.\n\nAlthough Māori had high respect for the knowledge and skills of tohunga, there was a darker side too, and European settlers often held a very poor opinion of them, something which led to the Tohunga Suppression Act 1907.\n\nMany tohunga declined to pass on their oral traditions after the Act was enforced in New Zealand, leaving Māori people bereft of much of their traditional base, beliefs and practices; at the same time as it hastened assimilation. The Act was repealed in 1962, but by this time, much of the language and traditions had been either corrupted or lost, but a few kaumatua and kuia continued to orally communicate their knowledge through the generations.\n\nOne observation to the survival of \"tohungatanga\" was the insignificance of the \"female tohunga‟ perspective and yet women were the \"most powerful tohunga\" as they had a direct lineage and link to Te Ira Atua (spiritual realm of the gods) and are a class that have been ignored in any literature until now.\n\nTapu was one of the most deeply ingrained beliefs and religious customs of the Māori. The word tapu may be translated as sacred or forbidden, but the Māori tapu has a host of variations. There was a personal tapu and local tapu; tapu of one kind or another faced the Māori everywhere. It often served a purpose similar to some of the Jewish laws of prohibition and quarantine.\n\nTohunga were imbued with the mysterious essences of the tapu because of their knowledge of ancient and potent karakia, religious ceremonies and their office as mediums of communication with the dread atua. All ariki also had a strong personal tapu which prevented any common person eating out of the same food basket or using anything belonging to the chief.\n\nThe remains of the sacred dead and all connected therewith were highly tapu and anyone who had been engaged in handling the dead or bones of the dead would be extremely tapu and would not dare to touch food with the hands. Consequently, such persons had to be fed in the manner shown in the painting here. This was painted from life at an old-time pa (village) in the Wanganui district. The outer pallisaded fence of the pa, with its roughly carved posts, usually totara, is shown in the background. The tohunga is kneeling on mats in front of a raupo whare (house) in a remote corner of the settlement.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "304572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304572", "title": "Tonality", "text": "Tonality\n\nTonality is the arrangement of pitches and/or chords of a musical work in a hierarchy of perceived relations, stabilities, attractions and directionality. In this hierarchy, the single pitch or triadic chord with the greatest stability is called the tonic. The root of the tonic chord forms the name given to the key; so in the key of C major, the note C is both the tonic of the scale and the root of the tonic chord (which is C–E–G). Simple folk music songs often start and end with the tonic note. The most common use of the term \"is to designate the arrangement of musical phenomena around a referential tonic in European music from about 1600 to about 1910\" . Contemporary classical music from 1910 to the 2000s may practice or avoid any sort of tonality—but harmony in almost all Western popular music remains tonal. Harmony in jazz includes many but not all tonal characteristics of the European common practice period, sometimes known as \"classical music\".\n\n\"All harmonic idioms in popular music are tonal, and none is without function\" .\nTonality is an organized system of tones (e.g., the tones of a major or minor scale) in which one tone (the tonic) becomes the central point for the remaining tones. The other tones in a tonal piece are all defined in terms of their relationship to the tonic. In tonality, the tonic (tonal center) is the tone of complete relaxation and stability, the target toward which other tones lead . The cadence (coming to rest point) in which the dominant chord or dominant seventh chord resolves to the tonic chord plays an important role in establishing the tonality of a piece. \"Tonal music is music that is \"unified\" and \"dimensional\". Music is unified if it is exhaustively referable to a precompositional system generated by a single constructive principle derived from a basic scale-type; it is dimensional if it can nonetheless be distinguished from that precompositional ordering\" .\n\nThe term \"tonalité\" originated with Alexandre-Étienne and was borrowed by François-Joseph Fétis in 1840 (; ; ; ; ). According to Carl Dahlhaus, however, the term \"tonalité\" was only coined by Castil-Blaze in 1821 (; ). Although Fétis used it as a general term for a system of musical organization and spoke of \"types de tonalités\" rather than a single system, today the term is most often used to refer to major–minor tonality, the system of musical organization of the common practice period. Major-minor tonality is also called \"harmonic tonality\" (in the title of Carl , translating the German \"harmonische Tonalität\"), \"diatonic tonality\", \"common practice tonality\", \"functional tonality\", or just \"tonality\".\n\nAt least eight distinct senses of the word \"tonality\" (and corresponding adjective, \"tonal\"), some mutually exclusive, have been identified : \n\nFirst, the word tonality may describe any systematic organization of pitch phenomena in any music at all, including pre-17th century western music as well as much non-western music, such as music based on the slendro and pelog pitch collections of Indonesian gamelan, or employing the modal nuclei of the Arabic maqam or the Indian raga system.\n\nThis sense also applies to the tonic/dominant/subdominant harmonic harmonic constellations in the theories of Jean-Philippe Rameau as well as the 144 basic transformations of twelve-tone technique. By the middle of the 20th century, it had become \"evident that triadic structure does not necessarily generate a tone center, that non-triadic harmonic formations may be made to function as referential elements, and that the assumption of a twelve-tone complex does not preclude the existence of tone centers\".\n\nFor the composer and theorist George Perle, tonality is not \"a matter of 'tone-centeredness', whether based on a 'natural' hierarchy of pitches derived from the overtone series or an 'artificial' pre compositional ordering of the pitch material; nor is it essentially connected to the kinds of pitch structures one finds in traditional diatonic music\" . This sense (like some of the others) is susceptible to ideological employment, as Schoenberg, did by relying on the idea of a progressive development in musical resources \"to compress divergent \"fin-de-siècle\" compositional practices into a single historical lineage in which his own music brings one historical era to a close and begins the next.\" From this point of view, twelve-tone music could be regarded \"either as the natural and inevitable culmination of an organic motivic process (Webern) or as a historical \"Aufhebung\" (Adorno), the dialectical synthesis of late Romantic motivic practice on the one hand with a musical sublimation of tonality as pure system on the other\" .\n\nIn another sense, tonality means any rational and self-contained theoretical arrangement of musical pitches, existing prior to any concrete embodiment in music.\n\nFor example, \"Sainsbury, who had Choron translated into English in 1825, rendered the first occurrence of tonalité as a 'system of modes' before matching it with the neologism 'tonality'. While tonality qua system constitutes a theoretical (and thus imaginative) abstraction from actual music, it is often hypostatized in musicological discourse, converted from a theoretical structure into a musical reality. In this sense, it is understood as a Platonic form or prediscursive musical essence that suffuses music with intelligible sense, which exists before its concrete embodiment in music, and can thus be theorized and discussed apart from actual musical contexts\" .\n\nA third sense is a term to contrast with \"modal\" and \"atonal\", the term tonality is used to imply that tonal music is discontinuous as a form of cultural expression from modal music (before 1600) on the one hand and atonal music (after 1910) on the other.\n\nIn some literature, a fourth sense of tonality is a generic term applied to pre-modern music, referring to the eight modes of the Western church, implying that important historical continuities underlie music before and after the emergence of musical modernism around 1600, with the difference between \"tonalité ancienne\" (before 1600) and \"tonalité moderne\" (after 1600) being one of emphasis rather than of kind.\n\nFifth, in a general way, tonality can refer to a wide variety of musical phenomena (harmonies, cadential formulae, harmonic progressions, melodic gestures, formal categories) as arranged or understood in relation to a referential tonic.\n\nIn a sixth, slightly different sense to the one above, tonality can also be used to refer to musical phenomena perceived or preinterpreted in terms of the categories of tonal theories.\n\nThis is a psychophysical sense, where for example \"listeners tend to hear a given pitch as, for instance, an A above middle C, an augmented 4th above E, the minor 3rd in an F minor triad, a dominant in relation to D, or (where the caret designates a scale degree) in G major rather than a mere acoustical frequency, in this case 440 Hz\" .\n\nSeventh, the word tonality has more recently been used by amateur musicians and in popular music as a synonym for \"key\"—in this sense meaning \"keyness\"\n\nThis is the most common usage, referring to the arrangement of musical phenomena around a referential tonic, as found in European music from about 1600 to about 1910, using two modal genera, major and minor\n\nEighth, there is a loose assortment of ideas associated with the term.\n\n\"Tonal harmonies must always include the third of the chord\" .\n\nIn major and minor harmonies, the perfect fifth is often implied and understood by the listener even if it is not present. To function as a tonic, a chord must be either a major or a minor triad. Dominant function requires a major-quality triad with a root a perfect fifth above the affiliated tonic and containing the leading tone of the key. This dominant triad must be preceded by a chord progression that establishes the dominant as the penultimate goal of a motion that is completed by moving on to the tonic. In this final dominant-to-tonic progression, the leading tone normally ascends by semitone motion to the tonic scale degree (; ; ; ). A dominant seventh chord always consist of a major triad with an added minor seventh above the root. To achieve this in minor keys, the seventh scale degree must be raised to create a major triad on the dominant (; ).\n\nDavid considers key, consonance and dissonance (relaxation and tension, respectively), and hierarchical relationships the three most basic concepts in tonality.\n\nCarl Dahlhaus lists the characteristic schemata of tonal harmony, \"typified in the compositional formulas of the 16th and early 17th centuries,\" as the \"complete cadence\" I–ii–V–I, I–IV–V–I, I–IV–I–V–I; the circle of fifths progression I–IV–vii°–iii–vi–ii–V–I; and the major–minor parallelism: minor v–i–VII–III equals major iii–vi–V–I; or minor III–VII–i–v equals major I–V–vi–iii. The last of these progressions is characterized by \"retrograde\" harmonic motion.\n\nThe consonance and dissonance of different intervals plays an important role in establishing the tonality of a piece or section in common practice music and popular music. For example, for a simple folk music song in the key of C Major, almost all of the triadic chords in the song will be Major or minor chords which are stable and consonant (e.g., in the key of C Major, commonly-used chords will included D minor, F Major, G Major, etc.). The most commonly used dissonant chord in a pop song context is the dominant seventh chord built on the fifth scale degree; in the key of C Major, this would be a G dominant seventh chord, or G7 chord, which contains the pitches G, B, D and F. This dominant seventh chord contains a dissonant tritone interval between the notes B and F. In pop music, the listener will expect this tritone to be resolved to a consonant, stable chord (in this case, typically a C Major cadence (coming to rest point) or a deceptive cadence to an A minor chord).\n\n\"The larger portion of the world's folk and art music can be categorized as tonal,\" as long as the definition is as follows: \"Tonal music gives priority to a single tone or tonic. In this kind of music all the constituent tones and resulting tonal relationships are heard and identified relative to their tonic\" . In this sense, \"All harmonic idioms in popular music are tonal, and none is without function\" . However, \"within the continuing hegemony of tonality there is evidence for a relatively separate tradition of genuine folk musics, which do not operate completely or even mainly according to the assumptions or rules of tonality. … throughout the reign of tonality there seem to have existed subterranean folk musical traditions organized on principles different from tonality, and often modal: Celtic songs and blues are obvious examples\" .\n\nAccording to Allan , \"part of the heritage of rock lies within common-practice tonality\" but, because the leading-note/tonic relationship is \"axiomatic to the definition of common-practice tonality\", and a fundamental feature of rock music's identity is the absence of a diatonic leading tone, the harmonic practices of rock music, \"while sharing many features with classical tonality, are nonetheless distinct\" . Power chords are especially problematic when trying to apply classical functional tonality to certain varieties of popular music. Genres such as heavy metal, new wave, punk rock, and grunge music \"took power chords into new arenas, often with a reduced emphasis on tonal function. These genres are often expressed in two parts—a bass line doubled in fifths, and a single vocal part. Power chord technique was often allied with modal procedure\" .\n\nMuch jazz is tonal, but \"functional tonality in jazz has different properties than that of common-practice classical music. These properties are represented by a unique set of rules dictating the unfolding of harmonic function, voice-leading conventions, and the overall behavior of chord tones and chordal extensions\" .\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau's \"Treatise on Harmony\" (1722) is the earliest effort to explain tonal harmony through a coherent system based on acoustical principles , built upon the functional unit being the triad, with inversions.\n\nThe term \"tonalité\" (tonality) was first used in 1810 by Alexandre Choron in the preface \"Sommaire de l'histoire de la musique\" to the \"Dictionnaire historique des musiciens artistes et amateurs\" (which he published in collaboration with ) to describe the arrangement of the dominant and subdominant above and below the tonic—a constellation that had been made familiar by Rameau. According to Choron, this pattern, which he called \"tonalité moderne\", distinguished modern music's harmonic organization from that of earlier [pre 17th century] music, including \"tonalité des Grecs\" (ancient Greek modes) and \"tonalité ecclésiastique\" (plainchant) (; ). According to Choron, the beginnings of this modern tonality are found in the music of Claudio Monteverdi around the year 1595, but it was more than a century later that the full application of tonal harmony finally supplanted the older reliance on the melodic orientation of the church modes, in the music of the Neapolitan School—most especially that of Francesco Durante .\n\nFrançois-Joseph Fétis developed the concept of \"tonalité\" in the 1830s and 1840s , finally codifying his theory of tonality in 1844, in his \"Traité complet de la théorie et de la pratique de l'harmonie\" (; ). Fétis saw \"tonalité moderne\" as the historically evolving phenomenon with three stages: tonality of \"ordre transitonique\" (\"transitonic order\"), of \"ordre pluritonique\" (\"pluritonic order\") and, finally, \"ordre omnitonique\" (\"omnitonic order\"). The \"transitonic\" phase of tonality he connected with the late Monteverdi. He described his earliest example of \"tonalité moderne\" thus: \"In the passage quoted here from Monteverdi's madrigal (\"Cruda amarilli\", mm. 9–19 and 24–30), one sees a tonality determined by the \"accord parfait\" [root position major chord] on the tonic, by the sixth chord assigned to the chords on the third and seventh degrees of the scale, by the optional choice of the \"accord parfait\" or the sixth chord on the sixth degree, and finally, by the \"accord parfait\" and, above all, by the unprepared seventh chord (with major third) on the dominant\" . Among most subtle representatives of \"pluritonic order\" there were Mozart and Rossini; this stage he saw as the culmination and perfection of \"tonalité moderne\". The romantic tonality of Berlioz and especially Wagner he related to \"omnitonic order\" with its \"insatiable desire for modulation\" . His prophetic vision of the omnitonic order (though he didn't approve it personally) as the way of further development of tonality was a remarkable innovation to historic and theoretic concepts of the 19th century .\n\n\"Tonalité ancienne\" Fetis described as tonality of \"ordre unitonique\" (establishing one key and remaining in that key for the duration of the piece). The principal example of this \"unitonic order\" tonality he saw in the Western plainchant.\n\nFétis believed that tonality, \"tonalité moderne\", was entirely cultural, saying, \"For the elements of music, nature provides nothing but a multitude of tones differing in pitch, duration, and intensity by the greater or least degree ... The conception of the relationships that exist among them is awakened in the intellect, and, by the action of sensitivity on the one hand, and will on the other, the mind coordinates the tones into different series, each of which corresponds to a particular class of emotions, sentiments, and ideas. Hence these series become various types of tonalities.\" \"But one will say, 'What is the principle behind these scales, and what, if not acoustic phenomena and the laws of mathematics, has set the order of their tones?' I respond that this principle is purely metaphysical [anthropological]. We conceive this order and the melodic and harmonic phenomena that spring from it out of our conformation and education.\"\n\nFétis' \"Traité complet\" was very popular. In France alone the book was printed between 1844 and 1903 twenty times. The 1st edition was printed in Paris and Brussels in 1844, the 9th edition was printed in Paris in 1864, and the 20th edition was printed in Paris in 1903. For more bibliographical information, see worldcat.org.\n\nIn contrast, Hugo Riemann believed tonality, \"affinities between tones\" or \"Tonverwandtschaften\", was entirely natural and, following Moritz , that the major third and perfect fifth were the only \"directly intelligible\" intervals, and that I, IV, and V, the tonic, subdominant, and dominant were related by the perfect fifths between their root notes .\n\nIt is in this era that the word \"tonality\" was popularized by Fétis .\n\nTheorists such as Hugo Riemann, and later Edward and others, pushed back the date when modern tonality began, and the cadence began to be seen as the definitive way that a tonality is established in a work of music .\n\nIn the music of some late-Romantic or post-Romantic composers such as Richard Wagner, Hugo Wolf, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Anton Bruckner, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Alexander Scriabin, and others, we find a variety of harmonic and linear procedures that have the effect of weakening functional tonality. These procedures may produce a suspension of tonality or may create a sense of tonal ambiguity, even to the point that at times the sense of tonality is completely lost. Schoenberg described this kind of tonality (with references to the music of Wagner, Mahler, and himself, amongst others) as \"aufgehobene Tonalität\" and \"schwebende Tonalität\" , usually rendered in English as \"suspended\" (\"not in effect\", \"cancelled\") tonality and \"fluctuating\" (\"suspended\", \"not yet decided\") tonality, respectively .\n\nIn the early 20th century, the tonality that had prevailed since the 17th century was seen to have reached a crisis or break down point. Because of the \"...increased use of the ambiguous chords, the less probable harmonic progressions, and the more unusual melodic and rhythmic inflections,\" the syntax of functional harmony loosened to the point where, \"At best, the felt probabilities of the style system had become obscure; at worst, they were approaching a uniformity which provided few guides for either composition or listening.\"\n\nTonality may be considered generally, with no restrictions on the date or place the music was produced, and little restriction on the materials and methods used. This definition includes pre-17th century western music, as well as much non-western music. By the middle of the 20th century, it had become \"evident that triadic structure does not necessarily generate a tone center, that non-triadic harmonic formations may be made to function as referential elements, and that the assumption of a twelve-tone complex does not preclude the existence of tone centers\" . For the composer and theorist George Perle, tonality is not \"a matter of 'tone-centeredness', whether based on a 'natural' hierarchy of pitches derived from the overtone series or an 'artificial' pre compositional ordering of the pitch material; nor is it essentially connected to the kinds of pitch structures one finds in traditional diatonic music\" .\n\nOne area of disagreement going back to the origin of the term tonality is whether tonality is \"natural\" or inherent in acoustical phenomena, whether it is inherent in the human nervous system or a psychological construct, whether it is inborn or learned, and to what degree it is all these things . A viewpoint held by many theorists since the third quarter of the 19th century, following the publication in 1862 of the first edition of Helmholtz's \"On the Sensation of Tone\" , holds that diatonic scales and tonality arise from natural overtones (, , , , , ; ; ).\n\nRudolph Réti differentiates between harmonic tonality of the traditional kind found in homophony, and melodic tonality, as in monophony. In the harmonic kind, tonality is produced through the V-I chord progression, <d> <t>. He argues that in the progression I-x-V-I (and all progressions), V-I is the only step \"which \"as such\" produces the effect of tonality,\" and that all other chord successions, diatonic or not, being more or less similar to the tonic-dominant, are \"the composer's free invention.\" He describes melodic tonality (the term coined independently and 10 years earlier by Estonian composer Jaan Soonvald ) as being \"entirely different from the classical type,\" wherein, \"the whole line is to be understood as a musical unit mainly through its relationship to this basic note [the tonic],\" this note not always being the tonic as interpreted according to harmonic tonality. His examples are ancient Jewish and Gregorian chant and other Eastern music, and he points out how these melodies often may be interrupted at any point and returned to the tonic, yet harmonically tonal melodies, such as that from Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\" below, are actually \"strict harmonic-rhythmic pattern[s],\" and include many points \"from which it is impossible, that is, illogical, unless we want to destroy the innermost sense of the whole line\" to return to the tonic (, ).\n\nConsequently, he argues, melodically tonal melodies resist harmonization and only reemerge in western music after, \"harmonic tonality was abandoned,\" as in the music of Claude Debussy: \"melodic tonality plus modulation is [Debussy's] modern tonality\" .\n\nThe noun \"tonality\" and adjective \"tonal\" are widely applied also, in studies of early and modern Western music, and in non-Western traditional music (Arabic maqam, Indian raga, Indonesian slendro etc.), to the \"systematic arrangements of pitch phenomena and relations between them\" (; ). Felix Wörner, Ullrich Scheideler, and Philip Rupprecht in the introduction to a collection of essays dedicated to the concept and practice of tonality between 1900 and 1950 describe it generally as \"the awareness of key in music\" .\n\nHarold Powers, in a series of articles, used terms \"sixteenth-century tonalities\" (; ; ) and \"Renaissance tonality\" . He borrowed German \"Tonartentyp\" from , who related it to Palestrina, translated it into English as \"tonal type\" , and systematically applied the concept of \"tonal types\" to Renaissance sacred and paraliturgical polyphony. Cristle Collins Judd (the author of many articles and a thesis dedicated to the early pitch systems) found \"tonalities\" in this sense in motets of Josquin Desprez . Judd also wrote of \"chant-based tonality\" , meaning \"tonal\" polyphonic compositions based on plainchant. Peter Lefferts found \"tonal types\" in the French polyphonic chanson of the 14th century , Italian musicologists Marco Mangani and Daniele Sabaino in the late Renaissance music , and so on.\n\nThe wide usage of \"tonality\" and \"tonal\" has been supported by several other musicologists (of diverse provenance); it can be traced, e.g., in the articles collected in . A possible reason for this broader usage of terms \"tonality\" and \"tonal\" is the attempt to translate German \"Tonart\" as \"tonality\" and \"Tonarten-\" prefix as \"tonal\" (for example, it is rendered so in the seminal \"New Grove\" article \"Mode\", ; ; etc.). Therefore, two different German words \"Tonart\" and \"Tonalität\" have sometimes been translated as \"tonality\" although they are not the same words in German.\nIn 1882, Hugo Riemann defined the term \"Tonalität\" specifically to include chromatic as well as diatonic relationships to a tonic, in contrast to the usual diatonic concept of \"Tonart\". In the neo-Riemannian theory of the late 20th century, however, the same chromatic chord relations cited by Riemann came to be regarded as a fundamental example of nontonal triadic relations, reinterpreted as a product of the hexatonic cycle (the six-pitch-class set forming a scale of alternating minor thirds and semitones, Forte's set-type 6–20, but manifested as a succession of from four to six alternating major and minor triads), defined without reference to a tonic (; ).\n\nIn the 20th century, music that no longer conformed to the strict definition of common-practice tonality could nevertheless still involve musical phenomena (harmonies, cadential formulae, harmonic progressions, melodic gestures, formal categories) arranged or understood in relation to a referential tonic . For example, the closing bars of the first movement of Béla Bartók's \"Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta\" do not involve a composed-out triad, but rather a diverging-converging pair of chromatic lines moving from a unison A to an octave E and back to a unison A again, providing a framing \"deep structure\" based on a tritone relationship that nevertheless is not analogous to a tonic-dominant axis, but rather remains within the single functional domain of the tonic, A . To distinguish this species of tonality (found also, for example, in the music of Barber, Berg, Bernstein, Britten, Fine, Hindemith, Poulenc, Prokofiev, and, especially, Stravinsky) from the stricter kind associated with the 18th century, some writers use the term \"neotonality\" (; ), while others prefer to use the term \"centricity\" , and still others retain the term, \"tonality\" , in its broader sense, or use word combinations like \"extended tonality\" (; ).\n\nIn music information retrieval, techniques have been developed to determine the key of a piece of classical Western music (recorded in audio data format) automatically. These methods are often based on a compressed representation of the pitch content in a 12-dimensional pitch-class profile (chromagram) and a subsequent procedure that finds the best match between this representation and one of the prototype vectors of the 24 minor and major keys . For implementation, often the constant-Q transform is used, displaying the musical signal on a log frequency scale. Although a radical (over)simplification of the concept of tonality, such methods can predict the key of classical Western music well for most pieces. Other methods also take into consideration the sequentiality of music.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It can be an activity that can take place in \"any\" organisation during which people are assisted by others, who may be older, in a condition experienced to make explicit our ethics in order to assess the effectiveness of these values and associated behaviour for their own and others' long term well-being, and to reflect on and acquire other values and behaviour which they recognise as being more effective for long term well-being of self and others. There is a difference between literacy and education.\n\nThere has been very little reliable research on the results of values education classes, but there are some encouraging preliminary results.\n\nOne definition refers to it as the process that gives young people an initiation into values, giving knowledge of the rules needed to function in this mode of relating to other people, and to seek the development in the student a grasp of certain underlying principles, together with the ability to apply these rules intelligently, and to have the settled disposition to do so Some researchers use the concept values education as an umbrella of concepts that includes moral education and citizenship education Themes that values education can address to varying degrees are character, moral development, Religious Education, Spiritual development, citizenship education, personal development, social development and cultural development.\n\nThere is a further distinction between explicit values education and implicit values education where:\n\nAnother definition of value education is \"learning about self and wisdom of life\" in a self exploratory, systematic and scientific way through formal education.\n\nMorals as socio-legal-religious norms are supposed to help people behave responsibly. However, not all morals lead to responsible behaviour. Values education can show which morals are \"bad\" morals and which are \"good\". The change in behavior comes from confusing questions about right and wrong.\n\nAmerican psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg who specialized in research on moral education and reasoning, and\nwas best known for his theory of stages of moral development, believed children needed to be in an environment that allowed for open and public discussion of day-to-day conflicts and problems\nto develop their moral reasoning ability.\n\nCross has made a start at documenting some teacher training attempts.\n\nThis project of worldwide proportions inspired by the new religious movement called the Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University incorporates twelve values (unity, peace, happiness, hope, humility, simplicity, trust, freedom, co-operation, honesty, courage, love), and has formed the basis of thekiss whole-school ethos approach in schools such as West Kidlington Primary School, Kidlington whose head master Neil Hawkes and Values education coordinators Linda Heppenstall used the work and other programmes to help them form a values-based school. The LVEP website lists 54 countries where values education projects are undertaken.\n\nThe Human Values Foundation was established in 1995 to make available worldwide, a comprehensive values-themed programme for children from 4 to 12 years entitled \"Education in Human Values\". Its fully resourced lesson plans utilise familiar teaching techniques of discussion, story-telling, quotations, group singing, activities to reinforce learning and times of quiet reflection. Following the success of \"EHV\", a second programme was published – Social and Emotional Education (\"SEE\"), primarily for ages 12 to 14+ but it has also proved constructive for older children identified as likely to benefit from help getting their lives 'back on track'. The programmes enable children and young people to explore and put into practice a wide spectrum of values with the potential to enrich their lives. Through the experiential learning, over time participants develop a well considered personal morality, all the while gaining invaluable emotional and social skills to help them lead happy, fulfilled, successful lives.\n\nCharacter education is an umbrella term generally used to describe the teaching of children in a manner that will help them develop as personal and social beings. However, this definition requires research to explain what is meant by \"personal and social being\". Concepts that fall under this term include social and emotional learning, moral reasoning/cognitive development, life skills education, health education; violence prevention, critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and conflict resolution and mediation. Lickona (1996) mentions eleven principles of successful character education. It seems to have been applied in the UK and the United States\n\nScience of Living (Jeevan Vigyan; Jeevan = Life and Vigyan = Science) is a detailed program that complements the current educational approach with spiritual and value based learning. While both mental and physical development is needed for a student's growth, Jeevan Vigyan adds a third pillar – that of emotional intelligence and morality (or values) – to education in schools and colleges. A combination of theory and practice, Jeevan Vigyan draws on the findings of various life-sciences as well as nutritional sciences. Our parasympathetic nervous system and endocrinal system are known to be the drivers of our emotions and our behavior. These biological centers can be influenced Science of Living through a system of yogic exercises, breathing exercises, medication and contemplation. Science of Living's source of inspiration is Jain Acharya Ganadhipati Shri Tulsi (1914–1997). His thoughts were further developed and expanded by Acharya Shri Mahapragya (1920–2010). Currently Muni Shri Kishan Lal Ji, under the leadership of Acharya Shri Mahashraman, is the Principal of SOL.;\n\nTaylor gives a thorough overview of values education in 26 European countries.\n\nThe Australian Government currently funds Values education in its schools, with its own publications and funding of school forums on values education at all levels of education. It also helps in becoming a better person. A conference on \"Moral Education and Australian Values\" was held in 2007 at Monash University.\n\nThe Indian Government currently promote Values education in its schools. The Ministry of Human Resource Development has taken strong step to introduce values among schools and teachers training centers. Also India is known as \nthe land of introducing values. In India, under the leadership of B. Shaji Kumar, New Golden Education Trust (NGET), values Based Education has been progressing throughout the country among schools from playschool to twelve std class.\n\nA key feature of education in Indonesia is the five principles of Pancasila.\n\nElementary school and middle school students from first to ninth grades will be taught the importance of life, to listen to others with different opinions, to be fair, respect their country and learn about foreign cultures.\n\nFor Edukasyon sa Pagpapakatao (EsP) (the version of the Values Education in the Philippines), the signs or basic skills of functional literacy decides and acts toward common good with accountability.It means, EsP aims to cultivate and develop the ethical character of students. The EsP aims to guide the student to find the meaning of his life, his role in society to share in building the community\nthe operative truth, freedom, justice and love. To demonstrate this, she must possess five basic skills: understanding, reflection, consultation, decision and action.\n\nTeacher training institutions in Singapore all have curricular for learning to teach civics and moral education programmes – but students do not take these as seriously as they should due to lack of assessment. The reason has been said to be the lack of innovative teaching approaches such as the discourse pedagogy.\n\nThere is an obligatory school subject that includes the aspect of values education and Citizenship Culture and Ethics. It is taught in 7th or 8th grade of primary school. Besides this there are two elective subjects that partly deal with values education: Religions and Ethics (for 7th, 8th, and 9th grade) and Philosophy for children (Critical thinking, Ethical exploring, Me and the other; for 7th, 8th, and 9th grade). Slovenian educational system does not require special training in the field of values education for teachers that teach mentioned subjects .\n\nValues education is a part of Swedish schools. Whereas the formal curricula is about educating students to be competent democratic citizens by practising student participation, qualitative studies have shown that in everyday school life, values education and school democracy often appeared to be reduced to traditional disciplining with high focus on rules and regulations. This in turn evokes some critiques among students. Most research on values education in Sweden is done by qualitative methods, especially ethnographic or field studies as well as focus group and interview studies. Some studies have been conducted by survey and other quantitative methods. In addition, theoretical work with roots in Dewey and Habermas has been done on deliberative democracy and deliberative conversations in schools.\n\nIn Thailand, values have traditionally been taught within the context of Buddhist religious education. Since 1982 there has been a revival of applied values as an extracurricular activity suitable for Buddhist, Moslem and Christian students alike to prepare Thai students for the effects of globalization.\n\nSince 1988 the British government, although not recognising or calling it values education, has promoted and respected values in the guise of spiritual, moral, social and cultural development (SMSCD) leaving the initiative to individual schools to decide how values education standards should be met. It is not clear whether there are standards of values education. It should be noted that the Government and state school systems have never called it \"values education\". Values education courses in Britain may be implemented in the form of government supported campaigns such as Social & Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL, but are more often provided by local experts in the form of LVEP.\n\nOne head teacher in Cornwall has achieved national recognition for his work on character development and 'virtues', at Kehelland Village School , based on Baha'i teachings. He was asked to develop the primary section of the University of Birmingham's Character Education pack for use with the national curriculum .\n\n"}

He became first a symbol of the Portuguese working-class people, and eventually into the unofficial personification of Portugal.\n\"Zé\", in Portuguese, is a common short form of the name \"José\" - as \"Joe\" is for \"Joseph\", in English - and \"Povinho\" is a diminutive for \"Povo\", which means \"people\". His name is thus the equivalent of \"Joe Public\", \"Joe Everyman\", \"Joe Shmoe\", or \"John Doe\".\n\nThe first appearance of \"Zé Povinho\" was on 22 May 1875, in \"A Lanterna Mágica\" magazine, although that appearance did not attribute him with a name. He was named in the 6 December 1875 issue of the same magazine. Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro kept drawing this character throughout his lifetime (nearly another 30 years); the drawings were published in many of the more popular magazines and newspapers such as \"O António Maria\", \"A Paródia\", \"O Commércio do Porto Illustrado\" and \"Pontos nos iis\".\n\nPovinho is a well-regarded, kindly man who lives simply, and is regularly depicted as mocking the powerful. He is not a figure of authority but rather a simple man of the people, acting as a tool of criticism against the powerful, the political and elitist fringes of the society, injustice and tyranny.\n\n\"Zé Povinho\" became, and still is, a popular character in Portugal. Being drawn as a country laborer led to some aversion and denial from the Portuguese people to be represented as such. Yet his kindness, his will to help others and, most of all, his utter contempt and disrespect for the powerful ones that try to dominate him, made him popular. He ridicules the powerful, laughs at them, and then carries on with his simple life but has the same attitude towards the people's own weaknesses and prejudices.\n\n"}
