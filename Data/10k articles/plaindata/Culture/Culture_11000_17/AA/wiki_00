{"id": "46805317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46805317", "title": "Aleksandar Bošković", "text": "Aleksandar Bošković\n\nAleksandar Bošković is a social anthropologist from former Yugoslavia, who published fifteen books (authored and edited) and several hundred articles and book reviews on history and theory of anthropology, from a transactionalist and comparative perspective. In 2018/2019 he is Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies (Institut d'Études Avancées) in Lyon. He is also Professor in the Department of Ethnology and Anthropology (University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy), and Professor of Anthropology at the University of Donja Gorica in Montenegro. Since 2 February 2017, Bošković also heads the Department of Anthropological Research (within the Center for Sociological and Anthropological Studies) at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade, where he is Director of Research, and former (19 May 2009 – 1 February 2017) Head of the Center for Political Studies and Public Opinion Research. Aleksandar Bošković previously taught at the Universities of St Andrews (1994), Belgrade (then Yugoslavia, 1998), Brasília (Brazil, 1999–2001), University of the Witwatersrand (Johannesburg, South Africa, 2001–2003), and Rhodes University (Grahamstown, South Africa, 2003–2006). Between 2000 and 2014, Aleksandar Bošković was teaching in the Post-graduate Program in Anthropology of the Faculty of Social Sciences (FDV), University of Ljubljana (Slovenia). Since August 2016, he is the EASA Book Series Editor. Together with Han Vermeulen, he is co-convenor of the History of Anthropology Network of the EASA.\n\nBorn in Zemun, Yugoslavia, Bošković studied philosophy in Belgrade between 1982 and 1990. During his studies, he was mostly interested in the work of Ernst Cassirer (1874–1945), but at this time he also \"discovered\" Paul Feyerabend (1924–1994), who will be a lasting influence. Aleksandar spent some years in the so-called \"pro-democracy\" journalism in Yugoslavia (1983–1990), in the process working as foreign politics editor and member of the Editorial Board of the Belgrade weekly magazine \"Student\" (1984/1985) and writing for almost all of the major (mostly Belgrade-based) Yugoslav magazines between 1984 and 1990. Aleksandar's journalistic texts and interviews dealt with political issues (he interviewed some of the former Praxis School philosophers – including Gajo Petrović, Svetozar Stojanović, and Mihailo Marković), foreign affairs, but also with cultural issues, comics and science fiction.\n\nHis early scholarly publications were influenced by the interest in the study of myth and religion, especially through the perspectives offered by Joseph Campbell (1904–1987) and Mircea Eliade (1907–1986). As a conclusion of the several decades of interest in the study of myth, he edited the \"Dictionary of Deities and Mythic Beings of the World\" (in Serbo-Croatian; co-edited with Milan Vukomanović and Zoran Jovanović), a single-volume reference work with 14 contributors, covering \"Non-classical Mythology\". Bošković contributed over 150 entries himself, including all on Australia, Mesoamerica, Africa, Celts, and some on Middle East and Mesopotamia (Baal, Gilgamesh, Ziusudra), and India (Ganesha, Parvati, Rudra, Shiva).\n\nSome of his early texts focused on ancient Mesoamerican religions (especially Maya and Mexican/ Aztec). In 1990, Bošković went to Tulane University in New Orleans to study anthropology with Munro S. Edmonson [1924–2002]. Fieldwork in Guatemala in 1991 was inspired by the interest in Classic Maya ceramics, but this interest gradually waned, mostly due to Bošković's dissatisfaction with the then-dominant \"direct historical approach\" in Mesoamerican studies and the tendency by some anthropologists to use material from looted sites. However, he continued to occasionally review books on this topic, especially for the journal \"Anthropos\". He kept in touch with several prominent Maya archaeologists, like Richard E. W. Adams (1931–2015), American archaeologist who taught at the University of Texas at San Antonio, who influenced Bošković with his general perspective and methodological rigor; and also with the leading French Mayanist at the time, Claude-François Baudez (1932–2013), from the CNRS (Centre national de la recherche scientifique). The interest in Mesoamerica was revisited in a book published by Archaeopress in 2017, \"Mesoamerican Religions and Archaeology\". The book includes a number of review essays, including chapters on The Meaning of Maya Myths, Aztec Great Goddesses, and ways of interpreting the Codex Borbonicus (or Codex Cihuacoatl).\n\nBošković defended the M.A. thesis (supervised by Munro S. Edmonson), \"William Robertson Smith and the Anthropological Study of Myth,\" at Tulane University in April 1993. From New Orleans he went to do Ph.D. at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. This move was motivated by the interest in contemporary anthropology, combined with the interpretive approach, to which he came through the influence of Clifford Geertz (1926–2006). In St. Andrews, he was first supervised by Ladislav Holy (1933–1997). Holy proved to be a major influence on Bošković's research with his version of methodological individualism. Following Holy's illness, Bošković was supervised by Nigel J. Rapport, and defended his Ph.D. thesis (\"Constructing Gender in Contemporary Anthropology\") on 1 November 1996. The ethnographic part of the thesis focused on the feminist groups in Slovenia. Methodologically, some of the conclusions were influenced by Ladislav Holy's critical interpretative approach, as well as by Marilyn Strathern's and Henrietta L. Moore's anthropology of gender – especially considering gender as a social and cultural construct).\n\nWhile in St Andrews, Bošković met a brilliant linguist in the Department of Social Anthropology, Sándor Hervey (1942–1997) and read critical editions of Ferdinand de Saussure's (1857–1913) \"Cours de linguistique générale\". Saussure's concept of the linguistic sign also proved to be a major influence in his work.\n\nBošković taught his first academic course at the University of St Andrews in the Martinmas Term of 1994 (\"Mesoamerican Pre-Columbian Civilisations\", at the Honours’ level), and began teaching part-time at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Ljubljana in 2000 (courses \"Contemporary Anthropology\" and \"Anthropology and Feminism\", at the M.A. level). However, his most important teaching experience was when he moved to the Department of Anthropology of the University of Brasília, where he was influenced by Mariza Peirano's and Roberto Cardoso de Oliveira's (1928–2006) concept of a horizontally-structured anthropology. (This will later influence his interest in \"World Anthropologies.\") In Brasília, Bošković taught courses on gender, myth, anthropological theory, Latin America, but also started to develop some interest in the concept of Europe, as he was actually hired as \"Visiting Professor of European Ethnology.\" His monograph on Mesoamerica (\"Mesoamerican Religions and Archaeology: Essays in Pre-Columbian Civilizations\") was published by Archaeopress in January 2017.\n\nFollowing the invitation of Robert J. Thornton, in February 2001 Bošković moved to the University of the Witwatersrand (Johannesburg, South Africa) on the Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship. There he also taught courses on religion, myth, and ethnicity. While in Johannesburg, he was fortunate enough to meet (and have opportunity to discuss anthropology with) W.D. Hammond-Tooke (1926–2004), the last of the great 20th century South African anthropologists. In 2003, Bošković was hired as Senior lecturer at the Department of Anthropology of Rhodes University, a department that Hammond-Tooke helped establish during the 1960s. At Rhodes, Bošković further developed his interests in the history and theory of anthropology. This Department provided a brilliant academic setting, with colleagues like Chris de Wet, Robin Palmer, Penny Bernard, among others. Furthermore, his interest in history and theory of anthropology resulted in publication of several books. His book \"Myth, Politics, Ideology\" was published in late 2006 in Belgrade, and it covered different theoretical aspects of the study of myths, understood (in Raymond Aron's sense) as part of ideology. The book also included several chapters on different aspects of Mesoamerican religions – some in revised versions from their original publications, and some previously unpublished. This also coincided with Bošković's interest in the study of ethnicity and nationalism, and his overall view that multiculturalism is an essential component of all human societies. Some of these aspects were discussed while he was a guest at the University of Oslo in 2007, following the invitation of a friend and colleague, Thomas Hylland Eriksen.\n\nAleksandar Bošković was invited to teach in the Department of Ethnology and Anthropology of the Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy in 2009. He began teaching courses related to history and theory in anthropology, mostly due to the favorable reception of his introductory book in anthropology, published in 2010. In 2012, the Senate of the University of Belgrade elected him as a full Professor, so he teaches full-time in the Department from 1 January 2013.\n\nIn 2006, Aleksandar Bošković briefly worked as Program Director (in charge of transitional justice) in the Humanitarian Law Center in Belgrade. The interest in human rights followed on his criticism of nationalism and violence and led to his continuing collaboration with other human rights organizations in Serbia in the 1990s (like the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights). Bošković also worked for the UNDP in Belgrade on several short-term contracts, again on topics related to transitional justice. Throughout this period he has been an outspoken critic of nationalism, as well as of all other totalitarian and discriminatory practices and tendencies within Serbian society. In mid-1990s Bošković used the then-emerging concept of Virtual Reality to refer to the ways in which the political elites of Serbia (as well as other post-Yugoslav societies) understood the reality and the world among them. Several of his article on this topic were published in the \"Canadian Journal for Political Theory\" and widely read. The suggestion made in his writings was that the foreign observers and diplomats trying to communicate with Serbian leaders would be much more successful if they were aware of the concept of virtual reality, as the reality that the local political leaders believed in had no connection with what is ordinary considered as \"real\".\n\nFollowing his emerging interest in psychoanalysis, Bošković used Christopher Bollas' concept of the \"fascist state of mind\" to elaborate on the political and social situation in Serbia, in an essay published in the Belgrade weekly \"Novi magazin\", on 15 June 2017.\n\nWhen considering wider implications of the persuasiveness of nationalist-inspired thinking and ideas, he organized a round table debate dedicated to Benedict Anderson (1936–2015), at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade. This was at least in part due to the influence that Bruce Kapferer's ideas had on him. Bošković also published a paper on anthropological studies of myths and nationalism in 2013, in the oldest anthropology journal in the world, \"Zeitschrift für Ethnologie\" - as a review article of Kapferer's major book. Among the more recent published contributions, there is also a chapter that deals with Serbia's troubled relationship with her own past, and the inability of the country's elites to come to terms with its nationalistic past. This paper is based on a presentation from the conference held at Landskronna (Sweden), in early June 2012. The chapter's title is \"Serbia and the Surplus of History: Being Small, Large, and Small Again\".\n\nIn connection with the political attitude that presupposes rejection of all forms of discrimination and intolerance, and following up on his research on gender for his PhD thesis, Bošković also contributed an entry \"Images of Gender and Sexuality in Southern Africa\" for \"The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies\", as well as (with his colleague from the Institute of Social Sciences, Suzana Ignjatović) on \"Gender equality in Serbia\".\n\nSince August 2008, Aleksandar is Director of Research or Research Professor (French \"Directeur d'études\"; in Serbo-Croatian \"Naučni savetnik\") and between May 2009 and February 2017 he was Head of the Center for Political Research and Public Opinion in the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade (Serbia). He has been employed full time in this Institute since 1 July 2003. In October 2009, Bošković started teaching in the Department of Ethnology and Anthropology of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy, and was formally awarded full Professorship by the Senate of the University of Belgrade in November 2012. He was formally hired (tenure, full time) by the Faculty of Philosophy from 1 January 2013. He teaches Ethnological and Anthropological Theories and Comparative Religion (second-year course) on the undergraduate level, Methodology on Master's level, and History of Anthropology at the Doctoral level. In 2017, Bošković started teaching Anthropology at the newly established Faculty of Applied Science of the University of Donja Gorica (UDG) in Montenegro.\n\nBošković edited a volume \"Other People's Anthropologies: Ethnographic Practice on the Margins\" (New York and Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2008; paperback edition in 2010), a book that received good reviews, and is being used as a reference work on the topic. The book presented an important contribution to the growing field of \"World Anthropologies,\" as it dealt with different national/regional anthropological traditions (including Russian, Dutch, Bulgarian, Kenyan, Argentinian, Turkish, Cameroonian, Japanese, Yugoslav, Norwegian, and Brazilian), all of them located outside of the so-called \"central (or dominant) anthropological traditions\" (Anglo-American, French and German). However, better known in Serbo-Croatian (and in the former Yugoslav region) is his book \"Kratak uvod u antropologiju\" [A Brief Introduction to Anthropology], published in late 2010 by the Jesenski i Turk in Zagreb (Croatia). Serbian edition of the book was published in April 2010, based on a series of lectures delivered at the Rex Cultural Centre. In 2014, he published a book in Serbia on Anthropological perspectives\n\nAs a result of his long-standing collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology,\nAleksandar Bošković also co-edited a volume on the development of anthropologies/ ethnologies in Southeastern Europe between 1945 and 1991, with Chris Hann, in which he also contributed a Postscript. He also published a review essay on the uses of rational choice in anthropology in \"Ethnos\" in 2012 (with Suzana Ignjatović). The interest in rationality also resulted in the process of helping Suzana Ignjatović organize a Symposium about Individualism at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade, on 20 October 2017. The Symposium resulted in the edited volume, with international contributors including Walter Block, Veselin Vukotić, and Patrick Laviolette. This event also received attention (and formed a major part in the leading story) in one of the leading Serbian news magazines.\n\nSince 1986, Aleksandar gave more than 220 guest lectures or seminars and six short courses in 27 countries. He delivered these lectures and seminars at, among other places, University of Oslo, University of Bergen, Goldsmiths College, Vanderbilt University, College of William and Mary, University of Cambridge, University of St. Andrews, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Hebrew University of Jerusalem's School of Philosophy and Religions, and University of Hamburg. In recent years, he also spoke about topics such as rationality (both at the IUAES Congress in Manchester in 2013, and at the Inter-Congress in Chiba, Japan in 2014), identity (at the meeting of the Croatian Ethnological Society in Zagreb in 2013), Giambattista Vico (at the ASA Decennial Conference in Edinburgh, 2014), ethnicity (in the Masters’ seminar at the University of Leipzig, 2014) and anthropology in Belgrade (at the Institute of Social Anthropology, Wilhelms University of Münster (Germany), in 2014). In late April 2017, Bošković lectured at the Department of Social Anthropology at the Panteion University in Athens, as part of the ERASMUS exchange.\n\nHe co-organized (with Salma Siddique) a panel on \"Anthropology and psychotherapy\" at the ASA conference in Exeter in April 2015, and presented a seminar on Edvard Munch at the Comparative Sociology Department of the University of Leiden. With Professor Günther Schlee, he organized a Workshop commemorating 75th anniversary of the \"African Political Systems\" at the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, 10–11 September 2015. With David Shankland, he co-convened the workshop \"Themes in the history of anthropology\" at the 2016 EASA, and with Thomas Hylland Eriksen, the workshop \"Clashing scales of infrastructural development\" at the 2017 SIEF Congress in Göttingen.\n\nIn early 2018, following the invitation of Salma Siddique, he spent six weeks as a Visiting Researcher at the University of Aberdeen. During this period, Bošković gave two talks about The Meaning of Maya Myths (unrelated to the 1989 article), at King's College, Aberdeen and at the University of Edinburgh, as well as a lecture on Anthropology and Psychoanalysis, in the School of Education. In the early June, he gave a talk on Classic Maya myths and politics at the 12th Annual International Conference on Comparative Mythology at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "40896593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40896593", "title": "AllTrials", "text": "AllTrials\n\nAllTrials (sometimes called All Trials or AllTrials.net) is a project advocating that clinical research adopt the principles of open research. The project summarizes itself as \"All trials registered, all results reported\": that is, all clinical trials should be listed in a clinical trials registry, and their results should always be shared as open data.\n\nAt the center of the organisation is a petition signed by over 85,000 individuals and\n599 organisations (as of August 2015):\n\nBen Goldacre, author of \"Bad Science\" and \"Bad Pharma\", is a founder of the campaign and its most public spokesperson. In 2016 he participated in the launch of the OpenTrials database.\n\nAllTrials is an international initiative of Bad Science, \"BMJ\", Centre for Evidence-based Medicine, Cochrane Collaboration, James Lind Initiative, \"PLOS\" and Sense About Science and is being led in the US by Sense About Science USA, Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine and the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice.\n\nThe project is a reaction to under-reporting of research.\n\nA substantial proportion (estimates range from one-third to one-half) of medical research goes unpublished. It has also been shown that negative findings are less likely to be published than positive ones, even in the absence of conflicts of interest.\n\nMuch medical research is done by the pharmaceutical industry, which have a conflict of interest reporting results which may hurt sales of their products. There is a measurable funding bias in reporting; studies have shown that published drug studies funded by pharmaceutical companies are much more likely to support the use of the tested drug than studies with other funding. Industry-funded trials are also less likely to be published.\n\nIf the statistical methods used to analyse the trial are not chosen before the study it started, there is a danger that researchers will intentionally or unintentionally pick the method that gives the results they expect, or which gives the most significant results. This makes the analysis statistically invalid.\n\nNot publishing trials which fail to find a clear effect exposes trial volunteers to pointless risk and wastes research effort (as the same trial is repeated over and over). It also biases the medical literature, making it report effects where none exist (since, given enough trials, eventually one will find a difference by pure chance).\n\nPre-trial registration makes non-publication and changes in analysis methods obvious to medical reviewers. It also enables authors of meta-studies to track down and analyse missing data. Finally, it lets doctors and patients know when a trial is looking for volunteers.\n\nThere are other sources of bias, such as the conditions sometimes attached to funding by funding agencies with a financial interest in the trial's outcome. Medical researchers may be asked to agree to allow the funding agency to censor results. Some funding agencies may also refuse to give the medical researcher access to the raw data, giving them only the finished analysis, or even a draft paper, and asking them to put their name to it. This is not acceptable academic practice, and some academic journals require that authors sign a statement that they have not entered into such agreements.\n\nBen Goldacre, a physician and spokesperson for the campaign, would like to address the systematic flaws in clinical research which cause data to be lost after it is gathered.\n\nThe campaign has been widely covered, and supported, in the academic press. The British Medical Journal and PLOS are founding members. \"Nature\" and The Lancet both published supportive articles in January 2014.\n\nThere has also been mainstream media coverage.\n\nThere has been criticism from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), with senior vice-president Matt Bennett saying that trial data disclosure measures which AllTrials has recommended to the European Medicines Agency \"could risk patient privacy, lead to fewer clinical trials, and result in fewer new medicines to meet patient needs and improve health.\".\n\nAllTrials have published a detailed statement of exactly what they want to see published, which states \"The AllTrials campaign is not calling for individual patient data to be made publicly available\".\n\nA 2012 editorial published by senior regulators from the European Medicines agency largely agreed with AllTrials, saying \"We consider it neither desirable nor realistic to maintain the status quo of limited availability of regulatory trials data\". They were also of the opinion that adequate standards for protection of personal data could be written. However, they warned that third party reanalysis was neither a guarantee of quality nor of lack of conflict of interest, which, in the worst case, could lead to negative public health consequences.\n\nThey suggested that reanalyses should therefore be subject to the same regulations as sponsor analyses, such as registering analysis plans. They argued against completely unrestricted access to data, but in favour of broader access. AllTrials is not calling for completely unrestricted access to raw data, so the scope of disagreements is limited to what restrictions should be in place.\n\nThe campaign is an initiative of Sense About Science, Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, James Lind Alliance, Cochrane Collaboration, BMJ Group, PLOS, and Bad Science. The petition statement of AllTrials has been signed by organizations including Wellcome Trust, British Library, Medical Research Council (UK), British Heart Foundation, Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, BioMed Central, National Physicians Alliance, Royal Society of Medicine, Health Research Authority, American Medical Student Association, GlaxoSmithKline, and others.\n\nAs of May 2017, The AllTrials petition has been signed by 90,282 people and 721 organisations. In October 2016, AllTrials published a road map detailing steps that various types of organisations can take to get more trials registered and more results reported.\n\n85 investors with >€3.5 trillion (£2.45trn; $3.83trn) of investments have supported AllTrials (as of July 2015), with Peter van der Werf of RobecoSAM saying: \"We deem this to be a financially material factor and encourage all companies to gain credibility regarding their approach to clinical trial transparency by signing up to the AllTrials principles.\". The Laura and John Arnold Foundation provided early and ongoing financial support.\n\nThe European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America have expressed interest in lobbying against the campaign. Campaign supporters criticized Hoffmann-La Roche's plans to be more open but not to the extent requested by AllTrials.\n\n\n"}

Historians disagree over the time period during which the expansion took place, but estimate it occurred roughly between 1550 and 1850.\n\nAmerindian peoples of the pampas, such as the Puelche, Pehuenche, and Tehuelche, adopted the Mapudungun language as their main language (both of their names are in Mapudungun). Together with Quechua, Aymara, Guarani, and Nahuatl, Mapudungun was among the few Amerindian languages that expanded in use on the continents after the beginning of European colonization. This area of the Patagonia was generally isolated from European settlement until late in the 19th century.\n\nThe Mapuche who migrated to Patagonia lived often as nomads. As European settlers established frontier settlements, the Mapuche raided them for cattle or looted their produce. They drove off the cattle stolen in the incursions (\"malones\") and took them to Chile through the mountain passes to trade for goods, especially alcoholic beverages. The main trail for this trade was called Camino de los chilenos and ran a length of about from Buenos Aires Province to the mountain passes of Neuquén Province.\n\nThe \"lonco\" Calfucurá crossed the Andes from Chile to the Pampas around 1830 to aid the indigenous people, after Juan Manuel de Rosas, the governor of Buenos Aires, started to fight the Boreanos tribe. However, other sources directly contradict this statement, saying that de Rosas contacted the leader in Chile for help fighting against the Boreanos tribe. In 1859 Calfucurá attacked Bahía Blanca in Argentina with 3,000 warriors. Many other bands of Mapuche also became involved in the internal conflicts of Argentina until the Conquest of the Desert. To counter the cattle raids (and the native peoples on horseback), in the 1870s Argentina constructed a deep trench, called Zanja de Alsina, to prevent cattle from being driven west and establish a boundary to the raiding tribes in the pampas.\n\nArgentine authorities were worried that strong connections between the Araucanized tribes and Chile would give Chile influence over the pampas. Both Argentina and Chile claimed the Patagonia. The Argentine government feared that in case of war, the natives would side with the Chileans, who would be able to carry the war all the way to the vicinity of Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 1872 Cufulcurá and his 6,000 followers went across the pampas to attack the cities of General Alvear, Veinticinco de Mayo and Nueve de Julio, resulting in the deaths of 300 settlers and the loss of 200,000 head of cattle, which the Mapuche drove back to Chile. After this, Argentina organized its forces to launch what it called the Conquest of the Desert and attacked indigenous people for years. It is estimated that more than 5000 native peoples were killed or captured in that major assault, which was facilitated by the new Remington weapon arming the 6,000 Argentine soldiers (as stated by Gen. Ignacio Fotheringham) [Bodley p. 63, 72]. However, the losses to the Army were minimal, with only 13 soldiers killed; the lop-sided 'victory' was taken as proof of European superiority and celebrated in art. The 100 peso bill of Argentina has a picture honoring the Conquest of the Desert on one side.\n\n"}
{"id": "1381344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1381344", "title": "Ars Poetica (Horace)", "text": "Ars Poetica (Horace)\n\nArs Poetica, or \"The Art of Poetry\", is a poem written by Horace c. 19 BC, in which he advises poets on the art of writing poetry and drama. The \"Ars Poetica\" has \"exercised a great influence in later ages on European literature, notably on French drama\" and has inspired poets and authors since it was written. Although it had been familiar since the Middle Ages, it is used in literary criticism since the Renaissance.\n\nThe poem was written in hexameter verse as an Epistle (or Letter) to Lucius Calpurnius Piso (the Roman senator and consul) and his two sons, and is sometimes referred to as the \"Epistula Ad Pisones\", or \"Epistle to the Pisos\". The first mention of its name as the \"Ars Poetica\" was c. 95 by the classical literary critic Quintilian in his \"Institutio Oratoria\", and since then it has been known by that name. The translations of the original epistle are typically in the form of prose.\n\n\"Written, like Horace's other epistles of this period, in a loose conversational frame, \"Ars poetica\" consists of 476 lines containing nearly 30 maxims for young poets.\" But \"Ars Poetica\" is not a systematic treatise of theory, and it wasn't intended to be. It is an inviting and lively poetic letter, composed for friends who appreciate poetic literature.\n\nHorace approaches poetry from a practical standpoint—as a craft, or \"ars\"—rather than the theoretical approach of his predecessors, Aristotle and the philosopher Plato. He also holds the poet in high regard, as opposed, for instance, to Plato, who distrusts \"mimesis\" and who has philosopher Socrates say in Book 10 of the \"Republic\" that he would banish poets from the ideal state.\n\nThe following is a brief outline of the main subjects of the work:\n\n\"Many of...[the] apt phrases [of the Ars Poetica]...have passed into common literary parlance.\" Four quotations in particular are associated with the work:\n\n\nThe work is also known for its discussion of the principle of decorum (the use of appropriate vocabulary and diction in each style of writing) (l.81–106), and for Horace's criticisms of purple prose \"(purpureus pannus,\" l.15–16), a term coined by him to mean the use of flowery language. This principle is considered a core component of Horatian poetics as it principally aimed to achieve verisimilitude in artistic representation, guiding everything from the choice of genre to diction, dramatic characterization, meter, poetic invention, and the intended effect. Some cited that decorum enforces subordination such as of parts to whole, woman to man, desire to reason, and individual to state.\n\nIn line 191, Horace warns against \"deus ex machina\", the practice of resolving a convoluted plot by having an Olympian god appear and set things right. Horace writes \"Nec deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus\": \"That a god not intervene, unless a knot show up that be worthy of such an untangler\".\n\nPerhaps it can even be said that the quotability of Horace's \"Ars Poetica\" is what has given it a distinguished place in literary criticism: \"The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism\" says: \n\nThe Horatian platitude is usually given as \"instruct \"and\" delight\", but sometimes as \"instruct \"or\" delight\". The first reading implies that all literature must be instructive. A related ambiguity is that \"instruct\" might be better translated as \"help\", \"advise\", or \"warn\".

The purpose of wearing the dress can be to serve as self-identification with age mates, relatives or friends during social occasions or funerals. Affordability of fabrics such as Ankara has contributed to the popularity of uniform dressing for social occasions in Nigeria.\n\nThe word aso in Yoruba means cloth and ebi denotes family, so Aso ebi can be described as a family cloth usually worn during funerals or family ceremonies. However, the practice is now beyond family dressing because strangers of a celebrant can wear the Aso ebi.\n\nAyodele Olukoju, a Nigerian economic historian believes Aso ebi became a novelty in 1920 during a period of post World War I economic boom triggered by the higher prices for produce products such as Oil palm. However, William Bascom traced the origin to an earlier period when members of Yoruba age grades wear uniform dressing to mark fraternal bonds. In the 1950s, members of women organizations or egbes turn out to ceremonies and anniversaries of relatives in the same style of dress, sandals, lappa, smock, necklace, the culture signifies close friendship. The uniform dressing can also be a measure of personal affluence, because Aso ebi involves rivalry between various egbes or groups with each group competing to outshine each other in terms of quality, originality and richness of the uniform\n\nFrom the mid 1960s to the late 1970s, imported lace and george were incorporated into Nigerian fabrics and they became popular items used for Aso ebi. Increased demand for handcrafted traditional dresses such as Agbada led to a resurgence of tailors and fashion designers specialized in making native attires. The tailors strived to meet the increasing demand and designs of uniform dressing, sometimes with the aid of the fashion pages of magazines to make style choices. The rise of Aso ebi also coincided with an intense market of fashion and lifestyles magazines in Lagos whereby tailors look at designs for inspiration and their patrons buy the magazines to see whether they or their friends are pictured in it.\n\nAso ebi in recent times has become a city phenomenon that has diffused to other West African cultures. Dealers of imported and local textile materials have also benefited from the boom in demand for uniform dressing. Some textile dealers offer consultation services and bulk rates for the choice and cost of the dress and fabrics. While the price of fabrics in sewing the traditional attire is affordable, the aso ebi practice is still sometimes used as an identification with affluence, some wear expensive embroidery and extra layers of cloth, whereas others, who could not afford a whole outfit, added only matching tops and head coverings.\n\nowanbecommunity.org/brands/ceomania-alaso-oke/\n"}

She is an amalgam of all the goddesses of Indian culture and more significantly of goddess Durga. She is usually depicted as a woman clad in a saffron sari holding the Indian national flag, and sometimes accompanied by a lion.\n\nThe image of Bhāratmātā formed with the Indian independence movement of the late 19th century. A play by Kiran Chandra Bannerjee, \"Bhārat Mātā\", was first performed in 1873. The play set in 1770 Bengal famine depicted a woman and her husband who went to forest and encounters rebels. The priest takes them to temple where they were shown Bharat Mata. Thus they are inspired and led rebellion which result in defeat of the British. The \"Manushi\" magazine story traces origin to a satirical work \"Unabimsa Purana\" or \"The Nineteenth Purana\" by Bhudeb Mukhopadhyay which was first published anonymously in 1866. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay in 1882 wrote a novel \"Anandamath\" and introduced the hymn \"Vande Mātaram\", which soon became the song of the emerging freedom movement in India. As the British Raj created cartographic shape of India through the Geological Survey of India, the Indian nationalist developed it into an icon of nationalism. In 1920s, it became more political image sometimes including images of Mahatma Gandhi and Bhagat Singh. The Tiranga flag was also started being included during this period. In 1930s, the image entered in religious practice. The Bharat Mata temple was built in Benaras in 1936 by Shiv Prashad Gupt and was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi. This temple does not have any statuary but only a marble relief of the map of India.\n\nBipin Chandra Pal elaborated its meaning in idealizing and idealist terms, along with Hindu philosophical traditions and devotional practices. It represented an archaic spiritual essence, a transcendental idea of Universe as well as expressing Universal Hinduism and nationhood.\n\nAbanindranath Tagore portrayed Bhārat Mātā as a four-armed Hindu goddess wearing saffron-colored robes, holding the manuscripts, sheaves of rice, a mala, and a white cloth. The image of Bharatmata was an icon to create nationalist feeling in Indians during the freedom struggle. Sister Nivedita, an admirer of the painting, opined that the picture was refined and imaginative, with Bharatmata standing on green earth and blue sky behind her; feet with four lotuses, four arms meaning divine power; white halo and sincere eyes; and gifts Shiksha-Diksha-Anna-Bastra of the motherland to her children.\n\nIndian Independence activist Subramania Bharati saw Bharat Mata as the land of Ganga. He identified Bharat Mata as Parashakti. He also says that he has got the Darśana of Bharat Mata during his visit with his guru Sister Nivedita.\n\nIn the book \"Everyday Nationalism: Women of the Hindu Right in India\", Kalyani Devaki Menon argues that \"the vision of India as Bharat Mata has profound implications for the politics of Hindu nationalism\" and that the depiction of India as a Hindu goddess implies that it is not just the patriotic but also the religious duty of all Hindus to participate in the nationalist struggle to defend the nation. This association with Hinduism has caused controversy with India's religious minorities, especially its Muslim population.\n\nThe motto \"Bharat Mata ki Jai’\" (\"Victory for Mother India\") is used by the Indian Army.\n\nThe temple is located in the Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth campus in Varanasi. The temple houses a marble idol of Bharat Mata along with a marble relief map of India.\n\nThe Temple, a gift from the nationalists Shiv Prasad Gupta and Durga Prasad Khatri, was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi in 1936. Mahatma Gandhi said, \"I hope this temple, which will serve as a cosmopolitan platform for people of all religions, castes, and creeds including Harijans, will go a great way in promoting religious unity, peace, and love in the country.\"\n\nThe temple was founded by Swami Satyamitranand Giri on the banks of the Ganges in Haridwar. It has 8 storeys and is 180 feet tall. It was inaugurated by Indira Gandhi in 1983. Floors are dedicated to mythological legends, religious deities, freedom fighters and leaders.\n\nThe temple is located in Michael Nagar on Jessore Road, barely 2 km away from the Kolkata Airport. Here, Bharat Mata (the Mother Land) is portrayed through the image of 'Jagattarini Durga'. This was inaugurated on October 19, 2015 (Mahashashti Day of Durga Puja that year) by Shri Keshari Nath Tripathi, the Governor of West Bengal. The initiative to build the temple, which has been named 'Jatiya Shaktipeeth', was taken by the Spiritual Society of India in order to mark the 140th Anniversary of 'Vande Mataram', the hymn to the Mother Land.\n\n"}

{"id": "45960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45960", "title": "Cloaking device", "text": "Cloaking device\n\nA cloaking device is a hypothetical or fictional stealth technology that can cause objects, such as spaceships or individuals, to be partially or wholly invisible to parts of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. However, over the entire spectrum, a cloaked object scatters more than an uncloaked object.\n\nFictional cloaking devices have been used as plot devices in various media for many years.\n\nDevelopments in scientific research show that real-world cloaking devices can obscure objects from at least one wavelength of EM emissions. Scientists already use artificial materials called metamaterials to bend light around an object.\n\n\"\" screenwriter Paul Schneider, inspired in part by the 1958 film \"Run Silent, Run Deep,\" and in part by \"The Enemy Below,\" which in turn had been released the previous year, 1957, imagined cloaking as a space-travel analog of a submarine submerging, and employed it in the 1966 \"Star Trek\" episode \"Balance of Terror\", in which he introduced the Romulan species. (He likewise predicted, in the same episode, that invisibility, \"selective bending of light\" as described above, would have an enormous power requirement.) Another \"Star Trek\" screenwriter, D.C. Fontana, coined the term \"cloaking device\" for the 1968 episode \"The \"Enterprise\" Incident\", which also featured Romulans.\n\nWriters and game designers have since incorporated cloaking devices into many other science-fiction narratives, including \"Doctor Who\", \"Star Wars\", and \"Stargate\".\n\nAn operational, non-fictional cloaking device might be an extension of the basic technologies used by stealth aircraft, such as radar-absorbing dark paint, optical camouflage, cooling the outer surface to minimize electromagnetic emissions (usually infrared), or other techniques to minimize other EM emissions, and to minimize particle emissions from the object. The use of certain devices to jam and confuse remote sensing devices would greatly aid in this process, but is more properly referred to as \"active camouflage\". Alternatively, metamaterials provide the theoretical possibility of making electromagnetic radiation pass freely around the 'cloaked' object.\n\nOptical metamaterials have featured in several recent proposals for invisibility schemes. \"Metamaterials\" refers to materials that owe their refractive properties to the way they are structured, rather than the substances that compose them. Using transformation optics it is possible to design the optical parameters of a \"cloak\" so that it guides light around some region, rendering it invisible over a certain band of wavelengths.\n\nThese spatially varying optical parameters do not correspond to any natural material, but may be implemented using metamaterials. There are several theories of cloaking, giving rise to different types of invisibility.\nIn 2014, scientists demonstrated good cloaking performance in murky water, demonstrating that an object shrouded in fog can disappear completely when appropriately coated with metamaterial. This is due to the random scattering of light, such as that which occurs in clouds, fog, milk, frosted glass, etc., combined with the properties of the metamaterial coating. When light is diffused, a thin coat of metamaterial around an object can make it essentially invisible under a range of lighting conditions.\n\n\"Active camouflage\" (or \"adaptive camouflage\") is a group of camouflage technologies which would allow an object (usually military in nature) to blend into its surroundings by use of panels or coatings capable of changing color or luminosity. Active camouflage can be seen as having the potential to become the perfection of the art of camouflaging things from visual detection.\n\n\"Optical camouflage\" is a kind of active camouflage in which one wears a fabric which has an image of the scene directly behind the wearer projected onto it, so that the wearer appears invisible. The drawback to this system is that, when the cloaked wearer moves, a visible distortion is often generated as the 'fabric' catches up with the object's motion. The concept exists for now only in theory and in proof-of-concept prototypes, although many experts consider it technically feasible.\n\nIt has been reported that the British Army has tested an invisible tank. Mercedes demonstrated an invisible car using LED and camera in 2012.\n\nPlasma at certain density ranges absorbs certain bandwidths of broadband waves, potentially rendering an object invisible. However, generating plasma in air is too expensive and a feasible alternative is generating plasma between thin membranes instead. The Defense Technical Information Center is also following up research on plasma reducing RCS technologies. A plasma cloaking device was patented in 1991.\n\nA prototype Metascreen is a claimed cloaking device, which is just few micrometers thick and to a limited extent can hide 3D objects from microwaves in their natural environment, in their natural positions, in all directions, and from all of the observer's positions. It was prepared at the University of Texas, Austin by Professor Andrea Alù.\n\nThe metascreen consisted of a 66 micrometre thick polycarbonate film supporting an arrangement of 20 micrometer thick copper strips that resembled a fishing net. In the experiment, when the metascreen was hit by 3.6 GHz microwaves, it re-radiated microwaves of the same frequency that were out of phase, thus cancelling out reflections from the object being hidden. The device only cancelled out the scattering of microwaves in the first order. The same researchers published a paper on \"plasmonic cloaking\" the previous year.\n\nUniversity of Rochester physics professor John Howell and graduate student Joseph Choi have announced a scalable cloaking device which uses common optical lenses to achieve visible light cloaking on the macroscopic scale, known as the \"Rochester Cloak\". The device consists of a series of four lenses which direct light rays around objects which would otherwise occlude the optical pathway.\n\nThe concepts of cloaking are not limited to optics but can also be transferred to other fields of physics. For example, it was possible to cloak acoustics for certain frequencies as well as touching in mechanics. This renders an object \"invisible\" to sound or even hides it from touching.\n\n\n\n"}

In contrast, a work such as Richard Wolin's 1995 \"The Terms of Cultural Criticism: The Frankfurt School, Existentialism, Poststructuralism\" (1995) uses it as a broad-brush description.\n\nCultural critics came to the scene in the nineteenth century. Matthew Arnold and Thomas Carlyle are leading examples of a cultural critic of the Victorian age; in Arnold there is also a concern for religion. John Ruskin was another. Because of an equation made between ugliness of material surroundings and an impoverished life, aesthetes and others might be considered implicitly to be engaging in cultural criticism, but the actual articulation is what makes a critic. In France, Charles Baudelaire was a cultural critic, as was Søren Kierkegaard in Denmark and Friedrich Nietzsche in Germany.\n\nIn the twentieth century Irving Babbitt on the right, and Walter Benjamin on the left, might be considered major cultural critics. The field of play has changed considerably, in that the humanities have broadened to include cultural studies of all kinds, which are grounded in critical theory.\n\n\n"}

It is about four fictional girls, later five, who are mortal goddesses and fight an ancient evil called The Atrox. They each have different powers, destinies, and dark sides. They all wear moon amulets. When they turn 17, they have to make a choice. They can either become something more or continue their lives – but as mortals who have forgotten their lives and consequently, their powers, as Daughters of the Moon. All of the Daughters live in Los Angeles, battling the Atrox and its dark Followers. Sons of the Dark is a companion series. \n\n\"Vanessa, Catty, Serena, and Jimena seem like ordinary girls living in Los Angeles. But they each have a secret. Vanessa can become invisible, Catty travels back in time, Serena reads minds, and Jimena has premonitions. What separates them from others bands them together as Daughters of the Moon.\"\n\n\"Vanessa, Serena, Jimena, Catty and Tianna are five seemingly ordinary girls from Los Angeles. But the truth is that they are all far from ordinary. They each have a secret power that separates them from others - and makes them Daughters of the Moon.\"\n\nA blonde Daughter of the Moon and Daughter of Pandora, who stars in \"Goddess of the Night\" (Book #1), \"Moon Demon\" (Book #7) where she finds out that she started to fall in love with what Jimena's grandmother called the devil, and \"The Final Eclipse\" (Book #13). As a Daughter of the Moon, she is able to expand her molecules and become invisible. Occasionally, she can move objects while she is invisible, but it takes a lot of concentration. Originally, Vanessa was cautious about using her power, which caused her to have very poor control over it. However, throughout the series, she becomes more comfortable using it although she is still affected by strong emotions, such as fear. She lives with her mother, a Hollywood costume designer. Her father was a stunt coordinator who died when she was five in an accident. Vanessa is portrayed as being intelligent and always trying to see the best of people, such as Morgan Page who is consistently rude to Vanessa's other friends. Her best friend is Catty Turner, whom she has known since they were both children. She dates Michael Saratoga on and off throughout the series. In book 4, she starts to date Toby, a Regulator, who wants the Secret Scroll destroyed but he endangers all of the girls, including Vanessa. Fortunately, he is ultimately killed in the end. In book 7, Vanessa starts to date a mysterious guy named Hector, who later turns out to be a moon demon. He tries to marry her so she can live with him for eternity, but she frees him from his bonds to the Atrox, causing his death. In the same book, Vanessa reveals a talent for singing and joins Michael's band. Also her birthday is revealed to be November 14. In book 13, Vanessa returns from Nefandus after being held prisoner there for many months and discovers her 17th birthday is a few days away. After she helps to defeat the Atrox she is faced with the choice of becoming a guardian spirit or losing her memories of what she is and her powers. She makes the choice of losing her memories and her powers.\n\nSerena has long dark hair with red tips in the beginning of the series then she goes her natural dark brown. She has green eyes, and 3 piercings; one in her tongue, one in her nose, and one in her belly button. She is a Daughter of both Selene and Hekate resulting in her being a goddess of the moon and a goddess of the dark. She lives with her brother, Collin Killingsworth. Her best friend is Jimena, a fellow goddess. She stars in Into the Cold Fire (Book #2), and Possession (Book #8). She is the only Daughter to have the choice to become a goddess of the dark because she is the key to the balance of good or evil. She has the ability to read and cloud minds, powers similar to the Atrox's. She also has the ability to open and close portals. Serena continues to pursue an on and off relationship with Stanton, a Follower of the Atrox who later becomes the Prince of Night. Stanton is constantly worried because being with Serena can get them both killed by the Regulators. In the end, after she helps to defeat the Atrox, Serena has to make the choice of losing her memories of what she is and her powers, becoming a guardian spirit, or becoming the goddess of the dark. Stanton asks Serena to rule by his side and become the goddess of the dark and she accepts his offer. She stays in Nefandus with Stanton to make it a world of light.\n\nDaughter of the Moon and former member of an LA gang. She is Mexican and holds the power of premonition, seeing into the future. She lives with her grandmother in an apartment. Jimena used to be an incredibly tough hood rat with a gang from her neighborhood, Ninth Street, or el Nueve, until she learned of her destiny. Her old gang name Risky is tattooed on her hip. She was sentenced to Youth Camp twice, and has two tear mark tattoos, one for each time. She also has a three dots on the webbing of her thumb from when she joined her gang. Later in the series, Jimena has Catty give her another tattoo of a moon and star on her arm. After facing Followers together and seeing that Serena would always have her back, she and Jimena become best friends. In book 3 she begins dating Collin Killingsworth, Serena's older brother. As the series goes on, it is revealed that Jimena is actually a year older than her friends, so she is the forced to be the first to make the choice of losing her memories of what she is and her powers, or becoming a guardian spirit. Eventually she chooses to stay mortal because she both saw a premonition of her death and realized how much of the world she had yet to experience. Maggie, the Daughters' mentor, explains that Jimena's premonition was not of her death, but of the end of her time as a Daughter. On her last day as a Daughter, she was given the Medusa stone to protect her from enchantment and evil spirits. She then becomes a mortal and completely forgets her life as a Daughter. However, later in the series, it is established that she is the reincarnation of the moon goddess Pandia who was Maggie's and the other early daughters' mentor. She now serves as the new mentor for her friends after Maggie's death and to other future daughters.\n\nDaughter of the Moon and heiress to the Secret Scroll, starring in \"The Secret Scroll\" (Book #4) and \"The Prophecy\" (Book #11). Catty has the power to travel back and forth through time (\"chronokinesis\"). She was abandoned by her birth mother, Zoe Reese, who was a Daughter of the Moon with the powers of telekinesis. She was picked up by Kendra Turner on the side of the road. Kendra originally thought because of Catty's power, that Catty was an alien so she adopted her as her own, to protect her. Kendra is very lax with Catty and does not mind when Catty misses class in order to \"hop\" time. Catty's best friend is Vanessa and unlike her, she is not shy about using her power. Much to Vanessa's chagrin, Catty often uses it in public places and does not care about how her time hops affect people. Unlike Vanessa who tries to be cautious and cool, Catty is often wild and impulsive.\n\nAn ambition of Catty's is to find her biological mother and she manages to do so in \"The Secret Scroll\". There, she finds out that her mother became Follower of the Atrox and that her biological father is a member of the Atrox's inner circle. Later, it is revealed that Catty's birth name is Atertra Adamantis, which means \"black diamond\". From her mother, Catty inherits the Secret Scroll and finds it is her destiny to destroy the Atrox with it. Chris (also known as Chriysippus), the Keeper of the Secret Scroll and Catty's ex-boyfriend, helps her find the Scroll but almost loses his life, because it was intertwined with the scroll which Catty ultimately destroys in one of the later books.\n\nIn \"Prophecy\", Catty meets her father who offers her a place with the Atrox. She declines. She also begins to date, Kyle Ormond, who was once enslaved in Nefandus. By the Barbarian (Sons of the Dark !), they had broken up cause Catty discovers that their destinies are intertwined. She is spared by the Atrox after Tianna rebinds it to it's shadow cause her father convinced the Atrox that Catty would join them. Catty accepts and gains new powers from her father and the Atrox, much to the shock of her friends but is revealed she is actually planning to destroy the Atrox from the inside. She lies to the Atrox and pretends to have captured the Sons of the Dark, gaining a place in the Inner Circle. She ultimately succeeds in destroying the Atrox but sacrifices her life in the process.\n\nA girl with the powers of telekinesis who can also use that power to go into other dimensions, she first shows up in \"The Lost One\" (Book #6) and in \"The Becoming\" (Book #12). She becomes a Daughter of the Moon after she helps Catty get out of Nefandus, the realm of the Atrox. When she first shows up \"The Lost One\", she has no memory of who she is or where she came from. Ultimately, she pieces together the facts: she grew up in foster homes all over LA because her parents and little sister, Jamie, were killed by Followers when she was a child. She also begins to date a boy named Derek who knows the Daughters secrets. Their relationship last until \"The Becoming\". The foster mother she lives with is discovered to be a failed creation by the Atrox. Tianna was created by the Atrox and thus was born without a soul, but Selene kidnapped her when she was a baby and gave her to a Daughter. Her mother gave her moon dew so that Tianna would have a soul and become as human as possible. Her evil destiny is to become the wife of the Atrox and give birth to its child. Her good destiny, created with the help of Selene and her mother, is to rebind the Atrox to it's shadow. In book 12, Tianna re-binds the Atrox, which was in its most powerful form as a human, to its shadow form. In doing so, she destroys herself. Before the Atrox could get her soul, Selene saves her soul.\n\nAn L.A. Follower who becomes the Prince of the Night who stars in the book \"The Sacrifice\" (Book #5). He was an invitus, someone who unwillingly came to the Atrox in the 13th Century. His father, a prince, was hunting the Atrox, leaving Stanton at home. Unfortunately, while the prince was away, the Atrox took Stanton to scare his father from ever attempting to destroy it again. In \"Goddess of the Night\"(Book #1), he shows Vanessa his memory of his kidnapping. In his memory, she attempts to free him and for that act of kindness, he can never hurt her. He is in love with Serena, even though their love for each other is forbidden. In \"The Sacrifice\", he becomes free as a Follower at last, but chooses to go back to the Atrox in order to save Serena. In doing this, he is able to trap Lambert in his memory, and is awarded the status of Prince of the Night. With that status, he can order the Regulators not to hurt Serena and occasionally, her friends. He helps the Daughters throughout the series because of his devotion to Serena. He gave Tianna the sword to bind the Atrox to its shadow, helped in the disguise of monk so that Kyle escape, and visited Serena and Vanessa while they were held captive in Nefandus. Stanton helps Vanessa and Catty destroy the Atrox and save Serena. After the Atrox is destroyed, he becomes the new leader in Nefandus with Serena by his side. He also helped Vanessa in the 7th book by warning her about Hector and sending her a protector/follower that looked like Michael.\n\nShe was the Daughters' mentor and taught them how to control their respective powers. In \"The Talisman\" (Book #10), we find more about her past. Maggie was born in Athens, Greece as Penelope. She is an illegitimate child of Zeus and grew up with her adoptive father and sister, Taemestra. As Penelope grew devoted to Selene, her sister became a follower of the Atrox. She fell in love with a young, handsome soldier named Hector, who later became captured by the Atrox and became the moon demon who tried to marry Vanessa in book 7. Maggie managed to bind the Atrox to its shadow form for the first time, Tianna being the second. Also near the end of \"The Talisman\", Maggie discovers she is pregnant with Hectors child. \n\nAngered by her sister's choice and Hector's transformation, she asked Selene to live long enough to see the Atrox destroyed. However, before Selene could grant her wish, the Atrox overheard and granted it. Unfortunately for Maggie, she had forgotten to ask for perpetual youth, but Selene gave her an elixir that would keep her young. When the Atrox visited her, she said an incantation to destroy it but it backfired to destroy her instead, as it was not her destiny to destroy the Atrox. Before she can warn the Daughters and contact Jimena, who is the next mentor to the Daughters, her body is destroyed by the incantation and her soul moves on.\n\nThe Atrox is the enemy of The Daughters of the Moon. It wants to unleash diseases, terror and other horrible things. But to unleash these terrible things it must destroy the Daughters of the Moon. It created Tianna Moore, and protected Vanessa Cleveland. In the End the Atrox ends up being defeated by Catty Turner.\n\nMorgan is introduced in \"Goddess of the Night\" as a wealthy, narrow-minded, and snobbish socialite friend of Vanessa's. Catty, Jimena, and Serena dislike her, mostly due to the fact that her mind seems encompassed around nothing but boys and clothes although Vanessa once noticed that Morgan is deliberately trying to be care free to cover up her own insecurities. However, she is snide and rude, criticizing Serena Killingsworth, on her unique fashion sense although Serena once penetrated her mind and saw that Morgan was jealous of Serena's talent on the cello. She meets Stanton at Planet Bang, and begins dating him, unaware of his status as a Follower.

Serena enacts vengeance on Morgan for criticizing her [Serena] behind her back, by manipulating Morgan's thought during a pep rally speech. Morgan delivers a humorous, off the topic speech about how she stuffed her bra during a party. Enraged and somehow knowing Serena was behind it, she confronts Serena. Later on, they stumble into each other, and in the end of the book, is seen fleeing with Followers, implying she's one of them (as Zahi, an Immortal Follower, had been courting her, too).\n\nIn Night Shade, Morgan is a part of a scheme by Cassandra in which she, Morgan, and Karyl plot to destroy the Daughters, focusing mainly on Jimena Castillo.

Throughout the centuries, he was the keeper of the secret scroll, which he later gives to Catty. He fell in love with her in \"The Secret Scroll\" (Book #4). He disappears, but comes back to help Jimena in \"The Choice\" (Book #9). In \"The Prophecy\" (Book #11), he is held prisoner by Catty's father.

Unfortunately for her, she fails the Atrox and becomes an Outcast. She is seen on and off throughout the books, causing trouble and such, in an attempt to win Stanton.\n\nKyle is Catty's boyfriend during \"The Prophecy\" (Book #11) and \"The Becoming\" (Book #12). He is first described as a gorgeous high school boy who attracts girls despite his reputation as a magnet for trouble. It is later revealed that he is a \"servus\", a slave in Nefandus. As a \"servus\", Kyle has the ability to read minds. He is also under a curse that forces him to kill any non-resident of Nefandus that he tries to kiss by slowly absorbing her power. He first stepped into Nefandus to save a friend who had been lured into the realm with promises of learning magic, only to become captured and enslaved himself. Kyle escaped with the help of a monk (Stanton in disguise) who showed him the portals and told him the myth of a black diamond that could set him free. In pursuit of this jewel and his freedom, he is tricked by Adamantis into bringing Catty into Nefandus, inadvertently putting her in danger.

Stanton imprisoned him in his memories of the Atrox but Aura, Lambert's lover, possessed Serena to get close to Stanton and use Serena's powers to free Lambert. After Stanton destroyed him in book 5, he becomes a sphere of light that can possess anyone. He is also known as Darius.\n\nAura Triton is Lambert's lover. She was born in A.D. 1223 to a peasant father, with a jewel clutched in her hands, which subsequently disappeared. Her fate was thus sealed: all good would slip through her fingers. Aura, known then as Ursula, became renowned for her unearthly beauty, attracting even the Atrox, who offered her father great treasures if she would betroth it. Seeing her father's poverty, Ursula agreed to the marriage and pledged her devotion for all of eternity, asking only that her beauty should last forever. Yet when Lambert, a follower, came to bring her to the underworld, he fell desperately in love with her, and she with him. Despite attempts to hide their love, the Atrox saw through her deception. When she stepped into the cold fire to receive immortality, the flames destroyed her flesh and bones, reducing her to a wind spirit. Using a potion that Lambert procures from the ancient enchantress Circe, she then lives on by possessing other people and switching bodies whenever the one she possesses becomes old. Aura appears in \"Possession\" (Book #8), when she begins taking over Serena's body in an attempt to use her powers to free Lambert from Stanton's memories. Other individuals that Aura has possessed include the starlet Ann Anderson and ex-follower Morgan Page.\n\nTymmie and Karyl are two of the first Followers that the Daughters encounter in the series. They were once apprenticed to Stanton but since Stanton's appointment as Prince of the Night, Karyl has not been mentioned. However, Tymmie joins Lambert.

Despite being on the same side of the Daughters, he never loved Catty and tried to have Stanton destroyed. Vanessa fights him and defeats him. He leaves Nefandus but it is unknown whether or not he is in Earth's Realm.His goal is to stay with Catty.\n\nZoe is Catty's biological mother and a former Daughter of the Moon with the power of telekinesis. She became frightened of her impending metamorphosis and turned to the Atrox, who promised her the gift of immortality. However, the Atrox sensed that her commitment was made out of fear and tricked her. Zoe had failed to ask for perpetual youth. From the moment she turned immortal, she was condemned to age for all of eternity. She first blamed Maggie for her misfortune but eventually comes to accept that her fate was due to her own lack of courage. As a follower, Zoe falls in love with Adamantis and gives birth to his child Atertra, later known as Catty. In order to protect her daughter from Regulators and from her destiny as heiress to the Secret Scroll, she abandons Catty on the side of a deserted highway after having Stanton remove her childhood memories. She then settles near Catty and watches over her without daring to reveal her presence, for fear that she would put her daughter in danger. Because she has done so much to protect Catty, Selene visits her in her dreams and welcomes her soul, offering her a second chance. Zoe accepts this offer after she has a discussion with Catty and leaves her body behind to become a spirit.\n\n\n01. Goddess of the Night (2000) <br>\n02. Into the Cold Fire (2000) <br>\n03.

The novel is a literary thriller, social satire, and dark comedy about America's obsession with sex, celebrity, and the internet, which explores a pornography addict’s unwilling relationship with a woman who thinks she can speak to God and their entanglement with sex traffickers that cater to the Hollywood elite. Grothaus has stated that his personal experiences at the Cannes Film Festival and his disillusionment with the Hollywood film industry were strong inspiration for the novel.\n\nThe novel’s protagonist is Jerry Dresden an employee at the Art Institute of Chicago who suffers from a porn addiction as well as psychotic depression. Both are the result of the tragic deaths of his little sister and high-flying Hollywood father years earlier. As a result of his psychotic depression, Jerry suffers from psychotic delusions which make him see people who don’t really exist—people Jerry calls \"figments\". His mundane but stable life is interrupted one day when his colleague at the museum is murdered and a famous painting by Vincent Van Gogh (\"Self-Portrait\", Spring 1887) is stolen. Returning from work that night Jerry finds the stolen painting in his apartment and the next day he discovers that a woman who he thought was just one of his figments his entire life turns out to be a real person.\n\nThis former figment tells Jerry her name is Epiphany Jones and admits she stole the painting and killed Jerry’s colleague in order to frame him and blackmails him into helping her find someone she is looking for. Left with no choice, Jerry flees with her to Mexico, then Portugal, and finally to the Cannes Film Festival in France as Epiphany, which says the voice of God is speaking to her and telling her what to do, tracks down a sex trafficking ring that caters to the Hollywood elite. Along the way, Jerry discovers Epiphany is not all she seems to be as their journey grows increasingly fraught with danger and he discovers secrets about both their pasts that will change his life forever.\n\nEpiphany Jones received positive reviews in the mainstream press and on book blogs. The Bookseller described the novel as \"an energetic, inventive, gritty and deeply moving thriller cum dark comedy, \"Epiphany Jones\" addresses the challenging subject of sex trafficking in a powerful narrative driven by exceptionally well-drawn, unforgettable protagonists.\" The Sunday Express named \"Epiphany Jones\" as one of the 'Best Reads for the Summer', calling it \"gloriously funny but dark as hell.\" The Guardian named it one of the best recent novels, saying \"Epiphany Jones\" is \"complex, inventive and a genuine shocker, this is the very opposite of a 'comfort' read.\" Literary critic Maxim Jakubowski called \"Epiphany Jones\" \"a truly impressive debut\" and \"a twisting tale at the same time realistically gripping and sardonic\" and praised Grothaus' writing for having \"a delicate fluency which contrasts with the depravity of his subject matter.\" The New York Daily News said \"Epiphany Jones\" \"is a captivating story that manages to be funny, sinister and surprising\" and praised Grothaus' main characters as \"complex and well-rounded—equal parts sympathetic, mad and maddening.\"\n\nIn 2018 Entertainment Weekly named \"Epiphany Jones\" one of the 25 \"Most Irresistible Hollywood Novels\" of the last 100 years alongside novels by Joyce Carol Oates, Evelyn Waugh, Gore Vidal, Norman Mailer, and F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nIn May 2017 Epiphany Jones was long-listed for the 2017 CWA New Blood Dagger Award.\n\nIn 2018, Entertainment Weekly named \"Epiphany Jones\" one of the 25 \"Most Irresistible Hollywood Novels.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "9760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9760", "title": "Eschatology", "text": "Eschatology\n\nEschatology is a part of theology concerned with the final events of history, or the ultimate destiny of humanity. This concept is commonly referred to as the \"end of the world\" or \"end times\".\n\nThe word arises from the Greek \"eschatos\" meaning \"last\" and \"-logy\" meaning \"the study of\", and first appeared in English around 1844. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines eschatology as \"the part of theology concerned with death, judgment, and the final destiny of the soul and of humankind\".\n\nIn the context of mysticism, the term refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary reality and to reunion with the Divine. Many religions treat eschatology as a future event prophesied in sacred texts or in folklore.\n\nHistory is often divided into \"ages\" (aeons), which are time periods each with certain commonalities. One age comes to an end and a new age or world to come, where different realities are present, begins. When such transitions from one age to another are the subject of eschatological discussion, the phrase, \"end of the world\", is replaced by \"end of the age\", \"end of an era\", or \"end of life as we know it\". Much apocalyptic fiction does not deal with the \"end of time\" but rather with the end of a certain period, the end of life as it is now, and the beginning of a new period. It is usually a crisis that brings an end to current reality and ushers in a new way of living, thinking, or being. This crisis may take the form of the intervention of a deity in history, a war, a change in the environment, or the reaching of a new level of consciousness.\n\nMost modern eschatology and apocalypticism, both religious and secular, involve the violent disruption or destruction of the world; whereas Christian and Jewish eschatologies view the end times as the consummation or perfection of God's creation of the world, albeit with violent overtures, such as the Great Tribulation. For example, according to some ancient Hebrew worldviews, reality unfolds along a linear path (or rather, a spiral path, with cyclical components that nonetheless have a linear trajectory); the world began with God and is ultimately headed toward God's final goal for creation, the world to come.\n\nEschatologies vary as to their degree of optimism or pessimism about the future. In some eschatologies, conditions are better for some and worse for others, e.g. \"heaven and hell\". They also vary as to time frames. Groups claiming \"imminent\" eschatology are also referred to as Doomsday cults.\n\nIn Bahá'í belief, creation has neither a beginning nor an end. Instead, the eschatology of other religions is viewed as symbolic. In Bahá'í belief, human time is marked by a series of progressive revelations in which successive messengers or prophets come from God. The coming of each of these messengers is seen as the day of judgment to the adherents of the previous religion, who may choose to accept the new messenger and enter the \"heaven\" of belief, or denounce the new messenger and enter the \"hell\" of denial. In this view, the terms \"heaven\" and \"hell\" are seen as symbolic terms for the person's spiritual progress and their nearness to or distance from God. In Bahá'í belief, the coming of Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, signals the fulfilment of previous eschatological expectations of Islam, Christianity and other major religions.\n\nChristian eschatology is the study concerned with the ultimate destiny of the individual soul and the entire created order, based primarily upon biblical texts within the Old and New Testament.\n\nChristian eschatology looks to study and discuss matters such as death and the afterlife, Heaven and Hell, the Second Coming of Jesus, the resurrection of the dead, the Rapture, the Tribulation, Millennialism, the end of the world, the Last Judgment, and the New Heaven and New Earth in the world to come.\n\nEschatological passages are found in many places in the Bible, both in the Old and the New Testaments. In the Old Testament, apocalyptic eschatology can be found notably in Isaiah 24–27, Isaiah 56–66, Joel, Zechariah 9–14 as well as closing chapters of Daniel, and Ezekiel. In the New Testament, applicable passages include Matthew 24, Mark 13, the parable of \"The Sheep and the Goats\" and in the Book of Revelation—although Revelation often occupies a central place in Christian eschatology.\n\nThe Second Coming of Christ is the central event in Christian eschatology within the broader context of the fullness of the Kingdom of God. Most Christians believe that death and suffering will continue to exist until Christ's return. There are, however, various views concerning the order and significance of other eschatological events.\n\nThe Book of Revelation is at the core of Christian eschatology. The study of Revelation is usually divided into four interpretative methodologies or hermeneutics. In the Futurist approach, Revelation is treated mostly as unfulfilled prophecy taking place in some yet undetermined future. In the Preterist approach, Revelation is chiefly interpreted as having prophetic fulfillment in the past. , principally, the events of the first century CE. \n\nIn the Historicist approach, Revelation provides a broad view of history, and passages in Revelation are identified with major historical people and events. This is view the Jewish scholars held, along with the early Christian church, and it was prevalent in Wycliffe's writings, and other Reformers such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, \nJohn Wesley, and Sir Isaac Newton, and many others. \n\nIn the Idealist approach, the events of Revelation are neither past nor future, but are purely symbolic, dealing with the ongoing struggle and ultimate triumph of good over evil.\n\nContemporary Hindu eschatology is linked in the Vaishnavite tradition to the figure of Kalki, the tenth and last avatar of Vishnu before the age draws to a close who will reincarnate as Shiva and simultaneously dissolve and regenerate the universe.\n\nMost Hindus believe that the current period is the Kali Yuga, the last of four \"Yuga\" that make up the current age. Each period has seen successive degeneration in the moral order, to the point that in the Kali Yuga quarrel and hypocrisy are the norm. In Hinduism, time is cyclic, consisting of cycles or \"kalpas\". Each kalpa lasts 4.1 – 8.2 billion years, which is one full day and night for Brahma, who in turn will live for 311 trillion, 40 billion years. The cycle of birth, growth, decay, and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order, yet is affected by vagaries of divine intervention in Vaishnavite belief. Some Shaivites hold the view that Shiva is incessantly destroying and creating the world.\n\nIslamic eschatology is documented in the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, regarding the Signs of the Day of Judgement. The Prophet's sayings on the subject have been traditionally divided into Major and Minor Signs. He spoke about several Minor Signs of the approach of the Day of Judgment, including:\n\nRegarding the Major Signs, a Companion of the Prophet narrated: \"Once we were sitting together and talking amongst ourselves when the Prophet appeared. He asked us what it was we were discussing. We said it was the Day of Judgment. He said: 'It will not be called until ten signs have appeared: Smoke, Dajjal (the Antichrist), the creature (that will wound the people), the rising of the sun in the West, the Second Coming of Jesus, the emergence of Gog and Magog, and three sinkings (or cavings in of the earth): one in the East, another in the West and a third in the Arabian Peninsula.'\" (note: the previous events were not listed in the chronological order of appearance)\n\nJewish eschatology is concerned with events that will happen in the end of days, according to the Hebrew Bible and Jewish thought. This includes the ingathering of the exiled diaspora, the coming of the Jewish Messiah, afterlife, and the revival of the dead Tzadikim.\n\nIn Judaism, the end times are usually called the \"end of days\" (\"aḥarit ha-yamim\", אחרית הימים), a phrase that appears several times in the Tanakh. The idea of a messianic age has a prominent place in Jewish thought and is incorporated as part of the end of days.\n\nJudaism addresses the end times in the Book of Daniel and numerous other prophetic passages in the Hebrew scriptures, and also in the Talmud, particularly Tractate Avodah Zarah.\n\nFrashokereti is the Zoroastrian doctrine of a final renovation of the universe when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will then be in perfect unity with God (Ahura Mazda). The doctrinal premises are (1) good will eventually prevail over evil; (2) creation was initially perfectly good, but was subsequently corrupted by evil; (3) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation; (4) the \"salvation for the individual depended on the sum of [that person's] thoughts, words and deeds, and there could be no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this.\" Thus, each human bears the responsibility for the fate of his own soul, and simultaneously shares in the responsibility for the fate of the world.\n\nResearchers in futures studies and transhumanists investigate how the accelerating rate of scientific progress may lead to a \"technological singularity\" in the future that would profoundly and unpredictably change the course of human history, and result in \"Homo sapiens\" no longer being the dominant life form on Earth.\n\nOccasionally the term \"physical eschatology\" is applied to the long-term predictions of astrophysics. The Sun will turn into a red giant in approximately 6 billion years. Life on Earth will become impossible due to a rise in temperature long before the planet is actually swallowed up by the Sun. Even later, the Sun will become a white dwarf.\n\n"}

As an example, the Ancient Egyptian Wag Festival took place in early August.\n\nIn Japanese Buddhist custom the festival honoring the departed (deceased) spirits of one's ancestors is known as the Bon Festival and is held in July or August. This annual festival begins with participants flocking towards the ocean with gifts, messages and lit lanterns for the deceased. All of these gifts are found in small boats which are then released into the water at midnight. \n\nFor the Hindus the ritual done for the dead ancestors is called Pitri Paksha. It is based on the Hindu lunar calendar and the period lasts for 15 days, falling towards the end of September. In Nepal, the popular festival of Gai Jatra honors the deceased, and is observed in the month of Bhadra, the date of which corresponds to the first day of the month of Gunla in the lunar Nepal Era calendar.\n\nThe Roman Catholic church celebrates three days of Allhallowtide from 31 October to 1 November, marking All Saints' Eve, All Saints' Day and the second of November as All Souls' Day. The Mexican holiday celebrated at Hallowtide is called Dia de Los Muertos or Day of the Dead - prior to the Spanish colonisation and the conversion of local people to Christianity, this festival was celebrated in the summer time.\n\nIn many cultures a single event, \"Festival of the Dead\", lasting up to 3 days, was held at the end of October and beginning of November; examples include the Peruvians, the Pacific Islanders, the people of the Tonga Islands, the ancient Persians, ancient Romans, and the northern nations of Europe. \n\nIn the Inca religion the entire month of November is 'Ayamarca', which translates to \"Festival of the Dead\". The Chinese and Buddhist festival is called Ghost Festival.\n\nIn the 21st century, European traditions mark the celebrations of Halloween.\n\nIt has been thought that the three day festival of the dead is a ritualistic remembrance of the deluge in which the first night, Halloween depicts the wickedness of the world before flood. The second night then celebrates the saved who survived the deluge and the last night celebrates those who would repopulate the Earth.\n\n"}

Calouros are often subject to hazing, which is known as \"trote\" (lit. \"prank\") there. The first known hazing episode in Brazil happened 1831 at the Law School of Olinda and resulted in the death of a student. In 1999, a Chinese Brazilian calouro of the University of São Paulo Medicine School named Edison Tsung Chi Hsueh was found dead at the institution's swimming pool; this has since become one of the most well known episodes of violent hazing and has received extensive national media coverage since that year.\n\nIn Scotland, the first year of compulsory education is Primary 1 (P1). The first year of secondary school is known as \"S1\" but one can freely use \"first year\".\n\nAt the four ancient Scottish universities the traditional names for the four years at university are Bejan (\"Bejant\" at the University of St Andrews)(1st), Semi (2nd), Tertian (3rd) and Magistrand (4th), though all Scottish universities will have a \"freshers' week\" (as with all British universities) and the term is as widely used with more traditional terms.\n\nFreshman is commonly in use as a US English idiomatic term to describe a beginner or novice, someone who is naive, a first effort, instance, or a student in the first year of study (generally referring to high school or university study).\n\nNew members of Congress in their first term are referred to as \"freshmen senators\" or \"freshmen congressmen or congresswomen\", no matter how experienced they were in previous government positions.\n\nHigh school first year students are almost exclusively referred to as freshmen, or in some cases by their grade year, 9th graders. Second year students are sophomores, or 10th graders, then juniors or 11th graders, and finally seniors or 12th graders.\n\nAt college or university, freshman denotes students in their first year of study.

{"id": "24215198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24215198", "title": "Gargee'an", "text": "Gargee'an\n\nGargee'an (), sometimes spelled as Gerga'oon (Arabic: قرقاعون), is a semiannual celebration, observed primarily in Eastern Arabia (Arab states of the Persian Gulf), Iraq, and the Khuzestan region in Iran. It takes place on the 15th night of the Islamic month of Sha'ban and on the 15th night of Ramadan. Gargee'an is marked with children dressing in traditional attire and going door-to-door to receive sweets and nuts from neighbours, whilst also singing traditional songs. The tradition has existed for hundreds of years and deeply rooted in Gulf culture.\n\nAlthough the celebration of Gargee'an shares superficial similarities with the Halloween custom of trick-or-treating, practiced in some western countries, Gargee'an has no connection with horror and no associated origin with Halloween.\n\nThe exact origin of the word \"Qarqī'ān\" is unknown though several theories exist; One such theory states that it is derived from \"Qarqa'ah\" (), which means \"click\" or \"snick\", the sound of iron pots carrying the sweets hitting each other while serving the sweets. Another theory says that it could originate from the kids of Medina singing \"Qarrat Al-'Ain, Qarrat Al-'Ain\" (Arabic: قرة العين) which was changed with time to \"Qarqī'ān\".\n\nThe holiday is also known by several different names in each region: Majeena or Karkiaan in Iraq, Garangao or Garangaou in Qatar and Bahrain, Karkee'aan or Qariqaan in Saudi Arabia, Gargee'aan in Kuwait, Garangashoch, At-Tablah or Qarnakosh in Oman, and Hag Al Leylah in the UAE.\n\nBoth Gerga'oon nights are significant to both Sunni and Shia Muslims. Gerga'oon on the 15th of Sha'ban marks the birthday of Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi, the 12th Imam. Gerga'oon on the 15th of Ramadan coincides with the birth of Imam Hasan ibn Ali, the second Imam in Shia Islam. As a result, the occasion is seen as a time of happiness and festivities by Shia Muslims, particularly in Bahrain.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO), describes ‘Gross Enrolment Ratio’ as the total enrolment within a country ‘in a specific level of education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population in the official age group corresponding to this level of education.’\n\nThe GER can be over 100% as it includes students who may be older or younger than the official age group. For instance, the GER includes students who are repeating a grade, those who enrolled late and are older than their classmates, or those who have advanced quickly and are younger than their classmates. This allows the total enrollment to exceed the population that corresponds to that level of education.\n\nA combined gross enrolment ratio (CGER), incorporating all three levels of education, was used to calculate the Human Development Index (HDI), an annual gauge of well-being for UN member states, from 1990 to 2009. Amongst other measures used in the calculation, the CGER was given one-third weight in assessing the knowledge component, represented by gross enrolment, while the adult literacy rate was given two-thirds weight.\n\nhttp://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/\nhttp://www.worldbank.org/depweb/english/beyond/global/glossary.html\n"}
{"id": "22900852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22900852", "title": "History of art criticism", "text": "History of art criticism\n\nThe history of art criticism, as part of art history, is the study of objects of art in their historical development and stylistic contexts, i.e. genre, design, format, and style, which include aesthetic considerations. This includes the \"major\" arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture as well as the \"minor\" arts of ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.\n\nAs a term, the history of art history (also history of art) encompasses several methods of studying and assessing the visual arts; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian Ernst Gombrich once observed, \"the field of art history [is] much like Caesar's Gaul, divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the connoisseurs, (ii) the critics, and (iii) the academic art historians\".\n\nAs a discipline, the history of art criticism is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement from the standpoint of its history and of its major scholars. It is also distinguished from art theory or \"philosophy of art\", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is aesthetics, which includes investigating the enigma of the sublime and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses historical method to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and How did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. Unfortunately the current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this.\n\nThe history of art criticism is not only a biographical endeavor. The history of art criticism often roots its studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. It attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?\n\nThe historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a \"canon\" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.\n\nThe history of art criticism as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on formal analysis, semiotics, psychoanalysis and iconography. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding context, form, and social significance.\n\nArt historians, in performing their assessment within the history of art criticism, employ a number of methods in their research into the ontology and history of objects.\n\nPractitioners of art criticism often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and symbolism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.\n\nPractitioners of art criticism also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of line, shape, color, texture, and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a two-dimensional picture plane or the three dimensions of sculptural or architectural space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in representational or non-representational art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is \"realistic\". Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called abstract. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. Impressionism is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an \"impression\" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of expressionism.\n\nAn iconographical analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these motifs. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.\n\nMany practitioners of art criticism use critical theory to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from literary scholars, and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. Feminist, Marxist, critical race, queer, and postcolonial theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.\n\nMore recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.\n\nThe earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history or art criticism are the passages in Pliny the Elder's \"Natural History\" (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of Greek sculpture and painting. From them it is possible to trace the ideas of Xenokrates of Sicyon (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian. Pliny's work, while mainly an encyclopaedia of the sciences, has thus been influential from the Renaissance onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter Apelles c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the \"Six Principles of Painting\" formulated by Xie He.\n\nWhile personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see Lorenzo Ghiberti \"Commentarii,\" for the best early example), it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the \"Lives of the Painters\", who wrote the first true \"history\" of art. He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was Michelangelo, and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased in places.\n\nVasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe Karel van Mander's \"Schilder-boeck\" and Joachim von Sandrart's \"Teutsche Akademie\". Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.\n\nScholars such as Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's \"cult\" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were \"Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst, published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome (Fuseli published an English translation in 1765 under the title Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks), and Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (History of Art in Antiquity), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)\". Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of Baroque and Rococo forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober Neoclassicism. Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.\n\nWinckelmann was read avidly by Johann Wolfgang Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the Laocoon occasioned a response by Lessing. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of Immanuel Kant's \"Critique of Judgment\" in 1790, and was furthered by Hegel's \"Lectures on Aesthetics\". Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for Karl Schnaase's work. Schnaase's \"Niederländische Briefe\" established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his \"Geschichte der bildenden Künste\", one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by Franz Theodor Kugler.\n\nHeinrich Wölfflin (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the \"father\" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including Jakob Rosenberg and Frida Schottmuller. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of Wilhelm Wundt. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their façades looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of style. His book \"Renaissance and Baroque\" developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to Giorgio Vasari, Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an \"art history without names.\" Finally, he studied art based on ideas of nationhood. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently \"Italian\" and an inherently \"German\" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist Albrecht Dürer.\n\nContemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the University of Vienna. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by Alois Riegl and Franz Wickhoff, both students of Moritz Thausing, and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of late antiquity, which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.\n\nThe next generation of professors at Vienna included Max Dvořák, Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and Josef Strzygowski. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including Ernst Gombrich, received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term \"Second Vienna School\" (or \"New Vienna School\") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including Hans Sedlmayr, Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of \"Kunstwollen\", and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible formalism, and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.\n\nOur 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in Hamburg in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were Erwin Panofsky, Aby Warburg, and Fritz Saxl. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. \"Iconography\"—with roots meaning \"symbols from writing\" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. \"Iconology\" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.\n\nPanofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the University of Hamburg, where Panofsky taught.\n\nWarburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the Warburg Institute. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the Institute for Advanced Study. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.\n\nHeinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud wrote a book on the artist Leonardo da Vinci, in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's psyche and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably homosexual.\n\nThough the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, \"Art Across Time\", and a book \"Art and Psychoanalysis\".\n\nAn unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art. Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s \"Lives\". For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.\n\nCarl Jung also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. C.G. Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist, an influential thinker, and founder of analytical psychology. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the psyche through exploring the worlds of dreams, art, mythology, world religion and philosophy. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, alchemy, astrology, sociology, as well as literature and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological archetype, the collective unconscious, and his theory of synchronicity. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as coincidence were not merely due to chance but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic. He argued that a collective unconscious and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American Abstract expressionists in the 1940s and 1950s. His work inspired the surrealist concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.\n\nJung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. Jackson Pollock, for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.\n\nThe legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyone Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With Griselda Pollock's reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of Julia Kristeva and Bracha L. Ettinger, as with Rosalind Krauss readings of Jacques Lacan and Jean-François Lyotard and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, Feminist theory written in the fields of French feminism and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.\n\nDuring the mid-20th century, art historians embraced social history by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural (ideology).\n\nPerhaps the best-known Marxist was Clement Greenberg, who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay \"Avant-Garde and Kitsch\". In the essay Greenberg claimed that the avant-garde arose in order to defend aesthetic standards from the decline of taste involved in consumer society, and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that avant-garde and Modernist art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by capitalist propaganda. Greenberg appropriated the German word 'kitsch' to describe this consumerism, although its connotations have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.\n\nMeyer Schapiro is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, at which time he saw evidence of capitalism emerging and feudalism declining.\n\nArnold Hauser wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled \"The Social History of Art\". He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called \"vulgar Marxism\".\n\nMarxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at UCLA with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. T.J. Clark was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon vulgar Marxism. He wrote Marxist art histories of several impressionist and realist artists, including Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.\n\nLinda Nochlin's essay \"Why have there been no great women artists?\" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. In it she applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training. Nochlin argues that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields. The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success.Griselda Pollock is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above. While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the feminist art movement, which referred specifically to the experience of women.\n\nAs opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, semiotics is concerned with how meaning is created. Roland Barthes’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of denoted meaning—the recognition of a visual sign, and the connoted meaning—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.\n\nSemiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a collective consciousness. Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, Meyer Schapiro borrowed Saussure’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system. According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a profile, or a three-quarter view. Schapiro combined this method with the work of Charles Sanders Peirce whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the Mona Lisa. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to Leonardo? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.\n\nSemiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it. Rosalind Krauss espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. Mieke Bal argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.\n\nAspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. Museum studies, including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.\n\nScientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially infra-red and x-ray photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of pigments used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. Dendrochronology for panel paintings and radio-carbon dating for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as illuminated manuscripts and Persian miniatures, and many types of archaeological artworks.\n\nThe field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in \"19th-century German architecture\" or in \"16th-century Tuscan sculpture.\" Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient Near East, Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of Ancient art. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus Korean art, for example).\n\nNon-Western art is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying Ancient Rome or the Italian Renaissance, scholars specializing in Africa, the Ancient Americas and Asia are a growing minority.\n\nContemporary Art History refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of modernism brought by artists of the neo-avant-garde and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on conceptualist and post-conceptualist practices.\n\nIn the United States, the most important art history organization is the College Art Association. It organizes an annual conference and publishes the \"Art Bulletin\" and \"Art Journal\". Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as architectural history and Renaissance art history. In the UK, for example, the Association of Art Historians is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled \"Art History\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20712834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20712834", "title": "History of flower arrangement", "text": "History of flower arrangement\n\nThe history of flower arrangement dates back to ancient Egyptian times.\n\nThe earliest known flower arranging dates back to ancient Egypt. Egyptians were decorating with flowers as early as 2,500 BCE. They regularly placed cut flowers in vases, and highly stylized arrangements were used during burials, for processions, and simply as table decorations. Illustrations of arranged flowers have been found on Egyptian carved stone reliefs and painted wall decorations.\n\nFlowers were selected according to symbolic meaning, with emphasis on religious significance. The lotus flower or water lily, for example, was considered sacred to Isis and was often included in arrangements. Many other flowers have been found in the tombs of the ancient Egyptians, and garlands of flowers were worn by loved ones and left at the tombs. These included blue scilla, poppy-flowered anemone, \"Iris sibirica\", delphinium, narcissus, palm tree, papyrus and rose. Egyptian wall paintings depicting roses have been found in tombs dating from the fifth century B.C. to Cleopatra’s time.\n\nThe Greeks and the Romans also used flowers. The ancient Greeks used flowers and herbs for adornment and decorations included in artwork. They did not often use vases, focusing instead on garlands and wreaths. They would place plant material, such as olive branches, in terracotta. The leafy branches were probably used for weddings. They also tossed petals onto floors and beds. Like the Egyptians, the Greeks and Romans had preferences for the flowers and foliage they used.\n\nThe most popular foliage used by the Greeks and the Romans were acorns, oak leaves, laurel, ivy, bay and parsley. Laurel wreaths were presented to winners of athletic competitions in the ancient Olympics; these wreaths were also awarded to individuals winning competition in poetic meets, while in Rome they symbolized a military victory and crowned the successful commander in honor of his triumph. The garland wreath was a symbol to the Greeks of power, honor, allegiance, dedication; it was awarded in honor of athletes, poets, civic leaders, soldier, and heroes.\n\nThe preferred flowers include roses, hyacinths, honeysuckle, violets, and lilies. Other flowers such as tulips, larkspur, and marigolds were also selected for their shape, color, and form.\n\nWealth and power led the Romans and Greeks to the greater luxury in the use of flowers which, like the Egyptian, were used in religious rites. At banquets, roses were strewn on the floor to a depth of one foot, and the flowers \"rained\" from the ceiling. The fragrance of so many roses was almost suffocating. The Romans used the roses at many meals and because of its overwhelming fragrance it was known as the \"Hour of Rose\". \n\nThe Chinese were making flower arrangements as far back as 207 BCE to 220 CE, in the Han era of ancient China. Flowers were an integral component of religious teaching and medicine.\n\nPractitioners of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism placed cut flowers on their altars, a practice which dates back to 618-906 CE. They created paintings, carvings, and embroidered items with depictions of flowers. The paintings can be found on vases, plates, scrolls, and silk, while carvings were done on wood, bronze, jade and ivory.\n\nBuddhist teachings forbade the taking of a life, so religious practitioners worked sparingly when taking cuttings from plants. Flowers and leaves that were used to make basket arrangements were selected based on their symbolic meaning. For example, the bamboo, the peach tree, and the pear tree symbolized longevity. The tiger lily, the pomegranate, and the orchid symbolized fertility. The most honored of all flowers was the peony. Considered the “king of flowers”, it symbolized wealth, good fortune, and high status.\n\nDuring the period 500CE to 1453CE, the Byzantine Empire made its contribution to floral arrangements, which typically included a cone shape design. The foliage was placed in chalices and urns, which were further decorated with brightly colored flowers and fruit. Flowers commonly included in these arrangements were daisies, lilies, cypress, carnations, and pine. Ribbons were also commonly used, and leaves and tiny flowers were set in arching lines to give an twisted effect to garlands.\n\nFlower arranging arrived in Europe around 1000 CE, and was particularly popular in churches and monasteries where flowers and plants were used for food as well as for decoration. As crusaders came back from the Middle East, they brought with them new and interesting plants. As a result, European countries began experimenting with plants that were previously unknown to them.\n\nMIDDLE AGES (\"AD 476–1400\")\n\nDuring this era, monks were known for having gardens with herbs and wildflowers. In the later part of the Gothic period flowers reached a more dominant role, such as flowers beginning to blossom in altar pictures, manuscripts, and paintings.\n\nAn important aspect of the monastery plan was to include a medicinal herb garden, which would “furnish the physician with the pharmaceutical products needed for his cures. A dependence on the power of herbs without reference to their Creator [God] was, however, regarded as improper for a Christian” [12]. Because God “causes herbs to grow,” their medical utility is fundamentally spiritual [13]. In addition, many plants were used by monks and Christians in general in sacred rituals and ceremonies. They often had associations appealing to spiritual bases as well as to medicinal effects.\n\nRENAISSANCE(\"AD 1400–1600\")\n\nThe flower design started in Italy and grew through Europe. Paintings of impressive floral arrangements in vases were popular. In the paintings, fruit blossoms and leaves were woven into garlands to decorate walls and vaulted ceilings, and petals were piled into baskets or strewn on the floors, streets, or allowed to float down from balconies.\n\nBAROQUE ARRANGEMENTS (\"AD 1600–1775\")\n\nAt the beginning of this period floral designs were symmetrical and oval-shaped, with asymmetric crescents and S-shapes becoming popular later on.\n\nDUTCH–FLEMISH ARRANGEMENTS (\"AD 1600–1750\")\n\nThe baroque arrangements in the Dutch-Flemish style were more compact and proportioned. Their major characteristic was the variety of flowers within the bouquet.\n\nFRENCH ARRANGEMENTS (\"AD 1600–1814\")\n\nDuring the French Baroque period, a soft, almost fragile appeal became a major characteristic of floral design. Arrangements were asymmetrical using the C-crescent or the S-shape. In the empire period they used simple lines in triangle shapes and strong color contrast. The typical empire design would be arranged in an urn containing an abundance of large richly colored flowers.\n\nGEORGIAN ARRANGEMENTS (\"AD 1714–1760\")\n\nThe designs in this period were formal and symmetrical and often tightly arranged with a variety of flowers. Oriental design became influential due to active trading. At the end of the period the designs became more informal due to the fact that the fragrance of the flowers, which were believed to rid the air of diseases, became more important. Small, handheld arrangements called nosegays or tussie-mussies were used to carry sweet scents, and also helped mask the odors of society where bathing was often believed to be unhealthy.\n\nVICTORIAN ARRANGEMENTS (\"AD 1820–1901\")\n\nFlowers were considered fashionable in this period. Large mass flowers were placed tightly into containers to create compact arrangements that were asymmetrical and stacked tightly. There was no definite style, but many different flowers and colours made the arrangement look almost unplanned. The tussie-mussie bouquets were still serving to eliminate odors. At the end of this period attempts were made to set up rules for a proper arranging of flowers, which is when it became an artful skill or profession in Europe.\n\nThe Italian Renaissance helped to give an extra spark to the art of flower arranging in Europe. It was during this time period that a wide variety of arrangement styles began to develop. By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, flower arrangements were commonplace and a wide variety of materials were used to make containers, including marble, heavy Venetian glass, and bronze.\n\nFlower arrangements made during this time introduced a whole new element – the usage of tropical fruits. These arrangements also focused on creating colour contrast. Some of the popular flowers included the Lilium Candidum (or Madonna Lily, used as a symbol for fertility and chastity), narcissus, pinks, iris, jasmine, pansies, French marigolds, cornflowers, and rosemary.\n\n\n"}

The mask covers the entire head and is typically part of a Halloween costume, or at other times to be funny, shocking, incongruous, or hip, or to disguise one's identity. It has also become an internet meme.\n\nThe horse mask was originally sold by novelty purveyor Archie McPhee as a Halloween costume since at least 2003. It is marketed under the name \"Horse Head Mask\" and is made of \"realistic brown latex with faux fur mane.\" McPhee claims \"a person wearing a Horse Head Mask looks downright disturbing\" and the mask \"has become a worldwide phenomenon\". Other manufacturers have since closely copied the look and design.\n\nIt is unclear when the mask transitioned from a novelty item to a meme, but there were a number of \"accelerants\" according to Caitlin Dewey of \"The Washington Post\". In 2003, the Japanese anime \"Full Metal Panic?\" introduced the character Pony-man, \"a horse-headed villain who pursued schoolgirls with a hairbrush\". Pony-man resembled someone wearing the McPhee horse mask and since the masks were already being sold \"pony-man kept cropping up\". In 2005, Lonely Planet recommended wearing a horse mask while traveling in its \"Guide to Experimental Travel\". Soon after, comedian/actor Tom Green wore a horse mask for an episode of his Internet talk show, \"Tom Green's House Tonight\". In January 2008, a performance artist named Wotaken filmed himself picking, cooking, and eating psychedelic mushrooms while completely naked, wearing a horse head mask and dancing to the \"Final Fantasy\" soundtrack \"Dancing Mad\". This film was uploaded to YouTube and reached over 2 million viewers and propelled the horse head to a wider audience. It has since been taken down for violating the site's terms of service.\n\nAfter Wotaken's naked psychedelic cooking video, the horse head mask became a more common Internet meme. Examples include a 2010 Scottish man known as \"horse boy\" captured by Google Street View; During Hurricane Sandy, in Washington, D. C., a man was filmed jogging through a live news shot shirtless but wearing a horse head mask. \n\nIn July 2014, President Barack Obama was photographed in the streets of Denver shaking the hand of a horse headed bystander resulting in national press exposure of the mask including a series of articles in \"The Washington Post\" about the meme's history and cultural influences.\n\nSome YouTube video contributors have chosen the horse head mask as their trademark, including Sir Sebastian of \"Sir Sebastian's Candy Corner,\" a candy and chocolate reviewer, as well as a Berlin street performer, \"The Neigh Kid Horse,\" who has been photographed by hundreds of amateur and professional photographers, and who is known for only wearing the mask and his underwear.\n\nDistinctly horselike unicorn head masks are also sold by Archie McPhee and others. Unicorn head masks have been used by Arizona State Sun Devils fans as part of program to distract opposing free throw shooters.\n"}

{"id": "162797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162797", "title": "Individuation", "text": "Individuation\n\nThe principle of individuation, or , describes the manner in which a thing is identified as distinguished from other things.\n\nThe concept appears in numerous fields and is encountered in works of Carl Gustav Jung, Gilbert Simondon, Alan Watts, Bernard Stiegler, Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer, David Bohm, Henri Bergson, Gilles Deleuze, and Manuel De Landa.\n\nThe word \"individuation\" occurs with different meanings and connotations in different fields.\n\nPhilosophically, \"individuation\" expresses the general idea of how a thing is identified as an individual thing that \"is not something else\". This includes how an individual person is held to be distinct from other elements in the world and how a person is distinct from other persons.\n\nIn Jungian psychology, also called analytical psychology, individuation is the process in which the individual self develops out of an undifferentiated unconscious – seen as a developmental psychic process during which innate elements of personality, the components of the immature psyche, and the experiences of the person's life become, if the process is more or less successful, integrated over time into a well-functioning whole.\nThe media industry has begun using the term \"individuation\" to denote new printing and online technologies that permit mass customization of the contents of a newspaper, a magazine, a broadcast program, or a website so that its contents match each individual user's unique interests. This differs from the traditional mass-media practice of producing the same contents for all readers, viewers, listeners, or online users.\n\nCommunications theorist Marshall McLuhan alluded to this trend when discussing the future of printed books in an electronically interconnected world.\n\nTwo quantum entangled particles cannot be understood independently. Two or more states in quantum superposition, e.g., as in Schrödinger's cat being simultaneously dead and alive, is mathematically not the same as assuming the cat is in an individual alive state with 50% probability. The Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says that complementary variables, such as position and momentum, cannot both be precisely known - in some sense, they are not individual variables. A \"natural criterion of individuality\" has been suggested.\n\nFor Schopenhauer the principium individuationis constituted of time and space, being the ground of multiplicity. In his view, the mere difference in location suffices to make two systems different, with each of the two states having its own real physical state, independent of the state of the other. \n\nThis view influenced Einstein. Schrödinger put the Schopenhaurian label on a folder of papers in his files “Collection of Thoughts on the physical Principium individuationis.”\n\nAccording to Jungian psychology, individuation () is a process of psychological integration. \"In general, it is the process by which individual beings are formed and differentiated [from other human beings]; in particular, it is the development of the psychological individual as a being distinct from the general, collective psychology.\"\n\nIndividuation is a process of transformation whereby the personal and collective unconscious are brought into consciousness (e.g., by means of dreams, active imagination, or free association) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche. Individuation has a holistic healing effect on the person, both mentally and physically.\n\nIn addition to Jung's theory of complexes, his theory of the individuation process forms conceptions of an unconscious filled with mythic images, a non-sexual libido, the general types of extraversion and introversion, the compensatory and prospective functions of dreams, and the synthetic and constructive approaches to fantasy formation and utilization.\n\n\"The symbols of the individuation process . . . mark its stages like milestones, prominent among them for Jungians being the shadow, the wise old man . . . and lastly the anima in man and the animus in woman.\" Thus, \"There is often a movement from dealing with the persona at the start . . . to the ego at the second stage, to the shadow as the third stage, to the anima or animus, to the Self as the final stage. Some would interpose the Wise Old Man and the Wise Old Woman as spiritual archetypes coming before the final step of the Self.\"\n\nIn \"L'individuation psychique et collective\", Gilbert Simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause. Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending ontological process of individuation.\n\nSimondon also conceived of \"pre-individual fields\" which make individuation possible. Individuation is an ever-incomplete process, always leaving a \"pre-individual\" left over, which makes possible future individuations. Furthermore, individuation always creates both an individual subject and a collective subject, which individuate themselves concurrently.\n\nThe philosophy of Bernard Stiegler draws upon and modifies the work of Gilbert Simondon on individuation and also upon similar ideas in Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. During a talk given at the Tate Modern art gallery in 2004, Stiegler summarized his understanding of individuation. The essential points are the following:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1429763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1429763", "title": "Iranian architecture", "text": "Iranian architecture\n\nIranian architecture or Persian architecture (Persian:مهرازى ایرانی) is the architecture of Iran and parts of the rest of West Asia, the Caucasus and Central Asia. Its history dates back to at least 5,000 BC with characteristic examples distributed over a vast area from Turkey and Iraq to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and from the Caucasus to Zanzibar. Persian buildings vary from peasant huts to tea houses and garden, pavilions to \"some of the most majestic structures the world has ever seen\". In addition to historic gates, palaces, and mosques, the rapid growth of cities such as the capital, Tehran (Architecture of Tehran) has brought about a wave of demolition and new construction.\n\nIranian architecture displays great variety, both structural and aesthetic, from a variety of traditions and experience. Without sudden innovations, and despite the repeated trauma of invasions and cultural shocks, it has achieved \"an individuality distinct from that of other Muslim countries\". Its paramount virtues are: \"a marked feeling for form and scale; structural inventiveness, especially in vault and dome construction; a genius for decoration with a freedom and success not rivaled in any other architecture\".\n\nTraditionally, the guiding formative motif of Iranian architecture has been its cosmic symbolism \"by which man is brought into communication and participation with the powers of heaven\". This theme has not only given unity and continuity to the architecture of Persia, but has been a primary source of its emotional character as well.\n\nAccording to Persian historian and archaeologist Arthur Pope, the supreme Iranian art, in the proper meaning of the word, has always been its architecture. The supremacy of architecture applies to both pre- and post-Islamic periods.\n\nTraditional Persian architecture has maintained a continuity that, although temporarily distracted by internal political conflicts or foreign invasion, nonetheless has achieved an unmistakable style.\n\nIn this architecture, \"there are no trivial buildings; even garden pavilions have nobility and dignity, and the humblest caravanserais generally have charm. In expressiveness and communicativity, most Persian buildings are lucid - even eloquent. The combination of intensity and simplicity of form provides immediacy, while ornament and, often, subtle proportions reward sustained observation.\"\n\nOverall, the traditional architecture of the Iranian lands throughout the ages can be categorized into the six following classes or styles \"(\"sabk\")\":\n\n\nAvailable building materials dictate major forms in traditional Iranian architecture. Heavy clays, readily available at various places throughout the plateau, have encouraged the development of the most primitive of all building techniques, molded mud, compressed as solidly as possible, and allowed to dry. This technique, used in Iran from ancient times, has never been completely abandoned. The abundance of heavy plastic earth, in conjunction with a tenacious lime mortar, also facilitated the development and use of brick.\n\nIranian architecture makes use of abundant symbolic geometry, using pure forms such as circles and squares, and plans are based on often symmetrical layouts featuring rectangular courtyards and halls.\n\nCertain design elements of Persian architecture have persisted throughout the history of Iran. The most striking are a marked feeling for scale and a discerning use of simple and massive forms. The consistency of decorative preferences, the high-arched portal set within a recess, columns with bracket capitals, and recurrent types of plan and elevation can also be mentioned. Through the ages these elements have recurred in completely different types of buildings, constructed for various programs and under the patronage of a long succession of rulers.\nThe columned porch, or \"talar\", seen in the rock-cut tombs near Persepolis, reappear in Sassanid temples, and in late Islamic times it was used as the portico of a palace or mosque, and adapted even to the architecture of roadside tea-houses. Similarly, the dome on four arches, so characteristic of Sassanid times, is a still to be found in many cemeteries and Imamzadehs across Iran today. The notion of earthly towers reaching up toward the sky to mingle with the divine towers of heaven lasted into the 19th century, while the interior court and pool, the angled entrance and extensive decoration are ancient, but still common, features of Iranian architecture.\n\nThe pre-Islamic styles draw on 3000 to 4000 years of architectural development from various civilizations of the Iranian plateau. The post-Islamic architecture of Iran in turn, draws ideas from its pre-Islamic predecessor, and has geometrical and repetitive forms, as well as surfaces that are richly decorated with glazed tiles, carved stucco, patterned brickwork, floral motifs, and calligraphy.\n\nIran is recognized by UNESCO as being one of the cradles of civilization.\n\nEach of the periods of Elamites, Achaemenids, Parthians and Sassanids were creators of great architecture that, over the ages, spread far and wide far to other cultures. Although Iran has suffered its share of destruction, including Alexander The Great's decision to burn Persepolis, there are sufficient remains to form a picture of its classical architecture.\n\nThe Achaemenids built on a grand scale. The artists and materials they used were brought in from practically all territories of what was then the largest state in the world. Pasargadae set the standard: its city was laid out in an extensive park with bridges, gardens, colonnaded palaces and open column pavilions. Pasargadae along with Susa and Persepolis expressed the authority of \"The King of Kings\", the staircases of the latter recording in relief sculpture the vast extent of the imperial frontier.\n\nWith the emergence of the Parthians and Sassanids new forms appeared. Parthian innovations fully flowered during the Sassanid period with massive barrel-vaulted chambers, solid masonry domes and tall columns. This influence was to remain for years to come.\n\nFor example, the roundness of the city of Baghdad in the Abbasid era, points to its Persian precedents, such as Firouzabad in Fars. Al-Mansur hired two designers to plan the city's design: Naubakht, a former Persian Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city should be astrologically significant, and Mashallah ibn Athari, a former Jew from Khorasan.\n\nThe ruins of Persepolis, Ctesiphon, Sialk, Pasargadae, Firouzabad, and Arg-é Bam give us a distant glimpse of what contributions Persians made to the art of building. The imposing Sassanid castle built at Derbent, Dagestan (now a part of Russia) is one of the most extant and living examples of splendid Sassanid Iranian architecture. Since 2003, the Sassanid castle has been listed on Russia's UNESCO World Heritage list.\n\nThe fall of the Sassanian dynasty to the invading Muslim Arabs led to the adaptation of Persian architectural forms for Islamic religious buildings in Iran. Arts such as calligraphy, stucco work, mirror work and mosaics became closely tied with the architecture of mosques in Persia \"(Iran)\". An example is the round-domed rooftops which originate in the Parthian \"(Ashkanid)\" dynasty of Iran.\n\nArchaeological excavations have provided extensive evidence supporting the impact of Sassanid architecture on the architecture of the Islamic world at large. \n\nMany experts believe the period of Persian architecture from the 15th through 17th centuries CE to be the pinnacle of the post-Islamic era. Various structures such as mosques, mausoleums, bazaars, bridges and palaces have survived from this period.\n\nSafavid Isfahan tried to achieve grandeur in scale (Isfahan's Naghsh-i Jahan Square is the sixth largest square worldwide), by constructing tall buildings with vast inner spaces. However, the quality of ornaments was less compared to those of the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\nAnother aspect of this architecture was the harmony with the people, their environment, and the beliefs that it represented. At the same time no strict rules were applied to govern this form of Islamic architecture.\n\nThe great mosques of Khorasan, Isfahan and Tabriz each used local geometry, local materials and local building methods to express, each in their own way, the order, harmony, and unity of Islamic architecture. When the major monuments of Islamic Persian architecture are examined, they reveal complex geometrical relationships, a studied hierarchy of form and ornament and great depths of symbolic meaning.\n\nIn the words of Arthur U. Pope, who carried out extensive studies in ancient Persian and Islamic buildings:\n\nHowever, Pope's approach toward Qajar art and architecture is quite negative.\n\nThe Sassanid Empire initiated the construction of the first large-scale domes in Persia (Iran), with such royal buildings as the Palace of Ardashir and Dezh Dokhtar. After the Muslim conquest of the Sassanid Empire, the Persian architectural style became a major influence on Islamic societies and the dome also became a feature of Muslim architecture (see \"gonbad\").\n\nThe Il-Khanate period provided several innovations to dome-building that eventually enabled the Persians to construct much taller structures. These changes later paved the way for Safavid architecture. The pinnacle of Il-Khanate architecture was reached with the construction of the Soltaniyeh Dome (1302–1312) in Zanjan, Iran, which measures 50 m in height and 25 m in diameter, making it the 3rd largest and the tallest masonry dome ever erected. The thin, double-shelled dome was reinforced by arches between the layers.\n\nThe renaissance in Persian mosque and dome building came during the Safavid dynasty, when Shah Abbas, in 1598, initiated the reconstruction of Isfahan, with the Naqsh-e Jahan Square as the centerpiece of his new capital. Architecturally they borrowed heavily from Il-Khanate designs, but artistically they elevated the designs to a new level. \n\nThe distinct feature of Persian domes, which separates them from those domes created in the Christian world or the Ottoman and Mughal empires, was the use of colourful tiles, with which the exterior of domes are covered much like the interior. These domes soon numbered dozens in Isfahan and the distinct blue shape would dominate the skyline of the city. Reflecting the light of the sun, these domes appeared like glittering turquoise gems and could be seen from miles away by travelers following the Silk road through Persia.\n\nThis very distinct style of architecture was inherited from the Seljuq dynasty, who for centuries had used it in their mosque building, but it was perfected during the Safavids when they invented the \"haft- rangi\", or seven colour style of tile burning, a process that enabled them to apply more colours to each tile, creating richer patterns, sweeter to the eye. The colours that the Persians favoured were gold, white and turquoise patterns on a dark-blue background. The extensive inscription bands of calligraphy and arabesque on most of the major buildings where carefully planned and executed by Ali Reza Abbasi, who was appointed head of the royal library and Master calligrapher at the Shah's court in 1598, while Shaykh Bahai oversaw the construction projects. Reaching 53 meters in height, the dome of Masjed-e Shah (Shah Mosque) would become the tallest in the city when it was finished in 1629. It was built as a double-shelled dome, spanning 14 m between the two layers and resting on an octagonal dome chamber.\n\nContemporary architecture in Iran begins with the advent of the first Pahlavi period in the early 1920s. Some designers, such as Andre Godard, created works such as the National Museum of Iran that were reminiscent of Iran's historical architectural heritage. Others made an effort to merge the traditional elements with modern designs in their works. The Tehran University main campus is one such example. Others, such as Heydar Ghiai and Houshang Seyhoun, have tried to create completely original works, independent of prior influences.Dariush Borbor's architecture successfully combined modern architecture with local vernacular. Borj-e Milad (or Milad Tower) is the tallest tower in Iran and is the fourth tallest tower in the world.\n\nMajor construction projects are underway all around Iran. Iran is developing Isfahan City Center, which is the largest mall in Iran and the largest mall with a museum in the world. It includes a hotel, indoor amusement park, and food court, among other amenities. The Flower of the East Development Project is another grand project on Kish Island in the Persian Gulf. The project, includes one '7-star' and two '5-star' hotels, three residential areas, villas and apartment complexes, coffee shops, luxury showrooms and stores, sports facilities and a marina.\n\nPersian architects were highly sought in the old days, before the advent of Modern Architecture. For example, Badreddin Tabrizi built the tomb of Rumi in Konya in 1273 AD, while Ostad Isa Shirazi is most often credited as the chief architect (or plan drawer) of the Taj Mahal. These artisans were also highly instrumental in the designs of such edifices as Baku, Afghanistan's Minaret of Jam, The Sultaniyeh Dome, or Tamerlane's tomb in Samarkand, among many others.\n\nThe following is a list of World Heritage Sites designed or constructed by Iranians, or designed and constructed in the style of Iranian architecture:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His work is one of the cornerstones of the study of media theory. Born in Edmonton, Alberta, McLuhan studied at the University of Manitoba and the University of Cambridge. He began his teaching career as a professor of English at several universities in the U.S. and Canada before moving to the University of Toronto in 1946, where he remained for the rest of his life.\n\nMcLuhan is known for coining the expression \"the medium is the message\" and the term global village, and for predicting the World Wide Web almost 30 years before it was invented. He was a fixture in media discourse in the late 1960s, though his influence began to wane in the early 1970s. In the years after his death, he continued to be a controversial figure in academic circles. With the arrival of the Internet and the World Wide Web interest was renewed in his work and perspective.\n\nHerbert Marshall McLuhan was born on July 21, 1911, in Edmonton, Alberta, to Elsie Naomi (née Hall) and Herbert Ernest McLuhan, both born in Canada. His brother Maurice was born two years later. \"Marshall\" was his maternal grandmother's surname. His mother was a Baptist school teacher who later became an actress; his father was a Methodist and had a real estate business in Edmonton. That business failed when World War I broke out, and McLuhan's father enlisted in the Canadian army. After a year of service, he contracted influenza and remained in Canada, away from the front lines. After his discharge from the army in 1915, the McLuhan family moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, where Marshall grew up and went to school, attending Kelvin Technical School before enrolling in the University of Manitoba in 1928.\n\nAt Manitoba, McLuhan explored his conflicted relationship with religion and turned to literature to \"gratify his soul's hunger for truth and beauty,\" later referring to this stage as agnosticism. After studying for one year as an engineering student, he changed majors and earned a BA (1933), winning a University Gold Medal in Arts and Sciences. He took an MA (1934) in English from the University of Manitoba in 1934. He had long desired to pursue graduate studies in England and was accepted to the University of Cambridge, having failed to secure a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford.\n\nHe had already earned a BA and an MA degree at Manitoba, but Cambridge required him to enroll as an undergraduate \"affiliated\" student, with one year's credit towards a three-year bachelor's degree, before entering any doctoral studies. He entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge in the autumn of 1934, where he studied under I. A. Richards and F. R. Leavis and was influenced by New Criticism. Upon reflection years afterward, he credited the faculty there with influencing the direction of his later work because of their emphasis on the \"training of perception\" and such concepts as Richards' notion of \"feedforward\". These studies formed an important precursor to his later ideas on technological forms. He received the required bachelor's degree from Cambridge in 1936 and entered their graduate program. Later, he returned from England to take a job as a teaching assistant at the University of Wisconsin–Madison that he held for the 1936–37 academic year, being unable to find a suitable job in Canada.\n\nWhile studying the trivium at Cambridge, he took the first steps toward his eventual conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1937, founded on his reading of G. K. Chesterton. In 1935, he wrote to his mother: \"[H]ad I not encountered Chesterton, I would have remained agnostic for many years at least.\" At the end of March 1937, McLuhan completed what was a slow but total conversion process, when he was formally received into the Roman Catholic Church. After consulting a minister, his father accepted the decision to convert. His mother, however, felt that his conversion would hurt his career and was inconsolable. McLuhan was devout throughout his life, but his religion remained a private matter. He had a lifelong interest in the number three (e.g., the trivium, the Trinity) and sometimes said that the Virgin Mary provided intellectual guidance for him. For the rest of his career, he taught in Roman Catholic institutions of higher education. From 1937 to 1944, he taught English at Saint Louis University (with an interruption from 1939–40 when he returned to Cambridge). There he taught courses on Shakespeare and tutored and befriended Walter J. Ong, who went on to write his PhD dissertation on a topic that McLuhan had called to his attention, and who also became a well-known authority on communication and technology.\n\nMcLuhan met Corinne Lewis in St. Louis, a teacher and aspiring actress from Fort Worth, Texas, and they were married on August 4, 1939. They spent 1939–40 in Cambridge, where he completed his master's degree (awarded in January 1940) and began to work on his doctoral dissertation on Thomas Nashe and the verbal arts. While the McLuhans were in England, war had broken out in Europe. For this reason, he obtained permission to complete and submit his dissertation from the United States, without having to return to Cambridge for an oral defence. In 1940, the McLuhans returned to Saint Louis University, where he continued teaching and they started a family. He was awarded a Ph.D. in December 1943. He next taught at Assumption College in Windsor, Ontario from 1944 to 1946, then moved to Toronto in 1946 where he joined the faculty of St. Michael's College, a Catholic college of the University of Toronto. Hugh Kenner was one of his students and Canadian economist and communications scholar Harold Innis was a university colleague who had a strong influence on his work. McLuhan wrote in 1964: \"I am pleased to think of my own book \"The Gutenberg Galaxy\" as a footnote to the observations of Innis on the subject of the psychic and social consequences, first of writing then of printing.\"\n\nIn the early 1950s, McLuhan began the Communication and Culture seminars at the University of Toronto, funded by the Ford Foundation. As his reputation grew, he received a growing number of offers from other universities and, to keep him, the university created the Centre for Culture and Technology in 1963. He published his first major work during this period: \"\" (1951). The work was an examination of the effect of advertising on society and culture. He and Edmund Carpenter also produced an important journal called \"Explorations\" throughout the 1950s. McLuhan and Carpenter have been characterized as the Toronto School of communication theory, together with Harold Innis, Eric A. Havelock, and Northrop Frye. During this time, McLuhan supervised the doctoral thesis of modernist writer Sheila Watson on the subject of Wyndham Lewis. He remained at the University of Toronto through 1979, spending much of this time as head of his Centre for Culture and Technology.\n\nMcLuhan was named to the Albert Schweitzer Chair in Humanities at Fordham University in the Bronx for one year (1967–68). While at Fordham, he was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour, and it was treated successfully. He returned to Toronto where he taught at the University of Toronto for the rest of his life and lived in Wychwood Park, a bucolic enclave on a hill overlooking the downtown where Anatol Rapoport was his neighbour. In 1970, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. In 1975, the University of Dallas hosted him from April to May, appointing him to the McDermott Chair.\n\nMarshall and Corinne McLuhan had six children: Eric, twins Mary and Teresa, Stephanie, Elizabeth, and Michael. The associated costs of a large family eventually drove him to advertising work and accepting frequent consulting and speaking engagements for large corporations, IBM and AT&T among them. Woody Allen's Oscar-winning motion picture \"Annie Hall\" (1977) featured McLuhan in a cameo as himself; a pompous academic arguing with Allen in a cinema queue is silenced by McLuhan suddenly appearing and saying, \"You know nothing of my work.\" This was one of McLuhan's most frequent statements to and about those who disagreed with him.\n\nIn September 1979, he suffered a stroke which affected his ability to speak. The University of Toronto's School of Graduate Studies tried to close his research centre shortly thereafter, but was deterred by substantial protests, most notably by Woody Allen. He never fully recovered from the stroke and died in his sleep on December 31, 1980.\n\nDuring his years at Saint Louis University (1937–1944), McLuhan worked concurrently on two projects: his doctoral dissertation and the manuscript that was eventually published in 1951 as the book \"The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man\", which included only a representative selection of the materials that McLuhan had prepared for it.\n\nMcLuhan's 1942 Cambridge University doctoral dissertation surveys the history of the verbal arts (grammar, logic, and rhetoric—collectively known as the trivium) from the time of Cicero down to the time of Thomas Nashe. In his later publications, McLuhan at times uses the Latin concept of the \"trivium\" to outline an orderly and systematic picture of certain periods in the history of Western culture. McLuhan suggests that the Late Middle Ages, for instance, were characterized by the heavy emphasis on the formal study of logic. The key development that led to the Renaissance was not the rediscovery of ancient texts but a shift in emphasis from the formal study of logic to rhetoric and grammar. Modern life is characterized by the re-emergence of grammar as its most salient feature—a trend McLuhan felt was exemplified by the New Criticism of Richards and Leavis.\n\nIn \"The Mechanical Bride\", McLuhan turned his attention to analysing and commenting on numerous examples of persuasion in contemporary popular culture. This followed naturally from his earlier work as both dialectic and rhetoric in the classical trivium aimed at persuasion. At this point his focus shifted dramatically, turning inward to study the influence of communication media independent of their content. His famous aphorism \"the medium is the message\" (elaborated in his 1964 book, \"\") calls attention to this intrinsic effect of communications media.\n\nMcLuhan also started the journal \"Explorations\" with anthropologist Edmund \"Ted\" Carpenter. In a letter to Walter Ong dated May 31, 1953, McLuhan reported that he had received a two-year grant of $43,000 from the Ford Foundation to carry out a communication project at the University of Toronto involving faculty from different disciplines, which led to the creation of the journal.\n\nAt a Fordham lecture in 1999, Tom Wolfe suggested that a major under-acknowledged influence on McLuhan's work is the Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin whose ideas anticipated those of McLuhan, especially the evolution of the human mind into the \"noosphere\". In fact, McLuhan warns against outright dismissing or whole-heartedly accepting de Chardin's observations early on in his second published book \"The Gutenberg Galaxy\" (p. 32): \"This externalization of our senses creates what de Chardin calls the 'noosphere' or a technological brain for the world. Instead of tending towards a vast Alexandrian library the world has become a computer, an electronic brain, exactly as in an infantile piece of science fiction. And as our senses have gone outside us, Big Brother goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and super-imposed co-existence.\"\n\nIn his private life, McLuhan wrote to friends saying: \"I am not a fan of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The idea that anything is better because it comes later is surely borrowed from pre-electronic technologies.\" Further, McLuhan noted to a Catholic collaborator: \"The idea of a Cosmic thrust in one direction ... is surely one of the lamest semantic fallacies ever bred by the word ‘evolution’ ... That development should have any direction at all is inconceivable except to the highly literate community.\"\n\nMcLuhan's first book, \"\" (1951), is a pioneering study in the field now known as popular culture. His interest in the critical study of popular culture was influenced by the 1933 book \"Culture and Environment\" by F. R. Leavis and Denys Thompson, and the title \"The Mechanical Bride\" is derived from a piece by the Dadaist artist, Marcel Duchamp.\n\nLike his 1962 book \"The Gutenberg Galaxy\", \"The Mechanical Bride\" is composed of a number of short essays that can be read in any order—what he styled the \"mosaic approach\" to writing a book. Each essay begins with a newspaper or magazine article or an advertisement, followed by McLuhan's analysis thereof. The analyses bear on aesthetic considerations as well as on the implications behind the imagery and text. McLuhan chose the ads and articles included in his book not only to draw attention to their symbolism and their implications for the corporate entities that created and disseminated them, but also to mull over what such advertising implies about the wider society at which it is aimed.\n\nMcLuhan's \"The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man\" (written in 1961, first published in Canada by University of Toronto Press in 1962) is a pioneering study in the fields of oral culture, print culture, cultural studies, and media ecology.\n\nThroughout the book, McLuhan takes pains to reveal how communication technology (alphabetic writing, the printing press, and the electronic media) affects cognitive organization, which in turn has profound ramifications for social organization:\n...[I]f a new technology extends one or more of our senses outside us into the social world, then new ratios among all of our senses will occur in that particular culture. It is comparable to what happens when a new note is added to a melody. And when the sense ratios alter in any culture then what had appeared lucid before may suddenly become opaque, and what had been vague or opaque will become translucent.\n\nHis episodic history takes the reader from pre-alphabetic tribal humankind to the electronic age. According to McLuhan, the invention of movable type greatly accelerated, intensified, and ultimately enabled cultural and cognitive changes that had already been taking place since the invention and implementation of the alphabet, by which McLuhan means phonemic orthography. (McLuhan is careful to distinguish the phonetic alphabet from logographic/logogramic writing systems, like Egyptian hieroglyphs or ideograms.)\n\nPrint culture, ushered in by the Gutenberg press in the middle of the fifteenth century, brought about the cultural predominance of the visual over the aural/oral. Quoting with approval an observation on the nature of the printed word from \"Prints and Visual Communication\" by William Ivins, McLuhan remarks:\nIn this passage [Ivins] not only notes the ingraining of lineal, sequential habits, but, even more important, points out the visual homogenizing of experience of print culture, and the relegation of auditory and other sensuous complexity to the background. [...] The technology and social effects of typography incline us to abstain from noting interplay and, as it were, \"formal\" causality, both in our inner and external lives. Print exists by virtue of the static separation of functions and fosters a mentality that gradually resists any but a separative and compartmentalizing or specialist outlook.\n\nThe main concept of McLuhan's argument (later elaborated upon in \"The Medium Is the Massage\") is that new technologies (like alphabets, printing presses, and even speech itself) exert a gravitational effect on cognition, which in turn affects social organization: print technology changes our perceptual habits (\"visual homogenizing of experience\"), which in turn affects social interactions (\"fosters a mentality that gradually resists all but a... specialist outlook\"). According to McLuhan, the advent of print technology contributed to and made possible most of the salient trends in the Modern period in the Western world: individualism, democracy, Protestantism, capitalism and nationalism. For McLuhan, these trends all reverberate with print technology's principle of \"segmentation of actions and functions and principle of visual quantification.\"\n\nIn the early 1960s, McLuhan wrote that the visual, individualistic print culture would soon be brought to an end by what he called \"electronic interdependence\": when electronic media replaces visual culture with aural/oral culture. In this new age, humankind will move from individualism and fragmentation to a collective identity, with a \"tribal base.\" McLuhan's coinage for this new social organization is the \"global village\".\n\nThe term is sometimes described as having negative connotations in \"The Gutenberg Galaxy\", but McLuhan himself was interested in exploring effects, not making value judgments:\nInstead of tending towards a vast Alexandrian library the world has become a computer, an electronic brain, exactly as an infantile piece of science fiction. And as our senses have gone outside us, Big Brother goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and superimposed co-existence. [...] Terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything affects everything all the time. [...] In our long striving to recover for the Western world a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture.\n\nKey to McLuhan's argument is the idea that technology has no \"per se\" moral bent—it is a tool that profoundly shapes an individual's and, by extension, a society's self-conception and realization:\n\nIs it not obvious that there are always enough moral problems without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than manuscript culture could ever do. Print is the technology of individualism. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. \"But\", someone says, \"we didn't know it would happen.\" Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; and it would be nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for morality.\n\nThe moral valence of technology's effects on cognition is, for McLuhan, a matter of perspective. For instance, McLuhan contrasts the considerable alarm and revulsion that the growing quantity of books aroused in the latter seventeenth century with the modern concern for the \"end of the book\". If there can be no universal moral sentence passed on technology, McLuhan believes that \"there can only be disaster arising from unawareness of the causalities and effects inherent in our technologies\".\n\nThough the World Wide Web was invented almost thirty years after \"The Gutenberg Galaxy\", and ten years after his death, McLuhan prophesied the web technology seen today as early as 1962:\n\nThe next medium, whatever it is—it may be the extension of consciousness—will include television as its content, not as its environment, and will transform television into an art form. A computer as a research and communication instrument could enhance retrieval, obsolesce mass library organization, retrieve the individual's encyclopedic function and flip into a private line to speedily tailored data of a saleable kind.\n\nFurthermore, McLuhan coined and certainly popularized the usage of the term \"surfing\" to refer to rapid, irregular and multidirectional movement through a heterogeneous body of documents or knowledge, e.g., statements like \"Heidegger surf-boards along on the electronic wave as triumphantly as Descartes rode the mechanical wave.\" Paul Levinson's 1999 book \"Digital McLuhan\" explores the ways that McLuhan's work can be better understood through the lens of the digital revolution.\n\nMcLuhan frequently quoted Walter Ong's \"Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue\" (1958), which evidently had prompted McLuhan to write \"The Gutenberg Galaxy\". Ong wrote a highly favorable review of this new book in \"America\". However, Ong later tempered his praise, by describing McLuhan's \"The Gutenberg Galaxy\" as \"a racy survey, indifferent to some scholarly detail, but uniquely valuable in suggesting the sweep and depth of the cultural and psychological changes entailed in the passage from illiteracy to print and beyond.\" McLuhan himself said of the book, \"I'm not concerned to get any kudos out of [\"The Gutenberg Galaxy\"]. It seems to me a book that somebody should have written a century ago. I wish somebody else had written it. It will be a useful prelude to the rewrite of \"Understanding Media\" [the 1960 NAEB report] that I'm doing now.\" \n\nMcLuhan's \"The Gutenberg Galaxy\" won Canada's highest literary award, the Governor-General's Award for Non-Fiction, in 1962. The chairman of the selection committee was McLuhan's colleague at the University of Toronto and oftentime intellectual sparring partner, Northrop Frye.\n\nMcLuhan's most widely known work, \"Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man\" (1964), is a pioneering study in media theory. Dismayed by the way people approached and used new media such as television, McLuhan famously argued that in the modern world \"we live mythically and integrally ... but continue to think in the old, fragmented space and time patterns of the pre-electric age.\"\n\nMcLuhan proposed that media themselves, not the content they carry, should be the focus of study—popularly quoted as \"the medium is the message\". McLuhan's insight was that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not by the content delivered over the medium, but by the characteristics of the medium itself. McLuhan pointed to the light bulb as a clear demonstration of this concept. A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that \"a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence.\" More controversially, he postulated that content had little effect on society—in other words, it did not matter if television broadcasts children's shows or violent programming, to illustrate one example—the effect of television on society would be identical. He noted that all media have characteristics that engage the viewer in different ways; for instance, a passage in a book could be reread at will, but a movie had to be screened again in its entirety to study any individual part of it.\n\nIn the first part of \"Understanding Media,\" McLuhan also stated that different media invite different degrees of participation on the part of a person who chooses to consume a medium. Some media, like the movies, were \"hot\"—that is, they enhance one single sense, in this case vision, in such a manner that a person does not need to exert much effort in filling in the details of a movie image. McLuhan contrasted this with \"cool\" TV, which he claimed requires more effort on the part of the viewer to determine meaning, and comics, which due to their minimal presentation of visual detail require a high degree of effort to fill in details that the cartoonist may have intended to portray. A movie is thus said by McLuhan to be \"hot\", intensifying one single sense \"high definition\", demanding a viewer's attention, and a comic book to be \"cool\" and \"low definition\", requiring much more conscious participation by the reader to extract value.\n\n\"Any hot medium allows of less participation than a cool one, as a lecture makes for less participation than a seminar, and a book for less than a dialogue.\"\n\nHot media usually, but not always, provide complete involvement without considerable stimulus. For example, print occupies visual space, uses visual senses, but can immerse its reader. Hot media favour analytical precision, quantitative analysis and sequential ordering, as they are usually sequential, linear and logical. They emphasize one sense (for example, of sight or sound) over the others. For this reason, hot media also include radio, as well as film, the lecture, and photography.\n\nCool media, on the other hand, are usually, but not always, those that provide little involvement with substantial stimulus. They require more active participation on the part of the user, including the perception of abstract patterning and simultaneous comprehension of all parts. Therefore, according to McLuhan cool media include television, as well as the seminar and cartoons. McLuhan describes the term \"cool media\" as emerging from jazz and popular music and, in this context, is used to mean \"detached.\" Cool medium incorporates increased involvement but decreased description while hot medium is the opposite, decreased involvement and increased description. In other words, a society that appears to be actively participating in the streaming of content but not considering the effects of the tool is not allowing an \"extension of ourselves.\" \n\nThis concept appears to force media into binary categories. However, McLuhan's hot and cool exist on a continuum: they are more correctly measured on a scale than as dichotomous terms.\n\nSome theorists have attacked McLuhan’s definition and treatment of the word \"medium\" for being too simplistic. Umberto Eco, for instance, contends that McLuhan’s medium conflates channels, codes, and messages under the overarching term of the medium, confusing the vehicle, internal code, and content of a given message in his framework.\n\nIn \"Media Manifestos\", Régis Debray also takes issue with McLuhan’s envisioning of the medium. Like Eco, he too is ill at ease with this reductionist approach, summarizing its ramifications as follows:\n\nFurthermore, when \"Wired\" interviewed him in 1995, Debray stated that he views McLuhan \"more as a poet than a historian, a master of intellectual collage rather than a systematic analyst ... McLuhan overemphasizes the technology behind cultural change at the expense of the usage that the messages and codes make of that technology.\"\n\nDwight Macdonald, in turn, reproached McLuhan for his focus on television and for his \"aphoristic\" style of prose, which he believes left \"Understanding Media\" filled with \"contradictions, non-sequiturs, facts that are distorted and facts that are not facts, exaggerations, and chronic rhetorical vagueness.\" \n\nAdditionally, Brian Winston’s \"Misunderstanding Media\", published in 1986, chides McLuhan for what he sees as his technologically deterministic stances. Raymond Williams and James W. Carey further this point of contention, claiming:\n\nThe work of McLuhan was a particular culmination of an aesthetic theory which became, negatively, a social theory [...] It is an apparently sophisticated technological determinism which has the significant effect of indicating a social and cultural determinism [...] If the medium – whether print or television – is the cause, of all other causes, all that men ordinarily see as history is at once reduced to effects. (Williams 1990, 126/7)\n\nDavid Carr states that there has been a long line of \"academics who have made a career out of deconstructing McLuhan’s effort to define the modern media ecosystem,\" whether it be due to what they see as McLuhan’s ignorance toward sociohistorical context or the style of his argument.\n\nWhile some critics have taken issue with McLuhan’s writing style and mode of argument, McLuhan himself urged readers to think of his work as \"probes\" or \"mosaics\" offering a toolkit approach to thinking about the media. His eclectic writing style has also been praised for its postmodern sensibilities and suitability for virtual space.\n\n\"The Medium Is the Massage\", published in 1967, was McLuhan's best seller, \"eventually selling nearly a million copies worldwide.\" Initiated by Quentin Fiore, McLuhan adopted the term \"massage\" to denote the effect each medium has on the human sensorium, taking inventory of the \"effects\" of numerous media in terms of how they \"massage\" the sensorium.\n\nFiore, at the time a prominent graphic designer and communications consultant, set about composing the visual illustration of these effects which were compiled by Jerome Agel. Near the beginning of the book, Fiore adopted a pattern in which an image demonstrating a media effect was presented with a textual synopsis on the facing page. The reader experiences a repeated shifting of analytic registers—from \"reading\" typographic print to \"scanning\" photographic facsimiles—reinforcing McLuhan's overarching argument in this book: namely, that each medium produces a different \"massage\" or \"effect\" on the human sensorium.\n\nIn \"The Medium Is the Massage\", McLuhan also rehashed the argument—which first appeared in the Prologue to 1962's \"The Gutenberg Galaxy\"—that all media are \"extensions\" of our human senses, bodies and minds.\n\nFinally, McLuhan described key points of change in how man has viewed the world and how these views were changed by the adoption of new media. \"The technique of invention was the discovery of the nineteenth [century]\", brought on by the adoption of fixed points of view and perspective by typography, while \"[t]he technique of the suspended judgment is the discovery of the twentieth century\", brought on by the bard abilities of radio, movies and television.\n\nAn audio recording version of McLuhan's famous work was made by Columbia Records. The recording consists of a pastiche of statements made by McLuhan \"interrupted\" by other speakers, including people speaking in various phonations and falsettos, discordant sounds and 1960s incidental music in what could be considered a deliberate attempt to translate the disconnected images seen on TV into an audio format, resulting in the prevention of a connected stream of conscious thought. Various audio recording techniques and statements are used to illustrate the relationship between spoken, literary speech and the characteristics of electronic audio media. McLuhan biographer Philip Marchand called the recording \"the 1967 equivalent of a McLuhan video.\"\n\nMcLuhan used James Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\", an inspiration for this study of war throughout history, as an indicator as to how war may be conducted in the future.\n\nJoyce's \"Wake\" is claimed to be a gigantic cryptogram which reveals a cyclic pattern for the whole history of man through its Ten Thunders. Each \"thunder\" below is a 100-character portmanteau of other words to create a statement he likens to an effect that each technology has on the society into which it is introduced. In order to glean the most understanding out of each, the reader must break the portmanteau into separate words (and many of these are themselves portmanteaus of words taken from multiple languages other than English) and speak them aloud for the spoken effect of each word. There is much dispute over what each portmanteau truly denotes.\n\nMcLuhan claims that the ten thunders in \"Wake\" represent different stages in the history of man:\n\nIn his 1970 book, \"From Cliché to Archetype\", McLuhan, collaborating with Canadian poet Wilfred Watson, approached the various implications of the verbal cliché and of the archetype. One major facet in McLuhan's overall framework introduced in this book that is seldom noticed is the provision of a new term that actually succeeds the global village; the \"global theater\".\n\nIn McLuhan's terms, a cliché is a \"normal\" action, phrase, etc. which becomes so often used that we are \"anesthetized\" to its effects.\n\nAn example of this given by McLuhan is Eugène Ionesco's play \"The Bald Soprano\", whose dialogue consists entirely of phrases Ionesco pulled from an Assimil language book. \"Ionesco originally put all these idiomatic English clichés into literary French which presented the English in the most absurd aspect possible.\"\n\nMcLuhan's \"archetype\" \"is a quoted extension, medium, technology or environment.\" \"Environment\" would also include the kinds of \"awareness\" and cognitive shifts brought upon people by it, not totally unlike the psychological context Carl Jung described.\n\nMcLuhan also posits that there is a factor of interplay between the cliché and the archetype, or a \"doubleness\":\n\nAnother theme of the Wake [\"Finnegans Wake\"] that helps in the understanding of the paradoxical shift from cliché to archetype is 'past time are pastimes.' The dominant technologies of one age become the games and pastimes of a later age. In the 20th century, the number of 'past times' that are simultaneously available is so vast as to create cultural anarchy. When all the cultures of the world are simultaneously present, the work of the artist in the elucidation of form takes on new scope and new urgency. Most men are pushed into the artist's role. The artist cannot dispense with the principle of 'doubleness' or 'interplay' because this type of hendiadys dialogue is essential to the very structure of consciousness, awareness, and autonomy.\n\nMcLuhan relates the cliché-to-archetype process to the Theater of the Absurd:\nPascal, in the seventeenth century, tells us that the heart has many reasons of which the head knows nothing. The Theater of the Absurd is essentially a communicating to the head of some of the silent languages of the heart which in two or three hundred years it has tried to forget all about. In the seventeenth century world the languages of the heart were pushed down into the unconscious by the dominant print cliché.\n\nThe \"languages of the heart\", or what McLuhan would otherwise define as oral culture, were thus made archetype by means of the printing press, and turned into cliché.\n\nThe satellite medium, McLuhan states, encloses the Earth in a man-made environment, which \"ends 'Nature' and turns the globe into a repertory theater to be programmed.\" All previous environments (book, newspaper, radio, etc.) and their artifacts are retrieved under these conditions (\"past times are pastimes\"). McLuhan thereby meshes this into the term \"global theater\". It serves as an update to his older concept of the global village, which, in its own definitions, can be said to be subsumed into the overall condition described by that of the global theater.\n\nIn his 1989 posthumous book, \"The Global Village\", McLuhan, collaborating with Bruce R. Powers, provided a strong conceptual framework for understanding the cultural implications of the technological advances associated with the rise of a worldwide electronic network. This is a major work of McLuhan's because it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of Acoustic Space, and it provides a critique of standard 20th century communication models like the Shannon–Weaver model. McLuhan distinguishes between the existing worldview of Visual Space – a linear, quantitative, classically geometric model – and that of Acoustic Space – a holistic, qualitative order with a complex intricate paradoxical topology. \"Acoustic Space has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or center is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere.\" The transition from Visual to Acoustic Space was not automatic with the advent of the global network, but would have to be a conscious project. The \"universal environment of simultaneous electronic flow\" inherently favors right-brain Acoustic Space, yet we are held back by habits of adhering to a fixed point of view. There are no boundaries to sound. We hear from all directions at once. Yet Acoustic and Visual Space are in fact inseparable. The resonant interval is the invisible borderline between Visual and Acoustic Space. This is like the television camera that the Apollo 8 astronauts focused on the Earth after they had orbited the moon.\n\nReading, writing, and hierarchical ordering are associated with the left brain, as are the linear concept of time and phonetic literacy. The left brain is the locus of analysis, classification, and rationality. The right brain is the locus of the spatial, tactile, and musical. \"Comprehensive awareness\" results when the two sides of the brain are in true balance. Visual Space is associated with the simplified worldview of Euclidean geometry, the intuitive three dimensions useful for the architecture of buildings and the surveying of land. It is too rational and has no grasp of the acoustic. Acoustic Space is multisensory.\n\nMcLuhan writes about robotism in the context of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new ways of thinking about technology. The Western way of thinking about technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of our brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of \"Blade Runner\" and the novels of Philip K. Dick. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, \"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword\", an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: \"Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours.\" The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.\n\n\"All Western scientific models of communication are—like the Shannon–Weaver model—linear, sequential, and logical as a reflection of the late medieval emphasis on the Greek notion of efficient causality.\" McLuhan and Powers criticize the Shannon-Weaver model of communication as emblematic of left-hemisphere bias and linearity, descended from a print-era perversion of Aristotle's notion of efficient causality.\n\nA third term of \"The Global Village\" that McLuhan and Powers develop at length is The Tetrad. McLuhan had begun development on the Tetrad as early as 1974. The tetrad an analogical, simultaneous four-fold pattern of transformation. \"At full maturity the tetrad reveals the metaphoric structure of the artifact as having two figures and two grounds in dynamic and analogical relationship to each other.\" Like the camera focused on the Earth by the Apollo 8 astronauts, the tetrad reveals figure (Moon) and ground (Earth) simultaneously. The right-brain hemisphere thinking is the capability of being in many places at the same time. Electricity is acoustic. It is simultaneously everywhere. The Tetrad, with its fourfold Möbius topological structure of enhancement, reversal, retrieval and obsolescence, is mobilized by McLuhan and Powers to illuminate the media or technological inventions of cash money, the compass, the computer, the database, the satellite, and the global media network.\n\nIn \"Laws of Media\" (1988), published posthumously by his son Eric, McLuhan summarized his ideas about media in a concise tetrad of media effects. The tetrad is a means of examining the effects on society of any technology (i.e., any medium) by dividing its effects into four categories and displaying them simultaneously. McLuhan designed the tetrad as a pedagogical tool, phrasing his laws as questions with which to consider any medium:\n\n\nThe laws of the tetrad exist simultaneously, not successively or chronologically, and allow the questioner to explore the \"grammar and syntax\" of the \"language\" of media. McLuhan departs from his mentor Harold Innis in suggesting that a medium \"overheats\", or reverses into an opposing form, when taken to its extreme.\n\nVisually, a tetrad can be depicted as four diamonds forming an X, with the name of a medium in the centre. The two diamonds on the left of a tetrad are the \"Enhancement\" and \"Retrieval\" qualities of the medium, both \"Figure\" qualities. The two diamonds on the right of a tetrad are the \"Obsolescence\" and \"Reversal\" qualities, both \"Ground\" qualities.\n\nUsing the example of radio:\n\n\nMcLuhan adapted the Gestalt psychology idea of a \"figure and a ground\", which underpins the meaning of \"The medium is the message\". He used this concept to explain how a form of communications technology, the medium or \"figure\", necessarily operates through its context, or \"ground\".\n\nMcLuhan believed that in order to grasp fully the effect of a new technology, one must examine figure (medium) and ground (context) together, since neither is completely intelligible without the other. McLuhan argued that we must study media in their historical context, particularly in relation to the technologies that preceded them. The present environment, itself made up of the effects of previous technologies, gives rise to new technologies, which, in their turn, further affect society and individuals.\n\nAll technologies have embedded within them their own assumptions about time and space. The message which the medium conveys can only be understood if the medium and the environment in which the medium is used—and which, simultaneously, it effectively creates—are analysed together. He believed that an examination of the figure-ground relationship can offer a critical commentary on culture and society.\n\nAfter the publication of \"Understanding Media\", McLuhan received an astonishing amount of publicity, making him perhaps the most publicized English teacher in the twentieth century and arguably the most controversial. This publicity began with the work of two California advertising executives, Howard Gossage and Gerald Feigen who used personal funds to fund their practice of \"genius scouting.\" Much enamoured with McLuhan's work, Feigen and Gossage arranged for McLuhan to meet with editors of several major New York magazines in May 1965 at the Lombardy Hotel in New York. Philip Marchand reports that, as a direct consequence of these meetings, McLuhan was offered the use of an office in the headquarters of both \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\", any time he needed it.\n\nIn August 1965, Feigen and Gossage held what they called a \"McLuhan festival\" in the offices of Gossage's advertising agency in San Francisco. During this \"festival\", McLuhan met with advertising executives, members of the mayor's office, and editors from the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" and \"Ramparts\" magazine. More significant was the presence at the festival of Tom Wolfe, who wrote about McLuhan in a subsequent article, \"What If He Is Right?\", published in \"New York Magazine\" and Wolfe's own \"The Pump House Gang\". According to Feigen and Gossage, their work had only a moderate effect on McLuhan's eventual celebrity: they claimed that their work only \"probably speeded up the recognition of [McLuhan's] genius by about six months.\" In any case, McLuhan soon became a fixture of media discourse. \"Newsweek\" magazine did a cover story on him; articles appeared in \"Life Magazine\", \"Harper's\", \"Fortune\", \"Esquire\", and others. Cartoons about him appeared in \"The New Yorker\". In 1969, \"Playboy\" magazine published a lengthy interview with him. In a running gag on the popular sketch comedy \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\", the \"poet\" Henry Gibson would randomly say, \"Marshall McLuhan, what are you doin'?\"\n\nMcLuhan was credited with coining the phrase \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" by its popularizer, Timothy Leary, in the 1960s. In a 1988 interview with Neil Strauss, Leary stated that slogan was \"given to him\" by McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary said McLuhan \"was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that’s a lot,' to the tune of a Pepsi commercial. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.'\"\n\nDuring his lifetime and afterward, McLuhan heavily influenced cultural critics, thinkers, and media theorists such as Neil Postman, Jean Baudrillard, Timothy Leary, Terence McKenna, William Irwin Thompson, Paul Levinson, Douglas Rushkoff, Jaron Lanier, Hugh Kenner, and John David Ebert, as well as political leaders such as Pierre Elliott Trudeau and Jerry Brown. Andy Warhol was paraphrasing McLuhan with his now famous \"15 minutes of fame\" quote. When asked in the 1970s for a way to sedate violences in Angola, he suggested a massive spread of TV devices. The character \"Brian O'Blivion\" in David Cronenberg's 1983 film Videodrome is a \"media oracle\" based on McLuhan. In 1991, McLuhan was named as the \"patron saint\" of \"Wired Magazine\" and a quote of his appeared on the masthead for the first ten years of its publication. He is mentioned by name in a Peter Gabriel-penned lyric in the song \"Broadway Melody of 1974\". This song appears on the concept album \"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\", from progressive rock band Genesis. The lyric is: \"Marshall McLuhan, casual viewin' head buried in the sand.\" McLuhan is also jokingly referred to during an episode of \"The Sopranos\" entitled \"House Arrest\". Despite his death in 1980, someone claiming to be McLuhan was posting on a \"Wired\" mailing list in 1996. The information this individual provided convinced one writer for \"Wired\" that \"if the poster was not McLuhan himself, it was a bot programmed with an eerie command of McLuhan's life and inimitable perspective.\"\n\nA new centre known as the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology, formed soon after his death in 1980, was the successor to McLuhan's Centre for Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto. Since 1994, it has been part of the University of Toronto Faculty of Information and in 2008 the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology incorporated in the Coach House Institute. The first director was literacy scholar and OISE Professor David R. Olsen. From 1983 until 2008, the McLuhan Program was under the direction of Dr. Derrick de Kerckhove who was McLuhan's student and translator. From 2008 through 2015 Professor Dominique Scheffel-Dunand of York University served Director of the Program.\nIn 2011 at the time of his centenary the Coach House Institute established a Marshall McLuhan Centenary Fellowship program in his honor, and each year appoints up to four fellows for a maximum of two years. In May 2016 the Coach House Institute was renamed the McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology; its Interim Director was Seamus Ross (2015–16). Sarah Sharma, an Associate Professor of Media Theory from the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology (ICCIT) and the Faculty of Information (St. George), began a five-year term as director of the Coach House (2017- ). Professor Sharma's research and teaching focuses on feminist approaches to technology, including issues related to temporality and media. Professor Sharma's thematic for the 2017-2018 Monday Night Seminars at the McLuhan Centre is MsUnderstanding Media which extends and introduces feminist approaches to technology to McLuhan's formulations of technology and culture.\n\nIn Toronto, Marshall McLuhan Catholic Secondary School is named after him.\n\nThis is a partial list of works cited in this article.

The program was developed in collaboration with the speakers of six indigenous California languages: Karuk, Hupa, Yurok, Wintu, Yowlumne, and Mojave. The MALLP ran for the first time in the summer of 1993, and has grown each year since its inception. By 1996, only three years after it began, the program funded 26 teams, covering the original six languages, as well as Patwin, Paiute, and Kiliwa. Since its creation, the program has been adopted by several other endangered indigenous language groups, including Aboriginal groups in Australia and British Columbia, Canada, where it is now referred to as the Mentor-Apprentice Program. Onowa McIvor and Peter Jacobs from the University of Victoria, in particular, conducted a study of Mentor-Apprentice learners in BC and determined that this program is particularly effective for teaching adults.\n\nThe program was designed to be easily utilized by groups without extensive linguistic training, allowing communities to use the program on their own. It was also designed to align with the traditional learning style of California indigenous groups, which favours a one-on-one, voluntary learning environment, as opposed to the Western model of education that emphasizes competition among students and negative consequences for poor performance (i.e. poor grades). The need for a program like the MALLP was evident due to the resource- and people-heavy nature of school-based language revitalization programs, like those used among the Maori, Irish, Hawaiians, and Welsh. In addition, most of the parental generation of indigenous California communities no longer spoke their ancestral language, eliminating the possibility of revitalization through use of the language in the home. Because of these issues, the MALLP was developed with the aim of assisting young professionals in these communities, and current and future parents, to become proficient speakers of their language.\n\nThe main goal of the MALLP is that the apprentice attains proficiency in their language over a few years, through the creation of mini-immersion settings within each team. To create the mini-immersion settings, the teams are encouraged to go about their daily lives as normal, for a minimum number of hours per week, but to always communicate in the language that is being learned. The program incorporates techniques from several language-learning programs, including Total Physical Response.\n\nThe MALLP is based on ten main points:\n"}

The \"orgion\" is in particular a cult ceremony of Dionysos (or Zagreus), celebrated widely in Arcadia, featuring \"unrestrained\" masked dances by torchlight and animal sacrifice by means of random slashing that evoked the god's own rending and suffering at the hands of the Titans.\n\n\"Orgia\" may have been earlier manifestations of cult than the formal mysteries, as suggested by the violently ecstatic rites described in myth as celebrated by Attis in honor of Cybele and reflected in the willing self-castration of her priests the Galli in the historical period. The \"orgia\" of both Dionysian worship and the cult of Cybele aim at breaking down barriers between the celebrants and the divinity through a state of mystic exaltation:\n\nInitiates of the Orphic and Bacchic \"orgia\" practiced distinctive burial customs (see \"Totenpass\") expressive of their beliefs in an afterlife; for instance, it was forbidden for the dead to wear wool.\n\nMembers of a group devoted to performing \"orgia\" are called \"orgeônes\", whose activities were regulated by law. The cult of the Thracian goddess Bendis was organized at Athens by her \"orgeônes\" as early as the Archaic period.\n\nThe participation of women in \"orgia\", which in some manifestations was exclusive to women, sometimes led to prurient speculation and attempts to suppress the rites. In 186 BC, the Roman senate tried to ban Dionysian religion as subversive both morally and politically.\n\nIsidore of Seville says that the Latin equivalent of \"orgia\" was \"caerimoniae\" (English \"ceremonies\"), the arcane rites of ancient Roman religion preserved by the various colleges of priests.\n\n"}
{"id": "48481843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48481843", "title": "Pseudo-athlete", "text": "Pseudo-athlete\n\nPseudo-athlete is a concept in Roman portraiture, favored in the late Republican Period, to describe a sculpture that has a combination of a veristic head and an idealized body. Verism shows the person portrayed without idealizing features, with warts, wrinkles, and other physical defects and deformities. Verism goes beyond a realistic rendering. There was a positive value of age and experience in Rome, so it manipulates the facial expression in an attempt to convey the stern traditional Roman values. One of the potential origins of the veristic style is from Roman funeral masks. The masks were used to give an impersonation of the deceased at the Roman Forum. Therefore, it was critical that the masks reproduced the appearance of the deceased and portrayed all of their features. The public funerals were to portray the character of the deceased, so artists were encouraged to make the masks as expressive as possible using the traditionally prized Roman values: stern moral seriousness (\"gravitas\"), firmness and strictness of judgement (\"severitas\"), determination and self-possession (\"constantia\"), and so on. While the origin of verism is highly debated as to whether it was from Italic, Etruscan, Roman, Egyptian, or Greek influence, the purpose for realistic, unidealized rendering was specific. The signs of age were used as indicators of wisdom and authority. The body remains idealized due to Greek influence. In Greek sculpture there is a concept of heroic nudity. It is used to indicate that a sculpture's apparently mortal human subject is in fact a hero or semi-divine being.\n\nThe Pseudo-athlete of Delos is a life-size nude male portrait that was found in the House of the Diadoumenos on the Greek island of Delos. It belonged to a Roman business man and dates back to 100 BCE. Stylistic traits of Greek sculpture, such as the contrapposto of the Polykleitan original and the sharp upturn of the head reminiscent of Hellenistic sculpture, were incorporated. In contrast, the bald head, prominent ears, and wrinkled face is reminiscent of the Republican style, as is the combination of the veristic head with the idealized body. The idealized nude body is symbolic of the concept of heroic nudity in Greek sculpture. The realistic head is symbolic of wisdom and experience that comes with age. In Greek portraiture, the head and body show a consistent age. However, in the Roman pseudo-athlete there is a disconnect. The draped cloth carefully placed across the left shoulder is reminiscent of the Roman toga, while the nude body is typical in Greek statues. The body is used as a prop for the head. In the Delos pseudo-athlete, nudity is used as a costume or garment since the business man would not have appeared nude in public or in front of his guests. The combination of the Greek style body with a Roman head makes the sculpture from Delos a great example of the Roman pseudo-athlete.\n\nIn Tivoli, at the Sanctuary of Hercules, a pseudo-athlete portrait of a general was found. The marble sculpture with a veristic Roman head and idealized Greek body dates back to 75-50 BCE. To show his rank in the army and hold up the heavy marble statue, there is a cuirass at his side. His typical Republican stern and wrinkled face is contrasted by a youthful almost nude body that exudes power and is in the tradition of a Hellenistic ruler. Through the reference back to Greek idealized body, the patron expresses cultural superiority. The general exudes modesty by using a draped cloth to cover his genitals.\n"}

As revenge, Ruatapu enticed the children of the nobility into his canoe, sailed them in the ocean, and then sank it (Craig 1989:237). Kahutia-te-rangi survived with the help of a whale and was thereafter known as Paikea (Reedy 1993:142-146). \n\nMeanwhile, Ruatapu convinced the gods of the tides to destroy the land and its inhabitants. Paikea fled to high ground and was saved through the intervention of the goddess Moa-kura-manu. One version of the myth holds that Ruatapu drowned in the flood and that his bowels became the first jellyfish (Craig 1989:237, Reedy 1989:142-146).\n\nIn a tradition of the Ngati Porou, a Māori tribe of the east coast of New Zealand's North Island, Ruatapu became angry when his father Uenuku elevated his younger half-brother Kahutia-te-rangi ahead of him. Ruatapu lured Kahutia-te-rangi and a large number of young men of high birth into his canoe, and took them out to sea where he drowned them. He called on the gods to destroy his enemies and threatened to return as the great waves of early summer. As he struggled for his life, Kahutia-te-rangi recited an incantation invoking the southern humpback whales (\"paikea\" in Māori) to carry him ashore. Accordingly, he was renamed Paikea, and was the only survivor (Reedy 1997:83-85).\n"}

The Church of Saint Senara, Zennor is dedicated to her; the village, nearby headland Zennor Head, and the neolithic tomb Zennor Quoit received her name indirectly.\n\nAccording to scholar Nicholas Orme, a Saint Sinar of Zennor was first recorded in 1170 as a male saint (\"Sanctus Sinar\"), but from 1235 onwards as a female one (\"Sancta Sinara\"). Orme states that unless she can be identified with Azenor, the mother of Saint Budoc in Breton legends, nothing else is recorded about her. He also points out the similarity to Saint Senan, commemorated at nearby Sennen.\n\nSenara was reputedly a Breton princess of Brest originally named Asenora, a woman described as having a \"rather dubious reputation\" before her conversion. She was married to a Breton king who wrongly accused her of adultery and threw her into the sea in a barrel while pregnant. She was visited by an angel, whilst floating in the sea off the westernmost end of Cornwall, and gave birth to a son in the waves, who later became Saint Budoc or an Irish bishop. She was washed up on the Cornish coast, and some believe she founded Zennor and gave her name to the eponymous village (and subsequently Zennor Head, Zennor Quoit and Porthzennor Cove), before continuing to Ireland.\n\nDue to the striking similarity, the legend's origins possibly lie in Greek mythology and the story of Danaë who was also cast to sea with her son Perseus in a wooden box.\n\nSenara was highly venerated by local fishermen and is said to represent the dual nature of Christ (human and divine). Medieval folk regarded her as a symbol of lust and a warning against the sins of the flesh due to her story of purported adultery and subsequent conversion. She gives her name to St Senara's Church in Zennor and it contains the Mermaid Chair, an ancient chair with carvings of fish on the seat and a pew end with a depiction of the mermaid admiring herself in a mirror, which is believed to be at least 600 years old. A statue of St Senara lies in an enclosed garden next to the church.\n\nSenara is the subject of a book and linked to the Mermaid of Zennor by Sue Monk Kidd, \"The Mermaid Chair\", which was adapted into a movie in 2006.\n"}

AD 800, resulting in a modern \"segnen\" \"to bless\". The noun \"Segen\" \"blessing\" was derived from the verb at an early time, attested in the 9th century as \"segan\".\nOld English hat the corresponding \"sægnan\", which survives as the dialectal (esp. Scottish) \"sain\" (popularized by Scott, \"Heart of Mid-Lothian\" \"God sain us\").\nThe concept of \"Segen\", understood magically, was very productive in the folklore, folk religion and superstition of German-speaking Europe, studied in great detail by the German philologists and folklorists of the 19th century.\n\nThe medieval church used the \"Segen\" (the sign of the cross with a spoken formula) liberally, intended as an act with protective effect, putting the person or thing blessed under the protection of God. Nor was the action reserved for priests or clerics, but any Christian was permitted to make the sign of the cross and invoke the protection of God. Thus the \"Segen\" came to be seen as the inverse of the curse (\"Fluch\"), magical acts with the power to either protect or harm. \nThe concept of \"Segen\" thus became the continuant of the incantation formulas of the pre-Christian period (the only surviving samples of which are the Merseburg Incantations).\n\nUse of such formulas was partly encouraged by the Church, as they did superficially involve an expression of piety by the invocation of God, Christ or the Virgin Mary, but at the same time their magical use was viewed with scepticism and was sometimes repressed.\nBy the time of the Early Modern witch-hunts, the term \"segen\" had become ambiguous, and depending on context could refer to a harmless farewell, to a pious invocation of God, or to a Satanic or superstitious spell (\"pro incantamento et adjuratione magica\" Stieler 1669; e.g. \"Wolfssegen\" \"contra lupos\").\nThis early modern usage survives in dialectal variation throughout the rural parts of German-speaking Europe.\nFor German-speaking Switzerland, the \"Schweizerisches Idiotikon\" 7,444 \"Sëgeⁿ\" \nrecords some two dozen compounds in \"-sëgeⁿ\", in some of which \"Segen\" takes the meaning \"prayer\" and in others \"spell, charm\".\n\nA notable concept in Swiss folklore is the \"Alpsegen\" (\"Alpe(n)sëgeⁿ, Alpsëgeⁿ\" 7,451), a folk religious custom in Alpine Switzerland where every night \na prayer must be sung over each Alpine pasture. This combined the function of an apotropaic charm with a practical aspect of communicating between remote pastures; if the \"Alpsegen\" was not heard from a neighbouring site, it would be a sign that a misfortune or accident had befallen and the neighbours would come to aid.\n"}
{"id": "5170076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5170076", "title": "Shotel", "text": "Shotel\n\nA shotel is a curved sword originating in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian swordsmen who were trained in using this weapon were known as shotelai. The curve on the shotel's blade varies from the Persian shamshir, adopting an almost semicircular shape. The blade is flat and double-edged with a diamond cross-section. The blade is about in total length and the hilt is a simple wooden piece with no guard. The shotel was carried in a close fitting leather scabbard.\n\nEvidence for the shotel dates from the earliest Damotians (Damites) and Axumites, used by both mounted and dismounted warriors. After the Solomonic restoration of Atse Yikuno Amlak I, the resurgent Emperors began to re-establish the Axumite armies. This culminated in the reign of Amda Seyon I. Ethiopian forces were armed with short and long swords such as the Seif and Gorade. The Shotel swordsmen known as Shotelai and organized in the Axurarat Shotelai comprised one of the elite forces of Amda Seyon's Imperial host. Along with the Hareb Gonda and Korem cavalry, Keste Nihb archers and Axuarat Axuarai lancers were said to be the forces that \"flew through the air like the eagle and spun on the ground like the avalanche\", by a contemporaneous historian. Shotel techniques among others included hooking attacks both against mounted and dismounted opponents that had devastating effect especially against mounted cavalry. The shotel could be used to hook and rip the warrior off the horse. Classically the Shotel was employed in a dismounted state to hook the opponent by reaching around a shield or any other defensive implement or weapon.\n\nIts shape is similar to a big sickle and can be effectively used to reach around an opponent's shield and stab them in vital areas, such as the kidneys or lungs. It is closely resembled by the Afar Gile. The Gile has two cutting edges, while the shotel's upper edge is unsharpened and sometimes used braced against the swordsman's shield for strength. The Shotel and other Ethiopian swords are occasionally referred collectively in Geez as Han'e.\n\nHowever, the mid-18th century European visitor to Ethiopia, Remedius Prutky, often used the word \"shotel\" to describe a carving knife.\n\n"}

The PS2, GameCube, and Wii versions are all ports of the same game developed by Blitz Games, while the GBA, Nintendo DS and PC versions were separate games developed by WayForward Technologies and AWE Games respectively. It is based on the Nickelodeon animated sitcom \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", and stars the title character, his best friend Patrick Star, and their enemy Plankton as they journey to nine different worlds, supposedly, inside the dreams of the characters. The Wii version was a North American launch title. It is also the first \"SpongeBob\" game released in Japan (PlayStation 2 and Wii versions), but was released under the title SpongeBob (スポンジ・ボブ \"Suponjibobu\"), to mark it as the first video game in the \"SpongeBob\" series to have a Japanese release. The Windows version of the game is titled \"SpongeBob SquarePants: Nighty Nightmare\".\n\nPlayers have access to three playable characters during the game, SpongeBob SquarePants, Patrick Starfishman (Patrick Star in superhero form), and Sheldon J. Plankton, and must guide them through nine levels of play in a dreamworld. Four different types of gameplay have been incorporated into the game, known as flying, rampaging, racing, and platforming. During flying sections, the game sets obstacles, one in front of another, and the player must maneuver past them. In most cases, the game will tell the player which way to fly (up, down, left, and right). On the Wii, the player uses the controller like an actual plane control stick. The most common cases of this is when SpongeBob uses his plane to attack a giant-sized Plankton. In rampage levels, the player controls a giant sized Plankton and uses special powers and moves to destroy everything in their path. The player's laser power is indicated by a bar on the right side of the screen, which refills after use. The Wii version features controller movements that respectively activate moves. Racing gameplay is similar to most racing games; it is featured in both the air and the ground's gameplay, fuel must be collected in order to keep the player's vehicle running. The platforming gameplay is spread throughout the game, such as when Plankton must escape from a live Krabby Patty or when Patrick Starfishman saves Bikini Bottom from his evil form, Dreaded Patrick.\n\nIn a dream, SpongeBob's bed transforms into a hot rod and he drives it around a track across Bikini Bottom, which now resembles an art style inspired by the works of Ed Roth. After several races against Patrick, Plankton and Gary, he accidentally drives into an unnoticed pit.\n\nIn another dream, Patrick is a superhero named \"Starfishman\" in a cel-shaded comic book-like world where everyone resembles him. Starfishman pursues the villainous \"Dreaded Patrick\", who attempts to remake the town in his own image. Starfishman goes around town beating his minions, getting clothes for a man after saving him from a train, and giving the mayor laundry detergent to help \"clean up the town\". Starfishman eventually beats Dreaded Patrick in a battle at his secret lair. However, Starfishman fails to see a surprise attack. He is tied to a rocket and launched into outer space, where he hits an asteroid, a piece of which falls to Earth and traps Dreaded Patrick.\n\nIn yet another dream, Plankton zaps a crumb of a Krabby Patty with his Enlargatron Ray. However, the ray's coordinates are inaccurate, causing the Krabby Patty to overgrow and mutate into a vicious living patty. Plankton decides to fight back with size but the inaccurate ray only makes him the height of an average citizen, not enough to dwarf the patty. Plankton, carrying only his freeze ray, is pursued by the patty throughout Bikini Bottom. The patty ultimately loses Plankton when he hides. However, Plankton gloats about his victory and is spotted. The patty leaps forward and crushes Plankton.\n\nReturning to SpongeBob awakening, he reaches the bottom of the pit he drove into and is eaten by an Alaskan Bull Worm. He encounters Old Man Jenkins, who is building a biplane to escape the bowels of the worm. Within the worm, SpongeBob locates spare parts from the chief of a village inside and an inventor for the biplane, he also gets rid of a huge can of chili that's causing the worm stomach problems.\n\nIn outer space, an awakening Starfishman manages to untie himself from the rocket after flying around. He shoots asteroids guarding a space station and continues to fly around until he meets up with a U.F.O. in the shape of a patty. He shoots off its wings, destroying it. Then Patrick returns to Earth while trying figure out how to stop the rocket.\n\nPlankton awakes to find the giant Krabby Patty sleeping beside him. As he sneaks away, Karen's wake-up call awakens the patty. Plankton sets the accurate coordinates for his ray and makes himself giant monster-sized. The patty flees and Plankton gives chase, destroying Bikini Bottom in his wake. He finds the patty hiding in a skyscraper and destroys each floor to force it out. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Jenkins forcibly exit the worm's mouth and find Plankton. The giant patty escapes Plankton's clutches and clings onto SpongeBob's plane. Enraged, Plankton pursues the plane.\n\nSpongeBob tries to avoid Plankton while devising a plan to defeat him. After a long pursuit through the city, including the sewers and a construction site, SpongeBob engages Plankton on a radio tower. SpongeBob destroys the support bolts to make the tower unstable, causing Plankton to fall on his rear. As Plankton aches in pain, SpongeBob feels sorry for him and decides to help him up. Plankton then captures SpongeBob.\n\nStarfishman arrives from outer space and teams up with Mermaid Man and the Bikini Bottom Defence Force Army to battle giant Plankton and rescue SpongeBob. Several other plankton arrive on the rooftops to get rid of him. After four battles, Starfishman must locate a shrink ray to shrink Plankton.\nAfter Plankton is shrunk, he accompanies Patrick and SpongeBob into a dream bubble, where they meet a doctor with a Krabby Patty for a head. The doctor explains that the reason for their bizarre dreams is because they all ate a Krabby Patty before falling asleep; the chemical composition of the patties affected their biorhythms and caused a reaction that resulted in the dreams. SpongeBob then asks the doctor how he knows so much about Krabby Patties; the doctor strips his outfit off to reveal that he is the Krabby Patty in their own dreams. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton chase after him and head into the final level where they race against one another for the Krabby Patty trophy in a bizarre, nightmare-like racetrack. The game starts off with SpongeBob as the only choice available. To unlock Patrick and Plankton, the player must collect Sleepy Seeds spread throughout the game. The level's ending depends on which character the player wins with:\n\nIn the ultimate ending, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton wake up in one another's dream and it is revealed that this was all Gary's dream, who was the one who ate the Krabby Patty. After waking up, he goes around town and sees SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton, who are acting just like in his dream. He then returns home to rest. SpongeBob brings back a Krabby Patty for Gary, who refuses to eat it because it may give him nightmares. Gary then watches as SpongeBob has a \"conversation\" with the patty. As SpongeBob prepares to eat the patty, he is eaten by the Alaskan Bull Worm, causing Gary to faint into slumber.\n\nDeveloper Blitz Games had a meeting with staff from THQ during the 2005 E3 trade show, where they were asked to oversee and develop the SpongeBob SquarePants franchise. THQ staff revealed that they had an \"intimate\" business relationship with Nintendo, and that Nintendo had expressed an interest in having a SpongeBob game published on their new console, the Wii, which at that point was still known by its development name Revolution. Blitz came up with several styles of play during development, some of which did not become part of the finished product. In particular, shooting sections using the Wiimote had been considered, but license holders Nickelodeon were uncomfortable with them due to SpongeBob SquarePants being a cartoon. Due to Blitz developing their own middleware with a focus on providing cross-platform compatibility, the main sections of the game such as driving and platforming are the same for each console version of the game. The mini game controls work differently on the Wii version of the game, the Nintendo console was the main focus of development. Extra development time was spent configuring the control methods for the Wiimote and the standard controllers used on the other consoles.\n\nThe game was announced prior to the 2006 E3 show, and was first shown to journalists at that event.\n\nThe game was nominated for an Annie Award for best animated video game in 2006. It also won the award for favorite video game at the 2007 Kids' Choice Awards. The game received mixed to average reviews in addition to some more positive or negative ratings. Nintendo Power referred to the game as the \"most ambitious and most successful SpongeBob game to date\" in their December 2006 issue. Some positive aspects noted by reviewers about it included the variety in gameplay, responsive controls on the GC and PS2 versions, straightforward and solid level design, and the game's overrall ambition, while negatives points included subpar graphics, especially on the GC version, overly long and poorly paced platforming and racing levels, and the occasionally unresponsive motion controls on the Wii version.\n\nSeveral reviewers also noted that the fictional world does not resemble Bikini Bottom or the cartoon itself, that the story and overall tone is slightly darker and more surreal compared to previous games, and that the game does not \"feel\" like a SpongeBob SquarePants title.\n\n"}
{"id": "90191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=90191", "title": "The Golden Bough", "text": "The Golden Bough\n\nThe Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion (retitled The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion in its second edition) is a wide-ranging, comparative study of mythology and religion, written by the Scottish anthropologist Sir James George Frazer. \"The Golden Bough\" was first published in two volumes in 1890; in three volumes in 1900; and in twelve volumes in the third edition, published 1906–15. It has also been published in several different one-volume abridgments. The work was aimed at a wide literate audience raised on tales as told in such publications as Thomas Bulfinch's \"The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes\" (1855). The influence of \"The Golden Bough\" on contemporary European literature and thought was substantial.\n\nFrazer attempted to define the shared elements of religious belief and scientific thought, discussing fertility rites, human sacrifice, the dying god, the scapegoat, and many other symbols and practices whose influences had extended into 20th-century culture. His thesis is that old religions were fertility cults that revolved around the worship and periodic sacrifice of a sacred king. Frazer proposed that mankind progresses from magic through religious belief to scientific thought.\n\nFrazer's thesis was developed in relation to J. M. W. Turner's painting of \"The Golden Bough\", a sacred grove where a certain tree grew day and night. It was a transfigured landscape in a dream-like vision of the woodland lake of Nemi, \"Diana's Mirror\", where religious ceremonies and the \"fulfillment of vows\" of priests and kings were held.\n\nThe king was the incarnation of a dying and reviving god, a solar deity who underwent a mystic marriage to a goddess of the Earth. He died at the harvest and was reincarnated in the spring. Frazer claims that this legend of rebirth is central to almost all of the world's mythologies.\n\nFrazer based his thesis on the pre-Roman priest-king at the fane of Nemi, who was ritually murdered by his successor:\n\nWhen I first put pen to paper to write \"The Golden Bough\" I had no conception of the magnitude of the voyage on which I was embarking; I thought only to explain a single rule of an ancient Italian priesthood. (\"Aftermath\", p. vi)\n\nThe book's title was taken from an incident in the \"Aeneid\", illustrated by Turner, in which Aeneas and the Sibyl present the golden bough to the gatekeeper of Hades to gain admission.\n\nFrazer wrote in a preface to the third edition of \"The Golden Bough\" that while he had never studied Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, his friend James Ward, and the philosopher J. M. E. McTaggart, had both suggested to him that Hegel had anticipated his view of \"the nature and historical relations of magic and religion\". Frazer saw the resemblance as being that \"we both hold that in the mental evolution of humanity an age of magic preceded an age of religion, and that the characteristic difference between magic and religion is that, whereas magic aims at controlling nature directly, religion aims at controlling it indirectly through the mediation of a powerful supernatural being or beings to whom man appeals for help and protection.\" Frazer included an extract from Hegel's \"Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion\" (1832).\n\n\"The Golden Bough\" scandalized the British public when first published, as it included the Christian story of Jesus and the Resurrection in its comparative study. Critics thought this treatment invited an agnostic reading of the Lamb of God as a relic of a pagan religion. For the third edition, Frazer placed his analysis of the Crucifixion in a speculative appendix; the discussion of Christianity was excluded from the single-volume abridged edition.\n\nFrazer himself accepted that his theories were speculative and that the associations he made were circumstantial and usually based only on resemblance. He wrote: \"Books like mine, merely speculation, will be superseded sooner or later (the sooner the better for the sake of truth) by better induction based on fuller knowledge.\" In 1922, at the inauguration of the Frazer Lectureship in Anthropology, he said: \"It is my earnest wish that the lectureship should be used solely for the disinterested pursuit of truth, and not for the dissemination and propagation of any theories or opinions of mine.\" Godfrey Lienhardt notes that even during Frazer's lifetime, social anthropologists \"had for the most part distanced themselves from his theories and opinions\", and that the lasting influence of \"The Golden Bough\" and Frazer's wider body of work \"has been in the literary rather than the academic world.\"\n\nRobert Ackerman writes that, for British social anthropologists, Frazer is still \"an embarrassment\" for being \"the most famous of them all\" while they now dissociate themselves \"from much that he wrote.\" While \"The Golden Bough\" achieved wide \"popular appeal\" and exerted a \"disproportionate\" influence \"on so many [20th century] creative writers\", Frazer's ideas played \"a much smaller part\" in the history of academic social anthropology. Lienhardt himself dismissed Frazer's interpretations of primitive religion as \"little more than plausible constructs of [Frazer's] own Victorian rationalism\", while \nLudwig Wittgenstein, in his \"Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough\" (1979), wrote: \"Frazer is much more savage than most of his 'savages' [since] his explanations of [their] observances are much cruder than the sense of the observances themselves.\"\n\nInitially, the book's influence on the emerging discipline of anthropology was pervasive. For example, the Polish anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski read Frazer's work in the original English, and afterwards wrote: \"No sooner had I read this great work than I became immersed in it and enslaved by it. I realized then that anthropology, as presented by Sir James Frazer, is a great science, worthy of as much devotion as any of her elder and more exact studies and I became bound to the service of Frazerian anthropology.\" However, by the 1920s, Frazer's ideas \"began to belong to the past\": \n\nEdmund Leach, \"one of the most impatient critics of Frazer's overblown prose and literary embellishment of his sources for dramatic effect\", was scathing of the artistic license exercised by Frazer in \"The Golden Bough\", saying: \"Frazer used his ethnographic evidence, which he culled from here, there and everywhere, to \"illustrate\" propositions which he had arrived at in advance by \"a priori\" reasoning, but, to a degree which is often quite startling, whenever the evidence did not fit he simply altered the evidence!\"\n\nRené Girard, a French historian, literary critic, and philosopher of social science, \"grudgingly\" praised Frazer for recognising kingly sacrifice as \"a key primitive ritual\", but described his interpretation of the ritual as \"a grave injustice to ethnology.\" Girard's \"grievances\" against \"The Golden Bough\" were numerous, particularly concerning Frazer's assertion that Christianity was merely a perpetuation of primitive myth-ritualism and that the New Testament Gospels were \"just further myths of the death and resurrection of the king who embodies the god of vegetation.\" Girard himself considered the Gospels to be \"revelatory texts\" rather than myths or the remains of \"ignorant superstition\", and rejected Frazer's idea that the death of Jesus was a sacrifice, \"whatever definition we may give for that sacrifice.\"\n\nDespite the controversy generated by the work, and its critical reception amongst other scholars, \"The Golden Bough\" inspired much of the creative literature of the period. The poet Robert Graves adapted Frazer's concept of the dying king sacrificed for the good of the kingdom to the romantic idea of the poet's suffering for the sake of his Muse-Goddess, as reflected in his book on poetry, rituals, and myths, \"The White Goddess\" (1948). William Butler Yeats refers to Frazer's thesis in his poem \"Sailing to Byzantium\". The horror writer H. P. Lovecraft's understanding of religion was influenced by \"The Golden Bough\", and Lovecraft mentions the book in his short story \"The Call of Cthulhu\". T. S. Eliot acknowledged indebtedness to Frazer in his first note to his poem \"The Waste Land\". William Carlos Williams refers to \"The Golden Bough\" in Book Two, part two, of his extended poem in five books \"Paterson\". \"The Golden Bough\" influenced Sigmund Freud's work \"Totem and Taboo\" (1913). Frazer's work also influenced the psychiatrist Carl Jung, the novelist James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, and the novelist D. H. Lawrence.\n\nThe mythologist Joseph Campbell drew on \"The Golden Bough\" in \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" (1949), where he accepted Frazer's view that mythology is a primitive attempt to explain the world of nature, though considering it only one among a number of valid explanations of mythology. Campbell later described Frazer's work as \"monumental\". The anthropologist Weston La Barre, writing in \"The Human Animal\" (1955), described Frazer as \"the last of the scholastics\" and wrote that Frazer's work was \"an extended footnote to a line in Virgil he felt he did not understand.\" The lyrics of the musician Jim Morrison's song \"Not to Touch the Earth\" were influenced by the table of contents of \"The Golden Bough\". The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's commentaries on \"The Golden Bough\" have been compiled as \"Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough\", edited by Rush Rhees, originally published in 1967 (the English edition followed in 1979). Robert Ackerman, in his \"The Myth and Ritual School: J. G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists\" (1991), sets Frazer in the broader context of the history of ideas. The myth and ritual school includes scholars Jane Harrison, Gilbert Murray, F. M. Cornford, and A.B. Cook, who were connecting the new discipline of myth theory and anthropology with traditional literary classics at the end of the 19th century, influencing Modernist literature.\n\nThe critic Camille Paglia has cited \"The Golden Bough\" as one of the most important influences on her book \"Sexual Personae\" (1990), and described it as \"a model of intriguing specificity wed to speculative imagination.\" Paglia acknowledged that \"many details in Frazer have been contradicted or superseded\", but maintained that the work of Frazer's Cambridge school of classical anthropology \"will remain inspirational for enterprising students seeking escape from today's sterile academic climate.\" Paglia has also commented, however, that the one-volume abridgement of \"The Golden Bough\" is \"bland\" and should be \"avoided like the plague.\"\n\n\n1937 edition: \"Aftermath: A Supplement to the Golden Bough\"\n\n\n\n\n\nText copies of the 1922 edition:\n\n"}

The oldest reference to Tirhuta script is Sahodara Temple of Narkatiyaganj, Bihar, dated 950 CE \nThe script has a rich history spanning a thousand years, believed to be originated in the 10th century CE, but years of neglect by Nepal and the Bihar government have taken their toll on the use of Tirhuta. It is similar to Bengali script. Most speakers of Maithili have switched to using the Devanagari script, which is also used to write neighboring Central Indic languages such as Nepali and Hindi. As a result, the number of people with a working knowledge of Tirhuta has dropped considerably in recent years.\n\nBefore 14th CE, Tirhuta was exclusively used to write Sanskrit, later Maithili was written in this script. Despite the near universal switch from Tirhuta to the Devanagari script for writing Maithili, some traditional pundits still use the script for sending one another ceremonial letters (\"pātā\") related to some important function such as marriage. Fonts for this script were developed in 2003.\n\nThe 2003 inclusion of Maithili in the VIIIth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, having accorded official recognition to it as a language independent of Hindi, there is a possibility that this might lead to efforts to re-implement Tirhuta on a wider basis, in accord with similar trends in India reinforcing separate identities. However, currently, only Maithili in the Devanagari script is officially recognized.\n\nTirhuta script uses its own signs for the positional decimal numeral system.\n\nThe first two images shown below are samples illustrating the history of Tirhuta.

{"id": "49941327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49941327", "title": "Traceroute (film)", "text": "Traceroute (film)\n\nTraceroute is a 2016 Austrian/American documentary film directed by Johannes Grenzfurthner. The autobiographical documentary and road movie deals with the history, politics and impact of nerd culture. Grenzfurthner calls his film a \"personal journey into the uncharted depths of nerd culture, a realm full of dangers, creatures and more or less precarious working conditions\", an attempt to \"chase the ghosts of nerddom's past, present and future.\" The film was co-produced by art group monochrom and Reisenbauer Film. It features music by Kasson Crooker, Hans Nieswandt, and many others.\n\nArtist and self-declared nerd Johannes Grenzfurthner is documenting his personal road trip from the West Coast to the East Coast of the United States, to introduce the audience to places and people that shaped and inspired his art and politics. Traceroute is a reflection on Grenzfurthner's own roots of nerddom, and \"On the Road style romp across the United States as he visits icons of the counterculture, the outré, and the generally questionable.\" Grenzfurthner summarizes the concept in an interview for Boing Boing: \"It is a film on biographies and obsessions and spaces of possibility – in other words something between loving embrace and merciless vivisection. Maintaining a critical meta-outlook was just as important to me as abandoning myself to unfathomable stammerings of adoration. And that all works for one simple reason: because I take a step forward, introducing myself and confessing my guilt like in Alcoholics Anonymous, only to then take off and visit the best whiskey distilleries. In my case these destinations are not whiskey makers, but people and places and symbols of a very special pop culture.\" On Film Threat he adds: \"It was important for me to take nerddom apart, not only analyzing it, but also excavating its potential for greatness.\"\n\nThe film incorporates art and illustrations by James Brothwell, Bonni Rambatan, Michael Marrak, Karin Frank, Ben Lawson, Michael Zeltner, Josh Ellingson and eSeL in a cinematic collage that draws inspiration from 1990s fanzine and punk aesthetics, BBS culture, ANSI art and fantastic art. UK Film Review's Hannah Sayer summarizes the artistic style of the film in her review: \"There is a real sense that this is a collaborative exploration of creativity: of the old and the new, the past and the present, and the traditional and the digital. The use of photography and drawings interspersed between the interviews with various people associated with nerd culture shows an artistic approach to the material and these images act as reflective snapshots of moments in time, reinforcing the importance of looking back to the past as well as looking forward to the future of the digital age.\"\n\nTraceroute features interviews with Matt Winston, Sandy Stone, Bruce Sterling, Jason Scott, Christina Agapakis, Trevor Paglen, Ryan Finnigan, Kit Stubbs, V. Vale, Sean Bonner, Allison Cameron, Josh Ellingson, Maggie Mayhem, Paolo Pedercini, Steve Tolin, Dan Wilcox, Jon Lebkowsky, Jan \"Varka\" Mulders (of Bad Dragon), Adam Flynn, Abie Hadjitarkhani, Kelly Poots, and some special guest appearances (e.g. NPS spokesperson Vickie Carson, hacker Nick Farr and cultural curator Scott Beale).\n\nMetronaut writes: \"Traceroute offers deep insights into the world of nerddom. A woman who creates cheese from bacteria on sweaty feet. A man who wants to construct a giant network of independent Geiger counters. Or a sex worker who identifies as a nerd. The multitude of topics and people shows how being a nerd is not restricted to programming and computers.\"\n\nGrenzfurthner performed a stand-up show called \"Schicksalsjahre eines Nerds\" at Vienna's Rabenhof Theater in 2014. Parts of this show form the basis of Traceroute. The basic script, although many scenes and interviews were improvised, was written by Johannes Grenzfurthner. The film's main language is English, but features archival footage in German.\n\nPrincipal photography commenced on March 5, 2015 and ended March 27, 2015. The film can be considered microfilmmaking and guerrilla filmmaking.\n\nDaniel Hasibar and Christian Staudacher created the sound design and audioscape underlying Grenzfurthner's narration.\n\nThe film features music by Peter Barnett, Kasson Crooker, Damien Di Fede, Matthew Huffaker, Brady Leo, Vera Lynn, Kevin MacLeod, Hans Nieswandt, Roger Sandega, Eric Skiff, among others.\n\nThe film's World Premiere took place at NYC Independent Film Festival on April 28, 2016.

Bradley Gibson of \"Film Threat\" gives Traceroute 10/10 points and writes: \"Traceroute is the most fun I've ever had watching a documentary. If you're a nerd (and you are) this is the road trip you've always wanted to take with your smartest, geekiest friend. You're not going to want to come home. It's Cosmos. It's DragonCon on wheels. It's your favorite sex fantasy. It's alcohol soaked nonviolent subversive protest mobile and WiFi linked. It's \"On The Road\" updated with tech, science, pseudoscience, sex, and fandom.\" Mental Floss' Chris Higgins writes about Traceroute: \"As many nerds have noticed, there's a glut of nerd-positive documentaries out there, but they tend to be either too self-serious, or too focused on the trappings of fandom to actually say much. Traceroute manages to be a real film, with humor and true insight (sometimes called out for us—and delightfully nullified—with a blinking 'INSIGHT' faux-HTML tag onscreen), primarily because it focuses on Grenzfurthner's personal journey, and he doesn't take himself too seriously. Let's put that another way: The director uses himself and a handful of subjects to create his story, and that specificity—coupled with his playfulness—makes it work. At one point he licks the chrome head of a Terminator prop. Then he licks a zombie head prop. Then he licks the propmaster himself. It's delightful.\" Pop culture magazine Boing Boing calls Traceroute \"a brilliantly careening biography of a highly enigmatic species. [...] Traceroute is radical individual empiricism, a narrative biographical puzzle and an experimental projection matrix. Despite continual stimulus satiation, it is wonderful fun: the film tickles the synapses with a perfectly mixed cocktail of collectively shared context and quirkiness.\"\n\nPatrick Lichty of net culture magazine Furtherfield calls it \"magical (...) After watching Traceroute, I was left with a real exhilaration and a deeply reflective feeling at once. (...) What Traceroute reveals is the tradition of alterity just beneath the surface of Western culture, and that it has a powerful effect on our mass consciousness, whether it is in plain sight or not.\" Felix Knoke of Engadget Germany writes: \"For me it is the best nerd documentary I've seen so far. Simply for the fact that it doesn't take itself as deadly serious as the other ones. (...) Traceroute deserves high praise because it represents an old-school definition of nerd culture, one that is never compatible with fintech, unicorn and iGod.\" Pop culture critic Thomas Kaestle comments: \"Traceroute is game, challenge, encyclopedia, and sentimental journey all in one. As a documentary it is most skillfully composed. And as a narration it is highly compatible. This film will, in passing, sweep proclaimed nerds off their feet. And it will touch the hearts of those who still need some explanation.\" \"Diamond in the Rough Films\" praises Grenzfurthner's hosting and storytelling: \"This doc works in some very unconventional ways, not the least of which is our plucky protagonist. Grenzfurthner is an absolute charmer as our host and his narration is note-perfect (the accent is so cool in that Werner Herzog kind of way). It's really rare in a documentary about a not-that-famous person where you become almost instantly won-over and invested in their personal journey.\" Blogger and sci-fiction author Cory Doctorow states about Traceroute that \"Johannes is a brilliant lunatic of surpassing and delightful weirdness.\" MicroFilmmaker Magazine writes: \"The different people Grenzfurthner chatted with were genuinely interesting and the organic way he moved from place to place was intriguing. [...] You'll find that you've learned an awful lot about technology, nerdiness, and America.\"\n\nRichard Propes (The Independent Critic) writes: \"It's challenging. It's thought-provoking. It's remarkably honest. It's well researched. [...] If you're expecting nothing more than your usual nerd doc with its cosplay cuteness and asocial gamers, you're going to be not just disappointed but probably traumatized. Grenzfurthner is clearly full-on willing to challenge culture, stereotypes, accepted thoughts and just about everything else. There's a healthy dose of sexuality in Traceroute, which one might expect, yet Grenzfurthner also immerses the film in politics, activism and social shifts. [...] Refreshingly devoid of the pretentiousness so often found amongst truly intellectual films, Traceroute is simultaneously a pretty wonderful personal journey and an immensely satisfying cinematic experience.\"\n\nThe film won \"Best Documentary Feature\" at the 2016 \"Phuture Con Festival\" (Denver, USA/Sapporo, Japan), won the \"Award of Merit\" for Documentary Feature at the 2016 \"Accolade Global Film Competition\", won the award for \"Best Documentary Feature Film\" at the 2016 \"Subversive Film Awards\" in Los Angeles, won the \"Award of Merit\" at \"The Indie Fest Awards\" in several categories (Documentary Feature, History / Biographical, Tourism / Travel, Contemporary Issues / Awareness Raising) and won a \"Honorable Mention\" at \"The Indie Gathering International Film Festival 2016\". It was nominated for the 2016 \"Austrian Documentary Award (ADA)\". The hackerspace \"Voidwarranties\" in Antwerp, Belgium awarded \"Traceroute\" the title of \"Nerd Movie Of The Year 2016\". Traceroute is a competition finalist at the 2016 \"Filmmatic Filmmaker Awards\". \"Diamond In The Rough Film Festival\" 2016 in Cupertino awarded Traceroute \"Best Feature Documentary\", \"Celludroid Film Festival 2016\" in Cape Town awarded the film \"Best Documentary\" and \"FrackFest\" 2016 in Oklahoma City gave Traceroute the \"Best of the Fest\" award and the \"Best Doc of the Fest\" Award. The film is also semi-finalist for the Golden Kapok Award at Guangzhou International Documentary Film Festival 2016. Johannes Grenzfurthner's editing was nominated for \"Best Editing\" at the 2017 Filmplus Festival, Cologne, Germany.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Film Threat's Chris Gore, Johannes Grenzfurthner debated the possibility of a sequel, a trip to destinations in Eastern Europe, with the goal to drive from Vienna to Baikonur Cosmodrome. Grenzfurthner changed the concept and created Glossary of Broken Dreams (2018), which he considers a loose sequel or follow-up.\n\n"}

{"id": "3001831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3001831", "title": "Verse novel", "text": "Verse novel\n\nA verse novel is a type of narrative poetry in which a novel-length narrative is told through the medium of poetry rather than prose. Either simple or complex stanzaic verse-forms may be used, but there will usually be a large cast, multiple voices, dialogue, narration, description, and action in a novelistic manner.\n\nVerse narratives are as old as the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", the \"Iliad\", and the \"Odyssey\", but the verse novel is a distinct modern form. Although the narrative structure is similar to that of a novella, the organisation of the story is usually in a series of short sections, often with changing perspectives. Verse novels are often told with multiple narrators, potentially providing readers with a cinematic view into the inner workings of the characters' minds. Some verse novels, following Byron's mock-heroic \"Don Juan\" (1818–24) employ an informal, colloquial register. \"Eugene Onegin\" (1831) by Alexander Pushkin is a classical example, and with \"Pan Tadeusz\" (1834) by Adam Mickiewicz is often taken as the seminal example of the modern genre.\n\nThe major nineteenth-century verse novels that ground the form in Anglophone letters include \"The Bothie of Toper-na-fuisich\" (1848) and \"Amours de Voyage\" (1858) by Arthur Hugh Clough, \"Aurora Leigh\" (1857) by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, \"Lucile\" (1860) by 'Owen Meredith' (Robert Bulwer-Lytton), and \"The Ring and the Book\" (1868-9) by Robert Browning. The form appears to have declined with Modernism, but has since the 1960s-70s undergone a remarkable revival. Vladimir Nabokov's \"Pale Fire\" (1962) takes the form of a 999-line poem four cantos, though the plot of the novel unfolds in the commentary. Of particular note, Vikram Seth's \"The Golden Gate\" (1986) was a surprise bestseller, and Derek Walcott's \"Omeros\" (1990) a more predictable success. The form has been particularly popular in the Caribbean, with work since 1980 by Walcott, Edward Kamau Brathwaite, David Dabydeen, Kwame Dawes, Ralph Thompson, George Elliott Clarke and Fred D'Aguiar, and in Australia and New Zealand, with work since 1990 by Les Murray, John Tranter, Dorothy Porter, Lisa Jacobson, Chris Orsman, David Foster, Alistair Te Ariki Campbell, and Robert Sullivan. Australian poet-author Alan Wearne's \"Night Markets\", and sequels, are major verse novels of urban social life and satire.\n\nThe Australian poet, C.J. Dennis, had great success in Australia during World War I with his verse novels, \"The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke\" (1915), and \"The Moods of Ginger Mick\" (1916). The first tells of an urban ruffian with a heart of gold who marries and becomes a father and a farmer in Melbourne, Australia, shortly before the start of World War I in 1914. The second is the story of another urban ruffian, and good friend of The Bloke, who enlists in the Australian Army, and dies in the early battles at Gallipoli in 1915.\n\nThe American author, poet, dramatist, screenwriter and suffragist and feminist, Alice Duer Miller published her verse novel, \"Forsaking All Others\" (1935), about a tragic love affair, and had a surprising hit with her verse novel, \"The White Cliffs\" (1940: later dramatised and filmed, but retaining and expanding the poems as voice-over narration, as \"The White Cliffs of Dover\" (1944). This told the story of a young American woman who goes to England in mid-1914, for a fortnight, falls in love with an American aristocrat, and marries him: he is killed in the last days of the First World War in 1918, and when World War II breaks out in 1939, she must decide whether or not to let her son join the army to fight for England. The story helped sway American sentiment towards helping the British, and was a best-seller! Miller’s poem-chapters were mainly traditional couplets, quatrains, and sonnets. They used several different voices, as well as letters from different characters.\n\nThe parallel history of the verse autobiography, from strong Victorian foundation with Wordsworth's \"The Prelude\" (1805, 1850), to decline with Modernism and later twentieth-century revival with John Betjeman's \"Summoned by Bells\" (1960), Walcott's \"Another Life\" (1973), and James Merrill's \"The Changing Light at Sandover\" (1982), is also striking. The forms are distinct, but many verse novels plainly deploy autobiographical elements, and the recent Commonwealth examples almost all offer detailed representation of the (problems besetting) post-imperial and post-colonial identity, and so are inevitably strongly personal works.\n\nThere is also a distinct cluster of verse novels for younger readers, most notably Karen Hesse's \"Out of the Dust\" (1997), which won a Newbery Medal. Hesse followed it with \"Witness\" (2001). Since then, many new titles have cropped up, with authors Sonya Sones, Ellen Hopkins, Steven Herrick, Margaret Wild, Nikki Grimes, Virginia Euwer Wolff, Ann Warren Turner, Lorie Ann Grover, Brenda Seabrooke, Paul B. Janeczko, and Mel Glenn all publishing multiple titles. Debut YA authors, Holly Thompson, Cathy Ostlere, Sarah Tregay, and others have added new titles to the shelves in 2011. Thanhha Lai's \"Inside Out & Back Again\" (2011) won the National Book Award.\n\nLong classical verse narratives were in stichic forms, prescribing a metre but not specifying any interlineal relations. This tradition is represented in English letters by the use of blank verse (unrhymed iambic pentameter), as by both Brownings and many later poets. But since Petrarch and Dante complex stanza forms have also been used for verse narratives, including \"terza rima\" (ABA BCB CDC etc.) and \"ottava rima\" (ABABABCC), and modern poets have experimented widely with adaptations and combinations of stanza-forms.\n\nThe stanza most specifically associated with the verse novel is the Onegin stanza, invented by Pushkin in \"Eugene Onegin\". It is an adapted form of the Shakespearean sonnet, retaining the three quatrains plus couplet structure but reducing the metre to iambic tetrameter and specifying a distinct rhyme scheme: the first quatrain is cross-rhymed (ABAB), the second couplet-rhymed (\"CCDD\"), and the third arch-rhymed (or chiasmic, EFFE), so that the whole is ABABCCDDEFFEGG. Additionally, Pushkin required that the first rhyme in each couplet (the A, C, and E rhymes) be unstressed (or \"feminine\"), and all others stressed (or \"masculine\"). In the rhyme scheme notation capitalizing masculine rhymes, this reads as }}. Not all those using the Onegin stanza have followed the prescription, but Vikram Seth notably did so, and the cadence of the unstressed rhymes is an important factor in his manipulations of tone.\n\n\n\n"}
