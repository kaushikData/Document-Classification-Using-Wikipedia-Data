{"id": "26584533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26584533", "title": "Arthur Mitchell (Dexter)", "text": "Arthur Mitchell (Dexter)\n\nArthur Mitchell, often referred to as the \"Trinity Killer\", is a fictional character in the Showtime TV series \"Dexter\". The character is portrayed by John Lithgow, who won a Golden Globe Award and a Primetime Emmy Award for his performance. He is the main antagonist in season four. In 2016, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him #34 of their \"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\".\n\nArthur Mitchell is portrayed as an unassuming suburbanite and family man — who for 30 years has been living a double life as a serial killer. In the series, FBI agent Frank Lundy dubs him the \"Trinity Killer\" because of a recurring pattern of three killings. The series shows that Mitchell's first murder is of a young woman in a bathtub, killed by slicing her femoral artery with a straight razor while putting her in a choke hold, and holding up a small mirror so that he can see her face as she dies. His second victim is a married mother of two, whom he kidnaps. He forces her, by threatening her husband and children if she does not comply, to fall to her death from a carefully selected abandoned building. His third victim is a father of two, whom he bludgeons to death with a hammer. At each site he places a small sample of his sister's ashes, and arranges the victim's arm to point at the ash. He has repeated this cycle in different cities all over the United States. Frank Lundy's superiors are skeptical about the existence of the Trinity Killer, leading him to launch a private inquiry into the murders that eluded him during his FBI career.\n\nIt is later discovered that, before these three, the Trinity Killer also kidnaps a young boy whom he dresses in cowboy pajamas and convinces to play with a train set in a recreation of his childhood. Following this, he will bury the boy alive in cement at a Four Walls' building site. These killings were not connected to the pattern until shortly before Mitchell's death, because the boys were reported as missing rather than dead.\n\nAt first, Dexter Morgan is fascinated by Mitchell's efficient killing methods and apparent ability to balance his familial responsibilities with his secret life as a serial killer.\n\nWhen Mitchell was 10, he innocently spied on his older sister taking a shower; when she saw him, she was so startled that she slipped and fell through the glass door, slicing her femoral artery and bleeding to death. His mother committed suicide two years later by jumping out of a window. His father blamed him for the tragedies that befell their family, and beat him for years until he was bludgeoned to death with a hammer (Dexter believes that Mitchell killed him). Mitchell re-enacts his family's deaths in his murders: the young woman represents his sister, the married mother of two represents his mother, the father of two represents his father, and the boy represents Mitchell himself.\n\nMitchell lives with his wife, Sally, and his teenaged children, Jonah and Rebecca. He has another, older daughter by a previous relationship: Christine Hill, who witnessed one of his murders as a child. He treats her like a shameful secret, forbidding her from contacting him and keeping her existence hidden from his other family. She tries unsuccessfully to win his love, going so far as to commit murder for him; she kills FBI agent Frank Lundy and wounds Dexter's adopted sister Debra to protect her father from the police. Her actions have the opposite of the intended effect, however: When he learns what she has done, Mitchell is enraged and tells her he wishes she had never been born. She commits suicide shortly afterward.\n\nIn season four, Mitchell begins the cycle again, killing his victims at the original murder sites. After killing the woman in the bathtub, Mitchell takes a shower in scalding hot water and, after forcing a mother to fall to her death, he provokes a drunken man into beating him up.\n\nFBI agent Frank Lundy comes out of retirement to hunt Trinity down, but is shot and killed just as he begins to close in on him. Lundy had theorized that Trinity was a loner who had no life outside killing. When Dexter goes to kill Trinity, he discovers that Trinity is a husband and father, as well as a prominent figure in a charitable Christian homebuilding organization. He uses this organization to travel around the country to cover for his murder spree, and (it is later learned) as a dump site for the first victim in his cycle.\n\nDexter is conflicted over whether to kill Mitchell or learn how he make his family life work. Dexter, under the alias of Kyle Butler, befriends Mitchell and soon learns that, unlike Dexter, Mitchell apparently has no problem being himself with his family or expressing affection. He also witnesses Mitchell's strange, unpredictable personality; the same man who murders people with uncommon brutality starts crying when he and Dexter hit a deer, and is appalled at the idea of putting it out of its misery.\n\nAs Mitchell plans a trip to Tampa to build a house, Dexter concocts a plan to go to a meteorological convention to establish an alibi so he has a reason to be in Tampa as well. Mitchell reluctantly allows Dexter to tag along when Dexter claims he's done something terrible that only Mitchell can help him recover from. Dexter, hoping to redeem his murder of an innocent man, plans to murder the decidedly guilty Mitchell along the way. During their road trip, however, Mitchell pushes Dexter to admit his terrible deed, and Dexter claims to have killed someone in a hunting accident. This admission greatly affects Mitchell, who sees it as a sign of kinship. He takes Dexter to his old home and tells him that when he was 10, he startled his sister while spying on her in the shower; she fell and broke the glass door, slicing her femoral artery and bleeding to death. His mother later committed suicide by leaping off a building, leaving him in the care of his abusive father; Dexter conjectures that Mitchell bludgeoned his father to death, accounting for the third victim.\n\nFor the remainder of the trip Mitchell exhibits sudden mood swings and irrational behavior. He keeps telling random people about his family members' deaths and stresses the need for confession, to the point that Dexter is actually worried that Mitchell might tell people about Dexter's previously mentioned murder. One morning, Dexter sneaks into Mitchell's room, intent on killing him, only to find him gone. Dexter tracks him to a construction site where Mitchell attempts suicide. Dexter reluctantly stops him, wanting to kill Mitchell himself. Dexter contemplates letting Mitchell fall to his death, but as he's about to let go, workers at the site come to help Dexter save him. Afterward, Mitchell has a newfound zest for life, believing God sent Dexter to save him.\n\nAs Dexter gets to know Mitchell, he learns that his would-be mentor is not the loving family man he appears to be; Mitchell dominates his wife, beats his son and keeps his daughter virtually imprisoned in her room. During Thanksgiving, Mitchell's son, Jonah, lashes out at his father, destroying his homebuilder's plaques and smashing his sister's urn. In a fit of rage, Mitchell almost strangles Jonah, but Dexter interferes, dragging him into the kitchen. Just as Dexter has Mitchell at his mercy, however, Mitchell's wife and daughter rush in to stop him.\n\nDexter witnesses Mitchell kidnap a child, but is unable to stop him. Eventually Dexter tracks him down as he's about to bury the boy alive in drying concrete. Dexter saves the boy, but Mitchell escapes. After Mitchell learns from a news report that the boy is alive, and that Dexter didn't turn him in, he begins to become suspicious. As he tries to find Dexter he kills a man named Kyle Butler, and ultimately follows Dexter to the Miami Metro Police Department. There, he discovers Dexter's real name.\n\nIn the last episode of the season, \"The Getaway\", Dexter subdues Mitchell and prepares to kill him in the room where Mitchell had held the kidnapped child. Mitchell believes Dexter was sent by God to kill him, and claims that he had tried several times to stop killing, but found that he could not change his \"path\". He predicts a similar fate for Dexter: he tells Dexter \"It's already over\", the same thing he says to his victims before he kills them. Dexter then kills him with a hammer. It is revealed in the final scene of the episode that Mitchell killed Dexter's wife, Rita, in the bathtub of Dexter's house, and that he left Dexter's son Harrison in her blood, mirroring the childhood trauma that put Dexter on the path to becoming a serial killer.\n\nMiami Metro detective Joey Quinn suspects Dexter of killing Rita, and he connects the dots as for the identity of Kyle Butler. Anxious to further his investigation, Quinn requests permission from Captain Maria LaGuerta, but she denies his request and orders him to leave Dexter alone. Undeterred, Quinn finds Jonah Mitchell amidst being relocated into witness protection with the rest of his family, and tries to show him a picture of Dexter so that Jonah can confirm whether or not it is \"Kyle Butler\". However, one of the FBI convoys manages to intercept Quinn's attempt before he succeeds, and so Quinn's query remains unanswered.\n\nIn the sixth season, Dexter hears news about the Mitchell family, who are now living in Nebraska: Mitchell's wife, Sally, and daughter, Rebecca, have been murdered in the same way as were Mitchell's victims. Dexter deduces that Jonah is the killer, and hunts him down. At first, Jonah claims his father killed them both, but later gets into a fight with Dexter, seemingly wanting to die by Dexter's hand. Confused, Dexter gets Jonah to confess that Rebecca actually committed suicide because their mother kept blaming the children for Mitchell's capture; upon finding her, Jonah flew into a fit of rage and killed his mother, bludgeoning her in the same manner that his father killed his victims. Dexter tells Jonah to forgive himself, and leaves.\n"}
{"id": "14979701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14979701", "title": "Barasana", "text": "Barasana\n\nBarasana (alternate names \"Barazana\", Panenua\", \"Pareroa\", or \"Taiwano is an exonym applied to an Amazonian people, considered distinct from the Taiwano, though the dialect of the latter is almost identical to that of the Barasana, and outside observers can detect only minute differences between the two languages. They are a Tucanoan group located in the eastern part of the Amazon Basin in Vaupés Department in Colombia and Amazonas State in Brazil. As of 2000 there were at least 500 Barasanas in Colombia, though some recent estimates place the figure as high as 1950. A further 40 live on the Brazilian side, in the municipalities of Japurá and São Gabriel da Cachoeira.\n\nThe Barasana refers to themselves as the \"jebá.~baca\", or people of the jaguar (\"Jebá\" \"jaguar\" is their mythical ancestor).\n\nBarasana territory lies in the central sector of the Colombian Northwest Amazon. The Barasana inhabit the Pirá-piraná river basin of the Comiseria de Vaupés between the two main river systems of the Vaupés River and the Japurá River . The area is a tropical rainforest, interspersed with occasional stands of Mauritia flexuosa or mirití palm and savanna with xerophytic vegetation. Rainfall averages around per year.\n\nIts climate is marked by four seasons, a long dry spell from December to March followed by the wet season from March to August, a short dry season between August and September, followed by a rainy season from September until December. The average temperature varies between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius (68 and 86 °F). It is notorious for its treacherous rivers that are choked with dangerous rapids and falls. The number of faunal species is not rich, and individual animals not common, though hunting game is prized as the fundamentally male mode of procuring food. Fish also, despite the many rivers, do not abound.\n\nThe Vaupés area is inhabited by roughly 20 tribes or descent groups. The word tribe is generally disdained by anthropologists, who prefer to define groups by such terms as sib, language group, exogamous group or phratry., living in an unbounded system, that is cosmopolitan and multilingual. Apart from the Maku and the Arawakan, Vaupés Indians belong to Eastern Tukanoan language family, most prominent of them being, other than the Barasana, the Desana, the Bará, the Tukano proper, the Macuna, the Tatuyo, and the Cubeo. Despite the established system of intermarriage, their languages are mutually unintelligible. A Creole-type lingua franca, called locally lingua geral, created by the Jesuit missionaries as a general language for communicating with Indians in the lower reaches of the Amazon, is also spoken among them.\n\nThe various Tukanoan myths of origin refer to a westward upstream migration from Brazil, and Reichel-Dolmatoff believes that there is a ‘kernel of historical truth’ behind these uniform traditions. Curt Nimuendajú thought that the east Tukanoan tribes invaded from the west, and that the autochthonous population consisted of the Makú, assuming that these smaller hunter-gatherers were older than the agriculturalist newcomers. Desultory Spanish contact with the Vaupés region goes back to the 16th century. But historical records show that the Tukano peoples shifted to the remote headwaters of the Río Negro as a refuge, in flight from the slave trade and diseases, and forced relocations introduced by the Portuguese in the late 18th.century. It was Alfred Russel Wallace, in travelling up the Vaupés river in 1850 who first took note of Indians like the Barasana and their dialects. and the rites of their Yurupary cult. According to his account, traders were already active in the area. Catholic and Protestant missionaries entered the area in the last decades of the 19th century. One major reaction to this evangelisation in the Vaupés, initiated by Venancio Aniseto Kamiko, was to create a wave of messianic cults among the tribes. Missionaries were convinced that the central cult of Yurupary, their culture hero, was the work of the Devil, though this was a series of rituals rather than a divinity. The result was widespread damage to the native culture. as ceremonial houses were burnt, ritual ornaments destroyed, and secret masks displayed to the tribe’s women and children, who were previously forbidden to look at them. Messianic shamanism, strongly connected with jaguar shamanism, declined further with the establishment of Catholic missions in the first decades of the 20th century. The German traveller Theodor Koch-Grünberg spent two years at the turn of the century (1903–05) travelling throughout the region and provided a classic account of the Indians’ material culture and languages, which long remained the authoritative source for information of these tribes. Rubber-gatherers from the beginning of the 20th century began to aggressively exploit the area, as they did again the World War II when the urgency of improved rubber supplies led to a rubber boom in the area. Their violent presence caused considerable upheaval and suffering, finally driving the Indians, after fierce resistance, into the less accessible backwaters. Population decline, as a result, has been a marked feature of the past one hundred and fifty years, The earliest professional ethnological fieldwork was done by Irving Goldman in 1939-40 among the Cubeo Indians. Postwar missionary work, colonizing movements, and the activities of the linguists attached to Christian proseyltisation still engage, according to Stephen Hugh-Jones, in the ‘criminal folly’ of ethnocide by their programmatic hostility to traditional religion\n\nThe Barasana are slash-and-burn swidden horticulturalists who supplement their food with hunting and fish-gathering, with different roles allocated to men (poisoners) and women (gatherers of the poisoned catch). The economy is inelastic, subsistence-oriented and egalitarian. As both hunter-gatherers, and gardeners, the Barasana exploit the forest in various ways to obtain a wide variety of foodstuffs. Bread made of bitter cassava is their staple food; Barasana culture itself is said to be grounded on cultivation of cassava production. but they also harvest maize, bananas, cooking plantains, yams, sweet potatoes, pineapples, sugarcane and considerable quantities of fruits picked in the forests or from cultivated trees like the Pithecellobium dulce, the \"Madras thorn\" or \"mene\". Fishing supplies most of the protein in their diet, supplemented by game, rodents and birds mostly, but woolly monkeys and peccaries are also culled, traditionally with blowguns, but most recently also with shotguns. Unlike most South American peoples, the Barasana are not particularly passionate about honey, which they gather occasionally. Beeswax, on the other hand, is highly prized for its use in ceremonial contexts. From cassava leaves they extract a native chicha. Coca and tobacco, the latter prepared either in cigars or as snuff, are also cultivated. They prepare their local entheogenic drink ayahuasca, which they call \"yagé\", from the endemic Banisteriopsis caapi, a liana locally known as \"vine of the soul\" or \"vine of the ancestors\".\n\nThe Tukunoan descent groups are subdivided into ranked and named sibs. The dominant feature of their social organization is language group exogamy, which requires that one must always marry a spouse speaking a language different from one’s own. Among the Barasana themselves, exceptions however do exist to the principle of linguistic exogamy, since they intermarry with Taiwanos whose language is regarded as almost identical to their own. This means that one’s father’s language determines one’s inclusion or exclusion in Barasana identity, which accounts for the custom of virilocality. Women marrying out, though speaking Barasana as their native tongue, are therefore excluded from Barasana identity. Concern for exogamy is obsessive and is considered by Reichel-Dolmstoff to be the most important social rule of all.\n\nThe Vaupés social system may be divided in four units in ascending hierarchy, namely (a) the local descent group, (2) the sib, (3) the language-aggregate, and finally (4) the phratry. Kinship is based on a ‘a Dravidian’ type sib system, with bilateral cross-cousin marriage between people from hierarchically order patrilineal sibs.\nLike most other groups of the Vaupés system, the Barasana are an exogamous patrilineal and patrilocal descent group, with a segmentary social structure. The constitutive groups live in isolated settlements in units of four to eight families dwelling in multifamily longhouses.\n\nThe Barasana have seven exogamous phratries, and five sibs, common descendants of the \"Yebi Meni\" Anaconda people, traditionally ranked hierarchically in decreasing order of seniority, with each assigned a distinct ritual role as (1) \"Koamona\", ritual chiefs (2) \"Rasegana\", dancers and chanters (3) \"Meni Masa\", warriors (4) \"Daria\", shamans and (5) \"Wabea\", cigar lighters. These ritual functions restricted to distinct sibs, reflect a dying tradition, and survive now mainly as a matter of ideology. Barasana society is rigidly divided along sexual lines. Men and women enter dwellings by different doors, pass most of their lives in separation, a reality reinforced by their ceremonial Yurupari rites. Yet in Vaupés societies women have higher status, and marriages are more stable than in other South Amerindian groups, perhaps since intertribal warfare ended several decades ago, which may explain why women are not ‘pawns in the displays of male brinksmanship.’ \n\nBarasana is classified as one of the eastern Tucanoan languages. It is mutually intelligible with Taiwano, and both are considered dialect variations of each other, though it is reported that Taiwano speakers are assimilating to the Barasana with whom they have very close relations of exchange, leading them to adopt the Barasana tongue.\n\n"}
{"id": "1335219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1335219", "title": "Batak", "text": "Batak\n\nBatak is a collective term used to identify a number of closely related Austronesian ethnic groups predominantly found in North Sumatra, Indonesia who speak Batak languages. The term is used to include the Karo, Pakpak, Simalungun, Toba, Angkola, and Mandailing which are related groups with distinct languages and customs (\"adat\").\n\nLinguistic and archaeological evidence indicates that Austronesian speakers first reached Sumatra from Taiwan and the Philippines through Borneo or Java about 2,500 years ago, and the Batak probably descended from these settlers. While the archaeology of southern Sumatra testifies to the existence of neolithic settlers, it seems that the northern part of Sumatra was settled by agriculturalists at a considerably later stage.\n\nAlthough the Batak are often considered to be isolated peoples thanks to their location inland, away from the influence of seafaring European colonials, there is evidence that they have been involved in trade with other neighbouring kingdoms for a millennium or more.\n\nThe Bataks practiced a syncretic religion of Tamil Shaivism, Buddhism and local culture for thousands of years. The last Batak king who fought valiantly against Dutch imperialists till 1905 was an Indonesian Shaivite king. The Batak may be mentioned in Zhao Rugua's 13th-century \"Description of the Barbarous People\", which refers to a 'Ba-ta' dependency of Srivijaya. The \"Suma Oriental\", of the 15th century, also refers to the kingdom of Bata, bounded by Pasai and the Aru kingdom.\n\nBased on this evidence, the Batak may have been involved in procuring important commodities for trade with China, perhaps from the 8th or 9th centuries and continuing for the next thousand years, with Batak men carrying the products on their backs for sale at ports.\n\nIt has been suggested that the important port of Barus in Tapanuli was populated primarily by Batak people. A Tamil inscription has been found in Barus which is dated to 1088, while contact with Chinese and Tamil traders took place at Kota Cina, a trading town located in what is now northern Medan that was established in the 11th century, and comprising 10,000 people by the 12th century. Tamil remains have been found on key trade routes to the Batak lands.\n\nThese trading opportunities may have caused migration of Batak from Pakpak and Toba to the present-day Karo and Simalungun 'frontier' lands, where they were exposed to greater influence from visiting Tamil traders, while the migration of Batak to the Angkola-Mandailing lands may have been prompted by 8th-century Srivijayan demand for camphor.\n\nThe Karo \"marga\" or tribe \"Sembiring\" \"black one\" is believed to originate from their ties with Tamil traders, with specific Sembiring sub-marga, namely Brahmana, Colia, Pandia, Depari, Meliala, Muham, Pelawi, and Tekan all of Indian origin. Tamil influence on Karo religious practices are also noted, with the pekualuh secondary cremation ritual being specific to the Karo and Dairi people. Moreover the Pustaka Kembaren, an origin story of the Sembiring Kembaren suggests linkages with Pagarruyung in Minangkabau Highlands.\n\nFrom the 16th century onward, Aceh increased the production of pepper, an important export commodity, in exchange for rice, which grew well in the Batak wetlands. Batak people in different areas cultivated either \"sawah\" (wet rice fields) or \"ladang\" (dry rice), and the Toba Batak, most expert in agriculture, must have migrated to meet demand in new areas. The increasing importance of rice had religious significance, which increased the power of the Batak high priests, who had responsibility for ensuring agricultural success.\n\nThe Batak speak a variety of closely related languages, all members of the Austronesian language family. There are two major branches, a northern branch comprising the Pakpak-Dairi, Alas-Kluet and Karo languages, which are similar to each other, and a distinct southern branch, comprising three mutually intelligible dialects: Toba, Angkola and Mandailing. Simalungun is an early offspring of the southern branch. Some Simalungun dialects can be understood by speakers of Batak Karo, whereas other dialects of Simalungun can be understood by speakers of Toba. This is due to the existence of a linguistic continuum that often blurs the lines between the Batak dialects. Batak dialect still influences the dialects in Medan city today.\n\nThe Batak possess their own script known as the \"Surat Batak\". The writing has chiefly ceremonial importance within traditional religious ceremonies, and was subject to little change for this reason. It is likely that the Batak people originally received their writing system from southern Sumatra.\n\nThe traditional occupation of the Batak was agriculture, hunting and farming. The great lake of Toba provided vast opportunity for freshwater aquaculture since ancient times. Interior rural Batak communities relied heavily on rice farming, horticulture and other plant and commercial crops, and to some extent, acquiring forest products, such as hard wood, plant resin, and wild animals. \n\nThe port of Barus on the western coast of Batak lands has become famous as the source of \"kapur barus\" (camphor). In ancient times, Batak warriors were often recruited by neighboring Malay courts as mercenaries. In the colonial era, the Dutch introduced commercial cash crops, such as coffee, \"sawit\" palm oil, and rubber, converting some parts of the Batak land into plantations.\n\nThroughout the history of modern Indonesia, the Batak community has been a significant contributor. Batak people have filled a wide range of occupations, from running modest tire service workshops to serving as state ministers. The modern Batak have gravitated towards professions such as attorneys, bus and taxi drivers, mechanics, engineers, singers and musicians, writers and journalists, teachers, economists, scientists, and military officers.\n\nEven though the Batak are a minority among the Indonesian population (3.58 %; only 8-9 million Batak people out of 236 million according 2010's census), there have been a number of notable Batak that have risen to distinguished positions and careers. Especially in the field of law Bataks have been well represented. Among others, lawyers like Hotma Sitompul, Ruhut Sitompul and Hotman Paris Hutapea are widely known beyond the circle of their legal colleagues, since they have gained star lawyer reputations by handling high-profile cases closely reported by the media. One of the most influential attorneys in Indonesian legal history was Prof. Dr. Adnan Buyung Nasution who struggled in the autocratic Suharto era with great personal risk and engagement for democratic values and the rule of law. \n\nHe founded successfully with other prominent Batak lawyers like Albert Hasibuan, Victor D. Sibarani and Todung Mulya Lubis the first Indonesian human rights organization YLBH (Legal Aid Indonesia). Besides that, Batak people have also shaped Indonesian society in the sense of cultural development: Musicians like and Donnie Sibarani, the writer Mochtar Lubis and painter are fine examples for a profound involvement in the area of Indonesian arts. National heroes such as Sisingamangaraja XII, two Indonesian prime ministers (Amir Syarifuddin Harahap and Burhanuddin Harahap), speakers of the parliament (Zainul Arifin Pohan), one vice president (Adam Malik Batubara), governor of the central bank (Darmin Nasution), one attorney general (Marsillam Simanjuntak), and many cabinet ministers (such as M.S. Kaban, Tifatul Sembiring, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan), as well as leading military generals and officers (Abdul Harris Nasution, T. B. Simatupang, Maraden Panggabean) are also showing their influence in Indonesian life, history and politics.\n\nBatak societies are patriarchally organized along clans known as \"Marga\". A traditional belief among the Toba Batak is that they originate from one ancestor \"Si Raja Batak\", with all \"Margas\" descended from him. A family tree that defines the father-son relationship among Batak people is called \"tarombo\". In contemporary Indonesia, the Batak people have a strong focus on education and a prominent position in the professions, particularly as teachers, engineers, doctors and lawyers. Toba Batak are known traditionally for their weaving, wood carving and especially ornate stone tombs.\n\nBefore they became subjects of the colonial Dutch East Indies government, the Batak had a reputation for being fierce warriors. Today the Batak are mostly Christian with a Muslim minority. Currently the largest Christian congregation in Indonesia is the HKBP (\"Huria Kristen Batak Protestan\") Christian church. The dominant Christian theology was brought by Lutheran German missionaries in the 19th century, including the well-known missionary Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen. Christianity was introduced to the Karo by Dutch Calvinist missionaries, and their largest church is the GBKP (\"Gereja Batak Karo Protestan\"). The Mandailing and Angkola Batak were converted to Islam in the early 19th century during the reign of Minangkabaus Padri. A significant minority of Batak people do not adhere to either Christianity or Islam, however, and follow traditional practices known as the \"agama si dekah\", the old religion, which is also called \"perbegu\" or \"pemena\".\n\n\"Dalihan Na Tolu\" (three-legged furnace) is the philosophy of life of the Batak people. It was consisted of three general rule in Batak society. Those are:\nThe essence of this teachings is the moral code contains the teachings of mutual respect (\"masipasangapon\") with the support of the moral rule: mutual respect and helpfulness.\n\nRitual cannibalism was well documented among pre-colonial Batak people, being performed in order to strengthen the eater's \"tendi\". In particular, the blood, heart, palms and soles of the feet were seen as rich in \"tendi\".\n\nIn Marco Polo’s memoirs of his stay on the east coast of Sumatra (then called Java Minor) from April to September 1292, he mentions an encounter with hill folk whom he refers to as “man-eaters”. From secondary sources, Marco Polo recorded stories of ritual cannibalism among the \"Battas\". Marco Polo's stay was restricted to the coastal areas, and he never ventured inland to directly verify such claims. Despite never personally witnessing these events, he was nonetheless willing to pass on descriptions which were provided to him, in which a condemned man was eaten: \"They suffocate him. And when he is dead they have him cooked, and gather together all the dead man's kin, and eat him. And I assure you they do suck the very bones till not a particle of marrow remains in them...And so they eat him up stump and rump. And when they have thus eaten him they collect his bones and put them in fine chests, and carry them away, and place them in caverns among the mountains where no beast nor other creature can get at them. And you must know also that if they take prisoner a man of another country, and he cannot pay a ransom in coin, they kill him and eat him straightway.\n\nThe Venetian Niccolò de' Conti (1395–1469) spent most of 1421 in Sumatra in the course of a long trading journey to Southeast Asia (1414–1439), and wrote a brief description of the inhabitants: \"In a part of the island called Batech live cannibals who wage continual war on their neighbors.\"\n\nSir Thomas Stamford Raffles in the 1820s studied the Batak and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act as well as their methods. Raffles stated that \"It is usual for the people to eat their parents when too old to work,\" and that for certain crimes a criminal would be eaten alive: “The flesh is eaten raw or grilled, with lime, salt and a little rice.”\n\nThe German physician and geographer Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn visited the Batak lands in 1840-41. Junghuhn says about cannibalism among the Batak (whom he called \"Battaer\"): \n“People do the honest Battaer an injustice when it is said that they sell human flesh in the markets, and that they slaughter their old people as soon as they are unfit for work...They eat human flesh only in wartime, when they are enraged, and in a few legal instances.”\nJunghuhn tells how after a perilous and hungry flight he arrived in a friendly village, and the food that was offered by his hosts was the flesh of two prisoners who had been slaughtered the day before, however he maintains that the Batak exaggerated their love of human flesh in order to frighten off would-be invaders and to gain occasional employment as mercenaries for the coastal tribes who were plagued by pirates.\n\nOscar von Kessel visited Silindung in the 1840s and in 1844 was probably the first European to observe a Batak cannibalistic ritual in which a convicted adulterer was eaten alive. His description parallels that of Marsden in some important respects, however von Kessel states that cannibalism was regarded by the Batak as a judicial act and its application was restricted to very narrowly defined infringements of the law including theft, adultery, spying or treason. Salt, red pepper and lemons had to be provided by the relatives of the victim as a sign that they accepted the verdict of the community and were not thinking of revenge.\n\nIda Laura Pfeiffer visited the Batak in August 1852 and although she did not observe any cannibalism, she was told that: \n\nSamuel Munson and Henry Lyman, American Baptist missionaries to the Batak, were cannibalized in 1834. Dutch and German missionaries to the Batak in the late 19th century observed a few instances of cannibalism and wrote lurid descriptions to their home parishes in order to raise donations for further missions. The growing Dutch influence in northern Sumatra led to increased Malay influence in coastal trade and plantations, pushing the Karo farther inland. Growing ethnic tensions culminated in the 1872 Karo Rebellion where the Karo were suppressed by Dutch and Malay forces. Despite this, Karo resistance to Dutch imperialism lingered into the early 20th century. In 1890 the Dutch colonial government banned cannibalism in the regions under their control. Rumors of Batak cannibalism survived into the early 20th century but it seems probable that the custom was rare after 1816, due partially to the influence of Islam.\n\nFamily tree or lineage is a very important thing for the Batak. For those who do not know the lineage will be considered as a strayed (\"nalilu\") Batak. Batak people are required to know their lineage or at least the ancestors of which the family name (Marga (Batak)) and the related clans (\"dongan tubu\") came from. This is necessary in order to determine the relation of a kinship (\"partuturanna\") within a clan or simply the surname (Marga (Batak)) itself.\n\nThe Batak lands consist of North Sumatra province, excluding Nias island, the historically Malay kingdoms of the east coast and the western coast of Minangkabau people. In addition, part of the Karo lands extend into modern-day East Aceh Regency in Aceh province, while parts of the Mandailing lands lie in Rokan Hulu Regency in Riau. Significant numbers of Batak have migrated in recent years to prosperous neighbouring Riau province.\n\nTo the south of North Sumatra are the Muslim Minangkabau of West Sumatra, while to the north there are various Muslim Acehnese peoples.\n\nThe various Batak cultures differ in their pre-colonial religious ideas as they do in many other aspects of culture. Information about the old religious ideas of the Mandailing and Angkola in southern Batakland is incomplete, and very little is known about the religion of the Pakpak and Simalungun Batak. For the Toba and Karo on the other hand the evidence in the writings of missionaries and colonial administrators is relatively abundant. Information on the traditional forms of Batak religion is derived mainly from the writings of German and Dutch missionaries who became increasingly concerned with Batak beliefs towards the end of the 19th century.\n\nVarious influences affected the Batak through their contact with Tamil and Javanese traders and settlers in southern Batakland, and the east and west coast near Barus and Tapanuli, in particular the large Padang Lawas temple complex in Tapanuli. These contacts took place many centuries ago and it is impossible to reconstruct just how far the religious ideas of these foreigners were adopted and reworked by the Batak. It is suggested that the Batak adopted aspects of these religions, specifically Mahayana Buddhist, Shaivist, and Tantrist practices within their own customs.\n\nThe modern Indonesian state is founded on the principles of pancasila, which requires the belief in 'one and only God', the practice of either Protestantism, Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism or Hinduism, one of which must be entered on an individual's KTP. Traditional religions are not officially recognised, and accordingly traditional religions are increasingly marginalised, although aspects of the traditional Batak religion are still practised alongside Christianity.\n\nThere are many different versions in circulation. These were formerly passed down through oral tradition but have now been written down in the local languages. There are also large collections of Batak tales collected by European scholars since the mid-19th century and recorded in European languages, mostly Dutch.\n\nAt the beginning of time there was only the sky with a great sea beneath it. In the sky lived the gods and the sea was the home of a mighty underworld dragon \"Naga Padoha\". The earth did not yet exist and human beings, too, were as yet unknown. All the surviving myths record that at the beginning of creation stands the god \"Mula Jadi Na Bolon\". His origin remains uncertain. A rough translation of the name is the \"beginning of becoming\". The creation of everything that exists can be traced back to him. \"Mula Jadi\" lives in the upper world which is usually thought of as divided into seven levels. His three sons, \"Batara Guru\", \"Mangalabulan\" and \"Soripada\" were born from eggs laid by a hen fertilized by \"Mula Jadi\". Two swallows act as messengers and helpers to \"Mula Jadi\" in his act of creation. Their functions vary in the different versions. \"Mula Jadi\" begets three daughters whom he gives as wives for his three sons. Mankind is the result of the union of the three couples. Besides the three sons of \"Mula Jadi\" there is another god, \"Asiasi\", whose place and function in the world of the gods remains largely unclear. There is some evidence that \"Asiasi\" can be seen as the balance and unity of the trinity of gods.\n\nThe ruler of the underworld, i. e. the primeval sea, is the serpent-dragon \"Naga Padoha\". He too existed before the beginning and seems to be the opponent of \"Mula Jadi\". As ruler of the underworld \"Naga Padoha\" also has an important function in the creation of the earth.\n\nWhat all the six gods so far mentioned have in common is that they play a minor role in ritual. They do not receive any sacrificial offerings from the faithful and no places of sacrifice are built for them. They are merely called on in prayers for help and assistance.\n\nThe origin of the earth and of mankind is connected mainly with the daughter of \"Batara Guru\", \"Sideak Parujar\", who is the actual creator of the earth. She flees from her intended husband,\nthe lizard-shaped son of \"Mangalabulan\", and lets herself down on a spun thread from the sky to the middle world which at that time was still just a watery waste. She refuses to go back but feels very unhappy. Out of compassion \"Mula Jadi\" sends his granddaughter a handful of earth so that she can find somewhere to live. \"Sideak Parudjar\" was ordered to spread out this earth and thus the earth became broad and long. But the goddess was not able to enjoy her rest for long. The earth had been spread out on the head of \"Naga Padoha\", the dragon of the underworld who lived in the water. He groaned under the weight and attempted to get rid of it by rolling around. The earth was softened by water and threatened to be utterly destroyed. With the help of \"Mula Jadi\" and by her own cunning \"Sideak Parudjar\" was able to overcome the dragon. She thrust a sword into the body of \"Naga Padoha\" up to the hilt and laid him in an iron block. Whenever \"Naga Padoha\" twists in the fetters an earthquake occurs.\n\nAfter the lizard-shaped son of \"Mangalabulan\", the husband the gods intended for her, had taken another name and another form, \"Sideak Parujar\" marries him. \"Sideak Parujar\" becomes the mother of twins of different sexes. When the two have grown up their divine parents return to the upper world leaving the couple behind on the earth. Mankind is the result of their incestuous union.\nThe couple settle on Pusuk Buhit, a volcano on the western shore of Lake Toba, and found the village of Si Anjur Mulamula. The mythological ancestor of the Batak, \"Si Raja Batak\" is one of their grandchildren.\n\nIn the religious world of the Toba and Karo Batak the gods and the creation of mankind are far less significant than the complex concepts connected with the \"tendi\" (Karo) or \"tondi\" (Toba) and the \"begu\". Probably the most useful translations of these terms are \"life-soul\" and \"death-soul\". A person receives his \"life-soul\" (\"tendi\") from \"Mula Jadi Na Bolon\" before he is born. The destiny of the individual \"tendi\" is decided by the \"tendi\" itself before birth. Various myths are woven around manner in which the \"tendi\" choose their destiny from \"Mula Jadi\". Warneck, a missionary and for a long time superintendent (\"ephorus\") of the Batak Church, recorded two particularly expressive myths in his major work on Batak religion. What is significant is that the \"tendi\" themselves are responsible for their idiocy:\n\nAmong the Karo and the Toba there are sometimes widely diverging versions of where the \"tendi\" dwells and how many \"tendi\" there are. According to the Toba a person has seven \"tendi\". The second \"tendi\" is found in the placenta and amniotic fluid of the new-born baby, and accordingly the afterbirth is given special attention after the birth of a child. It is usually buried under the house, is called \"saudara\" (brother) and is regarded as the person's guardian spirit. Similar ideas about the afterbirth are also found among the Karo, who also bury the placenta and amniotic fluid under the house and regard them as two guardian spirits (\"kaka\" and \"agi\") who always remain close to the person.\n\nAll Batak regard the loss of \"tendi\" as signifying a great danger for \"body and soul\". \"Tendi\" can be separated from their owners through inattentiveness, or as a result of black magic by a \"datu\" with evil intentions. In other words, the \"tendi\" is not tied to the body; it can also live for a time outside the body. The final loss of the \"tendi\" inevitably results in death. There are a variety of ideas about where exactly in the body the \"tendi\" dwells. It is present to a particularly high degree in certain parts of the body, especially the blood, the liver, the head and the heart. Sweat too is described as rich in \"tendi\". It is believed that illnesses are connected with the absence of \"tendi\", and the bringing back of the \"tendi\" is a main method of healing. The Karo, for instance, have gifts, called \"upah tendi\" (\"upah\" = wage, payment, gift), which they give to their \"tendi\" so that their \"tendi\" stay with them. These gifts may consist of a knife, a gong, a particular piece of clothing, a water buffalo or a small holy place. The gifts are carefully cared for in order to keep the \"tendi\" satisfied.\n\n\"Tendi\" love the sound of the \"surdam\" (a bamboo flute). If a \"tendi\" has abandoned the body of a patient, the playing of the \"surdam\" in the \"raleng tendi\" ritual can contribute to the \"tendi\" returning to the body of the sick person. It must be emphasized that only the \"datuk\" are in a position to interpret and influence people's \"tendi\" correctly. If their endeavors are unsuccessful, then clearly the \"tendi\" has chosen another destiny for itself.\n\nAt death the \"tendi\" leaves the human body through the fontanelle and the \"death-soul\" (\"begu\") is set free. It is thought that the \"tendi\" vanishes and after the death of any human being only the \"begu\" continues to exist. The Batak believe that the \"begu\" continue to live near their previous dwelling (in a village of the dead which is thought to be situated not far from the\ncemetery) and that they may contact their descendants. Bad dreams, particular misfortune and such like may be signs that the \"begu\" of an ancestor is not satisfied with the behavior of its descendants. Any individual can attempt to pacify an enraged \"begu\" by means of food and drink offerings and prayers. If this does not work, a \"datu\" or a \"guru\" must be called in. The \"begu\" are not immortal, since death also rules in the land of the dead: a \"begu\" dies seven times before it is changed into a straw and finally becomes earth.\n\nThe Batak believe that three categories of \"begu\" exist. The \"bicara guru\" are the \"begu\" of stillborn babies or of babies who have died before teething. It is possible to turn \"bicara guru\" into guardian spirits if misfortune has befallen the family of the child shortly after its death. With the help of a \"guru sibaso\", the \"bicara guru\" can be made the family's guardian spirit for which a shrine is provided and to which sacrifices are regularly made. Once a year the \"bicara guru\" is accorded a special feast, preceded by ritual hair washing.\n\nThe \"begu\" of members of the family who have had a sudden death (\"mate sada-uari\") can also act as guardian spirits for the family. They include the victims of accidents, suicides, murder victims, or people struck by lightning. A shrine is built where they are venerated and where sacrifices are made. A third category consists of the \"begu\" of dead virgins (\"tungkup\"). Their graves, called \"bata-bata\" or \"ingan tungkup\", are maintained for a long time by their relatives.\n\nBatak burial traditions are very rich and complex. Immediately after death various ritual actions are performed to make the \"begu\" understand that from now on its world is separate from that of its kin. Symbolically this is done by reversing the mat on which the corpse is laid out so that the body lies with its head at the foot of the mat. Thumbs and toes respectively are tied together and the body is rubbed all over with camphor and its orifices stopped with camphor, then it is wrapped in a white cotton cloth. During this \"perumah begu\" ceremony a \"guru sibaso\" declares to the \"begu\" of the deceased that it is definitely dead and must take leave of its relatives.\n\nWealthier families have their coffins (Karo: \"pelangkah\") made of the wood of the \"\" tree (\"Ateurites rnoluccana\"), carved in the shape of a boat, its bow decorated with the carved head of a hornbill, or a horse, or a mythical beast known as a singa. The lid is then sealed with resin and the coffin may be placed in a special location near the family's house until a reburial ceremony can take place. Families that are not wealthy use simple wooden coffins or wrap the body in a straw mat.\n\nThe corpse is carried a few times round the house, usually by women, and then to the cemetery with musical accompaniment from the \"gondang\" orchestra and the continual firing of guns. At any crossroads the corpse is put down and eleven people go around it four times to confuse the \"begu\". It is hoped that the \"begu\" will then be unable to find its way back to the village. When the funeral procession arrives at the cemetery the grave is dug and the corpse laid in it, flat on its back. Care is taken that the head lies towards the village so that, in the unexpected event that the body should get up, he or she will not be looking in the direction of the village. The bodies of \"datuk\" and those who have died from lightning are buried sitting up with their hands tied together. The palms of the hand are tied together and betel placed between them.\n\nThe burial tradition includes a reburial ceremony in which the bones of one's ancestors are reinterred several years after death. This secondary burial is known among the Toba Batak as \"mangongkal holi\", among the Karo as \"nurun-nurun\". In a ceremony lasting several days the bones of a particularly honored ancestor and those of his descendants are exhumed, cleaned, mourned and finally laid to rest again in a bone house known as a \"tugu\" or \"tambak\":\n\nIn ancient times these sarcophagi were carved from stone or constructed from wood and later brick. Nowadays they are made of cement or concrete. Large and very ornate \"tugu\" can be seen around Lake Toba and on the island of Samosir.\n\nOne motive for the reburial ceremony appears to be to raise the status of the \"begu\" of the deceased. Traditional Batak beliefs hold that the dead occupy a hierarchical status similar to the social position they held in life. This means that a rich and powerful individual remains influential after death, and this status can be elevated if the family holds a reburial ceremony. A rich descendant can advance a \"begu\" to the status of a \"sumangot\" by means of a great ceremony and a \"horja\" feast which can last up to seven days. In antiquity a vast number of pigs, cattle or even buffalo were slaughtered at such festivals, and the \"gondang\" orchestra provided an accompaniment.\n\nThe next level up from the \"sumangot\" is the \"sombaon\", who are the spirits of important ancestors who lived ten to twelve generations ago. To raise a \"sumangot\" to a \"sombaon\" requires another great festival, a \"santi rea\", often lasting several months, during which the inhabitants of the whole district come together. These powerful ancestor spirits offer protection and good fortune to their descendants, but the ceremony also serves to establish new kinship groups descended from the ancestor thus honored.\n\nIn traditional Batak society \"datuk\" (animist priests) as well as \"gurus\" practiced traditional medicine, although the former were exclusively male. Both professions were attributed with supernatural powers and the ability to predict the future. Treatments and healing rituals bear some resemblance to those practiced by dukuns in other parts of Indonesia. Following the Christianization of the Toba and Karo Batak in the late 19th century, missionaries discouraged traditional healing and divination and they became largely clandestine activities.\n\nBoth \"datu\" and \"guru\" healers also practiced divination by consulting a \"pustaha\", a handwritten book made of wood and bark in which were inscribed recipes for healing remedies, incantations and songs, predictive calendars, and other notes on magic, healing and divination written in \"poda,\" an archaic Batak shorthand. According to Winkler, there were three categories of \"Pustaha\" based on the purpose of their usage:\n\nThe \"datu\" or \"guru\" consulted the \"pustaha\" when presented with a difficult problem, and in time this became in itself a ritual. When missionaries began to discourage traditional healing and augury the Bible may have been adopted by some \"gurus\" in place of the \"pustaha\".\n\nAmong the most important healing ceremonies performed in Toba and Karo communities is that of recalling the \"jinujung,\" or personal guardian spirit. According to Toba and Karo cosmology, each person receives a \"jinujung\" in childhood or at puberty and they keep it for life unless they are unfortunate enough to lose it, in which case they will fall ill. In order to call the \"jinujung\" back, a female \"guru\" (\"guru sibaso\" in Karo) goes into a trance and the \"jinujung\" will enter into her and speak through her mouth. At this time the sick person or the family can negotiate ritual payment to entice it to return.\n\nTraditional healers are not powerful enough to cure illness due to the loss of a person's \"tendi\" (this falls under the jurisdiction of the \"datuk\"), however they do play a role in communicating with \"begu\" and influencing their behavior.\n\nMalim is the modern form of the Batak Toba religion. Practitioners of Malim are called Parmalim.\n\nNon-Malim Batak peoples (those following Christian or Muslim faith) often continue to believe certain aspects of traditional Batak spiritual belief.\n\nThe 'Perodak-odak' movement among the Karo people in the 1960s was a reassertion of the traditional Karo religion, but has largely faded; a subsequent Karo movement to identify as Hindu was noted starting from the late 1970s in order to adopt, if only in name, one of the recognised religions of Indonesia, while in practice still following traditional beliefs.\n\nAt the time of Marco Polo's visit in 1292 the people were described as \"wild idolaters\" who had not been influenced by outside religions, however by Ibn Battuta's visit in 1345 Arab traders had established river-ports along the northern coasts of Sumatra and Sultan Al-Malik Al-Dhahir had recently converted to Islam.\n\nSir Stamford Raffles perceived the Batak lands as a buffer between the Islamic Aceh and Minang kingdoms, and encouraged Christian missionary work to preserve this. This policy was continued by the Dutch, who deemed the non-Muslim lands the 'Bataklanden'.\n\nIn 1824 two British Baptist missionaries, Richard Burton and Nathaniel Ward, set off on foot from Sibolga and traveled through the Batak lands. After three days' journey they reached the high valley of Silindung and spent about two weeks in the Batak region. Considering the shortness of their stay their account reveals very intensive first-hand observation. This was followed in 1834 by Henry Lyman (missionary) and Samuel Munson from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions who met with a more hostile reception. According to Ida Pfeiffer:\n\nHerman Neubronner van der Tuuk was employed by the Nederlands Bijbel Genootschap (Netherlands Bible Society) in the 1850s to produce a Batak–Dutch grammar-book and a dictionary, which enabled future Dutch and German missionaries to undertake the conversion of the Toba and Simalungan Batak.\n\nThe first German missionaries to the Lake Toba region arrived in 1861, and a mission was established in 1881 by Dr. Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen of the German Rhenish Missionary Society. The New Testament was first translated into Toba Batak by Dr. Nommensen in 1869 and a translation of the Old Testament was completed by P. H. Johannsen in 1891. The complete text was printed in Latin script in Medan in 1893, although H. O. Voorma describes the translation as “not easy to read, it is rigid and not fluent, and sounds strange to the Batak…[with] a number of errors in the translation.” \n\nThe Toba and Karo Batak accepted Christianity rapidly and by the early 20th century it had become part of their cultural identity.\n\nThis period was characterized by the arrival of Dutch colonists and while most Batak did not oppose the Dutch, the Toba Batak fought a guerrilla war that lasted into the early 20th century and ended only with the death in 1907 of their charismatic priest-warrior-king Si Sisingamangaraja XII, who had battled the Dutch during the First Toba War with both magic and weaponry.\n\nThe Huria Kristen Batak Protestan (HKBP) Church was established in Balige in September, 1917. By the late 1920s a nursing school was training nurse midwives there. In 1941, the Gereja Batak Karo Protestan (GBKP) was established. Although missionaries ceded much power to Batak converts in the first decades of the 20th century, Bataks never pressured the missionaries to leave and only took control of church activities as a result of thousands of foreign missionaries being interned or forced to leave after the 1942 invasion of Sumatra by the Japanese.\n\nThe Gereja Kristen Protestan Simalungun, originally part of the HKBP and preaching in Batak Toba language, eventually became a distinctively Simalungun church, adopting Simalungun customs and language, before finally incorporating as GKPS in 1963.\n\nThe Mandailing and Angkola people, occupying the southern Batak lands, came under the influence of the neighbouring Islamic Minangkabau people as a result of the Padri War (1821–1837). Some Mandailing had previously converted to Islam, but the Padri war was a watershed event, with the Padri Wahabbis suppressing traditional adat and promoting 'pure' Islamic faith. Over time Mandailing Islam, has been brought closer to the predominant Southeastern Shafi`i school of Islam as a result of Mandailing discourse with other Islamic practitioners and the practice of hajj, although traditional elements remain, such as dividing inheritance among all children, a Mandailing rather than Islamic practice. Islam caused the decline in importance of marga, with many Mandailing abandoning their marga in favour of Muslim names, much less so among the Angkola to their North.\n\nThe advent of Islam also caused the relegation of the datuk to a medicine man, with traditional rice-planting ceremonies and other such remnants of traditional culture deemed incompatbile with Islam. The 'pasusur begu', a ceremony invoking ancestors to aid the community, was also suppressed. Other aspects of adat were however tolerated, with the Mandailing Islamic ideology placing adat on the same level as Islamic law, as in contrast with the Minang practice of placing Islamic law above adat. In more recent times, learned Islamic scholars (ulama) studying abroad, have suggested that many traditional Mandailing practices, such as the 'Raja' hereditary leaders, were in conflict with Islam, being indicative of 'pele begu'. The Islamist ulama were in conflict for authority with the Namora-Natora, the traditional village legal practitioners, who were influenced by adat as much as Islam.\n\nChristian missionaries had been active among the northern Mandailing from 1834 onwards, but their progress was restricted by the Dutch government, who feared conflict between newly converted Christians and Muslims. In addition, the lingua franca of the government was Malay, associated with Muslims, as were government civil servants, creating the perception that Islam was the religion of modernity and progress. Missionaries determined that resistance among the Muslim Mandailing to Christianity was strong, and the missionaries abandoned them as 'unreachable people', moving north to evangelize the Toba.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, nearly all Mandailing and Angkola were Muslims. Despite this, the Dutch administration marked them as part of the Bataklanden, and therefore heathen or Christian. This perception was an inaccurate one, and many Mandailing strongly rejected the 'Batak' label. Abdullah Lubis, writing in the 1920s, claimed that while the Mandailing followed Batak marga practice, they had never followed the Batak religion, and that the Mandailing people pre-dated the Toba, having acquired marga directly from 'Hindu' visitors. In the Dutch census, the Mandailing objected strongly to being listed in the census as 'Batak Mandailing'. Mandailing in Malaysia (who migrated in the years following the Padri war), had no such objection to their being deemed 'Malays', and indeed Malaysian Mandailing retain little of their distinct identity, partly due to a British colonial policy of rice-land ownership restrictions for all but Malay-speaking Muslims, and the disapproval of 'Batak' Muslim practices by the existing Malay Muslim population.\n\n\n"}

BoJack Horseman, the washed-up star of the 1990s sitcom \"Horsin' Around\", plans his big return to celebrity relevance with a tell-all autobiography that he dictates to his ghostwriter Diane Nguyen. BoJack also has to contend with the demands of his agent and on-again-off-again girlfriend Princess Carolyn, the misguided antics of his freeloading roommate Todd Chavez, and his friend and rival Mr. Peanutbutter.\n\n\nThe main title theme was composed by Patrick Carney, drummer for the blues-rock duo The Black Keys, with his uncle Ralph Carney. The main sound, starting at the beginning, is a Roland Jupiter-4 analog synthesizer triggered with a click track in ProTools.\n\nThe ending credits theme \"Back in the 90s (BoJack's Theme)\" was performed by the indie-pop act Grouplove. Jesse Novak composed the incidental music.\n\nIn addition, the show featured Lyla Foy's song \"Impossible\" in the end credits of the seventh episode of the first season, the Death Grips song \"No Love\" in the eleventh episode of the first season, and the Rolling Stones song \"Wild Horses\" and Tegan and Sara's \"Closer\" in the season finale. The Courtney Barnett song \"Avant Gardener\" plays during the second-season finale, and Nina Simone's cover of Janis Ian's \"Stars\" closed out the last episode of the third season. The show also features Oberhofer's song \"Sea of Dreams\" on the fourth episode of the third season, \"Fish out of Water\", Magic Sword's \"Infinite\" on the fifth episode of the fourth season, K.Flay's \"Blood in the Cut\" on the sixth episode of the fourth season, and Jenny Owen Youngs's \"Wake Up\" on the twelfth episode of the fourth season.\nPrincess Carolyn's hold music is the song \"Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats\" from the musical \"Cats\". The St. Vincent song \"Los Ageless\" plays throughout the first episode of the fifth season, including the credits. The song “Under Pressure” by The War on Drugs plays through the end of the show and into the credits of Season 5, Episode 12 “The Stopped Show”.\n\nThe soundtrack for \"BoJack Horseman\" was released on Lakeshore Records on September 8, 2017, to coincide with the release of season 4. It includes several songs, amongst them the full version of the main theme, Patrick Carney and Michelle Branch's version of America's \"A Horse with No Name\", Sextina Aquafina's \"Get Dat Fetus, Kill Dat Fetus\", the themes from \"Horsin' Around\" and \"Mr. Peanutbutter's House\", and the entire score for the episode \"Fish Out of Water\".\n\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the first season has an approval rating of 65%, based on 23 reviews. On Metacritic, the season received a score of 59 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Erik Adams' review of the first six episodes gave the series a C+ grade; in the review, Adams wrote that the show \"spoofs the emptiness of celebrity, but does so without any novelty or true insight\". At \"Slate\", Willa Paskin was more enthused. \"[It] is perhaps a little more clever than it is uproariously funny, but it is often very clever, and, moreover, well-tuned to the ludicrousness of the sort of low-level fame that surrounds BoJack\". She likened it to \"30 Rock\" in its ability to \"[present] big ideas without having to commit to them\". Chris Mitchell from Popzara was equally optimistic about the show's future, saying that \"Fans of FX's \"Archer\" or Fox's \"Bob's Burgers\" will definitely want to check this one out, as its rapid-fire delivery is always consciously spot-on\". \"The New York Times\" described the show as \"hilarious and ribald\". Margaret Lyons of Vulture gave a positive review, describing it as \"radically sad. I love it.\"\n\nThe second half of the season, however, received much more positive reviews. Ben Travers of IndieWire believed one possible reason for mixed reviews of the show was critics reviewing only the first half of the season, with the second half changing drastically in tone and developing a darker and deeper meaning. This change was so drastic it resulted in IndieWire changing its policy to only review entire seasons of shows on Netflix, instead of just the first six episodes, which would have boosted \"BoJack Horseman\"'s C+ grade.\n\nThe second season of the show received universal acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes the second season holds an approval rating of 100%, based on 17 critics, whilst on Metacritic, the season has a score of 90 out of 100, based on 7 critics. Vox commented the show had \"found its footing beautifully in season two, earning the title of not just the streaming service's best show, but of one of television's best shows\". Indiewire gave the series an A-, praising the depth of the show's storyline, the voice cast and the superior comedy in comparison to the first season. \"The A.V. Club\" also gave the series an A-, commenting that \"for the most part, it’s an entirely unique, funny, and melancholic exploration into the heart and mind of someone struggling to put his life back on track after a series of dark turns\". \"Slant Magazine\" awarded the series 4-and-a-half stars out of 5, commenting that \"BoJack Horseman’s second season is an even more confident blend of the various tones it experimentally donned last year, as it’s simultaneously melancholic, angry, goofy, playful, and often uproariously funny in a distinctively ineffable what-the-fuck fashion\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the series a B rating, stating it was \"one of TV's best meta-skewers of Hollywood\".\n\nLike the previous season of the show, the third season received universal acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes gives the third season an approval rating of 100%, based on 31 reviews, whilst on Metacritic, the season received a score of 89 out of 100, based on 12 reviews. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" lauded the season, commenting that the show \"evolved from frothy talking-animal Hollywood satire to character-rich treatise on depression in its first season, deepened and darkened into one of TV's best shows in its second season and gallops into its third season with a profound confidence.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the series an A rating, stating the season is \"more digressive than the show’s first two years, and much more open-ended, sending core characters in different directions\" and that it \"builds to one of the funniest, weirdest, and most profound moments ever seen in a television show.\" \"The A.V. Club\" awarded the series an A-, commenting that \"Netflix has taken it upon itself to add BoJack to the line of TV’s famous antiheroes\" and praising the show for improving with each series. Collider gave the show 4/5 stars, stating \"BoJack Horseman ends up becoming a thrilling, rueful study of the psychological games and uniquely vain, notably capitalistic decision-making that powers the entertainment industry\". They went on to praise the show's humor; \"through its venomous jokes and unrelenting, uproarious gags, the series also recognizes how charming, joyful, and galvanizing entertainment for entertainment sake can be, no matter how stupid or silly it may seem.\"\n\nThe fourth season of the show received universal acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes gave the season an approval rating of 97%, based on 31 reviews, while Metacritic awarded the show a score of 87 based on 5 reviews. Indiewire gave the series an A grade, commenting that \"by the end of the season, we know these characters, and this show, far better than ever before. BoJack’s signature tropes—the background visual jokes, the animal puns, the brutal moments of sadness—remain reliably consistent, but turns the focus largely inward, ensuring that some of the more outlandish plots support and highlight the more emotional storylines\". \"The Washington Post\" lauded the series, praising the installment as \"moving and unexpected\" and that \"it offers hope but never ignores the sorrows that are inevitable in real life\". \"The New York Times\" also gave a positive review, commenting that the \"material has the snap and the poignancy we’ve grown accustomed to\" and that \"while nothing matches the adventurousness of Season 3’s underwater film festival episode, Season 4’s ninth episode — narrated from the future by a distant descendant of Princess Carolyn’s — is a devastating example of what 'BoJack' can do at its best\".\n\nKeeping up with the performance of previous seasons, the fifth season received universal acclaim. Based on 31 reviews, Rotten Tomatoes gave the season a score of 100%. Indiewire gave the season an \"A\" calling it another brilliant season and saying the series has become so great that it is \"beyond reproach\". Multiple critical reviews have praised the episode \"Free Churro\", calling it one of the series' best episodes and giving it Emmy buzz for both the writing and Will Arnett's monologue. \"The A.V. Club\" observed that the episode \"The Dog Days Are Over\", where Diane Nguyen takes an impromptu trip to Hanoi, can be seen as a commentary on the \"identity crisis elements\" of having the Vietnamese-American character Diane voiced by a white actress.\n\nOn October 30, 2018, a sixth season was officially picked up. Jonny Sun was added to the writing team.\n\nIn the fall of 2010, \"BoJack Horseman\" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg met with The Tornante Company producer Steven A. Cohen and pitched five different animated projects, from which \"BoJack Horseman\" was chosen. Bob-Waksberg later met with The Tornante Company CEO Michael Eisner, who suggested that the show center around a former racehorse rather than a former sitcom actor. While they settled on the show-business angle, this contributed to a storyline in which BoJack played a racehorse in the fictional movie \"Secretariat\".\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Lisa Hanawalt was asked to work as a designer on the show. She initially turned down the offer, which she has said was because she was \"kind of commitment-phobic\". She eventually took the job six months later. She then worked with animation production studio ShadowMachine to develop the show's visual style.\n\nBob-Waksberg pitched \"BoJack Horseman\" to Netflix in October 2013, and it was picked up for a first season that was released in August 2014. \n\nWriters for \"BoJack Horseman\" include Bob-Waksberg, Joe Lawson, Kate Purdy, Elijah Aron, Jordan Young Mehar Sethi, and Joanna Calo. Directors include Amy Winfrey, J.C. Gonzalez, Mike Hollingsworth, Aaron Long, and Anne Walker Farrell.\n\nCreator Raphael Bob-Waksberg has cited the cynical humor in the Canadian show \"The Newsroom\" as a large influence on \"BoJack Horseman\". He also praised \"The Simpsons\" as an influence for being able to tell sad stories without sacrificing humor. Based on storyline similarities and graphical nuances, the series has been said to have influences deriving from \"Californication\", \"Two and a Half Men\" and \"Daria\". In September 2018, before the show's fifth season was released, Bob-Waksberg has stated what the show's ten biggest influences were:\n\nSince its first season, \"Bojack\" has addressed many hot-button sociopolitical issues. Its creator, Raphael Bob-Waksberg, once said that he considered the concept of \"political correctness\" something that other comedians and media creators should view as more of a responsibility: In a 2017 interview with VICE, he said, \"I think most people who argue for what you might call political correctness, are not actually arguing for censorship. They're arguing for self-control and self-restraint. They're arguing for people to be conscious of the power they have, right? And I believe that I have a lot of power, as someone making popular entertainment. I do think we have to be careful about the art we put out.\"The seventh episode of the second season was perhaps one of the most notable examples of the show's voice on this issue. The season 2 episode \"Hank After Dark,\" commonly referred to as \"the Cosby episode,\" follows Diane and Bojack on a book tour as they field questions regarding allegations that have just surfaced about a comedy legend, Hank Hippopopalous. In the third season episode \"Brrap Brrap Pew Pew\" (episode 6), Diane accidentally announces she is getting an abortion via pop starlet Sextina Aquafina's Twitter account, and Hollywoo gets swept up in talks about the practice. The season 4 episode \"Thoughts and Prayers,\" took a similar satirical approach towards the frequency of mass shootings and the gun debate in America, after Diane fires a gun for the first time and one of Princess Carolyn's projects get caught in the crossfire, launching a debate on whether or not women should own and use guns.\n\nSeason 5 has been praised for its handling of sexual harassment and powerful men following the Me Too movement. Todd VanDerWerff wrote that it \"just might be the best artistic rumination on #MeToo and an age of terrible men yet.\"\n\nThe show also explores Todd Chavez's open asexuality, which is addressed throughout seasons 4 and 5. In the last episode of the third season, Todd says \"I’m not gay... I mean, I don’t think I am, but I don’t think I’m straight, either. I don’t know what I am. I think I might be nothing.\"\n\nOn July 26, 2018, Comedy Central acquired exclusive linear television rights to the series. The series premiered on the network after the \"South Park\" season 22 premiere on September 26, 2018. The series' syndication deal makes it also the first Netflix original to be syndicated on linear television in the United States.\nEpisodes could also be found on the Comedy Central website.\n\n"}

Most of them restored after the Khmer rouge ended and by the help from Thailand. Therefore, the dances styles in Cambodia are highly influenced from Thai dance styles.\n\nCambodia's premier performing art form is the Khmer classical dance, or \"Robam Preah Reach Trop\", a highly stylized dance form originating from the royal courts. Performances of classical dance consist of elaborately costumed dancers and music played by a pinpeat ensemble. It is performed for invocation of deities and spirits as well as to pay homage to royalty and guests. In the mid-20th century, it was introduced to the general public and became widely celebrated as iconic of Cambodian culture, often being performed during public events, holidays, and for tourists visiting Cambodia. Two of the most performed classical dance are the \"Robam Chuon Por\" (\"Wishing dance\") and the \"Robam Tep Apsara\" (\"Apsara dance\").\n\nCreated in the 20th century are folk dances that emphasize that various cultural traditions and ethnic groups of Cambodia. Cambodian folk dances are usually more fast-paced than classical dances. The movements and gestures are not as stylized as classical dance. Folk dancers wear clothes of the people they are portraying such as Chams, hill tribes, farmers, and peasants. Some folk dances are about love or folktales. Most of the music of folk dances is played by a mahori orchestra.\n\n\nIn Cambodia, social dances are dances which are danced at social gatherings. Such dances are: Romvong, Romkbach, Saravann, Chok Krapeus and Lam Leav. In addition, other social dances from around the world have affected Cambodian social culture include the Cha-cha, Bolero, and the Madison. Such dances are often performed at Cambodian banquet parties.\n\n\n"}

According to the Anglo authors as it usually is it was the United States' Anglo-Saxon's ethnic-ideological identity that, according to Paul McCartney, drove it to enter into the Spanish–American War. Similarly, United States foreign policy in the mid-20th century was shaped in favor of South African apartheid, according to Catherine Scott, as a result of the influence of people who identified with the Afrikaners based on a feeling of shared \"whiteness.\"\n\nIn the United States, according to Alexander DeConde, the \"World War quickened the ethnic consciousness of minority groups. They promptly created organizations to help the causes of their old European homelands that had become belligerents. Through whatever means possible, the ethnic activists among them sought to give direction to Washington on matters of policy that affected their overseas kin, making the United States a lobbying battleground between rival interest groups emotionally entangled in the war.\"\n\nAmbrosio writes that \"during the Cold War, the influence of ethnic identity groups was limited by the nature of both the international system and the U.S. foreign policy process.\" The ethnic identity groups had limited influence during this period because:\n\nHistorian Samuel P. Huntington writes that in the post–Cold War international system, there is uncertainty and confusion in the United States as to what are its national interests. Contributing to this confusing is the rise of multiculturalism and its eroding of a singular \"American identity.\" The lack of a coherent national identity makes its challenging for the state to articulate its true interests, thus it becomes less resistant to the influence exerted by ethnic interest groups whose ethnocentric goals, at best, may only align with broad \"American interests\" by chance.\n\nPolitical scientist Thomas Ambrosio writes in 2002 that there \"has been a growing acceptance that ethnic identity groups have the right to mobilize politically for the purpose of influencing U.S. policies at home and abroad. This has resulted in a rise in the number and ethnic lobbies as well as their influence.\" Additional trends include an \"increasing rejection of cultural assimilation and, in its place, growing support for expressions of ethnic diversity\" as well as a decreasing tendency for Americans \"to make charges of disloyalty against those who retain ties to their ethnic kin abroad and who advocate positions in line with the interests of their homeland.\" The proliferation of ethnic conflicts has also heightened the stakes for many ethnic groups causing concerted efforts to expand their influence on U.S. foreign policy as the \"independence, survival, or general welfare of a group's ethnic kin or homeland is threatened.\"\n\nThere are multiple perspectives as to the value of the influence of ethnic interest groups on the foreign policy of the United States, much like there are conflicting interpretations of the influence of ethnic interest groups in general, see Ethnic interest groups – conflicting interpretations. Yossi Shain writes that in \"many ways […] the participation of ethnic diasporas in shaping U.S. foreign policy is a truly positive phenomena.\" A less positive assessment comes from Tony Smith, who writes that at \"present, the negative consequences of ethnic involvement may way outweigh the undoubted benefits this activism at times confers on America in world affairs.\"\n\n"}

Mon de Clopper was president of the Europeade until 1997, when he was succeeded by the current president Bruno Peeters (born 1939), also from Flanders.\n\nThe goal of the Europeade is to foster a united Europe, where everyone contributes and develops his or her own culture, respecting everyone else.

Ostrich, marabou, chandelle, and turkey are the most common feathers used, although non-feather boas are also available. Feathers used go through bleaching or dyeing processes and are glued and stitched into lengths called \"ply\". Sometimes more natural boas are produced. A lightweight chandelle boa might only weigh , whereas a 24 ply ostrich boa can weigh as much as . The more ply, the fluffier and thicker the boa. Boas are generally measured by weight (grammes), length (centimetres), and ply. Boas are available through novelty, costume, or lingerie shops, as well as online.\n\nWith the development of \"fun fur\" or \"eyelash\" yarns in the late 20th century, an adept craftsperson can knit a boa of one solid color or a mix of various colors. Yarn boas do not \"shed\" like feather boas and are favored for their soft texture against the neck. The rounded boa shape is achieved by knitting one row and purling the next row, then repeating this pattern until reaching the desired length.\n\nOstrich —\nThousands of long thin feather strands woven into ply are used to construct these very fluffy boas. These form the larger, Las Vegas showgirl type boas, as when they are coloured and woven into many ply, they can look very dramatic even at a distance.\n\nTurkey —\nMany larger flat turkey feathers form these heavier boas which might weigh between 120 and 400 grams and reach in diameter.\n\nMarabou —\nThe fine down from marabou is used to form these very thin, and very fluffy boas.\n\nChandelle —\nSmaller feathers or \"flats\" from the turkey are used to create these lighter boas with smaller diameters.\n\nFeather boas have been documented for use as an adornment since at least 1820, but they might have been worn as early as the 17th century. Feather boas have fallen in and out of fashion many times over the years. Feather boas have had the reputation of being elegant as well as being considered campy or vulgar apparel. \n\nSome historic eras where feather boas were in style or trendy include: the late Victorian era and Edwardian era (between 1890 and 1915), the 1920s, and the 1970s during the glam rock and disco music eras.\n\nEntertainers have long used feather boas as part of their act. A few feather boa wearers include: dancer Isadora Duncan; singer Shirley Bassey; actor/comedian Mae West; wrestlers Jesse Ventura, Superstar Billy Graham, and Hulk Hogan; singers Scott Weiland, Celia Cruz, Cher, Marc Bolan, Gerard Way, and Elton John; and numerous other opera and cabaret singers.\n\nSocial clubs such as the Red Hat Society, or those who are involved with historic re-enactment societies, wear boas at meetings while they are often worn as a costume accessory for parties around holiday seasons such as Halloween or Mardi Gras in New Orleans.\n\nFeather boas are worn around campus by new members of the Mask & Wig Club at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nFeather boas are worn for erotic seduction purposes and are at times considered fetish wear.

It is signed and dated 1488 on the centre of the Virgin Mary's throne, though it may have taken several years to produce, meaning he started it in 1485. On the reverse is a label dating its completion more precisely, to 15 February 1488. It is in the basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari in Venice.\n\nIts central scene is the Madonna and Child enthroned with two angel musicians, flanked to the left by saint Nicholas of Bari and saint Peter and to the right by saint Mark (patron of Venice) and saint Benedict. The work's division into compartments is rather old-fashioned and may have been explicitly demanded by the commissioner, but Bellini uses this to his advantage, integrating the painted architecture with the frame, which he designed himself. This develops the illusionism of his San Giobbe Altarpiece, again placing the Virgin in a deep blue mantle on a high marble throne, using a golden light and a Byzanto-Venetian-style apse. To the sides thin strips of landscape suggest a vast space behind the work, whilst the trompe l'oeil apse behind the Virgin bears an inscription reading (\"Certain gate of heaven, guide [my] mind, direct [my] life: may everything I do be entrusted to your care\").\n"}
{"id": "434110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=434110", "title": "Free writing", "text": "Free writing\n\nFree writing is a prewriting technique in which a person writes continuously for a set period of time without regard to spelling, grammar, or topic. It produces raw, often unusable material, but helps writers overcome blocks of apathy and self-criticism. It is used mainly by prose writers and writing teachers. Some writers use the technique to collect initial thoughts and ideas on a topic, often as a preliminary to formal writing. Free writing is not the same as automatic writing.\n\nUnlike brainstorming where ideas are simply listed, in freewriting one writes sentences to form a paragraph about whatever comes to mind.\n\nDorothea Brande was an early proponent of freewriting. In her book \"Becoming a Writer\" (1934), she advises readers to sit and write for 30 minutes every morning, as fast as they can.\n\nPeter Elbow advanced freewriting in his book \"Writing Without Teachers\" (1975), and it has been popularized by Julia Cameron through her book \"The Artist's Way\" (1992).\n\nThe technique involves continuous writing, usually for a predetermined period of time (often five to fifteen minutes). The writer writes without regard to spelling, grammar, etc., and makes no corrections. If the writer reaches a point where they can't think of anything to write, it is presumed they will \"write\" that they can't think of anything or repeat words, until they find another line of thought. The writer freely strays off topic, letting thoughts lead where they may. At times, a writer may also do a focused freewrite, letting a chosen topic structure their thoughts. Expanding from this topic, the thoughts may stray to make connections and create more abstract views on the topic. This technique helps a writer explore a particular subject before putting ideas into a more basic context.\n\nFreewriting is often done on a daily basis as a part of the writer's daily routine. Also, students in many writing courses are assigned to do such daily writing exercises.\n\nThe writing does not have to be done with pen and paper. A technique known as Freeblogging combines blogging with free-writing with the rules changed so that the writer does not stop typing for long periods of time. The end result may or may not be shared with the public.\n\nFree writing is based on a presumption that, while everybody has something to say and the ability to say it, the mental wellspring may be blocked by apathy, self-criticism, resentment, anxiety about deadlines, fear of failure or censure, or other forms of resistance. The accepted rules of free-writing enable a writer to build up enough momentum to blast past blocks into uninhibited flow, the concept outlined by writing teachers such as Louise Dunlap, Peter Elbow, and Natalie Goldberg.\n\nFree-writing is all about loosening and limbering the thought process, not about a product or a performance for a student or a writer.\n\nOften free-writing workshops focus on self-expression, and are sometimes even used in teaching to elementary school children. There is no common consensus on the acceptance of this technique.\n\n, often referred as Natalie Goldberg's first four rules of writing:\n\nGoldberg's rules appear to be based on those developed by Jack Kerouac, whom she cites several times. Kerouac developed 30 \"rules\" in his Belief & Technique for Modern Prose. While Kerouac's \"rules\" are elliptical and even cryptic for beginning writers, they are more comprehensive than Goldberg's for those who have practised prose writing for some time. Kerouac supplemented these with his Essentials of Spontaneous Prose, and together they form the basis of his prose writing method, a form of narrative stream of consciousness. Kerouac himself cites the \"trance writing\" of William Butler Yeats as a precursor of his own practice.\n\nGoldberg's rules, which are infused with the study and practice of Zen Buddhism, make the process of free writing more accessible for a beginner and are perhaps less extreme than those of Kerouac, although they are still tinged with an element of mysticism.\n\n"}

Gender sensitization may be seen as \"the awareness informed disposition or propensity to behave in a manner which is sensitive to gender justice and gender equality issues.\"\n\nIt is interlinked with gender empowerment. Gender sensitization theories claim that modification of the behavior of teachers and parents (etc.) towards children which can have a causal effect on gender equality.\n\nGender sensitizing \"is about changing behavior and instilling empathy into the views that we hold about our own and the other genders.\" It helps people in \"examining their personal attitudes and beliefs and questioning the 'realities' they thought they know.\n\nGender Sensitization is one basic requirement for the normal development of an individual.

The need for this sensitivity has been felt and realised through times immemorial and in almost all kinds of human existence, across the globe.\n\n"}

Graphism began some 30,000 years BC, not as a photographic representation of reality but as an abstraction that was geared toward magical-religious matters. Early graphism then was a form of writing that constitutes a 'symbolic transposition, not copying of reality'.\n\nThe earliest traces of graphism date back to 30,000 years BC at the end of the Mousterian period and became more prevalent in the Chatelperronian period toward 35,000 BC. While it can be claimed that language merely represents a logical development of the vocal signals of the animal world, nothing comparable to the writing and reading of symbols existed before the dawn of homo sapiens. While motor function determines expression in the techniques and language of all anthropoids, reflection determines graphism in the figurative language of the most recent anthropoids.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that graphism first appeared in the form of tight curves or series of lines engraved in bone or stone. However, there has been no substantial proof to support this hypothesis, with the only comparison being the Australian tjurunga, stone or wood tablets engraved with abstract designs (spirals, straight lines, and clusters of dots) that represented objects of religious significance. The first forms of graphism that allow one to hazardly identify an animal, did not appear until around 30,000 B.C. Prehistoric art records are very numerous, and statistical processing has allowed us to unravel the general meaning of what they represented. The earliest known paintings do not represent a hunt or a family scene, but are graphic building blocks without any associated description. All these early forms therefore suggests that figurative art was directly linked with language and was, in the broadest sense, much closer to writing than to what we understand by a work of art. It was symbolic transposition, not copying of reality, that is to say that graphism did not begin start by reproducing reality in a slavishly photographic manner, but with abstraction.\n\nThe discovery of prehistoric art in the late 19th century raised the issue of a \"naive\" state, an art by which humans supposedly represented what they saw as a result of an aesthetic triggering effect. It was soon realized near the beginning of the 20th century that this view was mistaken, and that magical-religious concerns were responsible for the figurative art of the Cenozoic Era, as indeed for almost all art except in a few rare \"hunting tallies\" etched on bone during the Paleolithic period.\n\n"}

{"id": "45102736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45102736", "title": "History of business architecture", "text": "History of business architecture\n\nThe history of business architecture has its origins in the 1980s. In the next decades business architecture has developed into a discipline of \"cross-organizational design of the business as a whole\" closely related to enterprise architecture. The concept of business architecture has been proposed as a blueprint of the enterprise, as business strategy, and also as the representation of business design.\n\nThe concept of business architecture has evolved over the years. It was introduced in the 1980s as architectural domains and as activity of business design. In the 2000s the study and concept development of business architecture accelerated. By the end of the 2000s the first handbooks on business architecture were published, separate frameworks for business architecture were being developed, separate views and models for business architecture were further under construction, the business architect as a profession evolved, and more businesses added business architecture to their agenda.\n\nBy 2015 business architecture has evolved into a common practice. The business architecture body of knowledge has been developed and is updated multiple times each year, and the interest from the academic world and from top management is growing.\n\nBusiness architecture has its roots in traditional cross-organizational design. Bodine and Hilty (2009) stipulated, that the \"responsibility for the cross-organizational design of the business as a whole, the work of the Business Architect, has historically fallen to the CEO or their assignee, supported by generalist management consulting firms whose teams of MBAs work with corporate managers to transform strategy into new business configurations using the newest tools.\" John Zachman (2012) commented in this context, that \"a lot of material has been written about business architecture (by some definition), going back to \"The Principles of Scientific Management\" (1911) by Frederick Taylor.\"\n\nOne of the roots of business architecture lies in the proposals for enterprise architecture made since the 1980s and 1990s. Bernus & Noran (2010) distinguished two types of proposals. On the one hand \"Proposals that created generally applicable ‘blueprints’ (later to be called reference models, partial models...) so that the activities involved in the creation (or the change) of the enterprise could refer to such a common model (or set of models).\" And on the other hand \"proposals which claimed that to be able to organise the creation, and later the change, of enterprises one needs to understand the life cycle of the enterprise and of its parts... the ‘Enterprise Reference Architecture’.\"\n\nMore specific about the emerge of business architecture Whelan & Meaden (2012) described, that this emerged against a backdrop of change. The business architecture is \"maturing into a discipline in its own right, rising from the pool of inter-related practices that include business strategy, enterprise architecture, business portfolio planning and change management – to name but a few.\n\nThe concept of business architecture emerged in the 1980s in the field of information systems development. One of the first to mention business architecture was the British management consultant Edwin E. Tozer in the 1986 article \"Developing strategies for management information systems.\" He introduced the concept of business architecture in the context of business information systems planning, and distinguished:\nAnd he explained, that \"each entity class in the Information Architecture is represented in some database and each business function may be supported by one or more systems.\" In this paper Tozer was \"prescriptive about the order in which [strategy] issues should be identified.\", and focussed on \"IS adaptability to organizational strategies.\"\n\nThe American organizational theorist William R. Synnott (1987) presented one of the first models of business architecture, (see image), in the context of data management. Synnott wanted to develop an overall Information Resource Management (IRM) architecture, and proposed business architecture as its foundation. He described: \n\nBusiness architecture is the foundation upon which the IRM architecture rests. The architectural model consists of a set of building-blocks of linked architectures which together form the basis for the technology infrastructure of the firm... In the figure data architecture and communication architecture are shown as horizontal bars because these are corporate-wide information resource components. They serve all business units. The four vertical resource components are business specific. The resources can be divided according to the business units they serve. That us, data and communication might be centralizes resources, whereas human resources (professional systems staffs), computers, user-computing, and systems could all be decentralized resources to one degree or another.\n\nThis model of Information Resource Management (IRM) distinguished seven types of architecture: \n\nThis type of architectural model classifies different types of architecture. In the later theories and models different sets of architectures have been proposed. For example, the late 1980s NIST Enterprise Architecture Model distinguished five types, and this was incorporated in the 1990s Federal Enterprise Architecture, which contained four types of architecture.\n\nSynnott (1987) furthermore described, how business architecture should work and introduced the idea of architectural planning:\n\nThe business architecture of the company (organization structure, strategic business units and missions, product and services) is the foundation of IRM planning. Since every company has an existing architecture, architectural planning begins with an inventory of the firm's information resources. Assembling the various information resource components' inventories results in an \"as is\" picture of the corporation's technology structure. From this inventory, the CIO can analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the company's information resources, particularly as they relate to business information needs as identified in the strategic planning process. From this analysis one can evolve an architectural plan, which is a \"to be\" picture of where one wants to go and how to get there, not just a picture of the status quo.\n\nCees J. Schrama. (1988) of the European IFIP Technical Committee on Information Systems IFIP TC8 presented the opinion, that \"business architecture is required to provide a solid base for the total development process.\" He pictured another model consisted of elements such as information processing architecture and network architecture, and explained:\n\n[Business architecture] contains the fundamentals for the information processing architecture, where process data, support systems and network architecture are performed. In business architecture the following can 'be identified:\nThere are some basic elements in business architecture: management, organization, processes to be performed and data to be made available/delivered. In the past, when mainly operational systems were developed, the processes received considerable attention. Information was seen as being needed to perform processes. This is changing. It is becoming important to have data available to serve information retrieval needs as well.\n\nThese ideas around the concept of architectural planning evolved in th early 1990s into frameworks, such as TAFIM, the predecessor of TOGAF.\n\nIn the 1987 article \"A Framework for Information Systems Architecture\" John Zachman presented some of the principles of Enterprise architecture,\n\nIn the 5th NIST workshop on Information Management Directions (1989) a working groups under guidance of W. Bradford Rigdon developed one of the first Enterprise Architecture frameworks, the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model. In this model business architecture was incorporated as one of the layers of Enterprise Architecture. Bradford Rigdon et al. (1989) brought it like this:\n\nA discussion of architecture must take into account different levels of architecture. These levels can be illustrated by a pyramid, with the business unit at the top and the delivery system at the base. An enterprise is composed of one or more Business Units that are responsible for a specific business area. The five levels of architecture are\nThe levels are separate yet interrelated... The idea if an enterprise architecture reflects an awareness that the levels are logically connected and that a depiction at one level assumes or dictates that architectures at the higher level.\n\nIn the original 1989 illustration of the NIST AE Framework (see image) the top layer was named \"Business Unit Architecture.\" In representation of this model in the 1990s the top layer was named \"Business architecture.\"\n\nIn the 1990s the information age was unfolding changing the global market economy. With the businesses adapting, the new concept of business architecture was presented as promising alternative. Gharajedaghi (1999) explained the context:\n\nIn a global market economy with ever-increasing levels of disturbance, a viable business can no longer be locked into a single form or function. Success comes from a self-renewing capability to spontaneously create structures and functions that fit the moment. In this context, proper functioning of self-reference would certainly prevent the vacillations and the random search for new products/markets that have, over the past years, destroyed so many businesses.In fact, the ability to continuously match the portfolio of internal competencies with the portfolio of emerging market opportunities is the foundation of the emerging concept of new business architecture...\n\nAccording to Bodine and Hilty (2009) \"important advances in this area borrowed from the operations discipline came in 1993 in the form of Michael Hammer and James Champy‘s book \"Reengineering the Corporation\", which introduced tools for mapping and optimizing business activities using process modeling. The Balanced Scorecard developed by Robert Kaplan and David Norton at about the same time enabled the business to measure overall corporate success against goals on qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions.\"\n\nIn the 1990s works the concept of business architecture is presented in distinguished ways: \n\nBusiness architectures is presented as tool for change management, acknowledged Van Rensburg (1997). It \"provide organisations with the means to understand organisational activities in such a manner that it is used as a mechanism to support the organisation through the business transformation process. Using an object-oriented modelling approach in the design of the business architecture allows for a robust modelling approach which captures real world instances in a business architecture repository. This enables the creation and caption of organisational understanding required for the transformation process.\"\n\nIn 1996 the US government introduced the Clinger–Cohen Act, to improve the acquisition and management of their information resources.\n\nBeside the enterprise architecture frameworks a second type of architectural models were proposed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which were called Enterprise Reference Architecture. \n\nIn 1999 two works on business architecture and its foundation were published, which became two of the most cited works on business architecture. In his \"Systems thinking: Managing chaos and complexity\" Jamshid Gharajedaghi presented a set of principles to design business architecture, which were based on systems thinking. Gharajedaghi argued, that business Architecture should be considered a system:\n\nBusiness Architecture is a general description of a system. It identifies its purpose, vital functions, active elements, and critical processes and defines the nature of the interaction among them. Business architecture consists of a set of distinct but interrelated platforms, creating a multidimensional modular system. Each platform represents a dimension of the system, signifying a unique mode of behavior with a predefined set of performance criteria and measures.\n\nThe IBM researcher Douglas W. McDavid presented the paper \"A standard for business architecture description.\" According to Evernden & Evernden (2003) this paper described a \"high-level semantic framework of standard business concepts – abstracted from experience, enterprise business models, the organization of business terminology and the various generic industry reference models. There is an excellent discussion on what constitutes business architecture and the nature and use of information categories, although concepts such as product and agreement seem to be missing.\" McDavid argued:\n\nThe concepts in the Business Architecture description provide a semantic framework for speaking about common business concerns... For our purposes, this semantic structure provides a common set of concept patterns to be able to understand the types of content that needs to be supported in technology-based information systems... a set of generic concepts and their interrelationships organize business information content in terms of requirements on the business, the boundary of the business, and the business as a system for delivery of value.\n\nAccording to Bodine and Hilty (2009)\n\nThe arrival of Internet technologies like email, instant messaging and online data repositories in the mid-1990s opened up tremendous flexibilities in the ways co-workers could collaborate, while the new ability of buyers and sellers to interact in virtual space and transact online changed the traditional structure of businesses...\nBy the late 1990s, MBAs with advanced skills in Internet technologies began developing live business models for e-commerce websites in real-time. They used the development tools to both represent and build the business at the same time. The model became the business, and thousands were launched, allowing companies to access vast volumes of data and respond rapidly to changing market conditions... A Google search on ―Business Architect‖ at the time returned just 12 results... A Google search on ―Business Architect‖ in 2009 returns over 1 million listings.\nThis is just the beginning of a valuable and rapidly expanding profession. Today‘s Business Architects take a holistic view of the complete business representing all interests and engaging all expertise. They see the business organization as a constantly changing, dynamic organism that balances central planning with individual initiative to achieve its mission through the articulate implementation of its corporate strategy.\n\nAccording to Bodine and Hilty (2009)\n\nImportant advances in this area borrowed from the operations discipline came in 1993 in the form of Michael Hammer and James Champy‘s book \"Reengineering the Corporation\", which introduced tools for mapping and optimizing business activities using process modeling. The Balanced Scorecard developed by Robert Kaplan and David Norton at about the same time enabled the business to measure overall corporate success against goals on qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions.\n\nAccording to Bernus & Noran (2010):\nArchitecture Frameworks have been used in many industries, including the domains of industrial automation / manufacturing / production management, business information systems (of various kinds), telecommunications and defence. Part of the Enterprise Architecture practice is ‘enterprise engineering’ and the practice of ‘enterprise modelling’ (or just modelling) and complete AFs describe the scope of modelling (which later can be summaised as a Modelling Framework that is part of the AF).\n\nOne specific type of Framework is called the \"Enterprise Reference Architecture.\" According to Bernus & Noran (2010):\nSeveral proposals emerged in those two decades – e.g. PERA (Williams 1994), CIMOSA (CIMOSA Association 1996), ARIS (Scheer 1999), GRAI-GIM (Doumeingts, 1987), and the IFIP-IFAC Task Force, based on a thorough review of these as well as their proposed generalisation (Bernus and Nemes, 1994) developed GERAM (IFIP-IFAC Task Force, 1999) which then became the basis of ISO15704:2000 “Industrial automation systems – Requirements for enterprise-reference architectures and methodologies”...\n\nThe Business Architecture Special Interest Group (BASIG) is a working group on business architecture of the Object Management Group (OMG). This working group was founded in 2007 as the Business Architecture Working Group (BAWG).\n\nIn the 2006 article \"Business Architecture: A new paradigm to relate business strategy to ICT,\" Versteeg & Bouwman explained the relation between business architecture, business activities and business strategy. They wrote:\nWe use the concept of 'Business Architecture’ to structure the responsibility over business activities prior to any further effort to structure individual aspects (processes, data, functions, organization, etc.). The business architecture arranges the responsibilities around the most important business activities (for instance production, distribution, marketing, et cetera) and/or economic activities (for instance manufacturing, assembly, transport, wholesale, et cetera) into domains \n\nVersteeg & Bouwman also stipulated, that \"the perspectives for subsequent design next to organization are more common: information architecture, technical architecture, process architecture. The various parts (functions, concepts and processes) of the business architecture act as a compulsory starting point for the different subsequent architectures. It pre-structures other architectures. Business architecture models shed light on the scantly elaborated relationships between business strategy and business design. We will illustrate the value of business architecture in a case study.\"\n\nIn the 2010 the first handbooks on Business architecture were published. In the US William M. Ulrich and Neal McWhorter of the OMG Business Architecture Special Interest Group published the \"Business Architecture: The Art and Practice of Business Transformation,\" in 2010.\n\nIn 2012 in Britain the business consultants Jonathan Whelan and Graham Meaden published their \"Business Architecture: A Practical Guide.\"\n\nIn several sources in the exact definition of \"business architecture\" is under review. InN 2008 Jeff Scott had commented in this matter: \nInterest in business architecture is growing dramatically. During the past two years both IT and business leaders have joined the discussion about the need for a well-defined business architecture. Though there is a great deal of discussion, there is little consensus about what business architecture is, how it should be pursued, and what value it delivers. Business architects in IT as well as in the business have started developing business-unit-wide and enterprise-wide business architectures, learning as they go. Their ultimate goals are to improve business decision-making and facilitate better alignment between IT and the business units it supports. Architecture teams that want to play a leading role in business architecture development must start soon or be left behind.\n\nOther sources came to the same conclusion, that over the years many different definitions of business architecture have been proposed Some of the more notable definitions have described business architecture as: \n\nThe discussion kept going. John Zachman (2012) declared in this matter, that \"a lot of people define business architecture differently (I know a lot of people who have a lot of different opinions and definitions for business architecture). Not too many people do business architecture, at least not in a comprehensive and definitive fashion (in my estimation)...\" \nIdeas and definitions about business architecture originate from different academic sub disciplines, where the concept of business architecture and methods and techniques are developing in numerous initiatives. A selection of related subfields:\n\nGuitarte (2013) stipulated, that also different types of organizations have been active, and created a so-called \"business architecture vortex.” He listed four types:\n\nGuitarte commented, that \"influencers led followed by communities of practice and standards-setting bodies; vendors followed. Conflicting ideas provide opportunity to define the future of business architecture profession.\"\n\nSurveys have reported a growing interest of management in business architecture, as well as on universities:\n\n\n"}

The oldest parts of the house have been dated to the 4th century BC, but the main expansions were built in the 2nd century BC. The long history of this structure provides important evidence about the development of elite residences in Pompeii. The house is located on the east side of the Via Consolare. It received its modern name from an election notice placed on the facade, recommending Gaius Sallustius for office. An alternative name is the House of A. Cossus Libanus, from a seal found in the ruins.\n\nIt was first excavated between 1805 and 1809, was damaged by a bomb in World War II, and was restored in 1970.\n\nThe House of Sallust was originally a single atrium house from the Samnite Period, and was made of Tufa blocks. It had six shops on its west side and an entrance corridor in the middle. This went through into the atrium with compluvium and impluvium. The atrium contained two alae, four cubicula, a tablinum, four other rooms and a garden.\nOver time, we can see the addition of new features, such as the peristyle (a colonnaded garden) which was imported from Greece in the 2nd century BC, and the second atrium, which also became popular around this time. It eventually expanded to use almost all the garden space, but its development was cut short due to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33523320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33523320", "title": "Indigenization", "text": "Indigenization\n\nIndigenization is the act of making something more native; transformation of some service, idea, etc. to suit a local culture, especially through the use of more indigenous people in administration, employment, etc.\n\nThe term is primarily used by anthropologists to describe what happens when locals take something from the outside and make it their own (e.g. Africanization, Americanization).\n\nIn world politics, indigenization is the process in which non-Western cultures redefine their native land for better use in agriculture and mass marketing. Due to imperialism and the impetus to modernize, many countries and cultures invoked Western values and ideals of liberalism, democracy and independence in the past. But now, along with experiencing their own share of cultural confidence, they desire to revert to their traditional cultures and values.\n\nHowever, the word indigenization is also used in almost the opposite sense, it means: to increase local participation in or ownership of, to indigenize foreign-owned companies, or to adapt (beliefs, customs, etc.) to local ways.\n\nThe word indigenization first appeared in a paper about studies conducted in India about Christian missionaries. The word was used to describe the process of making Churches indigenous in southern India. From there, it spread to The Economist where it was used to describe managerial positions and to a book by John Spencer, named \"English Language in West Africa,\" where it was used to describe the adoption of English. Indigenization is often used to describe the adoption of colonial culture in Africa because of the effects of colonialism by Europe in the 19th and early 20th century.\n\nThroughout history, the process of making something indigenous has taken different forms. Other words that describe similar processes of making something local are Africanization, Localization, Glocalization, and Americanization. However, these terms describe a specific case of the process of making something indigenous. These terms may be rejected in favor of the more general term of indigenization because the others may have too narrow of a scope. For example, Christianization was a form of indigenization by converting areas and groups to follow Christianity.\n\nIn this context, indigenization is used to refer to how a language is adopted in a certain area such as French in Africa. The term is used to describe the process of conveying a certain region’s culture and concepts in terms of the language that is being introduced. A common case where a language needed to be indigenized was in Africa where the ex-colonizer's language required some references to African religion and culture, even though in the original language there was no vocabulary for this. As this process is being carried out, there is usually a metalanguage created that is some combination of the original language and the introduced language. This language shares cultural aspects from both cultures, making it distinct and usually done in order to understand the foreign language in the context of the local region. Sometimes the term indigenization is preferred over other terms such as Africanization because it carries no negative connotations and does not imply any underlying meaning.\n\nIndigenization is seen as the process of changing someone to a person of more corroboration towards their surroundings. A large part of that process is the economy of said surroundings. Indigenization has played an important part in the economic roles of society. Thanks to The Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act, black people were offered a more distinguished position in the economy, with foreigners having to give up 51% of their business to black people.China’s Open Door Policy is seen as a big step of indigenization for their economy, as it is opening its doors to the western world. This allowed different cultures to experience one another and opened up China’s businesses to the western world as well, which set China forth in a sort of economic reform.\n\nAnother big part of indigenization is social work, although it is unknown what the actual process is when social forces come into place. Indigenization is seen by some as less of a process of naturalization and more of a process of culturally relevant social work. While indigenization wasn’t the standard, it was a way to not only accustom others to a surrounding point of view, but also helping understand both where these people came from and also their heritage. However, some argue that while the indigenization of social work may work when it comes to foreigners being brought into Western cultures, it would not work as well non-Western cultures were those that were being taken in. They also argue that Western cultures seem to exaggerate the similarities and differences between Western and foreign cultures.\n\nThe Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act was passed by Zimbabwe Parliament in 2008. It is a set of regulations meant to regulate businesses, compelling foreign-owned firms to sell 51-percent of their business to blacks over the following years. Five-year jail terms are assigned to foreigners who do not submit an indigenisation plan or use locals as fronts for their businesses. The intent of the law is to ensure the country’s black members fulfill a more prominent role in the economy. Controversy rose over this intent, with opponents stating that the law will scare away foreign investors. Indigenous Zimbabweans are defined as \"any person who, before the 18th April, 1980 [when Zimbabwe gained independence from Britain], was disadvantaged by unfair discrimination on the grounds of his or her race, and any descendant of such person, and includes any company, association, syndicate or partnership of which indigenous Zimbabweans form the majority of the members or hold the controlling interest\".\n\nThis provision allows the minister of youth development, indigenization and economic empowerment, Saviour Kasukuwere, to keep a database of indigenous businesses from which foreign interest can pick partners from. At the time of the law passing, the ruling party in Zimbabwe was Zanu-PF, lead by the president Robert Mugabe. Saviour Kasukuwere is a member of this party, which brought up skepticism among economists who speculated that the database may be used by the party to give its allies the best deals. Mr. Kasukuwere stated that he will implement the law regardless of objections.\n\n"}

It is the main source of federal support for libraries and museums within the United States, having the mission to \"create strong libraries and museums that connect people with information and ideas.\" IMLS \"works at the national level and in coordination with state and local organizations to sustain heritage, culture, and knowledge; enhance learning and innovation; and support professional development.\" Their vision is \"a democratic society where communities and individuals thrive with broad public access to knowledge, cultural heritage, and lifelong learning.\" In fiscal year 2015, IMLS had a budget of $228 million.\n\nIn addition to its other responsibilities, the IMLS annually awards the National Medal for Museum and Library Service, the nation's highest award given for community service by libraries and museums.\n\nIMLS is located at 955 L’Enfant Plaza North, SW, Suite 4000, Washington, D.C. 20024-2135.\n\nIMLS was established by the Museum and Library Services Act (MLSA) on September 30, 1996, which includes the Library Services and Technology Act and the Museum Services Act. This act was reauthorized in 2003 and again in 2010. The law combined the Institute of Museum Services, which had been in existence since 1976, and the Library Programs Office, which had been part of the Department of Education since 1956. Lawmakers at that time saw “great potential in an Institute that is focused on the combined roles that libraries and museums play in our community life.”\n\nAs amended, MLSA authorizes IMLS to promote improvements in library services; to facilitate access to resources in libraries; to encourage resource sharing among libraries; to support museums in fulfilling their public service and educational roles; to encourage leadership and innovation to enhance museum services; to assist museums in the conservation of America's heritage; to support museums in achieving the highest standards of management and service to the public; and to support resource sharing among museums, libraries and other organizations. MLSA also authorizes IMLS to carry out and publish analyses of the impact of museum and library services.\n\nThe act comes up for reauthorization every 5 years. Adjustment to the act have been made over time.\n\nIn April 2014, Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) recommended that the federal government not fund MLSA and \"shift the federal agency’s responsibilities to the private sector in his 2015 fiscal year budget resolution\" such as \"funded at the state and local level and augmented significantly by charitable contributions from the private sector\".\n\nFollowing a proposal by President George W. Bush, the activities of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science was consolidated under IMLS, along with some of the activities of the National Center for Education Statistics, in order to create a unified body for federal support of library and information policy. The consolidation took effect in early 2008.\n\nWhen Congress passed the Library Services and Technology Act in 1996, it moved library responsibilities out of the Department of Education and created the IMLS as new agency. The act stipulated that the agency maintain a rotating directorship starting with the former director of the Institute of Museum Services for a four-year term. In the fifth year, the directorship would pass to a representative from the field of library and information science.\n\nDiane Frankel (1996) Prior to leading the agency through its transition to include federal library as well as museum programs, Frankel served as director of the Institute of Museum Services.\n\nRobert S. Martin (2001) Preceding his position at IMLS, Martin was a professor and interim director of the School of Library and Information Studies at Texas Woman's University. He also served as Director and Librarian of the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. He also articulated the convergence of new media in lifelong learning at the beginning of the millennium. \n\nAnne-Imelda Radice (2006) Previously served as chief of staff for the U.S. Department of Education and as curator in the Office of the Architect of the Capitol. She earned a bachelor's degree from Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts; a master's degree from Villa Schifanoia Graduate School of Fine Arts in Florence, Italy; a second master’s from American University in Washington, D.C.; and a Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nSusan H. Hildreth (2011) Began her career as a branch librarian at the Edison Township Library in New Jersey, where she was president of the Public Library Association. She has also been the city librarian in Seattle and state librarian of California. In addition, Hildreth was deputy director of San Francisco Public Library.\n\nDr. Kathryn K. Matthew (2015) A scientist with a 30-year museum career, Matthew’s experience includes curation, collections management, and research roles at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia and Cranbrook Institute of Science. Her experience includes fundraising and marketing roles at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, the Virginia Museum of Natural History, The Nature Conservancy, the Historic Charleston Foundation, and The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis. She was also executive director of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science.\n\n\nThe Institute of Museum and Library Services offers numerous grants for museums, libraries, and other cultural heritage institutions. The grants support the IMLS's strategic goals of advancing \"innovation, lifelong learning, and cultural and civic engagement.\" The grants include the following:\n\nThe Office of Impact Assessment and Learning (OIAL) \"supports the agency in its efforts to create strong libraries and museums that connect people to information and ideas.\" OIAL performs three key functions: policy research, evaluations, and survey and data collection.\n\n\n"}

With the aid of the technological mediation used in telecollaborative study, participants on each side of the network have cost-effective access to \"Languaculture.\"\n\nNumerous models and theories of intercultural communication have been proposed, including communication accommodation (Giles, 1973), cultural convergence (Barnett & Kincaid, 1983), identity or face negotiation theory (Ting-Toomey, 1993), and interactive acculturation (Bourhis, Moise, Perreault, & Senecal, 1997). A model of ICC (or IC) widely accepted in foreign language education has been proposed by Byram. This model includes five components, all of which are needed for a student to become an \"intercultural speaker\":\n\n\nThe benefits as well as the challenges of utilizing CSCL as a means of intercultural communication must be considered. Research in the field indicates several advantages, including:\n\n\nHowever, despite the potential advantages of using CSCL to overcome the barriers of face-to-face prejudice, develop social skills, and increase cognitive flexibility, simply adding CSCL to a communicative situation does not automatically foster trust nor resolve intercultural issues. In fact, research has indicated that some problems are made worse (or at least more obvious) by moving to a computer-supported medium:\n\n\nAlthough there are many benefits to using CSCL, especially in language learning contexts, teachers must approach its adoption with clear goals and objectives. Teachers should select the CSCL medium with careful consideration. In fact, tool selection is critical since different media work well for some people and not for others. In addition, instructors need to be familiar with concepts of intercultural communication in addition to CSCL. In terms of its application CSCL is not appropriate for short-term projects, and teachers should expect to spend a considerable amount of extra management time in roles such as mediators, monitors, and facilitators. Teachers who have little extra time should not implement CSCL.\n\nCSCL requires instructional scaffolding to accommodate different levels of foreign language ability as well as concrete and structured exercises that are built in during the team formation stage. Teachers may have to provide background information to extend their students' understanding of the target culture while also being unafraid to confront negative stereotypes that their students may possess. Despite these challenges, CSCL may prove to be a superior tool through which teachers can foster greater understanding between their students and members of other cultures.\n"}

It was woven in a tufted pattern suggesting overlapping petals or feathers, either by sewing tufts onto the garment or by weaving loops into the fabric.\n\nThe origin of this dress is traced to the Sumerian civilization which existed even before 4,000 BC. The Early Dynastic Period between 2,700 and 2,350 BC was marked by high culture. The dress was a unisex garment which both men and women wore. The skirt was made from sheepskin and was worn with the skin turned inside and with tufts ornamented like a toothed-comb over the wool. It was used in the form of a wraparound skirt tied and worn from the waist extending to the knees. Servants and soldiers wore the shortest garments, while persons of high status wore longer ones with the skirt often extending down to the ankles. The upper part of the body was either covered with another sheepskin cloak spread across the shoulders, or left bare. It was only around 2,500 BC that the sheepskin garment was replaced by a textile made of woven wool; however the tuft part of the dress was continued in the form of \"sewing tufts onto the garment or by weaving loops into the fabric\". The Greek called this dress kaunakes. This type of dress is featured in sculptures and mosaics of this period.\n\nIn a Sumerian image dated between 2,900 and 2,600 BC, the dress was worn as a pagne, which was a simple fleece pelt used as body wrap but retaining the tail part. In some images the wraparound covered the body crossed over the left shoulder. Following the discovery of weaving, kaunakes were designed with tufts of wool stitched into the cloth to \"simulate the curling fleece fur\". It was a rustic fabric made of sheepskin, camel or goat's hide fashioned in the form of a shawl or skirts called the \"thick blanket\" that evolved to suit the severe weather conditions of the Sumerian and Akkadian Mesopotamian region.\n\nIt is also believed that kaunakes, as a fashioned fleece, while not mentioned prior to 300 BC could be traced to the 400–300 BC. During the Greek period of Aristophanes the garment was made from goat’s hair or wool in the style of a weighty mantle or cape. Coptic Egypt, not Mesopotamia, is credited with the original design of woven tapestry with projecting long locks or strands of wool. Its manufacture evolved into kaunakes when the woven fringe design began to mirror the original fleece and fur and was shaped as a mantle. These were worn during the winter season as a shawl over the shoulders, and during summer adapted as a skirt. Over the centuries many designs evolved with sleeves, then variants were made with cloth instead of fleece, and eventually, it evolved back to a cape sans sleeves.\nIn Athens, initially the dress was thought to be of Persian origin but later it came to be identified as a Babylonian garment, as it matched with the textile practices of the northeast from Mesopotamia. Part of the confusion arose from the naming of the garment, because the root word is linguistically closer to Iranian language, rather than Babylonian language. The dress was also used by a stage actor in a drama scene of Aristophanes' \"Wasps\" in Athens, as the design of the exotic dress suited the dramatic effect in view of it being \"visually distinctive\", heavy and with small decorative tufts. It was the Athenians' belief that the kaunakes was of Persian origin and not from Babylon from an understanding that the dress was an exported item and could have originated from Anatolia (Kilikia or Phrygia), the Levant (Phoenicia or Syria), or Mesopotamia (Babylon), which were all part of the Persian Empire in the fifth century BC.\n\nAn image dated to about 3rd millennium BC from the Temple of Ishtar at Mari, Tell Hariri, in Syria shows kaunakes wrapped as a cloak around the shoulders of an alabaster image of a woman in a seated posture; the kaunakes is inferred as made from goat hair or wool. From 2,450 BC it was a royal dress, as seen from the figures in prayer mode in Mesopotamia. In this, the dress was formed with woolly tufts laid successively in horizontal lines and suspended vertically. It was fashioned generally as a woman's dress, adorning the left arm and shoulder with the right side exposing the skin and the breast.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18461", "title": "Leda and the Swan", "text": "Leda and the Swan\n\nLeda and the Swan is a story and subject in art from Greek mythology in which the god Zeus, in the form of a swan, seduces the mortal woman Leda. According to later Greek mythology, Leda bore Helen and Polydeuces, children of Zeus, while at the same time bearing Castor and Clytemnestra, children of her husband Tyndareus, the King of Sparta. In the W. B. Yeats version, it is subtly suggested that Clytemnestra, although being the daughter of Tyndareus, has somehow been traumatized by what the swan has done to her mother (see below). According to many versions of the story, Zeus took the form of a swan and seduced Leda on the same night she slept with her husband King Tyndareus. In some versions, she laid two eggs from which the children hatched. In other versions, Helen is a daughter of Nemesis, the goddess who personified the disaster that awaited those suffering from the pride of Hubris.\n\nThe subject was rarely seen in the large-scale sculpture of antiquity, although a representation of Leda in sculpture has been attributed in modern times to Timotheus (\"compare illustration, below left\"); small-scale sculptures survive showing both reclining and standing poses, in cameos and engraved gems, rings, and terracotta oil lamps. Recently, an ancient fresco depicting Leda and the Swan was found at the Pompeii archeological site in Italy. Thanks to the literary renditions of Ovid and Fulgentius it was a well-known myth through the Middle Ages, but emerged more prominently as a classicizing theme, with erotic overtones, in the Italian Renaissance.\n\nThe subject undoubtedly owed its sixteenth-century popularity to the paradox that it was considered more acceptable to depict a woman in the act of copulation with a swan than with a man. The earliest depictions show the pair love-making with some explicitness—more so than in any depictions of a human pair made by artists of high quality in the same period.\nThe fate of the erotic album \"I Modi\" some years later shows why this was so. The theme remained a dangerous one in the Renaissance, as the fates of the three best known paintings on the subject demonstrate. The earliest depictions were all in the more private medium of the old master print, and mostly from Venice. They were often based on the extremely brief account in the \"Metamorphoses\" of Ovid (who does not imply a rape), though Lorenzo de' Medici had both a Roman sarcophagus and an antique carved gem of the subject, both with reclining Ledas.\n\nThe earliest known explicit Renaissance depiction is one of the many woodcut illustrations to \"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\", a book published in Venice in 1499. This shows Leda and the Swan making love with gusto, despite being on top of a triumphal car, being pulled along and surrounded by a considerable crowd. An engraving dating to 1503 at the latest, by Giovanni Battista Palumba, also shows the couple in coitus, but in deserted countryside. Another engraving, certainly from Venice and attributed by many to Giulio Campagnola, shows a love-making scene, but there Leda's attitude is highly ambiguous. Palumba made another engraving, perhaps in about 1512, presumably influenced by Leonardo's sketches for his earlier composition, showing Leda seated on the ground and playing with her children.\n\nThere were also significant depictions in the smaller decorative arts, also private media. Benvenuto Cellini made a medallion, now in Vienna, early in his career, and Antonio Abondio one on the obverse of a medal celebrating a Roman courtesan.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci began making studies in 1504 for a painting, apparently never executed, of Leda seated on the ground with her children. In 1508 he painted a different composition of the subject, with a nude standing Leda cuddling the Swan, with the two sets of infant twins (also nude), and their huge broken egg-shells. The original of this is lost, probably deliberately destroyed, and was last recorded in the French royal Château de Fontainebleau in 1625 by Cassiano dal Pozzo. However it is known from many copies, of which the earliest are probably the \"Spiridon Leda\", perhaps by a studio assistant and now in the Uffizi, and the one at Wilton House in England (illustrated).\n\nAlso lost, and probably deliberately destroyed, is Michelangelo's tempera painting of the pair making love, commissioned in 1529 by Alfonso d'Este for his palazzo in Ferrara, and taken to France for the royal collection in 1532; it was at Fontainebleau in 1536. Michelangelo's cartoon for the work—given to his assistant Antonio Mini, who used it for several copies for French patrons before his death in 1533—survived for over a century. This composition is known from many copies, including an by Cornelis Bos, c. 1563; the marble sculpture by Bartolomeo Ammanati in the Bargello, Florence; two copies by the young Rubens on his Italian voyage, and the painting after Michelangelo, ca. 1530, in the National Gallery, London. The Michelangelo composition, of about 1530, shows Mannerist tendencies of elongation and twisted pose (the \"figura serpentinata\") that were popular at the time. In addition, a sculptural group, similar to the Prado Roman group illustrated, was believed until at least the 19th century to be by Michelangelo.\n\nThe last very famous Renaissance painting of the subject is Correggio's elaborate composition of c. 1530 (Berlin); this too was damaged whilst in the collection of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, the Regent of France in the minority of Louis XV. His son Louis, though a great lover of painting, had periodic crises of conscience about his way of life, in one of which he attacked the figure of Leda with a knife. The damage has been repaired, though full restoration to the original condition was not possible. Both the Leonardo and Michelangelo paintings also disappeared when in the collection of the French Royal Family, and are believed to have been destroyed by more moralistic widows or successors of their owners.\n\nThere were many other depictions in the Renaissance, including cycles of book illustrations to Ovid, but most were derivative of the compositions mentioned above. The subject remained largely confined to Italy, and sometimes France – Northern versions are rare. After something of a hiatus in the 18th and early 19th centuries (apart from a very sensuous Boucher,), Leda and the Swan became again a popular motif in the later 19th and 20th centuries, with many Symbolist and Expressionist treatments.\n\nAlso from that era were sculptures of the theme by Antonin Mercié and Max Klinger.\n\nCy Twombly executed an abstract version of \"Leda and the Swan\" in 1962. It was purchased by Larry Gagosian for $52.9 million at Christie's May 2017 Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale.\n\nAvant-garde filmmaker Kurt Kren along with other members of the Viennese Actionist movement, including Otto Muehl and Hermann Nitsch, made a film-performance called \"7/64 Leda mit der Schwan\" in 1964. The film retains the classical motif, portraying, for most of its duration, a young woman embracing a swan.\n\nPhotographer Charlie White included a portrait of Leda in his \"And Jeopardize the Integrity of the Hull\" series. Zeus, as the swan, only appears metaphorically.\n\nThere is a life-sized marble statue of \"Leda and the Swan\" at the Jai Vilas Palace Museum in Gwalior, Northern Madhya Pradesh, India.\n\nAmerican artist and photographer Carole Harmel created the “Bird” series (1983), a Jean Cocteau-influenced collection of photographs that explored the “Leda and the Swan” myth in tightly cropped, voyeuristic images of a nude female and an undefinable birdlike creature hinting at intimacy. \n\nBristol Museum and Art Gallery currently exhibits Karl Weschke's \"Leda and the Swan\", painted in 1986.\n\nThe Winnipeg Art Gallery in Canada has, in its permanent collection, a ceramic \"Leda and the Swan\" by Japanese-born American artist Akio Takamori.\n\nThere is a sculpture in neon lights depicting Leda and the Swan in Berlin, near Sonnenallee metro station and the Estrel hotel, opposite Griessmühle.\n\nRonsard wrote a poem on \"La Défloration de Lède\", perhaps inspired by the Michelangelo, which he may well have known. Like many artists, he imagines the beak penetrating Leda's vagina.\n\n\"Leda and the Swan\" is a sonnet by William Butler Yeats first published in the \"Dial\" in 1923. Combining psychological realism with a mystic vision, it describes the swan's rape of Leda. It also alludes to the Trojan war, which will be provoked by the abduction of Helen, who will be begotten by Zeus on Leda (along with Castor and Pollux, in some versions of the myth). Clytaemnestra, who killed her husband, Agamemnon, leader of the Greeks at Troy, was also supposed to have hatched from one of Leda's eggs. The poem is regularly praised as one of Yeats's masterpieces. Camille Paglia, said the poem \"could justifiably be considered the best of the twentieth century,\" and that \"all human beings, like Leda, are caught up moment by moment in the 'white rush' of experience. For Yeats, the only salvation is the shapeliness and stillness of art.\" See external links for a bas relief arranged in the position as described by Yeats.\n\nNicaraguan poet Rubén Darío's 1892 poem \"Leda\" contains an oblique description of the rape, watched over by the god Pan.\n\nH.D. (Hilda Doolittle) also wrote a poem called \"Leda\" in 1919, suggested to be from the perspective of Leda. The description of the sexual action going on makes it seem almost beautiful, as if Leda had given her consent.\n\nIn the song \"Power and Glory\" from Lou Reed's 1992 album \"Magic and Loss\", Reed recalls the experience of seeing his friend dying of cancer and makes reference to the myth, \"I saw isotopes introduced into his lungs / trying to stop the cancerous spread / And it made me think of Leda and The Swan / and gold being made from lead\"\n\nSylvia Plath alludes to the myth in her radio play \"Three Women\" written for the BBC in 1962. The play features the voices of three women. The first is a married woman who keeps her baby. The second is a secretary who suffers a miscarriage. The third voice, a girl who is pregnant and leaves her baby, mentions \"the great swan, with its terrible look,/ Coming at me,\" insinuating that the girl was raped. The play is about the disconnection of women in society and challenges societal expectations of childbirth.\n\nSeveral references to the myth are presented in novels by Angela Carter, including \"Nights at the Circus\" and \"The Magic Toyshop\". In the latter novel, the myth is brought to life in the form of a performance in which a frightened young girl is forced to act as Leda in accompaniment with a large mechanical swan.\n\nThere is a reference to Leda and the Swan in Dorothea Benton Frank's book \"All Summer Long\" published in 2016.\n\nA version of the Leda and the Swan story is the foundation myth in the Canadian futuristic thriller television series \"Orphan Black\" which aired over 5 seasons from 2013 to 2017. A corporation uses genetic engineering to create a series of female clones (Leda) and a series of male clones (Castor) who are also brothers and sisters clones as they derive from one mother who is a chimera with male and female genomes. The award-winning show addresses issues of the modern science of genetics, corporate greed, the ethics of human cloning, human longevity and the nature of individuality. Actress Tatiana Maslany won an Emmy award for her portrayal of all Leda clones, often together in the same scene. The television show spawned a comic book series which appeared in 2015.\n\nIn April 2012 an art gallery in London, England, was instructed by the police to remove a modern exhibit of Leda and the Swan. The law concerned was Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, brought in by the Labour Party government of 2005–2010.\n\n\n"}

The inaugural march was held on April 22, 2017 in Washington, D.C., and more than 600 other cities across the world. According to organizers, the march is a non-partisan movement to celebrate science and the role it plays in everyday lives. The goals of the marches and rallies were to emphasize that science upholds the common good and to call for evidence-based policy in the public's best interest. The March for Science organizers, using crowd science techniques, estimated global attendance at 1.07 million, with 100,000 participants estimated for the main March in Washington, D.C., 70,000 in Boston, 60,000 in Chicago, 50,000 in Los Angeles, 50,000 in San Francisco, 14,000 in Phoenix, and 11,000 in Berlin.\n\nOrganizers announced plans for a second March for Science to be held April 14, 2018. More than 70 satellite events around the world have already registered to participate in the 2nd annual event, including New York City, Abuja, Nigeria, Baraut, India\n\nThe March for Science organizers and supporters say that support for science should be nonpartisan. The march is being organized by scientists skeptical of the agenda of the Trump administration, and critical of Trump administration policies widely viewed as hostile to science. The march's website states that an \"American government that ignores science to pursue ideological agendas endangers the world.\"\n\nParticular issues of science policy raised by the marchers include support for evidence-based policymaking, as well as support for government funding for scientific research, government transparency, and government acceptance of the scientific consensus on climate change and evolution. The march is part of growing political activity by American scientists in the wake of the November 2016 elections and the 2017 Women's March.\n\nRobert N. Proctor, a historian of science at Stanford University, stated that the March for Science was \"pretty unprecedented in terms of the scale and breadth of the scientific community that's involved\" and was rooted in \"a broader perception of a massive attack on sacred notions of truth that are sacred to the scientific community.\"\n\nIn 2012, Donald Trump referred to climate change as a hoax. As a presidential candidate, he promised to resume construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline and roll back U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations adopted by the Obama administration.\n\nAfter Trump's election, his transition team sought out specific U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) employees who had worked on climate change during the Obama administration. Prior to Trump's inauguration, many climate scientists began downloading climate data from government websites that they feared might be deleted by the Trump administration. Other actions taken or promised by the Trump administration inspired the march, including pulling out of the Paris Agreement, the stances of his Cabinet nominees, the freezing of research grants, and a gag order placed on scientists in the EPA regarding dissemination of their research findings. In February 2017, William Happer, a possible Trump science advisor with skeptical views on human caused global warming, described an area of climate science as \"really more like a cult\" and its practitioners \"glassy-eyed\". \"ScienceInsider\" reported Trump's first budget request as \"A grim budget day for U.S. science\" because it contained major funding cuts to NOAA's research and satellite programs, the EPA's Office of Research and Development, the DOE's Office of Science and energy programs, the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Institutes of Health, and other science agencies.\n\nInternational sister marches were planned for countries around the world. These both supported American scientists and climate scientists more generally, and protested against other impingements on academic freedom internationally, such as government action against the Central European University in Hungary and the closure of educational institutes and dismissal of academics in the 2016–17 Turkish purges, as well as local issues.\n\nA major source of inspiration behind the planning of the march was the 2017 Women's March of January 21, 2017. The specific idea to create a march originated from a Reddit discussion thread about the removal of references to climate change from the White House website. In the discussion, an anonymous poster named \"Beaverteeth92\" made a comment regarding the need for a \"Scientist's March on Washington\". Dozens of Reddit users responded positively to the proposal. Jonathan Berman, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas Health Science Center and a participant in the original conversation, created a Facebook page, Twitter feed and website to organize a march. The Facebook group grew from 200 members to 300,000 in less than a week, growing to 800,000 members. Individual scientists have both applauded and criticized this development. \n\nIt was announced on March 30 that Bill Nye, Mona Hanna-Attisha, and Lydia Villa-Komaroff would headline the march, and serve as honorary co-chairs. The protest was set to occur on Earth Day, with satellite rallies planned in hundreds of cities across the world.\n\nDuring the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the largest scientific organization in the US, scientists held the \"Rally to Stand Up for Science\" at Copley Square, Boston, on February 19. The same month, the AAAS announced its support for the march. By mid-March, some 100 science organizations endorsed the March for Science, including many scientific societies. Endorsers of the march included the American Geophysical Union, American Association of Geographers, American Association of Physical Anthropologists, Society for Neuroscience, Society for Freshwater Science, American Statistical Association, Association for Psychological Science, American Sociological Association, Electrochemical Society, Entomological Society of America, California Academy of Sciences, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium.\n\nThe University of Delaware Center for Political Communication conducted a survey of 1,040 members of March for Science Facebook groups or pages from March 31 to April 18 to study their motivations for joining the march. Respondents cited the following as reasons for marching:\n\nBefore April, enthusiasts found existing knitting patterns for a hat shaped like a brain and proposed it as a symbol of solidarity for the march in analogy with the pussyhat project.\n\nThe primary march in Washington, D.C. began at 10 AM with a rally and teach-in on the grounds of the Washington Monument, featuring speeches by concerned citizens alternating with scientists and engineers; including Denis Hayes, co-founder of the first Earth Day in 1970 and Bill Nye. No politicians spoke at the rally. At 2 PM the crowd of thousands, in spite of the steady rain throughout the day, proceeded down Constitution Avenue to 3rd Street, NW between the National Mall and the west front of the United States Capitol.\n\nProtesters gathered in over a hundred cities across the globe, with an estimated 70,000 participants in Boston, Massachusetts, and over 150,000 in several cities in California.\n\nProfessor Robert Proctor of Stanford University said that the March for Science was similar to other efforts by scientists such as Physicians for Social Responsibility; however, the scale was larger because \"there's a broader perception of a massive attack on sacred notions of truth that are sacred to the scientific community.\"\n\"Science not Silence: Voices from the March for Science Movement\" Edited by Stephanie Fine Sasse and Lucky Tran. Published 2018 by The MIT Press. 176pp.\n\nOn January 26, 2017, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont expressed his support for the march, congratulating \"those scientists and researchers who are fighting back\". U.S. Representative Bill Foster of Illinois, a physicist and the only current member of Congress with a Ph.D. in a natural sciences field, will join the march, \"not as a Democratic member of Congress, but as a scientist.\" Foster said that he viewed the march as political, but not partisan, saying, \"if you see a specific policy that is inconsistent with the known principles of science, every citizen who is also a scientist should speak out.\"\n\nIn February the AAAS and other science groups announced their support for the march. Rush Holt Jr., the chief executive officer of the AAAS, expressed support for scientist involvement in politics. Holt also emphasizes the importance of \"appreciation for and understanding of science in the general population\".\n\nThe march received a torrent of criticism from conservative publications for the perceived left-wing bias and orientation of the event. A number of scientists voiced concerns over the march. Sylvester James Gates warned that \"such a politically charged event might send a message to the public that scientists are driven by ideology more than by evidence\". Climate change denier William Happer stated that \"there's no reason to assume the president is against science\" while regarding the march. Writing in the \"New York Times\", Robert S. Young argued that the march will \"reinforce the narrative from skeptical conservatives that scientists are an interest group and politicize their data, research and findings for their own ends\" and that it would be better for scientists to \"march into local civic groups, churches, county fairs and, privately, into the offices of elected officials.\" Matthew Nisbet writing for \"Skeptical Inquirer\" magazine right after the first march in 2017, states that it isn't the least educated but the \"best educated and most scientifically literate who are prone to biased reasoning and false beliefs about contentious science issues\". In his opinion this will mean that the March will only deepen \"partisan differences, while jeopardizing trust and impartiality and credibility of scientists\". Regardless of assurances by the March's organizers that this would be non-political, it clearly was. Nisbet feels that confidence in scientists is strong, and they should \"use this capital wisely and effectively\".\n\nResponding to criticism surrounding the political nature of the march, meteorologist and columnist Eric Holthaus wrote that the scientific field \"has always been political\" and referred to the example of Galileo Galilei's confrontation with the political order. Holthaus wrote that the scientists must also protest when \"truth itself is being called into question\".\n\nDiscussing science’s role in policy and government, Rush Holt points out a fallacy in viewing science and politics as philosophically incompatible: \"The ethic in the profession is that you stick to your science, and if you’re interested in how science affects public policy or public questions, just let the facts speak for themselves. Of course, there’s a fallacy there, too. Facts are, by themselves, voiceless.\"\n\nSan Francisco Lead Organizer Kristen Ratan debated Jerry Coyne on KQED's Forum regarding his criticism of the March and remarked that the millennial generation is just finding its feet with regard to activism and should be encouraged. Ratan also distinguished between being political and being partisan and suggested that while the March for Science is a political act, it is by no means partisan, which implies blind allegiance to one party over another. Ratan reiterated that the March For Science supports evidence-based policy-making regardless of party or affiliation.\n\nFollowing the march, the organizers of the March for Science encouraged people to a \"Week of Action\" with an outline of daily actions.\n\n"}

The concept, regulation and classification of middle schools, as well as the ages covered, vary between, and sometimes within, countries.\n\nIn Afghanistan, middle school consists of grades 6, 7 and 8.\n\nIn Albania, middle school is included in the primary education which lasts 9 years and attendance is mandatory.\n\nIn Algeria, a middle school includes 4 grades; 6, 7, 8 and 9 consisting of students from ages 11 to 14 or 12 to 15.\n\nThe \"ciclo básico\" of secondary education (ages 12–16) is roughly equivalent to middle school.\n\nMost regions of Australia do not have middle schools, as students go directly from primary school (for years K–6) to secondary school (years 7-12, usually referred to as high school).\n\nAs an alternative to the middle school model, some secondary schools divided their grades into \"junior high school\" (years 7, 8, 9 and 10) and \"senior high school\" (years 11 and 12). Some have three levels, \"junior\" (years 7 and 8), \"intermediate\" (years 9 and 10), and \"senior\" (years 11 and 12).\n\nIn 1996 and 1997, a national conference met to develop what became known as the National Middle Schooling Project, which aimed to develop a common Australian view of\nThe first middle school established in Australia was The Armidale School, in Armidale (approximately north of Sydney, SSW of Brisbane and approximately due west of Coffs Harbour on the coast). Other schools have since followed this trend.\n\nThe Northern Territory has introduced a three tier system featuring Middle Schools for years 7–9 (approximate age 13–15) and high school year 10–12 (approximate age 16–18).\n\nMany schools across Queensland have introduced a Middle School tier within their schools. The middle schools cover years 6 to 8.\n\nIn Bangladesh, middle school is not separated like other countries. Generally schools are from class 1 to class 10. It means lower primary (1-5), upper primary (6-10). From class 6-8 is thought as middle school. Grades 1,2,3,4 and 5 are said to be primary school while all the classes from 6 to 9 are considered high school (as middle school and high school are not considered separate) while 10-12 is called college.\n\nThere aren't middle schools in Bolivia since 1994. Students aged 11–15 attend the last years of elementary education or the first years of secondary education.\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina \"middle school\" refers to educational institutions for ages between 14 and 18, and lasts 3–4 years, following elementary school (which lasts 8 or 9 years). \"Gymnasiums\" are the most prestigious type of \"middle\" school.\n\nIn Brazil, middle school is a mandatory stage that precedes High School (\"Ensino Médio\") called \"Ensino Fundamental II\" consisting of grades 6 to 9, ages 11 to 14.\n\nIn Canada, the terms \"Middle School\" and \"Junior High School\" are both used, depending on which grades the school caters to. Junior high schools tend to include only grades 7, 8, and sometimes 9 (some older schools with the name 'carved in concrete' still use \"Junior High\" as part of their name, although grade nine is now missing), whereas middle schools are usually grades 6–8 or only grades 7-8 or 6-7 (i.e. around ages 11–14), varying from area to area and also according to population vs. building capacity. Another common model is grades 5–8. Alberta, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island junior high schools (the term \"Middle School\" is not commonly used) include only grades 7–9, with the first year of high school traditionally being grade 10. In some places students go from elementary school to secondary school. In Ontario, the term \"Middle School and Secondary School are used).\n\nQuebec uses a grade system that is different from those of the other provinces. The Secondary level has five grades, starting after Elementary Grade 6. These are called Secondary I to Secondary V.\n\nThere aren't middle schools in Chile. Students aged 11 to 16 attend the last years of \"educación básica\" (basic education, until age 14) or the first years of \"educación media\" (middle education, equivalent to middle and high school).\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, middle school has two stages, junior stage (grades 7–9, some places are grades 6–9) and senior stage (grades 10–12). The junior stage education is the last 3 years of 9-year-compulsory education for all young citizens; while the senior stage education is optional but considered as a critical preparation for college education. Some middle schools have both stages while some have either of them.\n\nThe admissions for most students to enroll in senior middle schools from junior stage are on the basis of the scores that they get in \"Senior Middle School Entrance Exam\", which are held by local governments. Other students may bypass the exam, based on their distinctive talents, like athletics, or excellent daily performance in junior stage.\n\nSecondary education is divided into basic secondary (grades 6 to 9) and mid-secondary (grades 10 and 11). The students in basic secondary, roughly equivalent to middle school, are 11 or 12 to 15 or 16 years old.\n\nIn Croatia \"middle school\" refers to educational institutions for ages between 14 and 18, and lasts 3–5 years, following elementary school (which lasts 8 years). \"Gymnasiums\" are the most prestigious type of \"middle\" school.\n\n\"Secundaria básica\" (basic secondary, seventh through ninth grades) is the approximate equivalent of middle school in Cuba.\n\nIn the Czech Republic after completing the nine-year elementary school (compulsory school attendance) a student may apply for high school or gymnasium.\n\nStudents have the opportunity to enroll in high school from Grade 5 or (less commonly) Grade 7 of elementary school, spending eight or six years respectively at high school that otherwise takes four years. Thus they can spend five years in elementary school, followed by eight in high school. The first four years of eight-year study program at high school are comparable with junior high school. Gymnasium focuses on a more advanced academic approach to education. All other types of high schools except gymnasiums and conservatories (e.g. lyceums) accept only students that finished Grade 9.\n\nThe 4th and last level of \"educación general básica\" (ages 12–14) is roughly equivalent to middle school.\n\nIn Egypt, middle school precedes high school. It is called the preparatory stage and consists of three phases: first preparatory in which students study more subjects than primary with different branches. For instance, algebra and geometry are taught instead of \"mathematics.\" In the second preparatory phase, students study science, geography, the history of Egypt starting with pharaonic history, including Coptic history, Islamic history, and concluding with modern history. The students are taught two languages, Arabic and English. Middle school (preparatory stage) lasts for three years.\n\nIn France, the equivalent period to middle school is collège, which lasts four years from the (\"sixth\", the equivalent of the Canadian and American Grade 6) to the (\"third\", the equivalent of the Canadian and American Grade 9), accommodating pupils aged between 11 and 15. Upon completion of the latter, students are awarded a Brevet des collèges if they obtain a certain amount of points on a series of tests in various subjects (French, history / geography, mathematics, science / physics / chemistry), but also on a series of skills completed during the last year and on oral examinations (e.g., about cross-subjects themes they work on the latest years, the fourth year of collège). They can then enter high school (called \"lycée\"), which lasts three years from the to the until the \"baccalauréat\", and during which they can choose a general or a professional field of study.\n\nIn Georgia, equivalent period to middle school covers ages 12 to 15, from the 7th grade to the 10th and guarantees basic educational degree certificate. \n\nThere are four middle schools in Gibraltar, following the English model of middle-deemed-primary schools accommodating pupils aged between 9 and 12 (National Curriculum Years 4 to 7). The schools were opened in 1972 when the government introduced comprehensive education in the country.\n\nIn Greece, the equivalent period to middle school is call Gymnasium (Γυμνάσιο), which caters to children between the ages 13 and 15, i.e. 7th, 8th and 9th grade.\n\nCBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) classifies Middle School as Upper Primary (Class 5 – 8)\n\nThere are other Central Boards / Councils such as CISCE (Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination).\n\nEach state has its own State Board. Each has its own standards, which might be different from the Central Boards.\n\nIn some institutions, providing education for 5th to 10th are known as secondary school.\n\nThe standard of naming school sections are:-\n\nPre-Primary - Nursery to KG\n\nPrimary - Classes I to IV\n\nMiddle School - Classes V to VIII\n\nHigh school - Classes IX to X\n\nInter college - Classes XI to XII\n\nIn Indonesia, middle school () covers ages 12 to 14 or class 7 to class 9.\n\nAlthough compulsory education ends at junior high, most pursue higher education. There are around 22,000 middle schools in Indonesia with a balanced ownership between public and private sector.\n\nIran calls Middle School Secondary School, which caters to children between the ages 12 and 15, i.e. 7th, 8th and 9th grade.\n\nIn most of the cities in Israel, middle school (Hebrew: חטיבת ביניים, \"Khativat Beynaiym\") covers ages 12 to 15. From the 7th grade to the 9th.\n\nIn Italy the equivalent is the \"scuola secondaria di primo grado\" formerly and commonly called \"middle lower school\" (Scuola Media Inferiore), often shortened to \"middle school\" (Scuola Media). When the \"Scuola secondaria di secondo grado\", the equivalent of high school, was formerly called \"middle higher school\" (Scuola Media Superiore), commonly called \"Superiori\". The Middle School lasts three years from the student age of 11 to age 14. Since 2009, after \"Gelmini reform\", the middle school was renamed \"Scuola secondaria di primo grado\" (\"junior secondary school\").\n\nMiddle school in Jamaica is called a Junior High School. It is from grade 7- 9 but this idea is becoming rare now so grades 7- 9 is considered lower secondary.\n\nJunior high schools (中学校 \"chūgakkō\") are for children aged twelve through fifteen years old.\n\nIn Kosovo \"middle school\" refers to educational institutions for ages between 14 and 18, and lasts 3–4 years, following elementary school (which lasts 8 or 9 years). \"Gymnasiums\" are the most prestigious type of \"middle\" school.\n\nIn Kuwait, middle school is from grade 6-9 and from age 11-14.\n\nIn Lebanon, middle school or intermediate school consists of grades 7, 8, and 9. At the end of 9th grade, the student is given the National diploma examination.\n\nIn Macedonia \"middle school\" refers to educational institutions for ages between 14 and 18, and lasts 3–4 years, following elementary school (which lasts 8 or 9 years). \"Gymnasiums\" are the most prestigious type of \"middle\" school.\n\nIn Malaysia, the middle school equivalent is called lower secondary school which consists of students from age 13 to 15 (Form 1-3). Usually, these lower secondary schools are combined with upper secondary schools to form a single secondary school which is also known as high school. Students at the end of their lower secondary studies are required to sit for an examination called PT3 (Form 3. 7 subjects for non-Muslim students and 8 subjects for Muslim students) in order to determine their field of studies for upper secondary (Form 4-5). \n\nIn Mexico, the middle school system is called \"Secundaria\" and usually comprises three years, grades 7–9 (ages: 7: 12–13, 8: 13–14, 9: 14–15). It is completed after \"Primaria\" (Elementary School, up to grade 6: ages 6–12) and before \"Preparatoria/Bachillerato\" (High School, grades 10–12 ages 15–18).\n\nIn Montenegro \"middle school\" refers to educational institutions for ages between 14 and 18, and lasts 3–4 years, following elementary school (which lasts 8 or 9 years). \"Gymnasiums\" are the most prestigious type of \"middle\" school.\n\nIn New Zealand middle schools are known as intermediate schools. They generally cover years 7 and 8 (formerly known as Forms 1 to 2). Students are generally aged between 10 and 13. There are full primary schools which also contain year 7 and 8 with students continuing to high school at year 9 (formerly known as Form 3). Some high schools also include years 7 and 8.\n\nAfter 2000 there was an increased interest in middle schooling (for years 7–10) with at least seven schools offering education to this age group opening around the country in Auckland, Cambridge, Hamilton, Christchurch and Upper Hutt.\n\nIn Pakistan, middle school (Class 1 – 8) is a combination of primary (Class 1 – 5) and middle (Class 6 – 8).\n\nThere aren't middle schools in Peru. Students aged 12 to 15 attend the first years of \"educación secundaria\" (secondary school.)\n\nSince the implementation of the K–12 education system, middle school education in the Philippines is called \"Junior High School\". It lasts for 4 years from Grades 7 to 10 for students age 12 to 16. Some schools, such as Miriam College in Loyola Heights as well as Lourdes School of Quezon City in Sta. Mesa Heights, have their Middle Schools from Grades 6 to 8. It is preceded by a 6-year elementary school and followed by a 2-year \"senior high school\" program.\n\nBefore that, there were no official middle school programs implemented and the equivalent years was simply called \"High School\" which ranged from First Year to Fourth Year.\n\nMiddle school in Poland, called \"gimnazjum\", was first introduced in 1932. The education was intended for pupils of at least 12 years of age and lasted four years. Middle schools were part of the educational system until the reform of 1947, except during World War II.\n\nThe middle schools were reinstated in Poland in 1999 now lasting three years after six years of primary school. Pupils entering \"gimnazjum\" are usually 13 years old. Middle school is compulsory for all students, and it is also the final stage of mandatory education. In the final year students take a standardized test to evaluate their academic skills. Higher scorers in the test are allowed first pick of school if they want to continue their education, which is encouraged.\n\nStarting with the school year 2017/18, middle schools are scheduled to be disbanded and primary schools to be extended to lasting eight years, as it was before 1999.\n\nIn Portugal, the middle school is known as 2nd and 3rd cycles of basic education (\"2º e 3º ciclos do ensino básico\"). It comprises the 5th till 9th year of compulsory education, for children between ten and fifteen years old. After the education reform of 1986, the former preparatory school (\"escola preparatória\") and the first three years of the \"liceu\", became part of basic education (\"educação básica\").\n\nBasic education now includes:\n\nMiddle school in Romania, or gymnasium (\"gimnaziu\"), includes grades 5 to 8 and the students usually share the building with the students of primary school but in different wings/floors. Primary school lessons are taught by a handful of teachers: most are covered by one of them, and more specific areas such as foreign languages, religion or gym may have dedicated teachers. The transition to middle school changes that to a one teacher per course model where the students usually remain in the same classroom while the teachers rotate between courses. At the end of the eighth grade (usually corresponding to age 14 or 15), students take a written exam that counts for 80% (before, it used to be 50%) of the average needed to enroll in high school. Students then go to high school or vocational school, depending on their final grade.\nSchooling is compulsory until the tenth grade (which corresponds with the age of 16 or 17).The education process is done in numbered semesters, the first semester lasting 19 weeks between September and February and the second semester lasting 16 weeks between February and June.\n\nMiddle school in Russia covers grades 5 to 9, and is a natural continuation of primary school activities (almost always they are in the same building with both primary and high school, usually located in different wings/floors). Primary school lessons are taught by a handful of teachers: most are covered by one of them, and more specific areas such as English or gym may have dedicated teachers. The transition to middle school changes that to a one teacher per course model, where teachers stay in their classrooms and pupils change rooms during breaks. Examples of courses include mathematics (split from grade 7 into algebra, geometry and physics), visual arts, Russian language, foreign language, history, literature, geography, biology, computer science, chemistry (from grade 8), social theory (in grade 9). The education process is done in numbered quarters, with the first quarter covering September and October, second quarter November and December, third quarter going from mid January to mid March, fourth quarter covering April and May. There are one week long holidays between quarters 1 and 2 as well as 3 and 4, somewhat longer holidays between quarters 2 and 3 to allow for New Year festivities, and a three-month break between the years. At the end of middle school most people stay in school for two more years and get a certificate allowing them to pursue university, but some switch to vocational-technical schools.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, middle school includes grade 7 through 9, consisting of students from ages 12 to 15.\n\nIn Serbia \"middle school\" refers to educational institutions for ages between 14 and 18, and lasts 3–4 years, following elementary school (which lasts 8 or 9 years). \"Gymnasiums\" are the most prestigious type of \"middle\" school.\n\nIn Singapore, middle school is usually referred to as secondary school. Students start secondary school after completing primary school at the age of 13, and to 16 (four years if they are taking the Special, Express or Normal Technical courses), or 17 (five years if they are taking the Normal Academic courses). Students from the Special and Express courses take the GCE 'O' Levels after four years at the end of secondary education, and students from the Normal (Academic and Technical) courses take the GCE 'N' Level examinations after four years, and the Normal Academic students has the option to continue for the 'O' Levels. Selected excelling students also have the option to change classes which then affect the years they study. After completing secondary school, students move on to pre-tertiary education (i.e. in institutes such as junior colleges, polytechnics, ITE).\n\nIn Slovenia \"middle school\" refers to educational institutions for ages between 14 and 18, and lasts 3–4 years, following elementary school (which lasts 8 or 9 years). \"Gymnasiums\" are the most prestigious type of \"middle\" school.\n\nIn Somalia, middle school identified as intermediate school is the four years between secondary school and primary school. Pupils start middle school from form as referred to in Somalia or year 5 and finish it at year 8. Students start middle school from the age of 11 and finish it when they are 14–15. Subjects, which middle school pupils take are: Somali, Arabic, English, Religion, Science, Geography, History, Math, Textiles, Art and Design, Physical Education (PE) (Football) and sometimes Music. In some middle schools, it is obligatory to study Italian.\n\nIn South Korea, a middle school is called a \"jung hakgyo\" (Hangul: 중학교; Hanja: ) which includes grades 7 through 9 (referred to as: middle school 1st–3rd grades; approx. age 13–15).\n\nIn Spain, education is compulsory for children between 6 and 16 years. Basic education is divided into \"Educación Primaria\" (first grade through sixth grade), which is the Spanish equivalent of elementary school; and \"Educación Secundaria Obligatoria\" or \"ESO\" (seventh through tenth grade), roughly the Spanish equivalent of middle school and (partially) high school. The usual ages in ESO are 12 to 15 years old, but they can range between 11 and 16 depending on the birth date (a student who was born late in the year may start ESO at 11 if he or she will turn 12 before January 1st, and a student who was born early in the year may finish ESO after turning 16).\n\nAfter ESO, students can continue their pre-university education attending to \"Bachillerato\" (eleventh and twelfth grade) or choose a \"Ciclo de Formación Profesional\" (an improved type of vocational school).\n\nJunior high schools (three years from 7th to 9th grade) in Taiwan were originally called \"primary middle school\". However, in August 1968, they were renamed \"nationals' middle school\" often translated \"junior high\") when they became free of charge and compulsory. Private middle school nowadays are still called \"primary middle school\". Taiwanese students older than twelve normally attend junior high school. Accompanied with the switch from junior high to middle school was the cancellation of entrance examination needed to enter middle school.\n\nIn Tunisia and Morocco, a middle school includes grades 7 through 9, consisting of students from ages 12 to 15.\n\nIn England and Wales, local education authorities introduced middle schools in the 1960s and 1970s. The notion of Middle Schools was mooted by the Plowden Report of 1967 which proposed a change to a three-tier model including First schools for children aged between 4 and 7, Middle Schools for 7–11 year-olds, and then upper or high schools for 11–16 year-olds. Some authorities introduced Middle Schools for ideological reasons, in line with the report, while others did so for more pragmatic reasons relating to the raising of the school leaving age in compulsory education to 16, or to introduce a comprehensive system.\n\nDifferent authorities introduced different age-range schools, although in the main, three models were used:\n\nIn many areas \"primary school\" rather than first school was used to denote the first tier.\n\nIn addition, some schools were provided as combined schools catering for pupils in the 5–12 age range as a combined first and middle school.\n\nAround 2000 middle and combined schools were in place in the early 1980s. However, that number began to fall in the later 1980s with the introduction of the National Curriculum. The new curriculum's splits in Key Stages at age 11 encouraged the majority of local education authorities to return to a two-tier system of Primary (sometimes split into Infant schools and Junior schools) and Secondary schools. There are now fewer than 150 middle schools still operational in the United Kingdom, meaning that approximately 90% of middle schools have closed or reverted to primary school status since 1980. The system of 8-12 middle schools has fallen into complete disuse.\n\nUnder current legislation, all middle schools must be deemed either primary or secondary. Thus, schools which have more primary year groups than KS3 or KS4 are termed deemed primaries or middles-deemed-primaries, while those with more secondary-aged pupils, or with pupils in Y11 are termed deemed secondaries or middles-deemed-secondaries. For statistical purposes, such schools are often included under primary and secondary categories \"as deemed\". Notably, most schools also follow teaching patterns in line with their deemed status, with most deemed-primary schools offering a primary-style curriculum taught by one class teacher, and most deemed-secondary schools adopting a more specialist-centred approach. Legally all-through schools are also considered middle schools (deemed secondary), although they are rarely referred to as such.\n\nSome middle schools still exist in various areas of England. They are supported by the National Middle Schools' Forum. See List of middle schools in England.\n\nIn Scotland, a similar system to the English one was trialled in Grangemouth middle schools, Falkirk between 1975 and 1987. The label of junior high school is used for some through schools in Orkney and Shetland which cater for pupils from 5 up to the age of 14, at which point they transfer to a nearby secondary school.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council area in County Armagh, the Dickson Plan operates, whereby pupils attend a primary school from ages 4–10, a junior high school from 11–14, and a senior high school or grammar school from 14–19. This is not dissimilar to the middle school system.\n\nMiddle schools in the United States usually cover grades 5-6, 5–8, 6–8, or 7–8. Historically, local public control (and private alternatives) have allowed for some variation in the organization of schools. Elementary school includes kindergarten through to sixth grade, or kindergarten through to fifth grade, i.e., up to age 12, but some elementary schools have four or eight grades, i.e., up to ages 10 or 14 (also known as the intermediate grades). Basic subjects are taught and pupils often remain in one or two classrooms throughout the school day, except for physical education, library, music, and art classes. In 2001, there were about 3.6 million children in each grade in the United States. “Middle schools” and “junior high schools” are schools that span grades 5 or 6 to 8 and 7 to 8, respectively, but junior high schools spanning grades 7 to 9 were common until the 1980s.\n\nThe range defined by either is often based on demographic factors, such as an increase or decrease in the relative numbers of younger or older students, with the aim of maintaining stable school populations. At this time, pupils are given more independence, moving to different classrooms for different subjects, which includes math, social studies, science, and language arts. Also, pupils are able to choose some of their class subjects (electives). Usually, starting in ninth or tenth grade, grades become part of a pupil’s official transcript. In the U.S., children within this grade-range are sometimes referred to as “junior highers”.\n\nThe “junior high school” concept was introduced in 1909, in Columbus, Ohio. Junior high schools were created for \"bridging the gap between the elementary and the high school\", an emphasis credited to Charles W. Eliot. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, most American elementary schools had grades 1 through 8, and this organization still exists, where some concepts of middle school organization have been adapted to the intermediate grades. As time passed, the junior high school concept increased quickly as new school districts proliferated, or systems modernized buildings and curricula. This expansion continued through the 1960s. Jon Wiles, author of \"Developing Successful K–8 Schools: A Principal's Guide\", said that \"[a] major problem\" for the original model was \"the inclusion of the ninth grade\", because of the lack of instructional flexibility, due to the requirement of having to earn high school credits in the ninth grade—and that \"the fully adolescent ninth grader in junior high school did not seem to belong with the students experiencing the onset of puberty\". \n\nThe new \"middle school\" model began to appear in the mid-1960s. Wiles said, \"At first, it was difficult to determine the difference between a junior high school and a middle school, but as the middle school became established, the differences became more pronounced [...].\"\n\nThe faculty is organised into academic departments that operate more or less independently of one another.\n\nThe middle school format has now replaced the junior high format by a ratio of about ten to one in the United States, but at least two school districts had incorporated both systems in 2010.\n\nIn Uruguay, the public middle school consists of two stages, one mandatory called \"Basic Cycle\" or \"First Cycle\". This consists of three years, ages 12–13, 13–14 and 14–15, and one optional called \"Second Cycle\", ages 15–16, 16–17 and 17–18. The Second Cycle is divided into 4 options in the 5th grade: \"Human Sciences\", \"Biology\", \"Scientific\" and \"Arts\", and 7 options in the 6th and last grade: \"Law\" or \"Economy\" (if Human Sciences course taken in 5th), \"Medicine\" or \"Agronomy\" (if Biological course taken in 5th), \"Architecture\" or \"Engineering\" (if Scientific course taken in 5th) and \"Arts\" (if Arts course taken in 5th).\n\nBoth these stages are commonly known as \"Liceo\" (Spanish for \"high school\"). Middle school starts at grade 7 and ends at grade 9.\n\nIn Venezuela, public middle schools have a different Spanish name than private schools. The school system includes a preparatory year before first grade, so nominal grade levels are offset when compared to other countries (except those countries who have mandatory pre-school). Middle schools (\"educación media general\", ages 12–15) are from 7th grade (equivalent to 8th grade US) to 11th grade, which is equivalent to 12th grade.\n\nIn some institutions called \"Technical Schools\" there is an extra grade, for those who want to graduate as \"Middle technician\" in a certain area. This education would allow them to be hired at a higher level, or get introduced more easily into a college career.\n\nThere is a \"college test\" from main universities of the country.

Molluscs play a variety of roles in culture, including but not limited to art and literature, with both practical interactions—whether useful or harmful—and symbolic uses.\n\nPractical interactions with molluscs range from their use as food, where species as diverse as snails and squid are eaten in many countries, to the employment of molluscs as shell money and to make dyestuffs and musical instruments, for personal adornment with seashells, pearls, or mother-of-pearl, as items to be collected, as fictionalised sea monsters, and as raw materials for craft items such as Sailor's Valentines. Some bivalves are used as bioindicators to monitor the health of marine and freshwater environments.\n\nHarmful interactions with molluscs include the stings of cone snails and the venomous bites of certain octopuses; blue-ringed octopuses bite only when provoked, but their venom kills a quarter of the people bitten. Some snails are vectors of diseases such as schistosomiasis, a major tropical disease that infects some 200 million people; others are serious crop pests, and species such as the giant East African snail \"Lissachatina fulica\" have damaged ecosystems in areas where they have been introduced.\n\nMollusc shells have been widely used in art, whether carved directly, sometimes as cameos, or depicted in paintings.\nIn popular culture, the snail is known for its stereotypical slowness, while the octopus and giant squid have featured in literature since classical times as monsters of the deep. Many-headed and tentacled monsters appear as the Gorgon and the Medusa of Greek mythology, and the kraken of Nordic legend. The taxonomist Carl Linnaeus named the Venus shell as \"Venus dione\", for the goddess of love and her mother, and named its parts using overtly sexual descriptors.\n\nCulture consists of the social behaviour and norms found in human societies and transmitted through social learning. Cultural universals in all human societies include expressive forms like art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies like tool usage, cooking, shelter, and clothing. The concept of material culture covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of social organization, mythology, philosophy, literature, and science. This article describes the roles played by molluscs in human culture, so defined.\n\nSeashells are admired and collected by conchologists and others for scientific purposes and for their decorative qualities.\n\nSeashells have been used for personal adornment, such as the strings of cowries in the traditional dress of the Kikuyu people of Kenya, and the formal dress of the Pearly Kings and Queens of London.\n\nMost molluscs with shells can produce pearls, but only the pearls of bivalves and some gastropods, whose shells are lined with nacre, are valuable. The best natural pearls are produced by marine pearl oysters, \"Pinctada margaritifera\" and \"Pinctada mertensi\", which live in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific Ocean. Natural pearls form when a small foreign object gets stuck between the mantle and shell.\n\nPearls for use as jewellery are cultured by inserting either \"seeds\" or beads into oysters. The \"seed\" method uses grains of ground shell from freshwater mussels, and overharvesting for this purpose has endangered several freshwater mussel species in the southeastern United States. The pearl industry is so important in some areas, significant sums of money are spent on monitoring the health of farmed molluscs.\n\nSeashells including the sacred chank or shankha \"Turbinella pyrum\"; \"Triton's trumpet\" \"Charonia tritonis\"; and the Queen Conch \"Strombus gigas\" have been used as musical instruments around the world.\n\nSeashells have been made into craft items such as Sailor's Valentines in the 19th century. Souvenir items, now considered as serious art, are made by Aboriginal women from La Perouse in Sydney.\n\nMany species of mollusc, including gastropods such as whelks, bivalves such as scallops, cockles, mussels, and clams, and cephalopods such as octopuses and squids are collected or hunted for food. \n\nOysters, abalone, and several species of mussels are widely farmed; oyster farming began in Roman times. \n\nMany recipes from around the world are based on molluscs from all three major orders. Among cephalopod recipes, both octopus and squid are used in dishes such as the popular fried calamari, and in sushi and sashimi. Among bivalve recipes, clams are made into soups called chowders, or served as a sauce with pasta in dishes such as \"spaghetti alle vongole\", while mussels are widely eaten as \"moules marinieres\", nowadays often with \"frites\" (chips). Gastropod recipes include \"escargot\", terrestrial snails, in French cuisine, and whelks in cuisines around the world.\n\nTyrian or imperial purple, made from the ink glands of murex shells, \"... fetched its weight in silver\" in the fourth century BC, according to Theopompus. The discovery of large numbers of \"Murex\" shells on Crete suggests the Minoans may have pioneered the extraction of \"imperial purple\" during the Middle Minoan period in the 20th–18th centuries BC, centuries before the Tyrians.\n\nSea silk is a fine, rare, and valuable fabric produced from the long silky threads (byssus) secreted by several bivalve molluscs, particularly \"Pinna nobilis\", to attach themselves to the sea bed. Procopius, writing on the Persian wars \"circa\" 550 CE, \"stated that the five hereditary satraps (governors) of Armenia who received their insignia from the Roman Emperor were given chlamys (or cloaks) made from \"lana pinna\". Apparently, only the ruling classes were allowed to wear these chlamys.\"\n\nPeoples of the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, North America, Africa and the Caribbean have used shells as money, including \"Monetaria moneta\", the money cowrie in preindustrial societies. However, these were not necessarily used for commercial transactions, but mainly as social status displays at important occasions, such as weddings. When used for commercial transactions, they functioned as commodity money, as a tradable commodity whose value differed from place to place, often as a result of difficulties in transport, and which was vulnerable to incurable inflation if more efficient transport or \"goldrush\" behaviour appeared. Among the Eastern Woodlands tribes of North America, shell beads known as wampum were kept on strings and used as money.\n\nBivalve molluscs are used as bioindicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status and structure, physiology, behaviour and their levels of contamination with chemicals together provide a detailed indication of the status of the ecosystem. Because they are sessile, they serve as readily-monitored representatives of their environment.\n\nA few species of molluscs, including octopuses and cone snails, can sting or bite. Some present a serious risk to people handling them. However, deaths from jellyfish stings are ten times as common as those from mollusc bites.\n\nAll octopuses are venomous, but only a few species pose a significant threat to humans. Blue-ringed octopuses (\"Hapalochlaena\") from Australia and New Guinea have a powerful venom and warning coloration. They bite humans only if severely provoked, but their venom kills a quarter of the people bitten. Another tropical species, \"Octopus apollyon\", causes severe inflammation that can last for over a month even if treated correctly. The bite of \"O. rubescens\" can cause necrosis that lasts longer than one month if untreated, and headaches and weakness persisting for up to a week even if treated.\n\nAll marine cone snails are venomous and can sting when handled. Their venom is a complex mixture of toxins, some fast-acting and others slower but deadlier. Many painful stings have been reported, and a few fatalities. Only a few larger species of cone snails are likely to be seriously dangerous to humans. The effects of individual cone-shell toxins on victims' nervous systems are so precise as to be useful tools for research in neurology, and the small size of their molecules makes it easy to synthesize them.\n\nThe traditional belief that giant clams can trap the leg of a person between its valves, thus causing drowning, is a myth.\n\nMolluscs are vectors of parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis, a major tropical disease second only to malaria. It is caused by flukes, \"Schistosoma\" spp., and infects some 200 million people in 74 countries. The flukes have a complex life cycle with freshwater snails as intermediate hosts; people swimming or washing in the water are at risk of infection.\n\nSome snails and slugs are serious crop pests, and in new environments can unbalance local ecosystems. One such pest, the giant African snail \"Lissachatina fulica\", has been introduced to many parts of Asia and islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, reaching the West Indies in the 1990s. The predatory snail \"Euglandina rosea\" was disastrously introduced in an attempt to control it, as the predator ignored \"A. fulica\" but extirpated several native snail species instead.\n\nThe snail features in an animal epithet for its stereotypical slowness, while its shell-less relative the slug similarly denotes a person who is lazy and loathsome. \n\nCephalopod molluscs including the octopus and giant squid have featured as monsters of the deep since classical times. Giant squid are described by Aristotle (4th century BC) in his \"History of Animals\" and Pliny the Elder (1st century AD) in his \"Natural History\". The Gorgon of Greek mythology may have been inspired by the octopus or squid, the octopus itself representing the severed head of Medusa, the beak as the protruding tongue and fangs, and its tentacles as the snakes. The six-headed sea monster of the \"Odyssey\", Scylla, may have had a similar origin. The Nordic legend of the kraken may also have derived from sightings of large cephalopods; the science fiction writer Jules Verne told a tale of a kraken-like monster in his 1870 novel \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\".\n\nThroughout the world, the nautilus is captured to carve the elegantly shaped shells, and for their nacreous inner shell layer, a pearl substitute. Mother-of-pearl or nacre, which lines some mollusc shells, is used to make organic jewellery. It has traditionally been inlaid into furniture and boxes, particularly in China. It has been used to decorate musical instruments, watches, pistols, fans and other products. Shells have been used in Southern Italy as a cheaper alternative to layered stone when carving cameos. In the fine art of the Italian Renaissance, Sandro Botticelli's c. 1486 \"The Birth of Venus\" depicts the goddess Venus emerging from the waves on a scallop shell. In the Dutch Golden Age, still life painters such as Adriaen Coorte often depicted ornate sea shells of varied kinds in their compositions.\n\nIn his 1758 \"Systema Naturae\", and then in his 1771 \"Fundamenta Testaceologiae\", the pioneering taxonomist Carl Linnaeus used a series of \"disquieting[ly]\" sexual terms to describe the Venus shell: \"vulva\", \"anus\", \"nates\" (buttocks), \"pubis\", \"mons veneris\", \"labia\", \"hymen\". Further, he named the species \"Venus dione\", for Venus, the goddess of love, and Dione, her mother. The evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould called Linnaeus's description \"one of the most remarkable paragraphs in the history of systematics\". Some later naturalists found the terms used by Linnaeus uncomfortable; an 1803 review commented that \"a few of these terms however strongly they may be warranted by the similitudes and analogies which they express, ... are not altogether reconcilable with the delicacy proper to be observed in ordinary discourse\", while the 1824 \"Supplement to the Encyclopædia Britannica\" criticised Linnaeus for \"indulg[ing] in obscene allusions.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "35778491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35778491", "title": "Omphisa fuscidentalis", "text": "Omphisa fuscidentalis\n\nOmphisa fuscidentalis, the bamboo worm (and one of the insects called bamboo borer), is a moth of the Crambidae family. Its habitat are the bamboo groves and forests in the cooler regions of northern Thailand, northern Laos, northern Myanmar, and adjacent parts of Yunnan Province, China. The mature caterpillars are viewed as a delicacy by the inhabitants of these regions.\n\nThe wingspan of the male is 4 cm with a 2-cm-long body. The female is slightly larger with a 4.5 cm wingspan and a 2.2-cm-long body. The wings of this moth are orange-brown in colour, with black, curved stripes. The caterpillar is white in colour with a body length of 3.5 to 4 cm. \n\nThe adult moth only lives for two months: July and August. Mating takes place at night in early August after which the female lays a cluster of about 80-130 eggs near the base of a bamboo shoot. The larvae hatch after 12 days, and are pale brown in colour and covered with long hair. Working together, the larvae bore an entrance hole at an internode of the bamboo in one day. After entering the shoot, they then, also in one day, bore an exit hole for the mature moths from which to eventually emerge. The larvae turn white within three days.\n\nBoring their way upwards from one bamboo internode to another, the larvae feed on the fresh inner pulp of the bamboo while avoiding common predators such as birds. After 45 to 60 days, the larvae mature and migrate down to the internode containing the exit hole where they enter a period of diapause for eight months, hanging upside down from the roof of the internode. This long period of diapause is exceptional for a tropical insect, and probably caused by the monsoonal character of the region which has a cool, dry period from November to February, a hot season from March to June, followed by a wet period from June through October, affecting the availability of food for the larvae. The pupal phase takes 46 to 60 days and falls in June and July.\n\nEleven different species of bamboo are infested. The infestation does not harm the plants, but instead makes the bamboo stronger than uninfested bamboo. However, the bamboo worm's activity may cause irregular growth patterns in the bamboo shoots which they occupy. In northern Thailand, \"O. fuscidentalis\" infestations have been found in \"Dendrocalamus membranaceus\", \"D. hamiltonii\", \"D. strictus\", \"Bambusa nutans\", \"B. blumeana\", \"Gigantochloa albociliata\", and \"G. nigrociliata\".\n\nCollection of the larvae for consumption by people falls mainly in the period of diapause when the larvae congregate in one single internodal cavity. This involves carefully piercing through sections of the bamboo shoots with a cleaver where water is trapped. Cutting down the entire shoot will endanger the worms natural habitat. Together with other types of insects, the consumption of bamboo worms is gaining popularity in Asian regions. About 26% of their body weight is protein, and 51% fat. The name in Thai cuisine for this delicacy is \"bamboo worm\" (\"non mai phai\", ), but due to its appearance, it is commonly called \"rot duan\" (Thai: รถด่วน), meaning \"express train\". They are also considered to be an environmentally friendly diet as they do not require a large amount of resources when they are raised. Now, because of the greater demand for bamboo worms as food, they are being commercially bred and cultivated by insect farmers to ensure that their population in the wild is not affected. They are usually eaten deep-fried, sometimes flavoured with herbs, spices or condiments.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "66614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66614", "title": "Ornament (music)", "text": "Ornament (music)\n\nIn music, ornaments or embellishments are musical flourishes—typically, added notes—that are not essential to carry the overall line of the melody (or harmony), but serve instead to decorate or \"ornament\" that line (or harmony), provide added interest and variety, and give the performer the opportunity to add expressiveness to a song or piece. Many ornaments are performed as \"fast notes\" around a central, main note. There are many types of ornaments, ranging from the addition of a single, short grace note before a main note to the performance of a virtuostic and flamboyant trill. The amount of ornamentation in a piece of music can vary from quite extensive (it was often extensive in the Baroque period, from 1600 to 1750) to relatively little or even none. The word \"agrément\" is used specifically to indicate the French Baroque style of ornamentation.\n\nIn the Baroque period, it was common for performers to improvise ornamentation on a given melodic line. A singer performing a da capo aria, for instance, would sing the melody relatively unornamented the first time, but decorate it with additional flourishes and trills the second time. Similarly, a harpsichord player performing a simple melodic line was expected to be able to improvise harmonically and stylistically appropriate trills, mordents (upper or lower) and appoggiaturas.\n\nOrnamentation may also be indicated by the composer. A number of standard ornaments (described below) are indicated with standard symbols in music notation, while other ornamentations may be appended to the score in small notes, or simply written out normally as fully sized notes. Frequently, a composer will have his or her own vocabulary of ornaments, which will be explained in a preface, much like a code. A grace note is a note written in smaller type, with or without a slash through it, to indicate that its note value does not count as part of the total time value of the bar. Alternatively, the term may refer more generally to any of the small notes used to mark some other ornament (see below), or in association with some other ornament's indication (see below), regardless of the timing used in the execution.\n\nIn Spain, melodies ornamented upon repetition (\"divisions\") were called \"diferencias\", and can be traced back to 1538, when Luis de Narváez published the first collection of such music for the vihuela.\n\nA trill, also known as a \"shake\", is a rapid alternation between an indicated note and the one above. In simple music, the trills may be diatonic, using just the notes of the scale. \n\nSometimes it is expected that the trill will end with a turn (by sounding the note below rather than the note above the principal note, immediately before the last sounding of the principal note), or some other variation. Such variations are often marked with a few grace notes following the note that bears the trill indication. The trill is indicated by either a or a , with the ~ representing the length of the trill, above the staff. In Baroque music, the trill is sometimes indicated with a + (plus) sign above or below the note.\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\n</score>\nAt a moderate tempo, the above might be executed as follows:\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n</score>\n\nThere is also a single tone trill variously called \"trillo\" or \"tremolo\" in late Renaissance and early Baroque. Trilling on a single note is particularly idiomatic for the bowed strings.\n\nThe \"mordent\" is thought of as a rapid alternation between an indicated note, the note above (called the \"upper mordent\", \"inverted mordent\", or \"pralltriller\") or below (called the \"lower mordent\" or \"mordent\"), and the indicated note again.\n\nThe upper mordent is indicated by a short thick tilde (which may also indicate a trill); the lower mordent is the same with a short vertical line through it:\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\n</score> \n\nAs with the trill, the exact speed with which the mordent is performed will vary according to the tempo of the piece, but, at a moderate tempo, the above might be executed as follows:\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\n</score>\nConfusion over the meaning of the unadorned word \"mordent\" has led to the modern terms \"upper\" and \"lower\" mordent being used, rather than \"mordent\" and \"inverted mordent\". Practice, notation, and nomenclature vary widely for all of these ornaments; that is to say, whether, by including the symbol for a mordent in a musical score, a composer intended the direction of the additional note (or notes) to be played above or below the principal note written on the sheet music varies according to when the piece was written, and in which country. This article as a whole addresses an approximate nineteenth-century standard.\n\nIn the Baroque period, a Mordant (the German or Scottish equivalent of \"mordent\") was what later came to be called an \"inverted mordent\" and what is now often called a \"lower mordent\". In the 19th century, however, the name \"mordent\" was generally applied to what is now called the \"upper\" mordent. Although mordents are now thought of as just a single alternation between notes, in the Baroque period a \"Mordant\" may sometimes have been executed with more than one alternation between the indicated note and the note below, making it a sort of inverted trill. Mordents of all sorts might typically, in some periods, begin with an extra \"inessential note\" (the lesser, added note), rather than with the \"principal note\" as shown in the examples here. The same applies to trills, which in Baroque and Classical times would standardly begin with the added, upper note. A \"lower\" inessential note may or may not be chromatically raised (that is, with a natural, a sharp, or even a double sharp) to make it just one semitone lower than the principal note.\n\nA turn is a short figure consisting of the note above the one indicated, the note itself, the note below the one indicated, and the note itself again. It is marked by a mirrored S-shape lying on its side above the staff.\n\nThe details of its execution depend partly on the exact placement of the turn mark. The following turns:\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n« \\clef treble\n\n»\n</score>\n\nmight be executed like this::\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\n</score>\n\nThe exact speed at which the notes of a turn are executed can vary, as can its rhythm. The question of how a turn is best executed is largely one of context, convention, and taste. The lower and upper added notes may or may not be chromatically raised (see mordent).\n\nAn inverted turn (the note below the one indicated, the note itself, the note above it, and the note itself again) is usually indicated by putting a short vertical line through the normal turn sign, though sometimes the sign itself is turned upside down.\n\nThe \"Appoggiatura\" (; ) is an added note that is important melodically (unlike the acciaccatura) and suspends the principal note by a portion of its time-value, often about half, but this may be considerably more or less depending on the context. The added note (the unessential note) is one degree higher or lower than the principal note, and, if lower, it may or may not be chromatically raised. Appoggiaturas are also usually on the strong or strongest beat of the resolution, are themselves emphasised, and are approached by a leap and left by a step in the opposite direction of the leap.\n\nThe appoggiatura is often written as a grace note prefixed to a principal note and printed in small character, without the oblique stroke:\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\n</score>\n\nThis may be executed as follows:\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\n</score>\n\nAcciaccatura (, ; ) comes from the Italian verb \"\", \"to crush\". In the eighteenth century, it was an ornament applied to any of the main notes of arpeggiated chords, either a tone or semitone below the chord tone, struck simultaneously with it and then immediately released. Hence the German translation \"Zusammenschlag\" (together-stroke).\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the acciaccatura (sometimes called \"short appoggiatura\") came to be a shorter variant of the \"long appoggiatura\", where the delay of the principal note is quick. It is written using a grace note (often a quaver, or eighth note), with an oblique stroke through the stem. The \"acciaccatura\" in the Classical period is usually performed before the beat and the emphasis is on the main note not the grace note. The \"appoggiatura\" long or short has the emphasis on the grace note.\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\n</score>\n\nThe exact interpretation of this will vary according to the tempo of the piece, but the following is possible:\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\n</score>\n\nWhether the note should be played before or on the beat is largely a question of taste and performance practice. Exceptionally, the acciaccatura may be notated in the bar preceding the note to which it is attached, showing that it is to be played before the beat. (This guide to practice is unfortunately not available, of course, if the principal note does not fall at the beginning of the bar.)\n\nThe implication also varies with the composer and the period. For example, Mozart's and Haydn's long appoggiaturas are – to the eye – indistinguishable from Mussorgsky's and Prokofiev's before-the-beat acciaccaturas.\n\nA glissando is a slide from one note to another, signified by a wavy line connecting the two notes. All of the intervening diatonic or chromatic (depending on instrument and context) are heard, albeit very briefly. In this way, the glissando differs from portamento.\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n</score>\n\nIn contemporary classical music (especially in avant garde pieces) a glissando tends to assume the whole value of the initial note.\n\nA slide (Schleifer in German) instructs the performer to begin one or two diatonic steps below the marked note and slide upward. The schleifer usually includes a prall trill or mordent trill at the end.\n\nWillard A. Palmer wrote, \"The schleifer is a 'sliding' ornament, usually used to fill in the gap between a note and the previous one.\"\n\nOrnaments in Baroque music take on a different meaning. Most ornaments occur on the beat, and use diatonic intervals more exclusively than ornaments in later periods do. While any table of ornaments must give a strict presentation, consideration has to be given to the tempo and note length, since at rapid tempos it would be difficult or impossible to play all of the notes that are usually required. One realisation of some common Baroque ornaments is set in the following table from the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach written by J.S. Bach:\n\nFrom Silvestro Ganassi's treatise in 1535 we have instructions and examples of how musicians of the Renaissance and early Baroque periods decorated their music with improvised ornaments. Michael Praetorius spoke warmly of musicians' \"sundry good and merry pranks with little runs/leaps\".\n\nUntil the last decade of the 16th century the emphasis is on \"divisions\", also known as \"diminutions\", \"passaggi\" (in Italian), \"gorgia\" (\"throat\", first used as a term for vocal ornamentation by Nicola Vicentino in 1555), or \"glosas\" (by Ortiz, in both Spanish and Italian) – a way to decorate a simple cadence or interval with extra shorter notes. These start as simple passing notes, progress to step-wise additions and in the most complicated cases are rapid passages of equal valued notes – virtuosic flourishes. There are rules for designing them, to make sure that the original structure of the music is left intact. Towards the end of this period the divisions detailed in the treatises contain more dotted and other uneven rhythms and leaps of more than one step at a time.\n\nStarting with Archilei (1589), the treatises bring in a new set of expressive devices called \"graces\" alongside the divisions. These have a lot more rhythmic interest and are filled with affect as composers took much more interest in text portrayal. It starts with the \"trillo\" and \"cascate\", and by the time we reach Francesco Rognoni (1620) we are also told about fashionable ornaments: \"portar la voce\", \"accento\", \"tremolo\", \"gruppo\", \"esclamatione\" and \"intonatio\".\n\nKey treatises detailing ornamentation:\n\n\nIn Carnatic music, the Sanskrit term \"gamaka\" (which means \"to move\") is used to denote ornamentation. One of the most unusual forms of ornamentation in world music is the Carnatic \"kampitam\" which is about oscillating a note in diverse ways by varying amplitude, speed or number of times the note is oscillated. This is a highly subtle, yet scientific ornamentation as the same note can be oscillated in different ways based on the raga or context within a raga. For instance, the fourth note (Ma) in Shankarabharanam or Begada allows at least three to five types of oscillation based on the phrasings within the raga.\n\nAnother important gamaka in Carnatic is the \"Sphuritam\" which is about rendering a note twice but forcefully from a grace note immediately below it the second time. For instance, the third note (Ga) would be rendered plain first time and with a force from the second (Ri) the next time. \n\nOther important Carnatic ornamentation include aahatam, pratyaahatam, tripuchham, andolam, daalu, daatu and jaru. The last is similar to Western Classical glissando.\n\nOrnamentation is also used in popular music such as rock and pop. Rock piano playing has incorporated many ornaments from early 1900s blues piano styles such as boogie-woogie. Improvised ornaments in rock solos or instrumental melody lines are often idiosyncratic to specific instruments. Electric guitar players can draw from an immense array of ornaments that are specific to their instrument. Hammer-ons and pull-offs are two of the most basic techniques, and may be used in executing classical ornaments, as well as for the execution of ornaments more particular to guitar (such as tapping, which can be used as ornamentation or as a playing style in and of itself).\n\nWhile rock and pop are typically learned by ear, with the arrangements fleshed out with improvisation, the style also includes notated music, particularly in arranged music for larger ensembles. This notated music uses some of the most-used \"Classical\" ornaments, such as trills and mordents.\n\nJazz music incorporates a number of ornaments, which can be divided into improvised ornaments. They are added by performers during their solo extemporizations, and as written ornaments. Improvised ornaments are often idiosyncratic to specific instruments. The Hammond organ playing in the jazz subgenre of organ trio soul jazz often features trills which outline the harmony of a chord, glisses up or down the keyboard, and turn-like decorations. Saxophone players may decorate a simple melody line with turns, grace notes, and short glissandi created with the mouth and the reed.\n\nWhile jazz is substantially based upon improvisation, the style also includes notated music, particularly in music for larger ensembles such as big bands. Small ensembles may also use notated music for part of their performances, in arrangements of a tune's main theme. Notated jazz music incorporates most of the standard \"classical\" ornaments, such as trills, grace notes, and mordents. Written jazz notation may also include other ornaments, such as \"dead\" or ghost notes (a percussive sound, notated by an \"X\"), glissandi (step-wise glides between a start and destination note, written with a long line), \"doit\" notes and \"fall\" notes (annotated by curved lines above the note, indicating by direction of curve that the note should either rapidly rise or fall on the scale), or an instruction to \"fill\" part of a bar with an embellishment (notated with diagonal slashes in the bar).\n\nOrnamentation is a major distinguishing characteristic of Irish, Scottish, and Cape Breton music.

They comprise Professional Dart Players Association (PDPA) Players Championships, UK Open qualifiers and European Tour events.\n\nFrom 2011, the PDC Pro Tour operates a Tour Card system. 128 players are granted Tour Cards, which enables them to participate in all Players Championships and UK Open Qualifiers.\n\nThe 2011 Tour Cards were awarded to:\n\nTour Cards were also offered to the four semi-finalists from the 2011 BDO World Championship, although none of the players took up the offer.\n\nFrom 2012 onwards, the PDC awards Tour Cards were awarded to:\n\nFrom 2015 onwards, the PDC withdrew the Tour Cards awarded to BDO semi-finalist and the new distribution of Tour Cards is as follows:\n\nPlayers Championships, originally known as PDPA Players Championships, are organised by the Professional Dart Players Association (PDPA) and have increased in number in recent years. They are known as \"floor tournaments\", because they usually feature 16 darts boards in close proximity on an arena floor where the tournament is played in the space of a day. Televised events differ by having just one main board on a stage with the audience and cameras situated around it.\n\nEligibility for these events are usually restricted to PDPA members only, however tournaments held outside of the United Kingdom often allow entry to non-PDPA members who are residents of the country staging the tournament. Some overseas players from the BDO take the opportunity of playing in PDC Players Championships in their home countries.\n\nThe prize money won in Players Championships count towards the PDC Order of Merit, which contributes to each player's world ranking.\n\nDuring 2007, the PDC and PDPA added further importance to Players Championships by changing qualification criteria for major televised events. A separate Players Championship Order of Merit was introduced which calculates players earnings for these tournaments only each calendar year. The players who won the most money (without qualifying automatically via the PDC Order of Merit) were awarded qualifying places at major tournaments, such as the World Matchplay, World Grand Prix and World Championship.\n\nPreviously, a sudden-death knockout qualifying tournament decided the players which meant players could miss out on tournaments because of unlucky matches or unlucky draws. The World Championship, however, still maintains an additional qualifying tournament - from which Kirk Shepherd emerged and went on to reach the world final itself in 2008. This was dropped for the 2010 running of the event, however it was reinstated for 2011.\n\nPDPA members must enter events through the PDC's online entry system, while non-PDPA members must enter through the local organiser for the relevant event. The entry fee for all Players Championships is £100 for Tour Card holders.\n\nIn addition, seedings for Players Championship events are determined by a one-year rolling Players Championship Order of Merit, consisting of prize money won in Players Championships over the 12 months before that event. The top 32 players in the Order of Merit that have entered the tournament are seeded.\n\nAll UK Players Championship events have a 128-player draw.\n\nAll non-UK Players Championship events consist of no more than 256 players, with all Tour Card holders that have entered the event starting at the last 128 stage.\n\nIf fewer than 128 players enter a Players Championship event, byes are awarded to players in order of their seeding. For example, if there is one bye, the number 1 seed will receive a bye into the last 64.\n\nThe prize money for PDC Pro Tour events has increased steadily over the years. Prize money is awarded to all players who reach at least the last 64 of a Pro Tour event. In the past, Players Championships held outside of Europe awarded less prize money than those held in the United Kingdom or Europe.\n\nIn 2011, all Players Championship events and UK Open qualifiers awarded £34,600 each, but from 2013 on Players Championship events awarded £50,000.\n\nUp to 2013 on the Pro Tour, there was also a rolling jackpot for nine-dart finishes. £500 (Players Championship events) / £400 (UK Open qualifiers) per event is reserved for any player who hits a nine-dart finish, with the money rolling over to the next event if the feat is not achieved. If more than one player hits a nine-darter in an event, the jackpot is shared.\n\nPrize funds for Pro Tour events over the years:\nThe UK Open is a major tournament which took place at Bolton's Reebok Stadium each year in June from 2003-2013. From 2014 onwards it has taken place in March at Minehead. Prior to the televised event, there are eight UK Open Qualifiers (originally named Regional Finals), where the prize money won is collated into a UK Open Order of Merit table which determines 96 qualifiers for the UK Open finals in Bolton. From 2003-2015 there were ties and a preliminary round would be used to reduce the field to 96. In 2016 ties were scrapped and count back was used to separate players who were level.\n\nThe tournaments are organised in a similar fashion to the Players Championships in that 32 boards are in operation for a non-televised \"floor tournament\", completed inside one day. During the 2007-08 UK Open, sponsors Blue Square streamed live coverage of these Regional Finals on the internet.\n\nFrom 2011 until 2013, the UK Open Qualifiers were held on four double-header weekends instead of being held on eight Sundays. From 2014 onwards there were only 6 UK Open Qualifiers.\n\nUntil the 2010 UK Open, a player must have competed in at least three Qualifiers before being able to qualify for the televised stages. From 2011 onwards, this was reduced to two Qualifiers.\n\nUntil 2007-08, the tournaments were open to all darts players, which meant that players from both darts organisations, the PDC and the BDO were able to compete. They are now restricted to PDPA members only.\n\nIn 2012, the PDC introduced a series of five tournaments held across Europe known as the European Tour. The number of events has steadily risen with eight held in 2013 and 2014, nine in 2015, and there will be ten held in 2016. These events see the top players on the PDC Order of Merit compete against players from a UK qualifier, European qualifier and home nations qualifier (the country where the event is held). Currently the prize fund for each tournament is £135,000, with £25,000 going to the winner. These events differ to others held on the Pro Tour as they are played on one board in front of an audience. They are not televised, but selected events have been available on the PDC's YouTube channel in the past.\n\n"}
{"id": "550203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=550203", "title": "Red mercury", "text": "Red mercury\n\nRed mercury is a substance of uncertain composition purportedly used in the creation of nuclear bombs, as well as a variety of unrelated weapons systems. It is considered a hoax and the existence of such a substance has not been documented. Samples of \"red mercury\" obtained from arrested would-be terrorists invariably consisted of nothing more than various red dyes or powders. It has been suggested these may have been sold as part of a campaign intended to flush out potential nuclear smugglers.\n\nIt is purported to be mercuric iodide, a poisonous, odorless, tasteless, water-insoluble scarlet-red powder that becomes yellow when heated above 126 °C, due to a thermochromatic change in crystalline structure.\n\nThe \"red mercury\" hoax was first reported in 1979, and was commonly discussed in the media in the 1990s. Prices as high as $1,800,000 per kilogram were reported.\n\nReferences to red solid mercury first appeared in major Soviet and western media sources in the late 1980s. The articles were never specific as to what exactly red mercury was, but nevertheless claimed it was of great importance in nuclear bombs, or that it was used in the building of boosted fission weapons. Almost as soon as the stories appeared, people started attempting to buy it. At that point the exact nature of the substance started to change, and eventually turned into anything the buyer happened to be interested in. As \"New Scientist\" reported in 1992, a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory report outlined that:\n\n<poem>When red mercury first appeared on the international black market 15 years ago, the supposedly top secret nuclear material was 'red' because it came from Russia. When it resurfaced last year in the formerly communist states of Eastern Europe it had unaccountably acquired a red colour. But then, as a report from the US Department of Energy reveals, mysterious transformations are red mercury's stock in trade.\n\nThe report, compiled by researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, shows that in the hands of hoaxers and conmen, red mercury can do almost anything the aspiring Third World demagogue wants it to. You want a short cut to making an atom bomb? You want the key to Soviet ballistic missile guidance systems? Or perhaps you want the Russian alternative to the anti-radar paint on the stealth bomber? What you need is red mercury.</poem>\n\nA key event in the history of the red mercury story was an article in the daily Russian newspaper \"Pravda\" in 1993. Claiming to be based on leaked top secret memos, they noted that red mercury was:\n\n[A] super-conductive material used for producing high-precision conventional and nuclear bomb explosives, 'Stealth' surfaces and self-guided warheads. Primary end-users are major aerospace and nuclear-industry companies in the United States and France along with nations aspiring to join the nuclear club, such as South Africa, Israel, Iran, Iraq, and Libya.\n\nTwo TV documentaries about red mercury were made by British Channel 4 television, airing in 1993 and 1994, \"Trail of Red Mercury\" and \"Pocket Neutron\", which claimed to have \"startling evidence that Russian scientists have designed a miniature neutron bomb using a mysterious compound called red mercury\".\n\nSamuel T. Cohen, an American physicist who worked on building the atomic bomb, said in his autobiography that red mercury is manufactured by \"mixing special nuclear materials in very small amounts into the ordinary compound and then inserting the mixture into a nuclear reactor or bombarding it with a particle-accelerator beam.\" When detonated, this mixture allegedly becomes \"extremely hot, which allows pressures and temperatures to be built up that are capable of igniting the heavy hydrogen and producing a pure-fusion mini neutron bomb.\"\n\nRed mercury was offered for sale throughout Europe and the Middle East by Russian businessmen, who found many buyers who would pay almost anything for the substance even though they had no idea what it was. A study for the \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\" in 1997 has perhaps the best summary of the topic:\n\nThe asking price for red mercury ranged from $100,000 to $300,000 per kilogram. Sometimes the material would be irradiated or shipped in containers with radioactive symbols, perhaps to convince potential buyers of its strategic value. But samples seized by police contained only mercury(II) oxide, mercury(II) iodide, or mercury mixed with red dye—hardly materials of interest to weapons-makers.\n\nFollowing the arrest of several men in Britain in September 2004, on suspicion that they were trying to buy a kilogram of red mercury for £300,000, the International Atomic Energy Agency made a statement dismissing claims that the substance is real. \"Red mercury doesn't exist,\" said the spokesman. \"The whole thing is a bunch of malarkey.\" When the case came to trial at the Old Bailey in April 2006, it became apparent that \"News of the World\"s \"fake sheikh\" Mazher Mahmood had worked with the police to catch the three men, Dominic Martins, Roque Fernandes and Abdurahman Kanyare. They were tried for \"trying to set up funding or property for terrorism\" and \"having an article (a highly dangerous mercury based substance) for terrorism\". According to the prosecutor, red mercury was believed to be a material which could cause a large explosion, possibly even a nuclear reaction, but whether or not red mercury actually existed was irrelevant to the prosecution. All three men were acquitted in July 2006.\n\nA variety of different items have been chemically analyzed as putative samples of \"red mercury\" since the substance first came to the attention of the media, but no single substance was found in these items. A sample of radioactive material was seized by German police in May 1994. This consisted of a complex mixture of elements, including about 10% by weight plutonium, with the remainder consisting of 61% mercury, 11% antimony, 6% oxygen, 2% iodine and 1.6% gallium. A formula reported for the powder component of the mixture was HgSbO (mercury(II) cyclopyrorthoantimonate), with some of the mercury present in its pure metallic form. The reason why somebody had assembled this complex mixture of chemicals is unknown; equally puzzling was the presence of fragments of glass and brush bristles, suggesting that someone had dropped a bottle of this substance and then swept it up into a new container.\n\nIn contrast, an analysis reported in 1998 of a different \"red mercury\" sample concluded that this sample was a non-radioactive mixture of elemental mercury, water and mercury(II) iodide, which is a red colored chemical. Similarly, another analysis of a sample recovered in Zagreb in November 2003 reported that this item contained only mercury. One formula that had been claimed previously for red mercury was HgSbO (mercury(II) pyroantimonate), but no antimony was detected in this 2003 sample.\n\nRed mercury was described by many commentators, and the exact nature of its supposed working mechanism varied widely among them. In general, however, none of these explanations appear to be scientifically or historically supportable.\n\nTraditional staged thermonuclear weapons consist of two parts, a fission \"primary\" and a fusion/fission \"secondary\". The energy released by the primary when it explodes is used to (indirectly) compress the secondary and start a fusion reaction within it. Conventional explosives are far too weak to provide the level of compression needed.\n\nThe primary is generally built as small as possible, due to the fact that the energy released by the secondary is much larger, and thus building a larger primary is generally inefficient. There is a lower limit on the size of the primary that can be built, known as the critical mass. For weapons grade plutonium, this is around 10 kg. This can be reduced through the use of neutron reflectors or clever arrangements of explosives to compress the core, but these methods generally add to the size and complexity of the resulting device.\n\nDue to the need for a fission primary, and the difficulty of purifying weapons-grade fissile materials, the majority of arms control efforts to limit nuclear proliferation rely on the detection and control of the fissile material and the equipment needed to obtain it.\n\nA theory popular in the mid-1990s was that red mercury facilitated the enrichment of uranium to weapons-grade purity. Conventionally, such enrichment is usually done with Zippe-type centrifuges, and takes several years. Red mercury was speculated to eliminate this costly and time-consuming step. Although this would not eliminate the possibility of detecting the material, it could escape detection during enrichment as the facilities hosting centrifuges normally used in this process are very large and require equipment that can be fairly easily tracked internationally. Eliminating such equipment would in theory greatly ease the construction of a clandestine nuclear weapon.\n\nA key part of the secondary in a fusion bomb is lithium-6-deuteride. When irradiated with high-energy neutrons, Li-6 creates tritium, which mixes with the deuterium in the same mixture and fuses at a relatively low temperature. Russian weapon designers have reported (1993) that red mercury was the Soviet codename for lithium-6, which has an affinity for mercury and tends to acquire a red colour due to mercuric impurities during its separation process.\n\nSamuel T. Cohen, the \"father of the neutron bomb\", claimed for a long time that red mercury is a powerful explosive-like chemical known as a ballotechnic. The energy released during its reaction is allegedly enough to directly compress the secondary without the need for a fission primary in a thermonuclear weapon. He claimed that he learned that the Soviet scientists perfected the use of red mercury and used it to produce a number of softball-sized pure fusion bombs weighing as little as , which he claimed were made in large numbers.\n\nHe went on to claim that the reason this is not more widely known is that elements within the US power structure are deliberately keeping it \"under wraps\" due to the frightening implications such a weapon would have on nuclear proliferation. Since a red mercury bomb would require no fissile material, it would seemingly be impossible to protect against its widespread proliferation given current arms control methodologies. Instead of trying to do so, they simply claim it does not exist, while acknowledging its existence privately. Cohen also claimed that when President Boris Yeltsin took power, he secretly authorized the sale of red mercury on the international market, and that fake versions of it were sometimes offered to gullible buyers.\n\nCohen's claims appear to be difficult to support scientifically. The amount of energy released by the fission primary is thousands of times greater than that released by conventional explosives, and it appears that the \"red mercury\" approach would be orders of magnitude smaller than required. Furthermore, ballotechnic materials are those that do \"not\" explode, so it is difficult to understand how their energy could be used to produce compression at all.\n\nAdditionally, it appears there is no independent confirmation of any sort of Cohen's claims to the reality of red mercury. The scientists in charge of the labs where the material would have been made have publicly dismissed the claims (see below), as have numerous US colleagues, including Edward Teller.\n\nAccording to Cohen, veteran nuclear weapon designer Dr. Frank Barnaby conducted secret interviews with Russian scientists who told him that red mercury was produced by dissolving mercury antimony oxide in mercury, heating and irradiating the resultant amalgam, and then removing the elemental mercury through evaporation. The irradiation was reportedly carried out by placing the substance inside a nuclear reactor.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the origins of the term \"red mercury\" was in the Russian newspaper \"Pravda\", which claimed that red mercury was \"a super-conductive material used for producing high-precision conventional and nuclear bomb explosives, 'stealth' surfaces and self-guided warheads.\" Any substance with these sorts of highly differing properties would be suspect to most, but the stealth story continued to have some traction long after most had dismissed the entire story.\n\nGiven that metallic hydrogen (MH) is theorized to exist, and was allegedly produced in a laboratory in 2016, as reported in the journal \"Science\", it is possible, though unlikely, that it may have been discovered earlier through unrelated experimentation, and so-called \"red mercury\" may in fact be MH. It has been said that one possible way to make it in bulk is to use a hydrogen-rich polymer under high pressure and/or pulsed laser irradiation, but the sample found so far is reportedly a shiny red metal.\nIf MH is indeed metastable, then it would theoretically make a very effective explosive in the right configuration, 38 times more powerful than RDX, and ideal for replacing the shaped charges used in a conventional warhead. Project Orion may well have used a variant of this, had it not been canceled due to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Intriguingly, MH is also theorized to be a superconductor well above room temperature, so it may have found applications in sensors and powerful computers even without the ability to make it in bulk. Some reports suggest that the sample obtained shows weak signs of a Meissner effect even at 250K.\n\nRed mercury is thought by some to be the invention of an intelligence agency or criminal gang for the purpose of deceiving terrorists and rogue states who were trying to acquire nuclear technology on the black market. One televised report indicated that the Soviet Union encouraged the KGB and GRU to arrange sting operations for the detection of those seeking to deal in nuclear materials. The Soviet intelligence services allegedly created a myth of the necessity of \"red mercury\" for the sorts of nuclear devices that terrorists and rogue governments might seek. Political entities that already had nuclear weapons did nothing to debunk the myth.\n\nIn 1999 \"Jane's Intelligence Review\" suggested that victims of red mercury scams may have included Osama bin Laden.\n\nOrganizations involved in landmine clearance and unexploded munitions disposal noted a belief amongst some communities in southern Africa that red mercury may be found in certain types of ordnance. Attempting to extract red mercury, purported to be highly valuable, was reported as a motivation for people dismantling items of unexploded ordnance, and suffering death or injury as a result. In some cases it was reported that unscrupulous traders may be deliberately promoting this misconception in an effort to build a market for recovered ordnance.\n\nAn explosion in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe that killed five people is attributed to a quest to reclaim red mercury from a live landmine.\n\nIn April 2009 it was reported from Saudi Arabia that rumors that Singer sewing machines contained \"red mercury\" had caused the prices of such machines to massively increase in the Kingdom, with some paying up to SR200,000 for a single machine which could previously have been bought for SR200. Believers in the rumor claimed that the presence of red mercury in the sewing machines' needles could be detected using a mobile telephone; if the line cut off when the telephone was placed near to the needle, this supposedly proved that the substance was present.\n\nIn Medina there was a busy trade in the sewing machines, with buyers seen using mobile phones to check the machines for red mercury content, while it was reported that others had resorted to theft, with two tailors' shops in Dhulum broken into and their sewing machines stolen. At other locales, there were rumors that a Kuwait-based multinational had been buying up the Singer machines, while in Al-Jouf, the residents were led to believe that a local museum was buying up any such machines that it could find, and numerous women appeared at the museum offering to sell their Singer machines.\n\nThere was little agreement among believers in the story as to the exact nature or even color of the red mercury, while the supposed uses for it ranged from it being an essential component of nuclear power, to having the ability to summon jinn, extract gold, or locate buried treasure and perform other forms of magic. The official spokesman for the Riyadh police said that the rumors had been started by gangs attempting to swindle people out of their money, and denied the existence of red mercury in sewing machines.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40930170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40930170", "title": "Sexecology", "text": "Sexecology\n\nSexecology (also ecosexuality) is a radical form of environmental activism based around nature fetishism, the idea of the earth as a lover. It invites people to treat the earth with love rather than see it as an infinite resource to exploit. It was founded by Elizabeth Stephens and Annie Sprinkle, who describe themselves as \"two ecosexual artists-in-love\", whose manifesto is to make environment activism \"more sexy, fun, and diverse\". Sexecology employs absurdist humor, performance art and sex-positivity, which Stephens claims \"may produce new forms of knowledge that hold potential to alter the future by privileging our desire for the Earth to function with as many diverse, intact and flourishing ecological systems as possible.\" \" The couple promote education, events such as the ecosex symposium, and activism, such as protecting the Appalachian Mountains from mountain top removal.\n\nSexecology conceives of the earth not as a mother, but as a lover. This conceptual shift invites people to engage their bodies and senses in acts of environmental preservation.\n\nUnlike ecofeminism, sexecology does not see an intrinsic link between women and nature; some of the limitations of ecofeminism which sex ecology indirectly addresses are \"the reliance on women's biological functions to establish a connection between women and nature, the uncritical over-privileging of women's experiences, the inappropriateness of designating ideal female characteristics, and the regressive political implications of associating women with nature\". \"The formulation of an Eco-Sexual identity is a practice of an erotic eco-logic, deconstructing heteronormative constructions of gender, sex, sexuality, and nature in order to continually queer and destabilize identities, actively form and retain spaces of lack that necessitate interdependency, and engage a permeable sensuous self in perpetual sensorial reciprocity with the sensing and sensible more-than-human environment. It is an identity identified by desire rather than a stable essence or being, and it is a desire for the more-than-human environment in which the human subject is sensorially implicit.\"\n\nProponents of this movement are called \"ecosexuals\"; they are unafraid to engage in and embrace their erotic experience with the earth, such as bathing naked, having sex with vegetables or having an orgasm in a waterfall. Stephens describes ecosexuals as people who \"... are related to cyborgs and are not afraid of engaging in intercourse with nature and/or with technology for that matter. We make love with the Earth through our senses.\"\n\nEcosexuals range from those who use sustainable sex products and like being nude in nature to those who \"roll around in the dirt having an orgasm covered in potting soil\" and those who \"masturbate under a waterfall\" \"[Sprinkle and Stephens] have officiated wedding ceremonies where they and fellow ecosexuals marry the earth, the moon, and other natural entities\" They have also stated that they believe there are over 100,000 people who identify as ecosexual worldwide\nStefanie Iris Weiss wrote a book about using sustainable sex products called \"Eco-sex: Go Green Between the Sheets and Make Your Love Life Sustainable\". She brings up the environmental impact and the carbon footprint we leave behind when using condoms, lube, and other sex products. The overall purpose of the book is to bring awareness of the environmental impact of current sex products while introducing more eco-friendly alternatives.\n\nSexecology seeks to direct attention towards “the ways in which sex and sexuality affect the larger nonhuman world.” Ecosexuality is an orientation directed toward the non-human material world. With this direction, ecosexuality makes a bold statement that “these human bodies are part of the nonhuman material world.” The blur between human and non-human entities is essential to Sprinkles and Stephens’ demonstration of sexecology.\n\nSexecology was influenced by contemporary theories around posthumanism and the relationships between humans and nonhumans.\n\n\"Haraway’s work has guided my understanding of the material consequences and the theoretical underpinnings embedded in human/nonhuman relationships that matrix our world. This has helped me understand how human exceptionalism has been constructed and privileged throughout the history of religion and science as well as in other secular practices in western culture. Human exceptionalism, in collaboration with global capitalism, has created the isolated space necessary for the ongoing practices that have produced the dangerously degraded environmental conditions in which we now live. The belief systems and ideologies that allow some people to think that they have the Darwinian survival skill and the rights that accompany those skills to use or destroy other human and non humans is now causing the kind of environmental degradation that affects the whole system sooner or later.\"\n\n“The Love Art Lab projects aim to instill hope, create an antidote to fear, and act as a call for action.” It is a private demonstration into the work of the two founders of the movement, Sprinkles and Stephens, as the research how to become \"lovers with the earth. The performances can be privately booked by contacting the two and are meant to be demonstrational, informative, and \"radical.\"\n\nSprinkles and Stephens have performed a number of \"weddings to the earth\" across the world intended to break the barrier between human sexuality and nature. The performances include \"Wedding to the Dirt, Wedding to Lake Kallavesi, Wedding to the Coal, Wedding to the Rocks, Wedding to the Snow, Wedding to the Moon, Wedding to the Appalachian Mountains, Wedding to the Earth, and Wedding to the Sea\", to date. The intention, according to Sprinkles, is to \"…shift the metaphor from ‘Earth as Mother’ to ‘Earth as Lover´\" \n\nSprinkles and Stephens have performed a two women show 25 Ways to Make Love to the Earth (Theatre Piece) at the Kosmos Theatre in Vienna in 2010 to demonstrate how to \"make love with the earth\", including talking, singing, dancing, and stroking natural objects. The performances are educational as well as self-promoting of the movement.\n\nThe aesthetic strategies of sexecology are influenced by Joseph Beuys' concept of social sculpture, which sees art as having the potential to transform society.\n\n\"... the production of visible art may effect the production of invisible ideological and class relations. For Joseph Beuys, sculpture and artistic creativity hold the potential to reshape the educational and governmental institutions that produce ideological subjects, as well as social, political, and economic systems. Art, Beuys argues, is the necessary condition for the production of a revolutionary society because it can both unravel the old order and engage everyone in the production of a new social order.\"\n\nEcosexuals have held a number of educational workshops. They have engaged in on-site environmental activism, such as \"Occupy Bernal\" and protests against mountaintop removal, as shown in the film \"Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story.\"\n\n\"Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story\" (2013) is a autoethnographic documentary film by Elizabeth Stephens with Annie Sprinkle about the environmental issue of Mountaintop removal in West Virginia, United States. West Virginia native Stephens returns to her childhood home to create a film that incorporates autobiography, a brief history of the coal industry, an inventory of activist strategies, an eco-sexual mini-manifesto, and finally, an example of the performance art Stephens and Sprinkle often employ to express their ecosexuality. Stephens presents a community struggling to rectify their love of their natural mountainous environment with the fact that its destruction via MTR provides the local economy. The piece explores the negative consequences of mountaintop removal, both cosmetic and environmental, and culminates in an exploration of ecosexuality, followed by wedding ceremony in which Stephens and Sprinkle \"marry\" the mountain. “Ecosexuality inserts an ‘erotic’ humor that plays against the horrific subject matter. So far the feedback that I’ve received at film previews makes me realize that these are effective strategies for creating space to briefly cut the feeling of despair that MTR evokes.”\n\n\n"}

Singing telegrams are historically linked to normal telegrams, but tend to be humorous. Sometimes the artist is in costume or formal clothing. Singing telegrams are often given as a gift.\n\nWestern Union, the American telegraph company began offering singing telegram services in 1933. That July 28, a fan sent Hollywood singing star Rudy Vallee a birthday greeting by telegram. George P. Oslin (1899–1996), the Western Union public relations director, decided this would be a good opportunity to make telegrams, which had been associated with deaths and other tragic news, into something more popular. He asked a Western Union operator, Lucille Lipps, to sing the message over the telephone, and this became the first singing telegram. While Oslin created the singing telegram because he thought \"that messages should be fun,\" he recalled that he \"was angrily informed I was making a laughingstock of the company.\"\n\nAs relatively few telegram recipients had telephones, most telegrams, including singing telegrams, were first delivered in person. The popularization of the telephone in the 1960s reduced telegrams in general. By 1972, Western Union was receiving a small number of requests for singing telegrams and was seeking regulatory approval on a state-by-state basis to eliminate the offering. Western Union suspended its singing telegram service in 1974, but independent singing telegram companies, specializing in often costumed personal delivery of gift messages, have kept up the tradition.\n\nA DIY singing telegram is a specially written song all about the person in karaoke DVD form, so that any singer anywhere in the world can deliver the fully personalised singing telegram.\n\nA kissogram, also called kissagram (short for kissing telegram), is a message delivered along with a kiss, usually arranged as a fun surprise for a person for a special occasion. Message deliverers can be hired either by themselves, or as part of an agency. A kissogram is usually presented by a performer dressed in a costume or uniform such as a police officer, nurse, french maid or nun. This term was used in the TV program Doctor Who to describe the profession of Doctor Who's companion Amy Pond. \n\nA stripogram or strippergram is a form of message delivery in which a stripper will perform a striptease while singing or dancing. The word is a combination of telegram and striptease. This type of entertainment became popular in the 1970s in the US and spread to the UK and Europe during the 1980s. Typically a Strip-O-Gram is most often a form of gift given for a birthday, anniversary or bachelor party. A common practice is for the stripper-gram to be dressed in an outfit of one kind or another and to act out some form of charade connected with this, before commencing their act - for example a police officer 'arresting' somebody, a lawyer pretending to serve papers, a jilted bride and so on (sometimes this charade will be relevant to something the intended 'victim' has experienced, such as a divorce, or brush with the law). Usually a Strip-o-gram entertainer is accompanied by a chaperone, who plays her music, holds on to the money, tips and secures her safety. Unlike an escort who comes alone and does more of a one on one with the celebrant and is not chaperoned. Now-a-days, some agencies or performers do both to secure a bigger pay out.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a collaboration of independent singing telegrams companies in the U.S. was formed by Larry Balsamo, Hey!Wires Sing Telegrams in Chicago. Similar to Florists' Transworld Delivery, the Star System was a referral system for people to send a singing telegram to friends and family throughout the United States.\n\nIn the 1976 season 5, episode 1 of The Bob Newhart Show, Bob receives a singing telegram announcing a visit from his college roommate and his new wife. \n\nIn the 1985 movie \"Brazil\", Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) received an invitation to his mother's party via singing telegram. When told the message had been sent Reply Paid, he attempted to sing his reply.\n\nIn \"Clue\", 1985, a singing telegram (Jane Wiedlin) arrives and is shot on the doorstep. She is later revealed to be a secret blackmail informant. \n\nIn a classic episode of Sesame Street, Grover poses as a singing telegram artist. He goes up to Mr. Johnson singing a series of singing telegrams not directed for him until he eventually gives him the right telegram. The telegram is about Mr. Johnson's hat being found by someone in Buffalo, New York, but to Mr. Johnson's dismay, Grover forgets who sent the telegram.\n\nIn the 1987 MacGyver episode \"Soft Touch\", Penny Parker (Teri Hatcher) tries her hand at being a singing telegram deliveryperson. But due to her forgetfully visiting the wrong address, she happens to witness two thugs torturing a man.\n\nIn \"The Fisher King\", 1991, Parry (Robin Williams) sends a singing telegram (Michael Jeter) to Lydia, the love interest in her office.\n\nIn the 2010 \"Doctor Who\" episode \"The Eleventh Hour\", the Doctor's companion Amy Pond worked delivering kissograms, prior to traveling with the Doctor.\n\n\n"}

In the past, Surmic had been known as “Didinga-Murle” and “Surma”. The former name was too narrow by referring only to two closely related languages and the latter was a label also used to refer to a specific language (Unseth 1997b), so the label “Surmic” is now used. The relationships in the chart above are based on Fleming's work (1983).\n\nToday, the various peoples who speak Surmic languages make their living in a variety of ways, including nomadic herders, settled farmers, slash and burn farmers. They live in a variety of terrain, from the lowlands of South Sudan and the banks of the Omo River to mountains over 2,300 meters.\n\nMuch foundational fieldwork and analysis of Surmic languages was done by Harold C. Fleming and M. L. Bender. The most complete descriptions of Ethiopian Surmic languages are of Murle (Arensen 1982) and Tirma (Bryant 1999). All Surmic languages are presumed to be tonal, have implosive consonants, and have distinctive vowel length. Some have as many as nine vowel qualities, and more detailed study may confirm this in other Surmic languages, also. Me'en and Kwegu (also spelled Koegu) have sets of ejective consonants.\n\nThe languages share a system of marking the number of both the possessed and the possessor in possessive pronouns (Unseth 1991). Number of nominals is typically marked on a number of morphemes, with t/k marking singular and plural (Bryan 1959). Adjectives are formed by stative relative clauses.\n\nMajangir (also called Majang) and Southwest Surmic languages (Fleming 1983) share a number of traits, so they are therefore presumably reconstructable in Proto-Surmic: relative clauses (which include adjectives), demonstratives, adverbs, numerals, genitives, and possessive pronouns follow their heads, noun derivations and subject marking on verbs are marked by suffixes, VSO (verb–subject–object) order predominates in indicative main clauses. Some typologically exceptional points are discussed by Arensen, et al. (1997). However, Dimmendaal’s introduction proposes a different analysis (1998).\n\nAll Surmic languages have been documented as having case suffixes (Unseth 1989). None of them have a marked accusative, but at least Majang and Murle sometimes mark nominatives, part of a broader areal pattern (König 2006).\n\nThe original geographic home of the Surmic peoples is thought to be in Southwestern Ethiopia, somewhere near Maji, with the various groups dispersing from there: for example, the Majangir having moved north, the Murle having migrated clockwise around Lake Turkana (Arensen 1983:56-61, Tornay 1981), and the Mursi having moved into and out of the Omo River valley. Ethnolinguistic identities within the Surmic group have not been rigid, with ample evidence of people’s identities shifting from one ethnolinguistic group to another (Tornay 1981, Turton 1979, Unseth and Abbink 1998).\n\nAbbink has published a pioneering work comparing the vocabulary and systems of kinship among Surmic languages, particularly from the South West node of Surmic (Abbink 2006).\n\nThe starting point for linguistic and anthropological research into Surmic studies is the book edited by Dimmendaal (1998), especially the bibliography article (Abbink and Unseth 1998).\n\n"}

{"id": "25135727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25135727", "title": "Vera Borea", "text": "Vera Borea\n\nVera Borea is a French fashion house founded in 1931 in Paris, France by Countess Borea de Buzzaccarini Regoli.\n\nVera Borea was one of the very first houses to offer luxury sportswear for women. The house produced high-end garments for ski, tennis, golf, beach, boating, motoring, biking and hunting, along day and evening dresses, accessories, shoes and jewellery.\n\nKnown for expertly tailored sports and travel suits and dresses, Vera Borea came to fame with its innovative designs that promoted a new lifestyle, and acceptance of fashion sportswear as appropriate wear for other social occasions.\n\nCountess de Regoli, a passionate sportswoman born and raised in Italian Dolomites, was frustrated by a lack of clothing that was chic yet comfortable and began to design sportswear, négligées and swimming suits featuring special knitting stitch invented by her grand mother\n\nWith assistance of her friend, the British-born Princess de Rohan, the Countess located her haute-couture salon at 29 rue d’Artois, at the very end of Faubourg Saint-Honoré. With growing success, the House established in 1935 a two-story shop at 376 rue Saint Honoré, which remained open until 2007.\n\nWith a no-nonsense, hands-on approach, Countess de Regoli, an avid skier, swimmer and golfer, tried out her creations on herself before she offered them for sale, and often modelled them for clients. The designs appeared smart enough to be worn in town, reuniting sports and town wardrobes.\n\nVera Borea became soon the favorite destination on both sides of the Atlantic for women going for the new relaxed lifestyle.\n\nAmerican department stores snapped her designs and the House became the reference for garments that were simple in line but unusual in materials and cut, modern and practical. Vera Borea's creations often featured details that, beyond looking good, served a practical purpose and could be wore on multiple occasions such as after tennis, for motoring or on a shipboard.\n\nPrestigious fashion magazines featured Vera Borea's creations alongside Hermès, Lanvin, Chanel and Patou. Her designs were copied with those of Vionnet, Schiaparelli, Lanvin and Patou.\n\nScores of Americans soon joined the regular French clients at Borea's Paris salon, including famous sports women Helen Wills and Mademoiselle Suzanne Lenglen and Hollywood movie stars such as Joan Bennett.\n\nUntil the retirement of Countess de Regoli in 1962, Vera Borea was considered as one of the grand Parisian couturiers of its days and was a member of Parisian Haute-Couture.\n\nVera Borea brought a sporty aesthetic and integrated the codes of athletic wear. The House started off designing daywear, and soon became known for garments that were elegant yet dynamic, stylish yet practical. Her creations often had unusual details that served a practical purpose. Even her evening wear, which she introduced a few seasons later, avoided superfluous details and instead focused on a superb cut, a comfortable fit, and excellent workmanship.\n\nIn general, the designer favored simple but noble materials like wool, linen, hemp, and cotton, often with a textured or nubby surface. Even when she used silk, it was usually in heavy woven patterns, which Vera Borea had made in Italy.\n\nShe borrowed liberally from menswear, and regularly used wool flannel, tweeds and pinstripes for her women's suits and separates. Even ski ensembles were made of wool flannel and were often shown with an ascot or a tie. Another example of mixing men's and women's codes could be seen in an extraordinary black velvet ski suit that Borea designed in 1933, which looked like a tuxedo and closed with metallic clips that echoed those of a ski boot. The designer re-visited the theme often, like an evening wear she designed in 1945 that sported a tuxedo top and a full skirt like a ballerina's tutu… decades before \"le Smoking\" burst onto the fashion scene.\n\nA constant desire to explore and innovate permeated Vera Borea's work. She figured out how to weather-proof corduroy and used it for a raincoat. Another raincoat was made of rubber. She spun hemp with silk for travel suits and introduced in France the two-way-stretch elastic fabrics. An evening coat was made of transparent fabric. An aviator jacket was made of supple leather and a knitted back panel, making it wearable both indoors and outdoors. Shoes sported heels made of rubber. Buttons were made of Brazil nuts. Other elements like fur, raffia, rope, bone, nut, feathers, pine cones and leather also showed up in her designs.\n\nModern cuts for a modern lifestyle\n\nVera Borea's garments were ingenious on both an aesthetic and a practical level.\n\nFor example, the designer introduced high-waisted pants that skimmed the body from just below the bust down to the waist, with no belt necessary. She lowered the waistline down to the hips for a slimming line. She showed the pants with a bolero, bomber jackets, cropped sweaters or full blouses, which enhanced the elongated effect.\n\nWrap blouses and dresses did away with a need for zippers, buttons and belts. Halter tops did away with collars. Flared and gored skirts provided fullness and ease of movement while avoiding the stiffness and puffiness of a gathered waistline. Judicious draping on dresses and jackets, inverted pleats on pants, set-in panels; all continued this body-conscious philosophy. Waistbands and cuffs became ribbed and elasticized, offering more comfort and a sleeker line, as well as protection against the elements. Scarves were built into blouses or jackets, or looped through a belt. Short sleeved jackets provided both polish and practicality. Pockets freed up a woman's hands, as did chains and clips, which held a clip-on cigarette case, a visor, or a pair of gloves. Collars disappeared from coats and jackets, or were shrunk down to a simple stand-up style. Kimono cut coats closed with sashes or one or two oversized buttons. A slim ribbed turtleneck pullover became one with the body and removed the need for a scarf to keep the wearer's throat warm. Thin ribbed pullovers were layered, making them ideal for cool temperatures or outdoor sports, but also easy to peel off once inside for maximum comfort.\n\nVera Borea also made a mark with her swimsuits, which were often made from plain wool or cotton knits, and little ornament. The flair was in the details: low backs, criss-crossing straps, flared hips, discreet patterns. In 1934, the designer showed swimsuits worn under a matching skirt or flared shorts, giving women a new alternative to the fuller covering of an apron dress. With either option, a woman could simply slip on the skirt, shorts or dress over her swimsuit and go straight to lunch or jump into her car. An apron style sundress with a low back allowed women to soak up the sun's rays on the terrace of a restaurant. Pants got a cargo pocket and jackets incorporated pockets or deeply cuffed sleeves that could hold a swim cap or a wet bathing suit. The beach wear range grew to include sleeveless dresses with matching cotton coats and capri pants, oversized terry cloth lined jackets, high-waisted shorts and bra tops; with matching sandals, socks and beach bags.\n\nPassionate about skiing, swimming and golf, Borea particularly enjoyed designing sportswear because she found it so difficult to buy clothing that was chic yet comfortable and well-priced. Her 1932 sports clothes designs included a skirt and waist-length jacket made of thick woolly tricot. These were worn in combination with\nan \"open work\" inside sweater of the same color. A tweed top coat with a black belt and a loose wrap around front gave a harmonious silhouette. Paris fashion releases in the late spring were replete with frocks made of heavy black wool. Borea's black wool crepon frock had an incrusted collar and top sleeves of white shaved lamb. Her summer 1932 fashions emphasized a high-waist\neffect, even when no belt was worn. The wearer's figure was closely fit from just below her bust to the waist. Borea's day skirts had hemlines from eight to ten inches from the ground. The designer favored materials which were quite rough and open-surfaced, primarily cotton or\nwoolen ones. These were tailored into small modern suits which were worn with blouses made of dimity or crocheted Irish\nlinen thread. These featured turn down collars and muslin ties. For town wear Borea stressed rough linen fabrics and she often employed negligee materials in formal fashions. She rarely used silks, but sometimes created heavy basket or chevron (insignia) patterns, which she obtained \nhand woven from Italy. The youthful designs were without pretense and definitely were not flapperish.\n\nSummer designs revealed in February 1933 marked a milestone in Borea's designing career. From this point she no longer showed pants, with the exception of plus fours, which she styled for boating. Her very feminine sports frocks and evening gowns were quite similar, except for their\nlengths. The frocks were shorter, sixteen inches off the floor, while the evening gowns were ankle-length. Both possessed accentuated sunburn decolletes, suspended from very small ribbon-threaded metal chains. Borea lowered the waistlines of her creations to the hipbone. Her fashions began to exaggerate fullness in overblouses and the wide, flared, gored skirts she designed. Borea's bathing suits were short and flaring, made from\nplain wool or checked cotton. She created taffeta blouses with linen suits. For spring and summer Borea used knitted shoulder yokes. A white suede golf jacket she designed had a knitted white cotton yoke. \nHer mixed wool motor and travel coats featured knitted wool yokes in very dark tones. Borea's cotton or linen dresses and jackets had yokes with bright contrasts and belts of knitted wool.\n\nA novelty introduced in January 1934 was the skirted bathing suit. A skirt was worn over maillot or flaring one-piece shorts. The separate\nskirt began to outmode the fuller covering previously given by a beach apron. Borea's \"runner\" consisted of two flared panels which opened up on both sides. She used a large printed cotton handkerchief, which was popular in St. Tropez. Her creativity showed in the stylishness which she exhibited, working the scarves into new forms to cover backless frocks. Often the skirt was one color, the maillot another, and the wraplet a third. Some favored combinations were dark blue, venetian pink, and pale yellow, or Chinese blue, old rose, and beige.\n\nIn May 1935 a copy of a Borea sundress sold for $5.95 in a Los Angeles store.\nMade of cotton Indianhead, the dress left the entire back open to soak in the sun's warmth. It featured a block print with a natural background and a design of green or purple lines. The block print was also adorned with turquoise, gold, and coral (color). The sundress was fashionable to wear over a bathing suit for a luncheon indoors at a beach club.\n\nBorea's collection for fall 1935 included suits, jackets, and long redingotes, which were semi-fitted with leg-o'-mutton sleeves. Her fashions had a widening shoulder line. Her sports suits were uniquely cut in soft colored tweeds and were worn with dark crape shirts. The short sleeves on these shirts were also widened. Borea's day clothes featured a number of shades of gray-green. These were accentuated with buttons and scarves of yellow or guardsman's red. Bishop violet was a prominent color of Borea's evening wear designs. A nubby woolen, woven with bear's hair, was featured in the designer's sports wear. Her wool daytime frocks had velvet belts and trimmings. Highlights included pine-cone rosettes, which replaced sports buttons. Pheasant feathers were exhibited as trimming.\n\nIn July Borea released a white flannel suit especially for the \"sea-cum-casino\". Worn with a chali blouse, it had subtle differences with suits introduced by Lucien Lelong and other designers.\n\nBorea' silhouette was characterized by moulded bodices, normal shoulders, small waists, and short skirts, with some of them pleated and others slightly flared. She often made use of linens for beach, town, and evening wear. She frequently employed an apronline, which was either draped or tied in the back. Other prominent features of note were striped and embroidered materials (often oriental types), and colored piping (sewing). Her colorful printed frocks were worn beneath slim, dark coats.\n\nFor fall 1939 Borea styled striped necktie wool dresses. Her daytime frocks were worn with necktie wool blouses and heavy leather belts. Wool\njackets were shown with plain skirts. Full skirted dresses with shirtwaist bodices were a part of her evening wear. One design was made in red and green vertical stripes. It tucked in at the waist. Her evening gowns were inspired from portraits by Velasquez. The features included long sleeves and gold buttons, with modern shirtwaist effects.\n\nFlared basques were created by Borea for wear in the evenings. Her styles displayed screw-head\nbuttons with a contrasting color on a square cut jacket. The look was very individual.\n\nBorea's 1946 fall collection was presented on 12 September at her Paris salon, which had been redecorated with white and red and massed with red flowers. The lines of her clothing designs were simple, with natural shoulders. Fullness was eschewed except for drapery featured on a\nslim silhouette for evening. Among her fashions at the showing included a gray flannel ski suit with white leather suspenders and gold buckles. Borea introduced amber, mouse gray, and moss green corduroy box jackets over tweed suits or simple turtleneck wool dresses. Her town dresses and suits employed black wool bands or were inset with black velvet. Perhaps her most attractive ensemble in the collection was a mouse gray jacket with a plum frock.\n\nBorea designed a raincoat made from golden brown proofed corduroy. Its buttons were of embossed silver.\n\n"}

R. Martin, and the first season of the television adaptation \"Game of Thrones\".\n\nIntroduced in 1996's \"A Game of Thrones\", Viserys (along with his younger sister, Daenerys) is one of the last confirmed members of House Targaryen who, until fifteen years before the events of the first novel, ruled on the Iron Throne for nearly three hundred years.\n\nViserys is portrayed by Harry Lloyd in the HBO television adaptation.\n\nViserys Targaryen is the middle child and younger son of Aerys II Targaryen, also known as The Mad King, and his sister-wife Rhaella Targaryen.\n\nViserys Targaryen is the second born son of Aerys II Targaryen. Thirteen years before the events of the series, he and his sister Daenerys fled Westeros to escape death at the hands of rebel Robert Baratheon. Viserys is an arrogant, cruel and ambitious man given to violent mood swings. In \"A Game of Thrones\", he sells his sister as a wife to the Dothraki Khal Drogo, as a means to secure the allegiance of Drogo's army toward his goal of reclaiming the throne. Frustrated with Drogo, Viserys demands a crown and threatens Daenerys and her unborn child; Drogo kills him by pouring a pot of molten gold over his head.\n\nDaenerys later names one of her dragons Viserion, after Viserys. She explains that in spite of everything, he was still her brother, and that his draconic namesake will help do what he could not. She also tries to remember him as the good person he was before the stresses of their exile made him violent and bitter, and acknowledges that he at least kept her alive and safe through her childhood.\n\nViserys Targaryen is the exiled prince and heir of the Targaryen dynasty. Known as \"The Beggar King\" for his search for an army to recapture his throne. A narcissist, he is arrogant and self-centered, caring only about himself and looking down on others, especially his sister Daenerys. In exchange for an army to help regain the Iron Throne, Viserys marries off his sister to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo in the first episode, \"Winter Is Coming\", and follows his horde's journey to the Dothraki capital to ensure Drogo will keep his end of the bargain. But as they journey, it becomes evident that Viserys does not have any leadership skills to reclaim the throne as his arrogance and disrespect for the Dothraki does not win him any hearts. Furthermore, Daenerys, whom he has always threatened throughout his life, starts to stand up to him. Realizing that Daenerys is loved by the Dothraki and that her and Drogo's unborn son are prophesied to unite the world, Viserys realizes that it is not he but Daenerys who will reclaim the Iron Throne. In the sixth episode, \"A Golden Crown\", he gets in a fit of drunken rage, threatens Drogo to give him his army and crown or he will kill his sister and her unborn son. Having had enough of his behavior, Drogo kills Viserys by giving him a \"Golden Crown\"; molten gold poured over his head. Daenerys watches her brother's agonizing death, proclaiming that he wasn't a true dragon, as \"fire cannot kill a dragon\".\n\nDaenerys later names one of her dragons Viserion, as a tribute to Viserys, although the reasoning is not explained on-screen.\n\nViserys Targaryen is played by British actor Harry Lloyd in the television adaption of the books.\nViserys Targaryen is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of his sister Daenerys.\n\nHarry Lloyd on Viserys Targaryen:\n\nAs soon as I looked into more of the history of the Targaryen family and actually read the other books, I found out more and pieced together his backstory, and he became sympathetic. I understood more what motivated him, and the fear he had, and the responsibility he had, and his childishness. I mean, he never really had a parent. That changed a lot my view from reading it to playing it.\n\nLloyd on his character’s death scene:\n\nI've never had to die on camera before, let alone in such a grisly way. So you just have to kind of give it everything. You talk to the two actors holding you and say, ‘Let's not pansy around here. I'm gonna absolutely try and get out of this, so don't let me.' Then, you let it rip. It can't be some sort of half-assed whimpering – you've got to really believe the pain and the fear. It's actually quite liberating.\n\nLloyd has received positive reviews for his role as Viserys in the TV-series.\n"}
{"id": "476029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=476029", "title": "White Tree of Gondor", "text": "White Tree of Gondor\n\nIn J. R. R. Tolkien's high fantasy universe of Middle-earth, the White Tree of Gondor stood as a symbol of Gondor in the Court of the Fountain in Minas Tirith.\nThe White Tree also appears as a motif upon Gondor's flag and throughout its heraldry combined with the seven stars of the House of Elendil and the crown of the King.\n\nThe first White Tree of Gondor came from a fruit that Isildur, at great personal risk, managed to steal from Nimloth the Fair, the White Tree of Númenor, before it was destroyed at Sauron's insistence. He suffered many wounds at this mission, and he came near death, but when the first leaf of the planted fruit opened in the spring, Isildur was healed of his wounds.\n\nThis sapling was brought to Middle-earth on Isildur's ship, and it was eventually planted in Minas Ithil before the house of Isildur. But when Sauron returned to Middle-earth, he launched a sudden attack that captured Minas Ithil, and he destroyed the White Tree.\n\nIsildur escaped the capture of Minas Ithil, taking with him a sapling of the White Tree to Minas Anor where it was planted in the citadel courtyard in memory of his slain brother Anárion. This tree died in 1636 during the Great Plague.\n\nA third sapling was planted in the year 1640 of the Third Age by King Tarondor. This one lasted until the year 2872 and the death of the Ruling Steward Belecthor II.\n\nAt this time no seedling of the tree could be found as the tree had rarely flowered after the line of the Kings had failed and therefore no fruit was produced. It was left standing after its death \"until the King returns\".\n\nWhen Aragorn became king he discovered (with Gandalf's help) a sapling of the White Tree upon the slopes of Mindolluin, high above the city, which he reverently planted in the Court of the Fountain. The dead tree was removed from the court but was placed in the Tombs of the Kings with all the honour that would normally be accorded a fallen monarch. In June of the year 3019 of the Third Age the sapling was already laden with blossom.\n\nThe finding of the sapling is not seen in Peter Jackson's \"\" (2003). However, in the film we momentarily see a single blossom of \"hope\" on the previously dead tree during the Siege of Gondor and the imminent arrival of Aragorn on the Black Ships. At the time of the crowning of Aragorn the previously dead tree has returned to life and is in full blossom.\n"}
