{"id": "38979885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38979885", "title": "\"Holy...\"", "text": "\"Holy...\"\n\n\"Holy…!\" (for example \"Holy cow!\", \"Holy mackerel!\" or \"Holy smoke!\") is an exclamation of surprise used mostly in English-speaking countries.\n\nRobin of the \"Batman\" TV series is noted for his many catchphrase \"Holy…\" exclamations. The lines in the 1960s TV series were uttered by Burt Ward who played Robin, who delivered the exclamations in a nasal voice. Many of the camp quips are directly related to the plot; for example, \"Holy Graf Zeppelin!\" is uttered by Robin upon seeing an aerial balloon.\n\nAccording to New York wellness expert Scott A. Morofsky, Robin would \"inevitably refer to an intense experience with a loud, 'Holy... Batman, what do we do now?'\". Bradley J. Ricca, comic book scholar at Case Western Reserve University, suggests that: \"Robin exists as a media entity inextricably linked with Batman and shares nearly as much ubiquity in American culture\". He considers Robin's famous \"Holy...\" catchphrases to have been grossly overused in the series, popularizing it in the American vernacular. Cartoons such as \"The Super Friends\" continued to make use of Robin and his catchphrases, \"spouting 'Holy' in front of every noun imaginable\" and Robin's exclamations still remain closely associated with his character in popular culture.\n\nAmerican author David Shields notes how much in contrast Robin's \"Holy...\" outbursts, his alliteration and assonance, his fast riffs\" were to the laconic Batman. According to film critics Deborah Cartmell and Imelda Whelehan, Robin's quip \"Holey Rusted Metal!\" in \"Batman Forever\" was an \"explicit in-joke\". Camp humour, through Robin's exclamations and other circumstances in the Batman series, have led some commentators to speculate on homosexual undertones in the relationship between Batman and Robin. Image Entertainment paid homage to Robin's quips with the title \"Batman: Holy Batmania\" in a 2004 2-disc DVD release containing four documentaries discussing the sixties TV series. The DVD title is the name of one of the documentaries itself.\n\n\n"}

It is the second novel in the French-Italian plot thread, which began with \"\" and was published by Baen Books in 2006. The book explores the reactions of the Roman Catholic hardliners to Pope Urban VIII's actions in tolerating the new freedom of religion taking root in Central Europe during the climax of \"The Galileo Affair\".\n\nLike all the preceding books in the series, it is set in the Thirty Years' War. The series deals with history and political life, American culture and a host of other things taken for granted in today's First World countries.\n\nFollowing the events of \"1634: The Galileo Affair\", Pope Urban VIII had been won over to the actions of the Americans after being saved from his attempted assassination and his subsequent pardon of Galileo Galilei. However, Pope Urban's relations with the Americans and their allies earned the scorn of his historical enemy Cardinal Gaspar Borja y Velasco, who had been loudly critical of the actions, or inactions, of the Holy See in regard to Gustavus Adolphus, Galileo, and now Cardinal Larry Mazzare, and had been briefly banned from Rome by Urban.\n\nCardinal Borja returned to Rome, though living in the outskirts of the city, and having cultivated allies with the Spanish element of the Vatican and acquiring the aid of Francisco de Quevedo y Villega, a mercenary agent provocateur, is ordered by King Philip IV of Spain to stir up trouble within Rome with the efforts of discrediting Urban and turning him into a lame duck pope after Urban failed to support Spain in her war against the United States of Europe (USE). Borja exceeds these orders, orchestrating a military coup to overthrow Urban, which also caused the deaths of Urban's political allies including his cardinal-nephew Antonio Barberini, and replace him with a Spanish puppet. Urban escaped from his second attempted death with the help from the American Roman embassy, leading to Borja being declared an Anti-Pope, with only Spain and its satellites recognizing his authority as the new Pope.\n\nPublishers Weekly was somewhat critical in their review saying \"If this novel is not as rollicking as its predecessor, that may be because there really isn't anything funny about the Spanish Inquisition, Monty Python notwithstanding.\" Roland Green reviewing for Booklist was more positive saying \"this is probably the strongest book in the magnificent saga since the opening volume 1632.\" The reviewer or SFRevu wrote that \"the book has that iceburg feeling of inevitability\" and that the \"people of 1635 may be trying to get out of the path history set for them, but they're still driven by the same events and pressures that decided their fates the first time.\"\n\n1635: The Cannon Law was listed on the Locus (magazine) Hardcovers Bestsellers List for two months in a row at the end of 2006 and the beginning of 2007, topping at number 8.\n"}

{"id": "1982470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982470", "title": "Asian Babes", "text": "Asian Babes\n\nAsian Babes was a British softcore pornographic magazine which featured photographs of women of South Asian, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Thai origin. The magazine was launched in March 1992 and initially used only Indian and Pakistani models from the United Kingdom. Later, Asian models from other countries were also included. The magazine was initially published by Northern & Shell, a newspaper and magazine publishing group owned by the businessman Richard Desmond. In 2004 Northern & Shell sold the magazine to Remnant Media, a publishing company which produced a number of other pornographic magazines. Remnant went into administration in 2007 and the magazine was then bought by Trojan Publishing and subsequently by Interactive Publishing. \"Asian Babes\" had ceased publication by 2012.\n\nIn 1983, Northern & Shell obtained the licence to publish \"Penthouse\" in the United Kingdom which led to its development of a portfolio of adult titles, with \"Asian Babes\" being among them. It was one of the first British pornographic magazines to feature Asian models, and was initially published on an experimental basis. It was, however, an immediate success, with sales of 160,000 copies. The company was also responsible for the release of \"Electric Blue\" softcore pornography videos titled \"Asian Babes\" in 1993. According to a 1995 survey by the magazine, most of its readers were white men.\n\n\"Asian Babes\", along with other titles such as \"Readers' Wives\", was part of Desmond's portfolio of soft-porn magazines which was offered for sale in 2001. There were concerns that some investors were reluctant to invest in pornography, and that the market for such magazines was changing. \"Asian Babes\" was finally sold in 2004 as part of a package of 45 titles to Remnant Media for a reported £20 million (approximately US$39 million). After the magazine had been sold, the Bank of Scotland issued an apology for having loaned £5 million (US$9.8 million) to Remnant Media in order to facilitate the purchase. Remnant Media went into administration in 2007 and the title was bought by Trojan Publishing and subsequently Interactive Publishing. The magazine had ceased publication by 2012.\n\nThe publication of \"Asian Babes\" caused controversy in the British Asian community. Models came into conflict with their families and boycotts were organised against newsagents selling the magazine.\n\nDesmond's ownership of the porn magazines was often criticized and frequently used to bolster criticism of his business practices. Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, a columnist for \"The Independent\" in London, England, characterized Desmond as \"the seedy porn baron who gives this nation \"Mega Boobs\" and \"Asian Babes\" and other yuck and muck\". The column criticized the way in which Desmond had made use of the \"Daily Express\"; Alibhai-Brown's column was not focused on Desmond's publishing activities with regard to pornography. She went on to say: \"Actually, I am less bothered about the porn mags than many... I made myself look at \"Asian Babes\" and it is true that the 'babes' themselves look exceedingly full of life, not pushed into any of the poses\".\n\nInformation about Desmond's ownership of \"Asian Babes\" and other adult magazines was included in a BBC Online 2004 profile which spoke to the controversy surrounding his ownership of \"top-shelf\" (pornographic) magazines at the same time he was attempting to purchase \"The Daily Telegraph\".\n\n"}

{"id": "42411202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42411202", "title": "Bro (subculture)", "text": "Bro (subculture)\n\nBro is a subculture of young men who spend time partying with others like themselves. Although the popular image of bro lifestyle is associated with sports apparel and fraternities, it lacks a consistent definition. Most aspects vary regionally such as in California where it overlaps with surf culture. Oxford Dictionaries have noted that bros frequently self-identify with neologisms containing the word \"bro\" as a prefix or suffix. In a \"New York Magazine\" article in September 2013, Ann Friedman wrote: \"\"Bro\" once meant something specific: a self-absorbed young white guy in board shorts with a taste for cheap beer. But it’s become a shorthand for the sort of privileged ignorance that thrives in groups dominated by wealthy, white, straight men.\"\n\nBro was originally an abbreviated form of \"brother\" but began to assume non-familial connotations in the 20th century. In this evolution, it was first used to refer to another man, such as a \"guy\" or \"fellow\", or sometimes, specifically, a black man. In these ways, it was semantically similar to the use of \"brother\". In the 1970s, bro came to refer to a male friend rather than just another man. The word became associated with young men who spend time partying with others like themselves. Oxford Dictionaries identified the use of the term \"bro\" as the one \"defining feature\" of the changing cultural attributes of young manhood.\n\nThe applications of bro subculture correlate with neologisms that include the word. The word is used as a modifier for compound terms such as \"brogrammer\" and \"curlbro\". The word \"brah\" is used similarly, and is sometimes combined as \"bro-brahs\", other variations exist such as: bruh or breh. Oxford Dictionaries wrote that the term \"lends itself\" to compounding and blending, with combinations such as \"bro-hug\" and \"bro-step\" and portmanteaux such as \"bro-down\", \"bromance\", and \"brohemian\". This creation of neologisms was called \"portmanbros\" by 2009. Oxford Dictionaries compared this trend to man- prefixes (e.g., man cave, mansplaining, manscaping) but noted that the bro portmanteaux subset refers to a smaller portion of masculinity. Oxford Dictionaries also noted that many of the terms were \"stunt coinages\" with little hope of widespread adoption. However, the term \"bromance\", whose first usage was recorded in a 2001 issue of \"TransWorld Surf\", entered the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". The term \"bro-hug\" was used at least eight times in \"The New York Times\" between 2010 and 2013 and \"brogrammer\" once became the center of Silicon Valley gender conversations. In comparison to the \"hipster\" modifier, Oxford Dictionaries called the \"bro\" modifier more playful, and responsible for making the subculture \"ripe for (often self-inflicted) mockery\".\n\nOxford Dictionaries identifies bros metonymously as those who themselves use the word to refer to others, such as in the example of \"don't tase me, bro\", in which the taser is not a bro, but the tased is. The subculture is not defined consistently or concretely, but refers to a type of \"fratty masculinity\", predominantly \"if not exclusively\" white, associated with frayed-brim baseball hats, oxford shirts, sports team T-shirts, cargo shorts, and boat shoes or sandals. NPR also noted that bros could include people of color and women, though that is not the popular conception of bro subculture. Oxford Dictionaries recognized Barney Stinson's character on the sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother\" as \"the quintessence of a certain iteration of the contemporary bro\" and noted how his language uses the word liberally. A survey from NPR's Codeswitch blog named popular figures such as Matthew McConaughey, Brody Jenner, Joe Rogan, Dane Cook, and John Mayer as representative of bro subculture, with Ryan Lochte as their \"platonic ideal of bro-dom\".\n\nThe wide-ranging iterations of bro include \"twenty-something investment bankers\", fraternity brothers in flannel shirts, and \"laconic surfers\". NPR identified four types of bros: dudely, jockish, preppy, and stoner-ish. In their description, dudely bros form close and homosocial friendships in a group of bros, jockish bros are defined by ability at team sports tempered by interest in alcohol, preppy bros wear \"conservatively casual\" clothes such as Abercrombie and Fitch (and are the sons of Brooks Brothers-wearing men) and flaunt \"social privilege\", and stoner-ish bros may not get high but speak relaxedly and exude the air of surfers.\n\nLax bro subculture is defined as a laid-back (\"chill\") lifestyle associated with lacrosse. The bounds of the subculture are loose, but its character traits include \"understated confidence that critics call arrogance\", long hair (known as \"lettuce\"), colorful board shorts, flat-brim baseball hats, and colorful half-calf socks. The bands O.A.R., Dispatch, and Dave Matthews Band are associated with lax bros. Typical lax bro \"attitude and style\" are common in middle schools and universities according to a 2012 report in \"The Boston Globe\". Enthusiasts praise the subculture's \"sense of identity\" and popularization of a sport indigenous to the United States, while detractors take issue with the \"preppie/frat boy image that glories elitism and wealth, and values flash over hard work\". The gay community has coined the term \"gaybro\".\n\nIn 2013, former Microsoft game designer Daniel Cook wrote that the company was responsible for developing the bro subculture within video gaming, explaining that the \"Xbox put machismo, ultra-violence and chimpboys with backwards caps in the spotlight. [...] Gamers were handed a pre-packaged group identity via the propaganda machine of a mega corporation.\" Cook writes that Microsoft has done this in order to distance the Xbox from its console competitors, which were portrayed as \"kids platform[s]\".\n\n"}

{"id": "24083702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24083702", "title": "Criticism of multiculturalism", "text": "Criticism of multiculturalism\n\nCriticism of multiculturalism questions the ideal of the maintenance of distinct ethnic cultures within a country. Multiculturalism is a particular subject of debate in certain European nations that are associated with the idea of a single nation within their country. Critics of multiculturalism may argue against cultural integration of different ethnic and cultural groups to the existing laws and values of the country. Alternatively critics may argue for assimilation of different ethnic and cultural groups to a single national identity.\n\nRifts within Australian society, right through history, whether between the continent's Indigenous people and the European settler population or, in recent times, inter-ethnic tension manifest in the form of riots, street violence and ethnic gangs pose major challenges to multiculturalism in the country.\n\nThe response to multiculturalism in Australia has been varied. A nationalist, anti-mass immigration party, the One Nation Party, was formed by Pauline Hanson in the late 1990s. The party enjoyed brief electoral success, most notably in its home state of Queensland, but became electorally marginalized until its resurgence in 2016. In the late 1990s, One Nation called for the abolition of multiculturalism alleging that it represented \"a threat to the very basis of the Australian culture, identity and shared values\", arguing that there was \"no reason why migrant cultures should be maintained at the expense of our shared, national culture.\"\n\nAn Australian Federal Government proposal in 2006 to introduce a compulsory citizenship test, which would assess English skills and knowledge of Australian values, sparked renewed debate over the future of multiculturalism in Australia. Andrew Robb, then Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, told a conference in November 2006 that some Australians worried the term \"multicultural\" had been transformed by interest groups into a philosophy that put \"allegiances to original culture ahead of national loyalty, a philosophy which fosters separate development, a federation of ethnic cultures, not one community\". He added: \"A community of separate cultures fosters a rights mentality, rather than a responsibilities mentality. It is divisive. It works against quick and effective integration.\" However, criticism of multiculturalism in Australia has also emerged in the context of a construction of a binary \"us\" vs. \"them\" discourse. Such discourse was employed in the 2001 election by the Coalition (a formal alliance between the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia) as it expressed its views on immigration: \"We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.\" This discourse was mired in anti-elitism and populism, as John Howard sought to appeal to the \"fears, resentments and insecurities\" of \"ordinary Australians.\" The discourse further included a backlash against \"boat people,\" particularly refugees from Malaysia, who were accused of trying to \"exploit our compassion and generosity.\" The Australian citizenship test commenced in October 2007 for all new citizens between the ages of 18 and 60.\n\nIn January 2007 the Howard Government removed the word \"multicultural\" from the name of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, changing its name to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.\n\nThe earliest academic critics of multiculturalism in Australia were the philosophers Lachlan Chipman and Frank Knopfelmacher, sociologist Tanya Birrell and the political scientist Raymond Sestito. Chipman and Knopfelmacher were concerned with threats to social cohesion, while Birrell's concern was that multiculturalism obscures the social costs associated with large scale immigration that fall most heavily on the most recently arrived and unskilled immigrants. Sestito's arguments were based on the role of political parties. He argued that political parties were instrumental in pursuing multicultural policies, and that these policies would put strain on the political system and would not promote better understanding in the Australian community.\n\nIt was the high-profile historian Geoffrey Blainey, however, who first achieved mainstream recognition for the anti-multiculturalist cause when he wrote that multiculturalism threatened to transform Australia into a \"cluster of tribes\". In his 1984 book \"All for Australia\", Blainey criticised multiculturalism for tending to \"emphasise the rights of ethnic minorities at the expense of the majority of Australians\" and also for tending to be \"anti-British\", even though \"people from the United Kingdom and Ireland form the dominant class of pre-war immigrants and the largest single group of post-war immigrants.\"\n\nAccording to Blainey, such a policy, with its \"emphasis on what is different and on the rights of the new minority rather than the old majority,\" was unnecessarily creating division and threatened national cohesion. He argued that \"the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high\" and warned that \"we should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world.\"\n\nIn one of his numerous criticisms of multiculturalism, Blainey wrote:\n\nFor the millions of Australians who have no other nation to fall back upon, multiculturalism is almost an insult. It is divisive. It threatens social cohesion. It could, in the long-term, also endanger Australia's military security because it sets up enclaves which in a crisis could appeal to their own homelands for help.\n\nBlainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism into the 1990s, denouncing multiculturalism as \"morally, intellectually and economically ... a sham\".\n\nThe late historian John Hirst was another intellectual critic of multiculturalism. He has argued that while multiculturalism might serve the needs of ethnic politics and the demands of certain ethnic groups for government funding for the promotion of their separate ethnic identity, it was a perilous concept on which to base national policy.\n\nCritics associated with the Centre for Population and Urban Research at Monash University have argued that both Right and Left factions in the Australian Labor Party have adopted a multicultural stance for the purposes of increasing their support within the party. A manifestation of this embrace of multiculturalism has been the creation of ethnic branches within the Labor Party and ethnic branch stacking.\n\nFollowing the upsurge of support for the One Nation Party in 1996, Lebanese-born Australian anthropologist Ghassan Hage published a critique in 1997 of Australian multiculturalism in the book \"White Nation\".\n\nAustralian political ethologist Frank Salter, author of \"\", has argued that multiculturalism forms \"part of an ideological-administrative system that is helping swamp the Australian nation through ethnically diverse immigration.\" This, in turn, is \"putting at risk the nation's ability to produce the public goods that nations excel in producing: relative cohesion and harmony, public altruism, trust, efficient government and political stability.\"\n\nSalter has written:\n\nDiversity is not the only deleterious side effect of multiculturalism. Another is to perpetuate population growth because immigration is part of the quid pro quo offered ethnic minorities in exchange for votes. Perpetual large scale immigration cannot be sustained for well-rehearsed environmental reasons. In the end failure to regulate population growth causes severe suffering and social and economic dislocation. It follows that multiculturalism should be counteracted as part of a responsible population policy. The conflict between the two policies is already evident. The charge of racism is often directed at recommendations for reducing immigration overall, even without changing the ethnic mix.\n\nIn Salter's view, the current model of multiculturalism is flawed as it tends to be \"asymmetrical\" and exclude Australia's historic Anglo-Celtic majority as a legitimate interest group.\n\nIn contrast to the multicultural doctrine which promotes ethnic diversity, Salter has expounded the case for limiting diversity within the nation-state, asserting that \"multi-ethnic societies are often confronted with the problem of discrimination and group conflict.\" . According to Salter:\n\nCross-cultural comparisons reveal the wisdom of Australia's first prime minister Edmund Barton who believed that ethnic homogeneity must be the cornerstone of Australian nation-building. More ethnically homogeneous nations are better able to build public goods, are more democratic, less corrupt, have higher productivity and less inequality, are more trusting and care more for the disadvantaged, develop social and economic capital faster, have lower crime rates, are more resistant to external shocks, and are better global citizens, for example by giving more foreign aid. Moreover, they are less prone to civil war, the greatest source of violent death in the twentieth century.\n\n Many Québécois, despite an official national bilingualism policy, insist that multiculturalism threatens to reduce them to just another ethnic group. Quebec's policy seeks to promote interculturalism, welcoming people of all origins while insisting that they integrate into Quebec's majority French-speaking society. In 2008, a Consultation Commission on Accommodation Practices Related to Cultural Differences, headed by sociologist Gerard Bouchard and philosopher Charles Taylor, recognized that Quebec is a \"de facto\" pluralist society, but that the Canadian multiculturalism model \"does not appear well suited to conditions in Quebec\".\n\nAccording to a study conducted by The University of Victoria, many Canadians do not feel a strong sense of belonging in Canada, or cannot integrate themselves into society as a result of ethnic enclaves. Many immigrants to Canada choose to live in ethnic enclaves because it can be much easier than fitting in with mainstream Canadian culture.\n\nForeign born Canadian, Neil Bissoondath in his book \"\", argues that official multiculturalism limits the freedom of minority members, by confining them to cultural and geographic ethnic enclaves. He also argues that cultures are very complex, and must be transmitted through close family and kin relations. To him, the government view of cultures as being about festivals and cuisine is a crude oversimplification that leads to easy stereotyping.\n\nCanadian Daniel Stoffman's book \"Who Gets In\" questions the policy of Canadian multiculturalism. Stoffman points out that many cultural practices, such as allowing dog meat to be served in restaurants and street cockfighting, are simply incompatible with Canadian and Western culture. He also raises concern about the number of recent immigrants who are not being linguistically integrated into Canada (i.e., not learning either English or French). He stresses that multiculturalism works better in theory than in practice and Canadians need to be far more assertive about valuing the \"national identity of English-speaking Canada\".\n\nCanadian Joseph Garcea explores the validity of attacks on multiculturalism because it supposedly segregates the peoples of Canada; multiculturalism hurts the Canadian, Québécois, and Aboriginal culture, identity, and nationalism projects; and, it perpetuates conflicts between and within groups. Oxford sociologist, Reza Hasmath, argues that the multicultural project in Canada has the potential to hinder substantive equality in the labour market for ethnic minorities.\n\nCriticisms of parallel societies established by some immigrant communities increasingly came to the fore in the German public discourse during the 1990s, giving rise to the concept of the Leitkultur (\"lead culture\"). In October 2010, amid a nationwide controversy about Thilo Sarrazin's bestselling book \"Deutschland schafft sich ab\" (\"Germany is abolishing Itself\"), chancellor Angela Merkel of the conservative Christian Democratic Union judged attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany to have \"failed, utterly failed\". She added: \"The concept that we are now living side by side and are happy about it does not work\". She continued to say that immigrants should integrate and adopt Germany's culture and values. This has added to a growing debate within Germany on the levels of immigration, its effect on the country and the degree to which Muslim immigrants have integrated into German society. According to one poll around the time, one-third of Germans believed the country was \"overrun by foreigners\".\n\nItaly has recently seen a substantial rise in immigration and an influx of African immigrants. \n\nMany intellectuals have opposed multiculturalism among those:<br>\n\nIda Magli, professor emeritus of cultural anthropology at the University of Rome. She was a contributor to the weekly \"L'Espresso\" and was a columnist for the daily \"La Repubblica\". She expressed criticism of multicultural societies.<br>\n\nOriana Fallaci was an Italian journalist, author, and political interviewer. A partisan during World War II, she had a long and successful journalistic career. Fallaci became famous worldwide for her coverage of war and revolution, and her interviews with many world leaders during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. After retirement, she returned to the spotlight after writing a series of controversial articles and books critical of Islam and immigration.\n\nJapanese society, with its homogeneity, has traditionally rejected any need to recognize ethnic differences in Japan, even as such claims have been rejected by such ethnic minorities as the Ainu and Ryukyuans. Former Japanese Prime Minister (Deputy Prime Minister as of 26 December 2012) Taro Aso has called Japan a \"one race\" nation.\n\nMalaysia is a multicultural society with a Muslim Malay majority and substantial Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indian minorities. Criticisms of multiculturalism have been periodically sparked by the entrenched constitutional position the Malay ethnicity enjoys through, \"inter alia\", the Malaysian social contract. Contrary to other countries, in Malaysia affirmative action are often tailored to the needs of the Malay majority population. In 2006, the forced removal of Hindu temples across the country has led to accusations of \"an unofficial policy of Hindu temple-cleansing in Malaysia\".\n\nLegal philosopher Paul Cliteur attacked multiculturalism in his book \"The Philosophy of Human Rights\". Cliteur rejects all political correctness on the issue: Western culture, the \"Rechtsstaat\" (rule of law), and human rights are superior to non-Western culture and values. They are the product of the Enlightenment. Cliteur sees non-Western cultures not as merely different but as anachronistic. He sees multiculturalism primarily as an unacceptable ideology of cultural relativism, which would lead to acceptance of barbaric practices, including those brought to the Western World by immigrants. Cliteur lists infanticide, torture, slavery, oppression of women, homophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, gangs, female genital cutting, discrimination \"by\" immigrants, suttee, and the death penalty. Cliteur compares multiculturalism to the moral acceptance of Auschwitz, Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot and the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nIn 2000, Paul Scheffer—a member of the Labour Party and subsequently a professor of urban studies—published his essay \"The multicultural tragedy\", an essay critical of both immigration and multiculturalism. Scheffer is a committed supporter of the nation-state, assuming that homogeneity and integration are necessary for a society: the presence of immigrants undermines this. A society does have a finite \"absorptive capacity\" for those from other cultures, he says, but this has been exceeded in the Netherlands. He specifically cites failure to assimilate, spontaneous ethnic segregation, adaptation problems such as school drop-out, unemployment, and high crime rates (see immigration and crime), and opposition to secularism among Muslim immigrants as the main problems resulting from immigration.\n\nWith considerable immigration after the Second World War making the UK an increasingly ethnically and racially diverse state, race relations policies have been developed that broadly reflect the principles of multiculturalism, although there is no official national commitment to the concept. This model has faced criticism on the grounds that it has failed to sufficiently promote social integration, although some commentators have questioned the dichotomy between diversity and integration that this critique presumes. It has been argued that the UK government has since 2001, moved away from policy characterised by multiculturalism and towards the assimilation of minority communities.\n\nOpposition has grown to state sponsored multicultural policies, with some believing that it has been a costly failure. Critics of the policy come from many parts of British society. There is now a debate in the UK over whether explicit multiculturalism and \"social cohesion and inclusion\" are in fact mutually exclusive. In the wake of the 7 July 2005 London bombings David Davis, the opposition Conservative shadow home secretary, called on the government to scrap its \"outdated\" policy of multiculturalism.\n\nThe British columnist Leo McKinstry has persistently criticized multiculturalism, stating that \"Britain is now governed by a suicide cult bent on wiping out any last vestige of nationhood\" and called multiculturalism a \"profoundly disturbing social experiment\".\n\nMcKinstry also wrote:\n\nWe are paying a terrible price for the creed of Left-wing politicians. They pose as champions of progress yet their fixation with multiculturalism is dragging us into a new dark age. In many of our cities, social solidarity is being replaced by divisive tribalism, democracy by identity politics. Real integration is impossible when ethnic groups are encouraged to cling to customs, practices, even languages from their homeland.\n\nTrevor Phillips, the head of the Commission for Racial Equality, who has called for an official end to multicultural policy, has criticised \"politically correct liberals for their \"misguided\" pandering to the ethnic lobby\".\n\nJournalist Ed West argued in his 2013 book, \"The Diversity Illusion\", that the British political establishment had uncritically embraced multiculturalism without proper consideration of the downsides of ethnic diversity. He wrote:\n\nEveryone in a position of power held the same opinion. Diversity was a good in itself, so making Britain truly diverse would enrich it and bring 'significant cultural contributions', reflecting a widespread belief among the ruling classes that multiculturalism and cultural, racial and religious diversity were morally positive things whatever the consequences. This is the unthinking assumption held by almost the entire political, media and education establishment. It is the diversity illusion.\n\nWest has also argued:\n\nAdvocates of multiculturalism argue that immigrants prefer to stick together because of racism and the fear of racial violence, as well as the bonds of community. This is perfectly reasonable, but if this is the case, why not the same for natives too? If multiculturalism is right because minorities feel better among themselves, why have mass immigration at all, since it must obviously make everyone miserable? (And if diversity 'enriches' and strengthens, why integrate, since that will only reduce diversity?) All the arguments for multiculturalism—that people feel safer, more comfortable among people of the same group, and that they need their own cultural identity—are arguments against immigration, since English people must also feel the same. If people categorised as \"white Britons\" are not afforded that indulgence because they are a majority, do they attain it when they become a minority?\n\nIn the May 2004 edition of \"Prospect Magazine\", the editor David Goodhart temporarily couched the debate on multiculturalism in terms of whether a modern welfare state and a \"good society\" is sustainable as its citizens become increasingly diverse.\n\nIn November 2005 John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York, stated, \"Multiculturalism has seemed to imply, wrongly for me: let other cultures be allowed to express themselves but do not let the majority culture at all tell us its glories, its struggles, its joys, its pains.\" The Bishop of Rochester Michael Nazir-Ali was also critical, calling for the Church to regain a prominent position in public life and blaming the \"newfangled and insecurely founded doctrine of multiculturalism\" for entrenching the segregation of communities.\n\nWhilst minority cultures are allowed to remain distinct, British culture and traditions are sometimes perceived as exclusive and adapted accordingly, often without the consent of the local population. For instance, Birmingham City Council was heavily criticised when it was alleged to have renamed Christmas as \"Winterval\" in 1998, although in truth it had done no such thing.\n\nIn August 2006, the community and local government secretary Ruth Kelly made a speech perceived as signalling the end of multiculturalism as official policy. In November 2006, Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that Britain has certain \"essential values\" and that these are a \"duty\". He did not reject multiculturalism outright, but he included British heritage among the essential values:\n\nWhen it comes to our essential values—belief in democracy, the rule of law, tolerance, equal treatment for all, respect for this country and its shared heritage—then that is where we come together, it is what we hold in common.\n\nRenewed controversy on the subject came to the fore when Andrew Neather—a former adviser to Jack Straw, Tony Blair and David Blunkett—said that Labour ministers had a hidden agenda in allowing mass immigration into Britain, to \"change the face of Britain forever\". This alleged conspiracy has become known by the sobriquet \"Neathergate\".\n\nAccording to Neather, who was present at closed meetings in 2000, a secret Government report called for mass immigration to change Britain's cultural make-up, and that \"mass immigration was the way that the government was going to make the UK truly multicultural\".\nNeather went on to say that \"the policy was intended—even if this wasn't its main purpose — to rub the right's nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date\".\n\nThis was later affirmed after a request through the freedom of information act secured access to the full version of a 2000 government report on immigration that had been heavily edited on a previous release. The Conservative party demanded an independent inquiry into the issue and alleged that the document showed that Labour had overseen a deliberate open-door policy on immigration to boost multiculturalism for political ends.\n\nIn February 2011, the then Prime Minister David Cameron stated that the \"doctrine of state multiculturalism\" (promoted by the previous Labour government) had failed and will no longer be state policy. He stated that the UK needed a stronger national identity and signalled a tougher stance on groups promoting Islamist extremism. However, official statistics showed that EU and non-EU mass immigration, together with asylum seeker applications, all increased substantially during Cameron's term in office.\n\nThe U.S. Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act in 1921, followed by the Immigration Act of 1924. The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at further restricting the Southern and Eastern Europeans, especially Italians and Slavs, who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s many criticisms were expressed, from both the left and right. Criticisms come from a wide variety of perspectives, but predominantly from the perspective of liberal individualism, from American conservatives concerned about shared traditional values, and from a national unity perspective.\n\nA prominent criticism in the US, later echoed in Europe, Canada and Australia, was that multiculturalism undermined national unity, hindered social integration and cultural assimilation, and led to the fragmentation of society into several ethnic factions (Balkanization).\n\nIn 1991, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., a former advisor to the Kennedy and other US administrations and Pulitzer Prize winner, published a book critical of multiculturalism with the title \"\".\n\nIn his 1991 work, \"Illiberal Education\", Dinesh D'Souza argues that the entrenchment of multiculturalism in American universities undermined the universalist values that liberal education once attempted to foster. In particular, he was disturbed by the growth of ethnic studies programs (e.g., black studies).\n\nThe late Samuel P. Huntington, political scientist and author, known for his Clash of Civilizations theory, described multiculturalism as \"basically an anti-Western ideology.\" According to Huntington, multiculturalism had \"attacked the identification of the United States with Western civilization, denied the existence of a common American culture, and promoted racial, ethnic, and other subnational cultural identities and groupings.\" Huntington outlined the risks he associated with multiculturalism in his 2004 book \"Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity\".\n\nMulticulturalism has also been attacked through satire, such as the following proposition by John Derbyshire.\nThe Diversity Theorem: Groups of people from anywhere in the world, mixed together in any numbers and proportions whatsoever, will eventually settle down as a harmonious society, appreciating—nay, celebrating!—their differences... which will of course soon disappear entirely. \n\nThis theorem is held to be false by Derbyshire and other paleoconservatives.\n\nThe late Lawrence Auster, another conservative critic of multiculturalism, argued that although multiculturalism was meant to promote the value of each culture, its real tendency had been to undermine US traditional majority culture. In Auster's view, multiculturalism tended to \"downgrade our national culture while raising the status and power of other cultures.\"\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThe formal meaning of \"diversity,\" \"cultural equity,\" \"gorgeous mosaic\" and so on is a society in which many different cultures will live together in perfect equality and peace (i.e., a society that has never existed and never will exist); the real meaning of these slogans is that the power of the existing mainstream society to determine its own destiny shall be drastically reduced while the power of other groups, formerly marginal or external to that society, will be increased. In other words the U.S. must, in the name of diversity, abandon its particularity while the very groups making that demand shall hold on to theirs.\n\nAuster also wrote:\n\nIn demanding that non-European cultures, as cultures, be given the same importance as the European-American national culture, the multiculturalists are declaring that the non-European groups are unable or unwilling to assimilate as European immigrants have in the past, and that for the sake of these non-assimilating groups American society must be radically transformed. This ethnically and racially based rejection of the common American culture should lead thoughtful Americans to re-evaluate some contemporary assumptions about ethnicity and assimilation.\n\nAnother critic of multiculturalism is the political theorist Brian Barry. In his 2002 book \"Culture and Equality: An Egalitarian Critique of Multiculturalism\", he argues that some forms of multiculturalism can divide people, although they need to unite in order to fight for social justice.\n\nByron M. Roth, Professor Emeritus of Psychology at Dowling College, has argued that multiculturalism is \"profoundly undemocratic\" and that multicultural countries can only be held together through state coercion. In his book \"The Perils of Diversity: Immigration and Human Nature\", Roth writes:\n\nFrom the perspective of inclusive fitness, unfamiliar others are potential free-riders and, out of a concern that they will be exploited by others, people reduce considerably their altruistic attitudes and behavior in a general way in more diverse communities. This loss of trust is a symptom of a breakdown in social cohesion and is surely a forerunner of the sort of ethnic conflict that is always likely to break out if allowed to do so. This is undoubtedly the reason why multicultural nation-states are forever promoting tolerance and ever more punitive sanctions for the expression of ethnic hostility, even going so far to as to discourage the expression of opinion about the reality of ethnic and racial differences. Currently these measures are directed at the host population when they express reservations about the wisdom of mass immigration, but this will surely change as it becomes ever more obvious that it is the presence of competing ethnic groups that is creating the tension and not the expressed reservations of the majority population. The real danger for modern democracies is that in their zeal to promote multicultural societies, they will be forced to resort to the means that have characterized all empires attempting to maintain their hegemony over disparate peoples.\n\nAccording to Roth, multiculturalism\n\n... denies historical and scientific evidence that people differ in important biological and cultural ways that makes their assimilation into host countries problematic. It is also extreme in the viciousness with which it attacks those who differ on this issue. These attacks are accompanied by a very generalized and one-sided denigration of Western traditions and Western accomplishments, and claims that a collective guilt should be assumed by all Europeans (whites) for the sins of their forebears... In the semireligious formulation of this view, expiation of these sins can only come through an absolute benevolence toward the poor of the world whose suffering is claimed to be the result of the white race and its depredations. In practical terms this can only be accomplished through aid to Third World peoples and generous immigration policies that allow large numbers of people to escape the poverty of the Third World.\n\nKevin B. MacDonald, a professor of psychology at California State University, Long Beach, has argued in his trilogy of books on Judaism that Jews have been prominent as main ideologues and promoters of multiculturalism in an attempt to end anti-semitism. MacDonald considers multiculturalism to be dangerous to the West, concluding in his Jack London Literary Prize acceptance speech:\n[Given] that some ethnic groups—especially ones with high levels of ethnocentrism and mobilization—will undoubtedly continue to function as groups far into the foreseeable future, unilateral renunciation of ethnic loyalties by some groups means only their surrender and defeat—the Darwinian dead end of extinction. The future, then, like the past, will inevitably be a Darwinian competition in which ethnicity plays a very large role.\n\nThe alternative faced by Europeans throughout the Western world is to place themselves in a position of enormous vulnerability in which their destinies will be determined by other peoples, many of whom hold deep historically conditioned hatreds toward them. Europeans' promotion of their own displacement is the ultimate foolishness—an historical mistake of catastrophic proportions.\nFinally, multiculturalism and cultural relativism have been fiercely attacked by American social thinker Lloyd deMause, founder of psychohistory. DeMause's central argument is that, in the past, the astronomical infanticidal ratios among the tribes gives the lie to the claim that the diverse cultures are basically equal. DeMause wrote: \"The best estimate I could make from the statistics was that in antiquity about half of all children born were killed by their caretakers, declining to about a third by later medieval times and to a very small percentage by the seventeenth century in Western Europe and America.\"\n\nHarvard professor of political science Robert D. Putnam conducted a nearly decade long study on how diversity affects social trust. He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that when the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust. People in diverse communities \"don't trust the local mayor, they don't trust the local paper, they don't trust other people and they don't trust institutions,\" writes Putnam. In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that\n[W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it's not just that we don't trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don't trust people who do look like us.\nEthologist Frank Salter writes:\nRelatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism. For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government's share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens. Case studies of the United States ... find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure. ... A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogeneous cities.\n\nBefore World War II, major tensions arose from the last, monarchist Yugoslavia's multi-ethnic makeup and absolute political and demographic domination of the Serbs. The Yugoslav wars that took place between 1991 and 2001 were characterized by bitter ethnic conflicts between the peoples of the former Yugoslavia, mostly between Serbs on the one side and Croats, Bosniaks or Albanians on the other; but also between Bosniaks and Croats in Bosnia and Macedonians and Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nThe conflict had its roots in various underlying political, economic and cultural problems, which provided justifications for political and religious leaders, and manifested itself through often provoked and artificial created ethnic and religious tensions.\n\nIn an article in the \"Hudson Review\", Bruce Bawer writes about what he sees as a developing distaste toward the idea and policies of multiculturalism in Europe, especially, as stated earlier, in the Netherlands, Denmark, United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Austria and Germany. The belief behind this backlash on multiculturalism is that it creates friction within society.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "216410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216410", "title": "Daisyworld", "text": "Daisyworld\n\nDaisyworld, a computer simulation, is a hypothetical world orbiting a star whose radiant energy is slowly increasing or decreasing. It is meant to mimic important elements of the Earth-Sun system, and was introduced by James Lovelock and Andrew Watson in a paper published in 1983 to illustrate the plausibility of the Gaia hypothesis. In the original 1983 version, Daisyworld is seeded with two varieties of daisy as its only life forms: black daisies and white daisies. White petaled daisies reflect light, while black petaled daisies absorb light. The simulation tracks the two daisy populations and the surface temperature of Daisyworld as the sun's rays grow more powerful. The surface temperature of Daisyworld remains almost constant over a broad range of solar output.\n\nThe purpose of the model is to demonstrate that feedback mechanisms can evolve from the actions or activities of self-interested organisms, rather than through classic group selection mechanisms. Daisyworld examines the energy budget of a planet populated by two different types of plants, black daisies and white daisies. The colour of the daisies influences the albedo of the planet such that black daisies absorb light and warm the planet, while white daisies reflect light and cool the planet. Competition between the daisies (based on temperature-effects on growth rates) leads to a balance of populations that tends to favour a planetary temperature close to the optimum for daisy growth.\n\nLovelock and Watson demonstrated the stability of Daisyworld by making its sun evolve along the main sequence, taking it from low to high solar constant. This perturbation of Daisyworld's receipt of solar radiation caused the balance of daisies to gradually shift from black to white but the planetary temperature was always regulated back to this optimum (except at the extreme ends of solar evolution). This situation is very different from the corresponding abiotic world, where temperature is unregulated and rises linearly with solar output.\n\nLater versions of Daisyworld introduced a range of grey daisies, as well as populations of grazers and predators, and found that these further increased the stability of the homeostasis. More recently, other research, modeling the real biochemical cycles of Earth, and using various types of organisms (e.g. photosynthesisers, decomposers, herbivores and primary and secondary carnivores) has also been shown to produce Daisyworld-like regulation and stability, which helps to explain planetary biological diversity.\n\nThis enables nutrient recycling within a regulatory framework derived by natural selection amongst species, where one being's harmful waste becomes low energy food for members of another guild. This research on the Redfield ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus shows that local biotic processes can regulate global systems (See Keith Downing & Peter Zvirinsky, \"The Simulated Evolution of Biochemical Guilds: Reconciling Gaia Theory with Natural Selection\").\n\nAt the beginning of the simulation, the sun's rays are weak and Daisyworld is too cold to support any life. Its surface is barren, and gray. As the luminosity of the sun's rays increases, germination of black daisies becomes possible. Because black daisies absorb more of the sun's radiant energy, they are able to increase their individual temperatures to healthy levels on the still cool surface of Daisyworld. As a result, they thrive and the population soon grows large enough to increase the average surface temperature of Daisyworld.\n\nAs the surface heats up, it becomes more habitable for white daisies, whose competing population grows to rival the black daisy population. As the two populations reach equilibrium, so too does the surface temperature of Daisyworld, which settles on a value most comfortable for both populations.\n\nIn this first phase of the simulation we see that black daisies have warmed Daisyworld so that it is habitable over a wider range of solar luminosity than would have been possible on a barren, gray planet. This allowed growth of the white daisy population, and the two populations of daisies are now working together to regulate the surface temperature.\n\nThe second phase of the simulation documents what happens as the sun's luminosity continues to increase, heating the surface of Daisyworld beyond a comfortable range for the daisies. This temperature increase causes white daisies, who are better able to stay cool because of their high albedo or ability to reflect sunlight, to gain a selective advantage over the black daisies. White daisies begin replacing black daisies, which has a cooling effect on Daisyworld. The result is that Daisyworld's surface temperature remains habitable - in fact almost constant - even as the luminosity of the sun continues to increase.\n\nIn the third phase of the simulation, the sun's rays have grown so powerful that soon even the white daisies can no longer survive. At a certain luminosity their population crashes, and the barren, gray surface of Daisyworld, no longer able to reflect the sun's rays, rapidly heats up.\n\nAt this point in the simulation solar luminosity is programmed to decline, retracing its original path to its initial value. Even as it declines to levels that previously supported vast populations of daisies in the third phase, no daisies are able to grow because the surface of barren, gray Daisyworld is still far too hot. Eventually, the sun's rays decrease in power to a more comfortable level which allows white daisies to grow, who begin cooling the planet.\n\nBecause Daisyworld is so simplistic, having for example, no atmosphere, no animals, only one species of plant life, and only the most basic population growth and death models, it should not be directly compared to Earth. This was stated very clearly by the original authors. Even so, it provided a number of useful predictions of how Earth's biosphere may respond to, for example, human interference. Later adaptations of Daisyworld (discussed below), which added many layers of complexity, still showed the same basic trends of the original model.\n\nOne prediction of the simulation is that the biosphere works to regulate the climate, making it habitable over a wide range of solar luminosity. Many examples of these regulatory systems have been found on Earth.\n\nDaisyworld was designed to refute the idea that there was something inherently mystical about the Gaia hypothesis that Earth's surface displays homeostatic and homeorhetic properties similar to those of a living organism. Specifically, thermoregulation was addressed. The Gaia hypothesis had attracted a substantial amount of criticism from scientists such as Richard Dawkins, who argued that planet-level thermoregulation was impossible without planetary natural selection, which might involve evidence of dead planets that did not thermoregulate. Dr. W. Ford Doolittle rejected the notion of planetary regulation because it seemed to require a \"secret consensus\" among organisms, thus some sort of inexplicable purpose on a planetary scale. Incidentally, neither of these neoDarwinians made a close examination of the wide-ranging evidence presented in Lovelock's books that was suggestive of planetary regulation, dismissing the theory based on what they saw as its incompatibility with the latest views on the processes by which evolution works. Lovelock's model countered the criticism that some \"secret consensus\" would be required for planetary regulation by showing how in this model thermoregulation of the planet, beneficial to the two species, arises naturally.\n\nLater criticism of Daisyworld itself centers around the fact that although it is often used as an analogy for Earth, the original simulations leaves out many important details of the true Earth system. For example, the system requires an ad-hoc death rate (γ) to sustain homeostasis, and it does not take into account the difference between species-level phenomena and individual level phenomena. Detractors of the simulation believed inclusion of these details would cause it to become unstable, and therefore, false. Many of these issues are addressed in a more recent paper by Timothy Lenton and James Lovelock in 2001. In this paper it is shown that inclusion of these factors actually improves Daisyworld's ability to regulate its climate.\n\nThe importance of the large number of species in an ecosystem, led to two sets of views about the role played by biodiversity in the stability of ecosystems in Gaia theory. In one school of thought labelled the \"species redundancy\" hypothesis, proposed by Australian ecologist Brian Walker, most species are seen as having little contribution overall in the stability, comparable to the passengers in an aeroplane who play little role in its successful flight. The hypothesis leads to the conclusion that only a few key species are necessary for a healthy ecosystem. The \"rivet-popper\" hypothesis put forth by Paul R. Ehrlich and his wife Anne H. Ehrlich, compares each species forming part of an ecosystem as a rivet on the aeroplane (represented by the ecosystem). The progressive loss of species mirrors the progressive loss of rivets from the plane, weakening it till it is no longer sustainable and crashes.\n\nLater extensions of the Daisyworld simulation which included rabbits, foxes and other species, led to a surprising finding that the larger the number of species, the greater the improving effects on the entire planet (i.e., the temperature regulation was improved). It also showed that the system was robust and stable even when perturbed. Daisyworld simulations where environmental changes were stable gradually became less diverse over time; in contrast gentle perturbations led to bursts of species richness. These findings lent support to the idea that biodiversity is valuable.\n\nThis finding was supported by an eleven-year-old study of the factors species composition, dynamics and diversity in successional and native grasslands in Minnesota by David Tilman and John A. Downing wherein they discovered that \"primary productivity in more diverse plant communities is more resistant to, and recovers more fully from, a major drought\". They go on to add \"Our results support the diversity stability hypothesis but not the alternative hypothesis that most species are functionally redundant\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19075848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19075848", "title": "Death (personification)", "text": "Death (personification)\n\nDeath, due to its prominent place in human culture, is frequently imagined as a personified force, also known as the Grim Reaper. In some mythologies, the Grim Reaper causes the victim's death by coming to collect them. In turn, people in some stories try to hold on to life by avoiding Death's visit, or by fending Death off with bribery or tricks. Other beliefs hold that the Spectre of Death is only a psychopomp, serving to sever the last ties between the soul and the body, and to guide the deceased to the afterlife, without having any control over when or how the victim dies. Death is most often personified in male form, although in certain cultures Death is perceived as female (for instance, Marzanna in Slavic mythology, or La Catrina in Mexico).\n\nMot ( \"Death\") was personified to Canaanites as a god of death. He was considered a son of the king of the gods, El. His contest with the storm god Baʿal forms part of the myth cycle discovered in the 1920s in the ruins of Ugarit. Lacunae obscure some of the details, but Mot apparently consumes Baʿal before being split open and mutilated by that god's sister, the warrior 'Anat. After a time, both gods are restored and resume battle before the sun goddess Shapash prompts a truce by warning Mot that, if forced to, El would intervene on Baʿal's behalf. The Phoenicians also worshipped death under the name Mot and a version of Mot later became Maweth, the devil or angel of death in Judaism.\n\nIn Ancient Greek religion and Greek mythology, death (Thanatos) is one of the children of Nyx (night). Like her, he is seldom portrayed directly. He sometimes appears in art as a bearded and winged man, less often as a winged and beardless youth. He has a twin, Hypnos, the god of sleep. Together, Thanatos and Hypnos generally represent a gentle death. Thanatos, led by Hermes \"psychopompos\", takes the shade of the deceased to the near shore of the river Styx, whence the boatman Charon, on payment of a small fee, conveys the shade to Hades, the realm of the dead. Homer's \"Iliad\" 16.681, and the Euphronios Krater's depiction of the same episode, have Apollo instruct the removal of the heroic, semi-divine Sarpedon's body from the battlefield by Hypnos and Thanatos, and conveyed thence to his homeland for proper funeral rites. Among the other children of Nyx are Thanatos' sisters, the Keres, blood-drinking, vengeant spirits of violent or untimely death, portrayed as fanged and taloned, with bloody garments.\n\nBreton folklore shows a spectral figure portending death, the Ankou (\"yr Angau\" in Welsh). Usually, the Ankou is the spirit of the last person that died within the community and appears as a tall, haggard figure with a wide hat and long white hair or a skeleton with a revolving head who sees everyone, everywhere. The Ankou drives a deathly wagon or cart with a creaking axle. The cart or wagon is piled high with corpses and a stop at a cabin means instant death for those inside.\n\nIn Ireland there was a creature known as a dullahan, whose head would be tucked under his or her arm (dullahans were not one, but an entire species), and the head was said to have large eyes and a smile that could reach the head's ears. The dullahan would ride a black horse or a carriage pulled by black horses, and stop at the house of someone about to die, and call their name, and immediately the person would die. The dullahan did not like being watched, and it was believed that if a dullahan knew someone was watching them, they would lash that person's eyes with their whip, which was made from a spine; or they would toss a basin of blood on the person, which was a sign that the person was next to die.\n\nAlso in Ireland there is a female spirit known as Banshee (Gaelic: \"ban sibh\" pron. banshee, \"white spirit/fairy\"), who heralds the death of a person, usually by shrieking or keening. The banshee is often described in Gaelic lore as wearing red or green, usually with long, disheveled hair. She can appear in a variety of forms. Perhaps most often she is seen as an ugly, frightful hag, but she can also appear as young and beautiful if she chooses. In Ireland and parts of Scotland, a traditional part of mourning is the keening woman (bean chaointe), who wails a lament – in Irish: Caoineadh, caoin meaning \"to weep, to wail\". When several banshees appear at once, it indicates the death of someone great or holy. The tales sometimes recounted that the woman, though called a fairy, was a ghost, often of a specific murdered woman, or a mother who died in childbirth.\n\nIn Scottish folklore there was a belief that a black, dark green or white dog known as a Cù Sìth took dying souls to the afterlife.\n\nIn Welsh Folklore Gwyn ap Nudd is the escort of the grave, the personification of Death and Winter who leads the wild hunt to collect wayward souls and escort them to the Otherworld, sometimes it is Melwas, Arawn or Afallach in a similar position.\n\nLa Calavera Catrina is a character in Mexican culture and art that symbolizes death. She is an icon of the Mexican Day of the Dead, a holiday that focuses on the remembrance of the dead.\n\nOur Lady of the Holy Death (Santa Muerte) is a female deity or folk saint of Mexican folk religion, whose faith has been spreading in Mexico and the United States. In Spanish the word \"muerte\" (death in English) is a female noun, so it is common in Spanish-speaking countries for death to be personified as female figures. This also happens in other Romanic languages like French (\"la mort\"), Portuguese (\"a morte\") and Italian (\"la morte\"). Since the pre-Columbian era Mexican culture has maintained a certain reverence towards death, which can be seen in the widespread commemoration of the Day of the Dead. Elements of that celebration include the use of skeletons to remind people of their mortality. The cult of Santa Muerte is indeed a continuation of the Aztec cult of the goddess of death Mictecacihuatl (Nahuatl for \"Lady of the Dead\") clad in Spanish iconography.\n\nIn Aztec mythology, Mictecacihuatl is the \"Queen of Mictlan\" (Mictlancihuatl), the underworld, ruling over the afterlife with Mictlantecuhtli, another deity who is designated as her husband. Her role is to keep watch over the bones of the dead. She presided over the ancient festivals of the dead, which evolved from Aztec traditions into the modern Day of the Dead after synthesis with Spanish cultural traditions. She is said now to preside over the contemporary festival as well. She is known as the \"Lady of the Dead\" since it is believed that she was born, then sacrificed as an infant. Mictecacihuatl was represented with a defleshed body and with jaw agape to swallow the stars during the day.\n\nSan La Muerte (Saint Death) is a skeletal folk saint that is venerated in Paraguay, the Northeast of Argentina and southern Brazil. As the result of internal migration in Argentina since the 1960s the veneration of San La Muerte has been extended to Greater Buenos Aires and the national prison system as well. Saint Death is depicted as a male skeleton figure usually holding a scythe. Although the Catholic Church in Mexico has attacked the devotion of Saint Death as a tradition that mixes paganism with Christianity and is contrary to the Christian belief of Christ defeating death, many devotees consider the veneration of San La Muerte as being part of their Catholic faith. The rituals connected to and powers ascribed to San La Muerte are very similar to those of Santa Muerte.\n\nIn Guatemala, San Pascualito is a skeletal folk saint venerated as \"King of the Graveyard\". He is depicted as a skeletal figure with a scythe, sometimes wearing a cape and crown. He is associated with death and the curing of diseases.\n\nIn the Brazilian religion Umbanda, the orixá Omolu personifies sickness and death, and also the cure. The image of the death is also associated with Exu, lord of the crossroads, who rules the midnight and the cemeteries.\n\nIn Haitian Vodou, the Guédé are a family of spirits that embody death and fertility.\n\nIn Poland, Death, or \"Śmierć\", has an appearance similar to the traditional Grim Reaper, but instead of a black robe, Death has a white robe. Also, due to grammar, Death is a female (the word \"śmierć\" is of feminine gender), mostly seen as an old skeletal woman, as depicted in 15th-century dialogue \"Rozmowa Mistrza Polikarpa ze Śmiercią\" (Latin: \"Dialogus inter Mortem et Magistrum Polikarpum\").\n\nIn Serbia and other Slavic countries, Grim Reaper is well known as \"Smrt\" (\"Death\") or \"Kosač\" (\"Billhook\"), Slavic people found this very similar to the Devil and other dark powers. One popular saying about the Grim Reaper is: \"Smrt ne bira ni vreme, ni mesto, ni godinu\" (\"Death is not choosing a time, place or years\" - which means she is destiny.)\n\nIn the Netherlands, but also to lesser extent in Belgium, the personification of Death is known as \"Magere Hein\" (\"Meager Hein\"). Historically, he was sometimes simply referred to as \"Hein\" or variations thereof such as \"Heintje\", \"Heintjeman\" and \"Oom Hendrik\" (\"Uncle Hendrik\"). Related archaic terms are \"Beenderman\" (\"Bone-man\"), \"Scherminkel\" (very meager person, \"skeleton\") and \"Maaijeman\" (\"mow-man\", a reference to his scythe).\n\nThe concept of \"Magere Hein\" was pre-Christian and tied to Pagan beliefs, but it was Christianized and likely gained its modern name and features (scythe, skeleton, black robe etc.) during the Middle Ages. The designation \"Meager\" comes from its portrayal as a skeleton, which was largely influenced by the Christian \"Dance of Death\" (Dutch: \"dodendans\") theme that was prominent in Europe during the late Middle Ages. \"Hein\" was a Middle Dutch name originating as a short form of \"Heinric\" (see Henry (given name)). Its use was possibly related to the comparable German concept of \"Freund Hein\". Notable is that many of the names given to Death can also refer to the Devil, showing how his status as a feared and \"evil\" being led to him being merged into the concept of Satan.\n\nIn Belgium, this personification of Death is now commonly called \"Pietje de Dood\" \"Little Pete, the Death\". As with some of the Dutch names, it can also refer to the Devil.\n\nIn Scandinavia, in Norse mythology death was personified in the shape of Hel, the goddess of death and ruler over the realm of the same name, where she received a portion of the dead. In the times of the Black Plague, Death would often be depicted as an old woman known by the name of Pesta, meaning \"plague hag\". She wore a black hood. She would go into a town carrying either a rake or a broom. If she brought the rake, some people would survive the plague; if she brought the broom, however, everyone would die.\n\nLater, Scandinavians adopted the classic Grim Reaper with a scythe and black robe.\n\nLithuanians named Death \"Giltinė\", deriving from the word \"gelti\" (\"to sting\"). Giltinė was viewed as an old, ugly woman with a long blue nose and a deadly poisonous tongue. The legend tells that Giltinė was young, pretty and communicative until she was trapped in a coffin for seven years. The goddess of death was a sister of the goddess of life and destiny, Laima, symbolizing the relationship between beginning and end.\n\nLithuanians later adopted the classic Grim Reaper with a scythe and black robe.\n\nThe Sanskrit word for death is \"mrityu\" (cognate with Latin \"mors\" and Polish \"śmierć\"), which is often personified in Dharmic religions.\n\nIn Hindu scriptures, the lord of death is called King Yama (, \"Yama Rājā\"). He is also known as the King of Karmic Justice (\"Dharmaraja\") as one's karma at death was considered to lead to a just rebirth. (Yudhishthira, eldest of the pandavas and a personification of justice, was born through Kunti's prayers to Yama.) Yama rides a black buffalo and carries a rope lasso to carry the soul back to his home, called Naraka, pathalloka, or Yamaloka. There are many forms of reapers, although some say there is only one who disguises himself as a small child. His agents, the Yamadutas, carry souls back to Yamalok. There, all the accounts of a person's good and bad deeds are stored and maintained by Chitragupta. The balance of these deeds allows Yama to decide where the soul has to reside in its next life, following the theory of reincarnation. Yama is also mentioned in the Mahabharata as a great philosopher and devotee of the Supreme Brahman.\n\nBuddhist scriptures also mention Mara, much in the similar way.\n\nYama was introduced to Chinese mythology through Buddhism. In Chinese, he is known as King Yan ( ,  ,  \"Yánwáng\") or Yanluo ( ,  ,  \"Yánluówáng\"), ruling the ten gods of the underworld Diyu. He is normally depicted wearing a Chinese judge's cap and traditional Chinese robes and appears on most forms of hell money offered in ancestor worship. From China, Yama spread to Japan as the Great King Enma (, \"Enma-Dai-Ō\"), ruler of Jigoku (); Korea as the Great King Yŏmna (), ruler of Jiok (); and Vietnam as ', ruler of ' or \"\"\n\nSeparately, the \"Kojiki\" relates that the Japanese goddess Izanami was burnt to death giving birth to the fire god Hinokagutsuchi. She then entered a realm of perpetual night called Yomi-no-Kuni. Her husband Izanagi pursued her there but discovered his wife was no longer as beautiful as before. After an argument, she promises she will take a thousand lives every day, becoming a goddess of death. There are also death gods called shinigami (死神), which are closer to the Western tradition of the Grim Reaper; while common in modern Japanese arts and fiction, they were essentially absent in traditional mythology.\n\nIn Korean mythology, the equivalent of the Grim Reaper is the \"Netherworld Emissary\" Jeoseung-saja (). He is depicted as a stern and ruthless bureaucrat in Yŏmna's service. A psychopomp, he escorts all—good or evil—from the land of the living to the netherworld when the time comes.\n\nThe \"Angel of the Lord\" smites 185,000 men in the Assyrian camp (II Kings 19:35). When the Angel of Death passes through to smite the Egyptian first-born, God prevents \"the destroyer\" (\"shâchath\") from entering houses with blood on the lintel and side posts (Exodus 12:23). The \"destroying angel\" (\"mal'ak ha-mashḥit\") rages among the people in Jerusalem (II Sam. 24:16). In I Chronicles 21:15 the \"angel of the Lord\" is seen by King David standing \"between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem.\" The biblical Book of Job (33:22) uses the general term \"destroyers\" (\"memitim\"), which tradition has identified with \"destroying angels\" (\"mal'ake Khabbalah\"), and Prov. 16:14 uses the term the \"angels of death\" (\"mal'ake ha-mavet\"). The angel Azra'il is sometimes referred as the Angel of Death as well.\n\nJewish tradition also refers to Death as the Angel of Dark and Light, a name which stems from Talmudic lore. There is also a reference to \"Abaddon\" (The Destroyer), an Angel who is known as the \"Angel of the Abyss\". In Talmudic lore, he is characterized as archangel Michael.\n\nIn Hebrew scriptures, Death (\"\"Maweth\"/\"Mavet(h)\"\") is sometimes personified as a devil or angel of death (e.g., ; ). In both the Book of Hosea and the Book of Jeremiah, Maweth/Mot is mentioned as a deity to whom Yahweh can turn over Judah as punishment for worshiping other gods. The memitim are a type of angel from biblical lore associated with the mediation over the lives of the dying. The name is derived from the Hebrew word \"mĕmītǐm\" (מְמִיתִים – \"executioners\", \"slayers\", \"destroyers\") and refers to angels that brought about the destruction of those whom the guardian angels no longer protected. While there may be some debate among religious scholars regarding the exact nature of the memitim, it is generally accepted that, as described in the Book of Job 33:22, they are killers of some sort.\n\nAccording to the Midrash, the Angel of Death was created by God on the first day. His dwelling is in heaven, whence he reaches earth in eight flights, whereas Pestilence reaches it in one. He has twelve wings. \"Over all people have I surrendered thee the power,\" said God to the Angel of Death, \"only not over this one [i.e. Moses] which has received freedom from death through the Law.\" It is said of the Angel of Death that he is full of eyes. In the hour of death, he stands at the head of the departing one with a drawn sword, to which clings a drop of gall. As soon as the dying man sees Death, he is seized with a convulsion and opens his mouth, whereupon Death throws the drop into it. This drop causes his death; he turns putrid, and his face becomes yellow. The expression \"the taste of death\" originated in the idea that death was caused by a drop of gall.\n\nThe soul escapes through the mouth, or, as is stated in another place, through the throat; therefore, the Angel of Death stands at the head of the patient (Adolf Jellinek, l.c. ii. 94, Midr. Teh. to Ps. xi.). When the soul forsakes the body, its voice goes from one end of the world to the other, but is not heard (Gen. R. vi. 7; Ex. R. v. 9; Pirḳe R. El. xxxiv.). The drawn sword of the Angel of Death, mentioned by the Chronicler (I. Chron. 21:15; comp. Job 15:22; Enoch 62:11), indicates that the Angel of Death was figured as a warrior who kills off the children of men. \"Man, on the day of his death, falls down before the Angel of Death like a beast before the slaughterer\" (Grünhut, \"Liḳḳuṭim\", v. 102a). R. Samuel's father (c. 200) said: \"The Angel of Death said to me, 'Only for the sake of the honor of mankind do I not tear off their necks as is done to slaughtered beasts'\" ('Ab. Zarah 20b). In later representations, the knife sometimes replaces the sword, and reference is also made to the cord of the Angel of Death, which indicates death by throttling. Moses says to God: \"I fear the cord of the Angel of Death\" (Grünhut, l.c. v. 103a et seq.). Of the four Jewish methods of execution, three are named in connection with the Angel of Death: Burning (by pouring hot lead down the victim's throat), slaughtering (by beheading), and throttling. The Angel of Death administers the particular punishment that God has ordained for the commission of sin.\n\nA peculiar mantle (\"idra\"-according to Levy, \"Neuhebr. Wörterb.\" i. 32, a sword) belongs to the equipment of the Angel of Death (Eccl. R. iv. 7). The Angel of Death takes on the particular form which will best serve his purpose; e.g., he appears to a scholar in the form of a beggar imploring pity (The beggar should receive Tzedakah.)(M. Ḳ. 28a). \"When pestilence rages in the town, walk not in the middle of the street, because the Angel of Death [i.e., pestilence] strides there; if peace reigns in the town, walk not on the edges of the road. When pestilence rages in the town, go not alone to the synagogue, because there the Angel of Death stores his tools. If the dogs howl, the Angel of Death has entered the city; if they make sport, the prophet Elijah has come\" (B. Ḳ. 60b). The \"destroyer\" (\"saṭan ha-mashḥit\") in the daily prayer is the Angel of Death (Ber. 16b). Midr. Ma'ase Torah (compare Jellinek, \"B. H.\" ii. 98) says: \"There are six Angels of Death: Gabriel over kings; Ḳapẓiel over youths; Mashbir over animals; Mashḥit over children; Af and Ḥemah over man and beast.\"\n\nTalmud teachers of the 4th century associate quite familiarly with him. When he appeared to one on the street, the teacher reproached him with rushing upon him as upon a beast, whereupon the angel called upon him at his house. To another, he granted a respite of thirty days, that he might put his knowledge in order before entering the next world. To a third, he had no access, because he could not interrupt the study of the Talmud. To a fourth, he showed a rod of fire, whereby he is recognized as the Angel of Death (M. K. 28a). He often entered the house of Bibi and conversed with him (Ḥag. 4b). Often, he resorts to strategy in order to interrupt and seize his victim (B. M. 86a; Mak. 10a).\n\nThe death of Joshua ben Levi in particular is surrounded with a web of fable. When the time came for him to die and the Angel of Death appeared to him, he demanded to be shown his place in paradise. When the angel had consented to this, he demanded the angel's knife, that the angel might not frighten him by the way. This request also was granted him, and Joshua sprang with the knife over the wall of paradise; the angel, who is not allowed to enter paradise, caught hold of the end of his garment. Joshua swore that he would not come out, and God declared that he should not leave paradise unless he was absolved from his oath; if not absolved, he was to remain. The Angel of Death then demanded back his knife, but Joshua refused. At this point, a heavenly voice (\"bat ḳol\") rang out: \"Give him back the knife, because the children of men have need of it will bring death.\" Hesitant, Joshua Ben Levi gives back the knife in exchange for the Angel of Deaths name. To never forget the name he carved Troke into his arm the Angel of Death's chosen name. When the knife was returned to the Angel Joshua's carving of the name faded and he forgot.\n(Ket. 77b; Jellinek, l.c. ii. 48–51; Bacher, l.c. i. 192 et seq.).\n\nThe Rabbis found the Angel of Death mentioned in Psalm 89:48, where the Targum translates: \"There is no man who lives and, seeing the Angel of Death, can deliver his soul from his hand.\" Eccl. 8:4 is thus explained in Midrash Rabbah to the passage: \"One may not escape the Angel of Death, nor say to him, 'Wait until I put my affairs in order,' or 'There is my son, my slave: take him in my stead.'\" Where the Angel of Death appears, there is no remedy, but his name (Talmud, Ned. 49a; Hul. 7b). If one who has sinned has confessed his fault, the Angel of Death may not touch him (Midrash Tanhuma, ed. Buber, 139). God protects from the Angel of Death (Midrash Genesis Rabbah lxviii.).\n\nBy acts of benevolence, the anger of the Angel of Death is overcome; when one fails to perform such acts the Angel of Death will make his appearance (Derek Ereẓ Zuṭa, viii.). The Angel of Death receives his orders from God (Ber. 62b). As soon as he has received permission to destroy, however, he makes no distinction between good and bad (B. Ḳ. 60a). In the city of Luz, the Angel of Death has no power, and, when the aged inhabitants are ready to die, they go outside the city (Soṭah 46b; compare Sanh. 97a). A legend to the same effect existed in Ireland in the Middle Ages (\"Jew. Quart. Rev.\" vi. 336).\n\nDeath is also one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse portrayed in the Book of Revelation. Revelation 6:7–8\n\nIn Islam, Archangel Azrail is the \"Malak al-Maut\" (angel of death). He and his many subordinates pull the souls out of the bodies, and guide them through the journey of the afterlife. Their appearance depends on the person's deed and actions, with those that did good seeing a beautiful being, and those that did wrong seeing a horrific monster.\n\nIslamic tradition discusses elaborately, almost in graphic detail, as to what exactly happens before, during, and after the death. The angel of death appears to the dying to take out their souls. The sinners' souls are extracted in a most painful way while the righteous are treated easily. After the burial, two angels – Munkar and Nakir – come to question the dead in order to test their faith. The righteous believers answer correctly and live in peace and comfort while the sinners and disbelievers fail and punishments ensue. The time period or stage between death and resurrection is called \"barzakh\" (the interregnum).\n\nDeath is a significant event in Islamic life and theology. It is seen not as the termination of life, rather the continuation of life in another form. In Islamic belief, God has made this worldly life as a test and a preparation ground for the afterlife; and with death, this worldly life comes to an end. Thus, every person has only one chance to prepare themselves for the life to come where God will resurrect and judge every individual and will entitle them to rewards or punishment, based on their good or bad deeds. And death is seen as the gateway to and beginning of the afterlife. In Islamic belief, death is predetermined by God, and the exact time of a person's death is known only to God.\n\n\n\n"}

The global pattern of behaviour is an emergent property of dynamical mechanisms that act upon local components, such as indirect communication, rather than the result of a central ordering influence (see centralised system).\n\nA centralised system is one in which a central controller exercises control over the lower-level components of the system directly or through the use of a power hierarchy (such as instructing a middle level component to instruct a lower level component). The complex behaviour exhibited by this system is thus the result of the central controller's \"control\" over lower level components in the system, including the active supervision of the lower level components.\n\nA decentralised system, on the other hand, is one in which complex behaviour emerges through the work of lower level components operating on local information, not the instructions of any commanding influence. This form of control is known as distributed control, or control in which each component of the system is equally responsible for contributing to the global, complex behaviour by acting on local information in the appropriate manner. The lower level components are implicitly aware of these appropriate responses through mechanisms that are based on the component's interaction with the environment, including other components in that environment.\n\nDecentralised systems are intricately linked to the idea of self-organisation—a phenomenon in which local interactions between components of a system establish order and coordination to achieve global goals without a central commanding influence. The rules specifying these interactions emerge from local information and in the case of biological (or biologically-inspired) agents, from the closely linked perception and action system of the agents. These interactions continually form and depend on spatio-temporal patterns, which are created through the positive and negative feedback that the interactions provide. For example, recruitment in the foraging behaviour of ants relies on the positive feedback of the ant finding food at the end of a pheromone trail while ants' task-switching behaviour relies on the negative feedback of making antennal contact with a certain number of ants (for example, a sufficiently low encounter rate with successful foragers can cause a midden worker to switch to foraging, although other factors like food availability can affect the threshold for switching).\n\nWhile decentralised systems can easily be found in nature, they are also evident in aspects of human society such as governmental and economic systems.\n\nOne of the most well known examples of a \"natural\" decentralized system is one used by certain insect colonies. In these insect colonies, control is distributed among the homogeneous biological agents who act upon local information and local interactions to collectively create complex, global behaviour. While individually exhibiting simple behaviours, these agents achieve global goals such as feeding the colony or raising the brood by using dynamical mechanisms like non-explicit communication and exploiting their closely coupled action and perception systems. Without any form of central control, these insect colonies achieve global goals by performing required tasks, responding to changing conditions in the colony environment in terms of task-activity, and subsequently adjusting the number of workers performing each task to ensure that all tasks are completed. For example, ant colonies guide their global behaviour (in terms of foraging, patrolling, brood care, and nest maintenance) using a pulsing, shifting web of spatio-temporal patterned interactions that rely on antennal contact rate and olfactory sensing. While these interactions consist of both interactions with the environment and each other, ants do not direct the behaviour of other ants and thus never have a \"central controller\" dictating what is to be done to achieve global goals.\n\nInstead, ants use a flexible task-allocation system that allows the colony to respond rapidly to changing needs for achieving these goals. This task-allocation system, similar to a division of labor is flexible in that all tasks rely on either the number of ant encounters (which take the form of antennal contact) and the sensing of chemical gradients (using olfactory sensing for pheromone trails) and can thus be applied to the entire ant population. While recent research has shown that certain tasks may have physiologically and age-based response thresholds, all tasks can be completed by \"any\" ant in the colony.\n\nFor example, in foraging behaviour, red harvester ants (\"Pogonomyrmex barbatus\") communicate to other ants where food is, how much food there is, and whether or not they should switch tasks to forage based on cuticular hydrocarbon scents and the rate of ant-interaction. By using the combined odors of forager cuticular hydrocarbons and of seeds and interaction rate using brief antennal contact, the colony captures precise information about the current availability of food and thus whether or not they should switch to foraging behaviour \"all without being directed by a central controller or even another ant\". The rate at which foragers return with seeds sets the rate at which outgoing foragers leave the nest on foraging trips; faster rates of return indicate more food availability and fewer interactions indicate a greater need for foragers. A combination of these two factors, which are solely based on local information from the environment, leads to decisions about switching to the foraging task and ultimately, to achieving the global goal of feeding the colony.\n\nIn short, the use of a combination of simple cues makes it possible for red harvester ant colonies to make an accurate and rapid adjustment of foraging activity that corresponds to the current availability of food while using positive feedback for regulation of the process: the faster outgoing foragers meet ants returning with seeds, the more ants go out to forage. Ants then continue to use these local cues in finding food, as they use their olfactory senses to pick up pheromone trails laid by other ants and follow the trail in a descending gradient to the food source. Instead of being directed by other ants or being told as to where the food is, ants rely on their closely coupled action and perception systems to collectively complete the global task.\n\nWhile red harvester ant colonies achieve their global goals using a decentralised system, not all insect colonies function this way. For example, the foraging behaviour of \"wasps\" is under the constant regulation and control of the queen.\n\nA market economy is an economy in which decisions on investment and the allocation of producer goods are mainly made through markets and not by a plan of production (see planned economy). A market economy is a decentralised economic system because it does not function via a central, economic plan (which is usually headed by a governmental body) but instead, acts through the distributed, local interactions in the market (e.g. individual investments). While a \"market economy\" is a broad term and can differ greatly in terms of state or governmental control (and thus central control), the final \"behaviour\" of any market economy emerges from these local interactions and is not directly the result of a central body's set of instructions or regulation.\n\nWhile classic artificial intelligence (AI) in the 1970s was focused on knowledge-based systems or planning robots, Rodney Brooks' behaviour-based robots and their success in acting in the real, unpredictably changing world has led many AI researchers to shift from a planned, centralised symbolic architecture to studying intelligence as an emergent product of simple interactions. This thus reflects a general shift from applying a centralised system in robotics to applying a more decentralised system based on local interactions at various levels of abstraction.\n\nFor example, largely stemming from Newell and Simon's physical-symbol theory, researchers in the 1970s designed robots with a course of action that, when executed, would result in the achievement of some desired goal; thus the robots were seen as \"intelligent\" if they could follow the directions of their central controller (the program or the programmer) (for an example, see STRIPS). However, upon Rodney Brooks' introduction of subsumption architecture, which enabled robots to perform \"intelligent\" behaviour without using symbolic knowledge or explicit reasoning, increasingly more researchers have viewed intelligent behaviour as an emergent property that arises from an agent's interaction with the environment, including other agents in that environment.\n\nWhile certain researchers have begun to design their robots with closely coupled perception and action systems and attempted to embody and situate their agents a la Brooks, other researchers have attempted to simulate multi-agent behaviour and thus further dissect the phenomena of decentralised systems in achieving global goals. For example, in 1996, Minar, Burkhard, Lang-ton and Askenazi created a multi-agent software platform for the stimulation of interacting agents and their emergent collective behaviour called \"Swarm\". While the basic unit in Swarm is the \"swarm\", a collection of agents executing a schedule of actions, agents can be composed of swarms of other agents in nested structures. As the software also provides object-oriented libraries of reusable components for building models and analyzing, displaying and controlling experiments on those models, it ultimately attempts to not only simulate multi-agent behaviour but to serve as a basis for further exploration of how collective groups of agents can achieve global goals through careful, yet implicit, coordination.\n\n\nExamples of decentralized systems:\n\n\nExamples of \"decentralized system culture\": Small Is Beautiful\n\n"}
{"id": "1009041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1009041", "title": "Fight Club", "text": "Fight Club\n\nFight Club is a 1999 film based on the 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk. It was directed by David Fincher and stars Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter. Norton plays the unnamed narrator, who is discontent with his white-collar job. He forms a \"fight club\" with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled in a relationship with him and a destitute woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).\n\nPalahniuk's novel was optioned by 20th Century Fox producer Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls to write the film adaptation. Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. He and the cast compared the film to \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955) and \"The Graduate\" (1967), with a theme of conflict between Generation X and the value system of advertising. Fincher used the homoerotic overtones of Palahniuk's novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from anticipating the twist ending.\n\nStudio executives did not like the film and restructured Fincher's marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. \"Fight Club\" failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office and received polarized reviews, becoming one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the year. Critics praised the acting, directing, and themes, but debated the violence and moral ambiguity. Over time, however, critical and public reception towards the film has become largely positive, and the film found success with its DVD release, which established \"Fight Club\" as a cult film. Many have called \"Fight Club\" one of the greatest films of all time.\n\nThe unnamed Narrator is an automobile recall specialist who is unfulfilled by his job and possessions, and has developed severe Insomnia. He finds catharsis by posing as a sufferer of testicular cancer and other afflictions in support groups, helping his insomnia. His bliss is disturbed by another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him he is attending these groups dishonestly. The two agree to split which groups they attend, but not before Marla gives him her number.\n\nOn a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets and interacts with soap salesman Tyler Durden. The Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. Deciding against asking Marla for help, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. Tyler says the Narrator is beholden to consumerism. In the parking lot, he asks the Narrator to hit him, and they begin a fistfight.\n\nThe Narrator moves into Tyler's home: a large, dilapidated house in an industrial area. They have further fights outside the bar, which attract growing crowds of men. The fights moves to the bar's basement where the men form Fight Club, which routinely meets for the men to fight recreationally.\n\nMarla overdoses on pills and telephones the Narrator for help; he ignores her, but Tyler goes to her apartment to save her. Tyler and Marla get romantically involved, and Tyler warns the Narrator never to talk to Marla about him. The Narrator blackmails his boss and quits his job.\n\nFight clubs form across the country. Tyler recruits their members to a new anti-materialist and anti-corporate organization, Project Mayhem, without the Narrator's involvement. The group engages in subversive acts of vandalism and violence, increasingly troubling the Narrator. After the Narrator complains that Tyler has excluded him, Tyler leaves the house. The Narrator realizes that Tyler caused the explosion at his apartment.\n\nWhen a member of Project Mayhem is killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the Narrator tries to halt the project. He follows a paper trail to cities Tyler has visited to find him. In one city, a Project Mayhem member greets the Narrator as Tyler Durden. The Narrator calls Marla and discovers that she also believes he is Tyler. Tyler then appears in his hotel room and reveals that they are dissociated personalities in the same body; the Narrator became Tyler when he believed he was sleeping.\n\nThe Narrator blacks out. When he returns to the house, he uncovers Tyler's plans to erase debt by destroying buildings that contain credit card records. He apologizes to Marla and warns her that she is in danger, but she is tired of his contradictory behavior. He tries to warn the police, but the officers are members of the Project. He attempts to disarm the explosives in one building, but Tyler subdues him and holds him at gunpoint on the top floor. The Narrator realizes that, as he and Tyler are the same person, he is holding the gun. He fires it into his own mouth, shooting through his cheek, and Tyler collapses with an exit wound on his head and disappears. Project Mayhem members bring a kidnapped Marla to the building. Holding hands, the Narrator and Marla watch as the explosives detonate, collapsing buildings around them.\n\n\nAdditional roles include: Thom Gossom Jr. as Detective Stern, a police investigator who looks into the Narrator's apartment explosion; Bob Stephenson as an airport security officer who detains the Narrator; Joon B. Kim as Raymond K. Hessel, a young convenient store clerk; Peter Iacangelo as Lou, an aggressive man who owns the bar fight club is held in and David Andrews as Thomas, a member of the Narrator's testicular cancer support group. Tim de Zarn, Ezra Buzzington, and David Lee Smith appear as the Narrator's co-workers, and Richmond Arquette portrays his doctor.\n\nHolt McCallany, Eion Bailey, Paul Carafotes, Mark Fite, Michael Shamus Wiles, and Joel Bissonnette portray members of Project Mayhem, and Stuart Blumberg and Matt Winston play individuals harassed by the group. Leonard Termo, Van Quattro, Markus Redmond, and Michael Girardin appear as members of law enforcement also involved in fight club.\n\nDirector David Fincher said \"Fight Club\" is a coming of age film, like the 1967 film \"The Graduate\" but for people in their 30s. Fincher described the Narrator as an \"everyman\"; the character is identified in the script as \"Jack\", but left unnamed in the film. Fincher outlined the Narrator's background: \"He's tried to do everything he was taught to do, tried to fit into the world by becoming the thing he isn't.\" He cannot find happiness, so he travels on a path to enlightenment in which he must \"kill\" his parents, god, and teacher. By the start of the film, he has \"killed off\" his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler Durden.\n\nThe character is a 1990s inverse of the \"Graduate\" archetype: \"a guy who does \"not\" have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has \"no\" possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life.\" He is confused and angry, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean \"Übermensch\", in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator wants to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life \"that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications\". Fincher explained: \"[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: you're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now.\" While studio executives worried that \"Fight Club\" was going to be \"sinister and seditious\", Fincher sought to make it \"funny and seditious\" by including humor to temper the sinister element.\n\nScreenwriter Jim Uhls described the film as a romantic comedy, explaining: \"It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which \"seems\" unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them—because both characters are out on the edge psychologically.\" The Narrator seeks intimacy, but avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her. While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler. The Narrator is comfortable being personally connected to Tyler, but becomes jealous when Tyler becomes sexually involved with Marla. When the Narrator argues with Tyler about their friendship, Tyler tells him that being friends is secondary to pursuing the philosophy they have been exploring. When Tyler implies that Marla is a risk they should remove, the Narrator realizes he should have focused on her and begins to diverge from Tyler's path.\nThe Narrator, an unreliable narrator, is not immediately aware that he is mentally projecting Tyler. He also mistakenly promotes the fight clubs as a way to feel powerful, though the Narrator's physical condition worsens while Tyler Durden's appearance improves. While Tyler desires \"real experiences\" of actual fights like the Narrator at first, he manifests a nihilistic attitude of rejecting and destroying institutions and value systems. His impulsive nature, representing the id, is seductive and liberating to the Narrator and the members of Project Mayhem. Tyler's initiatives and methods become dehumanizing; he orders around the members of Project Mayhem with a megaphone similar to camp directors at Chinese re-education camps. The Narrator pulls back from Tyler and arrives at a middle ground between his conflicting selves.\n\n\"Fight Club\" examines Generation X angst as '\"the middle children of history\". Norton said it examines the value conflicts of Generation X as the first generation raised on television: this generation \"its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture\", and was told one could achieve \"spiritual happiness through home furnishing\". His character walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion: \"It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness.\" Pitt said, \"\"Fight Club\" is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so for the first time we can experience the pain.\"\n\n\"Fight Club\" also parallels the 1955 film \"Rebel Without a Cause\"; both probe the frustrations of the people in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to \"a generation of spectators\". A culture of advertising defines society's \"external signifiers of happiness\", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references consumer products such as Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, \"We smash it ... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us.\" Pitt explained the dissonance: \"I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end.\"\n\nThe violence of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify combat, but for participants to experience feeling in a society where they are otherwise numb. The fights represent a resistance to the impulse to be \"cocooned\" in society. Norton believed the fighting strips away the \"fear of pain\" and \"the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth\", leaving them to experience something valuable. When the fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the revolutionary dialectic by Tyler Durden; the Narrator pulls back and rejects Durden's ideas. \"Fight Club\" purposely shapes an ambiguous message whose interpretation is left to the audience. Fincher said: \"I love this idea that you can have fascism without offering any direction or solution. Isn't the point of fascism to say, 'This is the way we should be going'? But this movie couldn't be further from offering \"any\" kind of solution.\"\n\nThe novel \"Fight Club\" by Chuck Palahniuk was published in 1996. Before its publication, a 20th Century Fox book scout sent a galley proof of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof as a candidate for a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers Lawrence Bender and Art Linson, who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to Laura Ziskin, head of the division Fox 2000, who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to \"Fight Club\" from Palahniuk for $10,000.\n\nZiskin initially considered hiring Buck Henry to write the adaptation, finding \"Fight Club\" similar to the 1967 film \"The Graduate\", which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, Jim Uhls, lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered Peter Jackson the best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film \"The Frighteners\" in New Zealand. Bryan Singer received the book but did not read it. Danny Boyle met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. David Fincher, who had read \"Fight Club\" and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film \"Alien 3\" for the studio. To repair his relationship with the studio, he met with Ziskin and studio head Bill Mechanic. In August 1997, 20th Century Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation of \"Fight Club\".\n\nProducer Ross Bell met with actor Russell Crowe to discuss his candidacy for the role of Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with Pitt regarding the same role. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe. Pitt was looking for a new film after the failure (in the US market) of his 1998 film \"Meet Joe Black\", and the studio believed \"Fight Club\" would be more commercially successful with a major star. The studio signed Pitt for US$17.5 million.\n\nFor the role of the unnamed Narrator, the studio desired a \"sexier marquee name\" such as Matt Damon to increase the film's commercial prospects; it also considered Sean Penn. Fincher instead considered Norton based on his performance in the 1996 film \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\". Other studios were approaching Norton for leading roles in developing films like \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" and \"Man on the Moon\". He was cast in \"Runaway Jury\", but the film did not reach production. 20th Century Fox offered Norton $2.5 million for \"Fight Club\". He could not accept the offer immediately because he still owed Paramount Pictures a film; he had signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary. Norton later satisfied the obligation with his role in the 2003 film \"The Italian Job\".\n\nIn January 1998, 20th Century Fox announced that Pitt and Norton had been cast. The actors prepared by taking lessons in boxing, taekwondo, grappling, and soapmaking. Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so his character would not have perfect teeth. The pieces were restored after filming concluded.\n\nFincher's first choice for the role of Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo, who objected to the film's sexual content. The filmmakers considered Courtney Love and Winona Ryder as early candidates. The studio wanted to cast Reese Witherspoon, but Fincher felt she was too young. He chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film \"The Wings of the Dove\".\n\nUhls started working on a draft of the adapted screenplay, which excluded a voice-over because the industry perceived at the time that the technique was \"hackneyed and trite\". When Fincher joined the film, he thought that the film should have a voice-over, believing that the film's humor came from the Narrator's voice. He described the film without a voice-over as seemingly \"sad and pathetic\". Fincher and Uhls revised the script for six to seven months and by 1997 had a third draft that reordered the story and left out several major elements. When Pitt was cast, he was concerned that his character, Tyler Durden, was too one-dimensional. Fincher sought the advice of writer-director Cameron Crowe, who suggested giving the character more ambiguity. Fincher also hired screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker for assistance. He invited Pitt and Norton to help revise the script, and the group drafted five revisions in the course of a year.\n\nPalahniuk praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel and applauded how the film's plot was more streamlined than the book's. Palahniuk recalled how the writers debated if film audiences would believe the plot twist from the novel. Fincher supported including the twist, arguing, \"If they accept everything up to this point, they'll accept the plot twist. If they're still in the theater, they'll stay with it.\" Palahniuk's novel also contained homoerotic overtones, which Fincher included in the film to make audiences uncomfortable and accentuate the surprise of the twists. The bathroom scene where Tyler Durden bathes next to the Narrator is an example of the overtones; the line, \"I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need,\" was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality. Another example is the scene at the beginning of the film in which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the Narrator's mouth.\n\nThe Narrator finds redemption at the end of the film by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the Narrator is placed in a mental institution. Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in \"The Graduate\", indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self. Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him: \"I wanted people to love Tyler, but I also wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing.\"\n\nStudio executives Mechanic and Ziskin planned an initial budget of US$23 million to finance the film, but by the start of production, the budget was increased to $50 million. Half was paid by New Regency, but during filming, the projected budget escalated to US$67 million. New Regency's head and \"Fight Club\" executive producer Arnon Milchan petitioned Fincher to reduce costs by at least US$5 million. Fincher refused, so Milchan threatened Mechanic that New Regency would withdraw financing. Mechanic sought to restore Milchan's support by sending him tapes of dailies from \"Fight Club\". After seeing three weeks of filming, Milchan reinstated New Regency's financial backing. The final production budget was $63 million.\n\nThe fight scenes were heavily choreographed, but the actors were required to \"go full out\" to capture realistic effects such as having the wind knocked out of them. Makeup artist Julie Pearce, who had worked for Fincher on the 1997 film \"The Game\", studied mixed martial arts and pay-per-view boxing to portray the fighters accurately. She designed an extra's ear to have cartilage missing, inspired by the boxing match in which Mike Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield's ear. Makeup artists devised two methods to create sweat on cue: spraying mineral water over a coat of Vaseline, and using the unadulterated water for \"wet sweat\". Meat Loaf, who plays a fight club member who has \"bitch tits\", wore a 90-pound (40 kg) fat harness that gave him large breasts. He also wore eight-inch (20 cm) lifts in his scenes with Norton to be taller than him.\n\nThe locations were in and around Los Angeles and on sets built at the studio in Century City. Production designer Alex McDowell constructed more than 70 sets. The exterior of Tyler Durden's house was built in San Pedro, California, while the interior was built on a sound stage at the studio's location. The interior was given a decayed look to illustrate the deconstructed world of the characters. Marla Singer's apartment was based on photographs of the Rosalind Apartments in downtown LA. Overall production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, and complex special effects. Fincher compared \"Fight Club\" to his succeeding and less complex film \"Panic Room\", \"I felt like I was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on.\"\n\nFincher used the Super 35 format to film \"Fight Club\" since it gave him maximum flexibility to compose shots. He hired Jeff Cronenweth as cinematographer; Cronenweth's father Jordan Cronenweth had been cinematographer for Fincher's 1992 film \"Alien 3,\" but left midway through production due to Parkinson's disease. Fincher explored visual styles in his previous films \"Seven\" and \"The Game\", and he and Cronenweth drew elements from these styles for \"Fight Club\".\n\nFincher and Cronenweth applied a lurid style, choosing to make people \"sort of shiny\". The appearance of the Narrator's scenes without Tyler were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as \"more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense—a visual metaphor of what [the Narrator is] heading into\". The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction. Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a \"smack-fiend patina\". Fincher and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film \"American Graffiti\", which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.\n\nThe crew took advantage of both natural and practical light. Fincher sought various approaches to the lighting setups; for example, he chose several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. The crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries. On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis' technique as the influence.\n\n\"Fight Club\" was filmed mostly at night, and Fincher filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in the basement and instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.\n\nThe scenes with Tyler were staged to conceal that the character was a mental projection of the unnamed Narrator. Tyler was not filmed in two shots with a group of people, nor was he shown in any over-the-shoulder shots in scenes where Tyler gives the Narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the Narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's presence in single frames for subliminal effect. Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a \"little devil on the shoulder\". Fincher explained the subliminal frames: \"Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the Narrator's consciousness.\"\n\nWhile Cronenweth generally rated and exposed the Kodak film stock normally on \"Fight Club\", several other techniques were applied to change its appearance. Flashing was implemented on much of the exterior night photography, the contrast was stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to be underexposed, Technicolor's ENR silver retention was used on a select number of prints to increase the density of the blacks, and high-contrast print stocks were chosen to create a \"stepped-on\" look on the print with a dirty patina.\n\nFincher hired visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug, who worked for him on \"The Game\", to create visual effects for \"Fight Club\". Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, \"We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility's weakness.\" Fincher visualized the Narrator's perspective through a \"mind's eye\" view and structured a myopic framework for the film audiences. Fincher also used previsualized footage of challenging main-unit and visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during the actual filming.\n\nThe film's title sequence is a 90-second visual effects composition that depicts the inside of the Narrator's brain at a microscopic level; the camera pulls back to the outside, starting at his fear center and following the thought processes initiated by his fear impulse. The sequence, designed in part by Fincher, was budgeted separately from the rest of the film at first, but the sequence was awarded by the studio in January 1999. Fincher hired Digital Domain and its visual effects supervisor Kevin Mack, who won an Academy Award for Visual Effects for the 1998 film \"What Dreams May Come\", for the sequence. The company mapped the computer-generated brain using an L-system, and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull included neurons, action potentials, and a hair follicle. Haug explained the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, \"While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking like electron microscope photography, that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night dive—wet, scary, and with a low depth of field.\" The shallow depth of field was accomplished with the ray tracing process.\n\nOther visual effects include an early scene in which the camera flashes past city streets to survey Project Mayhem's destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots; the sequence was a three-dimensional composition of nearly 100 photographs of Los Angeles and Century City by photographer Michael Douglas Middleton. The final scene of the demolition of the credit card office buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant; Baily worked on the scene for over fourteen months.\n\nMidway through the film, Tyler Durden points out the cue mark—nicknamed \"cigarette burn\" in the film—to the audience. The scene represents a turning point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the \"fairly subjective reality\" that existed earlier in the film. Fincher explained: \"Suddenly it's as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers have to start looking at the movie in a whole new way.\"\n\nFincher was concerned that bands experienced in writing film scores would be unable to tie the movie's themes together, so he sought a band which had never recorded for film. He pursued Radiohead, but singer Thom Yorke declined as he was recovering from the stress of promoting their album \"OK Computer\". Fincher instead commissioned the breakbeat producing duo Dust Brothers, who created a post-modern score encompassing drum loops, electronic scratches, and computerized samples. Dust Brothers performer Michael Simpson explained the setup: \"Fincher wanted to break new ground with everything about the movie, and a nontraditional score helped achieve that.\" The film's climax and end credits feature the song \"Where Is My Mind?\" by the Pixies.\n\nFilming concluded in December 1998, and Fincher edited the footage in early 1999 to prepare \"Fight Club\" for a screening with senior executives. They did not receive the film positively and were concerned that there would not be an audience for the film. Executive producer Art Linson, who supported the film, recalled the response: \"So many incidences of \"Fight Club\" were alarming, no group of executives could narrow them down.\" Nevertheless, \"Fight Club\" was originally slated to be released in July 1999 but was later changed to August 6, 1999. The studio further delayed the film's release, this time to autumn, citing a crowded summer schedule and a hurried post-production process. Outsiders attributed the delays to the Columbine High School massacre earlier in the year.\n\nMarketing executives at 20th Century Fox faced difficulties in marketing \"Fight Club\" and at one point considered marketing it as an art film. They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy to devise a marketing plan. The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title \"Fight Club\" embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered \"a bad joke\" by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake public service announcements presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20 million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes. The studio advertised \"Fight Club\" on cable during World Wrestling Entertainment broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film. Linson believed that the \"ill-conceived one-dimensional\" marketing by marketing executive Robert Harper largely contributed to \"Fight Club\"s lukewarm box office performance in the United States.\n\nThe studio held \"Fight Club\"s world premiere at the 56th Venice International Film Festival on September 10, 1999. For the American theatrical release, the studio hired the National Research Group to test screen the film; the group predicted the film would gross between US$13 million and US$15 million in its opening weekend. \"Fight Club\" opened commercially in the United States and Canada on October 15, 1999 and earned US$11 million in 1,963 theaters over the opening weekend. The film ranked first at the weekend box office, defeating \"Double Jeopardy\" and \"The Story of Us\", a fellow weekend opener. The gender mix of audiences for \"Fight Club\", argued to be \"the ultimate anti-date flick\", was 61% male and 39% female; 58% of audiences were below the age of 21. Despite the film's top placement, its opening gross fell short of the studio's expectations. Over the second weekend, \"Fight Club\" dropped 42.6% in revenue, earning US$6.3 million. Against its production budget of , the film grossed from its theatrical run in the United States and Canada and earned in theaters worldwide. The underwhelming North American performance of \"Fight Club\" soured the relationship between 20th Century Fox's studio head Bill Mechanic and media executive Rupert Murdoch, which contributed to Mechanic's resignation in June 2000.\n\nThe British Board of Film Classification reviewed \"Fight Club\" for its November 12, 1999 release in the United Kingdom and removed two scenes involving \"an indulgence in the excitement of beating a (defenseless) man's face into a pulp\". The board assigned the film an 18 certificate, limiting the release to adult-only audiences in the UK. The BBFC did not censor any further, considering and dismissing claims that \"Fight Club\" contained \"dangerously instructive information\" and could \"encourage anti-social (behavior)\". The board decided, \"The film as a whole is—quite clearly—critical and sharply parodic of the amateur fascism which in part it portrays. Its central theme of male machismo (and the anti-social behaviour that flows from it) is emphatically rejected by the central character in the concluding reels.\" The scenes were restored in a two-disc DVD edition released in the UK in March 2007.\n\nFincher supervised the composition of the DVD packaging and was one of the first directors to participate in a film's transition to home media. The film was released in two DVD editions. The single-disc edition included a commentary track, while the two-disc special edition included the commentary track, behind-the-scenes clips, deleted scenes, trailers, fake public service announcements, the promotional music video \"This is Your Life\", Internet spots, still galleries, cast biographies, storyboards, and publicity materials. Fincher worked on the DVD as a way to finish his vision for the film. Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of creative development, said the DVD packaging complemented Fincher's vision: \"The film is meant to make you question. The package, by extension, tries to reflect an experience that you must experience for yourself. The more you look at it, the more you'll get out of it.\" The studio developed the packaging for two months. The two-disc special edition DVD was packaged to look covered in brown cardboard wrapper. The title \"Fight Club\" was labeled diagonally across the front, and packaging appeared tied with twine. Markell said, \"We wanted the package to be simple on the outside, so that there would be a dichotomy between the simplicity of brown paper wrapping and the intensity and chaos of what's inside.\" Deborah Mitchell, 20th Century Fox's vice president of marketing, described the design: \"From a retail standpoint, [the DVD case] has incredible shelf-presence.\"\n\n\"Fight Club\" won the 2000 Online Film Critics Society Awards for Best DVD, Best DVD Commentary, and Best DVD Special Features. \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked the film's two-disc edition in first place on its 2001 list of \"The 50 Essential DVDs\", giving top ratings to the DVD's content and technical picture-and-audio quality. When the two-disc edition went out of print, the studio re-released it in 2004 because of fans' requests. The film sold more than 6 million copies on DVD and video within the first ten years, making it one of the largest-selling home media items in the studio's history, in addition to grossing over $55 million in video and DVD rentals. With a weak box office performance in the United States and Canada, a better performance in other territories, and the highly successful DVD release, \"Fight Club\" generated a US$10 million profit for the studio.\n\nThe Laserdisc edition was only released in Japan on May 26, 2000 and features a different cover art, as well as one of the very few Dolby EX soundtracks released on LD. The VHS edition was released on October 31, 2000, as a part of 20th Century Fox's \"Premiere Series\" line. It includes a featurette after the film, \"Behind the Brawl\".\n\n\"Fight Club\" was released in the Blu-ray Disc format in the United States on November 17, 2009. Five graffiti artists were commissioned to create 30 pieces of art for the packaging, encompassing urban aesthetics found on the East Coast and West Coast of the United States as well as influences from European street art. The Blu-ray edition opens with a menu screen for the romantic comedy \"Never Been Kissed\" starring Drew Barrymore before leading into the \"Fight Club\" menu screen. Fincher got permission from Barrymore to include the fake menu screen.\n\nWhen \"Fight Club\" premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival, the film was fiercely debated by critics. A newspaper reported, \"Many loved and hated it in equal measures.\" Some critics expressed concern that the film would incite copycat behavior, such as that seen after \"A Clockwork Orange\" debuted in Britain nearly three decades previously. Upon the film's theatrical release, \"The Times\" reported the reaction: \"It touched a nerve in the male psyche that was debated in newspapers across the world.\" Although the film's makers called \"Fight Club\" \"an accurate portrayal of men in the 1990s,\" some critics called it \"irresponsible and appalling\". Writing for the \"Australian\" newspaper, Christopher Goodwin stated: \"\"Fight Club\" is shaping up to be the most contentious mainstream Hollywood meditation on violence since Stanley Kubrick's \"A Clockwork Orange\".\"\n\nJanet Maslin, reviewing for \"The New York Times\", praised Fincher's direction and editing of the film. She wrote that \"Fight Club\" carried a message of \"contemporary manhood\", and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism. Roger Ebert, reviewing for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", called \"Fight Club\" \"visceral and hard-edged\", but also \"a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy\", whose promising first act is followed by a second that panders to macho sensibilities and a third he dismissed as \"trickery\". Ebert later acknowledged that the film was \"beloved by most, not by me\". He was later requested to have a shot-by-shot analysis of \"Fight Club\" at the Conference on World Affairs; he stated that \"[s]eeing it over the course of a week, I admired its skill even more, and its thought even less.\" Jay Carr of \"The Boston Globe\" opined that the film began with an \"invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz\", but that it eventually became \"explosively silly\". \"Newsweek\"s David Ansen described \"Fight Club\" as \"an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload\" and thought that the ending was too pretentious. Richard Schickel of \"Time\" described the mise en scène as dark and damp: \"It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it's polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it's carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it's better to be wet than dry.\" Schickel applauded the performances of Pitt and Norton, but criticized the \"conventionally gimmicky\" unfolding and the failure to make Bonham Carter's character interesting.\n\n\"Cineaste\"s Gary Crowdus reviewed the critical reception in retrospect: \"Many critics praised \"Fight Club\", hailing it as one of the most exciting, original, and thought-provoking films of the year.\" He wrote of the negative opinion, \"While \"Fight Club\" had numerous critical champions, the film's critical attackers were far more vocal, a negative chorus which became hysterical about what they felt to be the excessively graphic scenes of fisticuffs ... They felt such scenes served only as a mindless glamorization of brutality, a morally irresponsible portrayal, which they feared might encourage impressionable young male viewers to set up their own real-life fight clubs in order to beat each other senseless.\"\n\n\"Fight Club\" was nominated for the 2000 Academy Award for Best Sound Editing, but it lost to \"The Matrix\". Bonham Carter won the 2000 Empire Award for Best British Actress. The Online Film Critics Society also nominated \"Fight Club\" for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor (Norton), Best Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay (Uhls). Though the film won none of the awards, the organization listed \"Fight Club\" as one of the top ten films of 1999. The soundtrack was nominated for a BRIT Award, losing to \"Notting Hill\".\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, \"Fight Club\" holds a rating of 79%, based on 165 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Solid acting, amazing direction, and elaborate production design make \"Fight Club\" a wild ride.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 66 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\"Fight Club\" was one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the 1990s. Like other films released that year, including \"Magnolia\", \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Three Kings\", \"Fight Club\" was recognized as an innovator in cinematic form and style since it exploited new developments in filmmaking technology. After \"Fight Club\"s theatrical release, it became more popular via word of mouth, and the positive reception of the DVD established it as a cult film that David Ansen of \"Newsweek\" conjectured would enjoy \"perennial\" fame. The film's success also heightened Palahniuk's profile to global renown.\n\nFollowing \"Fight Club\"s release, several fight clubs were reported to have started in the United States. A \"Gentleman's Fight Club\" was started in Menlo Park, California in 2000 and had members mostly from the tech industry. Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs. In 2006, an unwilling participant from a local high school was injured at a fight club in Arlington, Texas, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers. An unsanctioned fight club was also started at Princeton University, where matches were held on campus. The film was suspected of influencing Luke Helder, a college student who planted pipe bombs in mailboxes in 2002. Helder's goal was to create a smiley pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene in \"Fight Club\" in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior. On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks Coffee shop in the Upper East Side. The New York City Police Department reported the suspect was trying to emulate \"Project Mayhem\".\n\nA video game adaptation of the film, titled \"Fight Club\", was released by Vivendi in 2004 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and for mobile phones. The game was a critical and commercial failure, and was panned by such publications and websites as GameSpot, \"Game Informer\", and IGN.\n\nIn 2003, \"Fight Club\" was listed as one of the \"50 Best Guy Movies of All Time\" by \"Men's Journal\". In 2006 and 2008, \"Fight Club\" was voted by \"Empire\" readers as the eighth and tenth greatest film of all time, respectively. \"Total Film\" ranked \"Fight Club\" as \"The Greatest Film of our Lifetime\" in 2007 during the magazine's tenth anniversary. In 2007, \"Premiere\" selected Tyler Durden's line, \"The first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club,\" as the 27th greatest movie line of all time. In 2008, readers of \"Empire\" ranked Tyler Durden eighth on a list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters. \"Empire\" also identified \"Fight Club\" as the 10th greatest movie of all time in its 2008 issue \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\".\n\nIn 2010, two viral mash-up videos featuring \"Fight Club\" were released. \"Ferris Club\" was a mash-up of \"Fight Club\" and the 1986 film \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\". It portrayed Ferris as Tyler Durden and Cameron as the narrator, \"claiming to see the real psychological truth behind the John Hughes classic\". The second video \"Jane Austen's Fight Club\" also gained popularity online as a mash-up of \"Fight Club\"s fighting rules and the characters created by 19th century novelist Jane Austen.\n\n\n"}

In many modern western societies foster care can be organised by the state to care for children with troubled family backgrounds, usually on a temporary basis. In many pre-modern societies fosterage was a form of patronage, whereby influential families cemented political relationships by bringing up each other's children, similar to arranged marriages, also based on dynastic or alliance calculations.\n\nThis practice was once common in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland.\nIn his \"A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland\" (1775), writer Samuel Johnson described the fosterage custom as he saw it practised.\n\nFosterage or \"fostering\" is frequently referred to in the medieval Sagas of Icelanders. Original family ties and rights of inheritance were not affected, nor was it required for the fostered child to be an orphan or for the biological father to be deceased. Moreover, the fostering of another man's child was regarded as a source of honor to the birth father; and conventionally the fostering party was of inferior social status to the biological father. An exception to this convention is found in Njáls saga, where Njál Thorgeirsson, a very prominent man, fosters Hoskuld, the son of Thrain Sigfusson, after the death of Thrain in battle.\nPortions of Ireland, Scotland and the Hebrides were ruled for long periods of time by Norse invaders during the Middle Ages; but it is unknown which culture was the original source of the custom of fosterage.\n\nIn Ancient Ireland, ollams taught children either for payment or for no compensation. Children were taught a particular trade and treated like family; their original family ties were often severed.\n\nThere was similar custom in the Caucasus, called Atalik - .\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2295773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295773", "title": "Golden apple", "text": "Golden apple\n\nThe golden apple is an element that appears in various national and ethnic folk legends or fairy tales. Recurring themes depict a hero (for example Hercules or Făt-Frumos) retrieving the golden apples hidden or stolen by a monstrous antagonist. Alternatively, they are depicted as divine food and the source of immortality in Norse mythology, and as part of the mysterious apple branch of Otherworld in Irish mythology.\n\nThree instances of golden apples were featured in Greek mythology:\n\nThe first case concerns a huntress named Atalanta who raced against a suitor named Melanion. Melanion used golden apples to distract Atalanta so that he could win the race.\n\nThough abandoned by her father as an infant, Atalanta became a skilled hunter and received acclaim for her role in the hunt for the Calydonian boar. Her father claimed her as his daughter and wished to marry her off. However, Atalanta was reluctant to marry due to a prophecy that marriage would be her downfall. Because of her beauty, she gained a number of suitors and finally agreed to marry, but under the condition that her suitor was obligated to beat her in a footrace. Competitors who failed to beat her would be put to death. As Atalanta could run extremely fast, all her suitors died. Realizing that Atalanta could not be defeated in a fair race, Melanion prayed to Aphrodite for help. The goddess gave him three golden apples and told him to drop them one at a time to distract Atalanta. Sure enough, she quit running long enough to retrieve each golden apple. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Melanion finally succeeded, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.\n\nEventually they had a son Parthenopaios, who was one of the Seven against Thebes. Their marriage ended in misfortune when they were transformed into lions (which the Greeks believed were unable to mate with their own species, only with leopards) for offending the gods.\n\nZeus held a banquet in celebration of the marriage of Peleus and Thetis. Eris, the goddess of discord, was not invited for her troublesome nature, and upon turning up uninvited, she threw a golden apple into the ceremony, with an inscription that read: \"ΤΗΙ ΚΑΛΛΙΣΤΗΙ\" (, Modern Greek: τη καλλίστη \"ti kallisti\"; \"for/to the most beautiful\" – cf. Callisto). Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. They brought the matter before Zeus. Not wanting to get involved, Zeus assigned the task to Paris of Troy. Paris had demonstrated his exemplary fairness previously when he awarded a prize unhesitatingly to Ares after the god, in bull form, had bested his own prize bull.\n\nZeus gave the apple to Hermes and told him to deliver it to Paris and tell him that the goddesses would accept his decision without argument. As each goddess wanted to receive the apple, they each stripped off their own clothing and appeared naked before Paris. Each of the goddesses also offered Paris a gift as a bribe in return for the apple; Hera offered to make him the king of Europe and Asia Minor, Athena offered him wisdom and skill in battle, and Aphrodite offered to give to him the love of the world's most beautiful woman, Helen of Sparta, who was already married to King Menelaus. Paris chose Aphrodite, a decision that caused the Trojan war, and ultimately the destruction of both Paris and his city, Troy.\n\nSee \n\nIn Norse mythology, the golden apples are the source of the gods' immortality and perpetual youth; comparable to the role of ambrosia in Greek mythology. They are cultivated by—and most often associated with—the goddess Iðunn.\n\nIn the book \"Skáldskaparmál\", Iðunn is mentioned in its first chapter (numbered as 55) as one of eight ásynjur (goddesses) sitting in their thrones at a banquet in Asgard for Ægir. In chapter 56, Bragi tells Ægir about Iðunn's abduction by the jötunn Þjazi. Bragi says that after hitting an eagle (Þjazi in disguise) with a pole, Loki finds himself stuck to the bird, and being pulled further and further into the sky, his feet banging against stones, gravel, and trees, and he felt his arms might be pulled out from his shoulders. Loki shouted and begged the eagle for a truce, and the eagle responds that Loki would only be freed if he made a solemn vow to have Iðunn come outside of Asgard with her apples. Loki accepts and returns to his friends Odin and Hœnir. At the time the Þjazi and Loki agreed on, Loki lures Iðunn out of Asgard into \"a certain forest\", telling her that he had discovered some apples that she would find worth keeping, and told Iðunn that she ought to bring her apples with her so that she may compare them with the apples Loki discovered. Þjazi arrives in eagle shape, snatches Iðunn, flies away with her, and takes her to his home, Þrymheimr.\n\nThe Æsir begin to grow grey and old at the disappearance of Iðunn. The Æsir hold an assembly thing, where they ask one another when Iðunn had been seen last. The Æsir realize that the last time that Iðunn was seen was when she was going outside of Asgard with Loki, and so they have Loki arrested and brought to the assembly, where he is threatened with death and torture. Terrified, Loki says that he will search for Iðunn in the land of Jötunheimr if the goddess Freyja will lend him her \"falcon shape\". Freyja lends the falcon shape to Loki, and with it he flies north to Jötunheimr, and arrives a day later at Þjazi's home. Loki finds that Þjazi is out in a boat at sea, and that Iðunn is home alone. Loki turns her into a nut, holds her in his claws, and flies away with her as fast as possible.\n\nUpon Þjazi's arrival home, he finds that Iðunn is gone. Þjazi assumes his eagle shape, and chases after Loki, causing a storm wind. The Æsir see a falcon flying with a nut, as well as the pursuing eagle, so they go outside from Asgard, with loads of wood shavings. The falcon flies over the fortification, and drops down by the wall. The eagle is unable to stop when he misses the falcon, the feathers of the eagle catch fire, and he falls. The Æsir, close by, kill the jötunn Þjazi within the gates of Asgard, \"and this killing is greatly renowned.\"\n\nThe role of the Golden Apple is far more minor and less specific in Irish lore, mostly because it is an element of the Silver Branch, or \"Silver Bough\", symbol that is connected to the Celtic Otherworld.\n\nDescribed in The Voyage of Bran as \"a silver branch of the sacred apple-tree bearing blossoms\", it is said that \"to enter the Otherworld before the appointed hour marked by death, a passport was often necessary, and this was usually a silver branch,\" thus continuing the apple's divine connection found in Greek and Norse myth.\n\nThis connection is particularly strong regarding the Irish sea deity and Otherworld guardian Manannán mac Lir, as evidenced in the tale His Three Calls to Cormac. In this story Manannán gifts a \"branch of silver with three golden apples\" to King Cormac mac Airt and, when shaken, these golden apples produced a music that could put anybody to sleep. This gift however, was conditional in that the price was the King's family and, though they are eventually restored to him, Manannán used to silver branch of golden apples as the means to teach Cormac a harsh lesson. In addition, in her \"Gods and Fighting Men\" (1904), Augusta, Lady Gregory describes Manannán's gift as a \"shining branch having nine apples of red gold.\"\n\nIn Richard Wagner's \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", the golden apples have their own leitmotif. It is first sung by Fafner, when he explains to his brother Fasolt why they must take Freia away from the gods.\n\nIn Stravinsky's ballet The Firebird (1910) which is based upon an amalgam of Russian folk-legends, the hero Prince Ivan enters a garden where he witnesses 13 young Princesses' playing with Golden Apples which grow there. (Tableaux VII Scherzo. Jeux des princesses avec les pommes d'or / The Princesses' Game with the Golden Apples).\n\nMany European fairy tales begin when golden apples are stolen from a king, usually by a bird:\n\nThe William Butler Yeats poem \"The Song of the Wandering Aengus\", has the lines:\n\nThe Augusta, Lady Gregory play called \"The Golden Apple: A Play for Kiltartan Children\" is a fable in the invented Kiltartan dialect based on Irish mythology and folklore.\n\n\"The Golden Apples\" is the name of Southern writer, Eudora Welty's, fourth short story collection, published in 1949. The stories are interrelated and center around the citizens of the fictional town of Morgana, Mississippi.\n\nA golden apple plays a crucial role in the climax of David Mitchell's sixth novel \"The Bone Clocks\", published by Random House in 2014.\n\nThe contemporary religion Discordianism draws upon the Golden Apple of the goddess Eris, also known as the \"Apple of Discord\", which Eris used to set off the conflict among the goddesses of Olympus that lead to the Trojan War because she was not invited to a party (the so-called \"Original Snub\". Emblazoned upon the apple is the word \"Kallisti\" (\"to the fairest\"). The golden apple can be seen as a metaphor for a practical joke meant to cause cognitive dissonance in the target.\n\nMichael Hübner has suggested that the fruit of the Argan tree, endemic to the Sous Valley in present-day Morocco, may be the golden apples of the Hesperides. Arguing that the location matches most closely the description given in classical texts of Atlantis and the garden of the Hesperides, he notes that the ripe fruits look like small golden apples and have an aroma like baked apples. He equates the fruit, the seeds of which produce Argan oil, with Plato's account of Atlantean fruits \"which afford liquid and solid food and unguents\", and proposes that the trees' almost reptilian-scale like bark and thorns may have inspired the mythical guardian dragon of the golden apples, Ladon.\n\nIn many languages, the orange is referred to as a \"golden apple\". For example, the Greek \"χρυσομηλιά,\" and Latin \"pomum aurantium\" both literally describe oranges as \"golden apples\". Other languages, like German, Finnish, Hebrew, and Russian, have more complex etymologies for the word \"orange\" that can be traced back to the same idea.\n\nIn later years it was thought that the \"golden apples\" of myth might have actually been oranges, a fruit unknown to Europe and the Mediterranean before the Middle Ages. Under this assumption, the Greek botanical name chosen for all citrus species was \"Hesperidoeidē\" (Ἑσπεριδοειδῆ, \"hesperidoids\"). It was also used by Carl Linnaeus, who gave the name Hesperides to an order containing the genus Citrus, in allusion to the golden apples of the Hesperides, and is preserved in the term Hesperidium for the fruits of citrus and some other plants.\n\nOne reason why oranges might be considered to be \"magical\" in so many stories is because they bear flowers and fruit at the same time, unlike other fruit.\n\nFrequently, the term \"golden apple\" is used to refer to the quince, a fruit originating in the Middle East.\n\nThe tomato, unknown to the ancient world of the Greeks, is known as the \"pomodoro\" in Italian, meaning \"golden apple\" (from \"pomo d'oro\").\n\nGolden apples are also items that are featured in video games such as *Minecraft and *Hello Neighbor\n\n\n"}

When he moved to Woodstock, New York and began to tour with his brother Artie Traum, he made tapes (based on his 1965 book \"Fingerpicking Styles for Guitar\") for his guitar students to use when he was unavailable.\n\nHe also received letters from others who wanted to learn to play, so he made more tapes and sold them via classified advertisements in \"Guitar Player\", \"Rolling Stone\", and \"Sing Out!\" magazines.\n\nHe decided to turn this effort into the Homespun business, with his wife Jane as co-owner and his brother Artie assisting. They invited musicians they knew to record instructional tapes. Bill Keith (banjo) and Kenny Kosek (fiddle) were among the first to participate.\n\nHomespun's first instructional lessons were recorded in Traum's home and sold on five-inch reel-to-reel tapes, as cassettes were not yet generally available. The tapes were manually reproduced one by one at home: thus the name \"Homespun.\"\n\nTraum produced the sessions, and provided guidance for artists who were uncomfortable teaching. As the business grew, Traum traveled to other locations to record more musicians, and invited musicians outside their circle of friends to participate.\n\nIn 1983, Homespun introduced music instruction on VCR tapes, before most homes had video players. Through the years, Homespun has expanded its audio and video formats, moving from audio cassette and video tape to CDs, DVDs, and streaming media.\n\nThe Hal Leonard Corporation has been distributing Homespun products since 1995. Homespun products are also sold at their website, and the Roots music channel offers a web subscription service for Homespun streaming media.\n\nThe following is a partial list of artists who have provided music instruction on a Homespun release.\n\n"}

{"id": "795188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=795188", "title": "Luxury tax (sports)", "text": "Luxury tax (sports)\n\nA luxury tax in professional sports is a surcharge put on the aggregate payroll of a team to the extent to which it exceeds a predetermined guideline level set by the league. The ostensible purpose of this \"tax\" is to prevent teams in major markets with high incomes from signing almost all of the more talented players and hence destroying the competitive balance necessary for a sport to maintain fan interest. The money derived from the \"tax\" is either divided among the teams that play in the smaller markets, presumably to allow them to have more revenue to devote toward the contracts of high-quality players, or in the case of Major League Baseball, used by the league for other pre-defined purposes.\n\nIn North America, Major League Baseball has implemented the luxury tax system. The National Basketball Association also has a luxury tax provision; its utility is somewhat limited by the fact that the league also has a salary cap provision. The \"hard\" salary cap of the National Football League and the National Hockey League has prevented any need for a luxury tax arrangement.\n\nIn the Big 4 North American sports leagues (Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL), and National Hockey League (NHL)), there are three different methods employed to limit individual teams payroll: hard salary cap, soft salary cap with luxury tax, and luxury tax.\n\nA hard salary cap is where the league sets a maximum amount of money allowed for player salaries, and no team can exceed that limit.\n\nA soft salary cap has a set limit to player salaries, but there are several major exceptions that allow teams to exceed the salary cap. For example, in the case of the NBA, teams can exceed the salary cap when keeping players that are already on the team.\n\nA luxury tax system does not have a limit to how much money can be spent on player salaries. However, there is a tax levied on money spent above a threshold set by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the players union and the owners. For every dollar a team spends above the tax threshold, they must also pay some fraction to the league. This system is used to discourage teams from greatly exceeding the tax threshold, with the goal of ensuring parity between large and small market teams.\n\nAs explained by Fangraphs: \"Technically called the 'Competitive Balance Tax', the Luxury Tax is the punishment that large market teams get for spending too much money. While MLB does not have a set salary cap, the luxury tax charges teams with high payrolls a considerable amount of money, giving teams ample reason to want to keep their payrolls below that level.\"\n\nThe threshold level for the luxury tax will be $189MM in 2014 (up from $178MM from 2011-2013) and will remain at $189MM through 2016. From 2012 through 2016, teams who exceed the threshold for the first time must pay 17.5% of the amount they are over, 30% for the second consecutive year over, 40% for the third consecutive year over, and 50% for four or more consecutive years over the cap.\n\nOnly seven teams have ever exceeded the luxury tax threshold: the San Francisco Giants, the Boston Red Sox, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, the Detroit Tigers, the Los Angeles Dodgers, the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs for the very first time in 2016. Only the Red Sox, Dodgers and Yankees have exceeded it more than once. The LA Dodgers have exceed it four times. Boston has exceeded it six times. New York has exceeded it fourteen times, or, every year since it has been in enforcement. In aggregate, the Yankees have paid out some $325.00 MM, 73.78%, of the total fines assessed since the luxury tax began. \n\nIn 2016 a record six teams were issued the luxury tax by the MLB. The Los Angeles Dodgers ($31.8 million), the New York Yankees ($27.4 million), the Boston Red Sox ($4.5 million), the Detroit Tigers ($4 million), the San Francisco Giants ($3.4 million) and theChicago Cubs ($186.5 million).\n\nIn 2017 the same six teams from 2016 were issued the luxury tax by the MLB. Against the $195 million threshold + $13 million for player benefits, payrolls for the Los Angeles Dodgers ($244 million), New York Yankees ($209.3 million ), Boston Red Sox ($187.9 million), Detroit Tigers ($190.4 million), San Francisco Giants ($186.4 million) and Chicago Cubs ($199.5 million) were in excess. This was the 15th straight year the New York Yankees paid the luxury tax.\n\nIn 2018 only two teams met the luxury tax by the MLB: The Boston Red ($9.4 million) and The Washington Nationals ($1.2 million). Several teams came just under the $197 million tax threshold: The San Francisco Giants ($196.66 million), The Chicago Cubs ($183.9 million), Houston Astros ($182.4 million), Los Angeles Dodgers ($181.99 million) and New York Yankees ($178.8 million).\n\nThe luxury tax is separate from revenue sharing, which is a system to balance out the income distribution between large and small market teams by dividing money from merchandise sales and media contracts. The money generated from the luxury tax is not distributed to the rest of the league, as is the case with the NBA, but rather is used for other purposes. The first $2,375,400 and 50% of the remaining total are used to fund player benefits, 25% goes to the Industry Growth Fund, and the remaining 25% is used to defray teams' funding obligations from player benefits.\n\nThe NBA utilizes a soft salary cap, meaning there is a salary cap but there are a variety of exceptions that allow teams to exceed that cap. For example, teams can re-sign players already on the team to an amount up to the maximum salary allowed by the league for up to five years regardless of where their payroll is relative to the cap. This provision is known as the \"Larry Bird\" exception, named after the former Boston Celtics great who was retained by that team until his retirement under the provisions of this rule. The result is that the majority of teams are over the cap at any given time.\n\nIn addition to the soft cap, the NBA utilizes a luxury tax system that is applied if the team payroll exceeds a separate threshold higher than the salary cap. These teams pay a penalty for each dollar their team salary exceeds the tax level. From 2002 to 2013, if a team exceeded the luxury tax threshold, they must pay one dollar to the league for every dollar that they are over the limit. For the 2013-14 season and onward, teams paid an incremental rate based on their team salary. They also have to pay a repeat offender rate, which is an additional dollar for every dollar over.

It is based around the ideology of \"anti-utilitarianism\", a critique of economism in social sciences and instrumental rationalism in moral and political philosophy. The movement was founded in 1981 by sociologist Alain Caillé, with the establishment of its interdisciplinary monthly journal Revue du MAUSS which is still published and edited by Caillé.\n\nThe journal covers topics in economics, anthropology, sociology and political philosophy from an anti-utilitarian perspective. His name is both an acronym and a tribute to the famous anthropologist Marcel Mauss. The movement works to promote a third paradigm, as a complement to, or replacement for holism and methodological individualism.\n\nThe movement began through conversations between Caillé and Swiss anthropologist Gerald Berthoud wondering why the economic theory of Marcel Mauss based on obligatory reciprocity and debt did not provide any possibilities of a \"free gift\" motivated by empathy rather than rational self-interest. The movement's early efforts considered the possibility of reintroducing an aspect of genuine interest in the welfare of others in economic theory. Among the economic policies suggested by the movement is the basic income guarantee a concept originally developed by Thomas Paine.\n\n"}

The working title of the film was \"Rough Stuff\", and David Johansen also recorded a song by that name for the film.\n\nSean Armstrong (Hulk Hogan) is a former wrestler living in Palm Beach, Florida and suffering from wrestler-days' nightmares. Burt Wilson (Sherman Hemsley), Sean's friend and former manager, has a bum leg from saving Sean's life and financial difficulties with his personal security business. With much whining and acting, Burt manages to persuade Sean to take a bodyguard job for Alex Mason, Sr. (Austin Pendleton), the head of the prestigious tech firm, Mason Systems, which is developing a new anti-missile system, the Peacefinder Project. The vital information for this project is stored on a microchip. But it is neither the inventor nor the chip Sean has to guard - he is to look after the two Mason kids: Alex Jr. (Robert Hy Gorman) and Kate (Madeline Zima).\n\nAs it turns out, Alex and Kate are two highly mischievous brats who vie for their often-too-absent father's attention by wreaking havoc in the household via elaborate and rather vicious pranks and booby-traps, with their specialty targets being the nannies he has assigned to take care of them (Alex Sr. is a widower). Sean witnesses the last nanny jumping into the fountain in front of the house to extinguish the fire in her hair. However, their father proves to be either too distracted or too lenient, which causes the children to continue their schemes. Thinking that he is a new (albeit unusual) replacement, they find a new target in Sean. But after one prank too many, which involves a swimming pool full of red dye (\"the Pit of Blood\"), Sean finally exerts his authority and not only gets to quiet Alex and Kate down, he also manages to open the eyes of their father to his family problems, as well as bonding with the kids and managing to help them sort out problems of their own.\n\nHowever, the real trouble has just started. The unscrupulous and vain Tommy Thanatos (David Johansen) is after Alex Sr.'s chip, and he will not stop at anything to get it. As it turns out, Sean and Burt had been once at the receiving end of one of his schemes: he had ordered them to throw a match, and when they had not complied, he attempted to shoot them. However, Burt threw himself in front of Sean, taking the bullet in his right leg (thus his bum leg); Sean had chased Thanatos to the roof of the stadium, and after a furious fight Thanatos ended up plunging head-first into an empty pool. This accident fractured the top of his skull, forcing the attachment of a steel skullplate and removing part of his afro of which he was so proud.\n\nThanatos kidnaps Alex Sr. with the help of Frank Olsen (Raymond O'Connor), the corrupt security chief of Mason Systems (who is disposed of en route to the hideout), and demands of him to hand over the chip. When Alex Sr. (who stowed the chip in Kate's doll) refuses, Thanatos has Alex and Kate kidnapped in order to force him to comply. Despite a valiant effort, Sean is overpowered and Burt is taken as well, giving Thanatos an unexpected revenge bonus. But Sean manages to track down Thanatos, and with the help of his friends is able to beat the villains. As Thanatos prepares to charge Sean, Alex Sr. and the children activate an improvised electromagnet to launch him into the night sky, leaving only his skullplate.\n\nThe movie ends with Sean preparing to take a leave of absence from the Masons. But Alex and Kate intend to have him back much sooner - and therefore Sean falls victim to yet another prank.\n\n\nThe film grossed $4.3 million at the box office.\nThe film has been poorly received by critics, it currently holds a 7% score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n"}

In some traditions, his waka (canoe) became the South Island, known as \"Te Waka a Māui\". His last trick, which led to his death, involved the Goddess Hine-nui-te-pō. While attempting to make mankind immortal by changing into a worm, Māui entered her vagina, intent on leaving through her mouth while she slept. He was, however, crushed by the obsidian teeth in her vagina.\n\n\nThe offspring of Tū (humankind) increased and multiplied and did not know death until the generation of Māui-tikitiki. \n\nMāui is the son of Taranga, the wife of Makeatutara. He has a miraculous birth — his mother threw her premature infant into the sea wrapped in a tress of hair from her topknot (tikitiki) — hence Māui is known as Māui-tikitiki-a-Taranga. Ocean spirits find and wrap the child in seaweed. Sharn divine ancestor, Tama-nui-te-ra (or Rangi) then takes the child and nourishes him to adolescence.\n\nMāui emerged from the sea and traveled to his mother's house, finding his four brothers, Māui-taha, Māui-roto, Māui-pae, and Māui-waho. Māui's brothers are at first wary of the newcomer, but after he performed feats such as transforming himself into different kinds of birds, they acknowledged his power and admired him.\n\nAt first, Taranga does not recognise Māui as her child.\n\nWhen he became old enough, he came to his relatives while they were gathered in the marae, dancing and being merry. Maui crept in and sat down behind his brothers. Soon his mother called the children and found a strange child, who proved to be her son, and was taken in as one of the family. Some of the brothers were jealous, but the eldest addressed the others as follows:\n\nThus Maui was received in his home.\n\nMāui created the islands of New Zealand, altered the length of the day and obtained the secret of fire.\n\nIn his first expedition, Māui took the jaw-bone of his ancestress Muri-ranga-whenua and used it as a weapon to ensnare the Sun to lengthen the day, as the days were too short for people to finish their work. With the help of his brothers, Māui caught the Sun and beat him severely with the jaw-bone club until the Sun promised to move slower in the future.\n\nHis next exploit was to haul up land from the depth of the ocean. He used the jaw-bone as a fish-hook. Using blood from his nose as bait, Māui hauled a great fish up from the depths. When it emerged from the water, Māui left to find a priest to perform the appropriate ceremonies and prayers, leaving his brothers in charge. They, however, do not wait for Māui to return but begin to cut up the fish. The fish began to writhe in agony, causing it to break up into mountains, cliffs and valleys. If the brothers had listened to Māui, the island would have been a level plain, and people would have been able to travel with ease on its surface. Thus the North Island of New Zealand is known as Te Ika-a-Māui (The Fish of Māui), also known as Hāhau-whenua.\n\nIn Northern Māori traditions of New Zealand, Māui's canoe became the South Island, with Banks Peninsula marking the place supporting his foot as he pulled up that extremely heavy fish. Besides the official name of Te Waipounamu, another Māori name for the South Island is Te Waka-a-Māui, the canoe of Māui. In southern traditions, he sailed a canoe called Maahanui and after he had pulled up the North Island (Te Ika a Maui) he left Maahanui on top of a mountain in the foothills behind what is now Ashburton. That mountain now bears the name Maahanui, and the coastline between Banks Peninsula and the Waitaki River is called Te tai o Maahanui (the tides of Maahanui).In another myth, finding that fire has been lost, Māui resolves to find Mahuika the Fire-goddess and learn the secret art of obtaining fire. During his visit, his tricks made her furious, and although he obtains the secret of fire, he barely escapes with his life. He transforms himself into a hawk, but to no avail, for Mahuika sets both land and sea on fire. Māui prays to his great ancestors Tāwhirimātea and Whatiri-matakataka who answer by pouring rain to extinguish the fire. Soon after, Māui goes fishing with his sister Hina's husband, Irawaru. They disagree when their fishing lines get tangled, and when they returned to shore, Māui turns Irawaru into a dog. Hina is distraught and throws herself into the sea, but she does not die.\n\nMāui is staying with his mother and brothers. Each morning Taranga disappears. Taking the shape of a kererū (wood pigeon), Māui follows her and finds her with his father, Makeatutara. When Māui's father is performing baptismal ceremonies for Māui, he errs in the incantations and this ill omen leads, in the end, to Māui's death.\nAfter his early exploits, Māui considered himself ready to win immortality for humankind. His father tried to dissuade him, predicting that he will fail because of the mistakes in his baptismal ceremony. His father says to him, \"My son, I know that you are a brave fellow and that you have done all things. Yet I am afraid that there is someone who will defeat you.\"\n\n\"Who could that be?\" asked Māui.\n\n\"Your ancestress Hine-nui-te-pō (Goddess of the Night). You can see her flashing there on the horizon.\"\n\n\"Is she as strong as the sun?\" asked Māui. \"I trapped him and beat him. Is she greater than the sea, which is greater than the land? Yet I have dragged land from it. Now let us see whether we will find life or death.\"\n\nHis father answered, \"You are right, my last-born and the strength of my old age. Go, find your ancestress who lives at the side of the sky.\"\n\n\"What does she look like?\" asked Māui.\n\n\"The red flashing in the western sky comes from her,\" said the father. \"Her body is like a human being, but her eyes are greenstone, her hair sea-kelp, and her mouth is like a barracouta's mouth.\"\n\nMāui, undaunted, set out westward, with his companions, to the home of Hine-nui-te-pō. In some versions, his companions are the smallest birds of the forest, the tomtit, the robin, the grey warbler and the fantail. In other versions, his companions are his brothers. He finds Hine asleep with her legs apart, and he and his companions see sharp flints of obsidian and greenstone between her thighs. \"Now,\" Māui tells his friends, \"when I go into the body of this old woman, do not laugh at me. Wait until I come out again from her mouth. Then you may laugh as much as you want.\"\n\n\"You will be killed!\" was all the companions could say.\n\n\"If you laugh I will indeed be killed. But if I pass right through her body I will live, and she will die.\"\n\nThen he readied himself, winding the cord of his battle club tightly around his wrist and casting aside his garment. As Māui began his task, the cheeks of his watching friends puckered with suppressed laughter. As his head and arms disappear, one of his brothers - or the fantail bird - cannot hold back any longer and burst out in laughter. The old lady wakes, opens her eyes, claps her legs together and cuts Māui in two. Now Māui has become the first being to die and, because he had failed in his task, all human beings are mortal. The goddess keeps her position at the portal to the underworld through which all humans must travel.\n\nIn a rare version, a goddess named Rohe was Māui's wife. He mistreated her in a cruel and unusual way. He wished for her to exchange faces with him because she was beautiful and he was not. When she objected, he recited an incantation over her as she slept. When she awoke and realized what had happened, she left the living world and traveled to the underworld where she became a goddess of death.\n\nIn the 2016 Disney animated film \"Moana\", the demigod Maui is voiced by Dwayne Johnson. Abandoned by his human parents as a baby, he is given demigod status, shapeshifting powers, and a magic fish hook by the gods who take pity on him. He performs miracles to win back the love of humanity, each of which earns him an animated tattoo. He is fabled to have stolen the heart of Te Fiti, a powerful island goddess who creates life. The protagonist of the film, Moana, persuades him to help her return it. In his song \"You're Welcome,\" composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Maui mentions and takes credit for several of the deeds he is credited with in folklore. This Maui incorporates elements of Hawaiian mythology and other Polynesian narratives.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46970120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46970120", "title": "Pianwen", "text": "Pianwen\n\nPianwen (骈文, literally 'parallel writing') is a highly stylised prose style, prevalent throughout the history of Chinese literature. Its prominent features lie in its regular lines arranged in couplets; in its early history, these lines were mostly of either four or six characters, and so pianwen are also known as Four-Six Prose (四六文).\n\nWhile the pianwen form was frequently utilised in official writings, or in describing scenery, its tight restrictions in metrical, tonal and thematic terms restricted its literary development. Subsequent movements, such as the Classical Prose Movement, were a response to these restrictions, but pianwen would continue to be written until the end of the Imperial Chinese era and the widespread use of Vernacular Chinese in writing.\n\nAccording to the Shuowen Jiezi, the word 'pian' (骈), with a horse radical and the character for 'aligned, in line', originally referred to a two-horse carriage where the horses run alongside each other. This is analogous to the way pianwen couplets are aligned and parallel each other.\n\nThe characteristics and restrictions on pianwen prose evolved throughout its long history, but its key feature is the predominance of couplets. The Chinese couplet form is more tightly restrained than in English; these restrictions include:\n\n\n豫章故郡，<br>\n洪都新府。<br>\n星分翼轸，<br>\n地接衡庐。\n\n\"Formerly Yuzhang Commandery, <br>\nCurrently Hongdu Prefecture. <br>\nAmong stars, it separates the Wings and Chariot Constellations, <br>\nOn the ground, it abuts the Heng and Lu Mountains...\"\n\n\nAt the same time, the use of uncommon words and allusions to literary or historical events was also emphasised.\n\nThe use of couplets in prose writing, with each line matching in length and reinforcing a certain theme, has ancient roots in Chinese prose; examples can be seen in the Book of Documents, dating from the Zhou Dynasty. Li Si's \"Jianzhuke Shu\" (Petition against the Expulsion of Guest-officers), from the Warring States period, also contained couplets.\n\nHowever, the writing of essays composed almost entirely of such couplets first arose during the Han Dynasty, and became widespread during the Wei-Jin period and the Northern and Southern Dynasties. The pianwen form was especially suited to the descriptive themes common in this period, and during the Southern Dynasties it became obligatory to write court documents in the pianwen form as well; this explicit official backing further spurred the development of pianwen prose as an art form.\n\nA renowned pianwen essay is the Tengwang Ge Xu, written by the early Tang Dynasty poet Wang Bo; by the mid-Tang, however, the Classical Prose Movement headed by Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan challenged the pianwen form, advocating a return to the freer, more direct and less restrained prose that prevailed in pre-imperial times. While this movement waned in the late Tang era, it was revived under writers like Ouyang Xiu, Zeng Gong and Su Shi, and eventually the pianwen form fell out of favour as a literary form from the mid-Song onwards, in favour of the revived \"classical style\". The preference for freer prose can be seen in the grouping of the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song, all of whom were accomplished in the classical style rather than the pianwen form.\n\nDuring the Qing Dynasty, pianwen again experienced a resurgence, before falling into disuse as Vernacular Chinese overtook Classical Chinese as the standard written form of the language. The characteristics of vernacular Chinese, where many words are formed from more than one character, make it almost impossible to write the strictly parallel couplets demanded by pianwen.\n"}
{"id": "21621618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21621618", "title": "Post-80s", "text": "Post-80s\n\nThe Post-'80 (also the Post-1980, ) is a colloquial term which refers to the generation, especially in urban cities, whose members were born between 1980 and 1989 in Mainland China after the introduction of the one-child policy. This generation, the first to grow up entirely within the reformist era, currently ranges in age from to , making up a major portion of China's young adult demographic.\n\nIn English, this group is also sometimes called China's Generation Y after the use of the term in the book \"China’s Generation Y\" by Michael Stanat in 2005 (though he references the dates 1981–1995).\n\n\nIt is a generation of approximately 240 million people born between 1980 and 1990, although characteristics of the after-eighty generation have also been seen in those born in the 1990s. Growing up in modern China, this generation has been characterized by its optimism for the future, newfound excitement for consumerism, entrepreneurship, and acceptance of its historic role in transforming modern China into an economic superpower.\n\nThese people are also distinguished by their increased access to digital media such as computers, MP3 players and mobile phones. Post-'80ers in China often experience a palpable generation gap between them and their elders; while their parents lived during the Mao Zedong era, experienced famine and political instability and lack proper education because of the policies set forth under the Cultural Revolution, they live in an environment of tremendous economic growth and social change, high technology, and rigorous education standards. There is also a significant generation gap between them and Post-'90, who are even more thoroughly entrenched in digitality and capitalism.\n\nA clash between tradition and modern influences is noticeable in purchasing habits, career pursuits, and daily interaction between child and elders. Furthermore, young adults have been indirectly affected by forced government shutdowns of thousands of Internet bars each year that prevent the excessive use of the Internet. Young people are also affected by China's large socioeconomic divide between urban and rural residents and societal problems resulting from modernization.\n\nThe Post-'80 generation illuminates important questions not only about China's future but also those of the United States and the global economy. Several factors that may influence the generation are individualism, consumerism, modernization, and technology.\n\nWhen parents over-indulge their only child, who has no siblings as a result of the One Child Policy, the indulged children may be referred to as \"little emperors\" (\"xiaohuangdi\" 小皇帝). Many Chinese families have the 4-2-1 format: 4 grandparents, 2 parents, one child. Parents and grandparents eat less and spend less money on themselves, only so the youngster could feel physically and mentally strong, focus on one's studies and be successful later on in life.\n\nAlmost all Chinese families usually adopt a set of traditional Confucian values when raising their only child. Because Confucianism considers \"Ren\" (仁; love and social responsibility) the core emotion that develops moral conceptions into genuine personal motivation, a child who has received too much familial attention but also endured high mental and physical restrictions because the economic future of the family depends on their academic success directly leads to a situation that is often considered in academic and popular discourse as over-indulging the children, in opposition to concepts of \"Ren\" and filial piety (孝; \"xiao\"). There is substantial evidence that many young Chinese feel a heavy burden and a huge responsibility towards their parents, understanding that their performances in school or other domains can be of crucial consequences towards their family.\n\nDepending on the specific family conditions and children's mental healthy condition, this burden could lead to a diligent lifestyle by youngsters or to a more rebellious attitude to traditional Confucian codes or not being able to cope with such pressure nor develop self-discipline.\n\nWhile being nurtured by parents and relatives gives children some clear advantages and opportunities, the fact that a child doesn't have sibling who 'compete' with him or her in a younger age could also lead to some psychological difficultes as the child grows. \"Lacking adapting capabilities\" () is a description which is commonly associated with the new post-'80 generation. Since such children don't need to put any efforts in order to gain parents' attention or to win family resources, they develop no competitive abilities and have weak social skills once they are older and need to be self-sufficient.\n\nTraditionally seen as a rite of passage, marriage has been linked as milestones to adulthood. Yet, the Chinese millennials are late bloomers when it comes to marriage. Although some members of the millennials are well in their 30s, statistics show they are still living their lives as bachelors or bachelorettes. \n\nHaving grown up in times of modern consumerism and popular media, rather than the ideals of the Cultural Revolution, many single-children are inclined to spend large amounts of money on themselves and thus are a cornerstone of retail sales. Families which are well-off economically sometimes allow their children to indulge in the new materialistic sphere, while poorer families often still make efforts to keep their children inside the consumers' race, allowing them to purchase new clothes, new cell-phone brands, etc.\n\nPost-'80 in Hong Kong and the after-eighty generation in mainland China are for the most part different. The term Post-'80 () came into use in Hong Kong between 2009 and 2010, particularly during the course of the opposition to the Guangzhou-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, during which a group of young activists came to the forefront of the Hong Kong political scene. They are said to be \"post-materialist\" in outlook, and they are particularly vocal in issues such as urban development, culture and heritage, and political reform. Their campaigns include the fight for the preservation of Lee Tung Street, the Star Ferry Pier and the Queen's Pier, Choi Yuen Tsuen Village, real political reform (on June 23), and a citizen-oriented West Kowloon Cultural District. Their discourse mainly develops around themes such as anti-colonialism, sustainable development, and democracy.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Census, among the population that was never married, there was a large increase in the proportions for those in their 20s and 30s in 2011 in comparison to 1981. For young adults aged 25 to 29, the proportion who were never married increased from 26.0% of the population in 1981 to close to 73.1% in 2011. Even among individuals in their early 30s, the proportion of men who were never married increased from 15.0% in 1981 to 54.0% in 2011. For women, the increase was from 10.5% in 1981 to 43.4% in 2011. \n\n"}

The literary role of artificial life has evolved over time: early myths present animated objects as instruments of divine will, later stories treat their attempted creation as a blasphemy with inevitable consequences, and modern tales range from apocalyptic warnings against blind technological progress to explorations of the ethical questions raised by the possibility of sentient machines.\n\nRecently, a popular overview of the history of androids, robots, cyborgs and replicants from antiquity to the present has been published.<ref name=\"Glaser/Rossbach\"></ref> Treated fields of knowledge are: history of technology, history of medicine, philosophy, literature, film and art history, the range of topics discussed is worldwide.\n\nThe earliest examples were all presented as the results of divine intervention and include: The dry bones that came to life in the Book of Ezekiel (Chapter 37); three-legged self-navigating tables created by the god Hephaestus (Iliad xviii); and the statue Galatea, brought to life by the prayers of her creator Pygmalion.\n\nMore recent humaniform examples include the brooms from the legend of the sorcerer's apprentice derived from a tale by Lucian of Samosata in the 1st century AD, the Jewish legend of the golem created like Adam from clay, and Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\". These tales include an indictment of human folly at presuming to take on the role of creator.\n\nNotable mechanical representations of humans include the life-sized singing puppet \"Olimpia\" in the short story \"The Sandman\" by E.T.A. Hoffman in 1816 and a bipedal anthropomorphic mechanism in \"The Steam Man of the Prairies\" by Edward S. Ellis in 1868. These examples are stories about human-controlled mechanisms without autonomy or self-awareness.\n\nIn Lyman Frank Baum's children's novel \"Ozma of Oz\", the first-ever introduction of a humanoid-appearance mechanical man that would satisfy the later \"humanoid robot\" definition occurred in 1907 - some fifteen years before the word \"robot\" was coined - with Tik-Tok, powered with a trio of clockwork movements for his thinking, movement and speech, none of which he could wind up himself.\n\nThe first use of the word \"Robot\" was in Karel Čapek's play \"R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)\" written in 1920 and first performed in Czechoslovakia in 1921, in New York City in 1922 and an English edition published in 1923. Artificial living beings are created from a chemical substitute for protoplasm but over time they learn about violence from their human creators and begin to revolt. The play ends on an optimistic, even spiritual, note as the artificial biology leads a male and female robot to fall in love and inherit the earth.\n\nWhile Karel Čapek's play introduced the word \"robot\" into languages around the globe but he later wrote a letter to the Oxford English Dictionary of etymology in which he named his brother, painter and writer Josef Čapek, as its true inventor. In an article in the Czech Lidové noviny in 1933 he also explains that he originally wanted to call the creatures \"laboři\" from the Latin word \"labor\". Karel found the word too bookish and sought advice from Josef who suggested to call them \"robots\". The word, which is always capitalized in Čapek's play, derives from \"robota\" which means \"drudgery\" in Czech and means \"work\" in Slovak.)\n\nThe theme of robots has been picked up by science fiction writers and many volumes are focused on robots and their interaction with the human species. Of particular note is the work of Isaac Asimov as a large part of his work centers on robots. Asimov is particularly known for his creation of the \"Three laws of robotics\" which he uses in his stories as both to define his robots and how these interact within the worlds he creates.\n\n\n"}

Leaving school at an early age, he became a clerk at Rawson's Brewery, and rose to be manager.\n\nIn 1853, he attempted to become a coal merchant in London. \nHe failed and was reduced to destitution. \nHe himself told how for a time he lived in a common lodging for seven shillings and two pence a week.\n\nThrough this experience, he learnt to sympathise with the struggles of the poor, and when his good fortune returned, he resolved to devote his time to improving their condition.\n\nHis efforts were directed especially against what were known as \"coffin ships\": unseaworthy and overloaded vessels, often heavily insured, in which unscrupulous owners risked the lives of their crews.\n\nIn 1867, Plimsoll was elected as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Derby, and endeavoured in vain to pass a bill dealing with the subject of a safe load line on ships. The main problem was the number of powerful ship-owning MPs in Parliament.\n\nIn 1872, he published a work entitled \"Our Seamen\", which became well known throughout the country. Accordingly, on Plimsoll's motion in 1873, a Royal Commission was appointed, and in 1875 a government bill was introduced, which Plimsoll, though regarding it as inadequate, resolved to accept.\n\nOn 22 July, the Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, announced that the bill would be dropped. Plimsoll lost his self-control, applied the term \"villains\" to members of the House, and shook his fist in the Speaker's face.\n\nDisraeli moved that he be reprimanded, but on the suggestion of Lord Hartington agreed to adjourn the matter for a week to allow Plimsoll time for thought.\n\nEventually Plimsoll made an apology. Many people, however, shared his view that the bill had been stifled by the pressure of the shipowners, and popular feeling forced the government to pass a bill which in the following year was amended into the Merchant Shipping Act.\n\nThis gave stringent powers of inspection to the Board of Trade, and the mark that indicates the safe limit to which a ship may be loaded became generally known as Plimsoll's mark or line.\n\nPlimsoll was re-elected for Derby at the general election of 1880 by a great majority, but gave up his seat to William Vernon Harcourt, believing that the latter, as Home Secretary, could advance sailors' interests more effectively than any private member.\n\nOffered a seat by 30 constituencies, Plimsoll was an unsuccessful candidate in Sheffield Central in 1885. He did not re-enter the house, and later became estranged from the Liberal leaders by what he regarded as their breach of faith in neglecting the question of shipping reform.\n\nHe was for some years the honorary president of the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union, and drew attention to the horrors of the cattle-ships, where animals were transported under appalling and over-crowded conditions.\n\nLater, he visited the United States to try to secure the adoption of a less bitter tone towards England in the historical textbooks used in American schools. \nHe died in Folkestone on 3 June 1898, and is buried in St Martin's churchyard, Cheriton, Kent.\n\nPlimsoll married his first wife, Eliza Ann, daughter of Hugh Railton of Chapeltown, near Sheffield, in 1858. In Census 1871 they were enumerated in Hastings where Eliza Ann is recorded as being blind in her right eye and deaf in her left ear. She died in Australia in 1882. There were no children by this marriage. He married his second wife, Harriet Frankish, daughter of Mr. Joseph Armitage Wade, J.P., of Hull and Hornsea, in 1885. By this marriage there were six children, of whom a son, Samuel Richard Cobden Plimsoll, and two daughters survived him.\n\nIn 1873, the Samuel Plimsoll, an iron hulled full-rigged merchant sailing ship, was launched at the shipyard of Walter Hood & Co. in Aberdeen, Scotland for the Aberdeen White Star Line (G. Thompson & Co.). She was assigned the official British Reg. No. 65097 and the signal MKDH. In 1899, she caught fire in the Thames River and had to be scuttled, but was refloated and repaired in 1900. In 1902, she was severely dismasted and damaged on voyage to Port Chalmers, Australia. Towed to Sydney and subsequently to Fremantle, she was reduced to hulk status the following year.\n\nIn the 1920s, Plimsoll shoes were named for their similarity in appearance to the Plimsoll line on boats.\n\nIn Whitehall Garden, a Victoria Embankment garden, there is a monument to Samuel Plimsoll in front of the railings.\n\nBritish writer Nicolette Jones published \"The Plimsoll Sensation\", a highly acclaimed biography – getting the idea for it from living in 1995 in Plimsoll Road in Finsbury Park, north London, but knowing hardly anything about whom it was named after.\n\nSamuel Plimsoll appears in the third series of the BBC historical television drama \"The Onedin Line\", portrayed by actor David Garfield.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "11875666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11875666", "title": "Slametan", "text": "Slametan\n\nThe slametan (or selametan, slamatan, and selamatan) is the communal feast from Java, symbolizing the social unity of those participating in it. Clifford Geertz considered it the core ritual in Javanese religion, in particular the abangan variant. The feast is common among the closely related Javanese, Sundanese and Madurese people.\n\nA slametan can be given to celebrate almost any occurrence, including birth, marriage, death, moving to a new house, and so forth. Depending on the intention, the mood and emphasis may vary somewhat, but the main structure is the same. Geertz categorizes them into four main types: \n\nThe ceremony takes its name from the Javanese word \"slamet\", from Arabic: \"salam\", which refers to a peaceful state of equanimity, in which nothing will happen. This is what the host intends for both himself and his guests, by experiencing the egalitarian structure of the slametan and the petitions of supernatural protection from spirits.\n\nIn Geertz's fieldwork in Mojokuto in the 1950s, he found that costs of slametans varied from 3 to 5,000 Indonesian rupiahs, depending on the type and the relative wealth of the host.\n\nSlametans are generally held in the evening, after evening prayer is finished. The date is determined either by the occurrence it is celebrating (for births and deaths, for example), or on auspicious days in the Javanese calendar. The guests, always men, are always close neighbors, and the selection of guests is based entirely on proximity, and not whether they are friends or relatives. They are called by a messenger of the host (usually a child of his) only five or ten minutes before the \"slametan\" is to begin, and they must drop whatever they are doing to come.\n\nWhen they arrive, the guests sit on floor mats around the food which has been placed in the center, while incense fills the room. The ceremony begins with a formal speech (\"udjub\") in high Javanese. The speech thanks the attendees for coming, presents the reason for the slametan, announces his intentions and petitions the spirits to secure for himself and his guests a state of equanimity (\"slamet\", hence the name of the ritual), and finally apologizes for any errors in his speech and the humble inadequacy of the food. During pauses in the speech, the audience responds with solemn \"inggih\" (\"yes\").\n\nFollowing the speech, somebody present gives an Arabic chant-prayer. Many will not know how, but the host makes sure that someone there had attended a religious school (usually a kyai); for special occasions he may even invite the village religious specialist (the \"modin\"). Fragments of the Koran, especially the al-Fatiha, are most commonly used, although special prayers may be used if they are known. At pauses the audience says \"amen\" (\"amin\"). The prayer leader receives a small payment (\"wadjib\").\n\nAt last, the food is served. While the ceremony is strictly for men, the food preparation falls upon the women in the family, who for larger ceremonies may draw on kin to assist in the preparation. Each guest receives a cup of tea and a banana-leaf dish containing each sort of food in the center of the room. The food is fancier than average, and each variety has a symbolic meaning, which is sometimes explained in the speech. The host himself does not eat, nor does he serve the food, which one or two of the guests do. When everybody has a dish, the host invites them to eat, which they do quickly without speaking. After a few minutes, and before eating most of the food, the guests excuse themselves, and finish eating the food in their own homes, with their own wives and children. The whole ceremony usually lasts only ten or fifteen minutes.\n\nAround birth, there are four major slametans and a number of minor ones. The four major ones are:\n\nThe circumcision slametan (\"islamam\" or \"sunatan\", held for boys between the ages of ten and fourteen) and the wedding slametan (\"kepanggihan\") are similar in their ceremony and foods offered, and can be seen as coming-of-age ceremonies for boys and girls, respectively.\n\nFunerals (\"layatan\") generally take place as soon as possible after the death, and inevitably involve the religious specialist (\"modin\") of the village. Slametans are held the day of the death, and then repeated in increasing size (both in number of guests and length of the chant) three, seven, forty, and 100 days after the death, the first and second anniversaries, and 1000 days after the death. The final one is the most elaborate, and is thought to mark the point when the body has completely decayed to dust.\n\nThe most important of the calendrical slametans are for the Prophet's birthday (\"Muludan\", on 12 Rabi' al-awwal) and near the end of Ramadan (\"Maleman\"). Other notable holidays infrequently have slametans, and Satu Suro, the New Year's Day (1 Muharram) is celebrated by those who are self-consciously anti-Muslim. Because these dates are shared by everybody, it is common to attend slametans for many of one's neighbors in succession. For this reason, they tend to be relatively small, and particularly based on the principle of inviting neighbors.\n\nThe \"bersih désa\" is always held in Dhu al-Qi'dah (\"Sela\"), the eleventh month, on different days according to village tradition. This slametan is given at the place of burial of the \"dhanyang désa\", the guardian spirit of the village. In santri villages, it may take place at a mosque and consist entirely of Muslim prayers. For this type of slametan, all families in the village are expected to contribute food, with the adult head of each family obliged to attend.\n\nGeertz's final category of slametans, intermittently occurring and dependent on a specific situation, are somewhat less frequent and tend to be smaller affairs. Reasons for holding these slametans include changing residences, changing names, going on a journey, bad dreams (it can prevent the fearful event), prevention or encouragement of rain, anniversaries of clubs and organizations, sorcery, healing, and others.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34357381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34357381", "title": "Speech acquisition", "text": "Speech acquisition\n\nSpeech acquisition focuses on the development of spoken language by a child. Speech consists of an organized set of sounds or phonemes that are used to convey meaning while language is an arbitrary association of symbols used according to prescribed rules to convey meaning.\nWhile grammatical and syntactic learning can be seen as a part of language acquisition, speech acquisition focuses on the development of speech perception and speech production over the first years of a child's lifetime. There are several models to explain the norms of speech sound or phoneme acquisition in children.\n\nSensory learning concerning acoustic speech signals already starts during pregnancy. Hepper and Shahidullah (1992) described the progression of fetal response to different pure tone frequencies. They suggested fetuses respond to 500 Hertz (Hz) at 19 weeks gestation, 250 Hz and 500 Hz at 27 weeks gestation and finally respond to 250, 500, 1000, 3000 Hz between 33 and 35 weeks gestation. Lanky and Williams (2005) suggested that fetuses could respond to pure tone stimuli of 500 Hz as early as 16 weeks.\n\nThe newborn is already capable of discerning many phonetic contrasts. This capability may be innate. \nSpeech perception becomes language-specific for vowels at around 6 months, for sound combinations at around 9 months and for language-specific consonants at around 11 months.\n\nIt is also important that a newborn is already capable of detecting typical word stress patterns around the age of 8 months.\n\nAs an infant grows into a child their ability to discriminate between speech sounds should increase. Rvachew (2007) described three developmental stages in which a child recognizes or discerns adult-like, phonological and articulatory representations of sounds.In the first stage, the child is generally unaware of phonological contrast and can produce sounds that are acoustically and perceptually similar. In the second stage the child is aware of phonological contrasts and can produce acoustically different variations imperceptible to adult listeners. Finally, in the third stage, children become aware of phonological contrasts and produce different sounds that are perceptually and acoustically accurate to an adult production.\n\nIt is suggested that a child's perceptual capabilities continue to develop for many years. Hazan and Barrett (2000) suggest that this development can cotton into late childhood; 6 to 12 year old children showed increasing mastery of discriminating synthesized differences in place, manner, and voicing of speech sounds with out yet achieving adult-like accuracy in their own production.\n\nInfants are born with the ability to vocalize, most notably through crying. As they grow and develop, infants add more sounds to their inventory. \nThere are two primary typologies of infant vocalizations. Typology 1: Stark Assessment of Early Vocal Development consists of 5 phases. \n\nTypology 2: Oller's typology of infant phonations consists primarily of 2 phases with several substages. The 2 primary phases include Non-speech-like vocalizations and Speech-like vocalizations. Non-speech-like vocalizations include a. vegetative sounds such as burping and b. fixed vocal signals like crying or laughing. Speech-like vocalizations consist of a. quasi-vowels, b. primitive articulation, c. expansion stage and d. canonical babbling.\n\nKnowing when a speech sound should be accurately produced helps parents and professionals determine when child may have an articulation disorder. There have been two traditional methods used to compare a child's articulation of speech sounds to chronological age. The first is comparing the number of correct responses on a standardized articulation test with the normative data for a given age on the same test. This allows evaluators to see how well a child is producing sounds compared to their same aged peers. The second method consists of comparing an individual sound a child produces with developmental norms for that individual sound. The second method can be difficult when considering the differing normative data and other factors that affect typical speech development. \nMany norms are based on age expectations in which a majority of children of a certain age are accurately producing a sound (75% or 90% depending on the study). Using the results from Sander (1972), Templin (1957), and Wellman, Case, Mengert, & Bradbury, (1931), the American Speech-Language Hearing Association suggests the following: Sounds mastered by age 3 include /p, m, h, n, w, b/; by age 4 /k, g, d, f, y/; by age 6 /t, ŋ, r, l/; by age 7 /tʃ, ʃ, j, θ/. and by age 8 /s, z, v, ð, ʒ/.\n\nShriberg (1993) proposed a model for speech sound acquisition known as the Early, Middle, and Late 8 based on 64 children with speech delays ages 3 to 6 years. Shriberg proposed that there were three stages of phoneme development. Using a profile of \"consonant mastery\" he developed the following:\n\n\n\n\n"}

S. Lewis. It is considered a classic of children's literature and is the author's best-known work, having sold over 100 million copies in 47 languages. Written by Lewis, illustrated by Pauline Baynes, and originally published in London between 1950 and 1956, \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" has been adapted several times, complete or in part, for radio, television, the stage, and film.\n\nSet in the fictional realm of Narnia, a fantasy world of magic, mythical beasts, and talking animals, the series narrates the adventures of various children who play central roles in the unfolding history of that world. Except in \"The Horse and His Boy\", the protagonists are all children from the real world, magically transported to Narnia, where they are called upon by the lion Aslan to protect Narnia from evil and restore the throne to its rightful line. The books span the entire history of Narnia, from its creation in \"The Magician's Nephew\" to its eventual destruction in \"The Last Battle\".\n\nInspiration for the series was taken from multiple sources; in addition to adapting numerous traditional Christian themes, Lewis freely borrowed characters and ideas from Greek and Roman mythology as well as from traditional British and Irish fairy tales.\n\nThe books have profoundly influenced adult and children's fantasy literature since World War II. Lewis's exploration of themes not usually present in children's literature, such as religion, as well as the books' perceived treatment of issues including race and gender, has caused some controversy.\n\nAlthough Lewis originally conceived what would become \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" in 1939 (the picture of a Faun with parcels in a snowy wood has a history dating to 1914), he did not finish writing the first book \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" until 1949. \"The Magician's Nephew\", the penultimate book to be published, but the last to be written, was completed in 1954. Lewis did not write the books in the order in which they were originally published, nor were they published in their current chronological order of presentation. The original illustrator, Pauline Baynes, created pen and ink drawings for the \"Narnia\" books that are still used in the editions published today. Lewis was awarded the 1956 Carnegie Medal for \"The Last Battle\", the final book in the saga. The series was first referred to as \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" by fellow children's author Roger Lancelyn Green in March 1951, after he had read and discussed with Lewis his recently completed fourth book \"The Silver Chair\", originally entitled \"Night under Narnia\".\n\nLewis described the origin of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" in an essay entitled \"It All Began with a Picture\":\nShortly before the start of World War II, many children were evacuated to the English countryside in anticipation of attacks on London and other major urban areas by Nazi Germany. As a result, on 2 September 1939, three school girls named Margaret, Mary and Katherine came to live at The Kilns in Risinghurst, Lewis's home three miles east of Oxford city centre. Lewis later suggested that the experience gave him a new appreciation of children and in late September he began a children's story on an odd sheet of paper which has survived as part of another manuscript:\n\nIn \"It All Began With a Picture\" C. S. Lewis continues:\n\nAlthough Lewis pled ignorance about the source of his inspiration for Aslan, Jared Lobdell, digging into Lewis’s history to explore the making of the series, suggests Charles Williams’s \"The Place of the Lion\" as a likely influence.\n\nThe manuscript for \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" was complete by the end of March 1949.\n\nThe name \"Narnia\" is based on Narni, Italy, written in Latin as \"Narnia\". Green wrote:\n\n\"The Chronicles of Narnia's\" seven books have been in continuous publication since 1956, selling over 100 million copies in 47 languages and with editions in Braille.\n\nThe first five books were originally published in the United Kingdom by Geoffrey Bles. The first edition of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" was released in London on 16 October 1950. Although three more books, \"Prince Caspian\", \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" and \"The Horse and His Boy\", were already complete, they were not released immediately at that time, but instead appeared (along with \"The Silver Chair\") one at a time in each of the subsequent years (1951–1954). The last two books (\"The Magician's Nephew\" and \"The Last Battle\") were published in the United Kingdom originally by The Bodley Head in 1955 and 1956.\n\nIn the United States, the publication rights were first owned by Macmillan Publishers, and later by HarperCollins. The two issued both hardcover and paperback editions of the series during their tenure as publishers, while at the same time Scholastic, Inc. produced paperback versions for sale primarily through direct mail order, book clubs, and book fairs. Harper Collins also published several one-volume collected editions containing the full text of the series. As noted below (see Reading order), the first American publisher, Macmillan, numbered the books in publication sequence, whereas Harper Collins, at the suggestion of Lewis's stepson, opted to use the series' internal chronological order when they won the rights to it in 1994. Scholastic switched the numbering of its paperback editions in 1994 to mirror that of Harper Collins.\n\nThe seven books that make up \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" are presented here in order of original publication date:\n\n\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", completed by the end of March 1949 and published by Geoffrey Bles in the United Kingdom on 16 October 1950, tells the story of four ordinary children: Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie, who have been evacuated to the English countryside from London in 1940 following the outbreak of World War II. They discover a wardrobe in Professor Digory Kirke's house that leads to the magical land of Narnia. The Pevensie children help Aslan, a talking lion, save Narnia from the evil White Witch, who has reigned over the land of Narnia for a century of perpetual winter with no Christmas. The children become kings and queens of this new-found land and establish the Golden Age of Narnia, leaving a legacy to be rediscovered in later books.\n\nCompleted after Christmas 1949 and published on 15 October 1951, \"Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia\" tells the story of the Pevensie children's second trip to Narnia. They are drawn back by the power of Susan's horn, blown by Prince Caspian to summon help in his hour of need. Narnia as they knew it is no more, as 1,300 years have passed, their castle is in ruins, and all Narnians have retreated so far within themselves that only Aslan's magic can wake them. Caspian has fled into the woods to escape his uncle, Miraz, who has usurped the throne. The children set out once again to save Narnia.\n\nWritten between January and February 1950 and published on 15 September 1952, \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" sees Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, along with their priggish cousin, Eustace Scrubb, return to Narnia, three years after their last departure. Once there, they join Caspian's voyage on the ship \"Dawn Treader\" to find the seven lords who were banished when Miraz took over the throne. This perilous journey brings them face to face with many wonders and dangers as they sail toward Aslan's country at the edge of the world.\n\nCompleted at the beginning of March 1951 and published 7 September 1953, \"The Silver Chair\" is the first Narnia book not involving the Pevensie children, focusing instead on Eustace. Several months after \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\", Aslan calls Eustace back to Narnia along with his classmate Jill Pole. They are given four signs to aid them in the search for Prince Caspian's son Rilian, who disappeared ten years earlier on a quest to avenge his mother's death. Fifty years have passed in Narnia since the events from \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\"; Eustace is still a child, but Caspian, barely an adult in the previous book, is now an old man. Eustace and Jill, with the help of Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle, face danger and betrayal on their quest to find Rilian.\n\nBegun in March and completed at the end of July 1950, \"The Horse and His Boy\" was published on 6 September 1954. The story takes place during the reign of the Pevensies in Narnia, an era which begins and ends in the last chapter of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\". The protagonists, a young boy named Shasta and a talking horse named Bree, both begin in bondage in the country of Calormen. By \"chance\", they meet and plan their return to Narnia and freedom. Along the way they meet Aravis and her talking horse Hwin, who are also fleeing to Narnia.\n\nCompleted in February 1954\nand published by Bodley Head in London on 2 May 1955, \"The Magician's Nephew\" serves as a prequel and presents Narnia's origin story: how Aslan created the world and how evil first entered it. Digory Kirke and his friend Polly Plummer stumble into different worlds by experimenting with magic rings made by Digory's uncle. In the dying world of Charn they awaken Queen Jadis, and another world turns out to be the beginnings of the Narnian world (where Jadis later becomes the White Witch). The story is set in 1900, when Digory was a 12-year-old boy. He is a middle-aged professor by the time he hosts the Pevensie children in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" 40 years later.\n\nCompleted in March 1953 and published 4 September 1956, \"The Last Battle\" chronicles the end of the world of Narnia. Jill and Eustace return to save Narnia from the ape Shift, who tricks Puzzle the donkey into impersonating the lion Aslan, thereby precipitating a showdown between the Calormenes and King Tirian. This leads to the end of Narnia as it is known throughout the series, but allows Aslan to lead the characters to the \"true\" Narnia.\n\nFans of the series often have strong opinions over the order in which the books should be read. The issue revolves around the placement of \"The Magician's Nephew\" and \"The Horse and His Boy\" in the series. Both are set significantly earlier in the story of Narnia than their publication order and fall somewhat outside the main story arc connecting the others. The reading order of the other five books is not disputed.\n\nWhen first published, the books were not numbered. The first American publisher, Macmillan, enumerated them according to their original publication order, while some early British editions specified the internal chronological order. When Harper Collins took over the series rights in 1994, they adopted the internal chronological order. To make the case for the internal chronological order, Lewis's stepson, Douglas Gresham, quoted Lewis's 1957 reply to a letter from an American fan who was having an argument with his mother about the order:\n\nIn the 2005 Harper Collins adult editions of the books, the publisher cites this letter to assert Lewis's preference for the numbering they adopted by including this notice on the copyright page:\n\nPaul Ford cites several scholars who have weighed in against this view, and continues, \"most scholars disagree with this decision and find it the least faithful to Lewis's deepest intentions\". Scholars and readers who appreciate the original order believe that Lewis was simply being gracious to his youthful correspondent and that he could have changed the books' order in his lifetime had he so desired. They maintain that much of the magic of Narnia comes from the way the world is gradually presented in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" – that the mysterious wardrobe, as a narrative device, is a much better introduction to Narnia than \"The Magician's Nephew\", where the word \"Narnia\" appears in the first paragraph as something already familiar to the reader. Moreover, they say, it is clear from the texts themselves that \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" was intended to be read first. When Aslan is first mentioned in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", for example, the narrator says that \"None of the children knew who Aslan was, any more than you do\" — which is nonsensical if one has already read \"The Magician's Nephew\". Other similar textual examples are also cited.\n\nDoris Meyer, author of \"C. S. Lewis in Context\" and \"Bareface: A guide to C. S. Lewis\", writes that rearranging the stories chronologically \"lessens the impact of the individual stories\" and \"obscures the literary structures as a whole\". Peter Schakel devotes an entire chapter to this topic in his book \"Imagination and the Arts in C. S. Lewis: Journeying to Narnia and Other Worlds\", and in \"Reading with the Heart: The Way into Narnia\" he writes:\n\nAslan, the Great Lion, is the eponymous lion of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", and his role in Narnia is developed throughout the remaining books. He is also the only character to appear in all seven books. Aslan is a talking lion, the King of Beasts, son of the Emperor-Over-the-Sea. He is a wise, compassionate, magical authority (both temporal and spiritual) who serves as mysterious and benevolent guide to the human children who visit, as well as being the guardian and saviour of Narnia. C. S. Lewis described Aslan as an alternative version of Jesus as the form in which Christ might have appeared in an alternative reality.\n\nThe four Pevensie siblings are the main human protagonists of \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". Varying combinations of some or all of them appear in five of the seven novels. They are introduced in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" (although we do not learn their surname until \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\"), and eventually become Kings and Queens of Narnia reigning as a tetrarchy. Although introduced in the series as children, the siblings grow up into adults while reigning in Narnia. They go back to being children once they get back to their own world, but feature as adults in \"The Horse and His Boy\" during their Narnian reign.\n\nAll four appear in \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" and \"Prince Caspian\"; in the latter, however, Aslan tells Peter and Susan that they will not return, as they are getting too old. Susan, Lucy, and Edmund appear in \"The Horse and His Boy\" – Peter is said to be away fighting giants on the other side of Narnia. Lucy and Edmund appear in \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\", where Aslan tells them, too, that they are getting too old. Peter, Edmund, and Lucy appear as Kings and Queens in Aslan's Country in \"The Last Battle\"; Susan does not. Asked by a child in 1958 if he would please write another book entitled \"Susan of Narnia\" so that the entire Pevensie family would be reunited, C. S. Lewis replied: \"I am so glad you like the Narnian books and it was nice of you to write and tell me. There's no use just asking me to write more. When stories come into my mind I have to write them, and when they don't I can't!...\"\n\nLucy is the youngest of the four Pevensie siblings. Of all the Pevensie children, Lucy is the closest to Aslan, and of all the human characters who visit Narnia, Lucy is perhaps the one who believes in Narnia the most. In \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" she initiates the story by entering Narnia through the wardrobe, and (with Susan) witnesses Aslan's execution and resurrection. She is named Queen Lucy the Valiant. In \"Prince Caspian\" she is the first to see Aslan when he comes to guide them. In \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\", it is Lucy who breaks the spell of invisibility on the Dufflepuds. As an adult in \"The Horse and His Boy\" she helps fight the Calormenes at Anvard. Although a minor character in \"The Last Battle\", much of the closing chapter is seen from her point of view.\n\nEdmund is the second child to enter Narnia in \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\", where he falls under the White Witch's spell from eating the Turkish Delight she gives him. Instantiating that book's Christian theme of betrayal, repentance, and subsequent redemption via blood sacrifice, he betrays his siblings to the White Witch. But he quickly realizes her true nature and her evil intentions, and is redeemed by the sacrifice of Aslan's life. He is named King Edmund the Just. In \"Prince Caspian\" and \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" he supports Lucy; in \"The Horse and His Boy\" he leads the Narnian delegation to Calormen and, later, the Narnian army breaking the siege at Anvard.\n\nIn \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" Susan accompanies Lucy to see Aslan die and rise again. She is named Queen Susan the Gentle. In \"Prince Caspian\", however, she is the last of the four to believe and follow Lucy when the latter is called by Aslan to guide them. As an adult queen in \"The Horse and His Boy\" she is courted by Prince Rabadash of Calormen but refuses his marriage proposal, and his angry response leads the story to its climax. In \"The Last Battle\", we are told that she has stopped believing in Narnia and remembers it only as a childhood game.\n\nPeter is the eldest of the Pevensies. In \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" he kills a Talking Wolf to save Susan, and leads the Narnian army against the White Witch. Aslan names him High King, and he is known as Peter the Magnificent. In \"Prince Caspian\" he duels the usurper King Miraz to restore Caspian's throne. In \"The Last Battle\" it is Peter whom Aslan entrusts with the duty of closing the door on Narnia for the final time.\n\nEustace Clarence Scrubb is a cousin of the Pevensies, and a classmate of Jill Pole at their school Experiment House. He is portrayed at first as a brat and a bully, but comes to improve his nasty behaviour when his greed turns him into a dragon for a while. His distress at having to live as a dragon causes him to reflect upon how horrible he has been, and his subsequent improved character is rewarded when Aslan changes him back into a boy. In the later books, Eustace comes across as a much nicer person, although he is still rather grumpy and argumentative. Nonetheless, he becomes a hero along with Jill Pole when the pair succeed in freeing the lost Prince Rilian from the clutches of an evil witch. He appears in \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\", \"The Silver Chair\", and \"The Last Battle.\"\n\nJill Pole is not related to any of the other children who enter Narnia. She is a classmate and neighbour of Eustace Scrubb. She appears in \"The Silver Chair\", where she is the viewpoint character for most of the action, and returns in \"The Last Battle\". In \"The Silver Chair\" Eustace introduces her to the Narnian world, where Aslan gives her the task of memorising a series of signs that will help her and Eustace on their quest to find Caspian's lost son. In \"The Last Battle\" she and Eustace accompany King Tirian in his ill-fated defence of Narnia against the Calormenes.\n\nDigory Kirke is the character referred to in the title of \"The Magician's Nephew\". He first appears as a minor character in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", known only as \"The Professor\", who hosts the Pevensie children when they are evacuated from London and defends Lucy's story of having found a country in the back of the wardrobe. In \"The Magician's Nephew\" the young Digory, thanks to his uncle's magical experimentation, inadvertently brings Jadis from her dying homeworld of Charn to the newly-created world of Narnia; to fix his mistake Aslan sends him to fetch a magical apple which will protect Narnia and heal his dying mother. He returns in \"The Last Battle\".\n\nPolly Plummer appears in \"The Magician's Nephew\" and \"The Last Battle\". She is the next-door neighbour of the young Digory Kirke. She is tricked by a wicked magician (who is Digory's uncle) into touching a magic ring which transports her to the Wood between the Worlds and leaves her there stranded. The wicked uncle persuades Digory to follow her with a second magic ring that has the power to bring her back. This sets up the pair's adventures into other worlds, and they witness the creation of Narnia as described in \"The Magician's Nephew\".\n\nTumnus, called \"Mr Tumnus\" by Lucy, is a faun who is featured prominently in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" and also appears in \"The Horse and His Boy\" and \"The Last Battle\". He is the first creature Lucy meets in Narnia, as well as the first Narnian to be introduced in the series; he invites her to his home with the intention of betraying her to Jadis, but quickly repents and befriends her. In \"The Horse and His Boy\" he devises the Narnian delegation's plan of escape from Calormen. He returns for a brief dialogue at the end of \"The Last Battle\". Tumnus is the faun in the snowy wood: the mental image of which, according to Lewis, was the initial inspiration for the entire Narnia series.\n\nPrince Caspian, later to become King Caspian X of Narnia, Lord of Cair Paravel and Emperor of The Lone Islands – also called \"Caspian the Seafarer\" and \"Caspian the Navigator\" — is the title character of the second book in the series, first introduced as the young nephew and heir of King Miraz of Narnia. \"Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia\" is set 1300 years after the rule of High King Peter and his siblings, when Old Narnians have been driven into hiding by Caspian's ancestors the Telmarines. Caspian is also a central character in \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\", and appears briefly at the beginning and end of \"The Silver Chair\".\n\nTrumpkin the Dwarf is the narrator of several chapters of \"Prince Caspian\"; he is one of Caspian's rescuers and a leading figure in the \"Old Narnian\" rebellion, and accompanies the Pevensie children from the ruins of Cair Paravel to the Old Narnian camp. In \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" we learn that Caspian has made him his Regent in Narnia while he is away at sea, and he appears briefly in this role (now elderly and very deaf) in \"The Silver Chair\".\n\nReepicheep the Mouse is the leader of the Talking Mice of Narnia in \"Prince Caspian\". Utterly fearless, infallibly courteous, and obsessed with honour, he is badly wounded in the final battle but healed by Lucy and Aslan. In \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" his role is greatly expanded; he becomes a visionary as well as a warrior, and ultimately his willing self-exile to Aslan's Country breaks the enchantment on the last three of the Lost Lords, thus achieving the final goal of the quest. Lewis identified Reepicheep as \"specially\" exemplifying the latter book's theme of \"the spiritual life\".\n\nPuddleglum the Marsh-wiggle guides Eustace and Jill on their quest in \"The Silver Chair\". Though always comically pessimistic, he provides the voice of reason and as such intervenes critically in the climactic enchantment scene.\n\nShasta, later known as Cor of Archenland, is the principal character in \"The Horse and His Boy\". Born the eldest son and heir of King Lune of Archenland, and elder twin of Prince Corin, Cor was kidnapped as an infant and raised as a fisherman's son in the country of Calormen. Learning that he is about to be sold into slavery at the beginning of \"The Horse and His Boy\", Shasta escapes to freedom, saves Archenland and Narnia from invasion, learns of his true identity, and is restored to his heritage. Shasta grows up to become King of Archenland, marries the Calormene Tarkheena Aravis, and fathers the next (and most famous) king of Archenland, Ram the Great.\n\nAravis, daughter of Kidrash Tarkaan, is a character in \"The Horse and His Boy\". Escaping a forced betrothal to the loathsome Ahoshta, she joins Shasta on his journey and inadvertently overhears a plot by Rabadash, crown prince of Calormen, to invade Archenland. She later marries Shasta, now known as Prince Cor, and becomes queen of Archenland at his side.\n\nBree (Breehy-hinny-brinny-hoohy-hah) is Shasta's mount and mentor in \"The Horse and His Boy\". A Talking Horse of Narnia, he wandered into Calormen as a foal and was captured. He first appears as a Calormene nobleman's war-horse; when the nobleman buys Shasta as a slave, Bree organises and carries out their joint escape. Though friendly, he is also vain and a braggart until his encounter with Aslan late in the story.\n\nThe last King of Narnia is the viewpoint character for much of \"The Last Battle\". Having rashly killed a Calormene for mistreating a Narnian Talking Horse, he is imprisoned by the villainous ape Shift but released by Eustace and Jill. Together they fight faithfully to the last and are welcomed into Aslan's Kingdom.\n\nJadis, commonly known during her rule of Narnia as the White Witch, is the main villain of \"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\" and \"The Magician's Nephew\" – the only antagonist to appear in more than one Narnia book. In \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\", she is the witch responsible for the freezing of Narnia resulting in the Hundred Year Winter; she turns her enemies into statues and kills Aslan on the Stone Table, but is killed by him in battle after his resurrection. In \"The Magician's Nephew\" she is wakened from a magical sleep by Digory in the dead world of Charn and inadvertently brought to Victorian London before being transported to Narnia, where she steals an apple to grant her the gift of immortality.\n\nKing Miraz is the lead villain of \"Prince Caspian\". Prior to the book's opening he has killed King Caspian IX, father of the titular Prince Caspian, and usurped his throne as king of the Telmarine colonizers in Narnia. He raises Caspian as his heir, but seeks to kill him after his own son is born. As the story progresses he leads the Telmarine war against the Old Narnian rebellion; he is defeated in single combat by Peter and then murdered by one of his own lords.\n\nThe Lady of the Green Kirtle is the lead villain of \"The Silver Chair\", and is also referred to in that book as \"the Queen of Underland\" or simply as \"the Witch\". She rules an underground kingdom through magical mind-control. Prior to the events of \"The Silver Chair\" she has murdered Caspian's Queen and then seduced and abducted his son Prince Rilian. She encounters the protagonists on their quest and sends them astray. Confronted by them later, she attempts to enslave them magically; when that fails, she attacks them in the form of a serpent and is killed.\n\nPrince Rabadash, heir to the throne of Calormen, is the primary antagonist of \"The Horse and His Boy\". Hot-headed, arrogant, and entitled, he brings Susan Pevensie, with a small retinue including Edmund Pevensie, to Calormen in the hope of marrying her. When the Narnians escape his clutches, he attacks Archenland with the intention of establishing a base from which to raid Narnia and take Susan back, but his plan is foiled by Shasta and Aravis warning the Archenlanders. He is captured by Edmund and transformed into a donkey by Aslan as a punishment.\n\nShift is the most prominent villain of \"The Last Battle\". He is an elderly TalkingApe – Lewis does not specify what kind of ape, but Pauline Baynes' illustrations depict him as a chimpanzee. He persuades the naïve donkey Puzzle to pretend to be Aslan (wearing a lion-skin) in order to seize control of Narnia, and proceeds to cut down the forests, enslave the other Talking Beasts, and invite the Calormenes to invade. He loses control of the situation due to over-indulging in alcohol, and is eventually swallowed up by the evil Calormene god Tash.\n\n\nThe main setting of \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" is the world of Narnia constructed by Lewis and, in \"The Magician's Nephew\", the world containing the city of Charn. The Narnian and Charnian worlds are themselves posited as just two in a multiverse of countless worlds that includes our own universe, the main protagonists' world of origin. Passage between these worlds is possible, though rare, and may be accomplished by various means. Narnia itself is described as populated by a wide variety of creatures, most of which would be recognisable to those familiar with European mythologies and British and Irish fairy tales.\n\nLewis's stories are populated with two distinct types of character: Humans originating from the reader's world of Earth, and Narnian creatures and their descendants created by Aslan. This is typical of works that involve parallel universes. The majority of characters from the reader's world serve as the protagonists of the various books, although some are only mentioned in passing depending on chronology. Lewis does not limit himself to a single source of inspiration; instead, he borrows from many sources,including ancient Greek and German mythology, as well as Celtic literature. \n\n\"The Chronicles of Narnia\" describes the world in which Narnia exists as one major landmass encircled by an ocean. Narnia's capital sits on the eastern edge of the landmass on the shores of the Great Eastern Ocean. This ocean contains the islands explored in \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\". On the main landmass Lewis places the countries of Narnia, Archenland, Calormen, and Telmar, along with a variety of other areas that are not described as countries. The author also provides glimpses of more fantastic locations that exist in and around the main world of Narnia, including an edge and an underworld.\n\nThere are several maps of the Narnian universe available, including what many consider the \"official\" one, a full-colour version published in 1972 by the books' illustrator, Pauline Baynes. This is currently out of print, although smaller copies can be found in the most recent HarperCollins 2006 hardcover edition of \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". Two other maps were produced as a result of the popularity of the 2005 film \"\". One, the \"Rose Map of Narnia\", is based loosely on Baynes' map and has Narnian trivia printed on the reverse. The other, made in a monochromatic, archaic style reminiscent of maps of Tolkien's Middle-earth, is available in print and in an interactive version on the DVD of the movie. The latter map depicts only the country Narnia and not the rest of Lewis's world.\n\nA recurring plot device in \"The Chronicles\" is the interaction between the various worlds that make up the Narnian multiverse. A variety of methods are used to initiate these cross-overs which generally serve to introduce characters to the land of Narnia. The Cosmology of Narnia is not as internally consistent as that of Lewis's contemporary Tolkien's Middle-earth, but suffices given the more fairy tale atmosphere of the work. During the course of the series we learn in passing, that the world of Narnia is flat and geocentric and has different stars from those of Earth, and that the passage of time does not correspond directly to the passage of time in our world.\n\n\"The Chronicles\" cover the entire history of the world of Narnia, describing the process by which it was created, offering snapshots of life in Narnia as its history unfolds, and how it is ultimately destroyed. As is often the case in a children's series, children themselves, usually from our world, play a prominent role in all of these events. The history of Narnia is generally divided into the following periods: creation and the period shortly afterwards, the rule of the White Witch, the Golden Age, the invasion and rule of the Telmarines, their subsequent defeat by Caspian X, the rule of King Caspian and his descendants, and the destruction of Narnia. Like many stories, the narrative is not necessarily always presented in chronological order.\n\nLewis's early life has parallels with \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". At the age of seven, he moved with his family to a large house on the edge of Belfast. Its long hallways and empty rooms inspired Lewis and his brother to invent make-believe worlds whilst exploring their home, an activity reflected in Lucy's discovery of Narnia in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\". Like Caspian and Rilian, Lewis lost his mother at an early age, spending much of his youth in English boarding schools similar to those attended by the Pevensie children, Eustace Scrubb, and Jill Pole. During World War II many children were evacuated from London and other urban areas because of German air raids. Some of these children, including one named Lucy (Lewis's goddaughter) stayed with him at his home The Kilns near Oxford, just as the Pevensies stayed with The Professor in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\".\n\nDrew Trotter, president of the Center for Christian Study, noted that the producers of the film \"\" felt that the books' plots adhere to the archetypal \"monomyth\" pattern as detailed in Joseph Campbell's \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\".\n\nLewis was widely read in medieval Celtic literature, an influence reflected throughout the books, and most strongly in \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.\" The entire book imitates one of the immrama, a type of traditional Old Irish tale that combines elements of Christianity and Irish mythology to tell the story of a hero's sea journey to the Otherworld. Medieval Ireland also had a tradition of High Kings ruling over lesser kings and queens or princes, as in Narnia. Lewis's term \"Cair,\" as in Cair Paravel, also mirrors \"Caer\", or \"fortress\" in the Welsh language. Reepicheep's small boat is a \"coracle\", a type of vessel traditionally used in the Celtic regions of the British Isles. Some creatures in the book such as the one-footed Dufflepuds reflect elements of Greek, Roman and Medieval mythology while other Narnian creatures are borrowed from Greek and Germanic mythology: for example, centaurs from the former and dwarfs from the latter.\n\nMichael Ward's 2008 book \"Planet Narnia\" proposes that each of the seven books related to one of the seven moving heavenly bodies or \"planets\" known in the Middle Ages according to the Ptolemaic geocentric model of cosmology (a theme to which Lewis returned habitually throughout his work). At that time, each of these heavenly bodies was believed to have certain attributes, and Ward contends that these attributes were deliberately but subtly used by Lewis to furnish elements of the stories of each book:\n\nLewis's interest in the literary symbolism of medieval and Renaissance astrology is more overtly referenced in other works such as his study of medieval cosmology \"The Discarded Image\", and in his early poetry as well as in \"Space Trilogy\". Narnia scholar Paul F. Ford finds Ward's assertion that Lewis intended \"The Chronicles\" to be an embodiment of medieval astrology implausible, though Ford addresses an earlier (2003) version of Ward's thesis (also called \"Planet Narnia\", published in the \"Times Literary Supplement\"). Ford argues that Lewis did not start with a coherent plan for the books, but Ward's book answers this by arguing that the astrological associations grew in the writing:\n\nA quantitative analysis on the imagery in the different books of \"The Chronicles\" gives mixed support to Ward's thesis: \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\", \"The Silver Chair\", \"The Horse and His Boy\", and \"The Magician's Nephew\" do indeed employ concepts associated with, respectively, Sol, Luna, Mercury, and Venus, far more often than chance would predict, but \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\", \"Prince Caspian\", and \"The Last Battle\" fall short of statistical correlation with their proposed planets.\n\nGeorge MacDonald's \"Phantastes\" (1858) influenced the structure and setting of \"The Chronicles\". It was a work that was \" a great balm to the soul\".\n\nPlato was an undeniable influence on Lewis’s writing of \"The Chronicles\". Most clearly, Digory explicitly invokes Plato's name at the end of \"The Last Battle\", to explain how the old version of Narnia is but a shadow of the newly revealed “true” Narnia. Plato’s influence is also apparent in \"The Silver Chair\" when the Queen of the Underland attempts to convince the protagonists that the surface world is not real. She echoes the logic of Plato’s Cave by comparing the sun to a nearby lamp, arguing that reality is only that which is perceived in the immediate physical vicinity.\n\nThe White Witch in \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" shares many features, both of appearance and character, with the villainous Duessa of Edmund Spenser's \"Faerie Queene\", a work Lewis studied in detail. Like Duessa, she falsely styles herself Queen; she leads astray the erring Edmund with false temptations; she turns people into stone as Duessa turns them into trees. Both villains wear opulent robes and deck their conveyances out with bells. In \"The Magician's Nephew\" Jadis takes on echoes of Satan from John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\": she climbs over the wall of the paradisal garden in contempt of the command to enter only by the gate, and proceeds to tempt Digory as Satan tempted Eve, with lies and half-truths. Similarly, the Lady of the Green Kirtle in \"The Silver Chair\" recalls both the snake-woman Errour in \"The Faerie Queene\" and Satan's transformation into a snake in \"Paradise Lost\".\n\nLewis read Edith Nesbit's children's books as a child and was greatly fond of them. He described \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" around the time of its completion as \"a children's book in the tradition of E. Nesbit\". \"The Magician's Nephew\" in particular bears strong resemblances to Nesbit's \"The Story of the Amulet\" (1906). This novel focuses on four children living in London who discover a magic amulet. Their father is away and their mother is ill, as is the case with Digory. They manage to transport the queen of ancient Babylon to London and she is the cause of a riot; likewise, Polly and Digory transport Queen Jadis to London, sparking a very similar incident.\n\nMarsha Daigle-Williamson argues that Dante’s \"Divine Comedy\" had a significant impact on Lewis’s writings. In the Narnia series, she identifies this influence as most apparent in \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" and \"The Silver Chair\". Daigle-Williamson identifies the plot of \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" as a Dantean journey with a parallel structure and similar themes. She likewise draws numerous connections between \"The Silver Chair\" and the events of Dante’s \"Inferno\".\n\nColin Duriez, writing on the shared elements found in both Lewis’s and J. R. R. Tolkien’s works, highlights the thematic similarities between Tolkien’s poem \"Imram\" and Lewis’s \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\".\n\n\"The Chronicles of Narnia\" has been a significant influence on both adult and children's fantasy literature in the post-World War II era. In 1976, the scholar Susan Cornell Poskanzer praised Lewis for his \"strangely powerful fantasies\". Poskanzer argued that children could relate to \"Narnia\" books because the heroes and heroines were realistic characters, each with their own distinctive voice and personality. Furthermore, the protagonists become powerful kings and queens who decide the fate of kingdoms, while the adults in the \"Narnia\" books tended to be buffoons, which by inverting the normal order of things was pleasing to many youngsters. However, Poskanzer criticized Lewis for what she regarded as scenes of gratuitous violence, which she felt were upsetting to children. Poskanzer also noted Lewis presented his Christian message subtly enough as to avoid boring children with overt sermonizing.\n\nExamples include:\n\nPhilip Pullman's fantasy series, \"His Dark Materials\", is seen as a response to \"The Chronicles\". Pullman is a self-described atheist who wholly rejects the spiritual themes that permeate \"The Chronicles\", yet his series nonetheless addresses many of the same issues and introduces some similar character types, including talking animals. In another parallel, the first books in each series – Pullman's \"Northern Lights\" and \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" – both open with a young girl hiding in a wardrobe.\n\nNeil Gaiman's young-adult horror novella \"Coraline\" has been compared to \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\", as both books involve young girls travelling to magical worlds through doors in their new houses and fighting evil with the help of talking animals. His \"Sandman\" comic book series also features a Narnia-like \"dream island\" in its story arc entitled \"A Game of You\". When the island is unmade by its creator Morpheus, the inhabitants march into the shadow of his cloak in a scene visually similar to Aslan's judgement of the inhabitants of Narnia in \"The Last Battle\".\n\nBill Willingham's comic book series \"Fables\" makes reference at least twice to a king called \"The Great Lion\", a thinly veiled reference to Aslan. The series avoids explicitly referring to any characters or works that are not in the public domain.\n\nThe novel \"Bridge to Terabithia\" by Katherine Paterson has Leslie, one of the main characters, reveal to Jesse her love of Lewis's books, subsequently lending him \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" so that he can learn how to behave like a king. Her book also features the island name \"Terabithia\", which sounds similar to Terebinthia, a Narnian island that appears in \"Prince Caspian\" and \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\". Katherine Paterson herself acknowledges that Terabithia is likely to be derived from Terebinthia:\nI thought I had made it up. Then, rereading \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" by C. S. Lewis, I realized that I had probably gotten it from the island of Terebinthia in that book. However, Lewis probably got that name from the Terebinth tree in the Bible, so both of us pinched from somewhere else, probably unconsciously.\"\n\nScience-fiction author Greg Egan's short story \"Oracle\" depicts a parallel universe in which an author nicknamed Jack (Lewis's nickname) has written novels about the fictional \"Kingdom of Nesica\", and whose wife is dying of cancer, paralleling the death of Lewis's wife Joy Davidman. Several Narnian allegories are also used to explore issues of religion and faith versus science and knowledge.\n\nLev Grossman's \"New York Times\" best-seller \"The Magicians\" is a contemporary dark fantasy about an unusually gifted young man obsessed with Fillory, the magical land of his favourite childhood books. Fillory is a thinly veiled substitute for Narnia, and clearly the author expects it to be experienced as such. Not only is the land home to many similar talking animals and mythical creatures, it is also accessed through a grandfather clock in the home of an uncle to whom five English children are sent during World War II. Moreover, the land is ruled by two Aslan-like rams named Ember and Umber, and terrorised by The Watcherwoman. She, like the White Witch, freezes the land in time. The book's plot revolves heavily around a place very like the \"wood between the worlds\" from \"The Magician's Nephew\", an interworld waystation in which pools of water lead to other lands. This reference to \"The Magician's Nephew\" is echoed in the title of the book.\n\nJ. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, has said that she was a fan of the works of Lewis as a child, and cites the influence of \"The Chronicles\" on her work: \"I found myself thinking about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in King's Cross Station — it dissolves and he's on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there's the train for Hogwarts.\" Nevertheless, she is at pains to stress the differences between Narnia and her world: \"Narnia is literally a different world\", she says, \"whereas in the Harry books you go into a world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday worlds. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child. I got so caught up I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal.\" \"New York Times\" writer Charles McGrath notes the similarity between Dudley Dursley, the obnoxious son of Harry's neglectful guardians, and Eustace Scrubb, the spoiled brat who torments the main characters until he is redeemed by Aslan.\n\nAs with any popular long-lived work, contemporary culture abounds with references to the lion Aslan, travelling via wardrobe and direct mentions of \"The Chronicles\". Examples include:\nCharlotte Staples Lewis, a character first seen early in the fourth season of the TV series \"Lost\", is named in reference to C. S. Lewis. \"Lost\" producer Damon Lindelof said that this was a clue to the direction the show would take during the season. The book \"Ultimate Lost and Philosophy\", edited by William Irwin and Sharon Kaye, contains a comprehensive essay on \"Lost\" plot motifs based on \"The Chronicles\".\n\nThe second SNL Digital Short by Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell features a humorous nerdcore hip hop song titled \"Chronicles of Narnia (Lazy Sunday)\", which focuses on the performers' plan to see \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" at a cinema. It was described by \"Slate\" magazine as one of the most culturally significant \"Saturday Night Live\" skits in many years, and an important commentary on the state of rap. Swedish Christian power metal band Narnia, whose songs are mainly about the \"Chronicles of Narnia\" or the Bible, feature Aslan on all their album covers. In anticipation of 9 December 2005 premiere of the film \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", various Christian artists released a based on \"The Chronicles of Narnia\".\n\nDuring interviews, the primary creator of the Japanese anime and gaming series \"Digimon\" has said that he was inspired and influenced by \"The Chronicles of Narnia\".\n\n\"The Roar of Love\" is a 1980 concept album by Christian band 2nd Chapter of Acts based on \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\".\n\nThe song \"Further Up, Further In\" from the album \"Room to Roam\" by The Waterboys is heavily influenced by \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", with the title coming from a passage in \"The Last Battle\". C. S. Lewis is acknowledged in the liner notes as an influence.\n\nA convert to Christianity in later life, Lewis had authored a number of works on Christian apologetics and other literature with Christian-based themes before writing the \"Narnia\" books. The character Aslan is widely accepted by literary academia as being based on Jesus Christ. Lewis did not initially plan to incorporate Christian theological concepts into his \"Narnia\" stories. Lewis maintained that the \"Narnia\" books were not allegorical, preferring to term their Christian aspects a \"supposition\".\n\n\"The Chronicles\" have, consequently, a large Christian following, and are widely used to promote Christian ideas. However, some Christians object that \"The Chronicles\" promote \"soft-sell paganism and occultism\" due to recurring pagan imagery and themes.\n\nIn later years, both Lewis and the \"Chronicles\" have been criticised (often by other authors of fantasy fiction) for gender role stereotyping, though other authors have defended Lewis in this area. For example, Lucy gets a healing potion and a dagger, while Peter gets a sword. Most allegations of sexism centre on the description of Susan Pevensie in \"The Last Battle\" when Lewis writes that Susan is \"no longer a friend of Narnia\" and interested \"in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstick and invitations\".\n\nPhilip Pullman, inimical to Lewis on many fronts, calls the \"Narnia\" stories \"monumentally disparaging of women\". His interpretation of the Susan passages reflects this view:\n\nSusan, like Cinderella, is undergoing a transition from one phase of her life to another. Lewis didn't approve of that. He didn't like women in general, or sexuality at all, at least at the stage in his life when he wrote the Narnia books. He was frightened and appalled at the notion of wanting to grow up.\n\nIn fantasy author Neil Gaiman's short story \"The Problem of Susan\" (2004), an elderly woman, Professor Hastings, deals with the grief and trauma of her entire family's death in a train crash. Although the woman's maiden name is not revealed, details throughout the story strongly imply that this character is the elderly Susan Pevensie. The story is written for an adult audience and deals with issues of sexuality and violence and through it Gaiman presents a critique of Lewis's treatment of Susan.\n\nOther writers, including fan-magazine editor Andrew Rilstone, oppose this view, arguing that the \"lipsticks, nylons and invitations\" quote is taken out of context. They maintain that in \"The Last Battle\", Susan is excluded from Narnia explicitly because she no longer believes in it. At the end of \"The Last Battle\" Susan is still alive with her ultimate fate unspecified. Moreover, in \"The Horse and His Boy\", Susan's adulthood and sexual maturity are portrayed in a positive light, and therefore argued to be unlikely reasons for her exclusion from Narnia.\n\nLewis supporters also cite the positive roles of women in the series, including Jill Pole in \"The Silver Chair\", Aravis Tarkheena in \"The Horse and His Boy\", Polly Plummer in \"The Magician's Nephew,\" and particularly Lucy Pevensie in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\". Alan Jacobs, an English professor at Wheaton College, asserts that Lucy is the most admirable of the human characters and that generally the girls come off better than the boys throughout the series (Jacobs, 2008: 259). In her contribution to \"The Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy\", Karin Fry, an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point, notes that \"the most sympathetic female characters in \"The Chronicles\" are consistently the ones who question the traditional roles of women and prove their worth to Aslan through actively engaging in the adventures just like the boys.\" Fry goes on to say:\n\nThe characters have positive and negative things to say about both male and female characters, suggesting an equality between sexes. However, the problem is that many of the positive qualities of the female characters seem to be those by which they can rise above their femininity ... The superficial nature of stereotypical female interests is condemned.\n\nTaking a different stance altogether, Monika B. Hilder provides a thorough examination of the feminine ethos apparent in each book of the series, and proposes that critics tend to misread Lewis’s representation of gender. As she puts it “...we assume that Lewis is sexist when he is in fact applauding the “feminine” heroic. To the extent that we have not examined our own chauvinism, we demean the “feminine” qualities and extol the “masculine” - not noticing that Lewis does the opposite.”\n\nIn addition to sexism, Pullman and others have also accused the Narnia series of fostering racism. Over the alleged racism in \"The Horse and His Boy\", newspaper editor Kyrie O'Connor wrote:\n\nIt's just too dreadful. While the book's storytelling virtues are enormous, you don't have to be a bluestocking of political correctness to find some of this fantasy anti-Arab, or anti-Eastern, or anti-Ottoman. With all its stereotypes, mostly played for belly laughs, there are moments you'd like to stuff this story back into its closet.\n\nGregg Easterbrook, writing in \"The Atlantic\", calls the Calormenes \"standins for Muslims\", while novelist Philip Hensher raises specific concerns that a reader might gain the impression Islam is a \"Satanic cult\". In rebuttal to this charge, at an address to a C. S. Lewis conference, Dr. Devin Brown argued that there are too many dissimilarities between the Calormene religion and Islam, particularly in the areas of polytheism and human sacrifice, for Lewis's writing to be regarded as critical of Islam.\n\nNicholas Wanberg has argued, echoing claims by Mervyn Nicholson, that accusations of racism in the books are \"an oversimplification\", but he asserts that the stories employ beliefs about human aesthetics, including equating dark skin with ugliness, that have been traditionally associated with racist thought.\n\nCritics also argue whether Lewis's work presents a positive or negative view of colonialism. Nicole DuPlessis favors the anticolonial view, claiming \"the negative effects of colonial exploitations and the themes of animals' rights and responsibility to the environment are emphasized in Lewis' construction of a community of living things. Through the negative examples of illegitimate rulers, Lewis constructs the 'correct' relationship between humans and nature, providing examples of rulers like Caspian who fulfill their responsibilities to the environment.\" Clare Etcherling counters with her claim that \"those 'illegitimate' rulers are often very dark-skinned\" and that the only \"legitimate rulers are those sons and daughters of Adam and Eve who adhere to Christian conceptions of morality and stewardship – either white English children (such as Peter) or Narnians who possess characteristics valued and cultivated by the British (such as Caspian).\"\n\nVarious books from \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" have been adapted for television over the years, including:\n\n\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" was first adapted in 1967. Comprising ten episodes of thirty minutes each, the screenplay was written by Trevor Preston, and directed by Helen Standage. Unlike subsequent adaptations, it is currently unavailable to purchase for home viewing. The book was adapted again in 1979, this time as an animated cartoon co-produced by Bill Meléndez and the Children's Television Workshop, with a screenplay by David D. Connell. Winner of the 1979 Emmy award for Outstanding Animated Program, it was one of the first major made-for-television feature-length animated films. Many of the characters' voices in the British TV release were re-recorded by British actors with the exception of the characters Aslan, Peter, Susan, and Lucy.\n\nBetween 1988 and 1990, the first four books (as published) were adapted by the BBC as four television serials. They were also aired in America on the PBS/Disney show WonderWorks. They were nominated for a total of 14 Emmy awards, including \"Outstanding Children's Program\", and a number of BAFTA awards including Best Children's Programme (Entertainment / Drama) in 1988, 1989 and 1990. The serials were later edited into three feature-length films (the second of which combined \"Prince Caspian\" and \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" into one) and released on VHS and DVD.\n\nOn 3 October 2018, the C.S. Lewis Company announced that Netflix had acquired the rights to new film and series adaptations of the Narnia books. According to \"Fortune\", this was the first time that rights to the entire \"Narnia\" catalogue had been held by a single company. Entertainment One, which had acquired production rights to a fourth \"Narnia\" film, also joined the series. Mark Gordon, Douglas Gresham and Vincent Sieber will serve as executive producers.\n\nA critically acclaimed BBC Radio 4 dramatisation was produced in the 1980s, starring Maurice Denham as Professor Kirke. Collectively titled \"Tales of Narnia\", the programs covered the entire series with a running time of approximately 15 hours. In Great Britain, BBC Audiobooks release both audio cassette and compact disc versions of the series.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2002 Focus on the Family produced radio dramatisations of the entire series through its Radio Theatre program. Over one hundred performers took part including Paul Scofield as the storyteller and David Suchet as Aslan. Accompanied by an original orchestral score and cinema-quality digital sound design, the series was hosted by Lewis's stepson Douglas Gresham and ran for just over 22 hours. Recordings of the entire adaptation were released on compact disc between 1999–2003.\n\nMany stage adaptations of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" have been produced over the years.\n\nIn 1984, Vanessa Ford Productions presented \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" at London's Westminster Theatre. Adapted by Glyn Robbins, the play was directed by Richard Williams and designed by Marty Flood. The production was later revived at Westminster and The Royalty Theatre and went on tour until 1997. Productions of other tales from \"The Chronicles\" were also staged, including \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" (1986), \"The Magician's Nephew\" (1988) and \"The Horse and His Boy\" (1990).\n\nIn 1997, Trumpets Inc., a Filipino Christian theatre and musical production company, produced a musical rendition of \"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\" that Douglas Gresham, Lewis's stepson (and co-producer of the Walden Media film adaptations), has openly declared that he feels is the closest to Lewis's intent. The book and lyrics were written by Jaime del Mundo and Luna Inocian, while the music was composed by Lito Villareal.\n\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company premiered \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1998. The novel was adapted as a musical production by Adrian Mitchell, with music by Shaun Davey. The show was originally directed by Adrian Noble and designed by Anthony Ward, with the revival directed by Lucy Pitman-Wallace. Well received by audiences, the production was periodically re-staged by the RSC for several years afterwards. Limited engagements were subsequently undertaken at the Barbican Theatre in London and at Sadler's Wells. This adaptation also toured the United States in the early 2000s.\n\nSceptical that any cinematic adaptation could render the more fantastical elements and characters of the story realistically, Lewis never sold the film rights to the \"Narnia\" series. In answering a letter with a question posed by a child in 1957, asking if the Narnia series could please be on television, C. S. Lewis wrote back: \"They'd be no good on TV. Humanized beasts can't be presented to the \"eye\" without at once becoming either hideous or ridiculous. I wish the idiots who run the film world [would] realize that there are stories [which] are for the \"ear\" alone.\" Only after seeing a demo reel of CGI animals did Douglas Gresham, Lewis's stepson and literary executor, and the films' co-producer, give approval for a film adaptation.\n\nThe first novel adapted was \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" as \"\" released in December 2005. Produced by Walden Media and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures, the film was directed by Andrew Adamson, with a screenplay by Ann Peacock, Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus. The movie was a critical and box-office success, grossing over $745 million worldwide. Disney and Walden Media then co-produced a sequel \"\", released in May 2008, which grossed over $419 million worldwide.\n\nIn December 2008 Disney pulled out of financing the remainder of the \"Chronicles of Narnia\" film series. Already in pre-production at the time, 20th Century Fox and Walden Media eventually co-produced \"\", which was released in December 2010 going on to gross over $415 million worldwide.\n\nIn May 2012, producer Douglas Gresham confirmed that Walden Media's contract with the C.S. Lewis Estate had expired, and that there was a moratorium on producing any \"Narnia\" films outside of Walden Media. On 1 October 2013, it was announced that the C.S. Lewis Company had entered into an agreement with the Mark Gordon Company to jointly develop and produce \"\". On 26 April 2017, Joe Johnston was hired to direct the film. In October, Johnston said filming is expected to begin in late 2018.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4990224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4990224", "title": "Wongaksa Pagoda", "text": "Wongaksa Pagoda\n\nWongaksa Pagoda is a twelve metre high ten storey marble pagoda in the center of Seoul, South Korea. It was constructed in 1467 to form part of Wongaksa temple, that King Sejo had founded two years before on the site of an older Goryeo-period temple, Heungbok-sa. The temple was closed and turned into a kisaeng house by the (later deposed) king known as Yeonsan-gun (1476 – 1506, r. 1494-1506), and under his successor, King Jungjong (1488 – 1544, r.1506–1544) the site was turned into government offices. The pagoda and a memorial stele commemorating the foundation of Wongaksa alone survived. The site of the temple was later occupied by houses. During the Imjin War of the 1590s, the top portion of the pagoda was pulled down and lay on the ground at the foot of the pagoda until it was replaced by American military engineers in 1947.\n\nForeign visitors to Seoul in the late 19th century often went to admire the beautiful pagoda but it was almost inaccessible, hidden in the courtyard of a small house, and in 1897 John McLeavy Brown, the Irish financial advisor to King Gojong, was authorized by the king to turn the area into Seoul's first public park. He called it Pagoda Park, the name it had at the time of the 1919 March 1st Movement. Today the park is known as Tapgol (Pagoda) Park () and the pagoda stands in a protective glass case. The Korean name literally means \"ten storeyed stone pagoda of Wongaksa Temple site.\" \n\nThe pagoda is considered by art historians to be one of the finest examples of Joseon dynasty pagoda art. The pagoda was designated as the second national treasure of Korea on December 12, 1962. From an inscription on the upper part of the pagoda it is known that the pagoda was built in 1467, the thirteenth year of King Sejo's reign.\n\nIt is one of the few pagodas made from marble in Korea. Typical Korean pagodas are made from granite, a material abundant on the peninsula. The pedestal supporting the pagoda is three-tiered, and its shape seen from the top looks like a Chinese character, 亞. The first three storeys of the pagoda follow the shape of the base and the next seven storeys are shaped in form of squares. Dragons, lions, lotus flowers, phoenixes, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and the Four Heavenly Kings carved on each storey of the pagoda. The pagoda, while made of stone, is carved to look as if it was made from wood. The pagoda has brackets, pillars, and curved roof shapes that imitate a wooden pagoda design.\n\nThe pagoda was clearly modelled on the beautiful Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda, which was made during the Goryeo Era. Originally erected in 1348 at Gyeongcheon-sa temple on Mt. Busosan in Gwangdeok-myeon, Gaepung-gun, Gyeonggi-do (near Gaesong, now in North Korea), it was taken to Japan in 1907, returned to Korea in 1918, and is now housed at the National Museum of Korea.\n\nThe first detailed description of the pagoda in English, together with a translation of the inscription on the stele, was published in 1915 by the scholarly missionary James Scarth Gale in the Royal Asiatic Society Korea Branch's \"Transactions\" Vol. VI, part II:1-22 “The Pagoda of Seoul.”\n\n\n"}
