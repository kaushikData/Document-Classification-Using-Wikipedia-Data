The Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) has suggested the alternative term \"aspin\", short for \"asong Pinoy\" (Pinoy dog) probably to avoid the stigma associated with the term \"askal\". In Cebuano, mongrel dogs are called irong Bisaya, which literally means \"Visayan dog\" or \"native dog\" (note that the word \"Bisaya\" doesn't explicitly mean \"Visayan\" but it is a term pertaining people and animals native to a specific locale. For example, \"manok bisaya\" simply means a breed of chicken native to a locality), implying that these are not thought of as a mixed-breed dog so much as unbred mongrels with no purebred ancestors. This is only from a Bisayan point of view since Irong Bisaya don't differ in character or physical appearance from the other Askals found in the entire Philippine archipelago. Physically, the dogs have \"all shapes, configurations and sizes.\"\n\nFemales' height usually ranges from 12-16 inches while Males can be between 14-19 inches. The coat can be short haired or rough. Coat colors ranges from Black, Brown, Brindle, Gray, Cream and White. Spots are commonly found at the base of the tail and at the back in semi circular fashion. The snout sometimes appears black if the coat color is brown. The tail is usually held high and the ears can be floppy, semi-floppy or fully pointing upwards. The bone structure of a native Askal is on the medium range, never heavy like in Rottweilers.\n\nIn an opinion piece for the Inquirer, Michael Tan writes that Askals are often more resilient and street-smart than purebreds.PAWS reports that at one point, 98% of the calls it received about cruelty and abuse involved askals.\n\nAskals have been raised traditionally as guard dogs of the home and farm. They are naturally suspicious of strangers, independent and protective of family members. They are also good to very young children as companions due to their devotion to family members. They are usually trusted by their Filipino owners to roam around town markets or the neighborhood to socialize with other dogs which is why these dogs are seen by the Western people as stray dogs when, in fact, they are not. They are, however, expected to be home before dusk especially the males who would always be looking for females in heat. Female dogs usually stay home and are excellent watch dogs. Aspins were allowed to compete in the First Philippine Dog Agility Championships in 2013. At the 2015 Pet Express Doggie Run in Pasay City, aspins were the featured type of dog. The dogs featured in an essay by Gilda Cordero-Fernando. Aspins have been trained by the Coast Guard to identify bombs and drugs by scent.\n\n\n"}

RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., 327 U.S. 251 (1946), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court allowing an action to recover compensatory damages under the antitrust statutes. The jury had returned a verdict for $120,000 in petitioner's favor, covering a five-year period where plaintiff suffered due to respondents' antitrust conspiracy. The trial court, sitting in the Northern District of Illinois, gave judgment for treble damages, as prescribed by § 4 of the Clayton Act. The 7th Circuit reversed on the sole ground that the evidence of damage was not sufficient for submission to the jury, and directed the entry of judgment for respondents \"non obstante veredicto\" (notwithstanding the verdict). The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine whether the evidence of damage was sufficient to support the verdict. Respondents argued that any measure of damages would be too speculative and uncertain to afford an accurate measure of the amount of the damage. The Supreme Court disagreed, not wanting to let the respondent defeat a remedy because its antitrust violation was so effective and complete. The Court held that the jury could return a verdict for the plaintiffs, even though damages could not be measured with the exactness which would otherwise have been possible, so long as the jury made a \"just and reasonable estimate of the damage based on relevant data\". The judgment of the district court was affirmed and the judgment of the court of appeals was reversed.\n\nPetitioners, owners of the Jackson Park motion picture theatre in Chicago, alleged that respondents, some of whom, like RKO Pictures, were distributors of films, and some of whom owned or controlled theatres in Chicago, entered into a conspiracy which continued from some time before November 1936 to the date the suit was brought, July 28, 1942. During the conspiracy, films were distributed among cinemas in Chicago in such a manner that theatres owned by some of the conspirators were able to show movies before independent theater operators. Independent exhibitors were not able to show new movies until the conspirators had finished with a \"first run\".\n\nThe first question was whether there was an unlawful conspiracy, and the second question was how to measure the damages for any loss, given the difficulty of knowing how many people might have attended different films.\n\nThe Supreme Court found that it was \"indisputable that the jury could have found that ... a first run theater possessed competitive advantages over later run theaters\" and that this discriminatory release was \"damaging to petitioners\". The problem, however, was the uncertainty in determining to what amount those damages should total. The petitioners submitted two methodologies for calculating damages. The first was the yardstick method, which compared the earnings from petitioner's theater, Jackson Park, during the conspiracy to the earnings of its competitor, the Maryland Theater. The two theaters were comparable in size, although the Jackson Park theater was \"superior in location, equipment, and attractiveness to patrons.\" The Maryland Theater, however, was owned by Paramount Pictures, and benefited from the conspiracy. The evidence showed that during the five-year period, Maryland's profit exceeded petitioner's like profit by $115,982.34.\n\nThe second measure was the before & after method. Here, the Court looked to the years 1933-1937, where the petitioner had successfully showed at least some first run movies, to the five-year period where the conspiracy was established to have happened, and petitioner was completely shut out of first run movies despite its best efforts. This comparison showed a falling off of petitioners' profits during the five-year period aggregating $125,659.00.\n\nThe 7th Circuit concluded that the jury had adopted the before & after method, but that this proof did not furnish a proper measure of damage for the reason that it could not be proved what petitioner's earnings would have been in the absence of the illegal distribution of films. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that a damage award does not need to be mathematically precise, but it must be a just and reasonable estimate based on the evidence presented, and not based on speculation. Petitioners are able to submit yardstick or before & after estimates, but they must be careful to use comparable data.\n\n"}

He said \"[i]n terms of the frequency of slang use, the present research findings suggest that females are by no means passive slang users nowadays. Therefore the traditional belief that males are slang dominators and females slang eschewers... does not hold true at present time any longer.\"\n\n\"Triad language\" is a type of Cantonese slang. It is censored out of television and films, and triad language. Kingsley Bolton and Christopher Hutton, the authors of \"Bad Boys and Bad Language: Chòu háu and the Sociolinguistics of Swear Words in Cantonese,\" said that regardless of official discouragement of the use of triad language, \"[T]riad language or triad-associated language is an important source of innovation in Hong Kong Cantonese.\"\n\n\"Chòu háu\" (粗口, Jyutping: cou1 hau2, Mandarin Pinyin: \"Cūkǒu\", Lit: Coarse Mouth) refers to sexually explicit taboo words. In Hong Kong print media, feature fils, and television, such words are censored. Bolton and Hutton said \"[t]he use of \"chòu háu\" is often seen as a marker of criminality of triad-membership, and official agencies tend to view the spread of \"chòu háu\" into the mainstream of Hong Kong society and its media as indicating a general crisis, as being symptomatic of a rising tide of social disorder and alienation.\"\n\nTwo way of talking in Cantonese slang is \"Moh lei tau.\" Chow Sing Chi, a comedy actor, started the slang in the 1990s. \"Moh lei tau\" became popular with younger people and secondary school students, and the groups began to use it. The slang made Chow well-known and financially prosperous. Some prominent members of Hong Kong society believed that the slang was lowering the quality of the language and asked youth to stop using it. Sue Wright, author of \"One Country, Two Systems, Three Languages: A Survey of Changing Language Use in Hong Kong\", said in 1997 that \"The rage is over now; the role of television in starting it remains indisputable.\"\n\nThe authorities in Hong Kong monitor film and television for slang, removing what is considered to be inappropriate. Kingsley Bolton and Christopher Hutton, the authors of \"Bad Boys and Bad Language: Chòu háu and the Sociolinguistics of Swear Words in Cantonese,\" said that Hong Kong authorities have far less tolerance of vulgar words than in western societies such as the United Kingdom and that aspect is \"seems to distinguish the situation\" in Hong Kong.\n\nThere are a lot of slang terms in Hong Kong, for example there are terms for members of minority groups include \"鬼佬gweilo,\" (ghost man) refers to White people (mainly US and UK) because of the eye, hair and skin color differences, \"ga tau\", \"ga jai\", and \"蘿白頭 lo baat tau\" (radish head) meaning Japanese people, \"bak gwei\" (white ghost) meaning Caucasians, \"黑鬼 hak gwei\" (black ghost) refers to Black people while the \"ghost\" part is inherited from \"鬼佬gweilo\" (ghost man) in a sense meaning foreigners, \"bun mui/jai\" meaning Filipina/Filipino domestic employees, and \"阿差ah cha\" or \"阿星 ah sing\" meaning Indian people and Pakistani people.\n\nLinda Chiu-han Lai, author of \"Film and Enigmatization,\" said that \"The power of Cantonese slang is instantaneously differentiating at the moment of utterance: it distinguishes not only Cantonese from Mandarin speakers, but also Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong from those who live in places like Singapore, Malaysia, Canton, Canada, and so on—part of the Cantonese diaspora.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The Taiwanese cat café eventually became a tourist destination, attracting tourists from Japan as well as all over the globe. Although the origin of cat café is in Taiwan, the concept blossomed in Japan, where the first one named \"Neko no Jikan\" (lit. \"Cat's Time\") was opened in Osaka in 2004. Due to the Japan's land size and population, many residents live in small apartments or condominiums which do not allow pets, making a cat café a very popular destination for young workers looking for the companionship and comfort offered. Tokyo's first cat café, named \"Neko no mise\" (Shop of Cats), opened in 2005. After this, the popularity of cat cafés boomed in Japan. From 2005 to 2010, seventy-nine cat cafés opened across the country.\n\nIn the United Kingdom animal charities disagree on whether cat cafés are a suitable environment for cats with the RSPCA, Cats Protection and the Celia Hammond Animal Trust criticizing them for keeping large numbers of cats in a confined space with a revolving population of people. International Cat Care takes a more positive view saying \"It is a difficult environment to get right but it's not impossible by any means\". However, all the charities agree that cat cafés need to be properly regulated.\n\nIndia's first cat café, Cat Café Studio, opened in 2010 in Mumbai.\n\nCat cafés are quite popular in Japan, with Tokyo being home to 58 cat cafés . The first was , by Norimasa Hanada, which opened in 2005. The popularity of cat cafés in Japan is attributed to many apartments forbidding pets, and to cats providing relaxing companionship in what may otherwise be a stressful and lonesome urban life. Other forms of pet rental, such as rabbit cafés, are also common in Japan.\n\nThere are various types of cat cafés in Japan. Some feature specific categories of cat such as black cats, fat cats, rare breed cats or ex-stray cats. Every cat café in Japan is required to obtain a license and comply with the strict requirements and regulations of the nation's Animal Treatment and Protection Law.\n\nJapanese cat cafés feature strict rules to ensure cleanliness and animal welfare, in particular seeking to ensure that the cats are not disturbed by excessive and unwanted attention, such as by young children or when sleeping. Many cat cafés also seek to raise awareness of cat welfare issues, such as abandoned and stray cats and many often have cats from local animal shelters to help them lose any fear of humans and advertise them for possible adoption. From 2012 the cats could be displayed until 8 pm, but in 2016 the guidelines of the environment ministry state that they may visit and play with customers until 10 pm.\n\nOne café in Tokyo added goats as a way of having a unique element.\n\nSouth Korea also has several cat cafés, most in Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. Cat cafés in South Korea have been very successful among both residents and tourists in South Korea. It is quite easy to find a cat café at Seoul these days. Customers can even adopt a cat at the cat cafés if they want. There are also rules that Customers must follow before they hang out with cats like they need to take off their shoes and wash their hands.\n\nThe first cat café in Singapore is Cat Café Neko no Niwa (Japanese for ‘Cat Garden’). As of today, there are at least five cat cafés in the city. The cat cafés are namely Neko no Niwa, The Cat Cafés, The Company of Cats, Meomi Cat Café and Cuddles Cat Café. Neko no Niwa, The Company of Cats and The Cat Café feature cats who were rescued.\n\nThe Singaporean Cat Cafes are regulated and licensed by AVA and they are all bound to a 'code of conduct'. Individuals having questions with their cat needs, can join the Cat Welfare Society, which helps with medical fees, sterilization costs or adopting of the cats. Cat Cafes usually have their own/specific houserules.\n\nCuddles Cat Cafe was investigated by Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) in December 2014.\n\nCats are popular pets in Taiwan, with the cat population increasing rapidly in recent years. The world's first cat café, named \"Cat Flower Garden\", opened in Taipei in 1998, where there is also a luxurious \"Cathy Hotel\" especially for cats.

Catmosphere Cat Cafe and Maewmoth cafés are located in Chiang Mai.\n\nAccording to local legend, the world's first cat café opened in Vienna in the summer of 1912 and ceased operation approximately two years later. It is said that Vladimir Lenin was a regular for a period in 1913, finding the feline companionship a comfort during his time of exile. The cat café is known to have ceased operation shortly after the beginning of the First World War, although the much repeated story that the closure was due to its patriotic owner's donating all the cats to a factory making fur-lined boots for the war effort may be apocryphal. In 2012 cat café Neko was opened in Vienna.\n\nLe Chat Touille opened up in Brussels in 2014. DreamCATchers opened in Ghent in 2017. It takes in cats from shelters, rehabilitates them if necessary with the aid of volunteers and a cat behavioural therapist, to then allow them to be adopted by customers.

In some cases, this even extends to areas that cats pass through only briefly (e.g. an adopted cat must leave through a separate door without passing an area that prepares food).\n\nGaining regulatory approval can be difficult, as with KitTea of San Francisco. Starting the process in November 2013, KitTea's design was finally approved in August 2014 after extensive negotiation with San Francisco's Health Department. Oakland's Cat Town has the distinct honor of being the first cat cafe to open its doors to customers, signing a lease in July 2014 and opening just months later in October.

Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship, prosecution, or other suppression. In academic study, such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications (as opposed to officially sanctioned, orthodox publishing).\n\nExamples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents; the Aljamiado literature of Al-Andalus Spain; and the nushu writing of some upper-class women in Hunan, China, from around the 10th century to the 19th century. Clandestine publications were plentiful during the Enlightenment era in 18th-century France, circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts, usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the Ancien Régime, or even straight out atheist. These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s, and contained such controversial works as \"Treatise of the Three Impostors\" and the reverend Jean Mesliers \"Atheistic Testament\". Both texts were later published in edited versions by Voltaire, but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe. The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France. These books were usually termed \"philosophical works\", but varied greatly in content from pornography, utopian novels, political slander and actual philosophical works by radical enlightenment philosophers like Baron d'Holbach, Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\n\nThe willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons, when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power, but also for reasons at a formal level, when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works. Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs, often being funded by the authors themselves.\n\nWorks that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature, such as \"Das Kapital\" and \"El Buscón\".\n\nA legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad. The Olympia Press in Paris published several 20th-century English-language writers, including Henry Miller, who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time.\n\n"}

Founded in 1925, CGU is a member of the Claremont Colleges which includes five undergraduate (Pomona College, Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College, Scripps College, Pitzer College) and two graduate (CGU and Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences) institutions of higher education. Adjoining and within walking distance of one another, design was based on that of Oxford University and Cambridge University.\n\nCGU is the oldest all-graduate institution in the United States, with many notable alumni in different fields all over the world. The university is organized into five separate schools: the School of Arts & Humanities; School of Community & Global Health; Drucker School of Management; School of Educational Studies; and the School of Social Science, Policy, & Evaluation.\n\nFounded in 1925, CGU was the second of the Claremont Colleges to form, following Pomona College and preceding Scripps College. Claremont Graduate University is the oldest remaining all-graduate university in the United States. The school has undergone several name changes since its inception. After being called Claremont University College for thirty-seven years, in 1962 the school officially became known as Claremont Graduate School and University Center. Five years later, in 1967, the name was again changed to Claremont University Center, and in 1998 it acquired the name Claremont Graduate University.\n\nThe Claremont Colleges were designed to incorporate the Oxford Model of higher education. Instead of one large university composed of several separate schools, the Claremont Colleges are made up of different institutions designed around differing theories of pedagogy. CGU was founded upon the principle that graduate education is separate and distinct from undergraduate education. Students discover and cultivate their disciplines during undergraduate course work; at CGU students continue cultivation of their own disciplines, but are also expected to augment this with research that incorporates other disciplines as well. This is called \"Transdisciplinarity\", and is an essential component of Claremont Graduate University’s functioning theory of pedagogy.\n\nThe school is home to about 2,200 masters and PhD students, as well as approximately 200 full and part-time faculty members. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has classified Claremont Graduate University as a CompDoc/NMedVet: Comprehensive doctoral (no medical/veterinary) with high research activity. Its five academic schools and one independent department award master's or/and doctoral degrees in 31 disciplines. Enrollment is limited and classes are small.\n\nAmong the contiguous CGU, Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences, and undergraduate colleges (Pomona, Claremont McKenna, Harvey Mudd, Scripps, and Pitzer), academic collaboration is highly valued. Cross-registration is free, and the members share libraries, health care, security, and other facilities.\n\nThe School of Arts and Humanities includes departments in the fields of Art, Religion, Music, English, Cultural studies, Archival studies, History, Applied Women's studies, and Philosophy. These subjects have an interest in interdisciplinary studies that provide disciplinary depth as well as cross-disciplinary flexibility.\nIn the Department of Religion, students can earn a degree with a focus in Mormon Studies, Catholicism, Islamic Studies, History of Christianity, Hebrew Bible, Indic Studies, Coptic Studies, Zoroastrianism; additional programs include Women's Studies in Religion, Religion and American Politics, Ethics and Culture, and Philosophy of Religion and Theology.\n\nSSSPE encompasses the Division of Politics and Economics and the Division of Behavioral and Organizational Sciences. SSSPE offers M.A. and Ph.D. programs in Political Science, American Politics & Political Philosophy, Public Policy & Evaluation, International Studies (Comparative and/or World Politics), International Political Economy, Economics, Global Commerce & Finance, and joint degrees with MBA. SSSPE offers the first Ph.D. and M.A. concentrations in the Western United States focused on the Science of Positive Psychology.. The program also offers the first Ph.D. degree in neuroeconomics which bridges economics, psychology, and public policy.\n\nFormed in 2008, the School of Community and Global Health is dedicated to generating scientific knowledge about the causes and prevention of disease and the improvement of health and well-being of diverse populations locally and globally. The school is responsible for training professional practitioners to translate prevention science into improved practice and policy for health promotion and disease prevention at the individual, community and global levels. The school offers a Ph.D. in Health Promotion Sciences and M.P.H. degrees; the M.P.H. program, which has a variety of concentrations, is fully accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health. The five-year accreditation—the longest allowable for a newly accredited program—was announced on July 9, 2012.\n\nThe Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito School of Management follows the Drucker philosophy based on people (management as a human enterprise, as a liberal art) and looks beyond traditional perceptions of economics, instead espousing management as a liberal art, focusing on social theory, history, and sustainability.\n\nThe School of Educational Studies offers the M.A. and Ph.D in Teaching, Learning and Culture, Education Policy, Evaluation and Reform, Higher Education/Student Affairs, Special Education and Urban Educational Leadership.\n\nCISAT was founded in 1983 by Paul Gray as an independent entity. Unconstrained by a typical business school structure, students are allowed to focus specifically on those topics associated with IS&T. The school provides a solid technical grounding in IT systems, while at the same time, addressing the significant management challenges to designing, developing, implementing and assessing IT systems in applied business and governmental settings.\n\nIn conjunction with the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden, Claremont Graduate University offers master's and doctoral degrees in botany emphasizing systematics and evolution of higher plants. Subfields include monographic and revisionary studies, cytotaxonomy, molecular systematics, phylogenetics, plant anatomy and comparative aspmorphology, ecology, plant geography, and reproductive biology.\n\nPeter Drucker Institute is a think tank and action tank based at Claremont Graduate University that was established to advance the ideas and ideals of Peter F. Drucker, the father of modern management.\n\nThe Getty Leadership Institute at Claremont Graduate University is a leading source of continuing professional development for current and future leaders of museums and other nonprofit institutions.\n\nThe Institute of Mathematical Sciences offers a variety of masters and doctoral degrees, and maintains a strong applied research component through its internationally recognized Engineering and Industrial Applied Mathematics Clinic, offering students first-hand experience in solving significant problems in applied mathematics for business and industry clients. IMS also provides joint programs in financial engineering, computational science, and computational and systems biology.\n\nAs part of the Claremont Colleges, CGU sits on of land and includes over 175 buildings that is home to the Claremont University Consortium in Claremont, California.\n\nIn July 2007, CNN/Money magazine ranked Claremont as one of the top 5 places to live in the United States.\n\nHarper Hall\nHarper Hall is the oldest building on CGU's campus, originally housing the graduate library. It is now the administration building centralizing CGU's student and administrative functions. Classrooms and study areas take up a majority of Harper Hall’s lower level.\n\nStauffer Hall and Albrecht auditorium\n\nThe Academic computing building\nThe ACB is a three-story, facility completed in 1985, which was renovated in 2009 to include the third floor. It houses academic computing resources, the School of Social Science, Policy, & Evaluation, the Center for Information Systems and Technology, two computer labs, and the Kay E-Health Center. It is also home to the Paul Gray PC Museum.\n\nRon W. Burkle Building\nThe Ron W. Burkle building was completed in 1998. Named after CGU fellow Ronald Burkle, it is currently home to the Peter Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management. It is a three-story, facility housing offices, classrooms and lecture halls, the Drucker Library and the Drucker Institute.\n\nDes Combes Gate\n\nThe CGU Art Building\nThe CGU Art Building is home to two galleries, The East Gallery and the Peggy Phelps Gallery. During the semester the galleries feature work by current MFA students as well as special exhibits curated by professors, featuring the work of local artists. The art building has an independent studio space for each student measuring 22 by 12 feet. Once a year, the art building and all of the studios are opened to the public in an event called \"Open Studios.\"\n\nThe \"Paul Gray PC Museum\" is a computer museum at Claremont Graduate University. It is named in honor of Paul Gray, a former professor at the university, and is located in the Center for Information Systems and Technology. As of November 12, 2005, the museum is showing the \"Best PCs Ever\", based on the article \"The 25 Greatest PCs of All Time\" published by PC World.\n\nClaremont Graduate University is home to the Kinglsey Tufts Poetry Award. The Award is presented annually for a work by an emerging poet. The award was established in 1992 by Kate Tufts to honor her late husband, poet and writer Kingsley Tufts. It is the largest monetary prize in the nation for a mid-career poet.\n\n\n\n"}

It posits that most people are not interested in activism; instead, they want to use the web for mundane activities, including surfing for pornography and lolcats (\"cute cats\"). The tools that they develop for that (such as Facebook, Flickr, Blogger, Twitter, and similar platforms) are very useful to social movement activists, who may lack resources to develop dedicated tools themselves. This, in turn, makes the activists more immune to reprisals by governments than if they were using a dedicated activism platform, because shutting down a popular public platform provokes a larger public outcry than shutting down an obscure one.\n\nZuckerman states that \"Web 1.0 was invented to allow physicists to share research papers. Web 2.0 was created to allow people to share pictures of cute cats.\" Zuckerman says that if a tool passes \"cute cat\" purposes, and is widely used for low-value purposes, it can be and likely is used for online activism, too.\n\nIf the government chooses to shut down such generic tools, it will hurt people's ability to \"look at cute cats online\", spreading dissent and encouraging the activists' cause.\n\nAccording to Zuckerman, internet censorship in the People's Republic of China, which relies on its own, self-censored, Web 2.0 sites, is able to circumvent the cute-cat problem because the government is able to provide people with access to cute-cat content on domestic, self-censored sites while blocking access to Western sites, which are less popular in China than in many other places worldwide.\n\n\"Sufficiently usable read/write platforms will attract porn and activists. If there's no porn, the tool doesn't work. If there are no activists, it doesn't work well,\" Zuckerman has stated.\n\n"}
{"id": "8392594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8392594", "title": "Devota", "text": "Devota\n\nSaint Devota (; died ca. 303 AD) is the patron saint of Corsica and Monaco. She was killed during the persecutions of Diocletian and Maximian. She is sometimes identified with another Corsican saint named Julia, who was described in Latin as \"Deo devota\" (\"devoted to God\"). The description was misinterpreted as a proper name. The legend connected with her is similar to those told of other saints of the region, such as Saint Reparata and Saint Torpes.\n\nTradition holds that she was a Corsican woman born around 283 AD at Mariana. A young virgin, she had decided to devote herself fully to the service of God. Devota was part the household of senator Eutychius. During the Diocletian persecution, the prefect Barbarus arrived in Corsica with a fleet and when he learned that the senator was harboring a Christian in his house, demanded that she be given up and compelled to perform the requisite sacrifice to the imperial cult. Eutychius refused, and not wishing to confront him directly, Barbarus arranged to have him poisoned. Devota was imprisoned and tortured for her faith. Her mouth was crushed, and her body was dragged through rocks and brambles. She was martyred at Mariana by being racked or stoned to death.\n\nAfter her death, the governor of the province ordered for her body to be burnt to prevent its veneration. However, it was saved from the flames by Christians. Her body was placed on a boat bound for Africa. Gratianus (Graziano), the boat's pilot; Benedict (Benenato), a priest; and Apollinaris, his deacon; believed it would receive proper Christian burial there. However, a storm overtook the boat. A dove appeared and guided the boat to present-day Les Gaumates, today part of the Principality of Monaco, where a chapel dedicated to Saint George stood.\n\nIn her honor a chapel was built, which stands in Monaco still. Traditionally, flowers are said to bloom before their season on January 27, the saint's feast day.\n\nThe Sainte-Dévote Chapel is first mentioned about 1070, belonging to the abbey of Saint Pons. The chapel was rebuilt and expanded several times. It became a priory in the 13th century and in 1536 was acquired by Honoré I, Lord of Monaco. The chapel became the parish church in 1887.\n\nThe “Legend of Saint Devota” is one of the Principality of Monaco’s oldest traditions – it has influenced national culture in fields as diverse as religion, folklore and popular beliefs, history, literature, the arts, painting, music, coins and stamps. This legend, passed on through a medieval document, holds a special place in the heart of Monaco's people and over the centuries has been awarded a permanent place in the city's history.\nReports of miracles soon sprung in connection with the tomb. During incursions by Moors, Devota's relics were translated to safety at the monastery of Cimiez. They were returned to Monaco, to a church restored much later by Antonio I, prince of Monaco.\n\nIn 1070, Antinope, the captain of a Florentine ship, attempted to steal the reliquary containing Devota's relics. The legend states that a violent wind impeded him from escaping with the relics. Arrested, Ugo Grimaldi ordered his ears and nose to be cut off. Antinope's boat was then burnt on the beach of Monaco.\n\nIn the 16th century, Devota was invoked for protection against the Genoese and the Pisans. Their ultimate failure to take away the independence of Monaco was attributed to the divine protection of Devota. An end to the outbreak of the plague in 1631 was attributed to Devota, as well as the expulsion of the Spanish on the night of 17 November 1641 -a galley taken from the Spanish was rebaptized \"Devota.\" Monégasque coins bearing the effigy of Devota were issued in the 16th century, beginning in the reign of Honoré II, Prince of Monaco. During his reign, Devota became the patroness of Monaco.\n\nA series of postage stamps bearing Devota's likeness were issued in 1944 as well as 1992.\n\nHowever, one source has commented that \"Saint Devota's name is unfortunately heard on the radio waves solely for the Monaco's Grand Prix Formula 1 for the famous bend of Saint Devota.\"\n\nJoseph Méry put the legend of Saint Devota into verse. The first book written in Monegasque language by the Monegasque poet, Louis Notari, is entitled \"A legenda de Santa Devota\" (The Legend of Saint Devota). It was composed in 1927 and is important because until then the Monégasque language, had been utilized for speech.\n\nHer cult became important to Monaco and the Grimaldis. Since 1874 it has been the custom that on the evening before her feast day a symbolic fishing boat is brought in procession into Port-Hercule and set alight outside the Église Sainte Dévote. This is followed by a fireworks display that lights up Port-Hercule.\n\nOn January 27, Mass is celebrated in the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception attended by HSH Prince Albert II and HSH Princess Charlene. It is followed by a Solemn Procession of the Relics, to request protection for the Royal Family and the Principality. Receptions in the Monte Carlo Opera House also take place. Albert II, Prince of Monaco participates in this ceremony.\n\nIn 2014 the Monegasque Rugby Federation, in association with the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation, organized the Saint Devota Rugby Challenge. Including teams from Spain and Italy, the free program includes educational workshops and circuits for disabled children, to introduce them to the game.\n\nIn the 1687, some of Devota's relics were transported from Monaco to the Jesuit church of Sant'Ignazio on the island. Between 1727 and 1751, attempts were made to receive from the Vatican official recognition of Devota as special patroness of Corsica. These were refused because there was scant evidence of her existence. However, the diffusion of her cult continued and Pasquale Paoli created a short-lived \"Order of Saint Devota\" in 1757 during the movement for Corsican independence.\n\nIn 1820, the first bishop of the diocese of Corsica proclaimed both Saint Devota and Saint Julia to be the principal patron saints of Corsica. In 1893, a church was dedicated to Saint Devota on the island. Her cult was officially approved in 1984 by the bishop of Ajaccio. The new \"Roman Martyrology\" commemorates her on January 27, with the description, \"At Mariana, on the island of Corsica, in memory of Saint Devota, virgin and martyr.\"\n\nSaint Devota was recently selected as the main motif of a high value collector's coin; the €5 silver 1700th anniversary of Saint Devota's death commemorative coin, minted in 2004. On the reverse of the coin, a statue of the saint can be seen. Next to it, a representation of the dove guiding the boat to the coast of Monaco, as recorded in the legend, can be observed.\n\n\n"}

Originally it was an all-white association and it now is the premier elite association in Bangladesh.\n\nDhaka club has been described as \"an oasis of calm in a frantic city, a colonial relic with several acres of lawns, tennis courts, reading rooms.\" It has been noted that \"the real old-school Dhaka wealth and political power calls this recreation club home.\" According to journalist M. J. Akbar, \"In times of ferment the city is ruled by Dhaka University; in times of peace the city is controlled by Dhaka Club.\"\n\nThe club is located near Shahbag Intersection. It is surrounded by Dhaka University, Bangladesh National Museum, Hotel Sheraton, BIRDEM Hospital, Ramna Park and the Suhrawardy Udyan.\n\nThe club has facilities for meetings and seminars, as well as hall rooms, guest-rooms, kitchens and dining rooms, playing courts and rooms for table tennis, billiards, cards, squash, and lawn tennis, and a swimming pool. The wood-paneled club house is one of the few surviving British Raj era buildings in Dhaka. The Dhaka Club has three clay tennis courts and two squash courts. In former times, indoor and outdoor games were dominant features of the club. At present, it gives considerable attention to cultural activities.\n\nThe origins of the club date back to 1825 when European residents in Old Dhaka established a Gentleman's club in Victoria Park (now known as Bahadur Shah Park) by that name. It was established in place of an older club known as the Armenian Club or the \"Antagar\" (a corruption of \"Addagar\" or Gossip House). The last name rendered its name to the park which came to be known as \"Antagar Maidan\" (Antaghor Field). After the club shifted elsewhere East India Company bought the land in 1862. In 1851 the club premise shifted to Ramna with help from local aristocrats along with Europeans. The land of Dhaka Club was leased out from the Dhaka Nawab Family from his Shahbag garden estate.\n\nAfter the partition of Bengal in 1905, dhaka was made the capital of the new province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. The British civilians, who came to govern the new province, felt the need of a social club. The club was fashioned after the model of the Bengal Club of Kolkata. It was registered on 19 August 1911 and was granted legal status on 14 September 1911 under the Indian Companies Act of 1882. The founding members were Lt. Col. EA Hall (Civil Surgeon, Dhaka), CR Bryan, HG Bally (Commandant, Military Police Battalion, Dhaka), JO Rennie (PWD, Dhaka), and JS Wilson and AT Halliday of Indian Police, Dhaka.\n\nAccording to journalist M. J. Akbar, \"The British reunited Bengal in 1911 and compensated Dhaka with the Dhaka University and the Dhaka Club.\" The membership of the club grew quickly in the 1920s and '30s as many Europeans came to Dhaka in connection with the jute trade, steam navigation, the railway, and estate management. Many of the members were high-ranking British officers from Minto Road. Natives, including aristocrats of Dhaka Nawab Family, were banned, while Anglo-Indians had full access.\n\nIn 1941, the Governor of Bengal leased out a tract of land comprising 524 bighas (173 acres) to the Dhaka Club. The club used the land to develop a racecourse (known as ramna racecourse, now converted into Ramna Garden), a golf course, the club buildings and playgrounds. The golf course is one of the oldest golf courses in South Asia, and was owned and managed by Dhaka Club and nearby Gymkhana Club together. Gymkhana Club, located at the opposing side of Shahbag gardens, also patronized the Racecourse together with Dhaka Club. During Bangladesh Liberation War the club was closed accept for a few staff. On 26 March 1971 Pakistani army tried to enter the club but Madhuraj, the Nepali security guard, refused entry. He along with few other staff were executed by Pakistan army after they forcefully entered the club. After the Independence of Bangladesh, the club adapted more Bengali characteristics. In 1973 it changed the Letter head of the club to Bangla. In 1978 Geetiara Safya Chowdhury became the first female member of the club. Into the 21st century the club arrived with only about 5 acres (20,000 m2) of land left in its control, as the rest has been overtaken by the government of Bangladesh by acquisition.\n\nThe club is run by an executive committee comprising a president and 10 members who are elected for a one-year term in a general meeting. The right to vote is limited to 1,500 permanent and life members as well as general members. who form a highly privileged company. That total figure of 1,500 is strictly protected, though any member can resign and nominate his successor. A past president was forced to resign because he “accidentally” allowed this limit to be exceeded that number. Foreigners can become members for an annual fee. However, members are of different categories such as life members, general members, honorary members, special members, and officers of the defense forces. The total number of members of the club in 2016 was 3,120, a figure that is considered as the highest membership limit.\n\nThe rules and regulations of the remain the same from the times of the Raj. No locals are permitted in the lounge, the bar, the dining room or the card room. The only concession that the Dhaka Club has made is to permit the loose kurta inside its premises. For men the dress rule is collared shirt and covered shoes.\n\n\n"}

A player can have as many stones of any size as he wants, but can play only two at a time.\n\nDegor can be played as a team game or individual game. If there are three persons, the game is played as on individual gaming basis. If there are four or more persons, it is preferred to be played in two teams that compete against each other. There is no fixed numbers of players on the teams, but too many players make the game slower and cumbersome. So, normally seven players on each team is the maximum number for an ideal game.\n\nUnlike shot put, each player hurls a pair of spherical stones to the targets from one end to the other by swinging the arm below the shoulders. The target pegs are nailed into the ground with their tips at ground level. As in horseshoes, the players try to make their stone land and remain closest to the target peg. A point is scored if the distance between stone and the peg is less than the distance between the thumb and middle finger of an outstretched palm. If two or more stones of opponent teams fall in same range, the closest stone will score the point. If all stones in the range belong to one team, then the team will score as many points as the number of stones. There is no fixed point score at which the game ends, but it is normally fixed at odd numbers up to 21, depending on the number of the players and the time the teams have.\n\nUnlike in archery, in Degor the best players play first to occupy the area near the target. The players playing later are allowed to hit the stones of opponent players that have been played before with their own stones to displace them from the target and replace them with their stones. But it is more difficult if the stones played beforehand are heavy and solid. So, players prefer heavier stones so that these cannot be easily displaced or can be used as a better force to displace other players' stones.\n\nBetting on the game differs from region to region and the occasion of the game being played. If the game is being played between villages, there may or may not be a bet. At times it is just played for the fame of victory. However, the game is mostly played to celebrate some occasions such as New Year and other major holidays. On such occasions, the betting is normally fixed on a grand feast and party where the loser will have to stand for the party solely or major chunk while the winner could share a little part. This kind of betting usually occurs for merrymaking and socializing within the communities or among the friends.\n"}

{"id": "571941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=571941", "title": "Ethnobotany", "text": "Ethnobotany\n\nEthnobotany is the study of a region's plants and their practical uses through the traditional knowledge of a local culture and people. An ethnobotanist thus strives to document the local customs involving the practical uses of local flora for many aspects of life, such as plants as medicines, foods, and clothing. Richard Evans Schultes, often referred to as the \"father of ethnobotany\", explained the discipline in this way:\nEthnobotany simply means ... investigating plants used by societies in various parts of the world.\n\nSince the time of Schultes, the field of ethnobotany has grown from simply acquiring ethnobotanical knowledge to that of applying it to a modern society, primarily in the form of pharmaceuticals. Intellectual property rights and benefit-sharing arrangements are important issues in ethnobotany.\n\nThe idea of ethnobotany was first proposed by the early 20th century botanist John William Harshberger. While Harshberger did perform ethnobotanical research extensively, including in areas such as North Africa, Mexico, Scandinavia, and Pennsylvania, it was not until Richard Evans Schultes began his trips into the Amazon that ethnobotany become a more well known science. However, the practice of ethnobotany is thought to have much earlier origins in the first century AD when a Greek physician by the name of Pedanius Dioscorides wrote an extensive botanical text detailing the medical and culinary properties of \"over 600 mediterranean plants\" named De Materia Medica. Historians note that Dioscorides wrote about traveling often throughout the Roman empire, including regions such as \"Greece, Crete, Egypt, and Petra\", and in doing so obtained substantial knowledge about the local plants and their useful properties. European botanical knowledge drastically expanded once the New World was discovered due to ethnobotany. This expansion in knowledge can be primarily attributed to the substantial influx of new plants from the Americas, including crops such as potatoes, peanuts, avocados, and tomatoes. One French explorer in the 16th century, Jacques Cartier, learned a cure for scurvy (a tea made from boiling the bark of the Sitka Spruce) from a local Iroquois tribe.\n\nDuring the medieval period, ethnobotanical studies were commonly found connected with monasticism. Notable at this time was Hildegard von Bingen. However, most botanical knowledge was kept in gardens such as physic gardens attached to hospitals and religious buildings. It was thought of in practical use terms for culinary and medical purposes and the ethnographic element was not studied as a modern anthropologist might approach ethnobotany today.\n\nCarl Linnaeus carried out in 1732 a research expedition in Scandinavia asking the Sami people about their ethnological usage of plants.\n\nThe age of enlightenment saw a rise in economic botanical exploration. Alexander von Humboldt collected data from the New World, and James Cook's voyages brought back collections and information on plants from the South Pacific. At this time major botanical gardens were started, for instance the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 1759. The directors of the gardens sent out gardener-botanist explorers to care for and collect plants to add to their collections.\n\nAs the 18th century became the 19th, ethnobotany saw expeditions undertaken with more colonial aims rather than trade economics such as that of Lewis and Clarke which recorded both plants and the peoples encountered use of them. Edward Palmer collected material culture artifacts and botanical specimens from people in the North American West (Great Basin) and Mexico from the 1860s to the 1890s. Through all of this research, the field of \"aboriginal botany\" was established—the study of all forms of the vegetable world which aboriginal peoples use for food, medicine, textiles, ornaments and more.\n\nThe first individual to study the emic perspective of the plant world was a German physician working in Sarajevo at the end of the 19th century: Leopold Glück. His published work on traditional medical uses of plants done by rural people in Bosnia (1896) has to be considered the first modern ethnobotanical work.\nOther scholars analyzed uses of plants under an indigenous/local perspective in the 20th century: Matilda Coxe Stevenson, Zuni plants (1915); Frank Cushing, Zuni foods (1920); Keewaydinoquay Peschel, Anishinaabe fungi (1998), and the team approach of Wilfred Robbins, John Peabody Harrington, and Barbara Freire-Marreco, Tewa pueblo plants (1916).\n\nIn the beginning, ethonobotanical specimens and studies were not very reliable and sometimes not helpful. This is because the botanists and the anthropologists did not always collaborate in their work. The botanists focused on identifying species and how the plants were used instead of concentrating upon how plants fit into people's lives. On the other hand, anthropologists were interested in the cultural role of plants and treated other scientific aspects superficially. In the early 20th century, botanists and anthropologists better collaborated and the collection of reliable, detailed cross-disciplinary data began.\n\nBeginning in the 20th century, the field of ethnobotany experienced a shift from the raw compilation of data to a greater methodological and conceptual reorientation. This is also the beginning of academic ethnobotany. The so-called \"father\" of this discipline is Richard Evans Schultes, even though he did not actually coin the term \"ethnobotany\". Today the field of ethnobotany requires a variety of skills: botanical training for the identification and preservation of plant specimens; anthropological training to understand the cultural concepts around the perception of plants; linguistic training, at least enough to transcribe local terms and understand native morphology, syntax, and semantics.\n\nMark Plotkin, who studied at Harvard University, the Yale School of Forestry and Tufts University, has contributed a number of books on ethnobotany. He completed a handbook for the Tirio people of Suriname detailing their medicinal plants; \"Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice\" (1994); \"The Shaman's Apprentice,\" a children's book with Lynne Cherry (1998); and \"Medicine Quest: In Search of Nature's Healing Secrets\" (2000).\n\nPlotkin was interviewed in 1998 by \"South American Explorer\" magazine, just after the release of \"Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice\" and the IMAX movie Amazonia. In the book, he stated that he saw wisdom in both traditional and Western forms of medicine:\nNo medical system has all the answers—no shaman that I've worked with has the equivalent of a polio vaccine and no dermatologist that I've been to could cure a fungal infection as effectively (and inexpensively) as some of my Amazonian mentors. It shouldn't be the doctor versus the witch doctor. It should be the best aspects of all medical systems (ayurvedic, herbalism, homeopathic, and so on) combined in a way which makes health care more effective and more affordable for all.\n\nA great deal of information about the traditional uses of plants is still intact with tribal peoples. But the native healers are often reluctant to accurately share their knowledge to outsiders. Schultes actually apprenticed himself to an Amazonian shaman, which involves a long-term commitment and genuine relationship. In \"Wind in the Blood: Mayan Healing & Chinese Medicine\" by Garcia et al. the visiting acupuncturists were able to access levels of Mayan medicine that anthropologists could not because they had something to share in exchange. Cherokee medicine priest David Winston describes how his uncle would invent nonsense to satisfy visiting anthropologists.\n\nAnother scholar, James W. Herrick, who studied under ethnologist William N. Fenton, in his work \"Iroquois Medical Ethnobotany\" (1995) with Dean R. Snow (editor), professor of Anthropology at Penn State, explains that understanding herbal medicines in traditional Iroquois cultures is rooted in a strong and ancient cosmological belief system. Their work provides perceptions and conceptions of illness and imbalances which can manifest in physical forms from benign maladies to serious diseases. It also includes a large compilation of Herrick’s field work from numerous Iroquois authorities of over 450 names, uses, and preparations of plants for various ailments. Traditional Iroquois practitioners had (and have) a sophisticated perspective on the plant world that contrast strikingly with that of modern medical science.\n\nResearcher Cassandra Quave at Emory University has used ethnobotany to address the problems that arise from antibiotic resistance. Quave notes that the advantage of medical ethnobotany over Western medicine rests in the difference in mechanism. For example, elmleaf blackberry extract focuses instead on the prevention of bacterial collaboration as opposed to directly exterminating them. \n\nMany instances of gender bias have occurred in ethnobotany, creating the risk of drawing erroneous conclusions. Anthropologists would often consult with primarily men. In Las Pavas, a small farming community in Panama, anthropologists drew conclusions about the entire community's use of plant from their conversations and lessons with mostly men. They consulted with 40 families, but the women only participated rarely in interviews and never joined them in the field. Due to the division of labor, the knowledge of wild plants for food, medicine, and fibers, among others, was left out of the picture, resulting in a distorted view of which plants were actually important to them. \n\nEthnobotanists have also assumed that ownership of a resource means familiarity with that resource. In some societies women are excluded from owning land, while being the ones who work it. Inaccurate data can come from interviewing only the owners. \n\nOther issues include ethical concerns regarding interactions with indigenous populations, and the International Society of Ethnobiology has created a code of ethics to guide researchers.\n\n\n"}

This typically involves new stories for existing characters already developed within the franchise, but in some cases entirely new characters and complex mythology are developed. This is not necessarily the same as an adaptation, which is a retelling of the same story that may or may not adhere to accepted canon. Nearly every media franchise with a committed fan base has some form of expanded universe.\n\nTwo prominent examples of media franchises with an expanded universe are \"Star Wars\" and \"Star Trek\", which both have a wide range of original novels, comics, video games, and other media that add to the mythology of their fictional universe in different ways. In both cases, entirely new characters and situations have been developed that exist only within the expanded universe media.\n\nAlthough there are some exceptions, expanded universe works are generally accepted as canon, or part of the \"official\" storyline continuity. Otherwise, they are considered apocrypha. In some cases, characters created for an expanded universe are later featured in the primary works associated with that franchise, as in the cases of Aayla Secura and Grand Admiral Thrawn in the \"Star Wars\" franchise. When all expanded universe works (films, novels, comic books, video games, role-playing games, etc.) are considered canonical, then the expanded universe is an \"imaginary entertainment environment.\" \n\n\n"}

It protected the neck from chafing by the armor. The \"focale\" is depicted widely in military scenes from Roman art, such as the relief sculpture on the Arch of Septimius Severus in the Roman Forum and Trajan's Column. It is shown loosely knotted in the front, but is sometimes visible with the ends tucked inside the cuirass.\nIn Latin literature, \"focale\" is a general word for a scarf or wrapping for the throat. A \"focale\" was one of the gifts that might be given for the December festival of Saturnalia, according to Martial. In one of his satires, Horace lists \"focalia\" among the \"badges of illness\" \"(insignia morbi)\". In describing the correct attire for public speaking, Quintilian advises against wearing a \"focale\", unless required by poor health.\n\nAlthough a \"sudarium\" often is used as a handkerchief, it can be worn like the \"focale\" as a neckerchief. When Suetonius describes the overly casual attire of Nero, the emperor is barefoot, unbelted, and dressed in evening wear \"(synthesis)\", with a \"sudarium\" around his neck. In late antiquity, \"orarium\" (Greek \"orarion\") might be synonymous with \"focale\", as in the description of military attire in the \"Vision of Dorotheus\", and in a papyrus (dated 350–450 AD) listing military clothes.\n\nThe \"focale\" is sometimes seen as one of the precursors of the necktie. Cesare Vecellio (1530–1606) mentions the \"focale\", calling it a \"cravata\" (cravat), as worn by Roman soldiers in his book on the history of fashion. It has been compared to the \"amice\" \"(amictus)\" worn by Roman Catholic priests, which is depicted from the 6th century onward, as in the Ravenna mosaics.\n"}
{"id": "5890561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5890561", "title": "Form (education)", "text": "Form (education)\n\nA form is an educational stage, class, or grouping of pupils in a school. The term is used predominantly in the United Kingdom, although some schools, mostly private, in other countries also use the title. Pupils are usually grouped in forms according to age and will remain with the same group for a number of years, or sometimes their entire school career. In North America, the 1st Form (or sometimes 'Form I') is equivalent to 7th Grade.\n\nDuring the Victorian era a \"form\" was the bench upon which pupils sat to receive lessons. In some smaller schools the entire school would be educated in a single room, with different age groups sitting on different benches.\n\nForms are normally identified by a number such as \"first form\" or \"sixth form\". A form number may be used for two year groups and differentiated by the terms upper and lower. The sixth form is the senior form of a school. In England, the 6th Form (Key Stage 5) is usually divided into two year groups: the lower sixth and upper sixth, owing to the 3-year English college/university system. In Scotland or North America, the 6th form is usually a single year, owing to the 4-year college/university system. If there is more than one form for each year group they will normally be differentiated by letters, e.g., \"upper four B\", \"lower two Y\". Schools do not follow a consistent pattern in naming forms.\n\nAnother common identification for form, and one of the most common in New Zealand, is the number of the year they are in, followed by the initials of the teacher who takes the form class. E.g., a Year 7 form whose teacher is John Smith would be 7JS (or 7SJ or 7SM if there is already another teacher in the school with the initials JS). Alternatively, some schools use \"vertical\" form classes where pupils across several year groups from the same school house are grouped together. In this case, the numeral is replaced with the first letter of the house name (e.g. RJS for a Red House form class whose teacher is John Smith).\n\n"}

This index is released by UNESCO. In its simplest form, it is calculated as the quotient of the number of females by the number of males enrolled in a given stage of education (primary, secondary, etc.). It is used by international organizations, particularly in measuring the progress of developing countries. The Institute for Statistics of UNESCO also uses a more general definition of GPI: for any development indicator one can define the GPI \"relative\" to this indicator by dividing its value for females by its value for males. For example, some UNESCO documents consider gender parity in literacy. \n\nUNESCO describes attempts to eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education and emphasizes the plight of girls in unequal access in third world countries. However, the GPI ignores the gender disparity that benefits first-world women in tertiary education as in Iceland, for example, where 65% of students enrolling in tertiary education are female.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4937086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4937086", "title": "Global commons", "text": "Global commons\n\nGlobal commons is a term typically used to describe international, supranational, and global resource domains in which common-pool resources are found. Global commons include the earth's shared natural resources, such as the high oceans, the atmosphere and outer space and the Antarctic in particular. Cyberspace may also meet the definition of a global commons.\n\n\"Global commons\" is a term typically used to describe international, supranational, and global resource domains in which common-pool resources are found. In economics, common goods are rivalrous and non-excludable, constituting one of the four main types of goods. A common-pool resource, also called a common property resource, is a special case of a common good (or public good) whose size or characteristics makes it costly, but not impossible, to exclude potential users. Examples include both natural or human-made resource domains (e.g., a \"fishing hole\" or an irrigation system). Unlike global public goods, global common-pool resources face problems of congestion, overuse, or degradation because they are subtractable (which makes them rivalrous).\n\nThe term \"commons\" originates from the term common land in the British Isles. \"Commoners rights\" referred to traditional rights held by commoners, such as mowing meadows for hay or grazing livestock on common land held in the open field system of old English common law. Enclosure was the process that ended those traditional rights, converting open fields to private property. Today, many commons still exist in England, Wales, Scotland, and the United States, although their extent is much reduced from the millions of acres that existed until the 17th century. There are still over 7,000 registered commons in England alone.\n\nThe term \"global commons\" is typically used to indicate the earth's shared natural resources, such as the deep oceans, the atmosphere, outer space and the Northern and Southern polar regions, the Antarctic in particular.\n\nAccording to the \"World Conservation Strategy\", a report on conservation published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) in collaboration with UNESCO and with the support of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF):\nToday, the Internet, World Wide Web and resulting cyberspace are often referred to as global commons. Other usages sometimes include references to open access information of all kinds, including arts and culture, language and science, though these are more formally referred to as the common heritage of mankind.\n\nThe key challenge of the global commons is the design of governance structures and management systems capable of addressing the complexity of multiple public and private interests, subject to often unpredictable changes, ranging from the local to the global level. As with global public goods, management of the global commons requires pluralistic legal entities, usually international and supranational, public and private, structured to match the diversity of interests and the type of resource to be managed, and stringent enough with adequate incentives to ensure compliance. Such management systems are necessary to avoid, at the global level, the classic tragedy of the commons, in which common resources become overexploited.\n\nThere are several key differences in management of resources in the global commons from those of the commons, in general. There are obvious differences in scale of both the resources and the number of users at the local versus the global level. Also, there are differences in the shared culture and expectations of resource users; more localized commons users tend to be more homogeneous and global users more heterogeneous. This contributes to differences in the possibility and time it takes for new learning about resource usage to occur at the different levels. Moreover, global resource pools are less likely to be relatively stable and the dynamics are less easily understood. Many of the global commons are non-renewable on human time scales. Thus, resource degradation is more likely to be the result of unintended consequences that are unforeseen, not immediately observable, or not easily understood. For example, the carbon dioxide emissions that drive climate change continue to do so for at least a millennium after they enter the atmosphere and species extinctions last forever. Importantly, because there are significant differences in the benefits, costs, and interests at the global level, there are significant differences in externalities between more local resource uses and uses of global-level resources.\n\nSeveral environmental protocols have been established (see List of international environmental agreements) as a type of international law, \"an intergovernmental document intended as legally binding with a primary stated purpose of preventing or managing human impacts on natural resources.\" International environmental protocols came to feature in environmental governance after trans-boundary environmental problems became widely perceived in the 1960s. Following the Stockholm Intergovernmental Conference in 1972, creation of international environmental agreements proliferated. Due to the barriers already discussed, environmental protocols are not a panacea for global commons issues. Often, they are slow to produce the desired effects, tend to the lowest common denominator, and lack monitoring and enforcement. They also take an incremental approach to solutions where sustainable development principles suggest that environmental concerns should be mainstream political issues.\n\nThe global or world ocean, as the interconnected system of the Earth's oceanic (or marine) waters that comprise the bulk of the hydrosphere, is a classic global commons. It is divided into a number of principal oceanic areas that are delimited by the continents and various oceanographic features. In turn, oceanic waters are interspersed by many smaller seas, gulfs, and bays. Further, most freshwater bodies ultimately empty into the ocean and are derived through the Earth's water cycle from ocean waters. The Law of the Sea is a body of public international law governing relationships between nations in respect to navigational rights, mineral rights, and jurisdiction over coastal waters. Maritime law, also called Admiralty law, is a body of both domestic law governing maritime activities and private international law governing the relationships between private entities which operate vessels on the oceans. It deals with matters including marine commerce, marine navigation, shipping, sailors, and the transportation of passengers and goods by sea. However, these bodies of law do little to nothing to protect deep oceans from human threats.\n\nIn addition to providing significant means of transportation, a large proportion of all life on Earth exists in its ocean, which contains about 300 times the habitable volume of terrestrial habitats. Specific marine habitats include coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass meadows, tidepools, muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean (pelagic) zone, where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary. The organisms studied range from microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton to huge cetaceans (whales) 30 meters (98 feet) in length.\n\nAt a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine life resources provide food (especially food fish), medicines, and raw materials. It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the carbon cycle) and of air (such as Earth's respiration, and movement of energy through ecosystems including the ocean). Marine organisms contribute significantly to the oxygen cycle, and are involved in the regulation of the Earth's climate. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land.\n\nThe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has identified several areas of need in managing the global ocean: strengthen national capacities for action, especially in developing countries; improve fisheries management; reinforce cooperation in semi-enclosed and regional seas; strengthen controls over ocean disposal of hazardous and nuclear wastes; and advance the Law of the Sea. Specific problems identified as in need of attention include rising sea levels; contamination by hazardours chemicals (including oil spills); microbiological contamination; ocean acidification; harmful algal blooms; and over-fishing and other overexploitation. Further, the Pew Charitable Trusts Environmental Initiative program has identified a need for a worldwide system of very large, highly protected marine reserves where fishing and other extractive activities are prohibited.\n\nThe atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet Earth. A primary concern for management of the global atmosphere is air pollution, the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulates, or biological materials that cause discomfort, disease, or death to humans, damage other living organisms such as food crops, or damage the natural environment or built environment. Stratospheric ozone depletion due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the Earth's ecosystems.\n\nPollution of breathable air is a central problem in the management of the global commons. Pollutants can be in the form of solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and may be natural or man-made. Although controversial and limited in scope by methods of enforcement, in several parts of the world the polluter pays principle, which makes the party responsible for producing pollution responsible for paying for the damage done to the natural environment, is accepted. It has strong support in most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European Community (EC) countries. It is also known as extended producer responsibility (EPR). EPR seeks to shift the responsibility dealing with waste from governments (and thus, taxpayers and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it attempts to internalise the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically resulting in producers improving the waste profile of their products, decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for reuse and recycling.\n\nThe 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, or CLRTAP, is an early international effort to protect and gradually reduce and prevent air pollution. It is implemented by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), directed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, or Montreal Protocol (a protocol to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer), is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of numerous substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion. The treaty was opened for signature on 16 September 1987, and entered into force on 1 January 1989.\n\nGlobal dimming is the gradual reduction in the amount of global direct irradiance at the Earth's surface, which has been observed for several decades after the start of systematic measurements in the 1950s. Global dimming is thought to have been caused by an increase in particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere due to human action. It has interfered with the hydrological cycle by reducing evaporation and may have reduced rainfall in some areas. Global dimming also creates a cooling effect that may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.\n\nAlong with global warming, generalized climate change is an ongoing global commons concern. Although global warming is now a generally accepted scientific observation, the precise causes of global warming are still a matter of research and debate. The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international environmental treaty that sets binding obligations on industrialised countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and prevent potentially harmful anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) interference in the climate system. There are 192 parties to the convention, including 191 states and the European Union, but not all have ratified and implemented the protocol.\n\nThe eight Arctic nations Canada, Denmark ( Greenland and the Faroe Islands), Norway, the United States (Alaska), Sweden, Finland, Iceland, and Russia, are all members of the treaty organization, the Arctic Council, as are organizations representing six indigenous populations. The Council operates on consensus basis, mostly dealing with environmental treaties and not addressing boundary or resource disputes. Currently, the Antarctic Treaty and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System or ATS, regulate international relations with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only continent without a native human population. The treaty, entering into force in 1961 and currently having 50 signatory nations, sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans military activity on that continent.\n\nClimate change in the Arctic region is leading to widespread ecosystem restructuring. The distribution of species is changing along with the structure of food webs. Changes in ocean circulation appear responsible for the first exchanges of zooplankton between the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions in perhaps 800,000 years. These changes can allow the transmission of diseases from subarctic animals to Arctic ones, and vice versa, posing an additional threat to species already stressed by habitat loss and other impacts. Where these changes lead is not yet clear, but are likely to have far-reaching impacts on Arctic marine ecosystems.\n\nClimate models tend to reinforce that temperature trends due to global warming will be much smaller in Antarctica than in the Arctic, but ongoing research may show otherwise.\n\nManagement of outer space global commons has been contentious since the successful launch of the Sputnik satellite by the former Soviet Union on 4 October 1957. There is no clear boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space, although there are several standard boundary designations: one that deals with orbital velocity (the Kármán line), one that depends on the velocity of charged particles in space, and some that are determined by human factors such as the height at which human blood begins to boil without a pressurized environment (the Armstrong line).\n\nSpace policy regarding a country's civilian space program, as well as its policy on both military use and commercial use of outer space, intersects with science policy, since national space programs often perform or fund research in space science, and also with defense policy, for applications such as spy satellites and anti-satellite weapons. It also encompasses government regulation of third-party activities such as commercial communications satellites and private spaceflight as well as the creation and application of space law and space advocacy organizations that exist to support the cause of space exploration.\n\nThe Outer Space Treaty provides a basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national sovereignty. It also prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons in outer space. The treaty was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of mid-year, 2013 the treaty has been ratified by 102 states and signed by an additional 27 states.\n\nBeginning in 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have concerned the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Still, there remain no legal prohibitions against deploying conventional weapons in space and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.\n\nIn 1976 eight equatorial states (Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Congo, Zaire, Uganda, Kenya, and Indonesia) met in Bogotá, Colombia to make the \"Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries,\" also known as \"the Bogotá Declaration\", a claim to control the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country. These claims are not internationally accepted.\n\nThe International Space Station programme is a joint project among five participating space agencies: NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (RSA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), European Space Agency (ESA), and Canadian Space Agency (CSA). National budget constraints led to the merger of three space station projects into the International Space Station. In 1993 the partially built components for a Soviet/Russian space station Mir-2, the proposed American Freedom, and the proposed European Columbus merged into this multinational programme. The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The ISS is arguably the most expensive single item ever constructed, and may be one of the most significant instances of international cooperation in modern history.\n\nAccording to the original Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and the RSA, the International Space Station was intended to be a laboratory, observatory and factory in space. It was also planned to provide transportation, maintenance, and act as a staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars and asteroids. In the 2010 United States National Space Policy, it was given additional roles of serving commercial, diplomatic and educational purposes.\n\nAs a global system of computers interconnected by telecommunication technologies consisting of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government resources, it is difficult to argue that the Internet is a global commons. These computing resources are largely privately owned and subject to private property law, although many are government owned and subject to public law. The World Wide Web, as a system of interlinked hypertext documents, either public domain (like Wikipedia itself) or subject to copyright law, is, at best, a mixed good.\n\nThe resultant virtual space or cyberspace, however, is often viewed as an electronic global commons that allows for as much or more freedom of expression as any public space. Access to those digital commons and the actual freedom of expression allowed does vary widely by geographical area. Management of the electronic global commons presents as many issues as do other commons. In addition to issues related to inequity in access, issues such as net neutrality, Internet censorship, Internet privacy, and electronic surveillance arise.\n\n\n\n"}

Not only did they write all their books together, they did not spend more than a day apart in their adult lives, until they were finally parted by Jules's death in 1870.\" They are known for their literary work and for their diaries, which offer an intimate view into the French literary society of the later 19th century.\n\nTheir career as writers began with an account of a sketching holiday together. They then published books on aspects of 18th-century French and Japanese art and society. Their histories (\"Portraits intimes du XVIIIe siècle\" (1857), \"La Femme au XVIIIe siècle\" (1862), \"La du Barry\" (1878), and others) are made entirely out of documents, autograph letters, scraps of costume, engravings, songs, the unconscious self-revelations of the time. In their volumes (e.g., \"Portraits intimes du XVIII siecle\"), they dismissed the vulgarity of the Second Empire in favour of a more refined age. They wrote the long \"Journal des Goncourt\" from 1851, which gives a view of the literary and social life of their time.\n\nWhen they came to write novels, it was with a similar attempt to give the inner, undiscovered, minute truths of contemporary existence. They published six novels, of which \"Germinie Lacerteux\", 1865, was the fourth. It is based on the true case of their own maidservant, Rose Malingre, whose double life they had never suspected. After the death of Jules, Edmond continued to write novels in the same style.\n\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition:\nThey are buried together (in the same grave) in Montmartre Cemetery.\n\nEdmond de Goncourt bequeathed his entire estate for the foundation and maintenance of the Académie Goncourt.

{"id": "11291631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11291631", "title": "History of Icelandic", "text": "History of Icelandic\n\nThe history of the Icelandic language began in the 9th century when the settlement of Iceland, mostly by Norwegians, brought a dialect of Old Norse to the island.\n\nThe oldest preserved texts in Icelandic were written around 1100, the oldest single text being Islendingabok followed by Landnamabok. Some of the poetry, such as the Eddas, that were written down a little later nevertheless contain older language because poetic language was kept in memory unchanged over sometimes a remarkably long time. The most famous of these, written in Iceland from the 12th century onward, are without doubt the Icelandic Sagas, the historical writings of Snorri Sturluson; and eddaic poems.\n\nThe language of the era of the sagas is called Old Icelandic, a dialect of (Western) Old Norse, the common Scandinavian language of the Viking era. The Danish rule of Iceland from 1380 to 1918 had little effect on the evolution of Icelandic, which remained in daily use among the general population: Danish was not used for official communications. The same applied to English during the British (and later American) occupation of Iceland during World War II.\n\nThough Icelandic is considered more archaic than other living Germanic languages, especially in its morphology and other grammatical aspects, as well as in its lexicon, the language has nevertheless been subject to some important changes. The pronunciation, for instance, changed considerably between the 12th and 16th centuries, especially that of vowels.\n\nNevertheless, written Icelandic has changed relatively little since the 13th century. As a result of this, and of the similarity between the modern and ancient grammar, modern speakers can still understand, more or less, the original sagas and Eddas that were written some 800 years ago. This ability is sometimes mildly overstated by Icelanders themselves, most of whom actually read the Sagas with updated modern spelling and footnotes—though otherwise intact.\n\nMost of the original settlers of Iceland came from Western Norway, bringing with them the western dialect of Old Norse. Due to its geographic isolation and consequent lack of influence from other stratum languages, the development of the language was entirely independent. However, it would be wrong to suggest that the language that was brought to Iceland was completely homogeneous; even though most of the settlers were from western Norway, there were a number from other parts of the country and also from other Scandinavian countries. Therefore the language that grew up in Iceland was influenced by all of the Norwegian dialects of the time. The close intermingling of the people of the island, especially at the \"Alþingi\" (the general meeting that took place at the beginning of each summer at \"Þingvellir\") contributed to even out the differences between the various dialects: traits common to all dialects were reinforced, while the most marked differences gradually disappeared. Although it is not known exactly how the language developed, modern Icelandic has evolved less than other Scandinavian languages. The unique development of Icelandic, which eventually resulted in its complete separation from Norwegian and the other Scandinavian languages, began with the \"landnám\" or first settlement. Icelandic has lost all trace of the tonal nature of early Scandinavian languages, traces of which are noticeable in modern Norwegian and especially Swedish. Research has been carried out to identify certain traits of the language, for example the so-called \"preaspiration\", but the results were inconclusive. Icelandic shares such characteristics with two other languages: Faroese and the Swedish spoken in Finland.\n\nThe period from 550 to 1050 is called the Scandinavian or 'Common Nordic' period. During this time, a notably unified common language was spoken throughout Scandinavia. The key position of Denmark as the focal point of the whole area meant that the language was often simply called 'Danish' (\"dǫnsk tunga\"). Even though the first hints of individual future developments were already identifiable in different parts of the vast region, there were no problems with mutual intelligibility.\n\nWith regard to the \"dǫnsk tunga\" spoken in Iceland, there are no written documents from this period. Ancient Scandinavian runes were certainly widely known but were never used to write on papyrus (except Codex Runicus). They were designed as a sacred alphabet to be engraved into stone, metal or wood. In Iceland few runic inscriptions have been found and nearly all are dated after 1200.\n\nThe period from 1050 to 1350 is known as \"Old Scandinavian\", \"Old Nordic\" or \"Norse\". There are numerous manuscripts and documents dating from this period, which allows researchers to characterize Icelandic from this period accurately. \n\nAll of the documents use the Latin alphabet, which was introduced to Iceland in the 12th century. Laws were transcribed onto vellum for the first time in 1117–1118. The first manuscripts among those still in our possession date back to the second half of the 12th century. Sometime on the later half of the 12. century the First Grammatical Treatise (\"Fyrsta Málfrœðiritgerðin\") was composed, a highly original description of the language unique in Europe at the time. The treatise was concerned with the sounds of the language; it described the internal workings of the phonological system in much the same way as modern linguistic methodology. The manuscript, today kept in Reykjavík at the \"Handritastofnun Íslands\" ('Manuscript Institute of Iceland') is a later copy of the original text. Three other grammatical treaties were composed in the following decades.\n\nAlthough the oldest manuscripts date back to around 1150, they show structures that were in use from around 900. This is particularly true of the ancient epic poetry, which, due to its metric structure and oral tradition, conserved notably archaic forms. Between 1050 and 1350 Icelandic began to develop independently from other Scandinavian and Germanic languages; it is particularly conservative in its inflectional morphology and notably homogeneous across the country. From the manuscripts it has not been possible to determine whether dialects ever existed in Iceland; all indications suggest that from the outset the language has maintained an extraordinary level of homogeneity.\n\nAround 1300, the Danish language saw a very rapid evolution in both its phonology and its morphology. Given that changes to a spoken language are often only recorded later in the written language, it is probable that in spoken Danish these changes occurred around 1250 and perhaps even earlier. The rapid evolution of Danish (a simplification comparable to that seen between Old English and Middle English) gave rise to a marked difference between the north and south of Scandinavia. In 1350 Danish assumed characteristics that are still seen in the language today.\n\nNorwegian and Swedish developed more slowly, but show equally notable differences from Icelandic, which is always more conservative and has maintained even to this day many common Scandinavian features.\n\nIn Norwegian a kind of vocalic harmony developed, in which a syllable after a stressed syllable with a high vowel () exhibited only a high vowel (\"systir\" 'sister', cf. Icelandic \"systir\"), while a syllable after a stressed syllable with a mid vowel () showed only a mid vowel (\"broþer\" \"brother\", cf. Icelandic \"bróðir\"). Such innovation was only accepted in eastern Norwegian and in Swedish (Mod. Norwegian, Swedish \"bro[de]r\"), while in Icelandic there is no trace of it.\n\nWith regard to consonants, Continental Scandinavian languages and most other Germanic languages lost the series of fricatives , which were retained only in Icelandic and English (which shows here a notably archaic phonological trait). They were replaced with the corresponding dentals ( Norwegian, Swedish \"tung\" \"heavy\" \"smed\" \"smith\", cf Icelandic \"þungr\", \"smiðr\" (modern Icelandic \"þungur\", \"smiður\").\n\nIcelandic is the only Germanic language to have conserved the word-initial consonant sequences , at least from a graphic point of view (their pronunciation is in part modified by the desonoration of the second consonantal element): Icelandic \"hljóð\", \"hrafn\", \"hneta\", cf English \"loud\", \"raven\", \"nut\", Swedish \"ljud\", \"ramn\" (toponymic only), \"nöt\", German \"Laut\", \"Rabe\", \"Nuss\".\n\nAgain along with English, Icelandic is unusual among Germanic languages to have conserved, if only at a local level, the pronunciation of the word-initial consonantal cluster : Icelandic \"hvað\", \"hvalur\" , more commonly . In English \"what\", \"whale\", the is only pronounced in certain dialects. The other Germanic languages have consonantized the cluster: German \"was\", \"Wal-fisch\" , Dutch \"wat\", \"wal-vis\", Swedish \"vad\", \"val[fisk]\". Until the early years of the 20th century Swedish maintained the orthography in words such as \"hvad, hvalfisk\", which is purely historical. In Danish one writes but does not pronounce : \"hvad\", \"hval-fisk\" , while in Nynorsk, in some cases, one writes and pronounces (\"kva\"), exactly as is usual in modern Icelandic (southern dialect and literary). There are also indications that was originally pronounced .\n\nAn important vocalic development, also from a morphological standpoint, was the disappearance of word-final \"-r\" with the addition of epenthetic , written as : Old Icelandic \"akr, gestr, merkr, þú gefr\" became Modern Icelandic \"akur, gestur, merkur, þú gefur\".\n\nIn the old language the verbs forming past tense with the dental suffix (corresponding to -d in english) were apart in 1. & 3. person, ending with -a in 1. person but -i in 3. person. The 1. person took the form of the 3. person and are now identical. This is the only alteration in person inflection from the old language, here in stark contrast to the other scandinavian languages where they vanished completely and halfed in Faroese.\n\nThe current spelling of the language is unchanged from about 1300. In discussing the development of the language it is usually most convenient to divide it into two sections where the changes prior to the current spelling are outlined in the former and later changes in another. In the period from 1350 to 1550, coinciding with the total loss of independence and Danish rule, the difference between Norwegian and Icelandic grew even larger. Norway also fell to the Danish Crown, and Danish became its official language, which led to the formation of a hybrid Dano-Norwegian language, the basis of the modern Bokmål (successfully \"re-Norwegianized\" only in the 20th century). Only in western Norway (whence came the original settlers of Iceland) were the dialects kept relatively pure and free from Danish influence, so much so that in the second half of the 19th century the linguist Ivar Aasen created an authentic Norwegian idiom on the basis of them, first called \"landsmål\" \"national language\" and later \"nynorsk\" or \"neo-Norwegian\", which obtained immediate recognition as an official language of the state and is now particularly used in Western Norway. All the continental Scandinavian languages evolved in this period from more synthetic to more analytic languages, and with the Reformation begin to assume a modern character. However Icelandic in this period shows a dichotomy. On the one hand it retained, practically unaltered, its rich inflectional morphology; on the other it underwent a phonological reorganization comparable in its scope to the development from Middle English to Modern English. To cite only the most important changes:\n\nThe digraph -\"au\" which in the old language signified the same thing it does in Spanish & German (as ow in how) changed to -öí similar tu germau -eu (oi) but -ö in stead of -o.\n\nDespite this phonetic 'earthquake', some very ancient and fundamental characteristics were retained, like the conservation of word-final unaccented vowels , elsewhere reduced to an indistinct schwa ; as stated, this is probably the principal cause of the morphological conservation.\n\nAround 1550, with the Lutheran Reformation, the introduction of printing and the consequent translation of the Bible, modern Icelandic was definitively formed. Compared to other Scandinavian and Germanic languages (with the partial exception of Faroese and German), Icelandic certainly remained at an earlier evolutionary stage in terms of its morphology, but this should not imply that the language did not change; the phonological developments of the language from the ancient to the modern language are enormous. A conservative writing system, rich inflectional morphology and a lexicon that is resistant to loanwords (instead preferring neologisms formed from native material) obscures the true nature of modern Icelandic, which is a modern language like any other; Russian, Polish and Hungarian, as examples, have a morphological system at least as complex as that of Icelandic, and Hungarian, moreover, behaves exactly like Icelandic in terms of its acceptance of most loanwords. As is often said of Icelandic people, they have no difficulty in reading works of medieval literature, but to speak to their ancestors they would probably need an interpreter. The most consistent changes have been that to the vowel system, which followed the segmental phonological quantity in the 16th century or perhaps as early as the 14th century, and the consequent development of diphthongs. In the consonant system there have also been notable changes, for example the desonorization of plosives, the rise of a correlative sonorant for nasals and liquids (pre-stopping) and preaspiration.\n\nThe modern Icelandic alphabet has developed from a standard established in the 19th century primarily by the Danish linguist Rasmus Rask. It is ultimately based heavily on an orthographic standard created in the early 12th century in a mysterious document known as The \"First Grammatical Treatise\" by an anonymous author who has later been referred to as the 'First Grammarian'. The later Rasmus Rask standard was basically a re-enactment of the old treatise, with some changes to fit concurrent Germanic conventions, such as the exclusive use of \"k\" rather than \"c\". Various old features, like \"ð\", had actually not seen much use in the later centuries, so Rask’s standard constituted a major change in practice. Later 20th century changes include most notably the adoption of \"é\", which had previously been written as \"je\" (reflecting the modern pronunciation), and the abolition of \"z\" in 1973.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the Icelandic authorities implemented a stringent policy of linguistic purism. Under this policy, some writers and terminologists were put in charge of the creation of new vocabulary to adapt the Icelandic language to the evolution of new concepts, without resorting to borrowed neologisms as in many other languages. A few old words that had fallen into disuse were updated to fit in with the modern language, and neologisms were created from Old Norse roots. For example, the word \"rafmagn\" (\"electricity\") literally means \"amber power\" – a calque of the Greek \"elektron\" (\"amber\"); similarly the word \"sími\" (\"telephone\") originally meant \"wire\", and \"tölva\" (\"computer\") combines \"tala\" (\"digit\"; \"number\") and \"völva\" (\"female fortuneteller\").\n\nEven though the vast majority of Icelandic toponyms are native and clearly interpretable (for example \"Ísa-fjörður\" \"ice fjord\", \"Flat-ey\" \"flat island\", \"Gull-foss\" \"golden waterfall\", \"Vatna-jökull\" \"water glacier\", \"Reykja-vík\" \"bay of smoke\", \"Blanda\" \"the mixed (river)\" (which is formed by the confluence of different rivers), \"Varm-á\" \"hot river\") there are some that up to now have resisted any plausible interpretation, even in the light of the Celtic languages. For example, \"Esja\" (a mountain on Kjalarnes), \"Ferstikla\" (a farm near Hvalfjörður), \"Vigur\" (an island in Ísafjarðardjúp), \"Ölfus\" (an area of Árnessýsla, traversed by the river Hvíta-Ölfusá), \"Tintron\" (a volcanic crater in Lyngdalsheiði), \"Kjós\" (the area that gives its name to Kjósarsýsla), \"Bóla\" (a farm in Skagarfjörður) and \"Hekla\" (the most famous Icelandic volcano). Such toponyms pose numerous problems, but the main one can be stated in a very simple question: if they are neither Icelandic nor Celtic, which language do they come from? Perhaps they have been taken from a language (or languages) of unknown ethnicity, or perhaps (and this is a fascinating though highly improbably hypothesis) these names are a sign that Iceland was already inhabited not only before the \"landnám\", but even preceding the arrival of the first Irish hermits. But who were these people? Some scholars, such as Árni Óla, have concerned themselves with the question, attempting to demonstrate this hypothesis, which would force a complete rewrite of Icelandic history. Others have asserted that since Icelandic is an imported language, such names could in reality be traced back to some unknown substrate of Norwegian (comparisons have consequently been made with Northern Sami and other Uralic languages), and have therefore been transplanted to the island by colonists who originated from parts of Norway where such substrate languages would have still been present. Naturally, there have been numerous attempts to explain the names in terms of Icelandic: \"Kjós\", for example, could come from the root of the verb \"kjósa\", and therefore mean \"the chosen land\"; moreover, there is also the common Norwegian surname \"Kjus\". \"Bóla\" could be simply \"ból\" \"dwelling, habitation\", from the root of the verb \"búa\" \"inhabit\", present in many names of farms such as \"Aðal-ból\" \"main farm\".\n\nThe efforts of the government in Copenhagen to make Danish the official language of Iceland have left in their wake many Danish terms in official documents, but they have little lasting success. The rural population remained faithful to their own ancestral language, while Danish borrowings were used only by a restricted class of ageing educated people who were heavily influenced by Danish culture and lived only in Reykjavík. So when the battle for the purification of Icelandic from all Danicisms began in the 19th century, the groundwork had already been laid. The purification campaign was such a success that Danish borrowings were almost completely eliminated. Only a few terms by now stable in the spoken and administrative language survive, like \"ske\" \"happen\" (cf. Danish \"ske\", corresponding to German \"ge-schehen\"), \"fordæma\" \"pass sentence\", (cf. Danish \"fordømme\"), the adverbs \"kannske\" (more commonly \"kannski\") and \"máske\" \"perhaps, maybe\" (cf. Danish \"kanske, måske\", lit. \"can happen\") and some nouns like \"blýantur\" \"pencil, crayon\", \"fangelsi\" \"prison\" and \"frímerki\" \"postage stamp\" (cf. Danish \"blyant, fængsel, frimærke\").\n\nThese influences are very slight and most notable in simple names that have been comoner in Iceland than elsewhere in Scandinavia over the centuries, Njall - Niel, Brjann, Brian, Kaðlín - Kathleen, Patrekur - Patrik, Konall (as in O'Connel), Trostan - Tristan, Kormákur - Cormack.\n\nInfluences of other languages are relatively insignificant. Certainly, many terms of Latin origin are present in Icelandic, but these date back to the common Germanic period and are present in all the other Germanic languages. For example \"kaupa\" \"to buy\" < Latin \"caupō\", \"pappír\" \"paper\" (German \"Papier\", English \"paper\" < Latin \"papyrus\") and \"keisari\" \"emperor\" (German \"Kaiser\", Swedish \"kejsare\" < Latin \"Cæsar\").\n\nLatin borrowings dating back to the introduction of Christianity include \"kredda\" \"creed, dogma\" (< Latin \"credo\") and \"predika\" \"prophesy, preach\" (< Latin \"prædicare\"; cf. German \"predigen\"); more recently the very common \"náttúra\" \"nature\", \"persóna\" \"person\" (originally Etruscan, one of the few remaining words in use of that language) and \"partur\" \"part\". With regard to modern languages, Icelandic has been influenced (in recent times quite heavily) only by English, particularly in the technical lexis and by the younger generation. In languages such as Italian, English words are simply borrowed just as they are; in contrast, in Icelandic they are adapted to the local phonetic and morphological system. For example, \"pönkarar\" and \"rokkarar\" (\"punk rockers\" and just plain \"rockers\") who play \"á parketi diskótekanna\" \"on the parquet of the discothèques\".\n\n"}

As with surveys among spoken languages, surveys among sign languages have studied multilingualism, attitudes about various languages both spoken and signed (Ciupek-Reed 2012), differences and similarities between signed varieties (Aldersson and McEntee-Atalianis 2007, Bickford 1991, 2005, Parks 2011), and assessing the vitality of signed languages, and initial descriptions of undocumented sign languages.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1460121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1460121", "title": "Old Irish", "text": "Old Irish\n\nOld Irish (; ; ; ; sometimes called Old Gaelic) is the name given to the oldest form of the Goidelic languages for which extensive written texts are extant. It was used from 600 to 900. The primary contemporary texts are dated 700–850; by 900 the language had already transitioned into early Middle Irish. Some Old Irish texts date from the 10th century, although these are presumably copies of texts composed at an earlier time period. Old Irish is thus forebear to Modern Irish, Manx, and Scottish Gaelic.\n\nOld Irish is known for having a particularly complex system of morphology and especially of allomorphy (more or less unpredictable variations in stems and suffixes in differing circumstances) as well as a complex sound system involving grammatically significant consonant mutations to the initial consonant of a word. Apparently, neither characteristic was present in the preceding Primitive Irish period, though initial mutations likely existed in a non-grammaticalized form in the prehistoric era. Much of the complex allomorphy was subsequently lost, but the sound system has been maintained with little change in the modern languages.\n\nContemporary Old Irish scholarship is still greatly influenced by the works of a small number of scholars active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as Rudolf Thurneysen (1857–1940) and Osborn Bergin (1873–1950).\n\nNotable characteristics of Old Irish compared with other old Indo-European languages, are:\n\nOld Irish also preserves most aspects of the complicated Proto-Indo-European (PIE) system of morphology. Nouns and adjectives are declined in three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter); three numbers (singular, dual, plural); and five cases (nominative, vocative, accusative, dative and genitive). Most PIE noun stem classes are maintained (\"o\"-, \"yo\"-, \"ā\"-, \"yā\"-, \"i\"-, \"u\"-, \"r\"-, \"n\"-, \"s\"-, and consonant stems). Most of the complexities of PIE verbal conjugation are also maintained, and there are new complexities introduced by various sound changes (see below).\n\nOld Irish was the only member of the Goidelic/Gaelic branch of the Celtic languages, which is, in turn, a subfamily of the wider Indo-European language family that also includes the Slavonic, Italic/Romance, Indo-Aryan and Germanic subfamilies, along with several others. Old Irish is the ancestor of all modern Goidelic languages: Modern Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx.\n\nA still older form of Irish is known as Primitive Irish. Fragments of Primitive Irish, mainly personal names, are known from inscriptions on stone written in the Ogham alphabet. The inscriptions date from about the 4th to the 6th centuries. Primitive Irish appears to have been very close to Common Celtic, the ancestor of all Celtic languages, and it had a lot of the characteristics of other archaic Indo-European languages.\n\nRelatively little survives in the way of strictly contemporary sources. They are represented mainly by shorter or longer glosses on the margins or between the lines of religious Latin manuscripts, most of them preserved in monasteries in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, France and Austria, having been taken there by early Irish missionaries. Whereas in Ireland, many of the older manuscripts appear to have been worn out through extended and heavy use, their counterparts on the Continent were much less prone to the same risk because once they ceased to be understood, they were rarely consulted.\n\nThe earliest Old Irish passages may be the transcripts found in the Cambrai Homily, which is thought to belong to the early 8th century. The Book of Armagh contains texts from the early 9th century. Important Continental collections of glosses from the 8th and 9th century include the Würzburg Glosses (mainly) on the Pauline Epistles, the Milan Glosses on a commentary to the Psalms and the St Gall Glosses on Priscian's Grammar.\n\nFurther examples are found at Karlsruhe (Germany), Paris (France), Milan, Florence and Turin (Italy). A late 9th-century manuscript from the abbey at Reichenau, now in St. Paul in Carinthia (Austria), contains a spell and four Old Irish poems. The \"Liber Hymnorum\" and the \"Stowe Missal\" date from about 900 to 1050.\n\nIn addition to contemporary witnesses, the vast majority of Old Irish texts are attested in manuscripts of a variety of later dates. Manuscripts of the later Middle Irish period, such as the Lebor na hUidre and the Book of Leinster, contain texts, which are thought to derive from written exemplars in Old Irish now lost and retain enough of their original form to merit classification as Old Irish.\n\nThe preservation of certain linguistic forms current in the Old Irish period may provide reason to assume that an Old Irish original directly or indirectly underlies the transmitted text or texts.\n\nThe consonant inventory of Old Irish is shown in the chart below. The complexity of Old Irish phonology is from a four-way split of phonemes inherited from Primitive Irish, with both a fortis–lenis and a \"broad–slender\" (velarised vs. palatalised) distinction arising from historical changes. The sounds are the broad lenis equivalents of broad fortis ; likewise for the slender (palatalised) equivalents. (However, most sounds actually derive historically from .)\n\nSome details of Old Irish phonetics are not known. may have been pronounced or , as in Modern Irish. may have been the same sound as or . The precise articulation of the fortis sonorants is unknown, but they were probably longer, tenser and generally more strongly articulated than their lenis counterparts , as in the Modern Irish and Scottish dialects that still possess a four-way distinction in the coronal nasals and laterals. and may have been pronounced and respectively. The difference between and may have been that the former were trills while the latter were flaps. and were derived from an original fortis–lenis pair.\n\nOld Irish had distinctive vowel length in both monophthongs and diphthongs. Short diphthongs were monomoraic, taking up the same amount of time as short vowels, while long diphthongs were bimoraic, the same as long vowels. (This is much like the situation in Old English but different from Ancient Greek whose shorter and longer diphthongs were bimoraic and trimoraic, respectively: vs. .) The inventory of Old Irish long vowels changed significantly over the Old Irish period, but the short vowels changed much less.\n\nThe following short vowels existed:\n\nThe short diphthong may have existed very early in the Old Irish period/but not later on.\n\nArchaic Old Irish (before about 750) had the following inventory of long vowels:\n\nBoth and were normally written \"é\" but must have been pronounced differently because they have different origins and distinct outcomes in later Old Irish. stems from Proto-Celtic *ē (< PIE *ei), or from \"ē\" in words borrowed from Latin. generally stems from compensatory lengthening of short *e because of loss of the following consonant (in certain clusters) or a directly following vowel in hiatus. It is generally thought that was higher than . Perhaps was while was . They are clearly distinguished in later Old Irish, in which becomes \"ía\" (but \"é\" before a palatal consonant). becomes \"é\" in all circumstances. Furthermore, is subject to \"u\"-affection, becoming \"éu\" or \"íu\", while is not.\n\nA similar distinction may have existed between and , both written \"ó\", and stemming respectively from former diphthongs (*eu, *au, *ou) and from compensatory lengthening. However, in later Old Irish both sounds appear usually as \"úa\", sometimes as \"ó\", and it is unclear whether existed as a separate sound any time in the Old Irish period.\n\nLater Old Irish had the following inventory of long vowels:\n\nEarly Old Irish and merged in later Old Irish. It is unclear what the resulting sound was, as scribes continued to use both \"aí\" and \"oí\" to indicate the merged sound. The choice of in the table above is somewhat arbitrary.\n\nThe distribution of short vowels in unstressed syllables is a little complicated. All short vowels may appear in absolutely final position (at the very end of a word) after both broad and slender consonants. The front vowels and are often spelled \"ae\" and \"ai\" after broad consonants, which might indicate a retracted pronunciation here, perhaps something like and . All ten possibilities are shown in the following examples:\n\nThe distribution of short vowels in unstressed syllables, other than when absolutely final, was quite restricted. It is usually thought that there were only two allowed phonemes: (written \"a\", \"ai\", \"e\" or \"i\" depending on the quality of surrounding consonants) and (written \"u\" or \"o\"). The phoneme tended to occur when the following syllable contained an *ū in Proto-Celtic (for example, \"law\" (dat.) < PC *\"dligedū\"), or after a broad labial (for example, \"book\"; \"domun\" \"world\"). The phoneme occurred in other circumstances. The occurrence of the two phonemes was generally unrelated to the nature of the corresponding Proto-Celtic vowel, which could be any monophthong: long or short.\n\nLong vowels also occur in unstressed syllables. However, they rarely reflect Proto-Celtic long vowels, which were shortened prior to the deletion (syncope) of inner syllables. Rather, they originate in one of the following ways:\n\nStress is generally on the first syllable of a word. However, in verbs it occurs on the second syllable when the first syllable is a clitic (the verbal prefix \"as-\" in \"as·beir\" \"he says\"). In such cases, the unstressed prefix is indicated in grammatical works with a following centre dot (·).\n\nAs with most medieval languages, the orthography of Old Irish is not fixed, so the following statements are to be taken as generalisations only. Individual manuscripts may vary greatly from these guidelines.\n\nThe Old Irish alphabet consists of the following eighteen letters of the Latin alphabet:\n\nIn addition, the acute accent and the superdot are used as diacritics with certain letters:\n\nSome digraphs are also used:\n\nThe following table indicates the broad pronunciation of various consonant letters in various environments:\n\nNotes:\n\nThe slender (palatalised) variants of the above consonants occur in the following environments:\n\nAlthough Old Irish has both a sound and a letter \"h\", there is no consistent relationship between the two. Vowel-initial words are sometimes written with an unpronounced \"h\", especially if they are very short (the preposition \"in\" was sometimes written ) or if they need to be emphasised (the name of Ireland, , was sometimes written ). On the other hand, words that begin with the sound are usually written without it: \"her gold\". If the sound and the spelling co-occur, it is by coincidence, as \"it is not\".\n\nAfter a vowel or \"l\", \"n\", or \"r\" the letters \"c, p, t\" can stand for either voiced or voiceless stops; they can also be written double with either value:\n\nGeminate consonants appear to have existed at the beginning of the Old Irish period but were simplified by the end, as is generally reflected by the spelling generally although double \"ll\", \"mm\", \"nn\", \"rr\" were eventually repurposed to indicate nonlenited variants of those sounds in certain positions.\n\nAfter a vowel the letters \"b\", \"d\", \"g\" stand for the fricatives or their slender equivalents:\n\nAfter \"m\", \"b\" is a stop, but after \"d\", \"l\" and \"r\", it is a fricative:\n\nAfter \"n\" and \"r\", \"d\" is a stop:\n\nAfter \"n\", \"l\", and \"r\", \"g\" is usually a stop, but it is a fricative in a few words:\n\nAfter vowels \"m\" is usually a fricative, but sometimes a (nasal) stop, in which case it is also often written double:\n\nThe digraphs \"ch\", \"ph\", \"th\" do not occur in word-initial position except under lenition, but wherever they occur, they are pronounced .\n\nThe letters \"l\", \"n\", and \"r\" are generally written double when they indicate the tense sonorants, single when they indicate the lax sonorants. Originally, it reflected an actual difference between single and geminate consonants, as tense sonorants in many positions (such as between vowels or word-finally) developed from geminates. As the gemination was lost, the use of written double consonants was repurposed to indicate tense sonorants. Doubly written consonants of this sort do not occur in positions where tense sonorants developed from non-geminated Proto-Celtic sonorants (such as word-initially or before a consonant).\n\nWritten vowels \"a\", \"ai\", \"e\", \"i\" in poststressed syllables (except absolutely word-finally) all seem to represent phonemic . The particular vowel that appears is determined by the quality (broad vs. slender) of the surrounding consonants and has no relation to the etymological vowel quality:\n\nIt seems likely that spelling variations reflected allophonic variations in the pronunciation of .\n\nOld Irish was affected by a series of phonological changes that radically altered its appearance compared with Proto-Celtic and older Celtic languages (such as Gaulish, which still had the appearance of typical early Indo-European languages such as Latin or Ancient Greek). The changes were such that Irish was not recognized as Indo-European at all for much of the 19th century. The changes must have happened quite rapidly, perhaps in only one or two hundred years around 500–600, because almost none of the changes are visible in Primitive Irish (4th to 6th centuries), and all of them are already complete in archaic Old Irish (8th century). A capsule summary of the most important changes is (in approximate order):\n\n\nThey led to the following effects:\n\nThe following are some examples of changes between Primitive Irish and Old Irish.\n\nThese various changes, especially syncope, produced quite complex allomorphy, because the addition of prefixes or various pre-verbal particles (proclitics) in Proto-Celtic changed the syllable containing the stress: According to the Celtic variant of Wackernagel's law, the stress fell on the second syllable of the verbal complex, including any prefixes and clitics. By the Old Irish period, most of this allomorphy still remained, although it was rapidly eliminated beginning in the Middle Irish period.\n\nAmong the most striking changes are in prefixed verbs with or without pre-verbal particles. With a single prefix and without a proclitic, stress falls on the verbal root, which assumes the \"deuterotonic\" (\"second-stressed\") form. With a prefix and also with a proclitic, stress falls on the prefix, and the verb assumes the \"prototonic\" (\"first-stressed\") form. Rather extreme allomorphic differences can result:\n\nThe following table shows how these forms might have been derived:\n\nThe most extreme allomorphy of all came from the third person singular of the -subjunctive because an athematic person marker was used, added directly onto the verbal stem (formed by adding directly onto the root). That led to a complex word-final cluster, which was deleted entirely. In the prototonic form (after two proclitics), the root was unstressed and thus the root vowel was also deleted, leaving only the first consonant:\n\nIn more detail, syncope of final and intervocalic syllables involved the following steps (in approximate order):\n\nAll five Proto-Celtic short vowels (, , , , ) survived into Primitive Irish more or less unchanged in stressed syllables.\n\nHowever, during the runup to Old Irish, several mutations (umlauts) take place. Former vowels are modified in various ways depending on the following vowels (or sometimes surrounding consonants). The mutations are known in Celtic literature as \"affections\" or \"infections\" such as these, the most important ones:\n\nNominal examples (reconstructed forms are Primitive Irish unless otherwise indicated):\n\nVerbal paradigm example:\n\nThe result of -affection and -affection is that it is often impossible to distinguish whether the root vowel was originally or ( < and < have identical declensions). However, note the cases of vs. above for which -affection, but not -affection, was blocked by an intervening .\n\nProto-Celtic long vowels and diphthongs develop in stressed syllables as follows:\n\nThe Old Irish diphthongs , , stem from earlier sequences of short vowels separated by *, e.g. \"druid\" < \"tree-knower\".\n\nMost instances of and in nonarchaic Old Irish are due to compensatory lengthening of short vowels before lost consonants or to the merging of two short vowels in hiatus: ‘hundred’ < Proto-Celtic (cf. Welsh ) < PIE .\n\nSee Proto-Celtic for various changes that occurred in all the Celtic languages, but these are the most important:\n\nFrom Proto-Celtic to Old Irish, the most important changes are these:\n\nOld Irish preserves, intact, most initial clusters unlike many other Indo-European languages.\n\nPreserved initial clusters:\n\nModified initial clusters:\n\nMany intervocalic clusters are reduced, becoming either a geminate consonant or a simple consonant with compensatory lengthening of the previous vowel. During the Old Irish period, geminates are reduced to simple consonants, occurring earliest when adjacent to a consonant. By the end of the Old Irish period, written are repurposed to indicate the non-lenited sounds when occurring after a vowel and not before a consonant.\n\nCluster reduction involving :\n\nCluster reduction involving :\n\nLenited stops generally disappear before sonorants , with compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel.

Welsh ).\n\nOld Irish is a fusional, nominative-accusative, and VSO language.\n\nNouns decline for 5 cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, prepositional, vocative; 3 genders: masculine, feminine, neuter; 3 numbers: singular, dual, plural. Adjectives agree with nouns in case, gender, and number. The prepositional case is called the dative by convention.\n\nVerbs conjugate for 3 tenses: past, present, future; 3 aspects: simple, perfective, imperfective; 4 moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative; 2 voices: active, and passive; independent, and dependent forms; and simple, and complex forms. Verbs display tense, aspect, mood, voice, and sometimes portmanteau forms through suffixes, or stem vowel changes for the former four. Proclitics form a verbal complex with the core verb, and the verbal complex is often preceded by preverbal particles such as (negative marker), (interrogative marker), (perfective marker). Direct object personal pronouns are infixed between the preverb and the verbal stem. Verbs agree with their subject in person and number. A single verb can stand as an entire sentence. Emphatic particles such as -sa and -se are affixed to the end of the verb.\n\nPrepositions inflect for person and number, and different prepositions govern different cases, sometimes depending on the semantics intended.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46557114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46557114", "title": "P.T. (video game)", "text": "P.T. (video game)\n\nP.T. (acronym for \"playable teaser\") is a first-person psychological horror video game developed by Kojima Productions, under the pseudonym \"7780s Studio\", and published by Konami. The game was directed and designed by Hideo Kojima, in collaboration with film director Guillermo Del Toro.\n\nReleased for the PlayStation 4 on 12 August 2014 as a free download on the PlayStation Network, \"P.T.\" served primarily as an interactive teaser for the game \"Silent Hills\", a cancelled installment in the \"Silent Hill\" series. After the cancellation, Konami removed \"P.T.\" from the PlayStation Store and eliminated re-installing the game, a decision that later spawned criticism and fan efforts to allow \"P.T.\" to be re-downloaded.\n\n\"P.T.\" received critical acclaim for its direction, visuals, story complexity, and its supernatural horror tension build, but was both criticized and acclaimed for the puzzles and solutions.\n\nUnlike the third-person perspective in \"Silent Hill\" games, \"P.T.\" uses a first-person perspective, which centers on an unknown protagonist, whom the player controls, who awakens in a haunted suburban house and experiences supernatural occurrences. Available areas to explore in the home consist of an L-shaped corridor with two rooms adjacent to it: a bathroom, and a staircase which leads to the room in which the player starts a loop, or a continuous reincarnation of the corridor. The only actions the player can use are walking and zooming. To progress, the player must investigate frightening events and solve cryptic puzzles. Each time a loop is successfully completed, changes appear in the corridor. Additionally, the player encounters a hostile ghost named Lisa. If she catches the protagonist, the player has a random chance of triggering a startling jump scare when turning the camera horizontally and is sent back to the beginning of the current loop.\n\nAfter the player solves the final puzzle, a cryptic and unrevealed puzzle that allows the player to escape, a trailer reveals that \"P.T.\" is a \"playable teaser\" for a new game in the \"Silent Hill\" series, called \"Silent Hills\", directed by Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro, with the protagonist portrayed by Norman Reedus.\n\n\"P.T.\" centers on an unnamed protagonist who awakens in a concrete-lined room and opens a door to a haunted corridor, in which he can only walk through a hallway which continuously loops and redecorates itself. The first time he passes, a radio reports on a familicide, which was committed by the father and later mentions two other cases exactly like it.\n\nLater on, the protagonist encounters a hostile and unstable female apparition, presumably named Lisa. Upon entering the bathroom and being locked inside, he obtains a flashlight and finds a creature resembling an underdeveloped fetus crying in the sink. He soon gets out but finds out that the apparition is watching him. While it is possible to avoid the ghost completely, if the protagonist is attacked by the ghost he reawakens in the first room of the game, beginning the loop again. In this room there is a bloody moving paper bag that speaks to him, telling him of a disturbing experience and stating the same quote seen at the start of the game: \"Watch out. The gap in the door... it's a separate reality. The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?\"\n\nThe next few loops feature a refrigerator hanging from the ceiling, leaking blood. The muffled sound of a hysterically crying baby can be heard from the refrigerator, which violently shakes and moves. This happens several times, each time being more severe than the last. As it transitions, the radio issues a Swedish message referencing the 1938 radio drama \"The War of the Worlds\". In the next loop, the lamps turn completely red, the player's vision blurs, the character moves abnormally quickly, and there is a set of disturbing illusions. Eventually, the protagonist listens to a murder being committed in the bathroom through the bathroom peephole. After the audio ends, the bathroom door opens by itself and the player enters upon the fetus-like creature telling the protagonist that ten months earlier, he lost his job and turned to alcoholism. His wife then worked as a part-time cashier job to financially support the family, but the manager was sexually attracted to her, implying a motive for the familicide. The corridor then corrects itself and the protagonist eventually hears a voice uttering \"204863\" repeatedly. The player's perspective distorts, and the game displays a false crash message.\n\nWhen the game is restarted, the protagonist awakens in the beginning room and continues the loop with only the flashlight as a light source. He discovers the torn pieces of a photograph scattered throughout the hall and reassembles it in its frame. After the picture is completed and a set of tasks are done, a telephone rings and the radio's voice says \"You've been chosen.\" The protagonist sees a door unlock and leaves the building.\n\nIn the subsequent cutscene, the radio's voice remarks about having lived a life of regularity until his father killed him and his family without any creativity; he then voices his intention to return with his \"new toys\". The protagonist steps out into the streets of a deserted city and is revealed to be portrayed by Norman Reedus. The credits then reveal the nature of the Playable Teaser.\n\nKojima Productions used their game engine, the Fox Engine, to develop \"P.T.\". Hideo Kojima's intention when creating \"P.T.\" was to scare people in a unique way, as well as to deliver an interactive teaser experience instead of releasing trailers and screenshots of \"Silent Hills\".\n\n\"P.T.\" was designed to take players at least a week to complete, and Kojima intended the puzzles to be very enigmatic and difficult. Despite this, a few gamers reportedly finished the game within hours after the release, surprising him. Kojima also intended for \"P.T.\" to be a mystery in order to make it a more frightening experience. There is little, if not cryptic, information given in the game on events that take place, and there are few clues as to how to solve the puzzles. He chose the corridor as the setting as opposed to \"a ruin\" because he wanted the teaser to emotionally affect the player regardless of \"cultural background\". Kojima elaborated that \"P.T.\" and \"Silent Hills\" have no canonical and direct relation, and that \"Silent Hills\" would have been enhanced by elements that were never in \"P.T.\" He based his concept of \"P.T.\" on horror films and other media that he found frightening. When creating the game, Kojima refrained from using graphic violence to build up suspense, as he felt that too many horror games rely on the trope. He wanted to elicit a more \"genuine, thoughtful and permeating\" type of fear.\n\n\"P.T.\" was originally announced at Gamescom 2014 as a demo for an eponymous mystery horror video game. It was released on 12 August 2014, on the PlayStation Network. Instead of formally announcing a new \"Silent Hill\" game, director Hideo Kojima decided to release \"P.T.\" as a game demo from a nonexistent gaming studio called 7780s Studio. In September 2014, Sony announced during its pre-Tokyo Game Show press conference that \"P.T.\" had been downloaded over a million times.\n\nErik Kain of \"Forbes\" enjoyed the game for its anxiety-inducing horror, and wrote that it succeeded as marketing for the upcoming \"Silent Hills\". David Houghton of GamesRadar praised it for its immersive, well-executed horror and for how the game's difficulty created online discourse: \"By spreading out into the real world, by forcing solutions by way of hearsay, internet whispers, and desperate, rumoured logic, it has become its own urban myth.\" \"Eurogamer\"s Jeffrey Matulef wrote that, through its emphasis on \"sound effects, visual design, choreography, and difficult to decipher enemy placements\" over traditional progress, the game became immersive and terrifying. However, the puzzles in \"P.T.\" received criticism. Klepek panned the puzzles, describing them as an \"exercise in frustration\". Matthew Reynolds of Digital Spy wrote that the final puzzle was a \"source of frustration\" which lacked a clear solution. In contrast, Matulaf stated that, while the puzzles ranged in cleverness and difficulty, they added to the horror of the game by being emotionally \"uncomfortable\".\n\n\"P.T.\" was also placed on some \"best-of\" lists in 2014. GameSpot awarded it the \"Game of the Month\" for August 2014. IGN's Marty Sliva chose \"P.T.\" as an honorable mention on his list of the best video game trailers of the year, describing it as \"one of the most interesting, gorgeous, and terrifying\" games he played that year. Another reviewer for IGN, Lucy O'Brien, described the game as \"the most genuinely frightening interactive experience in recent years\", making it her choice for game of the year. Giant Bomb gave the Best Horror Game of the year award to \"P.T.\", saying that \"\"P.T.\" reminded us what happens when unlimited resources are thrown at a horror experience.\" \"P.T.\" won \"Scariest Game\" at \"Bloody Disgusting\"s FEAR Awards. The game also won \"Innovation in Game Technology\" at the 2014 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) awards. \"Polygon\" ranked it as the tenth best game of the year, and \"Slant Magazine\"s staff ranked it as the eighth best video game of the year. Patrick Klepek of \"Kotaku\" originally listed the game as number one on a list of the ten best easily available horror games in 13 February, describing it as \"the new king of horror.\" The game was replaced by \"\" as number one when \"Silent Hills\" was cancelled and \"P.T.\" removed. In 2017, GamesRadar ranked \"P.T.\" the 4th best horror game of all time in a list of 20.\n\nReviewers have identified several themes in \"P.T.\" According to \"Eurogamer\"s Jeffrey Matulef, the game's main theme is \"cyclical mental anguish\", supported by the obscure and confusing nature of the puzzles. Danielle Riendeau of \"Polygon\" wrote that \"P.T.\" uses two primary themes from the \"Silent Hill\" series, \"a sense of family trauma and domestic violence and the duality of the 'real world' and the nightmare world.\" She suggested that \"P.T.\" and \"Eraserhead\" shared thematic content, writing that both included a crying, deformed infant and that the film's protagonist journeyed from reality into a terrifying world.\n\n\"P.T.\"s ceaselessly looping hallway has been a source of critical discussion. Rob Crossley of GameSpot wrote that it induced \"mild claustrophobia\" and \"a familiarity with your surroundings\". He remarked that while the length of the first part of the corridor worked to create tension, the design of the second part intentionally prevented the player from being able to keep everything in view, causing the player to feel vulnerable. David Houghton of GamesRadar described the looping corridor as \"the conduit for everything that it builds\", along with saying that \"it fills that structure with an unbroken feedback loop of 'horror' ... every time you leave is a monumental relief, and every simultaneous instance of returning is a moment of primal foreboding at how things might, and almost certainly will, escalate, compounded by the knowledge of the seemingly countless iterations before.\" Houghton felt that the game understood how to evoke horror by working \"within the realm of psychology\". \"Polygon\" quoted a game player who said that \"\"P.T.\"s greatest asset is its looping hallway\", elaborating that it not only invokes fear, but also \"curiosity, or a desire to know what will happen next\". Matulef said that the claustrophobic and repetitive environment displayed in the game can hypnotize the player into a sense of vulnerability.\n\nThe majority of what is said and depicted in the game is open to interpretation, leading fans to develop and discuss theories about the nature of the events that occur in the game. Let's Players Voidburger and Bob from the video-game related podcast \"The Grate Debate\" opined that the open-ended nature of the game is one of its greatest aspects. They also said that there may be something in the game that has not been discovered yet. They noted the colored lights as something they still had not figured out, and they felt that the game hinted that the radio may be the main culprit behind the father's killing. The game also contained a Swedish line in the radio describing a radio drama from 1938 being true, which gamers suggested may be a nod to Orson Welles's radio adaptation of \"The War of the Worlds\". This possible reference to alien invasions was noted as a continuation of a \"Silent Hill\" tradition of having secret endings that included aliens. Another theory commonly discussed is deciphering the identity of the player character. The fetus talking to the player character about his remembering moments \"ten months back\" seems to imply that he is the father who killed Lisa and the kids, although Voidburger and Bob believe that the player character may be the protagonist that was to be in \"Silent Hills\", as shown in the trailer following the ending of \"P.T.\"\n\nJournalists have expressed confusion about whether the game should be described as a teaser, video game, or demo. Despite ongoing debate, the game won awards for best trailer while also winning game of the month and best horror game of the year awards. While naming \"P.T.\" as an honorable mention for best trailer, Marty Sliva from IGN felt that \"P.T.\" was more of an \"interactive experimental film/puzzle game\". \"Demo\" has been one of the more common descriptions, though GameSpot was reluctant to categorize it as such. Despite it being commonly called a demo of \"Silent Hills\", there is no evidence that it was going to be a part of \"Silent Hills\" aside from the reveal of the trailer and title after the end of the game. Hideo Kojima himself explained that it was not a demo of \"Silent Hills\" and described it as a \"teaser\" in a tweet.\n\nChristopher Grant from \"Polygon\" likened \"P.T.\" to Pixar's animated shorts shown before its full-length animated feature films.\n\nFollowing news of the cancellation of \"Silent Hills\", it was announced that \"P.T.\" would be removed from the PlayStation Network on 29 April 2015. Originally, it was reported that the demo could be re-downloaded, but in May 2015 it was no longer re-downloadable from the PlayStation Store. Cancellation of the game led to criticism of Konami. Patrick Klepek from \"Kotaku\" stated \"It's fine that Konami doesn't want to make \"Silent Hills\"\" but that the deletion of \"P.T.\" was wrong since the demo had become part of gaming culture. Nick Robinson of \"Polygon\" described Konami's removal as the \"most irresponsible, cowardly decision possible\", but that the subsequent unavailability had also made the demo \"one of the coolest, most fascinating games in the history of our medium\". After the cancellation, PlayStation 4 consoles with P.T. installed were listed on eBay for over $1000; eBay later pulled the auctions down. The incident has been compared to the mass selling of iPhones containing \"Flappy Bird\" after that game's removal from the iOS App Store. Guillermo del Toro, the intended future director of \"Silent Hills\", commented on \"P.T.\"s popularity, speculating that there were people who still have a passion for the \"Silent Hill\" series.\n\n\"P.T.\" has also been alluded to in other video games. The antagonist, Lisa, made a cameo in another video game directed by Kojima, \"\" (2015). The radio monologue from the beginning of P.T. can also be found playing on a radio as an easter egg. Additionally, the first-person survival-horror video game \"Allison Road\" was heavily inspired by \"P.T.\"\n\"Allison Road\" is to take place in a haunted townhouse in the United Kingdom and feature a male protagonist who attempts to unravel the mystery behind his missing family over five nights. In the demo, some wall graffiti directly alludes to \"P.T.\" by repeating a statement made in the game. \"The Park\", a spin-off game from \"The Secret World\", has a sequence inspired by \"P.T.\", and the horror games \"Layers of Fear\" and \"Visage\" were heavily inspired by \"P.T.\" as well.\n\nIn February 2016, the YouTube channel known collectively as \"Oddest of the Odd\", released a short film titled \"Silent Hills P.T. in real life\". The film draws heavily from its source material, as an unseen protagonist explores a two-story hallway loop in the first person camera perspective. The short film was featured by IGN describing it as \"incredible\" while GameRant's Alexander Pan described the video as being \"complete with the demo's much-touted disturbing content and eerie atmosphere.\"\n\n\"\" was also compared with \"P.T.\" during its announcement at E3 2016 thanks in part to the Beginning Hour Demo, its first-person perspective, and its photo-realistic graphics. Jordan Amaro, the level designer of \"Silent Hills\" was responsible for the creation of \"Resident Evil 7\"s design and setting, although he has denied that his work on \"Resident Evil 7\" was influenced by \"P.T.\", claiming that he \"wasn’t part of the core team of \"P.T.\" and that \"Silent Hills\" would have been quite different from \"Resident Evil 7\" anyway\"\n\nOn 4 July 2018, Qimsar, a 17-year-old developer and fan of P.T., remade the playable teaser for the PC and released it for free. On 13 July 2018, Konami shut down the project due to legal issues. However, Konami offered Qimsar an internship to work with its development offices.\n"}
{"id": "40540417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40540417", "title": "Philosophy of sport", "text": "Philosophy of sport\n\nPhilosophy of sport is an area of philosophy that seeks to conceptually analyze issues of sport as human activity. These issues cover many areas, but fall primarily into five philosophical categories: metaphysics, ethics and moral philosophy, philosophy of law, political philosophy, and aesthetics. The philosophical perspective on sport originated in Ancient Greece, having experienced a revival in the latter part of the 20th century with the work of Paul Weiss and Howard Slusher.\n\nA philosophical perspective on sports incorporates its metaphysical relationships with art and play, ethical issues of virtue and fairness and more broadly sociopolitical.\n\nAncient Greece is considered the birthplace of both ancient philosophy and Olympic sport. Hellenistic philosophies hung great significance on athletic performance. A leader's athletic prowess, according to the view of the times, reflected their ability to lead. (Games of the Phaeacians in Homer's \"Odyssey\") Sport was seen as an epistemic inquiry, a methodological process by which we learn the objective truth of a person's athletic potential by actualizing it in athletic competition. Athletics as a measure of individual worth was seen as a cure to social inequality. Sport was even seen as moral education, with Plato advocating the participation of women in sport for their moral enrichment. Aristotle emphasized physical activity as an ethical responsibility. Mentions of sport were also found in the work of Plato.\n\nThe resurgence of interest in philosophy of sport was marked by Yale philosopher Paul Weiss' book publication \"Sport: A Philosophical Inquiry (1969)\", considered the first book-length text in philosophy of sport. In it, Weiss explains the dearth of work in philosophy of sport as a reflection of academic elitism. Sport was always considered vulgar or common, according to Weiss.\n\nLong before this, however, philosophical considerations of sport and physical and activity were discussed as a subset of educational reform in the late 19th century as the link between physical education and health and well-being gained appreciation among scholars. To many of the time, the health and educational benefits of physical activity were a component of public life. Inadvertently, many non-philosopher proponents of physical education took on philosophical positions on teleology, mind-body dualism and metaphysics as part of their model of human agency and personhood. In a broader context, political philosophy entered the picture as thinkers of the time, in response to pressing social and political issues of the day associated civic duty, responsible citizenship and other political features to sport. While much of the focus has been on the work done in the West, philosophers of sport acknowledge the importance of work done in the East, particularly Japan.\n\nImportant questions in philosophy of sport are concerned with the social virtues of sport, the aesthetics of sporting performances and display, the epistemology of individual and team strategy and techniques, sporting ethics, the logic of rules in sport, metaphysics of sport as a component of human nature or instinct, etc. However, some writers have composed a philosophy of sport in terms of the body, art and its intersections with generation X sports, such as bouldering, surfing, skateboarding.\n\nOther areas of intersection with contemporary areas of philosophy include philosophy of education, philosophy of law, philosophy of mind, philosophy of rules, philosophy of science, social philosophy and political philosophy.\n\nEthical issues in philosophy of sport predominantly center on athlete behavior in relation to rules of the game, other athletes, spectators, external factors such as socioeconomic issues among supporters and communities, and issues of doping.\n\nIssues of doping in sport focus on the ethics of medical intervention on athletic performance: what is acceptable versus what is not, and how boundaries can be drawn. Particular attention is given to the question of what factors ought to be taken into consideration when banning certain medical interventions.\n\nThese and other issues are usually compared and contrasted through the lenses of three significant moral theories: consequentialism, deontology and virtue ethics.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35293833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35293833", "title": "Psycho-Pass", "text": "Psycho-Pass\n\n\"Psycho-Pass\" originated from Production I.G.'s interest in making a successor to Mamoru Oshii's achievements. The series was inspired by several live-action films. Chief director Katsuyuki Motohiro aimed to explore psychological themes in society's youth using dystopian storylines. Multiple books and movies influenced \"Psycho-Pass\" with the most notable being the 1982 American science fiction film \"Blade Runner\". The series was licensed by Funimation in North America. A manga adaptation has been in serialization in Shueisha's \"Jump Square\" magazine and several novels, including an adaptation and prequels to the original story, have been published. An episodic video game adaptation called \"Chimi Chara Psycho-Pass\" was developed by Nitroplus Staffers in collaboration with Production I.G. New novels and another manga were serialized in 2014.\n\nThe first anime, \"Psycho-Pass\", has garnered critical acclaim in both Japan and the west with critics praising the characters' roles and interactions set in the dystopia. The animation has also been praised despite issues in latter episodes which required fixing in the DVD volumes of the series. On the other hand, the second series, \"Psycho-Pass 2\", received mixed critical response stemming from its heavy use of gore as well as the new villain.\n\n\"Psycho-Pass\" is set in a futuristic era in Japan where the , a powerful network of psychometric scanners, actively measures the minds and mentalities of civilised populations using a \"cymatic scan\" of the brain. The resulting assessment is called a . When the calculated likelihood of an individual committing a crime, measured by the index, exceeds an accepted threshold, he or she is pursued, apprehended, and killed if necessary by police forces. Elite officers labelled \"Enforcers\" are equipped with large handguns called \"Dominators\"special weapons that only activate when aimed at suspects with higher-than-acceptable Crime Coefficients. Enforcers are themselves selected for innately high Crime Coefficients, marking them as \"latent criminals\"; they are overseen by police Inspectors, who have the jurisdiction to shoot them with their Dominators should they pose a danger to the public.\n\nThe series starts with Shinya Kogami, an Enforcer under Akane's watch during her first mission. Akane Tsunemori is a new police Inspector at Unit One of the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division. Akane is ashamed of shooting Kogami under her watch during her first mission when she judges him a threat to an apprehended criminal's life. Kogami thanks her for intervening in what could've been a murder, which influences Akane to stay. She is accompanied by veteran Inspector Nobuchika Ginoza, a strict man who looks down on Enforcers; Tomomi Masaoka, a middle-aged Enforcer who used to be a detective; Shusei Kagari, a carefree young man who was marked as a latent criminal in childhood; and Yayoi Kunizuka, a former musician turned into a latent criminal stemming from a relationship with a terrorist. Over the course of Akane's early investigations, the group uncovers the works of Shogo Makishima, a prolific criminal mastermind. Makishima is a – he is persistently assessed as having a low crime coefficient by the Sybil System in spite of his actions and plans, thus protecting him from Dominator shots.\n\nThe Enforcers and Inspectors start hunting Makishima, who aims to destroy the society created by the Sybil System. To do this he causes riots in the city to draw the police away from the Health and Welfare Ministry's Nona Tower facility, where Sibyl is located. Akane and Kogami stop Makishima's forces while Enforcer Shūsei Kagari follows one of Makishima's allies to the tower where Bureau Chief Joshu Kasei kills Makishima's ally and Kagari to keep the true form of Sibyl a secret. Kasei tells Makishima that Sibyl is a hivemind of similarly asymptomatic individuals and wishes him to join the system but Makishima escapes. Realizing the truth behind Makishima's escape, Kogami leaves the group to kill him. Akane is later directly contacted by the Sibyl system, which orders her to capture Makishima alive. She agrees to do this on the condition that they withdraw the execution order for Kogami. Learning that Makishima plans to commit bioterrorism to weaken Japan's economy and bring the system down, the Criminal Investigation Division searches for both Makishima and Kogami. There, Makishima tries killing Ginoza but Masaoka sacrifices his life to save him. Despite Akane's efforts, Kogami kills Makishima and the former's erstwhile comrades never see him again.\n\nIn season two, Akane, now leader of a restored Unit One including rookie inspector Mika Shimotsuki, Ginoza, who is demoted to an enforcer, Yayoi and two new enforcers, Sakuya Togane and Sho Hinakawa, face a new threat in the form of Kirito Kamui, another criminal mastermind who, just like Shogo, intends to bring down the Sybil System by exploiting its flaws instead of just wreaking havoc. Skilled in avoiding all forms of detection and capable of helping his supporters to keep their Crime Coefficients low, only a very few believe that he actually exists, including Akane.\n\nThe series was directed by Naoyoshi Shiotani, written by Gen Urobuchi and features character designs by Reborn! manga artist Akira Amano. It stars Tomokazu Seki as Shinya Kogami, Kana Hanazawa as Akane Tsunemori, and Takahiro Sakurai as Shogo Makishima. \"Psycho-Pass\" originated from Production I.G.'s interest in making a successor to Mamoru Oshii's \"Ghost in the Shell\" and \"Patlabor\"; the company hired Katsuyuki Motohirowho became the series' chief directorand veteran I.G. animator Naoyoshi Shiotani to supervise direction.\n\nMotohiro wanted to return to making anime after a long hiatus but he needed a charismatic script writer. Motohiro and his staff were surprised with Gen Urobuchi's contribution to the highly acclaimed anime series, \"Puella Magi Madoka Magica\". Motohiro was fascinated by \"Madoka Magica\"; he read other works from Urobuchi, which persuaded him to talk to Urobuchi. In early 2011, Motohiro proposed to Urobuchi that the pair should work together. Early in the making of the series, Motohiro told Naoyoshi Shiotani not to make anything that could not be adapted into a live-action film.\n\nBefore work on \"Psycho-Pass\" started, Shiotani was busy working on the film \"\". As soon as his work with the film ended, Shiotani focused on the series' quality. After episode 16, which proved to be the most challenging and popular of the series, the team found themselves \"out of stamina\". The next two episodes were made by an outside team, which is reflected in several problems with the animation. In response to this, the producer of the episode said that while he expected problems, he worked to make it the best he could. Shiotani also apologized for the episode's quality. The original team continued working from episode 19 on until the finale; they decided to remake episodes 17 and 18 for their retail release.\n\nThe series was first announced in late March 2012 by Fuji TV at its Noitamina press conference. In March 2013, Shiotani stated there could be a second season if the show received enough support. Once development of the second season started, Shiotani said the new episodes are more difficult to make than those in the first season. He said, \"it's more about the show's inflexibility\" because the staff have to maintain consistency. For the second season Tow Ubukata replaced Urobuchi as main writer. Ubukata mentions he was given the idea of expanding the setting in the form of a sequel. As a result of being given the scenario of the TV series and the film, Ubukata had to write the characters' personalities. Although time of the production was short, he had the time to discuss with the first series' staff. Shiotani aided the team for the final episode which Ubukata was satisfied with.\n\nWhen hearing the comments from Atsuko Ishizuka, director of \"The Pet Girl of Sakurasou\", about the way the characters were designed first, Shiotani realized it was the opposite for his team, who had to create the setting first and then the characters because they \"are almost being played by the world\". As a result, the characters were designed by manga artist Akira Amano to balance them with the dark atmosphere by having them \"palatable and very relate-able\". The staff avoided using bright colors that would stand out. Akane Tsunemori was created as the most relatable character, who would question the setting from the audience's point of view and as the heroine who would come between the main character, Shinya Kogami, and his main rival, and enemy, Shogo Makishima. Akane's progression from an innocent newcomer to a mature and haunted person was one of the staff's main objectives.\n\nMotohiro allowed his team to use very graphic elements, even though they could reduce female viewership. He acknowledges that the series may be too violent for a younger demographic and said that he would not want his son to watch it because of its psychological brutality. He added that the team did not want to make a violent series but an \"artistic series that just happened to have some violence included in it\". About the amount of violence, Shiotani told Urobuchi, \"just let us deal with it\". Some of these violent scenes occur off-camera, but whenever a protagonist was involved the moment was developed to be memorable. The team twice had to remake scenes because the television station complained that they went \"overboard.\"\n\nMotohiro wanted the series to counter concurrent anime trends. The use of \"moe\" (slang) was banned at staff meetings because they appreciated dramas like \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" and \"Patlabor\" that focus on conflicts between male characters. As the series was \"anti-moe\", the team decided to avoid having the female lead character Akane remove her clothes and instead had Kogami do it. Nevertheless, the show attracted a female viewership because the conflict between the male characters appeared to attract the \"shonen ai\" genre fans. Although Shiotani also wanted the series to avoid romance between male characters, he believed the fight scenes between male characters unintentionally attracted female fans. The staff decided to focus on friendships rather than romantic relationships.\n\nThe series was inspired by several Western films, most notably \"L.A. Confidential\". Director Naoyoshi Shiotani cited several other influences, including \"Minority Report\", \"Gattaca\", \"Brazil\" and \"Blade Runner\"; the latter of which he compared very closely to \"Psycho-Pass\". Before the making of the series, Urobuchi insisted on using a Philip K. Dick-inspired, dystopian narrative. The psychological themes were based on the time Shiotani watched \"Lupin III\" during his childhood because he thought about adding \"today's youth trauma\" to the series. The rivalry between the main characters was based on the several dramas the staff liked. Other voice actors have been credited in the making of the series because of the ways they added traits to the characters.\n\nThe staff had problems composing an opening theme for the series until someone provided some music by Ling Tosite Sigure, who was engaged to compose the opening theme. Egoist, who composed the ending theme, had debuted on Noitamina with \"Guilty Crown\". Shiotani said they asked Egoist to record three versions of the ending theme so they could alternate them to match the episode's ending. Across the series, time limits resulted in the ending songs being removed or replaced with instrumental versions to avoid cutting scenes from the episode. When there were concerns from the producers of the songs, Tomohiro and Shiotani discussed this with them.\n\nTwo \"Psycho-Pass\" CDs were included in the second and fifth Japanese home media release of the series. The \"Psycho Pass\" original soundtrack was released by Sony Music Entertainment on May 29, 2013. It features fifty-five tracks composed by Yugo Kanno. The second original soundtrack was released on March 18, 2015. A two-volume drama CD called based on the prequel novel was released between September 25 and November 27, 2013.\n\nAs some critics have noted, \"Psycho-Pass\" explores societal and psychological themes, such as the price of living without stress, and without fear of crime. Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. But this raises the question of whether it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. For example, in the first episode, a woman is kidnapped, and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's instructions, the police are therefore prepared to kill her. But Akane steps in, refusing to accept Sibyl's verdict, and manages to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her. Consequently, this challenges the notion that the potential to commit a crime necessarily correlates with actually committing the crime. According to Anime News Network, \"We are all capable of doing bad things at timesshould we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It really all comes back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal\".\n\n\"Psycho-Pass\" further suggests that the price of living without stress includes overriding the individual's needs in favor of general social value. It is morally and socially acceptable to kill individuals who may potentially commit crimes, so long as we accept that the harm that a criminal causes to society outweighs the harm we cause to an individual who is falsely charged. In other words, the Sibyl System operates on the principles of opportunity cost and acceptable risk. But relying on the Sibyl System paradoxically creates a society which fears no crime as a whole, but individuals who personally fear the consequences of the Sibyl System's verdicts. As such, Urobuchi himself has said that one of the series' central thematic ideas is \"fear\" as seen through Shogo Makishima's feeling of being out of place - because the Sibyl System cannot recognize him for what he actually is, he feels displaced and deviant within the structure of society itself.\n\nEmotional repression is also explored in \"Psycho-Pass\". The identification of latent criminals is partially based around the avoidance of emotions that society judges to be negative, such as sadness or anger. To avoid being identified as a latent criminal, one must not feel these emotions heavily outside, where their Psycho-Pass can be scanned. Kotaku states, \"because of these scans, Psycho-Pass shows an interesting future where 'mental beauty' is as sought after as physical beauty. It is also a future where the police's job is little more than to watch the latent criminals they control—because if they did any real detective work, they might start to think like the criminals they are trying to catch and thus become latent criminals themselves.\" Many of the main characters feel nostalgia throughout the series. The many references to older literature, philosophy, music and theatre create a \"nostalgic world building for a time before psycho-passes\".\n\nThe anime series produced by Production I.G. was broadcast in Japan on Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block between October 12, 2012 and March 22, 2013. Toho started releasing the series on DVD and Blu-ray formats on December 21, 2012. The eighth and final volume was released on July 26, 2013. Funimation has licensed the series in North America and simulcast it on its website, first in Japanese, and later weekly in English. Psycho-Pass was one of three initial shows aired as a Funimation \"broadcast dub.\" A home media release was planned for March 2014. In the United Kingdom, the series is licensed by Manga Entertainment and in Australia by Madman Entertainment.\n\nOn July 6, 2013, Production I.G. president Mitsuhisa Ishikawa said at Anime Expo that production on a second season had begun. The second season, titled \"Psycho-Pass 2\", began airing in October 2014; the film was released in January 2015. Before the debut broadcast of the second season, the first seasoncondensed into 11 one-hour episodes began airing in July 2014. The fourth episode was cancelled due to similarities with a real life murder. Director Naoyoshi Shiotani apologized for this in his Twitter account. Nevertheless, Funimation streamed the episode. A Blu-ray box set was announced with a scheduled release on October 15, 2014. This set contains both the original first season broadcast and the edited one-hour rerun episodes.\n\nThe second series aired on Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block between October 10, 2014 and December 19, 2014. The series was collected in a total of five DVD and Blu-ray volumes between December 17, 2014 and April 15, 2015.\n\nOn June 12, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed \"Psycho-Pass\" among 38 anime and manga titles banned in China.\n\nIn September 2013, it was announced in the official site of Noitamina that a second season and a new-original theatrical film project was in development. The film was rated as R15+ due to its strong violence scenes including murder and human body's damage. On September 2014, the release date was announced for January 9, 2015, Urobuchi and Makoto Fukami are contributing together as the film's writers. A 30-second trailer streamed on Nico Nico Douga on September 5, 2013, showing Shinya, Akane and Ginoza. A 2-minutes trailer, the second promotional video for the film, was released on September 2013, containing footage from the original anime television series. On February, 2016, Funimation released a preview for the Dub version and announced that the film will run over 100 theaters in the United States and Canada. The theme song was performed by Ling Tosite Sigure.\n\nIn March 2018, it was announced in the livestream of Fuji TV that a three-part theatrical film project is in development, titled \"Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System\". The first film, titled , will premiere in January 25, 2019. The second film, titled , will premiere in February 15, 2019. The third film, titled , will premiere in March 8, 2019. Naoyoshi Shiotani and Yugo Kanno are reprising their roles as the director and music composer, respectively. Ryō Yoshigami wrote the screenplay for the first film, while Fukami is returning from the anime series to write the screenplays for the second and third films. Production I.G is returning for animation production and Toho is distributing.\n\nA collaboration visual with \"Godzilla: The City Mechanized for the Final Battle\" has also been developed with Akane being the \"Psycho-Pass\" character used.\n\nA manga adaptation illustrated by Hikaru Miyoshi, titled , began serialization in Shueisha's \"Jump Square\" magazine from November 2, 2012. Its first \"tankōbon\" volume was released by Shueisha on February 4, 2013. In November 2013, it was announced that 380,000 copies of the manga were shipped in Japan with three volumes. The manga had over 1 million copies in print as of December 2014.\n\nAnother manga titled premiered in the August issue of Mag Garden's \"Monthly Comic Blade\" magazine on June 30, 2014. Natsuo Sai is illustrating the series and the story is written by Midori Gotou and Production I.G. The manga is published by Dark Horse Comics in North America since November 9, 2016.\nA novelization of the series by Makoto Fukami has been published by Mag Garden in two volumes released on February 4 and April 4, 2013. Shiotani said the novels were more violent than the television series. A prequel titled was written by Aya Takaba, who worked on the television series. Before the novel was released, it was first published on the \"Noitamina Novel\" page on Noitamina's official website. The novel was released on February 4, 2013.\n\nA new series of novels focusing on four characters by Ryō Yoshigami began publication in the August issue of Hayakawa Publishing's \"S-F Magazine\" on June 25, 2014. After the serialization ends, Hayakawa Bunko JA revised the novels and published them in October 2014. Other stories will focus on Choe Gu-sung, Shusei Kagari, Yayoi Kunizuka and Shion Karanomori. Hayakawa Bunko JA also published the \"Psycho Pass Genesis\" book in December 2014, which revealed the origins of Sybil and Tonomi Masaoka's involvement.\n\nInteractive visual novels titled \"Chimi Chara Psycho-Pass\", which feature chibi versions of the series' characters in original stories, were included with Blu-ray Disc volumes of the anime and are playable on any Blu-ray playing device. In May 2014, it was announced by Anime News Network that a video game based on the series, named \"\", was being developed by 5pb. for the Xbox One; with a PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4 port announced in December 2015. The game features an original story written by Urobuchi, which takes place during the time period of the anime's first six episodes and focuses on a new set of protagonists confronting a new enemy on a remote island.NIS America has localized Psycho-Pass: Mandatory Happiness for the PlayStation 4, Vita and an exclusive PC version via Steam. It was released on September 13, 2016 in North America, and on September 16, 2016 in Europe. The Xbox One version of the game will not be localized.\n\nFuji TV producer Akitoshi Mori said \"Psycho-Pass\" was the first work under his control. Early screenings of the series at the Noitamina Shop & Café attracted few viewers, which bothered Mori. However, as the series continued, the quantity of viewers increased. By the final episode, over 1,000 people had queued to watch the finale even though the venue could only accommodate seventy people. This made Mori happy because he realized how many fans were following and supporting the show; he wanted to see a bigger audience at future screenings. DVDs and Blu-ray discs of the series achieved good sales. In April 2014, the series was nominated for the Seiun Award. In the \"Newtype\" anime awards from 2013, it was voted as fourth best title of the year. Episode 11 of the series was awarded \"Best Episode\" in the Noitamina 10th anniversary fan vote. Shinya Kogami, Akane Tsunemori and Shogo Makishima also appeared in such polls as winners of their own categories. Anime News Network also listed as the fifth most accessible anime series for people who have not watched Japanese animation.\n\nThe first season has garnered critical acclaim. Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network praised the show for its \"high level of interest\" in depicting its dystopian world. However, she said that its violent scenes were so gruesome they might scare viewers. Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis called it a \"compelling cyberpunk mystery\", praising the society depicted and the series of murders orchestrated by Shogo Makishima. However, he criticized the use of advanced technology and compared it with other science fiction films despite saying that it handled the themes better whereas Makishima's immunity to it was left unexplained. DVD Talk gave high praise to Makishima because of his achievements across the story and his personality. Certain episodes have been referred as \"filler\" because they are used as a build-up to the climactic ones. Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network gave high praise stating that from episode 12, the series was \"a real blast to watch\" and that she was glad with the development of the protagonist, Akane Tsunemori. However, she severely criticized the plot twist regarding the Sybil System's true identity calling it \"one of the stupidest revelations in the history of anime\".\n\nThomas Zoth from The Fandom Post praised the show's focus on the relationships between the protagonists and the development from these. Akane's growth across the series earned major praise by multiple reviewers. Zoth enjoyed the series' climactic action scenes between Kogami and Makishima, and the scenes portraying the status quo. He said the sixteenth episode is \"Urobuchi's masterpiece.\" Silverman commented on the parallelism between Akane's and Kogami's development, which resulted in an ambiguous ending that should be decided by the viewers. The supporting cast received similar praise by DVD Talk but the reviewer said some were underwhelming and Shion is the least-explored character.\n\nDuring the streaming of the series, Silverman criticized the animation because of the low lighting levels that might make it hard to understand. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator noted the series' high budget and praised the animation style and the focus on details and technology. She was attracted by its premise and expected the quality to remain consistent across the entire series. Similarly, Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN praised the animation for its high quality. Episode 18, which is known for its flawed animation, was improved for the home media release of the series.\n\nFeedback to \"Psycho-Pass 2\" has ranged from mixed to negative. Dan Rhodes from UK Anime Network noted that \"Psycho-Pass 2\", while entertaining, lacked the twists of the first season and appeal of Gen Urobuchi's writing. Richard Eisenbeis from Kotaku praised the origins of the Sybil System which was unexplained in the first season. While also praising the differences between Akane and the new Inspector, Mika Shimotsuki, Eisenbeis criticized the new antagonist and how much gorier the series was in contrast to the first one. Nick Creamer from Anime News Network was more negative during his review as he felt the new writer, Tow Ubukata, did not make the anime appealing despite his previous enjoyable works. He went on to say \"overall, Psycho-Pass 2 stands as one of the most disappointing works I've ever watched to completion,\" citing it a failure as both a sequel and an independent series.\n\nThe first \"Psycho-Pass\" film gathered positive reactions winning the 5th \"Newtype Anime Award\" and the Japan Sci-Fi Con's Seiun Awards.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "27306472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27306472", "title": "Pulaka", "text": "Pulaka\n\nPulaka, \"Cyrtosperma merkusii\", or swamp taro, is a crop grown in Tuvalu and an important source of carbohydrates for the area's inhabitants. It is a \"swamp crop\" similar to taro, but \"with bigger leaves and larger, coarser roots.\" \nThe same plant is known as babai in Kiribati, \"puraka\" in Cook Islands, \"pula’a\" in Samoa, \"via kan\" in Fiji, Pulaka in Tokelau, \"simiden\" in Chuuk, \"swam taro\" in Papua New Guinea, and \"navia\" in Vanuatu.\n\nPulaka roots need to be cooked for hours to reduce toxicity in the corms, but are rich in nutrients, especially calcium. Pulaka is an important part of Tuvalu cultural and culinary tradition, now under threat from rising sea level and displacement from the growing use of imported food products.\n\nThe crop is grown in pits dug into the limestone atoll and is fertilized by adding leaves from different plants. The plants derive water from the freshwater lens found a few meters below the atoll. For this reason the cultivation of pulaka is threatened by rising sea levels caused by global warming: the plant does not thrive in the salt water which seeps into the pits: it rots the roots, turns the leaves yellow, and stunts the plant's growth. These saltwater intrusions occur more often now that the high tides have become higher, and more frequently flood the islands. To alleviate the problem of saltwater pollution, some islanders have begun to line the pits, side and bottom, with cement.\n\nPulaka makes up the bulk of the islanders' traditional diet; it is usually supplemented by fish. Since the unprocessed corms are toxic, they must always be cooked, usually in an earth oven. Many of the recipes call for the addition of coconut cream or toddy, or both. On Niutao, coconut cream (\"lolo\") is poured over beaten pulp of pulaka, to make a dish called \"tulolo\". A similar dish on Nukufetau, with halved corms, is called \"tulolo pulaka\"; with beaten corms the dish is called \"fakapapa\". \"Fekei\" is made on all the islands, and consists of pulaka which is grated (typically this is done by the women) with the aid of limestone with holes drilled in it. The resulting pulp is wrapped in pulaka leaves and steamed, and mixed with coconut cream.\n\nPreserving any food on the islands is difficult because of the hot climate. Pulaka is usually preserved by burying it in the ground, and it will keep up to three months. Cooks take baked pulaka corms and slice them to dry them in the sun; after six days of drying, the slices (\"pulaka valuvalu\") are packed in coconut containers and hung from roof beams, and will keep up to seven years. The dried substance can be cooked in coconut cream and water to create a dish called \"likoliko\". On Nukufetao, \"puatolo\" is a dish made from grated pulaka and toddy, baked in the oven; when dried in the sun it will keep for three months.\n\nThe pits are dug and maintained by individual families over generations and have great cultural and personal significance: \"The ownership and cultivation of the pulaka pits is an important part of family identity, cultural pride and survival. Encroachment of the salt water into the pulaka pit threatens the future of the people of Tuvalu.\" In addition, the secrets of producing the crop are often transferred from father to son, and when a father teaches his son how to plant pulaka, he is \"practicing how to live like a man.\"\n\nBesides rising saltwater levels, \"changing lifestyles and eating habits\" also threaten the cultivation of the crop, a process that began during and after World War II, when American occupying troops supplied the islands with imported foods and many pits were no longer maintained. Imported foods are often high in sugar, leading also to an increase in the need for dental care and diabetes.\n"}

{"id": "39502824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39502824", "title": "Sharing economy", "text": "Sharing economy\n\nSharing economy is an umbrella term with a range of meanings, often used to describe economic activity involving online transactions. Originally growing out of the open-source community to refer to peer-to-peer based sharing of access to goods and services, the term is now sometimes used in a broader sense to describe any sales transactions that are done via online market places, even ones that are business to business (B2B), rather than peer-to-peer. For this reason, the term \"sharing economy\" has been criticized as misleading, some arguing that even services that enable peer-to-peer exchange can be primarily profit-driven. However, many commentators assert that the term is still valid as a mean of describing a generally more democratized marketplace, even when it's applied to a broader spectrum of services. Alternatively, collaborative consumption or the sharing economy refers rather to resource circulation systems which allow a consumer two-sided role, in which consumers may act as both providers of resources or obtainers of resources. The exchange may be performed directly on a peer-to-peer basis, or indirectly through a mediator (ex. store, website, app); online or offline; for free or for other compensation (ex. money, points, services, etc.). This vision allows for a broader understanding of the sharing economy on the overarching criteria of consumer changing role capacity.\n\nShared Economy is also known as collaborative consumption or collaborative economy or peer economy. It refers to a hybrid market model of a peer-to-peer exchange\n\nThe sharing economy may take a variety of forms, including using information technology to provide individuals with information that enables the optimization of resources through the mutualization of excess capacity in goods and services.\n\nCollaborative consumption as a phenomenon is a class of economic arrangements in which participants mutualize access to products or services, in addition to finding original ways to individual ownership. The phenomenon stems from an increasing consumer desire to be in control of their consumption instead of \"passive 'victims' of hyperconsumption\".\nThe consumer peer-to-peer rental market is valued at $26bn (£15bn), with new services and platforms emerging frequently.\n\nThe collaborative consumption model is used in online marketplaces such as eBay as well as emerging sectors such as social lending, peer-to-peer accommodation, peer-to-peer travel experiences, peer-to-peer task assignments or travel advising, carsharing or commute-bus sharing.\n\nThe \"Harvard Business Review\", the \"Financial Times\" and many others have argued that \"sharing economy\" is a misnomer. Harvard Business Review suggested the correct word for the sharing economy in the broad sense of the term is \"access economy\". The authors say, \"When \"sharing\" is market-mediated—when a company is an intermediary between consumers who don't know each other—it is no longer sharing at all. Rather, consumers are paying to access someone else's goods or services.\".\n\nAccording to sharing economy expert Alex Stephany, it is a mystery as to who first used the term \"sharing economy\", which has left the term \"without a guardian and vulnerable to loose definitions\".\n\nA variety of definitions exist. \"The people who share\" is one of the broadest definitions, which encompasses the on-demand economy, the gig economy, social media, and a great deal else. Academic definitions tend to be narrower, limiting the sharing economy to only peer-to-peer transactions, and sometimes further limiting the definition to only peer-to-peer transactions that relate to the temporary exchange of physical goods. Another set of narrow definitions used by free culture activists, members of the co-operative movement and similar, excludes for-profit companies from the sharing economy, even if they facilitate just peer-to-peer transactions. Sometimes called the \"real\" or \"true\" sharing economy, organisations that operate within such definitions are mostly small and localist, run by volunteers on a cooperative basis, though sometimes also by governments and municipal authorities. They can include some organisations that operate without online transactions, such as bike kitchens. The \"true\" sharing economy does include some large internationally available web sites however, such as Freecycle.\n\nThe term \"sharing economy\" has been widely used since about 2010, yet according to a Pew survey taken in winter 2015, only 27% of Americans had heard of the term.\n\nSurvey respondents who had heard of the term had divergent views on what it meant, with many thinking it concerned \"sharing\" in the traditional sense of the term. In 2010 and 2011, many people involved with the sharing economy did indeed consider it to be about sharing in the traditional sense. A commonly used example at the time was the idea of sharing a power drill—a tool that many consumers might use for only a few minutes in their lifetime. Advocates said it made sense for regular consumers not to buy their own power drill, but to borrow from others instead, and that this borrowing could be facilitated by online platforms. Several startups companies were launched to help people share drills and similar goods along these lines. Yet looking back from 2015, it was clear that consumers had generally not been interested in such temporary exchanges, leading to the failure of many startups which aimed to facilitate traditional sharing. While some successful platforms such as Airbnb or CanYa can be described as involving the sharing of a resource, as of 2016 the term \"sharing economy\" has been widely criticised as being misleading.\n\nThe scope of the sharing economy has been a subject of academic debate. Depending on the criteria used, some platforms would be included within the sharing economy, but not others. For example, going by whether companies self-describe as being part of the sharing economy, TaskRabbit would be included, but not mechanical Turk.\n\nCommercial implementations encompass a wide range of structures including mostly for-profit, and, to a lesser extent, co-operative structures. The sharing economy provides expanded access to products, services and talent beyond one-to-one or singular ownership, which is sometimes referred to as \"disownership\". individuals actively participate as users, providers, lenders or borrowers in varied and evolving peer-to-peer exchange schemes which are often web-mediated.\n\nSeveral key macro developments led to the (re-)emergence of mutualization in consumption. The \"sharing economy\" results from several deep-seated technological, economic, political, and societal changes:\n\nThe term \"sharing economy\" began to appear in the early 2000s, as new business structures emerged due to the Great Recession, enabling social technologies, and an increasing sense of urgency around global population growth and resource depletion. Professor Lawrence Lessig was possibly first to use the term in 2008, though others claim the origin of the term is unknown.\n\nThe phenomena of the sharing economy certainly emerged much earlier than 2008 however, even in the sense of exchange co-ordinated by online platforms. One inspiration was the tragedy of the commons, which refers to the idea that when we all act solely in our self-interest, we deplete the shared resources we need for our own quality of life. The Harvard law professor Yochai Benkler, one of the earliest proponents of open source software, posited that network technology could mitigate this issue through what he called 'commons-based peer production', a concept first articulated in 2002. Benkler then extended that analysis to \"shareable goods\" in \"Sharing Nicely: On Shareable goods and the emergence of sharing as a modality of economic production\".\n\nThe term \"collaborative consumption\" was coined by Marcus Felson and Joe L. Spaeth in their paper \"Community Structure and Collaborative Consumption: A routine activity approach\" published in 1978 in the \"American Behavioral Scientist\".\n\nIn 2011, collaborative consumption was named one of \"TIME\" magazine's 10 ideas that will change the world.\n\nA recent study, using bibliometrics and network analysis, analyzed the evolution of scholarly research on collaborative consumption, and identified that this expression started in 2010 with Botsman and Rogers' (2010) book \"What's mine is yours: The rise of collaborative consumption\". The number of studies published on the subject then increased exponentially in 2014. Furthermore, there are four clusters of research: 1) exploration and conceptualization of collaborative consumption; 2) consumer behavior and marketing empiricism; 3) mutualization and sharing systems; 4) sustainability in the collaborative economy. The analysis suggests that this last cluster was under-researched in contrast to the three others, but has started to increase in importance since 2017.\n\nThe UK Government in its 2015 Budget set out objectives to improve economic growth including to make Britain the \"...best place in the world to start, invest in, and grow a business, including through a package of measures to help unlock the potential of the sharing economy...\"\n\nAlso in 2015, \"The Business of Sharing by Alex Stephany\", CEO of JustPark, was published by Palgrave Macmillan. The book features interviews with high-profile entrepreneurs such as Martin Varsavsky and venture capitalists such as Fred Wilson.\n\nThe rapid growth of the sharing economy has been frequently remarked on. Yet according to a report by the United States Department of Commerce in June 2016, quantitative research on size and growth remains sparse. Such growth estimates as there are can be challenging to evaluate due to different and sometimes unspecified definitions about what sort of activity counts as sharing economy transactions.\n\nThe June 2016 report summarised currently available research. This included a 2014 study by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which looked at five components of the sharing economy: travel, car sharing, finance, staffing and streaming. It found that global spending in these sectors totalled about $15 billion in 2014, which was only about 5% of the total spending in those areas. The report also forecasts a possible increase of \"sharing economy\" spending in these areas to $335 billion by 2025, which would be about 50% of the total spending in said five areas. A 2015 PricewaterhouseCoopers study found that nearly one-fifth of American consumers partake in some type of sharing economy activity. A 2017 report by Diana Farrell and Fiona Greig suggested that at least in the US, sharing economy growth may have peaked.\n\nOriginally, Botsman and Rogers (2010) identified three resource circulation systems within collaborative consumption, i.e. the sharing economy: product service systems, redistribution markets and collaborative lifestyles.\n\nProduct-service systems refer to commercial peer-to-peer mutualization systems (CPMS), allowing consumers to engage in monetized exchanges through peer-to-peer-based for temporary access to goods. Goods that are privately owned can be shared or rented out via peer-to-peer marketplaces. For example, BMW's \"DriveNow\" is a car rental service that offers an alternative to owning a car. Users can access a car when and where they need them and pay for their usage by the minute.\n\nA system of collaborative consumption is based on used or pre-owned goods being passed on from someone who does not want them to someone who does want them. This is another alternative to the more common 'reduce, reuse, recycle, repair' methods of dealing with waste. In some markets, the goods may be free, as on Freecycle, Zwaggle and Kashless. In others, the goods are swapped (as on Swap.com) or sold for cash (as on eBay, craigslist, and uSell).\n\nCollaborative lifestyles refer to community-based platforms, allowing consumers to engage in monetized exchanges through peer-to-peer-based for services or access to resources such as money or skills. These systems are based on people with similar needs or interests banding together to mutualize and exchange less-tangible assets such as time, space, skills, and money. The growth of mobile technology provides a platform to enable location-based GPS technology and to also provide real-time sharing.\n\nAccording to some authors, sector-specific models may stand out as specific components of the sharing economy. These models also use a two-sided marketplace to enable individuals to contribute funds to entrepreneurs, artists, civic programs and projects.\n\nThese models also use a two-sided marketplace to enable experts to provide on-demand information to consumers.\n\nMany state, local and federal governments are engaged in Open Data initiatives and projects such as data.gov and the London Data Store. The theory of open or \"transparent\" access to information enables greater innovation, and makes for more efficient use of products and services, and thus supporting resilient communities.\n\nThe Sharing Economy relies on the will of the users to share, but in order to make an exchange, users have to be trustworthy and trust each other. Sharing economy organizations say they are committed to building and validating trusted relationships between members of their community, including producers, suppliers, customers or participants. Beyond trusting others (i.e., the peers), the users of a Sharing Economy platform also have to trust the platform itself as well as the product at hand.\n\nUnused value refers to the time over which products, services and talents lay idle. This idle time is wasted value that business models and organizations that are based on sharing can potentially utilize. The classic example is that the average car is unused 92% of the time. This wasted value can be a significant resource, and hence an opportunity, for sharing economy car solutions. There is also significant unused value in \"wasted time\", as articulated by Clay Shirky in his analysis of power of \"crowds\" connected by information technology. Many people have unused capacity in the course of their day. With social media and information technology, such people can donate small slivers of time to take care of simple tasks that others need doing. Examples of these crowd sourced solutions include the for-profit Amazon Mechanical Turk and the non-profit Ushahidi.\n\nWaste is commonly considered as something that is no longer wanted and needs to be discarded. The challenge with this point of view is that much of what we define as waste still has value that, with proper design and distribution, can safely serve as \"nutrients\" for follow-on processes, unlocking new levels of value in increasingly scarce and expensive resources. One example is \"heirloom design\" as articulated by physicist and inventor Saul Griffith.\n\nThe driving forces behind the rise of sharing economy organizations and businesses include:\n\n\n\"Forbes\" estimates the revenue flowing through the shared economy would surpass $3.5 billion in 2013, with growth exceeding 25%.\n\nSuggested benefits of the sharing economy include:\n\nEncompassing many of the listed benefits of the sharing economy is the idea of the freelance worker. Through monetizing unused assets, such as renting out a spare guest room on Airbnb, or providing personal services to others, such as becoming a driver with Uber, people are in effect becoming freelance workers. Freelance work entails better opportunity for employment, as well as more flexibility for workers, as people have the ability to pick and choose the time and place of their work. As freelance workers, people can plan around their existing schedules and maintain multiple jobs if needed. Evidence of the appeal to this type of work can be seen from a survey conducted by the Freelancers Union, which shows that around 34% of the U.S. population is involved in freelance work.\n\nAccording to an article by Margarita Hakobyan, freelance work can also be beneficial for small businesses. During their early developmental stages, many small companies can’t afford or aren’t in need of full-time departments, but rather require specialized work for a certain project or for a short period of time. With freelance workers offering their services in the sharing economy, firms are able to save money on long-term labor costs, and increase marginal revenue from their operations.\n\nResearcher Christopher Koopman, an author of a study by George Mason University economists, said the sharing economy \"allows people to take idle capital and turn them into revenue sources.\" He has stated, \"People are taking spare bedroom[s], cars, tools they are not using and becoming their own entrepreneurs.\" Arun Sundararajan, a New York University economist who studies the sharing economy, told a congressional hearing that \"this transition will have a positive impact on economic growth and welfare, by stimulating new consumption, by raising productivity, and by catalyzing individual innovation and entrepreneurship\".\n\nA study in Intereconomics / The Review of European Economic Policy noted that the sharing economy has the potential to bring many benefits for the economy, while noting that this presupposes that the success of sharing economy services reflects their business models rather than 'regulatory arbitrage' from avoiding the regulation that affects traditional businesses.\n\nOne benefit of sharing economy is that it can help us in some specific scenes. For example, when your phone has less 20% battery, you may need a sharing charger. The power bank-sharing concept works as follows: Through an app, users locate a shared-charger station, scan a QR code, pay a deposit, and borrow a power bank. The battery packs can be returned to any charging station. In the case of LeDian, the company allowed customers to use the power banks free of charge for the first 24 hours after paying a 50-yuan ($7.60) deposit. After the first day, users were charged 2 yuan per day for the service.\n\nAn independent data study conducted by Busbud compared the average price of hotel rooms with the average price of Airbnb listings in thirteen major cities in the United States. The research concluded that in nine of the thirteen cities, Airbnb rates were lower than hotel rates by an average price of $34.56. A further study conducted by Busbud compared the average hotel rate with the average Airbnb rate in eight major European cities. The research concluded that the Airbnb rates were lower than the hotel rates in six of the eight cities by a factor of $72. Data from a separate study shows that with Airbnb's entry into the market in Austin, Texas hotels were required to lower prices by 6 percent to keep up with Airbnb's lower prices.\n\nUsing a personal car to transport passengers or deliveries requires payment, or sufferance, of costs for fees deducted by the dispatching company, fuel, wear and tear, depreciation, interest, taxes, as well as adequate insurance. The driver is typically not paid for driving to an area where fares might be found in the volume necessary for high earnings, or driving to the location of a pickup or returning from a drop-off point. Mobile apps have been written that help a driver be aware of and manage such costs has been introduced.\n\nUber, Airbnb, and other companies have had drastic effects on infrastructures such as road congestion and housing. Major cities such as San Francisco and New York City have become even more congested due to ride sharing. According to transportation analyst Charles Komanoff, \"Uber-caused congestion has reduced traffic speeds in downtown Manhattan by around 8 percent\".\n\n\"The New York Times\" wrote that there was a recent corporate decision by Uber which aimed at lowering its fare rates by 15% in over 100 cities in the United States. This decision caused many Uber employee drivers to assemble and express their disagreement with the recent pay cut. Uber made a statement claiming that when it cut prices previously, \"the amount of time drivers spent waiting for fares fell, meaning drivers did more business and ultimately earned more money\".\n\nA number of academics recently demonstrated that in 2015, Uber generated $6.8 billion of consumer welfare in the United States.\n\nThe sharing economy model of Uber has been replicated in other similar areas. Ride sharing economy gave birth to food and grocery delivery systems. Uber launched a food-ordering app called UberEATS which not only allows users to order food, but also enables users to register to be UberEATS drivers. Similar to Uber drivers, UberEATS drivers get paid for delivering food. An example of grocery delivery in sharing economy is Instakart. It has the same business model as that of sharing economy based companies like Uber, Airbnb, or CanYa. Instacart uses resources that are readily available, and the shoppers shop at existing grocery shops. The contract workers use their personal vehicles to deliver groceries to customers. Instacart manages to keep its cost low as it does not require any infrastructure to store goods. In addition to having contract workers, Instacart allows signing up to be a \"personal shopper\" for Instacart through its official web page.\n\nThe \"Harvard Business Review\" argues that \"sharing economy\" is a misnomer, and that the correct word for this activity is access economy. The authors say, \"When \"sharing\" is market-mediated—when a company is an intermediary between consumers who don't know each other—it is no longer sharing at all. Rather, consumers are paying to access someone else's goods or services.\" The article goes on to show that companies (such as Uber) who understand this, and whose marketing highlights the financial benefits to participants, are successful, while companies (such as Lyft) whose marketing highlights the social benefits of the service are less successful.\n\nThe notion of \"sharing economy\" has often been considered as an oxymoron, and a misnomer for actual commercial exchanges. Arnould and Rose proposed to replace the misleading concept of \"sharing\" by that of mutuality or mutualization. A distinction can therefore be made between free mutualization such as genuine sharing and for-profit mutualization in the likes of Uber, Airbnb, or Taskrabbit.\nTo Ritzer, this current trend towards increased consumer input in commercial exchanges refers to the notion of prosumption, which, as such, is not new. The mutualization of resources is for example well known in business-to-business (B2B) like heavy machinery in agriculture and forestry as well as in business-to-consumer (B2C) like self-service laundries. But three major drivers enable consumer-to-consumer (C2C) mutualization of resources for a broad variety of new goods and services as well as new industries. First, customer behaviour for many goods and services changes from ownership to sharing. Second, online social networks and electronic markets more easily link consumers. And third, mobile devices and electronic services make the use of shared goods and services more convenient (e.g. smartphone app instead of physical key).\n\n\"Salon\" writes that \"the sharing economy ... [is] not the Internet 'gift economy' as originally conceived, a utopia in which we all benefit from our voluntary contributions. It's something quite different—the relentless co-optation of the gift economy by market capitalism. The sharing economy, as practiced by Silicon Valley, is a betrayal of the gift economy. The potlatch has been paved over, and replaced with a digital shopping mall.\"\n\nOxford Internet Institute, Economic Geographer, Graham has argued that key parts of the sharing economy impose a new balance of power onto workers. By bringing together workers in low- and high-income countries, gig economy platforms that are not geographically-confined can bring about a 'race to the bottom' for workers.\n\n\"New York Magazine\" wrote that the sharing economy has succeeded in large part because the real economy has been struggling. Specifically, in the magazine's view, the sharing economy succeeds because of a depressed labor market, in which \"lots of people are trying to fill holes in their income by monetizing their stuff and their labor in creative ways\", and in many cases, people join the sharing economy because they've recently lost a full-time job, including a few cases where the pricing structure of the sharing economy may have made their old jobs less profitable (e.g. full-time taxi drivers who may have switched to Lyft or Uber). The magazine writes that \"In almost every case, what compels people to open up their homes and cars to complete strangers is money, not trust. ... Tools that help people trust in the kindness of strangers might be pushing hesitant sharing-economy participants over the threshold to adoption. But what's getting them to the threshold in the first place is a damaged economy, and harmful public policy that has forced millions of people to look to odd jobs for sustenance.\"\n\nAccording to CBS News there is also Uber's \"audacious plan to replace human drivers\" Once companies like Uber replace human drivers with driverless cars, further job loss will occur as even freelance driving will be replaced by automation.\n\nHowever, Carl Benedikt Frey found that while the introduction of Uber had not led to jobs being lost, but had caused a reduction in the incomes of incumbent taxi drivers of almost 10 percent.\n\n\"HuffPost\" wrote that some people believe the recent recession led to the expansion of the sharing economy because people could easily employ themselves through the services that these companies offer. However, this concept is only hiding the fact that such employment is only a new face for contractual work and temporary employment that doesn't provide the necessary safeguards for modern living. When companies use contract based employment, the \"advantage for a business of using such non-regular workers is obvious: It can lower labor costs dramatically, often by 30 percent, since it is not responsible for health benefits, social security, unemployment or injured workers' compensation, paid sick or vacation leave and more. Contract workers, who are barred from forming unions and have no grievance procedure, can be dismissed without notice\".\n\nXconomy wrote about the debate over the status of the workers within the sharing economy, whether they should be treated as contract workers or employees of the companies. This issue seems to be most relevant among sharing economy companies such as Uber. The reason this has become such a big issue is that the two types of workers are treated very differently. Contract workers are not guaranteed any benefits and pay can be below average. However, if they are employees, they are granted access to benefits and pay is generally higher. The State of California is trying to go after Uber and make them pay a fine to compensate workers fairly. The California Public Utilities Commission was working on a case that \"addresses the same underlying issue seen in the contract worker controversy—whether the new ways of operating in the sharing economy model should be subject to the same regulations governing traditional businesses\". Like Uber, Instakart too had to face similar lawsuits. In 2015, a lawsuit was filed against Instakart alleging the company misclassified a person who buys and delivers groceries as independent contractor. Instakart had to eventually make all such people as part-time employees and had to accord benefits such as health insurance to those qualifying. This led to Instakart having thousands of employees overnight from zero.\n\nOn the other hand, a 2015 article by economists at George Mason University argued that many of the regulations circumvented by sharing economy businesses are exclusive privileges lobbied for by interest groups. Workers and entrepreneurs not connected to the interest groups engaging in this rent-seeking behavior are thus restricted from entry into the market. For example, taxi unions lobbying a city government to restrict the number of cabs allowed on the road prevents larger numbers of drivers from entering in the marketplace.\n\nThe same research finds that while sharing economy workers do lack the protections that exist in the traditional economy, many of them cannot actually find work in the traditional economy. In this sense, they are taking advantage of opportunities which the traditional regulatory framework has not been able to provide for them. As the sharing economy grows, governments at all levels are reevaluating how to adjust their regulatory schemes to accommodate these workers.\n\nResearch by Carl Benedikt Frey found that the \"sharing economy\" has had substantial negative impacts on workers wages.\n\nAndrew Leonard, Evgeny Morozov, Bernard Marszalek, Dean Baker, and Andrew Keen criticized the for-profit sector of the sharing economy, writing that sharing economy businesses \"extract\" profits from their given sector by \"successfully [making] an end run around the existing costs of doing business\" - taxes, regulations, and insurance. Similarly, In the context of online freelancing marketplaces, there have been worries that the sharing economy could result in a 'race to the bottom' in terms or wages and benefits: as millions of new workers from low-income countries come online.\n\nSusie Cagle wrote that the benefits big sharing economy players might be making for themselves are \"not exactly\" trickling down, and that the sharing economy \"doesn't build trust\" because where it builds new connections, it often \"replicates old patterns of privileged access for some, and denial for others\". William Alden wrote that \"The so-called sharing economy is supposed to offer a new kind of capitalism, one where regular folks, enabled by efficient online platforms, can turn their fallow assets into cash machines ... But the reality is that these markets also tend to attract a class of well-heeled professional operators, who outperform the amateurs—just like the rest of the economy\".\n\nThe local economic benefit of the sharing economy is offset by its current form, which is that huge tech companies reap a great deal of the profit in many cases. For example, Uber, which is estimated to be worth $50B as of mid-2015, takes up to 30% commission from the gross revenue of its drivers, leaving many drivers making less than minimum wage. This is reminiscent of a peak Rentier state \"which derives all or a substantial portion of its national revenues from the rent of indigenous resources to external clients\".\n\n\"Business Insider\" wrote that companies such as Airbnb and Uber do not share their reputation data with the very users who it belongs to. This is an issue since no matter how well people behave on any one platform, their reputation doesn't travel with them. This fragmentation has some negative consequences, such as the Airbnb squatters who had previously deceived Kickstarter users to the tune of $40,000. Sharing data between these platforms could have prevented the repeat incident. Business Insider's view is that since the sharing economy is in its infancy, this has been accepted. However, as the industry matures, this will need to change.\n\nGiana Eckhardt and Fleura Bardhi say that the sharing economy promotes and prioritizes cheap fares and low costs rather than personal relationships, which is tied to similar issues in crowdsourcing. For example, Zipcar is advertised as a ride-sharing service, but it's been brought into consideration that the consumers reap similar benefits from Zipcar as they would from, say, a hotel. In this example, there is minimal social interaction going on and the primary concern is the low cost. Other examples many include myriad other sharing economies such as AirBnB or Uber. Because of this, the \"sharing economy\" may not be about sharing but rather about access. Giana Eckhardt and Fleura Bardhi say the \"sharing\" economy has taught people to prioritize cheap and easy access over interpersonal communication, and the value of going the extra mile for those interactions has diminished. In light of the discussion on sharing economy versus access economy, the business models of the sharing economy platforms are also under examination. The escrow-like model practiced by several of the largest sharing economy platforms, in which they facilitate and handle contracting and payments on behalf of their subscribers, further underlines an emphasis on access and transaction rather than on sharing.\n\nThe sharing economy has also caused many issues as it often becomes ambiguous as to what the workers' roles are inside of these gig companies. For example, Uber has had many issues over the debate about if their drivers are considered registered taxi drivers or independent contractors. This debate has caused Uber to have to remove their presence in several locations such as Alaska. Uber stirred up a large controversy in Alaska because if Uber drivers were considered registered taxi drivers, that would mean they would be entitled to receiving workers' compensation insurance. However, if they were considered independent contractors they would not receive these same benefits. Due to all of the disputes, Uber decided to pull their services from the Alaskan market. In addition, ride-share drivers’ status continues to be ambiguous when it comes to legal matters. On New Year’s Eve in 2013, an off-duty driver for Uber killed a pedestrian while looking for a rider. Since the driver was considered a contractor, Uber would not compensate the victim’s family. The contract states that the service is a matching platform and “the company does not provide transportation services, and … has no liability for services... provided by third parties.”\n\nIt has been discovered that sharing firms have used their power over consumers and labor for unethical business practices. In March 2017, it was shown that Uber used its platform to target regulatory officials. By using software named 'Greyball', Uber was able to make it difficult for officials to get rides on the application. Other schemes implemented by Uber include using its application to show 'phantom' cars nearby to consumers on the app, implying shorter pick-up times than could actually be expected. Uber also changes its contracts and commission clauses so much that it confuses drivers as to their terms of employment.\n\nThe sharing economy has also caused issues because many companies have skyrocketed in this new economy and have almost completely replaced the traditional companies that came before them, that offered the same services. Regulations that cover traditional taxi companies but not ride sharing services can put taxis at a competitive disadvantage. Returning to the Uber example, Uber has faced many problems worldwide due to the fact that it has taken a large chunk of customers away from traditional taxi companies. Uber has also been banned from several countries or districts including China, Taiwan, Italy, and many others. This is mainly due to the fact that countries saw the company as an unfair competition to taxi services and created laws and regulations against Uber to help benefit taxi companies.\n\nA sharing service, named \"Sharing E Umbrella\" was started in 11 cities across China in 2017 lost almost all of the 300,000 umbrellas placed out for sharing purposes during the first few weeks.\n\nThe disintermediation and informal nature of community-based platforms such as Uber and Airbnb (from the collaborative economy), may exacerbate old problems and spawn new challenges. Such platforms may indeed be ethically and morally questionable and thus constitute controversial consumption schemes. Henceforth, a study used Sykes and Matza's (1957) classic neutralization theory, from the field of criminology to identify how supporters and users of community-based platforms justify the existence of controversial consumption systems such as community-based platforms. Interestingly, to justify these platforms, suppors and users both tend to depend heaily on neutralization techniques such as appealing to higher loyalty (e.g., the good for society, the free and fair competition), condemnation of condemners (e.g. Taxi drivers in the case of Uber, hotel chains in the case of Airbnb), denial of victims (i.e., taxi drivers and hotel employees are not victims), denial of responsibility (i.e., Uber and Airbnb are not to blame, the State is), and invokation of normalcy (i.e., these platforms are going to become the norm anyway, or it is the norm in other cities or countries). Also, these techniques are used in conjunction with non-neutralization techniques to defend controversial collaborative services such as Uber.\n\nAgriculture\nFinance\nFood\nTravel\nReal estate\n\nLabor\nProperty\nTransportation\n\nGovernance\nBusiness\nTechnology\nDigital rights\nOther\n\n"}
{"id": "20634663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20634663", "title": "Some Words with a Mummy", "text": "Some Words with a Mummy\n\n\"Some Words with a Mummy\" is a satirical short story by Edgar Allan Poe. It was first published in \"\" in April 1845. \n\nDoctor Ponnonner invites the narrator to his home to take part in a mummy unwrapping. They cut into the first sarcophagus, remove it and discover the mummy's name, Allamistakeo. The second and third sarcophagi are removed to reveal the body, placed in a papyrus sheath, covered in plaster and decorated with painting and gold gilt. After removing this, they examine the body. They find it to be in exceptionally good condition, although it does not seem to have been embalmed in the normal way as the skin is red and there are no incisions.\n\nThe doctor lays out instruments for the dissection, but the men suggest using electricity on the mummy and they begin preparations for this at once. The amount of electricity causes the mummy to awaken and condemn the men for their abuse. The men make their apologies to Allamistakeo, explain to him why they dissect mummies and the scientific importance of it. Satisfied with the explanation and their apologies Allamistakeo shakes hands with the men, who then proceed to patch up the damage caused by their incisions. They gather up proper clothes for Allamistakeo and sit down for cigars and wine.\n\nAllamistakeo explains how he came to be a mummy - ancient Egyptians had a significantly longer life span than modern men - about one thousand years - they were also able to be embalmed - this process arrested the bodily functions allowing them to sleep through hundreds of years only to rise and go on with their lives centuries later. Allamistakeo again chastises the men for their ignorance of Egyptian history. He then explains that throughout time man has always been monotheistic, the pagan gods were symbols of the various aspects of the one true god. The men ask him, as he is over five thousand years old, if he knows anything about how the universe was created ten thousand years ago. Allamistakeo responds that no one during his time entertained the fantasy that the universe was ever created, but that it always existed, although, some believed that humans were created by spontaneous generation. To this Allamistakeo has to accept defeat and, in triumph, the men disperse.\n\nIn January 1845, \"Columbian Magazine\" listed \"Some Words with a Mummy\" as scheduled for publication; Poe likely pulled the article when he was offered more money for it elsewhere. It was ultimately published in the April 1845 edition of the \"American Review\", which also included Poe's revised poems \"The Valley of Unrest\" and \"The City in the Sea\". The story was republished without changes shortly after in the November 1, 1845, issue of the \"Broadway Journal\".\n\nThis story is a satire of two things. First the popular interest in Egyptology and mummies during the time that this story was written. Secondly the prevailing thought that in the West humanity had reached the height of civilization and knowledge due to the scientific and industrial revolutions.\n\nPoe is clearly poking fun at Egyptmania in this story. In the story a group of men gather together in the middle of the night to examine a mummy for the sake of \"scientific discovery\". During their examination they act like a group of children that just got a new toy. They poke and prod the mummy just to see what happens, this is evident when they decide to use electricity. The fact that this is going on at the Doctor's private residence and is attended by his friends only, even though they do not have any kind of medical expertise denotes this fact. Although it seems, in modern times, counterproductive to conduct a serious scientific examination in a party like atmosphere, this was commonly done at the time, a fact that Poe is ridiculing here. The mummy is also a method of ridicule here, right down to its name, Allamistakeo. Unlike serious mummy horror stories, the mummy is not scary, and the characters do not react to it as such. It is another device that Poe uses to censure the reader. Upon its resurrection, the mummy chastises the men for their abuse of himself and mummies in general.\n\nIn their discussion with Allamistakeo, the men attempt to exalt their time as one of unprecedented knowledge and technology. Again and again, Allamistakeo is able to prove that the technology in his time was not inferior, and often superior, to the modern equivalents. The narrator, who at first is presented as an intelligent, educated man, is later revealed to be completely ignorant. He asks Allamistakeo a series of questions intended to prove that modern technology is superior and each time he asks questions that, ultimately, support Allamistakeo's argument. Even when one of the men tries to stop him and suggests that he consult historical texts before asking his questions, he continues. When the man mentions Ptolemy, the narrator's response is \"whoever Ptolemy is\". In the end, the only reason the men can consider themselves the victors of the debate comes down to cough drops.\n\nThe story was adapted as a one-act opera, \"Allamistakeo\", by Giulio Viozzi in 1954.\n\n"}

It has evolved from Michalsky's fashion shows and takes place twice a year during Berlin Fashion Week. Since January 2010 the event is officially titled \"StyleNite\".\n\nThe event is breaking with the traditions of a conventional fashion show, by combining performances of different art disciplines. Each StyleNite is themed according to the inspirational topic of the latest collection of the designer Michalsky.\n\nMichalsky is considered a „seismograph of society\" and his collections are regularly influenced by current developments in society. These topics are picked up as central theme of the StyleNite with the aim to support a free and tolerant exchange between artists and art disciplines. In this respect, the StyleNite is considered a platform for exchange, discussion and contacts. Inherent part of the StyleNite are Michalsky's fashion shows. Alternating locations and elaborate stage-designs are setting the scene for further performances during the event. Part of the program are always live music acts of famous or newcomer bands, show performances, film premieres and fashion shows of other labels. The evening ends with an excessive after show party.\n\nIn March 2011 Michalsky announced that the following four StyleNites are going to take place at the Tempodrom in Berlin.\n\n\nMichalsky always develops an elaborate and individual stage for each StyleNite interpreting the theme of the evening. For example, the stage of the StyleNite \"The Great Depression Part II\" featured a crashed airplane in a pool and thousands of stocks on the catwalk.\n\nBesides famous models there are always new faces to be spotted at StyleNite.\n\nMichalsky has always ignored the „traditional\" requirements for models regarding age, origin and perfection. He would line up handicapped models as well as aged models on the runway at StyleNite. The engagement of the handicapped model Mario Galla at the StyleNite in July 2010 was considered almost scandalous among the fashion scene and caused enormous media response. In January 2011, the models Eveline Hall and Pat Cleveland walked the runway; both women are over 60 years old. The internationally renowned German model Toni Garrn has been a regular among the models at StyleNite for several years. In January 2013 Jimi Blue Ochsenknecht was proud to present his first run on catwalk for Michael Michalsky.\n\nThere is no official ticket sale for the event. The invitations are sent exclusively to a limited number of guests. The audience at StyleNite changes each time, consisting of people from fashion, media, politics, art and celebrities.\n\nThe organizer provides selected media - mainly fashion magazines, blogs and design journals - with a limited number of tickets that are available for raffles. In single cases tickets are given to the students of Berlin's fashion design academies.\n\nThere is a strict door policy at the night of the StyleNite.\n\nThe StyleNite is extensively covered in German and international media. In July 2011 the StyleNite was covered extensively by Chinese media for the first time. Vogue TV China broadcast a report and the \"Cosmopolitan China\" dedicated an entire page to the event. On 21 January 2012 the French-German TV station ARTE aired a 90 minutes documentary on the Michalsky StyleNite.\n\nQuotes:\n\n"}

These are the tribes of Reuben, Simeon, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Manasseh and Ephraim. Claims of descent from the \"lost\" tribes have been proposed in relation to many groups, and some religions espouse a messianic view that the tribes will return.\n\nIn the 7th and 8th centuries CE, the return of the lost tribes was associated with the concept of the coming of the messiah.\n\nThe Jewish historian Josephus (37–100 CE) wrote that \"the ten tribes are beyond the Euphrates till now, and are an immense multitude and not to be estimated in numbers\".\n\nHistorian Tudor Parfitt has declared that \"the Lost Tribes are indeed nothing but a myth\", and he writes that \"this myth is a vital feature of colonial discourse throughout the long period of European overseas empires, from the beginning of the fifteenth century, until the later half of the twentieth\".\n\nThe scriptural basis for the idea of \"10 Lost Tribes\" is 2 Kings 17:6: \"In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in the towns of the Medes.\" According to the Hebrew Bible, Jacob (who was later named Israel; Genesis 35:10) had 12 sons and at least one daughter (Dinah) by two wives and two concubines. The twelve sons fathered the twelve Tribes of Israel.\n\nThus, the two divisions of the tribes are:\n\nAccording to the Bible, the Kingdom of Israel (or Northern Kingdom) was one of the successor states to the older United Monarchy (also called the Kingdom of Israel), which came into existence in about the 930s BCE after the northern Tribes of Israel rejected Solomon's son Rehoboam as their king. Nine landed tribes formed the Northern Kingdom: the tribes of Reuben, Issachar, Zebulun, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Ephraim, and Manasseh. In addition, some members of the Tribe of Levi, who had no land allocation, were found in the Northern Kingdom. The Tribes of Judah and Benjamin remained loyal to Rehoboam, and formed the Kingdom of Judah (or the Southern Kingdom). Members of Levi and the remnant of Simeon were also found in the Southern Kingdom.\n\nAccording to , members of the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon \"fled\" to Judah during the reign of Asa of Judah (c. 911–870 BCE). Whether these groups were absorbed into the population or remained distinct groups or returned to their tribal lands is not indicated.\n\nIn c. 732 BCE, the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III sacked Damascus and Israel, annexing Aramea and territory of the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Manasseh in Gilead including the desert outposts of Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab. People from these tribes, including the Reubenite leader, were taken captive and resettled in the region of the Khabur River system in Assyria/Mesopotamia. Tiglath-Pilesar also captured the territory of Naphtali and the city of Janoah in Ephraim, and an Assyrian governor was placed over the region of Naphtali. According to and , the population of Aram and the annexed part of Israel was deported to Assyria.\n\nIsrael continued to exist within the reduced territory as an independent kingdom subject to Assyria until around 725–720 BCE, when it was again invaded by Assyria and the rest of the population deported. The Bible relates that the population of Israel was exiled, leaving only the Tribe of Judah, the Tribe of Simeon (that was \"absorbed\" into Judah), the Tribe of Benjamin, and the people of the Tribe of Levi who lived among them of the original Israelite tribes in the southern Kingdom of Judah. However, Israel Finkelstein estimated that only a fifth of the population (about 40,000) were actually resettled out of the area during the two deportation periods under Tiglath-Pileser III, Shalmaneser V, and Sargon II. Many also fled south to Jerusalem, which appears to have expanded in size fivefold during this period, requiring a new wall to be built, and a new source of water (Siloam) to be provided by King Hezekiah. Furthermore, explicitly mentions northern Israelites who had been spared by the Assyrians—in particular, members of Dan, Ephraim, Manasseh, Asher, and Zebulun—and how members of the latter three returned to worship at the Temple in Jerusalem at that time.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible does not use the phrase \"ten lost tribes\", leading some to question the number of tribes involved. states that the kingdom would be taken from Solomon and ten tribes given to Jeroboam:\nAccording to Zvi Ben-Dor Benite:\n\nCenturies after their disappearance, the ten lost tribes sent an indirect but vital sign ... In 2 Esdras, we read about the ten tribes and \"their long journey through that region, which is called Arzareth\" ... The book of the \"Vision of Ezra\", or Esdras, was written in Hebrew or Aramaic by a Palestinian Jew sometime before the end of the first century CE, shortly after the destruction of the temple by the Romans. It is one of a group of texts later designated as the so-called Apocrypha—pseudoepigraphal books attached to but not included in the Hebrew biblical canon.\n\nSome evidence exists of a continuing identification in later centuries of individual Israelites to the Lost Tribes. For example, in of the New Testament, an individual is identified with the tribe of Asher.\n\nThere are discussions in the Talmud as to whether the ten lost tribes will eventually be reunited with the Tribe of Judah; that is, with the Jewish people. In the Talmud, the Sanhedrin equate the exile of the lost tribes with being morally and spiritually lost. In Tractate Sanhedrin 110B, Rabbi Eliezer states:\n\nJust like a day is followed by darkness, and the light later returns, so too, although it will become 'dark'. for the ten tribes, G‑d will ultimately take them out of their darkness.\nIn the Jerusalem Talmud, Rabbi Shimon ben Yehudah, of the town of Acco, states in the name of Rabbi Shimon:\n\nIf their deeds are as this day's, they will not return; otherwise they shall.\n\nThe increased currency of tales relating to lost tribes that occurred in the 17th century was due to the confluence of several factors. According to Parfitt:As Michael Pollack shows, Menasseh's argument was based on \"three separate and seemingly unrelated sources: a verse from the book of Isaiah, Matteo Ricci's discovery of an old Jewish community in the heart of China and Antonio Montezinos' reported encounter with members of the Lost Tribes in the wilds of South America\".\n\nIn 1649 Menasseh published his book, \"The Hope of Israel\", in Spanish and in Latin in Amsterdam; it included Montezinos' account of the Lost Tribes in the New World. An English translation was published in London in 1650. In it Menasseh argued, and for the first time tried to give learned support in European thought and printing, to the theory that the native inhabitants of America at the time of the European discovery were actually descendants of the [lost] Ten Tribes of Israel. Menasseh noted how important Montezinos' account was, \nHe wrote on 23 December 1649: \"I think that the Ten Tribes live not only there ... but also in other lands scattered everywhere; these never did come back to the Second Temple and they keep till this day still the Jewish Religion ...\"\n\nIn 1655, Menasseh ben Israel petitioned Oliver Cromwell to allow the Jews to return to England in furtherance of the Messianic goal. (Since the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, Jews had been prohibited by law from living in England.) With the approach of 1666, considered a significant date, Cromwell was allegedly interested in the return of the Jews to England because of the many theories circulating related to millennial thinking about the end of the world. Many of these ideas were fixed upon the year 1666 and the Fifth Monarchy Men who were looking for the return of Jesus as the Messiah; he was expected to establish a final kingdom to rule the physical world for a thousand years. Messianic believers supported Cromwell's Republic in the expectation that it was a preparation for the \"fifth monarchy\"—that is, the monarchy that should succeed the Babylonian, Persian, Greek, and Roman world empires.\n\nApocryphal accounts concerning the Lost Tribes, based to varying degrees on biblical accounts, have been produced by both Jews and Christians since at least the 17th century. An Ashkenazi Jewish tradition speaks of these tribes as \"Die Roite Yiddelech\", \"the little red Jews\", cut off from the rest of Jewry by the legendary river Sambation, \"whose foaming waters raise high up into the sky a wall of fire and smoke that is impossible to pass through\".\n\nHistorians generally concluded that the groups referred to as the Lost Tribes merged with the local population. For instance, the \"New Standard Jewish Encyclopedia\" states: \"In historic fact, some members of the Ten Tribes remained in Palestine, where apart from the Samaritans some of their descendants long preserved their identity among the Jewish population, others were assimilated, while others were presumably absorbed by the last Judean exiles who in 597–586 BC were deported to Assyria ... Unlike the Judeans of the southern Kingdom, who survived a similar fate 135 years later, they soon assimilated ...\"\n\nThe Book of Mormon is based on the premise that two families of Israelites escaped from Israel shortly before the sacking of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar and that they constructed a boat, crossed the Atlantic Ocean, and arrived in the New World as founders of Native American tribes and eventually the Polynesians. Adherents believe the two founding tribes were called Nephites and Lamanites, that the Nephites were white and practiced Christianity, and that the Lamanites were rebellious and received dark skin from God as a mark to separate the two tribes. Eventually the Lamanites wiped out the Nephites around 400 AD, leaving only dark skinned Native Americans. The descent of Native Americans from Israel is a key part of Mormonism's foundational beliefs. For example, Native American followers are almost always declared to be of the house of Manasseh when receiving Patriarchal Blessings, which purport to reveal ethnic lineage.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) believes in the literal gathering of Israel, and the LDS Church actively preaches the gathering of people from the twelve tribes. \"Today Israelites are found in all countries of the world. Many of these people do not know that they are descended from the ancient house of Israel,\" the church teaches in its basic \"Gospel Principles\" manual. \"The Lord promised that His covenant people would someday be gathered ... God gathers His children through missionary work. As people come to a knowledge of Jesus Christ, receiving the ordinances of salvation and keeping the associated covenants, they become 'the children of the covenant' (3 Nephi 20:26).\"\n\nThe church also teaches that \"The power and authority to direct the work of gathering the house of Israel was given to Joseph Smith by the prophet Moses, who appeared in 1836 in the Kirtland Temple... The Israelites are to be gathered spiritually first and then physically. They are gathered spiritually as they join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and make and keep sacred covenants... The physical gathering of Israel means that the covenant people will be “gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise” (2 Nephi 9:2). The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh will be gathered in the Americas. The tribe of Judah will return to the city of Jerusalem and the area surrounding it. The ten lost tribes will receive from the tribe of Ephraim their promised blessings (see D&C 133:26–34). . . The physical gathering of Israel will not be complete until the Second Coming of the Savior and on into the Millennium (see Joseph Smith—Matthew 1:37).\"\n\nOne of their main Articles of Faith, written by Joseph Smith, is as follows: \"We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.\" (LDS Articles of Faith #10)\n\nRegarding the Ezekiel 37 prophecy, the church teaches that the \"Book of Mormon\" is the stick of Ephraim (or Joseph) mentioned and that the Bible is the stick of Judah, thus comprising two witnesses for Jesus Christ. The church believes the \"Book of Mormon\" to be a collection of records by prophets of the ancient Americas, written on plates of gold and translated by Joseph Smith c. 1830. The church considers the \"Book of Mormon\" one of the main tools for the spiritual gathering of Israel.\n\nExpanded exploration and study of groups throughout the world through archeology and the new field of anthropology in the late 19th century led to a revival or reworking of accounts of the Lost Tribes. For instance, because archeological finds of the Mississippian culture's complex earthwork mounds seemed beyond the skills of the Native American cultures known to European Americans at the time of their discovery, it was theorized that the ancient civilizations involved in the mounds' construction were linked to the Lost Tribes. They tried to fit new information into a biblical construct. However, the earthworks across North America have been conclusively linked to various Native groups, and most archaeologists now consider the theory of non-Native origin to be pseudo-science.\n\nAfter learning about normative Judaism in the 19th century, the Bene Israel often migrated from villages in Konkan to nearby cities, which included Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad, and Karachi. Based on Bene Israel tradition, after centuries of traveling through Western Asia from Israel, their ancestors migrated to India and slowly assimilated into the surrounding community, while maintaining particular Jewish traditions. David Rahabi, an Indian Jew, found the Bene Israel in the 18th century and took note of their Jewish customs. Some historians note that the ancestors of the Bene Israel belonged to one of the Lost Tribes of Israel; however, Jewish authorities have not officially recognized the Bene Israel as one of the Lost Tribes. In 1964 the Israeli Rabbinate ruled that the Bene Israel are \"full Jews in every respect\".\n\nThe \"Report of the High Level Commission on the Indian Diaspora\" (2012) reviewed life in Israel for the Bene Israel community. It noted that the city of Beersheba in Southern Israel has the largest community of Bene Israel, with a sizable one in Ramla. They have a new kind of transnational family. Generally the Bene Israel have not been politically active and have had modest means. They have not formed continuing economic connections to India and have limited political status in Israel. Jews of Indian origin are generally regarded as Sephardic; they have become well integrated religiously with the Sephardhim community in Israel.\n\nSince the late 20th century, some tribes in the Indian North-Eastern states of Mizoram and Manipur claim they are Lost Israelites and have been studying Hebrew and Judaism. The chief rabbi of Israel ruled in 2005 that the Bnei Menashe was recognized as part of a lost tribe, allowing aliyah after formal conversion.\n\nThe Beta Israel (\"House of Israel\") are Ethiopian Jews, who were also called \"Falashas\" in the past. Some members of the Beta Israel, as well as several Jewish scholars, believe that they are descended from the lost Tribe of Dan, as opposed to the traditional story of their descent from the Queen of Sheba. They have a tradition of being connected to Jerusalem. Early DNA studies showed that they were descended from Ethiopians, but in the 21st century, new studies have shown their possible descent from a few Jews who lived in either the 4th or 5th century, possibly in Sudan. The Beta Israel made contacts with other Jewish communities in the later 20th century. In 1973 Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, then the Chief Sephardic Rabbi, based on the Radbaz and other accounts, ruled that the Beta Israel were Jews and should be brought to Israel; two years that opinion was confirmed by a number of other authorities who made similar rulings, including the Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi Shlomo Goren.\n\nThe Igbo Jews of Nigeria claim descent variously from the tribes of Ephraim, Naphtali, Menasseh, Levi, Zebulun and Gad. \nThe theory, however, does not hold up to historical scrutiny. Historians have examined the historical literature on West Africa from the colonial era and they have elucidated diverse functions that such theories served for the writers who proposed them.\n\nThe Pashtuns are a predominantly Muslim Iranic people, native to Afghanistan and Pakistan, who adhere to a pre-Islamic indigenous religious code of honor and culture, Pashtunwali. The myth about Pashtuns being from the lost tribes of Israel has never been substantiated through concrete historical evidence. Many members of the Taliban hail from the Pashtun tribes and they do not necessarily disclaim their alleged \"Israelite\" descent.\n\nThe tribal name 'Yusef Zai' in Pashto translates as the \"sons of Joseph\"\n\nA number of genetic studies refute the possibility of a connection, whereas others maintain a link.\n\nIn 2010, \"The Guardian\" reported that the Israeli government was planning to fund a genetic study in order to test the veracity of a genetic link between the Pashtuns and the lost tribes of Israel. The article stated \"Historical and anecdotal evidence strongly suggests a connection, but definitive scientific proof has never been found. Some leading Israeli anthropologists believe that, of all the many groups in the world who claim a connection to the 10 lost tribes, the Pashtuns, or Pathans, have the most compelling case.\"\n\nThe Sefwi tribe in Ghana had a history of some Judaic practices, including observing the Sabbath, circumcision at eight days (brit milah), a rite of manhood at 13 years, observing laws of family purity (taharat mishpacha or niddah). In 1977 a member of the tribe, Aaron Ahotre Toakyirafa had a vision that he was Jewish and part of a lost tribe of Israel. Some scholars believe the Jewish customs likely represent Jews who were part of the expulsion from Spain in 1492 who migrated south from Morocco. The community became known as the \"House of Israel\".\n\nAdherents of British Israelism and their heirs, the Christian Identity movement, believe that the lost tribes migrated northward, over the Caucuses, and became the Scythians, Cimmerians and Goths, and progenitors of the later invaders of Britain.\n\nThe theory arose in England, whence it spread to the United States. During the 20th century, British Israelism was promoted by Herbert W. Armstrong, founder of the Worldwide Church of God.\n\nTudor Parfitt, author of \"The Lost Tribes: The History of a Myth\", states that the proof cited by adherents of British Israelism is \"of a feeble composition even by the low standards of the genre\", and these notions are widely rejected by historians.\n\nIn 1650, a British minister named Thomas Thorowgood, who was a preacher in Norfolk, published a book entitled \"Jewes in America or Probabilities that the Americans are of that Race\", which he had prepared for the New England missionary society. Parfitt writes of this work: \"The society was active in trying to convert the Indians but suspected that they might be Jews and realized they better be prepared for an arduous task. Thorowgood's tract argued that the native population of North America were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes.\"\n\nIn 1652 Sir Hamon L'Estrange, an English author writing on topics such as history and theology published an exegetical tract called \"Americans no Jews, or improbabilities that the Americans are of that Race\" in response to the tract by Thorowgood. In response to L'Estrange, Thorowgood published a second edition of his book in 1660 with a revised title and included a foreword written by John Eliot, a Puritan missionary to the Indians who had translated the Bible into an Indian language.\n\nSome writers have speculated that the Japanese people may be the direct descendants of some of the Ten Lost Tribes. Parfitt writes that \"the spread of the fantasy of Israelite origin ... forms a consistent feature of the Western colonial enterprise...It is in fact in Japan that we can trace the most remarkable evolution in the Pacific of an imagined Judaic past. As elsewhere in the world, the theory that aspects of the country were to be explained via an Israelite model was introduced by Western agents.\n\nIn 1878, Scottish immigrant to Japan Nicholas McLeod self-published \"Epitome of the Ancient History of Japan\".\n\nMcLeod drew correlations between his observations of Japan and the fulfillment of biblical prophecy: The civilized race of the Aa. Inus, the Tokugawa and the Machi No Hito of the large towns, by dwelling in the tent or tabernacle shaped houses first erected by Jin Mu Tenno, have fulfilled Noah's prophecy regarding Japhet, \"He shall dwell in the tents of Shem.\"\n\nJon Entine emphasizes that DNA evidence shows that there are no genetic links between Japanese and Israelite people.\n\nThe Lemba people (Vhalemba) from Southern Africa claim to be the descendants of several Jewish men who traveled from what is now Yemen to Africa in search of gold, where they took wives and established new communities. They have specific religious practices similar to those in Judaism and a tradition of being a migrant people, with clues pointing to an origin in West Asia or North Africa. According to the oral history of the Lemba, their ancestors were Jews who came from a place called Sena several hundred years ago and settled in East Africa. Sena is an abandoned ancient town in Yemen, located in the eastern Hadramaut valley, which history indicates Jews inhabited in past centuries. Some research suggests that \"Sena\" may refer to Wadi Masilah (near Sayhut) in Yemen, often called Sena, or alternatively to the city of Sana'a, also located in Yemen.\n\n\n"}

Therefore, to upgrade the industry and the development of the country, the government planned to take on ten massive building projects. They were proposed by the Premier Chiang Ching-kuo, beginning in 1974, with a planned completion by 1979.

{"id": "23550175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23550175", "title": "The Boy with the Leaking Boot", "text": "The Boy with the Leaking Boot\n\nThe Boy with the Leaking Boot is a statue showing a young boy, with a bare right foot, holding up his right boot and looking at it. The statue is about tall, and in many cases forms a fountain, with water emerging from the toe of the boot. There are at least 24, and reportedly \"hundreds\" of examples. The origins of the statue are obscure. The boy is reported to be a young Italian newspaper seller who drowned, or an American army drummer-boy who carried water in his leaking boot to help fallen comrades, or a young fire-fighter either using his boot in a bucket chain or emptying his boot after an incident, or possibly none of these. The statue has also been called The Boy with the Leaky Boot, Boy Immigrant and Unfortunate Boot.\n\nThe exact origin of the \"Boy with the Boot\" statue/fountains has been uncertain. It appears the first statues appeared in the U.S. c.1895 and were thought to have been purchased in Europe by wealthy travelers on the \"Grand European Tour\". Many stories relate the statues came from Germany, but that has not been confirmed.\n\nHowever, a connection between the statue and Germany may have more validity. Patrick Patterson of Clovis, California purchased what was purported to be the \"original\" bronze molds for the Boy with the Boot statue in 1998 from an antique dealer (Lamoine Abbott) of San Angelo, Texas. These molds of the Boy with the Boot statue were sold to the Texas dealer by \"Midwest Exchange, Inc.\" of Shawnee, Wisconsin in 1981. Midwest Exchange Inc. related the molds came from a Mr. Henry Braun, of Cincinnati, Ohio. Mr. Braun was believed to have emigrated from Germany in the 1920s and may have brought these molds with him. It was stated Henry Braun was an \"uncle\" of Eva Braun.\n\nThe bronze molds are probably the \"original\" molds because the \"original\" statues were cast in \"white metal\" (zinc) by a process of \"slurry casting\"...a process quite different from lost wax casting methods.\n\nAmong the earliest statues is that in Sandusky, Ohio, where it stood in front of the Porter House hotel on the shore of Lake Erie. The original zinc statue was brought from Germany in 1876 by a prominent local couple, Mr and Mrs Voltaire Scott. After cyclone damage and several incidences of vandalism, the statue was moved to the lobby of the local City Hall, and a replacement bronze was installed in a fountain in Washington Park.\n\nIn Helena, Montana, a statue stood in front of the \"Natatorium\", built in 1889 and housing the then-largest indoor plunge pool in the world, as part of the Broadwater Hotel complex. The statue is now in the former First National Bank Building on Last Chance Gulch in the town.\n\nOne of the statues was erected in Courthouse Park in Fresno, California in 1895. It was a drinking fountain, funded by public subscription organised by Sergeant Nichols of the Salvation Army. Tin cups hung from the statue, and the pipes were cooled by blocks of ice. The statue was purchased from the J. L. Mott Iron Works of New York. The statue was moved, vandalised and repaired on various occasions, recast in bronze in 1947, and again recast in 1995. It is currently in the Fresno County Plaza on Tulare Street.\n\nThe statue erected in 1895 in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, had a similarly chequered existence, being damaged by a horse-drawn vehicle in 1910 and thereafter cared for by the local fire department, outside whose station he stood with various incidents of damage and restoration including being decapitated in 1998 (the head was handed in to the police three days later). A concrete casting of the statue was made and erected in 2009. The original statue, restored, was in 2010 still in the possession of the fire department and it was reported that \"An idea which seems to be gathering support is to install him in a glass case inside Fire Station #1.\"\nA statue of the boy highlights a fountain on Main Street and School Street in Wallingford, Vermont, United States, and has been a centerpiece in the town since 1898.\n\nThere have been five statues in five different locations in New Orleans since 1898 when the first was erected at the Milliken Children's Hospital of Charity. The boot, all that remained after this statue was vandalised in 1961, is reported to grace the present day hospital administrator's desk. The latest statue stands in a pool at the Children's Hospital.\n\nThe village of Ellenville claims to have three of these statues: a 1997 model in the village's Liberty Square, a statue purchased in 1925 now in the Public Library, and one presumed to date from before 1908 and currently awaiting restoration. This last statue was made by J. L. Mott Iron Works and was erected on the lawn of the house then occupied by Henry Brodhead, who was paymaster for the Mott Iron Works until the company moved from New York to Trenton, New Jersey in 1908. It was used by sculptor Matt Pozorski when creating the 1997 version. The statue is described as \"an important icon of Ellenville\".\n\nA statue was erected at High Point Mansion, Hershey, Pennsylvania, then the home of Milton S. Hershey and his wife Catherine, to replace a more energetic fountain which displeased Mrs Hershey by spraying her favourite sitting place when there was a gust of wind. It is now in the Hershey Gardens. As Mrs Hershey died in 1915 this statue must be from that year or earlier.\n\nIn Penrose, Colorado, a bronze statue was erected in 1915, presented to the town by Spencer and Julie Penrose. After the common tale of kidnappings and damage, it was presented to Penrose School in 2005 and is kept there in a display case. It is the property of the Senior Citizens of Penrose.\n\nA well maintained statue with eight working drinking fountains can be seen in Houlton, Maine, in Pierce Park. It was purchased in 1916 after Mrs Clara P. Frisbie left the city $1000 to beautify the park. The statue is featured in the flash introduction of the city website home page.\n\nA statue stood in City Hall Park in El Paso, Texas for 50 years before being moved to San Jacinto Plaza, in the 1950s. There it was protected by a moat containing alligators. In 1995 it was in El Paso City Hall.\n\nA statue was acquired by Baker County, Oregon about 1908 when the county courthouse was built. The \"boy\" was the center of the fountain in front of the courthouse where he stood with his leaking boot as four lion heads spewed water toward him from the four corners of the fountain. After several repairs due to vandalism he was brought inside the courthouse and finally encased 9 June 1975.\n\nFurther statues have been reported to exist in the United States at Salida, Colorado (at the Heart of the Rockies Regional Medical Center), and Council Bluffs, Iowa\n\nA statue in Assiniboine Park, Winnipeg, Manitoba, was originally donated to the city by the Young Peoples' Christian Endeavour Society and the Trades and Labour Council in honour of Queen Victoria's golden jubilee in 1897. It formed part of a fountain outside the old city hall, and was moved to the park in 1953 with funding from Order of Rotary International Fellowship.\n\nAnother is in Toronto.\n\nAnother statue was given to the town of Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, in 1918 by John Carlbom or Calborn. It is reported that he was a Swedish immigrant to Cleethorpes who had built up a successful shipping business and was the Swedish Vice-Consul, and that the statue was a copy of one in the Hasselbacken Restaurant in Stockholm, Sweden. The Cleethorpes statue now stands in a pond in the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Gardens, on Kingsway. It was stolen and replaced in 2002 and 2008, and vandalised in October 2011. In July 2012, two youths were recorded on CCTV as they frolicked naked in the pond and destroyed the fountain. A replacement statue was made by a local garden ornaments manufacturer and installed with improved security in September 2012. A nearby pub was named \"The Leaking Boot\", but was destroyed by fire in June 2009.\n\nIn 1925 a statue was erected in Cuba in the Parque Vidal of Santa Clara, bought from J. L. Mott of New York by Colonel Francisco López Leiva. where it has become a city symbol. It is known as the Boy with the Unfortunate Boot. At some point it was damaged, and it was replaced in 1970 by a bronze statue. It has been described as \"one of the symbols of this city\".\n\nCopies of the statue are also located in Stockholm and Svappavaara, Sweden and Caracas, Venezuela.\n\nMary'n B. Rosson (died 14 November 2002) wrote an article in \"True West Magazine\" about the restoration of the El Paso statue. \"Letters about Boys in other cities poured in, loaded with Boy information\", and she \"felt compelled\" to write a book about the statue: \"The Mystery of the Boy With Leaking Boot\". It was published in 1997 by \"The Record-Courier\" of Baker City, Oregon.\n\n\n"}

It also became the third animated film in history to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, following \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"Up\".\n\n\"Toy Story\", the first film in the franchise, was released on November 22, 1995. It was the first feature-length film created entirely by CGI and was directed by John Lasseter. The plot involves Andy, an imaginative young boy, getting a new Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday, causing Sheriff Woody, a vintage cowboy doll, to think that he has been replaced as Andy's favorite toy. In competing for Andy's attention, Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out a window, leading the other toys to believe he tried to murder Buzz. Determined to set things right, Woody attempts to save Buzz, and both must escape from the house of the next-door neighbor Sid Phillips, who likes to torture and destroy toys. The film was critically and financially successful, grossing over $361 million worldwide. The film was later re-released in Disney Digital 3-D as part of a double feature, along with \"Toy Story 2\", for a 2-week run, which was later extended due to its financial success.\n\n\"Toy Story 2\", the second film in the franchise, was released on November 24, 1999. John Lasseter reprised his role as director. The plot involves Woody getting stolen by a greedy toy collector named Al McWhiggin. Buzz and several of Andy's toys set off to attempt to free Woody, who meanwhile has discovered his origins as a historic television star. \"Toy Story 2\" was not originally intended for release in theaters, but as a direct-to-video sequel to the original \"Toy Story\", with a 60-minute running time. However, Disney's executives were impressed by the high quality of the in-work imagery for the sequel, and were also pressured by the main characters' voice actors Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, so they decided to convert \"Toy Story 2\" into a theatrical film. It turned out to be an even greater success than the original \"Toy Story\", grossing over $497 million worldwide. The film was re-released in Disney Digital 3-D as part of a double feature, along with \"Toy Story\", on October 2, 2009.\n\n\"Toy Story 3\", the third film in the franchise, was released on June 18, 2010, nearly 11 years after \"Toy Story 2\" was. It was the first \"Toy Story\" film not to be directed by John Lasseter (although he remained involved in the film as executive producer), but by Lee Unkrich, who edited the first two films and co-directed the second. The plot focuses on the toys being accidentally dropped off at a daycare center while their owner, Andy, is getting ready to go to college. The film contains over 150 new characters, according to Pixar. It remains Pixar's highest-grossing film of all time both domestically and worldwide, surpassing \"Finding Nemo\". \"Toy Story 3\" grossed more than the first and second films combined, making it the first animated film to have crossed the $1 billion mark. In August 2010, it surpassed \"Shrek 2\", becoming the highest-grossing animated film of all time until it was surpassed by \"Frozen\", another Disney production, in March 2014. \"Toy Story 3\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 2, 2010.\n\nOn November 6, 2014, \"Toy Story 4\" was officially announced by Disney during an investors' call, with a provisional release date of June 16, 2017. The film was to be directed by John Lasseter and produced by Galyn Susman, with a screenplay by Rashida Jones and Will McCormack from a story by Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter and Lee Unkrich. Lasseter told \"Variety\": \"\"Toy Story 3\" ended Woody and Buzz's story with Andy so perfectly that for a long time, we never even talked about doing another \"Toy Story\" movie. But when Andrew, Pete, Lee and I came up with this new idea, I just could not stop thinking about it. It was so exciting to me, I knew we had to make this movie—and I wanted to direct it myself.\" In March 2015, Pixar president Jim Morris stated that the film would be a stand-alone sequel rather than a continuation of the third film. The same month, \"Variety\" revealed that Josh Cooley, the head of story on Pixar's \"Inside Out\", would co-direct \"Toy Story 4\". Around the same time, Lasseter revealed that the fourth film had been such a closely held secret at Pixar that even Morris and Edwin Catmull (president of both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, to whom Morris reports) did not know it was being discussed until Stanton had already finished a polished treatment.\n\nIn August 2015, at the D23 Expo, Lasseter stated that the film would focus on the romance between Woody and Bo Peep, building on Bo Peep's absence from \"Toy Story 3\", with Woody and Buzz trying to find her and bring her home. It was also announced that Randy Newman would return to compose the soundtrack. The same month, Kristen Schaal confirmed that her character Trixie would return. It was also announced that Don Rickles would reprise his role of Mr. Potato Head, though on April 6, 2017, it was announced that he had died before he was able to record any lines for the film. In November 2015, it was announced that Patricia Arquette had been added to the cast. \n\nIn October 2015, Pixar announced that the release date had been pushed back to June 15, 2018.\n\nIn October 2016, \"Variety\" confirmed that the release date had been further delayed until June 21, 2019.\n\nIn July 2017, at the D23 Expo, Lasseter announced he had stepped down as director due to other commitments, but would stay on board as executive producer while Cooley would be upgraded to director and that Jonas Rivera would replace Galyn Susman as producer. It was also confirmed that Bonnie Hunt would return as Dolly, Jodi Benson as Barbie, and Estelle Harris as Mrs. Potato Head.\n\nOn January 18, 2018, it was announced that the film would be written by Stephany Folsom, replacing the original writers, Rashida Jones and Will McCormack, who withdrew from the project in November 2017. On June 2, 2018, it was announced that the script had been rewritten after about three-quarters of it was written. As a result, the original script written by Jones and McCormack was scrapped. It was also confirmed that Annie Potts will reprise her role as Bo Peep.\n\nOn April 7, 2018, it was confirmed on the official \"Toy Story\" Facebook page that the film is still set for release on June 21, 2019 in 3D, 2D and IMAX 3D.\n\nIn 1996, Pixar created a series of shorts known as \"Toy Story Treats\", which were used as interstitials on ABC Family and Disney's One Saturday Morning. They did not necessarily follow the continuity from \"Toy Story\", taking place before, during and after the events of the first film. They were aired roughly around the time of \"Toy Story\"'s release to home video. These shorts also appeared as bonus features on both \"The Ultimate Toy Box\", and the \"10th Anniversary Edition\" DVD.\n\nPixar has also developed two 22-minute \"Toy Story\" television specials. The first, a Halloween-themed special, titled \"Toy Story of Terror!\", aired on October 16, 2013, on ABC, while the second, a Christmas-themed special titled \"Toy Story That Time Forgot\", aired on December 2, 2014.\n\nA Halloween-themed 22-minute television special, titled \"Toy Story of Terror!\", aired on ABC on October 16, 2013. It was directed by Angus MacLane, produced by Galyn Susman, with Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Timothy Dalton, and Kristen Schaal reprising their roles of Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Mr. Potato Head, Rex, Mr. Pricklepants, and Trixie with Carl Weathers as Combat Carl and Stephen Tobolowsky as the motel manager. Michael Giacchino composed the music for the special. The film's soundtrack was released on October 15, 2013, on Amazon.com in digital format.\n\nThe special follows the toys on their road trip when a flat tire leads Bonnie and her mother to spend the night in a roadside motel. After one of the toys goes missing, the others begin to search for it, but they too are picked off one by one. The toys discover that they are being targeted by the hotel manager's pet iguana, Mr. Jones, who has been trained to steal the toys of his guests so that they can be sold via the Internet. The manager nearly succeeds in selling Woody and Jessie, but Jessie manages to escape—overcoming her old fear of being packed away in the process—and draw Bonnie's attention to the cabinet where the toys are being kept. As a result, Bonnie recovers her toys, and her mom calls in the police, who then presumably arrests the manager for theft.\n\nA Christmas-themed 22-minute television special, titled \"Toy Story That Time Forgot\", aired on ABC on December 2, 2014. It was written and directed by Steve Purcell, and produced by Galyn Susman. Michael Giacchino, who composed the music for the first special, returned. Most of the regular cast reprised their roles, including Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, Kristen Schaal as Trixie, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Timothy Dalton as Mr. Pricklepants, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, and Joan Cusack as Jessie, with Kevin McKidd joining as a new character, Reptillus Maximus. Taking place after a Christmas season, the toys find themselves lost in the world when a set of the coolest action figures turns out to be dangerously delusional. It is up to Trixie to help the toys to return to Bonnie's room.\n\nIn 2011, Pixar started releasing short animated films to supplement the \"Toy Story\" films, called \"Toy Story Toons\". The shorts pick up where \"Toy Story 3\" has left off, with Woody, Buzz, and Andy's other toys finding a new home at Bonnie's. So far, three shorts have been released; \"Hawaiian Vacation\", \"Small Fry\", and \"Partysaurus Rex\". Another short, titled \"Mythic Rock\", was in development in 2013 but was never released.\n\nToy Story Toons: Hawaiian Vacation is a 2011 Pixar animated short directed by Gary Rydstrom. The short features characters from the \"Toy Story\" series and takes place after the events of \"Toy Story 3\". It was released in theatres before Pixar's feature film \"Cars 2\". In the short film, Ken and Barbie want to go to Hawaii with Bonnie's family, who had prior plans to vacation in Hawaii, but get left behind by mistakenly climbing into Bonnie's school bookbag instead of her luggage. Once in Bonnie's bedroom, Woody, Buzz and the other toys from the previous film attempt to console them by creating their own \"Hawaiian vacation\" for Barbie and Ken in Bonnie's bedroom.\n\nToy Story Toons: Small Fry, another \"Toy Story\" short, premiered before \"The Muppets\". This marks the second time a Pixar short has screened with a non-Pixar film, after \"Tokyo Mater\" screened with \"Bolt\". Directed by Angus MacLane, the short involves Buzz getting trapped at a fast food restaurant at a support group for discarded toys, with a kids' meal toy version of Buzz taking his place.\n\nToy Story Toons: Partysaurus Rex, the third of the series of animated shorts, was released with the theatrical 3D re-release of \"Finding Nemo\". Directed by Mark Walsh with music composed by electronic artist BT, the short involves Rex getting left in the bathroom and making friends with bath toys.\n\n\"Toy Story\"s first five days of domestic release (on Thanksgiving weekend), earned the film $39,071,176.

In this film, Buzz Lightyear is a space ranger who fights against the evil Emperor Zurg, showing the inspiration for the Buzz Lightyear toyline that exists in the \"Toy Story\" series. Although the film was criticized for not using the same animation as in \"Toy Story\" and \"Toy Story 2\", it sold three million VHS and DVDs in its first week of release.\n\n\n\nPixar created original animations for the games, including fully animated sequences for PC titles.\n\nWoody and Buzz Lightyear were originally going to appear in the \"Final Mix\" version of the Disney/Square Enix video game \"Kingdom Hearts II.\" They were omitted from the final product, but their models appear in the game's coding, without textures. The director of the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series, Tetsuya Nomura, stated that he would like to include Pixar property in future \"Kingdom Hearts\" games, given Disney's purchase of Pixar. A stage based on \"Toy Story\" will make its debut appearance in the series in \"Kingdom Hearts III\", marking the first time that Pixar-based content appears in the series. The game will have an original story set in the \"Toy Story\" universe.\n\n\"Toy Story\" had a large promotion before its release, leading to numerous tie-ins with the film including images on food packaging. A variety of merchandise was released during the film's theatrical run and its initial VHS release including toys, clothing, and shoes, among other things. When action figures for Buzz Lightyear and Sheriff Woody were created, they were initially ignored by retailers. However, after over 250,000 figures were sold for each character before the film's release, demand continued to expand, eventually reaching over 25 million units sold by 2007. Also, \"\" and \"Disney's Activity Center: Toy Story\" were released for Windows and Mac. \"Disney's Animated Storybook: Toy Story\" was the best selling software title of 1996, selling over 500,000 copies.\n\n\nTotally Toy Story was an instant theme park and a promotional event for the \"Toy Story\" movie premiere held at El Capitan Theatre and Masonic Convention Hall.\n\nFor the November 18, 1995 \"Toy Story\" premiere at El Capitan Theatre, Disney rented the Masonic Convention Hall, the next door building, for Totally Toy Story, an instant theme park and a promotional event for the movie.

The Toy Story Funhouse part was moved to Disneyland's Tomorrowland and opened there on January 27, 1996 and closed on May 27, 1996.\n\nTotally Toy Story, while in Hollywood, consisted of \"Toy Story Art of Animation\" exhibit in El Capitan's basement and the Toy Story Funhouse at the convention hall. The fun house consisted of 30,000-square-foot of various attractions. These attractions continue the story of the movie with the toys life-size.\n\nToy Story Funhouse attractions\n\n\"Toy Story\"'s innovative computer animation had a large impact on the film industry. After the film's debut, various industries were interested in the technology used for the film. Graphics chip makers desired to compute imagery similar to the film's animation for personal computers; game developers wanted to learn how to replicate the animation for video games; and robotics researchers were interested in building artificial intelligence into their machines that compared to the lifelike characters in the film. Various authors have also compared the film to an interpretation of \"Don Quixote\" as well as humanism.\n\nIn 2013, Pixar designed a \"Gromit Lightyear\" sculpture based on the Aardman Animations character Gromit from Wallace and Gromit for Gromit Unleashed which sold for £65,000.\n\nBuzz Lightyear's classic line \"To infinity and beyond!\" has seen usage not only on T-shirts, but among philosophers and mathematical theorists as well. Lucia Hall of \"The Humanist\" linked the film's plot to an interpretation of humanism. She compared the phrase to \"All this and heaven, too!\", indicating one who is happy with a life on Earth as well as having an afterlife. In 2008, during STS-124, astronauts took an action figure of Buzz Lightyear into space on the \"Discovery\" Space Shuttle as part of an educational experience for students that also stressed the catchphrase. The action figure was used for experiments in zero-g. Also, in 2008, the phrase made international news when it was reported that a father and son had continually repeated the phrase to help them keep track of each other while treading water for 15 hours in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n"}
