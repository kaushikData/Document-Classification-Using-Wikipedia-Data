The five artists whose work was shown were Aleksandra Ekster, Lyubov Popova, Alexander Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova and Alexander Vesnin. They presented highly abstracted, geometric work that rejected expressionist forms of painting common before the World War I and pretended to be the \"end\" or \"death\" of art.\n\nRodchenko presented three canvases of a single colour (red, yellow and blue). He saw that his formal research into Constructivism had reached completion at this point, and claimed that he had demonstrated the \"end of painting\". The exhibition has been considered an anti-painting manifesto.\n\nLyubov Popova showed canvasses almost bare, puzzling viewers and provoking hail from the critics. Her \"flight from painting\" influenced Wassily Kandinsky, Mark Rothko and Ad Reinhardt. Popova herself did not regard her works as \"the end\"; on the contrary, she wrote, \"all pieces presented here should be regarded as merely preparations for concrete construction\".\n\nAlexander Vesnin presented five abstract cubist canvases that appear pure abstractions but were, in fact, ultimate decomposition of human figures. Vesnin's catalogue cover, in particular, is typical of his book and advertising art of the period: numbers in two \"lines\" (5x5 and 25) are offset against the baseline, but this irregularity is \"disguised\" by angled lines dissecting the space.\n\nCatalogues of the exhibition were hand-drawn by the artists and contained original artwork that has never been displayed publicly. At least ten unique albums survive in Russia to date. The 1921 show was reconstructed in 2009 in London's Tate Gallery. Modern critics remain divided over the question of whether \"death of painting\" was a genuine statement of modern art or, indeed, it was a dead end with no future.\n\n"}

In this theory, life and the affairs of living are conceived of as innately artistic, and related to as such politically. Politics are in turn viewed as artistic, and structured like an art form which reciprocates the artistic conception of life being seen as art.\n\nThis has also been noted as being connected to the Italian Futurist movement and postulated as its main motivation for getting involved in the Fascist regime of Italy.\n\nAlternately, \"politicization of aesthetics\" (or \"politicization of art\") has been used as a term for an ideologically opposing synthesis, sometimes associated with the Soviet Union, wherein art is ultimately subordinate to political life and thus a result of it, separate from it, but which is attempted to be incorporated for political use as theory relating to the consequential political nature of art. The author Emilio Gentile has stressed that these two ideas are not mutually exclusive, and both regimes had a large degree of the other. In Benjamin's original formulation, however, the politicization of aesthetics was treated conceptually as the polar opposite of the aestheticization of politics, the former treated as a kind of revolutionary praxis, redeeming force, or \"antidote\" to the corrupting fascistic influence of the latter.\n\n"}

{"id": "2083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083", "title": "Auguste and Louis Lumière", "text": "Auguste and Louis Lumière\n\nThe Lumière brothers (, ; ), Auguste Marie Louis Nicolas (; 19 October 1862 – 10 April 1954) and Louis Jean (; 5 October 1864 – 7 June 1948), were among the first filmmakers in history. They patented an improved cinematograph, which in contrast to Thomas Edison's \"peepshow\" kinetoscope allowed simultaneous viewing by multiple parties.\n\nThe Lumière brothers were born in Besançon, France, to Charles-Antoine Lumière (1840–1911) and Jeanne Joséphine Costille Lumière, who were married in 1861 and moved to Besançon, setting up a small photographic portrait studio where Auguste and Louis were born. They moved to Lyon in 1870, where son Edouard and three daughters were born. Auguste and Louis both attended La Martiniere, the largest technical school in Lyon. Their father Charles-Antoine set up a small factory producing photographic plates, but even with Louis and a young sister working from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. it teetered on the verge of bankruptcy, and by 1882 it looked as if they would fail, but when Auguste returned from military service the boys designed the machines necessary to automate their father's plate production and devised a very successful new photo plate, 'etiquettes bleue', and by 1884 the factory employed a dozen workers.\nWhen their father retired in 1892 the brothers began to create moving pictures. They patented several significant processes leading up to their film camera, most notably film perforations (originally implemented by Emile Reynaud) as a means of advancing the film through the camera and projector. The original cinématographe had been patented by Léon Guillaume Bouly on 12 February 1892. The brothers patented their own version on 13 February 1895. The first footage ever to be recorded using it was recorded on 19 March 1895. This first film shows workers leaving the Lumière factory.\n\nThe Lumière brothers saw film as a novelty and had withdrawn from the film business in 1905. They went on to develop the first practical photographic colour process, the Lumière Autochrome.\n\nLouis died on 6 June 1948 and Auguste on 10 April 1954. They are buried in a family tomb in the New Guillotière Cemetery in Lyon.\n\nThe Lumières held their first private screening of projected motion pictures in 1895. This first screening on 22 March 1895 took place in Paris, at the \"Society for the Development of the National Industry\", in front of an audience of 200 people – among which Léon Gaumont, then director of the company the Comptoir géneral de la photographie. The main focus of this conference by Louis Lumière were the recent developments in the photograph industry, mainly the research on polychromy (colour photography). It was much to Lumière's surprise that the moving black-and-white images retained more attention than the coloured stills photographs. The American Woodville Latham had screened works of film 2 months later on 20 May 1895. The first public screening of films at which admission was charged was a program by the Skladanowsky brothers that was held on 1 November 1895, in Berlin.\n\nThe Lumières gave their first paid public screening on 28 December 1895, at Salon Indien du Grand Café in Paris. This history-making presentation featured 10 short films, including their first film, \"Sortie des Usines Lumière à Lyon\" (\"Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory\").\nEach film is 17 meters long, which, when hand cranked through a projector, runs approximately 50 seconds.\n\nThe public debut at the Grand Café came a few months later and consisted of the following 10 short films (in order of presentation):\n\n\nThe Lumières went on tour with the cinématographe in 1896, visiting Brussels (the first place a film was played outside Paris on the Galleries Saint-Hubert on 1 March 1896), Bombay, London, Montreal, New York City and Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 1896, only a few months after the initial screenings in Europe, films by the Lumiere Brothers were shown in Egypt, first in the Tousson stock exchange in Alexandria on 5 November 1896 and then in the Hamam Schneider (Schneider Bath) in Cairo.\n\nThe moving images had an immediate and significant influence on popular culture with \"L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat\" (literally, \"the arrival of a train at La Ciotat\", but more commonly known as \"Arrival of a Train at a Station\") and \"Carmaux, défournage du coke\" (Drawing out the coke). Their actuality films, or \"actualités\", are often cited as the first, primitive documentaries. They also made the first steps towards comedy film with the slapstick of \"L'Arroseur Arrosé\".\n\nThe brothers stated that \"the cinema is an invention without any future\" and declined to sell their camera to other filmmakers such as Georges Méliès. This made many film makers upset. Consequently, their role in the history of film was exceedingly brief. In parallel with their cinema work they experimented with colour photography. They worked on a number of colour photographic processes in the 1890s including the Lippmann process (interference heliochromy) and their own 'bichromated glue' process, a subtractive colour process, examples of which were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900. This last process was commercialised by the Lumieres but commercial success had to wait for their next colour process. In 1903 they patented a colour photographic process, the \"Autochrome Lumière\", which was launched on the market in 1907. Throughout much of the 20th century, the Lumière company was a major producer of photographic products in Europe, but the brand name, Lumière, disappeared from the marketplace following merger with Ilford. They also invented the colour plate, which really got photography on the road.\n\nThe Lumière Brothers were not the only ones to claim the title of the first cinematographers. The scientific chronophotography devices developed by Eadweard Muybridge, Étienne-Jules Marey and Ottomar Anschütz in the 1880s were able to produce moving photographs, and William Friese-Greene's \"machine camera\", patented in 1889, did so on a strip of film. Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope (developed by William Kennedy Dickson), premiered publicly in 1894.\n\nSince 1892, the projected drawings of Émile Reynaud's Théâtre Optique were attracting Paris crowds to the Musée Grévin. Louis Le Prince and Claude Mechant had been shooting moving picture sequences on paper film as soon as 1888, but had never performed a public demonstration. Polish inventor, Kazimierz Prószyński had built his camera and projecting device, called Pleograph, in 1894. Max and Emil Skladanowsky, inventors of the Bioscop, had offered projected moving images to a paying public one month earlier (1 November 1895, in Berlin). Nevertheless, film historians consider the Grand Café screening to be the true birth of the cinema as a commercial medium, because the Skladanowsky brothers' screening used an extremely impractical dual system motion picture projector that was immediately supplanted by the Lumiere cinematographe.\n\nAlthough the Lumière brothers were not the first inventors to develop techniques to create motion pictures, they are often credited as among the first inventors of the technology for cinema as a mass medium, and are among the first who understood how to use it.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3283057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3283057", "title": "Booze cruise", "text": "Booze cruise\n\nBooze cruise is a British colloquial term for a brief trip from Britain to France or Belgium with the intent of taking advantage of lower prices, and buying personal supplies of (especially) alcohol or tobacco in bulk quantities. This is a legally acceptable process and should not be confused with smuggling.\n\nThe term is also used in other countries to refer to a pleasure outing on a ship or boat involving a significant amount of drinking, or an outing to purchase large amounts of alcohol in bulk for a party or outing. It probably originated during Prohibition, when Americans would take \"cruises to nowhere\" to enjoy alcohol, which could legally be served on board once outside American territorial waters.\n\nGenerally, alcohol and tobacco taxes are lower in France than in Britain. Economically, it makes sense for people to buy their supplies of wine, beer, spirits, and tobacco in bulk in France instead of Britain. There is keen competition between ferry operators and the Channel Tunnel Eurotunnel Shuttle. The day fares to Calais are normally around £60 per vehicle, but are sometimes discounted to as little as £10 at off-peak times. Since beer often costs little more than half the English shop price, at worst, the savings defray the cost of a day out.\n\nServing this market has become big business around the major ferry ports of Calais, Boulogne, and Dunkirk in France, and Ostend in Belgium. Even longer routes from Cherbourg, Normandy and Brittany generate business, boosted by ferries from Ireland where alcohol duties are even higher. The exit route from the Calais ferry port passes several large warehouse retailers (English-owned) that serve the market, and some large British supermarket chains have alcohol-only branches selling bottles identical to those in Britain, but at deep discounts. The French have opened an enormous shopping precinct adjacent to the Channel Tunnel (Cité Europe) that attracts large numbers of British shoppers.\n\nFollowing large increases in tobacco duty in France, it is now very common for smokers to make a detour to the small town of Adinkerke just over the border in Belgium, where tobacco duty is lower. Many people intending to purchase mainly tobacco products opt for the revitalised service from Dover to Dunkirk, as Dunkirk is much closer to the Belgian border than Calais, and the ferries on this route are slightly more 'smoker-friendly'. Some buying both tobacco and alcohol make a triangular journey (Dover - Dunkirk - Calais - Dover or vice versa).\n\nIt is important to differentiate between booze cruisers (who purchase and transport goods legally) and professional smugglers, who often have criminal motives. Genuine booze cruisers are often people 'on a budget', who simply opt to purchase their own personal supplies from 'Shop A' (in France or Belgium) at lower prices than offered at 'Shop B' (in Britain). Booze cruisers normally travel as a family or group of friends, and often take the opportunity to generally have a 'day out' in France and indulge in recreational 'channel shopping' for French produce and unfamiliar foods, clothing and other goods while they are there. In addition to alcohol and tobacco, many other items, including mundane household items such as washing powder and cooking oil are much cheaper in France than the UK.\n\nThe cost of getting to France fluctuates due to season and fuel surcharges, but fares for foot passengers remain low. Calais in particular is very well-served by public transport, with the ferry companies also providing a shuttle bus from the ferry terminal to the town centre and (by request) the bus interchange at the SNCF railway station.\n\nFrench tobacco duties have also risen, reducing further the economic advantage of a \"booze cruise\". Unless one is close to the Channel ports, it's unlikely to be financially beneficial. The motivation is changing, therefore, from purely economic to leisure and variety of choice.\n\nOriginally alcohol purchases on board the ferry had the additional attraction of being duty-free, adding a secondary meaning to booze cruise.\n\nThe current situation benefits individuals living near to the English south coast who retain an economic advantage by shopping in France. It benefits the entrepreneurs who have businesses around the French ports dependent upon bulk purchases and also other local businesses that benefit from passing trade. The Calais area suffers high unemployment (around 20%) and benefits from the service jobs created by the influx of English day-trippers. The ferry and tunnel operators also benefit from the extra traffic, in a situation that might otherwise be over-supplied.\n\nOn the downside, UK taxes (especially on tobacco) seem to have risen beyond the point of diminishing returns, so the British Exchequer loses substantial revenue that might otherwise have been collected to the economies of France and Belgium. Shops (particularly in the English South-East) also report that their trade suffers because taxes make their prices uncompetitive with both legal and illegal imports.\n\nA recent French law has effectively outlawed tobacco tourism which uses France either as a destination or as a route. Under pressure from the tobacco sellers interest group, les bureaux de tabac, and despite the resistance of the French government, the French Parliament has enacted a law that makes it illegal to transport more than 200 cigarettes whilst in French territory: fines and confiscation are sanctions if a person is found to be in possession of more than 200 cigarettes whilst traveling through/in France. The law is designed to prevent French citizens buying tobacco in Belgium and Luxembourg.\n\nFollowing recent tax increases in France it has become more attractive for French citizens to buy tobacco in Belgium and Luxembourg. The law also applies to citizens of other European countries traveling through France with more than 200 cigarettes in their possession. There is a suggestion that the law is incompatible with European Commission directives which demand freedom of movement and goods, for personal use, across the borders of European Union countries excluding specifically named \"new member states\".\n\nEU Directive 92/12 Article 8 states: \"\"As regards products acquired by private individuals for their own use and transported by them... excise duty shall be charged in the member state in which they are acquired\".\"\n\nIn answer to a legal challenge; a European Court of Justice ruling on 23 November 2006 surprisingly overturned their own Advocate-General's advice and reconfirmed that: \"\"only products acquired and transported personally by private individuals are exempt from excise duty in the member state of importation\".\"\n\nThis ruling effectively thwarted the hoped-for option of ordering goods (particularly tobacco), via Internet, from low duty states in the European Union and having them posted to a United Kingdom address, causing discussion in the British media about how a supposed 'Free Trade Area' seems to work for the benefit of some but not others.\n\nThe current position is: people may personally \"bring\" into Britain \"with them\" unlimited amounts of alcohol and/or tobacco from another EU member state, provided that they have been legally purchased (with the relevant local rate of duty paid) in the member state of origin, and are for either personal consumption, or as a genuine gift to another. Importing goods for resale at a profit, or even 'not for profit' proxy purchases on behalf of non-travelling third parties is not permitted.\n\nAlthough fully aware of this, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), faced with widespread abuse by smugglers, impose 'guidelines' - limits based on what they are prepared to believe are reasonable amounts for personal consumption (nominally six months' supply). Most travellers are unaffected, but there are instances of infrequent trippers forward-buying large supplies of (for example) their favourite brand of cigarette, and falling foul of the 'limits' intended to deal with professional smugglers.\n\nHMRC have the legal right to stop and search any vehicle. As their main duty is to detect 'smuggled' goods (and other far more sinister imports), they can (and usually do) use their own common sense regarding unconcealed (i.e. openly carried) goods above their 'limits', if they are happy that the goods are genuinely for personal consumption. Generally, suspicion will only be aroused if the goods start to look less like a 'personal' hoard, and more like a commercial operation. For example: importing more different brands of tobacco products than there are adult travellers in the vehicle arouses particular suspicion, as most smokers tend to remain loyal to one particular brand. However, there have been reported cases of more extreme treatment (especially where people have unnecessarily concealed extra goods in vehicle cavities, spare wheel wells etc.), with family cars and contents being confiscated on the spot and the travelers left stranded at Dover in the dead of night. This has led to legal challenges to the powers of HMRC, citing the heavy-handedness and inconsistency of some actions, and their dubious legality under European law.\n\nA variation on the standard booze cruise was the ill-fated offshore off-licence which operated briefly off Hartlepool in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The bungalow camp was run by Susanna Valenti and her wife Marie, who also ran a wig store in town. Marie purchased the 150-acre property in the mid-1950s, and she and Susanna originally dubbed it \"Chevalier D'Eon Resort.\" They charged $25 for a weekend, which included food, lodging, and makeup lesson. Hidden away in the rural Catskills, Casa Susanna provided much-needed privacy to its guests in a time when being publicly transgender was a criminal offense. However, guests occasionally visited the town of Hunter to shop, where they were met by a range of reactions. Some were negative, but many locals saw them as reliable customers. Casa Susanna was a haven for its guests to go to and celebrate their \"inner girl\" without persecution. There, they could be happy and comfortable, participating in activities like gardening and Scrabble in elegant 1950s-style heels and dresses. Most guests at Casa Susanna were married and considered themselves heterosexual men who enjoyed cross-dressing, but many others later identified as transgender and lived out their lives as women, including Virginia Prince and Susanna herself.\n\nPhotography for transvestites in the 1950s was both affirming and extremely dangerous. Sending negatives to a professional developer who might call the police was out of the question, so Casa Susanna appointed an official photographer from one of its own: Andrea Susan. Andrea took many photographs of her fellow guests and developed them at home. Although Polaroids were popular for their instantaneous development, Andrea's photography was of higher quality, and she could be trusted. She put the negatives in the possession of her mentor Dick, who had gifted her her photo development equipment. When Dick threw them away, they made their way to a Manhattan flea market in the mid-2000s. There, they were found by Robert Swope, “a gentle punk rocker turned furniture dealer,” who bought every photograph he could find and published them into a book with his partner Michel Hurst. The release of this book fifty years later led many former attendees of Casa Susanna to come forward and share their experiences, allowing the resort to be documented. Without this chance encounter, Casa Susanna may have been lost to history.\n\nCasa Susanna also inspired the Tony-nominated play Casa Valentina by Harvey Fierstein.\n"}
{"id": "728004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=728004", "title": "Chaos (cosmogony)", "text": "Chaos (cosmogony)\n\nChaos (Ancient Greek: , \"khaos\") refers to the void state preceding the creation of the universe or cosmos in the Greek creation myths, or to the initial \"gap\" created by the original separation of heaven and earth. In Hesiod's \"Theogony\" (c. 700 BC), Chaos was the first of the primordial deities, followed by Gaia (Earth), Tartarus (the nether abyss), and Eros (Love). From Chaos came Erebus (Darkness) and Nyx (Night).\n\nGreek means \"emptiness, vast void, chasm, abyss\", from the verb , \"gape, be wide open, etc.\", from Proto-Indo-European \"\", cognate to Old English \"geanian\", \"to gape\", whence English \"yawn\". \n\nIt may also mean space, the expanse of air, and the nether abyss, infinite darkness. Pherecydes of Syros (fl. 6th century BC) interprets \"chaos\" as water, like something formless which can be differentiated.\n\nHesiod and the Pre-Socratics use the Greek term in the context of cosmogony. Hesiod's \"chaos\" has been interpreted as either\n\"the gaping void above the Earth created when Earth and Sky are separated from their primordial unity\" or \"the gaping space below the Earth on which Earth rests\". \n\nIn Hesiod, Chaos was the first thing to exist: \"at first Chaos came to be\" (or was) \"but next\" (possibly out of Chaos) came Gaia, Tartarus, and Eros (elsewhere the son of Aphrodite). Unambiguously born \"from Chaos\" were Erebus (Darkness) and Nyx (Night). For Hesiod, Chaos, like Tartarus, though personified enough to have borne children, was also a place, far away, underground and \"gloomy\", beyond which lived the Titans. And, like the earth, the ocean, and the upper air, it was also capable of being affected by Zeus' thunderbolts.\n\nPassages in Hesiod's \"Theogony\" suggest that Chaos was located below Earth but above Tartarus. Primal Chaos was sometimes said to be the true foundation of reality, particularly by philosophers such as Heraclitus.\n\nThe notion of the temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality. This idea of the divine as an origin influenced the first Greek philosophers. The main object of the first efforts to explain the world remained the description of its growth, from a beginning. They believed that the world arose out from a primal unity, and that this substance was the permanent base of all its being. Anaximander claims that the origin is \"apeiron\" (the unlimited), a divine and perpetual substance less definite than the common elements. Everything is generated from \"apeiron\", and must return there according to necessity. A conception of the nature of the world was that the earth below its surface stretches down indefinitely and has its roots on or above Tartarus, the lower part of the underworld. In a phrase of Xenophanes, \"The upper limit of the earth borders on air, near our feet. The lower limit reaches down to the \"apeiron\" (i.e. the unlimited).\" The sources and limits of the earth, the sea, the sky, Tartarus, and all things are located in a great windy-gap, which seems to be infinite, and is a later specification of \"chaos\".\n\nIn Aristophanes's comedy \"Birds\", first there was Chaos, Night, Erebus, and Tartarus, from Night came Eros, and from Eros and Chaos came the race of birds.\nFor Ovid, (1st century BC), in his \"Metamorphoses\", Chaos was an unformed mass, where all the elements were jumbled up together in a \"shapeless heap\".\n\nAccording to Hyginus: \"From Mist (\"Caligine\") came Chaos. From Chaos and Mist, came Night (\"Nox\"), Day (\"Dies\"), Darkness (\"Erebus\"), and Ether (\"Aether\").\" An Orphic tradition apparently had Chaos as the son of Chronus and Ananke.\n\nFifth-century Orphic cosmogony had a \"Womb of Darkness\" in which the Wind lay a \"Cosmic Egg\" whence Eros was hatched, who set the universe in motion.\n\nThe motif of \"Chaoskampf\" (, \"struggle against chaos\") is ubiquitous in myth and legend, depicting a battle of a culture hero deity with a \"chaos monster\", often in the shape of a serpent or dragon. The same term has also been extended to parallel concepts in the Middle East and North Africa, such as the abstract conflict of ideas in the Egyptian duality of Maat and Isfet or the battle of Horus and Set.\n\nThe origins of the \"Chaoskampf\" myth most likely lie in the Proto-Indo-European religion whose descendants almost all feature some variation of the story of a storm god fighting a sea serpent representing the clash between the forces of order and chaos. Early work by German academics such as Gunkel and Bousset in comparative mythology popularized translating the mythological sea serpent as a \"dragon.\" Indo-European examples of this mythic trope include Thor vs. Jörmungandr (Norse), Tarḫunz vs. Illuyanka (Hittite), Indra vs. Vritra (Vedic), Θraētaona vs. Aži Dahāka (Avestan) and Zeus vs. Typhon (Greek) among others. Non-Indo-European examples of this trope are Marduk vs. Tiamat, Yahweh vs. Leviathan (Hebrew), Susano'o vs. Yamata no Orochi (Japanese) and Mwindo vs. Kirimu (African).\n\n\"Chaos\" has been linked with the term \"abyss\"/\"tohu wa-bohu\" of . The term may refer to a state of non-being prior to creation or to a formless state. In the Book of Genesis, the spirit of God is moving upon the face of the waters, displacing the earlier state of the universe which is likened to a \"watery chaos\" upon which there is \"choshek\" (which translated from the Hebrew is darkness/confusion). \n\nThe Septuagint makes no use of in the context of creation, instead using the term for , \"cleft, gorge, chasm\", in Micah 1:6 and Zacharia 14:4.\nThe Vulgate, however, renders the χάσμα μέγα or \"great gulf\" between heaven and hell in Luke 16:26 as \"chaos magnum\".\n\nThis model of a primordial state of matter has been opposed by the Church Fathers from the 2nd century, who posited a creation \"ex nihilo\" by an omnipotent God.\n\nIn modern biblical studies, the term \"chaos\" is commonly used in the context of the Torah and their cognate narratives in Ancient Near Eastern mythology more generally. Parallels between the Hebrew Genesis and the Babylonian Enuma Elish were established by Hermann Gunkel in 1910. Besides Genesis, other books of the Old Testament, especially a number of Psalms, some passages in Isaiah and Jeremiah and the Book of Job are relevant.\n\nThe Greco-Roman tradition of \"Prima Materia\", notably including the 5th and 6th century Orphic cosmogony, was merged with biblical notions (\"Tehom\") in Christianity and inherited by alchemy and Renaissance magic.\n\nThe cosmic egg of Orphism was taken as the raw material for the alchemical magnum opus in early Greek alchemy. The first stage of the process of producing the philosopher's stone, i.e., nigredo, was identified with chaos. Because of association with the Genesis creation narrative, where \"the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters\" (Gen. 1:2), Chaos was further identified with the classical element of Water.\n\nRamon Llull (1232–1315) wrote a \"Liber Chaos\", in which he identifies Chaos as the primal form or matter created by God.\nSwiss alchemist Paracelsus (1493–1541) uses \"chaos\" synonymously with \"classical element\" (because the primeval chaos is imagined as a formless congestion of all elements). Paracelsus thus identifies Earth as \"the chaos of the \"gnomi\"\", i.e., the element of the gnomes, through which these spirits move unobstructed as fish do through water, or birds through air.\nAn alchemical treatise by Heinrich Khunrath, printed in Frankfurt in 1708, was entitled \"Chaos\". The 1708 introduction to the treatise states that the treatise was written in 1597 in Magdeburg, in the author's 23rd year of practicing alchemy. The treatise purports to quote Paracelsus on the point that \"The light of the soul, by the will of the Triune God, made all earthly things appear from the primal Chaos.\"\nMartin Ruland the Younger, in his 1612 \"Lexicon Alchemiae\", states, \"A crude mixture of matter or another name for \"Materia Prima\" is \"Chaos\", as it is in the Beginning.\"\n\nThe term \"gas\" in chemistry was coined by Dutch chemist Jan Baptist van Helmont in the 17th century directly based on the Paracelsian notion of chaos. The \"g\" in \"gas\" is due to the Dutch pronunciation of this letter as a spirant, also employed to pronounce Greek χ.\n\nThe term \"chaos\" has been adopted in modern comparative mythology and religious studies as referring to the primordial state before creation, strictly combining two separate notions of primordial waters or a primordial darkness from which a new order emerges and a primordial state as a merging of opposites, such as heaven and earth, which must be separated by a creator deity in an act of cosmogony. In both cases, chaos referring to a notion of a primordial state contains the cosmos \"in potentia\" but needs to be formed by a demiurge before the world can begin its existence.\n\nUse of \"chaos\" in the derived sense of \"complete disorder or confusion\" first appears in Elizabethan Early Modern English, originally implying satirical exaggeration.\n\"Chaos\" in the well-defined sense of chaotic complex system is in turn derived from this usage.\n\n\"Chaos magic\" as a branch of contemporary occultism is a product of the 1970s.\n\n\n"}

Reported in the 1890s, these airships were distinguished from our technology by their giant size, but they nevertheless needed propellers. The later flying saucers were also a weird version of then-current aerospace technology; as John Spencer notes in \"The UFO Encyclopedia\": \"Witnesses aboard flying saucers have reported, for example, chunky number counters on the saucer control panels, but we did not have reports of liquid quartz readouts until we ourselves invented them.\"\n\nReports also track the science fiction prevalent at the time. Claims of UFOs stopping car engines and lights did not appear until a similar effect featured in the 1951 film \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\". Similarly, the film \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" had the effect of standardizing accounts of grey aliens with entirely black eyes, though these were the invention of the film's special effects man, Carlo Rambaldi. Note: This is actually not true. Spielberg utilized J. Allen Hynek and resorts from abductees from the time to inform Rambaldi's design.\n\nCultural tracking appears to discredit a simple extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) as an explanation of UFOs. The psychosocial hypothesis (PSH) rejects the idea that UFOs are alien craft, and posits the simplest explanation: the UFOs and their occupants are imaginary. However, some believers in alien visitation embraced the idea of cultural tracking, claiming that advanced \"ultraterrestrials\" are capable of deliberately changing how they appear to humans. Advocates of this \"interdimensional hypothesis\" (IDH) believe that these beings might sometimes present themselves in the manner of 1950s sci-fi, but they could also appear as fairies, angels, ghosts or any other supernatural beings. However, they may disagree as to the aliens' motives for doing this. Jacques Vallee in the book \"Passport to Magonia\", and John Keel, in his 1970 book \"Operation Trojan Horse\", are sometimes seen as the instigators of this trend.\n\n"}

While it is referred to as a \"palace\" because of its intended use as the retirement residence of Diocletian, the term can be misleading as the structure is massive and more resembles a large fortress: about half of it was for Diocletian's personal use, and the rest housed the military garrison.\n\nDiocletian built the massive palace in preparation for his retirement on 1 May 305 AD. It lies in a bay on the south side of a short peninsula running out from the Dalmatian coast, four miles from Salona, the capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia. The terrain slopes gently seaward and is typical karst, consisting of low limestone ridges running east to west with marl in the clefts between them.\n\nAfter the Romans abandoned the site, the Palace remained empty for several centuries. In the 7th century, nearby residents fled to the walled palace in an effort to escape invading Croats. Since then the palace has been occupied, with residents making their homes and businesses within the palace basement and directly in its walls. Today many restaurants and shops, and some homes, can still be found within the walls.\n\nAfter the Middle Ages the palace was virtually unknown in the rest of Europe until the Scottish neo-classical architect Robert Adam had the ruins surveyed and, with the aid of French artist and antiquary Charles-Louis Clérisseau and several draughtsmen, published \"Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian at Spalatro in Dalmatia\" (London, 1764).\n\nDiocletian's palace was an inspiration for Adam's new style of Neoclassical architecture and the publication of measured drawings brought it into the design vocabulary of European architecture for the first time. A few decades later, in 1782, the French painter Louis-François Cassas created drawings of the palace, published by Joseph Lavallée in 1802 in the chronicles of his voyages.\n\nThis palace is today, with all the most important historical buildings, in the centre of the city of Split. Diocletian's Palace far transcends local importance because of its degree of preservation. The Palace is one of the most famous and complete architectural and cultural features on the Croatian Adriatic coast. As the world's most complete remains of a Roman palace, it holds an outstanding place in Mediterranean, European and world heritage.\n\nIn November 1979 UNESCO, in line with the international convention on cultural and natural heritage, adopted a proposal that the historic city of Split built around the Palace should be included in the register of World Cultural Heritage.\n\nIn November 2006 the City Council decided to permit over twenty new buildings within the palace (including a shopping and garage complex), although the palace had been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Monument. It is said that this decision was politically motivated and largely due to lobbying by local property developers. Once the public in 2007 became aware of the project, they petitioned against the decision and won. No new buildings, shopping center or the underground garage was built.\n\nThe World Monuments Fund has been working on a conservation project at the palace, including surveying structural integrity and cleaning and restoring the stone and plasterwork.\n\nThe palace is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 500 kuna banknote, issued in 1993.\n\nThe ground plan of the palace is an irregular rectangle (approximately 160 meters x 190 meters) with towers projecting from the western, northern, and eastern facades. It combines qualities of a luxurious villa with those of a military camp, with its huge gates and watchtowers. The palace is enclosed by walls, and at times, it housed over 9000 people. Subterranean portions of the palace feature barrel vaulted stonework.\n\nOnly the southern facade, which rose directly from or very near to the sea, was unfortified. The elaborate architectural composition of the arcaded gallery on its upper floor differs from the more severe treatment of the three shore facades. A monumental gate in the middle of each of these walls led to an enclosed courtyard. The southern sea gate (the \"Porta Aenea\") was simpler in shape and dimensions than the other three, and it is thought that it was originally intended either as the emperor's private access to the sea, or as a service entrance for supplies.\n\nThe design is derived from both villa and castrum types, and this duality is also evident in the arrangement of the interior. The transverse road (decumanus) linking the eastern gate (the Silver Gate or \"Porta argentea\") and western gate (the Iron Gate or \"Porta ferrea\") divided the complex into two-halves. In the southern half were the more luxurious structures; that is, the emperor's apartments, both public and private, and religious buildings. The emperor's apartments formed a block along the sea front and were situated above a substructure because the sloping terrain demanded significant differences in level. Although for many centuries almost completely filled with refuse, most of the substructure is well preserved, and indicates the original shape and disposition of the rooms above.\n\nA monumental court, called the Peristyle, formed the northern access to the imperial apartments. It also gave access to Diocletian's mausoleum on the east (now Cathedral of St. Domnius), and to three temples on the west (two of which are now lost, and the third became a baptistery, originally being the temple of Jupiter). There is a temple just to the west of the Peristylum called The Temple of Aesculapius, which has a semicylindrical roof, made out of hand carved stone blocks, which did not leak until the 1940s, and was then covered with a lead roof. The temple was restored recently.\n\nThe northern half of the palace, divided in two parts by the main north-south street (\"cardo\") leading from the Golden Gate (\"Porta aurea\") to the Peristyle, is less well preserved. It is usually supposed that each part was a residential complex, housing soldiers, servants, and possibly some other facilities. Both parts were apparently surrounded by streets. Leading to perimeter walls there were rectangular buildings, possibly storage magazines.\n\nThe Palace is built of white local limestone and marble of high quality, most of which was from Brač marble quarries on the island of Brač, of tuff taken from the nearby river beds, and of brick made in Salonitan and other factories. Some material for decoration was imported: Egyptian granite columns, fine marble for revetments and some capitals produced in workshops in the Proconnesos. The Palace was decorated with numerous 3500-year-old granite sphinxes, originating from the site of Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III. Only three have survived the centuries. One is still on the Peristyle, the second sits headless in front of Jupiter's temple, and a third is in the city museum.\n\nDiocletian's Palace was used as a location for filming the fourth season of the HBO series \"Game of Thrones\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is distinct from the promulgation of bogus or unrecognised diagnoses.\n\nThe term “monger” has ancient roots, providing the basis for many common compound forms such as cheesemonger, fishmonger, and fleshmonger for those who peddle such wares respectively. “Disease mongering” as a label for the \"invention\" or promotion of diseases in order to capitalize on their treatment was first used in 1992 by health writer Lynn Payer, who applied it to the Listerine mouthwash campaign against halitosis (bad breath).\n\nPayer defined disease mongering as a set of practices which include the following:\n\n\nThe incidence of conditions not previously defined as illness being medicalised as \"diseases\" is difficult to scientifically assess due to the inherent social and political nature of the definition of what constitutes a disease, and what aspects of the human condition should be managed according to a medical model. For example, halitosis, the condition which prompted Payer to coin the phrase \"disease mongering\", isn't merely an imagined social stigma but can stem from any of a wide spectrum of conditions spanning from bacterial infection of the gums to kidney failure, and is recognized by the Scientific Council of the American Dental Association as \"a recognizable condition which deserves professional attention\".\n\nAustralian journalist Ray Moynihan has argued that the pharmaceutical industry engages in disease mongering to enlarge its profits, and that it harms patients. His use of osteoporosis as an example of a \"made up\" disease in this article prompted an angry retort from the president of the British National Osteoporosis Society, stating that the article was insulting to people with osteoporosis and vastly understated the risk of disabling fractures associated with the disorder. Moynihan published a satire of disease mongering in the 2006 April Fool's Day issue of BMJ titled \"Scientists find new disease: motivational deficiency disorder\".\n\nOther conditions which have been cited as examples of disease mongering include restless leg syndrome, testosterone deficiency, erectile dysfunction, hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Some of these conditions are recognized as medical disorders by professional medical societies and the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence. In 2014 an FDA advisory committee voted to limit the use of testosterone replacement therapy products due to potentially increased cardiovascular risk associated with their use.\n\nA 2006 Newcastle, New South Wales international conference, reported in \"PLoS Medicine\", explored the phenomenon of disease mongering.\n\n\n"}

Most date from the early Neolithic (40003000 BC) and were sometimes covered with earth or smaller stones to form a tumulus. Small pad-stones may be wedged between the cap and supporting stones to achieve a level appearance. In many instances, the covering has weathered away, leaving only the stone \"skeleton\" of the mound intact.\n\nIt remains unclear when, why and by whom the earliest dolmens were made. The oldest known are found in Western Europe, dating from c 7,000 years ago. Archaeologists still do not know who erected these dolmens, which makes it difficult to know why they did it. They are generally all regarded as tombs or burial chambers, despite the absence of clear evidence for this. Human remains, sometimes accompanied by artefacts, have been found in or close to the dolmens which could be scientifically dated using radiocarbon dating. However, it has been impossible to prove that these remains date from the time when the stones were originally set in place.\n\nThe word \"dolmen\" has an unclear history. The word entered archaeology when Théophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne used it to describe megalithic tombs in his \"Origines gauloises\" (1796) using the spelling \"dolmin\" (the current spelling was introduced about a decade later and had become standard in French by about 1885). The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" does not mention \"dolmin\" in English and gives its first citation for \"dolmen\" from a book on Brittany in 1859, describing the word as \"The French term, used by some English authors, for a cromlech ...\". The name was supposedly derived from a Breton language term meaning \"stone table\" but doubt has been cast on this, and the \"OED\" describes its origin as \"Modern French\". A book on Cornish antiquities from 1754 said that the current term in the Cornish language for a cromlech was \"tolmen\" (\"hole of stone\") and the OED says that \"There is reason to think that this was the term inexactly reproduced by Latour d'Auvergne [sic] as \"dolmen\", and misapplied by him and succeeding French archaeologists to the \"cromlech\"\". Nonetheless it has now replaced cromlech as the usual English term in archaeology, when the more technical and descriptive alternatives are not used.\n\nDolmens are known by a variety of names in other languages, including , Galician and , , Afrikaans and , , , Adyghe Ispun, \"dysse\" (Danish and Norwegian), \"dös\" (Swedish), \"goindol (mordenized word: stacked stone)\", \"dol (stone)\", \"dolmaengi (pebble-stones, varied stones)\", and . Granja is used in Portugal, Galicia, and Spain. The rarer forms \"anta\" and \"ganda\" also appear. In the Basque Country, they are attributed to the \"jentilak\", a race of giants.\n\nThe etymology of the and - with \"Hüne/hune\" meaning \"giant\" - all evoke the image of giants buried (bett/bed/grab = bed/grave)there.

Despite the literal term \"father figure\", the role of a father figure is not limited to the biological parent of a person (especially a child), but may be played by uncles, grandfathers, elder brothers, family friends, or others.\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that positive father figures (whether biological or not) are generally associated with healthy child development, both in boys and in girls.\n\nThe \"International Dictionary of Psychology\" defines \"father figure\" as \"A man to whom a person looks up and whom he treats like a father.\" The \"APA Concise Dictionary of Psychology\" offers a more extensive definition: \"a substitute for a person's biological father, who performs typical paternal functions and serves as an object of identification and attachment. [Father figures] may include such individuals as adoptive fathers, stepfathers, older brothers, teachers and others.\" This dictionary goes on to state that the term is synonymous with father surrogate and surrogate father. The former definition suggests that the term applies to any man, while the latter excludes biological fathers.\n\nAs a primary caregiver, a father or father-figure fills a key role in a child's life. Attachment theory offers some insight into how children relate to their fathers, and when they seek out a separate \"father figure.\" According to a 2010 study by Posada and Kaloustian, the way that an infant models their attachment to their caregiver has a direct impact on how the infant responds to other people. These attachment-driven responses may persist throughout life.\n\nStudies by Parke and Clark-Stewart (2011) and Lamb (2010) have shown that fathers are more likely than mothers to engage in rough-and-tumble play with children.\n\nOther functions a father figure can provide include: helping establish personal boundaries between mother and child; promoting self-discipline, teamwork and a sense of gender identity; offering a window into the wider world; and providing opportunities for both idealisation and its realistic working-through.\n\nStudies have shown that a lack of a father figure in a child's life can have severe negative psychological impacts upon a child's personality and psychology, whereas positive father figures have a significant role in a child's development.\n\n"}

Other writers followed suit and eventually Beethoven was added to the list. The designation \"first\" is added today to avoid confusion with the Second Viennese School.\n\nWith the exception of Schubert, these composers certainly knew each other, with Haydn and Mozart even being occasional chamber-music partners. But they were not engaged in a formal effort to associate with 20th-century schools, such as the Second Viennese School, or Les Six.

Dreger explores the relationship between science and social justice by discussing a number of scientific controversies. These include the debates surrounding intersex genital surgery, autogynephilia, and anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon's work.\n\nThe first part of \"Galileo's Middle Finger\" recounts Dreger's activism against surgical \"correction\" of intersex individuals' genitalia. Some surgeons called this \"total urogenital mobilization\" which is \"...ripping out everything that didn't seem right to the doctor and rebuilding a girl's genitals from scratch using Frankenstein stitches...\" Thus, her book discusses the intersex medical interventions that some intersex children in the United States undergo. Based on her interactions with the intersex community as well as her own research, she advocated that genital surgery for intersex children be postponed until the individual is old enough to make an informed decision, in the absence of any evidence that the benefits of such surgery outweighed its already reported risks.\n\nThe second section provides her analysis of the controversy surrounding \"The Man Who Would Be Queen\" (2003), by sex researcher and psychologist J. Michael Bailey. In that book, Bailey summarized research on Blanchard's transsexualism typology in a way that Dreger says is scientifically accurate, well-intended, and sympathetic, but insensitive to its political implications. Dreger writes that \"Bailey made the mistake of thinking that openly accepting and promoting the truth about people's identities would be understood as the same as accepting them and helping them, as he felt he was\". Instead, many activists in the trans community objected to the contention that their transition was sexually motivated.\n\nBailey's book was based on the academic publications of psychologist Ray Blanchard, which Bailey interpreted for a lay audience. The larger audience and potential to influence public beliefs about transgenderism led a prominent transgender activist, Lynn Conway, to campaign against Bailey. Dreger concludes that the accusations levied against Bailey by Conway and others did not hold up to scrutiny. \"Conway developed what became an enormous Web site hosted by the University of Michigan for the purpose of taking down Bailey and his ideas [and] that largely enabled me to figure out what she had really done and how Bailey had essentially been set up in an effort to shut him up about autogynephilia\". Dreger wrote that some activists had turned their horror at Bailey's findings into a very public vendetta against him and his family, including thinly veiled allegations that he sexually abused his children. After researching the allegations against Bailey, she concluded that they were false. Moreover, Dreger observed that \"the most interesting mail, from my perspective, came from trans women who wrote to tell me that, though they weren't thrilled with Bailey's oversimplifications of their lives, they also had been harassed and intimidated by Andrea James for daring to speak anything other than the politically popular 'I was always just a woman trapped in a man's body' story. They thanked me for standing up to a bully.\"\n\nDreger also investigates the controversy surrounding biologist Randy Thornhill and anthropologist Craig T. Palmer's \"A Natural History of Rape\" (2000) and accusations by Patrick Tierney in his book \"Darkness in El Dorado\" that anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon seriously abused the Yanomamo. She returns to the issue of intersex in an examination of geneticist Maria New's research in prenatal dexamethasone use in cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\n\n\"The New York Times\" described the book as \"a rant, a manifesto, a treasury of evocative new terms (sissyphobia, autogynephilia, phall-o-meter) and an account of the author’s transformation\" from activist to scientist and back again. \"Salon\" describes the book as \"highly readable\" with an important message: \"Science and social justice require each other to be healthy\". The book also received positive reviews from the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\", and gay activist and author Dan Savage. \"Kirkus Reviews\" named it one of the best non-fiction books of 2015.\n\nThe book was at first selected as 2016 finalist for a Lambda Literary Award in the LGBTQ nonfiction category, but the foundation rescinded this nomination on March 22, 2016, describing the book as \"inconsistent with its mission of affirming LGBTQ lives.\" Brynn Tannehill, writing for \"The Advocate\", compared arguments made in the book to the arguments made by anti-transgender groups like the Family Research Council. She wrote that the book promoted a theory that trans people are \"just self-hating homosexual men who believe they could have guilt-free sex if they were female and heterosexual men with an out-of-control fetish (autogynephilia)\". Zinnia Jones, a trans activist writer, criticised the book as providing an \"incomplete and sensationalized\" depiction of the subject which selectively covers claims made by proponents, ignoring those which might present it in a worse light.

As a designation it is used within Freemasonry to represent the deity neutrally (in whatever form, and by whatever name each member may individually believe in). It is also a Rosicrucian conception of God, as expressed by Max Heindel. The concept of the demiurge as a grand architect or a great architect also occurs in gnosticism and other religious and philosophical systems.\n\nHinduism equally hails the creation of undoubtedly wonderful architecture and engineering.\n\nThe concept of God as the Great Architect of the Universe has been used many times within Christianity. An illustration of God as the architect of the universe can be found in a Bible from the Middle Ages and the comparison of God to an architect has been used by Christian apologists and teachers.\n\nThomas Aquinas said in the Summa: \"God, Who is the first principle of all things, may be compared to things created \"as the architect is to things designed\" (\"ut artifex ad artificiata\").\" Commentators have pointed out that the assertion that the Grand Architect of the Universe is the Christian God \"is not evident on the basis of 'natural theology' alone but requires an additional 'leap of faith' based on the revelation of the Bible\".\n\nJohn Calvin, in his \"Institutes of the Christian Religion\" (1536), repeatedly calls the Christian God \"the Architect of the Universe\", also referring to his works as \"Architecture of the Universe\", and in his commentary on Psalm 19 refers to the Christian God as the \"Great Architect\" or \"Architect of the Universe\".\n\nThe concept of a Great Architect of the Universe also occurs in Martinism. Martinist doctrine is that the Great Architect must not be worshipped. Martinists hold that while it is possible to \"invoque\" him, it is not to adore him.\n\nIn the Hindu mythology, Lord Vishvakarman is regarded as the “God of Architecture”. He is the supremo of craftsmanship, perfection engineering. Viśhwákarma (meaning \"all creating\" in Sanskrit) is the deity of the creative power that holds the universe together according to the \"Rigveda\" and is considered to be the original creator, architect, divine engineer of the universe from before the advent of time, also the root concept of the later Upanishadic figures of Brahman and Purusha in the historical Vedic religion.\n\nHindu scriptures describe many of Vishwakarma's architectural accomplishments.\n\nThrough the four yugas (aeons of Hindu mythology), he had built several towns and palaces for the gods. Among them were, in chronological order, Svarga(Heaven) in the Satya Yuga, Lanka in the Treta Yuga, and Dwarka (Krishna's capital) in the Dwapara Yuga.\nMasonic historians such as William Bissey Gary Leazer (quoting \"Coil's Masonic Encyclopaedia\"), and S. Brent Morris, assert that \"the Masonic abbreviation G.A.O.T.U., meaning the Great Architect of the Universe, continues a long tradition of using an allegorical name for the Deity.\" They trace how the name and the abbreviation entered Masonic tradition from the \"Book of Constitutions\" written in 1723 by the Reverend James Anderson. They also note that Anderson, a Calvinist minister, probably took the term from Calvin's usage.\n\nChristopher Haffner's own explanation of how the Masonic concept of a Great Architect of the Universe, as a placeholder for the Supreme Being of one's choice, is given in \"Workman Unashamed\":\nThe Swedish Rite, which has the prerequisite of professing to Christian Faith, uses the form \"The \"Threefold\" Great Architect of the Universe\".\n\nThe Great Architect may also be a metaphor alluding to the godhead potentiality of every individual. \"(God)... That invisible power which all know does exist, but understood by many different names, such as God, Spirit, Supreme Being, Intelligence, Mind, Energy, Nature and so forth.\" In Hermeticism, each and every person has the potential to become God, this idea or concept of God is perceived as internal rather than external. The Great Architect is also an allusion to the observer created universe. We create our own reality; hence we are the architect. Another way would be to say that the mind is the builder.\n\nIn Max Heindel's exposition, the Great Architect of the Universe is the Supreme Being, who proceeds from The Absolute, at the dawn of manifestation.\n\nThe concept of the Great Architect of the Universe occurs in Gnosticism. The demiurge is the Great Architect of the Universe, the God of Old Testament, in opposition to Christ and Sophia, messengers of Gnosis of the True God.\nFor example: Gnostics such as the Nasoræans believe the Pira Rabba is the source, origin, and container of all things, which is filled by the Mânâ Rabbâ, the Great Spirit, from which emanates the First Life. The First Life prays for companionship and progeny, whereupon the Second Life, the Ultra Mkayyema or World-constituting Æon, the Architect of the Universe, comes into being. From this architect come a number of æons, who erect the universe under the foremanship of the Mandâ d'Hayye or gnôsis zoês, the Personified Knowledge of Life.\n\nJames Hopwood Jeans, in his book \"The Mysterious Universe\", also employs the concept of a Great Architect of the Universe, saying at one point \"Lapsing back again into the crudely anthropomorphic language we have already used, we may say that we have already considered with disfavour the possibility of the universe having been planned by a biologist or an engineer; from the intrinsic evidence of his creation, the Great Architect of the Universe now begins to appear as a pure mathematician.\" To that Jinarajadasa adds his observation that the Great Architect is \"also a Grand Geometrician. For in some manner or other, whether obvious or hidden, there seems to be a geometric basis to every object in the universe.\"\n\n"}

Purkey is professor emeritus of counselor education at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and writes prolifically as a catalyst for school improvement. In addition, Dr. John Novak, professor emeritus at Brock University in Ontario, Canada, is a primary contributor to the development of Invitational Theory and Practice, authoring numerous books on the subject and lecturing internationally.\nIE emphasizes the importance of internal knowledge in relation to external connections to the outside world and existing educational systems. A key feature of IE is positive self-concept developed through a school environment that leads to more productivity.\n\nPurkey writes, \"At its heart, Invitational Education is an imaginative act of hope that explains how human potential can be realized. It identifies and changes the forces that defeat and destroy people. Invitational Education is designed to create and enhance human environments that cordially summon people to realize their potential in all areas of worthwhile human endeavor.\" \"Invitational Education asserts that organizations are never neutral. Everything and everybody either adds to or subtracts from an existing culture. Invitational Education offers concrete, practice, safe, successful and democratic solutions for problems that routinely harm organizations and the people within them.\"\n\nInvitational Education recognizes five Domains which comprise everyone and every thing in an organization. The Domains include People, Places, Policies, Programs and Processes. These domains will either build or destroy intellectual, social, physical, emotional and moral potential for stakeholders. Adjusting these domains, Invitational Education's theory and practices have been embedded in schools around the world at all levels, from nursery schools to universities. In addition, Invitational Education has strengthened health care facilities, businesses, non-profits, worship centers and families.\n\nIn \"Visible Learning\", John Hattie's meta-analysis of school improvement research, Hattie writes, \"[Invitational Education] is not 'niceness' at work, but an approach that places much reliance on the teachers and schools to make learning exciting, engaging, and enduring. Where there are school differences, it is these types of effects that are the most powerful.\" Hattie's research determined that many of the most hotly debated school reform efforts had little effect on school improvement, but those which provide in invitation to learn had the most profound effect.\n\nAlso applying Invitational Education are authors Harry and Rosemary Wong. In their book, \"The First Days of School\", the Wongs explain that effective teachers invite their students and their colleagues to learn together. \"An invitation makes a person feel able, responsible and valuable. Effective teachers have the power and the ability to maintain an inviting stance in the classroom.\" \n"}

{"id": "31219980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31219980", "title": "Linguistic distance", "text": "Linguistic distance\n\nLinguistic distance is how different one language or dialect is from another. Although they lack a uniform approach to quantifying linguistic distance between languages, practitioners of linguistics use the concept in a variety of linguistic situations, such as learning additional languages, historical linguistics, language-based conflicts and the effects of language differences on trade.\n\nThe proposed measures used for linguisitic distance reflect varying understandings of the term itself. One approach is based on mutual intelligibility, i.e. the ability of speakers of one language to understand the other language. With this, the higher the linguistic distance, the lower is the level of mutual intelligibility.\n\nBecause cognate words play an important role in mutual intelligibility between languages, these figure prominently in such analyses. The higher the percentage of cognate (as opposed to non-cognate) words in the two languages with respect to one another, the lower is their linguistic distance. Also, the greater the degree of grammatical relatedness (i.e. the cognates mean roughly similar things) and lexical relatedness (i.e. the cognates are easily discernible as related words), the lower is the linguistic distance. As an example of this, the Hindustani word \"pānch\" is grammatically identical and lexically similar (but non-identical) to its cognate Punjabi and Persian word \"panj\" as well as to the lexically dissimilar but still grammatically identical Greek \"pent-\" and English \"five\". As another example, the English \"dish\" and German \"tisch\" 'table' are lexically (phonologically) similar but grammatically (semantically) dissimilar. Cognates in related languages can even be identical in form, but semantically distinct, such as \"caldo\" and \"largo\", which mean respectively 'hot' and 'wide' in Italian but 'broth, soup' and 'long' in Spanish. Using a statistical approach (called lexicostatistics) by comparing each language's mass of words, distances can be calculated between them. In technical terms, what is calculated is the Levenshtein distance. Based on this, one study compared both Afrikaans and West Frisian with Dutch to see which was closer to Dutch. It determined that the Dutch and Afrikaans (mutual distance of 20.9%) were considerably closer than Dutch and West Frisian (mutual distance of 34.2%).\n\nHowever, lexicostatistical methods, which are based on retentions from a common proto-language – and not innovations – are problematic due to a number of reasons, so some linguists argue they cannot be relied upon during the tracing of a phylogenetic tree (for example, highest retention rates can sometimes be found in the opposite, peripheral ends of a language family). Unusual innovativeness or conservativeness of a language can distort linguistic distance and the assumed separation date, examples being Romani language and East Baltic languages respectively. On the one hand, continued adjacency of closely related languages after their separation can make some loanwords 'invisible' (indistinguishable from cognates, see etymological nativization), therefore, from lexicostatistical point of view these languages appear less distant then they actually are (examples being Finnic and Saami languages). On the other hand, strong foreign influence of languages spreading far from their homeland can make them share less inherited words than they should do (examples being Hungarian and Samoyedic languages in the East Uralic branch).\n\nBesides cognates, other aspects that are often measured are similarities of syntax and written forms.\n\nTo overcome the aforementioned problems of the lexicostatistical methods, Donald Ringe, Tandy Warnow and Luay Nakhleh developed a complex phylogenetical method relying on phonological and morphological innovations in 2000s.\n\nA 2004 paper by economists Barry Chiswick and Paul Miller attempted to put forth a metric for linguistic distances that was based on empirical observations of how rapidly speakers of a given language gained proficiency in another one when immersed in a society that overwhelmingly communicated in the latter language. In this study, the speed of English language acquisition was studied for immigrants of various linguistic backgrounds in the United States and Canada.\n\n"}

The series was created by the duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller. It still occasionally airs reruns on Teletoon and was briefly aired by MTV and MTV2 in 2003.\n\nAccording to co-creator Miller the reason for putting historical figures in a school setting was that \"We chose these characters because they're sort of mythic figures, even people with a very limited knowledge of history have some preconceived ideas about them, which is part of the fun.\" Lord adds, \"The point of the whole show is that these people are not living up to their genetic forebears.\" Lord and Miller also explained that the development of the character of Gandhi as a \" party animal\" was because they researched that the young Gandhi was \"immature\" and \"into partying\" before witnessing the suffering in South Africa. Another was the reason why they introduced Ponce De León so late in the show, as a parody of how \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" would bring in characters that were never seen before and then kill them off in a melodramatic fashion.\n\nAbe Lincoln is the clone of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States. He is the main protagonist of the series, and most of the episodes are seen through his point of view. Abe is an average, awkward, naive, shy, clumsy yet kind teenager who feels he is struggling to live up to the legacy of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nHe has been friends with Gandhi since they were babies and also good friends with Joan. Throughout season one Abe desperately pursued Cleopatra, his love interest; at first she used him but he had eventually won her love and becomes her boyfriend starting at the end of the episode \"Sleep of Faith\" in which she agreed to go out with him after he won a drag race (despite the fact Cleo ditched him to be with JFK), they did not start a real relationship until the episode \"Plane Crazy\".\n\nAbe is very skinny and physically weak to complement his weak-willed and indecisive nature and he is claimed to weigh only 104 pounds despite being one of the tallest students in the school. He is often seen to fall into peer pressure despite his moral values. Though intelligent, he is very unaware when it comes to other people's feelings, as he regularly insulted his friend Joan without even realizing it. He has a bitter rivalry with JFK, mostly involving his attempts to win over Cleopatra and a possible joke to one president being Republican and the other Democrat. Another reason for their rivalry is because JFK is secretly angry over how Abe treats Joan on a daily basis in his attempt to win Cleopatra over.\n\nHe is unaware that his best friend Joan of Arc is in love with him, and even when she makes advances upon him or professes her love, he seems obstinately stuck in viewing her as his \"girl friend, not his girlfriend\", even to the point of improbably re-interpreting some of her statements and actions as gestures of friendship or humor(something of which JFK is angry about). In the series finale, Abe realizes his feelings for Joan are more than platonic. However, this was only after Cleopatra had given her an involuntary make-over for the prom and the anger he feels when he finds Joan with JFK. Before, Abe was oblivious to the fact that Cleo is attempting to drive a wedge between him and Joan and Gandhi, who she views as being detrimental to her image. When alone with Cleo, he found himself thinking about Joan more. Eventually, Abe realizes her true nature in driving away his friends and sees Cleo for the shallow person she is inside. After ending his relationship with Cleo, he rushes to Joan's house to tell her the truth of his feelings for her. By the time he got there to tell her, Abe discovers to his dismay that Joan has moved on and is in a relationship with JFK.\n\nHe is 16 years old. He drives a white 1960s-esque Lincoln Continental. He is captain of the basketball team because he is the tallest guy at school and on the cross country team though it is clear he lacks athleticism, and he is the president of the anti-drug club. His famous catchphrase is \"Dinger!\" often said out of great excitement or frustration.\n\nAbe is usually seen wearing a white T-shirt with a blue collar and blue sleeves, long, baggy cargo jeans and sneakers. He is very tall, skinny and gangly. He has messy brown hair and a scruffy black chin-strap beard (without a mustache) and a mole on his left cheek\n\nVoice by Will Forte. \"The Lego Movie\" references Clone High by casting Forte as the voice of Lego Abe Lincoln.\n\nJoan of Arc is the clone of Jeanne d'Arc, the devout 15th century French militant. She is Abe's closest friend and is obviously in love with him (everyone knows it except Abe himself), though his constant ignorance of this causes her a lot of frustration.\n\nIn the episode \"ADD: The Last D Stands for Disorder\" Joan admits to being a \"goth\" and has a very moody, cynical, aloof, sarcastic and angst-ridden personality. She has a tendency to erupt melodramatically into tears, usually when Abe ignores her advances or scores with Cleopatra. She hates Cleopatra considering her to be a bimbo and a snob but develops a special hatred when Cleo starts dating Abe and when she is forced to live with Cleo because her house burnt down. Joan prefers to confide in various characters such as Mr. Butlertron, Gandhi, and Jesus Cristo when she needs emotional support, though she also frequently allows Abe to obliviously confide in her regarding his infatuation with Cleo and their amorous affairs together, much to her emotional detriment.\n\nJoan is also very intelligent, well-read, witty and highly ethical and will speak up for what she believes in, though she is always ignored by the others as they see her as being too \"outspoken\". She serves as an environmentalist, a vegetarian and activist. mated to be attractive, though she does not recognize or emphasize this and dutifully wears an orthodontic retainer. Joan has proven to appeal to the other male characters, notably JFK whom frequently harasses her. Despite this, he is secretly attracted to Joan not only because she is immune to his charms, but also he is the only one who sees more to her as a person than Abe. In the Series Finale after realizing that Abe will never see her more than a friend, JFK comforts Joan and takes her to the prom with him. It's there that she realizes her feelings for JFK and sees more to him than the arrogant jock he usually displays in front of others. When Abe came over to her house to finally tell her the truth that he is in love with her, Joan has moved on and begins a relationship with JFK. \n\nShe is 16 years old. She is an agnostic (she rejects religion but is not disinclined to accepting the existence of God), which puts her at odds with the real Jeanne d'Arc who was a devout Christian (this was once explained by feeling unable to live up to the real Jeanne d'Arc). Joan makes home-movies to express herself artistically. In the episode \"Makeover, Makeover, Makeover\", Abe prints flyers of her in order to get her a date for the prom and the flyer describes her as \"Janeane Garofaloesque\".\n\nJoan's appearance consists of a tight black long-sleeved shirt and tight green cargo pants with black boots. She has pale skin, dark red hair, wears black eye liner, purple lipstick and a black choker around her neck. When Cleo gave her a makeover, she wore a different hairstyle, purple eyeshadow and eyeliner, red lipstick a tight black sleeveless leather minidress with a black and red, lacey pushup bra being revealed, fishnet stockings and higheels to highlight her shapely physique. In her original design, she had black hair.\n\nVoice by Nicole Sullivan.\n\nGandhi is the clone of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the Indian activist of the Indian Revolution. Gandhi is a hyperactive, funny, talkative, immature and rather mischievous teenager who wants to be accepted by those around him.\n\nThe reason for his often-ridiculous behavior and underachieving in academics is because he thinks he cannot live up to the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi. Though he has a somewhat likable and friendly personality, his outrageous behavior tends to offend and annoy others. He is a close friend of Abe and at times a confidant to Joan when he is not annoying her. Gandhi knows Joan likes Abe but does not say anything for Joan's privacy.\n\nGandhi believes he is a friend of the popular students and he especially wants to be best friends with JFK in order to be popular by association. He and JFK had three episodes in which they interacted, JFK admitted that he liked Gandhi as a friend in the episode \"Makeover, Makeover, Makeover\". Gandhi also erroneously believes himself to be a ladies man though no females are attracted to him except for Marie Curie but he did gain the attraction of several ladies when he briefly got a makeover as \"GFK\". In the series finale, Gandhi realizes his feelings for Marie and they begin a platonic relationship.\n\nIt is revealed that he used to be Cleo's foster brother for 10 years until she told her parents that he was hurting her image so he was disowned and later placed in the care of new foster parents, a stereotypical Jewish couple (despite the fact that Gandhi donated his kidney to Cleo when she was in terrible pain, something she seems to ignore). He is 16 years old. He is also very short for his age much to his own dismay (even having to use a booster seat when riding in a car). His favorite movie is \"American Pie\" and according to the 2003 MTV website, he is the associate editor of the school newspaper \"The Tatler\" in which he reviews movies. Gandhi is called by various nicknames notably \"G-spot\" and \"G-force\". He also is school's mascot DNA Dan and the treasurer for the Solid Gandhi Dancers.\n\nGandhi appearance consist of a gray short-sleeved shirt with a red stripe, blue jeans and white and red sneakers. He stands very short, is very skinny (almost to the point of looking emaciated) and has dark, swarthy skin. He is bald, wears glasses and has a black mustache and beard. He also wears a gold earring on his right ear.\n\nHis portrayal as a party animal enraged many in India, including prominent members of India's parliament.\n\nVoice by actor Michael McDonald.\n\nCleopatra Smith is the clone of Cleopatra VII, the last Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt. Cleopatra or \"Cleo\" is a beautiful, intelligent and popular student who is more commonly known as Abe's initial love interest.\n\nShe is a very selfish, snobby, cynical, vain, manipulative, pretentious and materialistic stereotypical school diva who cares only about her social image, beauty and popularity. She shows very little consideration for other people's feelings and believes she deserves to be treated like a queen among her peers. She is also an overachiever who frequently covets success in order to fit into her \"queen bee\" status. It is shown that she acts the way she does out of intense insecurity, and because she has an abusive foster mother who openly harbors contempt towards Cleo. She used to date JFK, but only because she thought he was good for her image.\n\nShe became Abe's girlfriend since the episode \"Plane Crazy\". Cleo is portrayed as seductive, hedonistic and libidinous, as result she is sexually promiscuous and hates it when people make of fun of it, especially when Joan does it to spite her. Cleo has always been aware that Joan harbors strong feelings for Abe, and will often warn Joan to stay away from him after she and Abe began dating. When she discovered JFK's feelings for Joan, Cleo encouraged him to pursue her. In the Series Finale, when Abe was about to have sex with Cleo after prom, he begins to realize his feelings for Joan. After seeing how Cleo had been mistreating both her and Gandhi, Abe ends his relationship to her and leaves.\n\nDespite her arrogance and mean-spirited nature she shows a limited ability of compassion as she willingly gave Joan a makeover to help boost her confidence, she gave up some of her vanity to date the obviously unpopular student Abe Lincoln and consoled JFK when he was sad about Poncey's death.\n\nShe is 16 years old. She is captain of the cheerleading team and is the Campus Life editor for \"The Tatler\" in which she interviews students and guest stars. Her physical appearance is derived from the wall paintings of Ancient Egyptian women. She is portrayed as being a tan Egyptian girl which contradicts with the fact the real Cleopatra was of Macedonian descent.\n\nCleo wears a blue (sometimes red or orange depending on her outfit) headband, a white tank top which shows her large cleavage and a tight black miniskirt to show her volumptuous figure and wears pumps. At night she sleeps in sexy purple lingerie and is sometimes seen in her cheerleading uniform at school. At the prom she wore a tight, revealing and seductive red dress and a black minidress at Poncey's funeral.\n\nVoice by actress Christa Miller, the wife of Clone High producer Bill Lawrence.\n\nJFK is the clone of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States. JFK is the stereotypical popular high school jock. He is arrogant, competitive, lecherous, vain and at times dimwitted. He initially antagonized Abe and Gandhi but he later befriends them by the end of the series. However, JFK and Abe maintained a bitter rivalry, mainly due to them wanting to win over Cleopatra over in the early episodes. This later changed when JFK realizes that he is in love with Joan and despises the way Abe callously treats her by ignoring her feelings for him.\n\nIt is shown in episodes \"Episode Two: Election Blue-galoo\" and in \"Raisin the Stakes\", that JFK is a very good speaker. He speaks with a thick, stereotypical, non-rhotic New England dialect and a Boston accent (a parody of the Kennedy accent) that is exaggerated and monotone for a comical effect (he usually switches \"-er\" suffix with \"-ah\" and also uses \"er\" and \"uh\" as filler which occur during mid-sentence). Despite his apparent macho exterior he is very sensitive, emotional and easily offended. JFK is known for his narcissism and his libido. He also has a penchant for using dirty jokes and innuendo. Despite this, JFK has been known to be very compassionate towards others.\n\nDespite being accident-prone, a target of physical harm and losing his best friend Poncey to a freak accident: he does not believe in the Kennedy curse - \"Nothing bad ever happens to the Kennedys\" and \"I'm a Kennedy, I'm not accustomed to tragedy\". His plan of living up to John F. Kennedy is simply by being a womanizer and he is shown to be attractive to women, he seems not to know much about his clonefather besides that he conquered the moon. It is shown that he likes Joan, which is possibly because she is one of the few girls that is immune to his charm. Another reason why JFK likes her is because she is more compassionate and has always seen more to her than Abe did. In the Series Finale, he comforts Joan and takes her to the prom with his other prom dates. However, they leave him when they realize JFK and Joan are in love with each other. It is at prom and later at Joan's home that they begin a relationship, much to Abe's detest.\n\nHe is 16 years old. He mainly drives a yellow van but in the episode \"Sleep of Faith\" drove a 1950s-esque corvette which was destroyed. He also seems to have a fear of sudden movements and friendly \"hand gun\" gestures as he constantly ducks, probably as a cruel joke about the John F. Kennedy assassination. He questioned his sexuality when he became attracted to \"John Dark\" (Joan in drag). He is the captain of the football team and soccer team. When he gets hit by Joan, he yells out \"Bobby!\", a reference to Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nJFK is seen wearing a red sweater with a white stripe in the center and on his sleeves, over a white shirt and tight khaki pants with brown loafers. He has tall, full brown hair and has a fit and muscular physique. His eyes are usually half-open but will get bigger whenever he is shocked, angered or upset. He appears as very healthy even though the real John F. Kennedy suffered a variety of sicknesses from birth (including Addison's disease).\n\nVoice by Christopher Miller. Miller had to study the speeches of John F. Kennedy in order to perfect the voice and the accent.\n\nPrincipal Cinnamon J. Scudworth, Ph.D. is a deluded, self-aggrandizing megalomaniac of a scientist who always wears rubber dish-gloves and if absolutely horrible at being a principal, he is always trying to betray the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures and use the clones for his own convoluted schemes, his favorite being a clone themed amusement park.\n\nHe is shown to have very little control over his emotions and is prone to violent outbursts. It's possible he is an atheist because he once said \"so, religion is for fools?...fools and liberals\". As seen in the opening theme, there is a photo of him and Mr. Butlertron salvaging the remains of Abraham Lincoln, which implies that he was the one along with Mr. B who had dug the corpses of the people in the mid-1980s who would later be used in the cloning experiment.\n\nScudworth apparently had a son named \"Brian Parker Scudworth\" who he bet in a basketball game against the principal of GESH and lost, as a result Brian ended up getting eaten.\n\nHe is seen wearing glasses, a long white lab coat, yellow rubber gloves (which he never takes off), underneath his coat are black pants and shoes. He has brown hair with a bald spot and a small soul patch under his lower lip.\n\nVoice by Phil Lord.\n\nMr. Lynn Butlertron is the loyal robot servant and best friend/roommate to Scudworth who is programmed with a highly sensitive compassion protocol (a parody of Mr. Belvedere). Also known as Mr. B. He calls everyone \"Wesley\", a reference to the youngest son on Mr. Belvedere, Wesley Owens. Strangely, even though he is a robot, Mr. Butlertron is shown without his mustache in a photograph taken in the 80s in the opening to the show and he also has chest hair and armpit hair as shown when he took off his red cardigan sweater vest. Though he is usually polite and laid-back, he does have a temper which came out when had a fight with Scangrade and when he showed jealousy towards Ecybo Pooch.\n\nMr. Butlertron is very human-like being programmed to be highly sentient (though its unknown on how he can feel physical sensations) and possesses artificial intelligence that which enables him to show human emotions, have free will and have facial expressions. He genuinely cares for Scudworth and the students.\n\nVoice by Christopher Miller.\n\nThe Secret Board of Shadowy Figures is a ruthless and secretive government organization who employs Principal Scudworth and is sponsored by Puma. They appear as a parody of the CIA, Secret Service, NSA and Area 51. They were responsible for the creation of the clones in the mid-80's. Their ultimate aim is to use the clones for a super army. The organization consists primarily of aged white male agents.\n\nIts chief director is referred to as The Shadowy Figure (voiced by Bill Lawrence). He is aware of Scudworth's craziness and incompetence in running Clone High. Though for the most part, he has shown amnesty as he gave Scudworth numerous times to redeem himself. He finally decides to kill Scudworth and takes the clones away for experimentation after discovering his video tape of his plot to betray the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures and create \"Cloney Island\". He also secretly hired many celebrities to spy on the clones and Scudworth. He may be lactose intolerant.\n\nThey all wear blue paramilitary uniforms complete with ribbon bars and in the \"Episode Two\" they are seen wearing Pumas sneakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Clone High\" is praised for its high character development and strong voice acting. Charles Soloman of the LA Times wrote that, \"Will Forte's ingenuous Abraham Lincoln and Nicole Sullivan's resigned Joan of Arc steal the show.\"\n"}

His party constantly opposed the unelected colonial government, and in 1828 he helped draft an early form of the resolutions, essentially a list of grievances against the colonial administration. To ensure that the views of the Legislative Assembly be understood by the British House of Commons, the \"Parti patriote\" had sent its own delegation to London in order to submit a memoir and a petition signed by 87,000 people.\n\nOn February 28, 1834, Papineau presented the Ninety-Two Resolutions to the Legislative Assembly which were approved and sent to London. The resolutions included, among other things, demands for an elected Legislative Council and an Executive Council responsible before the house of representatives. Under the Constitutional Act of 1791, the government of Lower Canada was given an elected legislative assembly, but members of the upper houses were appointed by the Governor of the colony. \n\nIn the resolutions, the elected representatives once again reiterated their loyalty to the British Crown, but expressed frustration that the government of London had been unwilling to correct the injustices caused by the past governments of the colony.\n\nPapineau's resolutions were ignored for almost three years; meanwhile, the Legislative Assembly did all it could to oppose the un-elected upper houses while avoiding outright rebellion.

{"id": "262299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=262299", "title": "Nonchord tone", "text": "Nonchord tone\n\nA nonchord tone (NCT), nonharmonic tone, or embellishing tone is a note in a piece of music or song that is not part of the implied or expressed chord set out by the harmonic framework. In contrast, a chord tone is a note that is a part of the functional chord (see: factor (chord)). Nonchord tones are most often discussed in the context of the common practice period of classical music, but they can be used in the analysis of other types of tonal music as well, such as Western popular music.\n\nNonchord tones are often categorized as \"accented nonchord tones\" and \"unaccented nonchord tones\" depending on whether the dissonance occurs on an accented or unaccented beat (or part of a beat).\n\nOver time, some musical styles assimilated chord types outside of the common-practice style. In these chords, tones that might normally be considered nonchord tones are viewed as chord tones, such as the seventh of a minor seventh chord. For example, in 1940s-era bebop jazz, playing an F with a C chord, woud be considered a chord tones if the chord were analyzed as C. In European classical music, \"[t]he greater use of dissonance from period to period as a result of the dialectic of linear/vertical forces led to gradual normalization of ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords [in analysis and theory]; each additional non-chord tone above the foundational triad became frozen into the chordal mass.\"\n\nChord and nonchord tones are defined by their membership (or lack of membership) in a chord: \"The pitches which make up a chord are called \"chord-tones\": any other pitches are called \"non-chord-tones\".\" They are also defined by the time at which they sound: \"\"Nonharmonic tones\" are pitches that sound along with a chord but are not chord pitches.\" For example, if an excerpt from a piece of music implies or uses a C-major chord, then the notes C, E and G are members of that chord, while any other note played at that time (e.g., notes such as F) is a nonchord tone. Such tones are most obvious in homophonic music but occur at least as frequently in contrapuntal music.\n\nAccording to \"Music in Theory and Practice,\" \"Most nonharmonic tones are dissonant and create intervals of a second, fourth or seventh\", which are required to resolve to a chord tone in conventional ways. If the note fails to resolve until the next change of harmony, it may instead create a seventh chord or extended chord. While theoretically in a three-note chord, there are nine possible nonchord tones in equal temperament, in practice nonchord tones are usually in the prevailing key. Augmented and diminished intervals are also considered dissonant, and all nonharmonic tones are measured from the bass note, or lowest note sounding in the chord except in the case of nonharmonic bass tones.\n\nNonharmonic tones generally occur in a pattern of three pitches, of which the nonharmonic tone is the center:\n\nNonchord tones are categorized by how they are used. The most important distinction is whether they occur on a strong or weak beat and are thus either accented or unaccented nonchord tones. They are also distinguished by their direction of approach and departure and the voice or voices in which they occur and the number of notes they contain.\n\nAn \"anticipation\" (ANT) occurs when this note is approached by step and then remains the same. It is basically a note of the second chord played early. In the example below, the dissonant B in bar 1 is approached by step and resolves when that same pitch becomes a chord tone in bar 2.\n\n</score>\n\nA \"portamento\" is the late Renaissance precursor to the anticipation, though today it refers to a glissando.\n\n</score>\n\nA \"neighbor tone\" (NT) or \"auxiliary note\" (AUX) is a nonchord tone that passes stepwise from a chord tone directly above or below it (which frequently causes the NT to create dissonance with the chord) and resolves to the same chord tone:\n\n</score>\n\nIn practice and analysis, neighboring tones are sometimes differentiated depending upon whether or not they are lower or higher than the chord tones surrounding them. A neighboring tone that is a step higher than the surrounding chord tones is called an \"upper neighboring tone\" or an \"upper auxiliary note\" while a neighboring tone that is a step lower than the surrounding chord tones is a \"lower neighboring tone\" or \"lower auxiliary note\". However, following Heinrich Schenker's usage in \"Free Composition\", some authors reserve the term \"neighbor note\" to the lower neighbor a half step below the main note.\n\nThe German term \"Nebennote\" is a somewhat broader category, including all nonchord tones approached from the main note by step.\n\nAn \"escape tone\" (ET) or \"echappée\" is a particular type of unaccented incomplete neighbor tone that is approached stepwise from a chord tone and resolved by a skip in the opposite direction back to the harmony.\n\n</score>\n\nA \"passing tone\" (PT) or \"passing note\" is a nonchord tone prepared by a chord tone a step above or below it and resolved by continuing in the same direction stepwise to the next chord tone (which is either part of the same chord or of the next chord in the harmonic progression).\n\n</score>\n\nWhere two nonchord tones are before the resolution they are \"double passing tones\" or \"double passing notes\".\n\nAs with above but on an accented beat.\n\n</score>\n\nA neighbor tone where you step up or down from the chord tone, and then move back to the chord tone.\n\n</score>\n\nA \"suspension\" (SUS) (sometimes referred to as a \"syncope\") occurs when the harmony shifts from one chord to another, but one or more notes of the first chord (the preparation) are either temporarily held over into or are played again against the second chord (against which they are nonchord tones called the \"suspension\") before resolving downwards to a chord tone by step (the resolution). The whole process is called a \"suspension\" as well as the specific nonchord tone(s).\n\nSuspensions may be further described with two numbers: (1) the interval between the suspended note and the bass note and (2) the interval between the resolution and the bass note. The most common suspensions are 4-3 suspension, 7-6 suspension, or 9-8 suspension. Note that except for the 9-8 suspensions, the numbers are typically referred to using the simple intervals, so for instance, if intervals are actually an 11th and a 10th (the first example below), you would typically call it a \"4-3 suspension\". If the bass note is suspended, then the interval is calculated between the bass and the part that is most dissonant with it, often resulting in a 2-3 suspension.\n\n</score>\n\nSuspensions must resolve downwards. If a tied note is prepared like a suspension but resolves upwards, it is called a \"retardation\". Common retardations include 2-3 and 7-8 retardations. \n\n</score>\n\nDecorated suspensions are common and consist of portamentos or double eighth notes, the second being a lower neighbor tone.\n\n</score>\n\nA chain of suspensions constitutes the fourth species of counterpoint; an example may be found in the second movement of Arcangelo Corelli's \"Christmas Concerto\".]\n\nAn \"appoggiatura\" (APP) is a type of accented incomplete neighbor tone approached skip-wise from one chord tone and resolved stepwise to another chord tone (\"overshooting\" the chord tone).\n\n</score>\n\n\"Nonharmonic bass\" notes are bass notes that are not a member of the chord below which they are written. Examples include the Elektra chord. An example of a nonharmonic bass from the third movement of Stravinsky's \"Symphony of Psalms\".\n\n</score>\n\n\"Changing tones\" (CT) are two successive nonharmonic tones. A chord tone steps to a nonchord tone which skips to another nonchord tone which leads by step to a chord tone, often the same chord tone. They may imply neighboring tones with a missing or implied note in the middle. Also called \"double neighboring tones\" or \"neighbor group\".\n\n</score>\n\nAnother form of nonchord tone is a \"pedal point\" or \"pedal tone\" (PD) or \"note\", almost always the tonic or dominant, which is held through a series of chord changes. The pedal point is almost always in the lowest voice (the term originates from organ playing), but it may be in an upper voice; then it may be called an \"inverted pedal\". It may also be between the upper and lower voices, in which case it is called an \"internal pedal\".\n\n</score>\n\nA \"chromatic nonharmonic tone\" is a nonharmonic tone that is chromatic, or outside of the key and creates half-step motion. The use of which, especially \"chromatic appoggiaturas\" and \"chromatic passing tones\", increased in the Romantic Period. The example below shows chromatic nonharmonic tones (in red) in the first four measures of Frédéric Chopin's Prelude No. 21, op. 28.\n\n</score>\n\n"}

Choirs from various regions of Poland and Polish diaspora, groups from Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have participated in it massively.

{"id": "6540851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6540851", "title": "Slovakization", "text": "Slovakization\n\nSlovakization or Slovakisation is a form of forced cultural assimilation process during which non-Slovak nationals give up their culture and language in favor of the Slovak one. This process has relied most heavily on intimidation and harassment by state authorities. In the past the process has been greatly aided by deprivation of collective rights for minorities and ethnic cleansing, but in the last decades its promotion has been limited to the adoption of anti-minority policies and anti-minority hate speech.\n\nThe process itself is limited mostly to Slovakia, where Slovaks constitute the absolute majority by means of population and legislation power as well. Slovakization is most often used in relation to Hungarians, who constitute the most prominent minority of Slovakia, but it also affects Germans, Poles, Ukrainians, Rusyns (Ruthenians), and Jews.\n\nThe process of slovakization was present in the Kingdom of Hungary presumably ever since the appearance of the Slovak nation itself, but up until the foundation of Czechoslovakia the process was entirely voluntary. This early form of slovakization can be observed in detail in noble families' personal correspondence. Another example of pre-World War I Slovakization is the assimilation of the Habans, a Hutterite group settled in the Nagylévárd (today's Veľké Leváre) area in the 16th century, into the Slovak majority.\n\nThe accelerated, forced nature of slovakization began with the defeat of the remaining Hungarian armies in 1919, which laid foundations to the creation of Czechoslovakia, a state in which the Slovaks have gained a \"de facto\" political power for the first time in the nation's history. The Paris Peace Conference concluded by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920 set the southern border of Czechoslovakia for strategic and economic reasons much further south than the Slovak-Hungarian language border. Consequently, fully Hungarian-populated areas were annexed to the newly created state.\n\nCzechoslovakia provided a large education network for the Hungarian minority. Hungarians, for example, had 31 kindergartens, 806 elementary schools, 46 secondary schools, 576 Hungarian libraries at schools in the 1930s and a Department of Hungarian literature was created at the Charles University of Prague. The number of Hungarian elementary schools increased from 720 in 1923/1924 to the above number 806. The Hungarian University in Bratislava/Pozsony was immediately closed after formation of Czechoslovakia \n\nAccording to the 1910 census conducted by the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, there were 884,309 people with Hungarian as a mother tongue, constituting 30.2% of the population, in what is now Slovakia compared to the 9.7% number recorded in the 2001 census, amounting to a 3 fold decrease in the percentage of Hungarians. The first Slovak census in 1919 in what is now Slovakia recorded 689,565 Hungarians constituting 23.59% of the population. According to the first Czechoslovak census in 1921 there were 650,597 Hungarians in Slovakia, constituting 21.68% of the population. The Czechoslovak census of 1930 recorded 571,952 Hungarians. All censuses from the period are disputed, and some give conflicting data for example in Kosice according to the Czechoslovak censuses 15-20% of the population was Hungarian. However, during the parliamentary elections the Ethnic Hungarian parties got 35-45% of the total votes (excluding those Hungarians who voted for the Communists or the Social democrats). The whole matter is complicated by the fact that there was a high percentage of bilingual and similarly \"Slovak-Hungarian\" persons who could claim being both Slovak and Hungarian.\n\nSlovak sources usually do not deny that many Hungarian teachers (replaced in Slovak schools by Slovak and Czech teachers), railwaymen (on strike against new Czechoslovak republic in February 1919), postmen, policemen, soldiers and civil clerks (replaced by Czech and Slovak soldiers, policemen and clerks) were forced to leave or left for Hungary voluntarily, the numbers however are unclear but census do show a rapid decline in the number of people with Hungarian as a mother tongue. Some teachers and civil servants were expelled from Czechoslovakia while some left due to the harsh circumstances. There are many examples of Hungarians who were forced to leave their homes from this territory (two famous ones are the families of Béla Hamvas, and of Albert Szent-Györgyi). The high number of refugees (and even more from Romania) necessitated entire new housing projects in Budapest (Mária-Valéria telep, Pongrácz-telep), which gave shelter to refugees numbering at least in the ten-thousands.\n\nUnder the Austro-Hungarian Empire there was strong anti-Hungarian sentiment among certain sections of the Czech and Slovak population and unsurprisingly, this persisted to some extent in Czechoslovakia once it was formed. It seemed to hit the city of Pressburg (soon to be renamed Bratislava) most intensely. One of the very first measures brought by Samuel Zoch, the newly appointed župan of the city was the forced disbandment of the only Hungarian university in Czechoslovakia (Elisabeth Science University), and the intimidation of its professors by the police in 1919, immediately after the formation of the new country. \nMost of the professors and former students then left Pressburg for Budapest (with the university later being re-established in Pécs). Zoch had previously stated \"...but the question of minorities will be fully solved only after our public perception of morality will condemn ethnic oppression just as much as the oppression of religion\". \n\nAccording to Varsik, the university was not closed by the župan because local politicians did not have such powers. Elisabeth University was founded in 1912 and began teaching only in 1914. The university was not the only Hungarian graduate school in the territory of contemporary Slovakia, but it had to serve to also all students from Upper Hungary inhabited by Slovak majority. However, in compliance with the education policy of the Hungarian government, which did not allow Slovak high schools, the university did not even have a Slovak language department. In 1919, a new Czechoslovak university was founded in parallel and adopted space and limited inventory of unfinished faculty of medicine. Hungarian professors refused to promise loyalty to the new state, as was necessary for teachers and state employees, and were retired after being provided financial compensation. Thereafter, the university was closed by official government decree and replaced by Comenius University which remained the only the university in mid-war Slovakia for the majority population.\n\nOn February 3, 1919, the day before the moving of Vavro Šrobár's government to Bratislava, a strike began which affected key infrastructure and sectors of industry. The strike had initially social character. Thereafter, it was politicized and joined with national demands of Hungarian and German workers. On February 12, 1919, Hungarian nationalistic circles exploited a demonstration organized by the Council of Workers. The demonstration went out of control and after a physical attack on the Italian commander Riccardo Barreca, a military patrol dispersed the crowd by shooting, leaving 7 dead and 23 wounded.\nAnother aspect of the anti-Hungarian sentiment was the hatred of all the statues and monuments representing Austria-Hungary or Hungarian historical people. National socialist MPs of the Czechoslovak National Assembly called for the conservation of such works of art, moving and preserving them in suitable places as early as 1920. The hatred however was not limited to sculptures only: Hungarian books were burned in Poprad and possibly other locations as well. Concurrently some of the statues were destroyed as well: the millennium monument along with the Árpád statue in Devín was blown up using dynamite. The statue of Maria Theresa in Bratislava (pictured) was preserved until October 1921 when information about attempts to restore monarchy spread in successor states of Austro-Hungarian Empire. In the atmosphere of partial mobilization, martial law and fresh memories to invasion by Béla Kun's army, it was brought down using ropes tied to trucks. In Slovakia, memorials were destroyed mainly after intervention of Red Guards of Béla Kun in spring and summer 1919, when statues of Lajos Kossuth were destroyed in Rožňava, Lučenec, Dobšiná and Nové Zámky, as well as a statue of Ferenc Rákóczi in Brezno and numerous others. In almost all of these cases the perpetrators were soldiers of the Czechoslovakian legion. The idleness of state authorities encouraged destroyers of statues. The government started to act only when the mob had begun to take over shops and properties of German entrepreneurs. Thereafter, Czechoslovak army and police intervened and destruction of symbols of monarchy stopped for nearly a year.\n\nIn the revolutionary period between the creation of Czechoslovakia and the first free parliamentary elections in 1920, legislative power was held by temporary, the revolutionary (un-elected) Czechoslovak National Council (later The Czechoslovak National Assembly). The revolutionary parliament without participation of minorities also adopted a new constitution. The constitution guaranteed equal rights for all citizens regardless of gender, nationality or religion. In comparison with the previous state in the Kingdom of Hungary it also extended political rights to individuals of Hungarian nationality, by introducing universal suffrage, removing voting criteria based on property size and benefits based on titles and functions or education (typical for previous Hungarian elections) and granted full women's suffrage (including for Hungarian women), which was not introduced in Hungary until 1945.\n\nLater on, all minorities gained the right to use their languages in municipalities where they constituted at least 20% of the population even in communication with government offices and courts.\n\nAccording to Béla Angyal, due to gerrymandering and disproportionate distribution of population between Bohemia and Slovakia the Hungarians had little representation in the National Assembly and thus their influence on the politics of Czechoslovakia remained limited. The same considerations limited the Slovak intelligentsia's political power as well. On the other hand, Hungarians founded numerous parties including pro-Czechoslovak parties, founded parties with agrarian, social-democratic, Christian-socialist and other orientations, were active as sections of statewide Czechoslovak parties, had opportunities to participate in government and in the 1920s Hungarian members of parliament participated in adoption of several important laws with statewide impact.\n\n \nAfter World War II, the size of Hungarian population was decreased by Czechoslovak-Hungarian population exchange and expulsion of Hungarians who came to after the First Vienna Award or committed crimes according to Decree of Slovak National Council No. 33/1945 Zb. about people tribunals. Due to the proclamation of the \"Košice Government Program\", the German and Hungarian population living in the reborn Czechoslovakia were subjected to various forms of persecution, including: expulsions, deportations, internments, peoples court procedures, citizenship revocations, property confiscation, condemnation to forced labour camps, and forced changes of ethnicity referred to as \"reslovakization.\" \nIn 1946 the process of \"Reslovakization\" (or re-Slovakization), the forced acceptance of Slovak ethnicity, was engaged by the Czechoslovak government with the objective of eliminating the Hungarian ethnicity. The Slovak Commissioner of the Interior on June 17, 1946 (decree No.20,000/1946) initiated the \"Reslovakization\" program. This process based upon the Czechoslovak assumption that in fact there never had been any Hungarians in South Slovakia, only \"Hungarianized Slovaks\" who lost their Slovak national identity through the centuries of Hungarian rule. As Anton Granatier, officer of the Resettlement Bureau said: \"„We want to be the national state of Slovaks and Czechs, and we will be. This monumental programme includes re−slovakization, already under way in whole Slovakia! Within the scope of this action everyone who feels to be Slovak by origin will have the chance to declare it freely whether they want to become Slovaks with all its consequences or want to share the fate of those without citizenship.“\" In the spring and summer of 1945, a series of decrees stripped Hungarians of property, from all civil rights and from their citizenship. Hungary itself gave the Slovaks equal rights and demanded the same solution to the issue from Czechoslovakia. Since Hungarians in Slovakia were deprived of many rights, and were the target of discrimination, they were pressured into having their ethnicity officially changed to Slovak, otherwise they dropped out of the pension, social, and healthcare system. 400,000 (sources differ) stateless Hungarians applied for, and eventually 344,609 Hungarians received a re-Slovakization certificate by the Central Committee for Reslovakization, and thereby Czechoslovak citizenship. Therefore, the number of Hungarians in Slovakia dropped to 350000. According to Russian archives, 20000 Hungarians declared themselves as Slovak at the beginning of the year 1949, and eventually 360000 Hungarians changed their ethnicity to Slovak, according to Slovak historians. The fear was so big among the Hungarian population, that only 350000-367000 claimed themselves Hungarian in the 1950 census, and only after ten years -when the reslovakization program was revoked- began to rose and reached 518000.\n\nThe official results of re-slovakization action were summarized in the final report of the Re-slovakization Commission. The commission received 197,916 application forms related to 449,914 people. 83,739 applicants declared Slovak nationality also before 1930 and they were not considered to be re-slovakizants. From the remaining 366,175 candidates, the commission accepted 284,814 and refused 81,361 candidates for various reasons.\n\nAn important issue with the slovakization procedure was, that the \"reslovakized\" Hungarians did not take the forcible change of ethnicity seriously, because it is impossible to force someone to forget his culture and language suddenly. A Slovak journalist wrote the following about the \"reslovaklized\" city of Nové Zámky (): \n\nWith the disappearance of Edvard Beneš from the political scene, the Czechoslovak government issued decree No. 76/1948 on April 13, 1948, allowing those Hungarians still living in Czechoslovakia, to reinstate Czechoslovak citizenship. A year later, Hungarians were allowed to send their children to Hungarian schools, which had been reopened for the first time since 1945, although Hungarians remaining in Slovakia were subjected to extremely heavy pressure to assimilate, and complaints reached Moscow about forced enrollment of Hungarian children in Slovak schools.\n\nMost Slovakized Hungarians gradually readopted their Hungarian ethnicity. As a result, \"The Re-Slovakization Commission\" ceased operations in December 1948.\n\nDespite their promises to settle the issue of the Hungarians in Slovakia, in 1948 Czech and Slovak ruling circles still maintained the hope that they could deport the Hungarians from Slovakia. According to a 1948 poll conducted among the Slovak population 55% were for \"resettlement\" (deportation) of the Hungarians, 24% said \"don't know\", 21% were against. Under slogans for the struggle with class enemies, the process of dispersing dense Hungarian settlements continued in 1948 and 1949. By October 1949 preparations were made to deport 600 Hungarian families.\n\nFinally, on 25 July 1949, Czechoslovak and Hungarian delegations met in Štrbské pleso and signed so-called Štrba protocol () which ended the law disputes between Hungarian and Czechoslovak property and legal question and compensation of deported Hungarians.\n\nIn 2002 before Slovakia and Hungary joined the European Union in 2004, Hungarian politician Viktor Orbán demanded the repeal of the Beneš decrees, but the European Parliament asserted that \"the decrees did not constitute an insurmountable obstacle to accession.\" Slovak politician Monika Beňová-Flašiková accused the Hungarian politicians for pushing \"revanchist\" policies which could destabilize Europe. Later on the Hungarian members of the Slovak parliament requested for compensation and for a symbolic apology to the victims of the expulsions. As an answer, the Slovak government adopted a resolution in September 2007 which declared that the Beneš decrees are inalterable.\n\nCzechoslovakia (being a Socialist country at that time) financed the following purely Hungarian institutions for the Hungarians in Czechoslovakia as of early 1989: 386 kindergartens, 131 elementary schools, 98 secondary schools, 2 theaters, 1 special Hungarian language publishing house (6 publishing houses also publishing Hungarian literature) and 24 newspapers and journals.\nThe first Hungarian-language university in Slovakia was opened only in 2004 - the Selye János University.\n\nAccording to \"The Minorities at Risk Project\":\n\nThe Party of the Hungarian Coalition (SMK) and Most–Híd are the major Hungarian minority parties in Slovak politics. Since 1993 a Hungarian minority party has always been a member of the parliament. As of 2012, a Hungarian minority party spent 10 out of 19 years in government.\n\nUnder Communism, the Hungarian minority issue was confined invariably to the position of Slovaks within the Czechoslovak state, and therefore it was ignored in any systematic way. But the fall of Communism reinforced national identities and demolished the ideology of 'the socialist unity of nations'. The break-up of Czechoslovakia was a process of national redefinition and assertion in Slovakia.\nUnder the premiership of Mečiar prone to populism, exclusivist Slovak nationalism,\nand the use of extralegal measures, independent Slovakia approached\nauthoritarianism. Mečiar turned the Hungarian minority into a scapegoat for Slovakia's bad economic situation. Numerous articles and books containing anti-Hungarian propaganda appeared, and the Hungarians were accused for the destruction of the 'first Slovak state', and for the ‘one-millennium-long oppression’ of Slovak nation.\nDuring the redrawing of the administrative boundaries of Slovakia, Hungarian politicians suggested two models; the so-called 'Komárno proposals'. The first proposal was a full ethnic autonomy of the southern Slovak districts with Hungarian majority, while the second suggestion was to create three counties in southern Slovakia to bring together the main centers of Hungarian population. Although a territorial unit of this name existed before 1918, the borders proposed by SMK were significantly different. The proposed region would have encompassed a very long slice of southern Slovakia, with the explicit aim to create an administrative unit with ethnic-Hungarian majority. Hungarian minority politicians and intellectuals thought that such kind of administrative unit is essential for the long-term survival of the Hungarian minority. Both proposals were rejected by the Slovak government in favour of an eight county model of north-south (and not east-west) governance, which has been seen to weaken the electoral power of Hungarians. According to Miklós Duray, a politician of the Party of the Hungarian Coalition: \"Administrative jurisdictions of Slovakia were geographically modified in a clear case of gerrymandering. The administrative system governed by laws created in 1991, included 17 primary jurisdictions and 2 secondary jurisdictions, with a majority Hungarian population. The 1996 law eliminated this system of administration. In the reorganized system only 2 primary administrative jurisdictions have a Hungarian majority population (Dunajská Streda and Komárno). Furthermore, 8 secondary administrative jurisdictions were created, 5 with Hungarian populations in the 10 to 30 per cent range. In 1998, these jurisdictions had regional self governing communities, where the diminished proportion of Hungarians made certain they played a subordinate role in self government.\" After the regions became autonomous in 2002, SMK was able to take power in the Nitra Region and it became part of the ruling coalition in several other regions.\n\nBefore the Slovak independence two main issues appeared regarding language: the right to use non-Slovakized versions of women's names and the use of bilingual street signs. Non Slovaks were forced to Slovakize female personal names in official documents by attaching the Slovak feminine suffix '-ová'. Members of ethnic minorities were restricted in their choice of given names, as registry offices accepted only names from a limited list only. After ten years wrangling, the second Dzurinda cabinet eased these restrictions.\n\nThe Slovak Constitution from 1992 asserts that the ‘state language’ on the territory of the Slovak Republic is Slovak. At the same time this constitution entails explicit provisions for minorities, including language right. These provisions were reinforced in 2001. International treaties like the \"Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities\" (ratified by Slovakia in 1995) or the \"European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages\" (ratified by Slovakia in 2001) and the \"1995 Treaty on Good Neighbourly Relations and Friendly Cooperations between Slovakia and Hungary\" protect the language rights of minorities. Article 34. of the 1992 constitution asserts that \"\"citizens of ethnic minorities have the right to be educated in their language, the right to use it in dealings with authorities, and the right to participate in the solution of affairs concerning national minorities and ethnic groups\".\" These provisions afford a high standard of protection, but still, these legislative instruments do not warrant the implementation of the postulated rights. In most cases the disfrancishement evolves when there is insufficient political will to legislate the provisions as laws. This happened between 1992 and 1998 (i.e. under Mečiar's government).\nSlovak nationalist demands for a language law detaining the use of Hungarian in public institutions already appeared in 1990. Finally, the Meciar government pushed through legislation restricting the use of minority languages in public institutions. In 1995, the Slovak Parliament passed Act No 270 on the State Language of Slovakia, which came into power on 1 January 1996. This act revoked the more tolerant Act No 428 passed in 1990. The 1995 act emphasized the significance of the Slovak language for Slovak nationalism and statehood, by consolidating the exclusivist monolingualism. The new act considerably limited the use of minority languages, that is, of Hungarian, which had featured on bilingual signposts with placenames in predominantly Hungarian areas, and in bilingual school certificates issued to students in Hungarian minority schools. According to Duray: \"\"An official language law was promulgated providing the legal framework for the official use of the Slovak language not only in official communications but also in everyday commerce, in the administration of religious bodies, and even in the realm of what is normally considered private interaction, for example, communications between patient and physician.\"\" In 1999, the Dzurinda government passed Act No 184 on the \"Use of the Languages of the Minority Communities\", which reintroduced the institution of bilingual school certificates and provided that in communes with more than 20 percent of inhabitants belonging to a given minority, the minority language can be used in administration, and signposts with placenames can be bilingual. Furthermore, Article 10, prohibiting doing business and drafting contracts in any other language but Slovak, was abolished from the Act. However the act limits itself to only official contacts with the state and thus fails to overcome the 1996 act ensuring the use of Slovak in culture, schools and media. Language rights in education have also been a sphere of antagonism between the Slovak state and the Hungarian minority. Bilingual education in priamary and secondary schools is currently permitted. However, the array of subjects that should be taught in each language remained a highly contested issue. Government proposals prior to the 1998 elections (i.e. under Mečiar's government) even suggested that certain subjects should be taught only by teachers of 'Slovak origin' to ensure that the Slovak population living in areas with significant Hungarian populations should be able to assimilate themselves into mainstream Slovak life. According to Duray: \"On March 12, 1997 (i.e. under Mečiar's government), the Undersecretary of Education sent a circular to the heads of the school districts making known the following regulations: In Hungarian schools the Slovak language should be taught exclusively by native speakers. The same exclusion criteria applies to non-Slovak schools in the teaching of geography and history. (The Undersecretary modified the language of this regulation later by changing the term \"exclusively\" for \"mainly\".) In communities where the Hungarian community exceeds 40% of the total population the teachers of Slovak schools receive supplementary pay. In all communities which include a Hungarians population and where there is no school or there is no Slovak school, wherever possible a Slovak school should be opened, but not a Hungarian one.\" At the end of the 1998 school year a large number of Hungarian pupils handed back their school report that were issued only in Slovak.\n\nIn 2003, there were 295 Hungarian elementary schools and 75 secondary schools in Slovakia. In most of them Hungarian was used as the medium of instruction, excluding 35 elementary schools and 18 secondary schools, which were bilingual.\n\nAfter the parliamentary elections in 2006, the nationalist Slovak National Party (SNS) of Ján Slota became a member of the ruling coalition led by Robert Fico. In August a few incidents motivated by ethnic hatred caused diplomatic tensions between the countries. Mainstream Hungarian and Slovak media blamed Slota's anti-Hungarian statements from the early summer for worsening ethnic relations. (Further informations: 2006 Slovak-Hungarian diplomatic affairs, and Hedvig Malina).\n\nOn 27 September 2007 the Beneš decrees were reconfirmed by the Slovak parliament which legitimized the Hungarians and Germans calumniation and deportation from Czechoslovakia after World War II.\n\nIn 2008, the dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church in Slovakia were reorganized. 8 dioceses were introduced in place of the previous 6. Until the reform the area of \"Žitný ostrov\" (Hungarian: \"Csallóköz\"), the \"Matúšova zem\" (\"Mátyusföld\") and \"Poiplie\" (\"Ipolymente\") - where a big portion of the Hungarians of Slovakia resides - belonged to the Archdiocese of Bratislava-Trnava. Now it belongs to four different dioceses. This triggered the protest of Hungarian catholic worshippers and priests. However, the reform was introduced by the Vatican, not by the Slovak Republic.\n\nAlso in 2008, Ján Mikolaj (SNS), minister of education propagated changes in the Hungarian schools of Slovakia. According to a new education law plan, the Hungarian language which was educated as mother tongue until now will be considered a foreign language - and taught in a smaller proportion of lessons. The only textbooks allowed to be used in Hungarian schools will be those translated from Slovak books and approved by Slovak administration.<br>\nIn October 2008 Hungarian parents and teachers sent back Hungarian textbooks to the Minister of Education. The books contained geographical names only in Slovak violating the basic rules of the Hungarian language and the minorities' right of usage of their native language.<br>\nIn November 2008 Prime Minister Robert Fico has again promised, this time at a cabinet meeting in Komárno (Révkomárom), southern Slovakia, that an ongoing problem with textbooks for ethnic Hungarian schools in Slovakia will be resolved. Though as of November 2008 Ján Slota still insists on the grammatically incorrect version (Slovak language names in Hungarian sentences) and having the correct Hungarian name only afterwards.\n\nThe Slovak authorities denied the registration of a Hungarian traditional folk art association, because they used the Hungarian word \"Kárpát-medence\" (Carpathian Basin). According to Dušan Čaplovič the word and the association is against the sovereignty of Slovakia, furthermore the word is fascist, it is familiar with the German Lebensraum, and Hungarians use it in this ideology.\nOn September 1, 2009 more than ten thousand Hungarians held demonstrations to protest against the so-called language law that limits the use of minority languages in Slovakia. The law calls for fines of up to £4,380 for anyone \"misusing the Slovak language.\nThe particular anti-Hungarian edge of the Slovak public discourse reached its top in the 2010 parliamentary elections, when numerous parties have been campaigning with latent to openly anti-Hungarian slogans. The presently governing Smer has rented billboards that have warned that \"They have given power to SMK! They will do it again!\", alleging that forming a coalition with SMK would be dangerous. SNS went even further and published openly anti-Hungarian posters (see the picture on the right) asserting that Slovakia's on the brim of being conquered by Hungary due to the new Hungarian government's actions. Posters by SNS have been prominently featured in areas with predominantly Hungarian populace too.\n\nIn January 2011, a Hungarian sociologist László Gyurgyík expected that, by the May 2011 census, the number of Hungarian ethnicity citizens in Slovakia will be between 460,000 and 490,000. The actual figure recorded in the census was 458,467 or 8.5%, although the census data is affected by a high level of respondents (7%) not specifying their nationality.\n\nSince deputy prime minister Robert Fico declared the \"wise historism\" concept, the history books are getting rewritten at a faster pace than before, and in an increased \"spirit of national pride\", which Krekovič, Mannová and Krekovičová claim are mainly nothing else, but history falsifications. Such new inventions are the interpretation of Great Moravia as a (proto)-Slovak state, or the term \"proto-Slovak\" itself, along with the \"refreshing\" of many \"old traditions\", that in fact did not exist or were not Slovak before. The concept received criticism in Slovakia pointing out that the term proto-Slovak cannot be found in any serious publication, simply because it lacks any scientific basis. Miroslav Kusý Slovak political scientist explained that by adopting such scientifically questionable rhetoric Fico aims to \"strengthen national consciousness by falsification of history\".\n\nThe ethnic relationship of Prešov Region is complex and volatile. A long-term cultural and everyday cohabition of Rusyns, Slovaks and Hungarians, under the prepodence of the non-Rusyn element led to the linguistic Slovakization of Rusyns, while in some parts (in cities and ethnic islands in the south) they were Magyarized. Still, in both cases they preserved their religion (Greek Catholicism). Until the 1920s, the Slovak-speaking Greek-Catholics composed a transitional group that was connected with the Rusyns through religion and traditions, with Slovak as their language. Their number was gradually increasing with the transition of the parts of Rusyn population to the Slovak language. Slovakization of the Rusyn population increased in the times of the Czechoslovakian authorities (since 1920). The Greek Catholics and Orthodox started to perceive themselves as Slovaks. It is difficult to estimate the distribution of the Orthodox and the Greek Catholics by the language as well as to determine the number of Rusyns because both the Hungarian and Czechoslovakian censuses provided the incorrect number of Rusyns, but it contains roughly 50-100 000 people. According to censuses the decrease of the number of Rusyns was influenced not only by Slovakization but also by emigration of a significant number of Rusyns from Prešov, mainly to the Czech lands.\n\nThe Slovak pressure on Rusyns in Slovakia increased after 1919 when Czechoslovakia incorporated Transcarpathia to the east of the Uzh River. The Slovakization of Rusyns (and Ukrainians) was a part of the program of the Slovak People's Party, whose leader refused to cooperate with the Rusyn politicians of Transcarpathia but cooperated with Hungarian-speaking A. Brody. Therefore, the Rusyn politicians opened the links with the Czech political parties which were supportive of neutrality towards the Rusyn question. The cultural Slovak-Rusyn relations at the time were minimal.\n\nThe early Hungarian censuses ignored the Polish nationality, all ethnic Poles were registered as Slovaks. There was also a very strong process of Slovakization of Polish people throughout 18th–20th centuries, mostly done by Roman Catholic Church, in which institution the local aboriginal Polish priests were replaced with Slovak ones. Also the institution of schooling was replacing the Polish language with Slovak during classes.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56463164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56463164", "title": "Spaltklang", "text": "Spaltklang\n\nSpaltklang (literally: \"split sound\") is a term in music theory. It is defined as an extremely clear and transparent sound pattern of an instrumental piece. It stands in opposition to the music of the Classical-Romantic period which favoured the merging of the individual instrumental voices to one complex sound.\n\nExamples of applied Spaltklang can be found in New Music such as Igor Stravinsky’s Histoire du soldat. Instrumental categories are represented by the high- and low-pitched instruments; middle-toned instruments, on the other hand, are not accounted for. In the string section, for instance, only violin and double bass are represented, while viola and cello are not. This pitch gap creates a clear contrast and prevents the individual tones from merging into one sound.\n\nMoreover, the term appears in connection with multiphonics.\n\nThe term Spaltklang can also be found in the field of organ building. Here, it refers to organs that have registers with very different and distinct timbres. Therefore, single registers tend to be played in isolation. This is in contrast to organs which operate on the basis of a merged sound, which is achieved by adding registers to a root note. Spaltklang seems to be particularly associated with organs from the Renaissance period. Amongst organists, Spaltklang is furthermore used to describe the omission of a register, e.g. playing the 8‘ and 2’ registers but omitting the 4’ register.\n\n"}
{"id": "2929758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2929758", "title": "Station North Arts and Entertainment District", "text": "Station North Arts and Entertainment District\n\nThe Station North Arts and Entertainment District (often referred to as just Station North) is an area and official arts and entertainment district in the U.S. city of Baltimore, Maryland. The neighborhood is marked by a combination of artistically-leaning commercial ventures, such as theaters and museums, as well as formerly abandoned warehouses that have since been converted into loft-style living. It is roughly triangular, bounded on the north by 20th Street, on the east by Greenmount Avenue, and on the south and west by the tracks of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, though the neighborhood's boundaries include a one-block wide extension over the tracks.\n\nStation North is composed of portions of three Baltimore neighborhoods: Charles North, Greenmount West, and Barclay. In recent decades, the area represented a relatively impoverished area between the wealthier neighborhoods of Mount Vernon, Bolton Hill, and Charles Village. However, in addition to its proximity to those neighborhoods, a number of factors made the area amenable to redevelopment and gentrification. Much of even the poorest sections of the neighborhood feature beautiful, three-story, early 20th-century rowhouses as the main housing stock; the Maryland Institute College of Art is within walking distance; and Penn Station lies at the south edge of the neighborhood, providing walking-distance access to Amtrak, Light Rail and MARC commuter rail service (the latter being of particular interest to those commuting to Washington, D.C.). The real estate bubble of the 2000s caused Baltimore's housing prices to skyrocket, and drove home buyers seeking out cheaper areas on the upswing to the neighborhood.\n\nThe Baltimore city government's 2002 designation of the area as an arts district has furthered the neighborhood's transformation. The earliest and most visible signs of change were the official conversion of several industrial and warehouse buildings to mixed-use housing. The Copycat Building is probably the best known, but two other buildings—the Oliver Street Studios Building (which also houses Area 405 and the Station North Tool Library) and the Cork Factory—are also occupied. These buildings have been in use recently as artist's studios and benefitted by the area winning the State of Maryland's first Arts and Entertainment District status under then-mayor Martin O'Malley. Such designation paved the way for these buildings to be rezoned for residential use, due to the collaboration between multiple building owners in The District.\n\nThe neighborhood's commercial, residential, and artistic venues began to thrive. The commercial district on Charles Street is anchored by the Charles Theatre, a popular art house multiplex that also serves as the anchor venue for the annual Maryland Film Festival each May, as well as Scapescape (a music and arts festival) each Labor Day weekend,The Station North Arts Cafe Gallery, the Station North Arts Underground, The Metro Gallery, Tapas Teatro, Club Charles, The Yellow Sign Theater, The Strand Theater, Single Carrot Theater, and Sofi's Crepes; one block away is the Charm City Art Space which serves as a Music Venue, and Art Gallery. In recent years, the North Avenue corridor has become a hub of activity with Joe Squared Restaurant, The Wind Up Space (an arts venue and bar), Liam Flynn's Ale House, and The Chicken Box, a Station North Arts District sponsored multiuse arts space opened in mid-2013. The Chicken Box is also home to the Baltimore Annex Theater.\n\nBy 2005, the neighborhood was seeing a definite boom, but areas of blight persisted, particularly at the northern and eastern edges. As of 2010, the northern and eastern edges of Station North, particularly near Greenmount Avenue, are still affected by vacant housing, drug dealing, and prostitution. This area stands in stark contrast to the environment only a few blocks west, where in 2007 the Station North Townhomes were completed. The proximity of these luxury $300,000 townhouses to the remaining areas of urban decay illustrates both the potential and the challenges that the neighborhood faces.\n\nIn Maryland, the State Department of Business and Economic Development designates certain neighborhoods “arts and entertainment districts”, which confers three specific tax breaks. Artists who live and work in the district are offered property-tax credits on qualifying renovations, can apply for an income-tax credit when they make money on their art, and are given a waiver of the admissions and amusement tax charged by the city. Artists who live or work in Station North may qualify for certain tax breaks by submitting Form 502AE (Subtraction For Income Derived Within An Arts and Entertainment District) with their Maryland Tax Returns. Major tax benefits concerning building usage are also in place, with assessment freezes and building rehab credits to encourage growth.\n\nIt has been argued that the Arts District designation confers little benefit to the artists who worked so tirelessly to rebuild the area and change the antiquated zoning laws which were heavy industrial, to mixed use - for studios, retail and living spaces. Many of the benefits promised residents and building owners when the District was formed have never materialized and the line of direct communication with the Mayor's office, which oversaw the transformation, is just a faded memory.\n\nAlthough the city and state have developed preliminary plans to provide affordable housing and work space for local artists and residents, many argue that the area provides few actual benefits to working artists. This has fostered the sentiment that the city has been exploiting the cachet of the artists in Station North, while rarely working with them in any meaningful way.\n\nFurthermore, as the neighborhood undergoes gentrification, there is the concern that, like SoHo in Manhattan before it, local artists and entertainers will be forced out of the neighborhood if a proper balance is not struck between redevelopment and the needs of artists and lower income residents.\n\nStation North's namesake comes from its placement of being north of Penn Station, which houses Amtrak and MARC trains. The Baltimore Light Rail has two stations that are within proximity to the district; Penn Station and North Avenue. MTA Maryland bus lines 3, 8, 11, 13, 27, 36, 61, and 64 also service the area.\n\nA 2006 Action Plan Report, prepared by Randall Gross / Development Economics, the Baltimore Neighborhood Collaborative, and Station North Arts & Entertainment, Inc., focuses on four key strategies: To strengthen positive image and identity, to establish commercial corridors, to provide housing options to attract new residents while preventing displacement of existing residents, and to encourage economic development.\n\nIn early 2008, Baltimore’s development arm, the Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC), released a preview of their master plan for the area. In the near term, the master plan includes converting the top three floors of Penn Station into a botique hotel, with long-term goals including construction of high-rise residential buildings.\n\nOn October 30, 2008, Mayor Sheila Dixon unveiled the Charles North Vision Plan, a multi-phased development initiative. This plan identified four areas to focus revitalization on: Charles Gateway/Penn Station, the corner of Charles Street and North Avenue, the creation of an \"Asia Town\" at 20th Street and Charles Street, and the \"Creative/Design Zone\". The plan's ultimate goal is to transform the arts and entertainment district north of Pennsylvania Station into a $1 billion \"cultural crossroads\" for Baltimore. The plan calls for over $100 million in subsidies to aid in the development of the area.\n\nAn agreement with Hospitality Partners of Bethesda to construct the hotel in Penn Station was reached in 2009, with completion of the $9 million project scheduled for late 2010.\n\nIn early 2010, construction began on City Arts, a $15 million housing development for artists. Consisting of 69 apartments for rent and eight town houses for sale, City Arts will be the first all-new housing project in the arts district since a $1 billion \"vision plan\" was unveiled for the area in 2008. The building will consist of four stories of apartments, a multipurpose first-floor space provided for artistic use by the residents, and thirty-five off-street parking spaces. Key to the project’s plans are financing regulations that will ensure the space remains affordable to artists even as the neighborhood changes. The project was featured on CNN as an example of how federal Recovery Act money has restarted development that stalled during the economic downturn.\n\n"}

{"id": "19738253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19738253", "title": "Tradigital art", "text": "Tradigital art\n\nTradigital art is art (including animation) that combines both traditional and computer-based techniques to create an image.\n\nArtist and teacher Judith Moncrieff first coined the term. In the early 1990s, while an instructor at the Pacific Northwest College of Art, Moncrieff invented and taught a new digital medium called \"Tradigital\". The school held a competition between Moncrieff's students, who used the medium to electronically combine everything from photographs of costumes to stills from videotapes of performing dancers. Moncrieff also referred to her business entity (formerly \"Moncrieff Studios\") as \"Tradigital Imaging\" around the same period.\n\nMoncrieff was one of five founding members of the digital art collective called \"Unique Editions\". These five artists—Helen Golden, Bonny Lhotka, Dorothy Krause, Judith Moncrieff, and Karin Schminke—combined their expertise in traditional studio media and techniques with digital imaging to produce original fine art and editions. The artists met in June, 1994, at \"Beyond the Digital Print\", a workshop organized by Krause at Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston. The artists' varied backgrounds are evident in their mixed media approach to using the computer as an art-making tool. Although every image is conceived and executed at least in part on the computer, the range of work includes one of a kind paintings, collages, Polaroid and image transfers, monotypes and prints on such varied substrates as canvas, handmade paper, and embossed metal. Moncrieff used the term \"Tradigital media\" to describe this merging of traditional and digital tools and \"tradigitalism\" as a name for this emerging movement. Unique Editions also served as a research and public relations entity for exploring technologies and promoting digital art. The group forged links with hardware and software developers in an effort to provide feedback on their products from the artist's perspective. It served as a demonstration to the rest of the art world of the role of digital technologies in the artist's studio. Unique Editions became inactive in 1997; however, Golden and Moncrieff continued to work together under the name, \"Tradigital Fine Art\".\n\nIndependently in the early 1990s, artist Lisa Wray was developing the fine art style she calls \"Renaissance of Metaphysical Imagery\". Prototypes were made for each work from color copies, color photos or film negatives made in her graphic arts darkroom. In 1990, she visited the only two places in the country with proprietary computer systems capable of assembling her prototypes: Raphael Digital Transparencies in Houston Texas, and Dodge Color Laboratories in Washington D.C. The first two prototypes, Brew of Life and Fantasy, were assembled by Dodge Color Laboratories on a Superset machine that was first developed by the Department of Defense. The final art was archived on 1\" magnetic tape, and then output as an 11x14” color film transparency. Lisa discovered Judith Montcrieff and her pioneering efforts with Unique Editions and Tradigital Fine Art, in the early 1990s, found the term, \"Tradigital\", and also used the term to describe her own work.\n\nSince then, use of the term has greatly expanded to include other art forms.\n\nIn 2002, \"tradigital\" went mainstream when Jeffrey Katzenberg used the term tradigital animation to refer to the blending of computer animation with classical cell animation techniques, \"a seamless blend of two-dimensional and three-dimensional animation techniques\". He mentioned as examples such animation films as \"Toy Story\", \"Antz\", \"Shrek\", \"Ice Age\", and \"\". He believed that Walt Disney (a traditional art animator) would approve of the changes in the way cartoons are made today. Animation World Magazine describes tradigital television, and the impact of tradigital animation on pre- and post-production processes for television shows.\n\nTradigital printing is an experimental approach to printmaking with contemporary technology. In one form of tradigital printing, printmakers use computers to generate positives for UV photo transfer to plates and screens. In another form, digital print output incorporating silkscreen, relief or intaglio techniques is the focus. For example, the Josephine Press uses a process that combines the use of archival digital prints with traditional techniques such as intaglio, woodcuts, lithographs, and all of the other traditional printmaking methods. The process allows the artist to create a multi-color image without using a four-plate process. In addition to more efficient registration, the artist can work with collage and other mixed media works that can be scanned and reproduced in an archival manner. Tradigital printing greatly expands the possibilities of image-making while still producing an original hand pulled, limited edition, fine art print.\n\nA recent Wall Street Journal article hailed tradigital creatives as the \"voice of tomorrow\", contrasting them with both \"traditionalists\" and \"digitalists\", and identifying several distinguishing characteristics of the new art/marketing medium: voices not eyeballs; experience not messages; community not communication; utility and solutions not cleverness; collaborative not silo thinkers.\n\n"}
{"id": "19842905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19842905", "title": "Training and development", "text": "Training and development\n\nHuman resource management regards training and development as a function concerned with organizational activity aimed at bettering the job performance of individuals and groups in organizational settings. Training and development can be described as \"an educational process which involves the sharpening of skills, concepts, changing of attitude and gaining more knowledge to enhance the performance of employees\".\nThe field has gone by several names, including \"human resource development\", \"human capital development\" and \"learning and development\".\n\nThe name of the discipline has been debated, with the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development in 2000 arguing that \"human resource development\" is too evocative of the master-slave relationship between employer and employee for those who refer to their employees as \"partners\" or \"associates\" to feel comfortable with. Eventually, the CIPD settled upon \"learning and development\", although that was itself not free from problems, \"learning\" being an over-general and ambiguous name, and most organizations referring to it as \"training and development\".\n\nTraining and development encompasses three main activities: training, education, and development.\n\nThe \"stakeholders\" in training and development are categorized into several classes. The sponsors of training and development are senior managers. The clients of training and development are business planners. Line managers are responsible for coaching, resources, and performance. The participants are those who actually undergo the processes. The facilitators are Human Resource Management staff. And the providers are specialists in the field. Each of these groups has its own agenda and motivations, which sometimes conflict with the agendas and motivations of the others.\n\nThe conflicts that are the best part of career consequences are those that take place between employees and their bosses. The number one reason people leave their jobs is conflict with their bosses. And yet, as author, workplace relationship authority, and executive coach, Dr. John Hoover points out, \"Tempting as it is, nobody ever enhanced his or her career by making the boss look stupid.\" Training an employee to get along well with authority and with people who entertain diverse points of view is one of the best guarantees of long-term success. Talent, knowledge, and skill alone won't compensate for a sour relationship with a superior, peer, or customer.\n\nMany training and development approaches available for organisations are proposed including: on-the-job training, mentoring, apprenticeship, simulation, web-based learning, instructor-led classroom training, programmed self-instruction, case studies/role playing, systematic job rotations and transfers .etc.\n\nTypical roles in the field include executive and supervisory/management development, new-employee orientation, professional-skills training, technical/job training, customer-service training, sales-and-marketing training, and health-and-safety training. Job titles may include vice-president of organizational effectiveness, training manager or director, management development specialist, blended-learning designer, training-needs analyst, chief learning officer, and individual career-development advisor.\n\nTalent development is the process of changing an organization, its employees, its stakeholders, and groups of people within it, using planned and unplanned learning, in order to achieve and maintain a competitive advantage for the organization. Rothwell notes that the name may well be a term in search of a meaning, like so much in management, and suggests that it be thought of as selective attention paid to the top 10% of employees, either by potential or performance.\n\nWhile talent development is reserved for the top management it is becoming increasingly clear that career development is necessary for the retention of any employee, no matter what their level in the company. Research has shown that some type of career path is necessary for job satisfaction and hence job retention. Perhaps organizations need to include this area in their overview of employee satisfaction.\n\nThe term talent development is becoming increasingly popular in several organizations, as companies are now moving from the traditional term training and development. Talent development encompasses a variety of components such as training, career development, career management, and organizational development, and training and development. It is expected that during the 21st century more companies will begin to use more integrated terms such as talent development.\n\nTraining is crucial for organizational development and its success which is indeed fruitful to both employers and employees of an organization. Here are some important benefits of training and development\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18579491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18579491", "title": "Travelling exhibition", "text": "Travelling exhibition\n\nA travelling exhibition, also referred to as a \"travelling exhibit\" or a \"touring exhibition\", is a type of exhibition that is presented at more than one venue.\n\nTemporary exhibitions can bring together objects that might be dispersed among several collections, to reconstruct an original context such as an artist’s career or a patron's collection, or to propose connections - perhaps the result of recent research - which give new insights or a different way of understanding items in museum collections. The whole exhibition, usually with associated services, including insurance, shipping, storage, conservation, mounting, set up, etc., can then be loaned to one or more venues to lengthen the life of the exhibition and to allow the widest possible audiences - regionally, nationally or internationally - to experience these objects and the stories they contain. Such collaborations can add interest to museums where displays of permanent collections might change only slowly, helping to provide fresh interpretations or more complete stories and attract new audiences. They also provide fresh ideas and breathing space for organisations which have exhibition spaces but lack permanent collections.\n\nTo have more than one location for the same exhibition can benefit the organiser because it can then share a part of the production costs among the venues, so museums and galleries frequently use touring as a cost-efficient way of promoting access to their collections. For organisers and their venues, touring exhibitions are important for sharing ideas (for example, promoting techniques for providing for visitors with visual impairments or producing displays which examine current or topical issues) and materials (especially objects that might not be seen in public frequently or even shown together), as well as resources (human as well as financial). Touring is a way of sharing with like-minded institutions and of achieving economies of scale which allow more ambitious projects to happen.\n\nTravelling exhibitions are often supported by governmental organizations to promote access to knowledge and materials that might not be available locally. To acknowledge the importance of travelling exhibitions, in 1983 the International Council of Museums (ICOM) established the International Committee for Exhibition Exchange (ICEE) as a forum to discuss the different aspects of exhibition development, circulation and exchange. \n\n\n"}
