It also contains many sources on carillon art in general.\n\nThe library was created in 1968 following the death of Anton Brees, the first carillonneur at the Singing Tower. It is named in his honor. A Carillon is a musical instrument consisting of at least 23 tuned bells in chromatic series, played from a keyboard. A carillonneur is the individual that plays this instrument. The Bok Tower was created in 1929, along with magnificent gardens and its unique Singing Tower Carillon. Edward W. Bok was the Founder of the Bok Tower and its gardens, which was originally intended as a bird sanctuary. The Anton Brees Library was created later and for a number of reasons no individuals are allowed inside the library. Historical materials from the library are available through an online catalog and digital collections. In-person access to the collections is available by appointment only . \n\nThe Anton Brees Carillon Library is located on the fifth level of the Singing Tower. It is one of the largest collections of carillon-related materials in the world.\n\nWhile a relatively small collection with approximately 1,500 books of carillon and related literature, it is the scope of its holdings and ephemera that makes the library unique. In addition to these books, the library also house 900 volumes of trade journals devoted to various aspects of carillon art and related industries. Most important, though, is its collection of over 3,000 musical scores written for the carillon. The library also has 3,000 audio and video recordings and, musical scores for keyboard instruments, and various documents relating to carillon concerts and biographies. Finally, the library includes information on North American and foreign carillons, individuals, and bell foundries. \n\nThe library is home to five separate collections. These collections are the ABCL vertical files, Guild of Carillonneurs in North America Archives, Ronald Barnes Collection, Anton Brees Collection, Sidney Giles Collection, and the Arthur Bigelow Collection. \n"}

A trained clinical psychologist, Nandy has provided theoretical critiques of European colonialism, development, modernity, secularism, Hindutva, science, technology, nuclearism, cosmopolitanism, and utopia. He has also offered alternative conceptions relating to cosmopolitanism and critical traditionalism. In addition to the above, Nandy has offered an original historical profile of India's commercial cinema as well as critiques of state and violence.\n\nHe was Senior Fellow and Former Director of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) for several years. Today, he is a Senior Honorary Fellow at the institute and apart from being the Chairperson of the Committee for Cultural Choices and Global Futures, also in New Delhi.\n\nNandy had received the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize in 2007. In 2008 he appeared on the list of the Top 100 Public Intellectuals Poll of the Foreign Policy magazine, published by The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nNandy was born in a Bengali Christian family at Bhagalpur, Bihar, in 1937. He is the eldest of three sons of Satish Chandra Nandy and Prafulla Nalini Nandy, and brother of Pritish Nandy. Later, his family moved to Calcutta. Nandy's mother was a teacher at La Martiniere School, Calcutta and subsequently became the school's first Indian vice principal. When he was 10, British India was partitioned into two sovereign countries – India and Pakistan. He witnessed the time of conflicts and atrocities that followed.\n\nNandy quit medical college before joining Hislop College, Nagpur to study social sciences. Later he took a master's degree in sociology. However, his academic interest tended increasingly towards clinical psychology and he did his PhD in psychology at Dept. of Psychology, Gujarat University, Ahmedabad.\n\nWhile a professed non-believer, Nandy identifies with the Bengali Christian community.\n\nNandy joined the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), Delhi, as a young faculty member. While working there, he developed his own methodology by integrating clinical psychology and sociology. Meanwhile, he was invited by a number of universities and research institutions abroad to carry out research and to give them lectures. He served as the Director of CSDS between 1992 and 1997. He also serves on the Editorial Collective of Public Culture, a reviewed journal published by Duke University Press.\n\nNandy has coauthored a number of human rights reports and is active in movements for peace, alternative sciences and technologies, and cultural survival. He is a member of the Executive Councils of the World Futures Studies Federation, the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, the International Network for Cultural Alternatives to Development, and the People's Union for Civil Liberties. Nandy has been a Woodrow Wilson Fellow at the Wilson Center, Washington, D.C., a Charles Wallace Fellow at the University of Hull, and a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Humanities, University of Edinburgh. He held the first UNESCO Chair at the Center for European Studies, University of Trier, in 1994. In 2006 he became the National Fellow of the Indian Council of Social Science Research.\n\nProfessor Nandy is an intellectual who identifies and explores numerous and diverse problems. He has written extensively in last two decades. His 1983 book, titled \"The Intimate Enemy: Loss and Recovery of Self Under Colonialism\", talked about the psychological problems posed at a personal level by colonialism, for both coloniser and colonised. Nandy argues that the understanding of self is intertwined with those of race, class, and religion under colonialism, and that the Gandhian movement can be understood in part as an attempt to transcend a strong tendency of educated Indians to articulate political striving for independence in European terms. Through his prolific writing and other activities supported by his belief in non-violence, Professor Nandy has offered penetrating analysis from different angles of a wide range of problems such as political disputes and racial conflicts, and has made suggestions about how human beings can exist together, and together globally, irrespective of national boundaries.\n\nBooks\n\nSelected articles\n\nSelected essays\n\n\nDuring the Jaipur Literature Festival held in January 2013, Nandy participated in a panel where he was quoted to have made controversial statements on corruption among \"lower\" castes in India. It was reported that he said,\n\nRajasthan Police lodged an FIR under the SC/ST Act against Ashis Nandy for his statement regarding corruption among the SC/ST and OBCs. After Nandy's lawyer moved the Supreme Court to quash all the allegations against him, the Court issued a stay order on his arrest on 1 February 2013. The subaltern scholar Dr. Satyanarayana has challenged Nandy's remarks and expressed shock at the vociferous support he received for this from the Indian media and academia, asking rhetorically, \"Is Prof. Nandy a holy cow?\".\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41938", "title": "Bloomsbury Group", "text": "Bloomsbury Group\n\nThe Bloomsbury Group—or Bloomsbury Set—was a group of associated English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists in the first half of the 20th century, including Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes, E. M. Forster and Lytton Strachey. This loose collective of friends and relatives was closely associated with Cambridge University for the men and King's College London for the women, and they lived, worked or studied together near Bloomsbury, London. According to Ian Ousby, \"although its members denied being a group in any formal sense, they were united by an abiding belief in the importance of the arts.\" Their works and outlook deeply influenced literature, aesthetics, criticism, and economics as well as modern attitudes towards feminism, pacifism, and sexuality.\n\nAll male members of the Bloomsbury Group, except Duncan Grant, were educated at Cambridge (either at Trinity or King’s College). Most of them, except Clive Bell and the Stephen brothers, were members of \"the exclusive Cambridge society, the 'Apostles'\". At Trinity in 1899 Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf, Saxon Sydney-Turner and Clive Bell became good friends with Thoby Stephen, and it was through Thoby and Adrian Stephen's sisters Vanessa and Virginia that the men met the women of Bloomsbury when they came down to London.\n\nIn 1905 Vanessa began the \"Friday Club\" and Thoby ran \"Thursday Evenings\", which became the basis for the Bloomsbury Group, which to some was really \"Cambridge in London\". Thoby's premature death in 1906 brought them more firmly together and they became what is now known as the \"Old Bloomsbury\" group who met in earnest beginning in 1912. In the 1920s and 1930s the group shifted when the original members died and the next generation had reached adulthood.\n\nThe Bloomsbury Group, mostly from upper middle-class professional families, formed part of \"an intellectual aristocracy which could trace itself back to the Clapham Sect\". It was an informal network of an influential group of artists, art critics, writers and an economist, many of whom lived in the West Central 1 district of London known as Bloomsbury. They were \"spiritually\" similar to the Clapham group who supported its members' careers: \"The Bloomsberries promoted one another's work and careers just as the original Claphamites did, as well as the intervening generations of their grandparents and parents.\"\n\nA historical feature of these friends and relations is that their close relationships all pre-dated their fame as writers, artists, and thinkers.\n\nThe group had ten core members:\n\nIn addition to these ten, Leonard Woolf, in the 1960s, listed as 'Old Bloomsbury' Adrian and Karin Stephen, Saxon Sydney-Turner, and Molly MacCarthy, with Julian Bell, Quentin Bell and Angelica Bell, and David Garnett as later additions\". Except for Forster, who published three novels before the highly successful \"Howards End\" in 1910, the group were late developers.\n\nThere were stable marriages and varied and complicated affairs among the individual members. Lytton Strachey and his cousin and lover Duncan Grant became close friends of the Stephen sisters, Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf. Duncan Grant had affairs with siblings Vanessa Bell and Adrian Stephen, as well as David Garnett, Maynard Keynes, and James Strachey. Clive Bell married Vanessa in 1907, and Leonard Woolf returned from the Ceylon Civil Service to marry Virginia in 1912. Cambridge Apostle friendships brought into the group Desmond MacCarthy, his wife Molly, and E. M. Forster.\n\nThe group met not only in their homes in Bloomsbury, central London, but also at countryside retreats. There are two significant ones near Lewes in Sussex: Charleston Farmhouse, where Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant moved in 1916, and Monk's House (now owned by the National Trust), in Rodmell, owned by Virginia and Leonard Woolf from 1919.\n\nMuch about Bloomsbury appears to be controversial, including its membership and name: indeed, some would maintain that \"the three words 'the Bloomsbury group' have been so much used as to have become almost unusable\".\n\nClose friends, brothers, sisters, and even sometimes partners of the friends were not necessarily members of Bloomsbury: Keynes’s wife Lydia Lopokova was only reluctantly accepted into the group, and there were certainly \"writers who were at some time close friends of Virginia Woolf, but who were distinctly not 'Bloomsbury': T. S. Eliot, Katherine Mansfield, Hugh Walpole\". Another is Vita Sackville-West, who became \"Hogarth Press's best-selling author\". Members cited in \"other lists might include Ottoline Morrell, or Dora Carrington, or James and Alix Strachey\".\n\nThe lives and works of the group members show an overlapping, interconnected similarity of ideas and attitudes that helped to keep the friends and relatives together, reflecting in large part the influence of G. E. Moore: \"the essence of what Bloomsbury drew from Moore is contained in his statement that 'one's prime objects in life were love, the creation and enjoyment of aesthetic experience and the pursuit of knowledge'\".\n\nThrough the Apostles they also encountered the analytic philosophers G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell who were revolutionizing British philosophy at the start of the 20th century. Distinguishing between ends and means was a commonplace of ethics, but what made Moore's \"Principia Ethica\" (1903) so important for the philosophical basis of Bloomsbury thought was Moore's conception of \"intrinsic worth\" as distinct from \"instrumental value\". As with the distinction between love (an intrinsic state) and monogamy (a behavior), Moore's differentiation between intrinsic and instrumental value allowed the Bloomsburies to maintain an ethical high-ground based on intrinsic merit, independent of, and without reference to, the consequences of their actions. For Moore, intrinsic value depended on an indeterminable intuition of good and a concept of complex states of mind whose worth as a whole was not proportionate to the sum of its parts. For both Moore and Bloomsbury, the greatest ethic goods were \"the importance of personal relationships and the private life\", as well as aesthetic appreciation: \"art for art's sake\".\n\nBloomsbury reacted against current social rituals, \"the bourgeois habits ... the conventions of Victorian life\" with their emphasis on public achievement, in favour of a more informal and private focus on personal relationships and individual pleasure. E. M. Forster for example approved of \"the decay of smartness and fashion as factors, and the growth of the idea of enjoyment\", and asserted that \"if I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country\".\n\nThe Group \"believed in pleasure ... They tried to get the maximum of pleasure out of their personal relations. If this meant triangles or more complicated geometric figures, well then, one accepted that too\". Yet at the same time, they shared a sophisticated, civilized, and highly articulated ideal of pleasure. As Virginia Woolf put it, their \"triumph is in having worked out a view of life which was not by any means corrupt or sinister or merely intellectual; rather ascetic and austere indeed; which still holds, and keeps them dining together, and staying together, after 20 years\".\n\nPolitically, Bloomsbury held mainly left-liberal stances (opposed to militarism, for example); but its \"clubs and meetings were not activist, like the political organisations to which many of Bloomsbury's members also belonged\", and they would be criticised for that by their 1930s successors, who by contrast were \"heavily touched by the politics which Bloomsbury had rejected\".\n\nThe campaign for women’s suffrage added to the controversial nature of Bloomsbury, as Virginia Woolf represented the group in the fictional \"The Years\" and \"Night and Day\" works about the suffrage movement.\n\nRoger Fry joined the group in 1910. His post-impressionist exhibitions of 1910 and 1912 involved Bloomsbury in a second revolution following on the Cambridge philosophical one. This time the Bloomsbury painters were much involved and influenced. Fry and other Bloomsbury artists rejected the traditional distinction between fine and decorative art.\n\nThese \"Bloomsbury assumptions\" are reflected in members' criticisms of materialistic realism in painting and fiction, influenced above all by Clive Bell's \"concept of 'Significant Form', which separated and elevated the concept of form above content in works of art\": it has been suggested that, with their \"focus on form ...Bell's ideas have come to stand in for, perhaps too much so, the aesthetic principles of the Bloomsbury Group\".\n\nThe establishment's hostility to post-impressionism made Bloomsbury controversial, and controversial they have remained. Clive Bell polemicized post-impressionism in his widely read book \"Art\" (1914), basing his aesthetics partly on Roger Fry’s art criticism and G. E. Moore's moral philosophy; and as the war came he argued that \"in these days of storm and darkness, it seemed right that at the shrine of civilization - in Bloomsbury, I mean - the lamp should be tended assiduously\".\n\nOld Bloomsbury’s development was inevitably impacted on, along with just about everything else in modernist culture, by the First World War: indeed, \"the small world of Bloomsbury was later said by some on its outskirts to have been irretrievably shattered\", though in fact its friendships \"survived the upheavals and dislocations of war, in many ways were even strengthened by them\". Most but not all of them were conscientious objectors, which of course added to the group’s controversies. Politically the members of Bloomsbury had liberalism and socialism leanings.\n\nThough the war dispersed Old Bloomsbury, the individuals continued to develop their careers. E. M. Forster followed his successful novels with \"Maurice\" which he could not publish because it treated homosexuality untragically. In 1915 Virginia Woolf brought out her first novel, \"The Voyage Out\". And in 1917 the Woolfs founded their Hogarth Press, which would publish T. S. Eliot, Katherine Mansfield, and many others including Virginia herself along with the standard English translations of Freud. Then in 1918 Lytton Strachey published his critique of Victorianism in the shape of four ironic biographies in \"Eminent Victorians,\" which added to the arguments about Bloomsbury that continue to this day, and \"brought him the triumph he had always longed for ... The book was a sensation\".\n\nThe following year came J. M. Keynes’s influential attack on the Versailles Peace Treaty: \"The Economic Consequences of the Peace\" immediately established Maynard as an economist of international eminence\".\n\nThe 1920s were in a number of ways the blooming of Bloomsbury. Virginia Woolf was writing and publishing her most widely read modernist novels and essays, E. M. Forster completed \"A Passage to India\", a highly regarded novel on British imperialism in India. Forster wrote no more novels but he became one of England’s most influential essayists. Duncan Grant, and then Vanessa Bell, had single-artist exhibitions. Lytton Strachey wrote his biographies of two queens, Victoria then Elizabeth (and Essex). Desmond MacCarthy and Leonard Woolf engaged in friendly rivalry as literary editors, respectively of the \"New Statesman\" and \"The Nation and Athenaeum\", thus fuelling animosities that saw Bloomsbury dominating the cultural scene. Roger Fry wrote and lectured widely on art; meanwhile, Clive Bell applied Bloomsbury values to his book \"Civilization\" (1928), which Leonard Woolf saw as limited and elitist, describing Clive as a \"wonderful organiser of intellectual greyhound racing tracks\".\n\nIn the darkening 1930s, Bloomsbury began to die: \"Bloomsbury itself was hardly any longer a focus\". A year after publishing a collection of brief lives, \"Portraits in Miniature\" (1931), Lytton Strachey died; shortly afterwards Carrington shot herself. Roger Fry, who had become England’s greatest art critic, died in 1934. Vanessa and Clive's eldest son, Julian Bell, was killed in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Virginia Woolf wrote , but with the coming of war again her mental instability recurred, and she drowned herself in 1941. In the previous decade she had become one of the century's most famous feminist writers with three more novels, and a series of essays including the moving late memoir \"A Sketch of the Past\". It was also in the 1930s that Desmond MacCarthy became perhaps the most widely read—and heard—literary critic with his columns in \"The Sunday Times\" and his broadcasts with the BBC. John Maynard Keynes's \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money\" (1936) made him one of the century's most influential economists. He died in 1946 after being much involved in monetary negotiations with the United States.\n\nThe diversity yet collectivity of Later Bloomsbury's ideas and achievements can be summed up in a series of credos that were done in 1938, the year of the Munich Agreement. Virginia Woolf published her radical feminist polemic \"Three Guineas\" that shocked some of her fellow members, including Keynes who had enjoyed the gentler \"A Room of One's Own\" (1929). Keynes read his famous but decidedly more conservative memoir \"My Early Beliefs\" to The Memoir Club. Clive Bell published an appeasement pamphlet (he later supported the war), and E. M. Forster wrote an early version of his famous essay \"What I Believe\" with its choice, still shocking for some, of personal relations over patriotism: his quiet assertion in the face of the increasingly totalitarian claims of both left and right that \"personal relations ... love and loyalty to an individual can run counter to the claims of the State\".\n\nIn March 1920 Molly MacCarthy began the Memoir Club to help Desmond and herself write their memoirs; and also \"for their friends to regroup after the war (with the proviso that they should always tell the truth)\". It met until 1956 or 1964.\n\nIf \"the contempt or suspicion—the environment that a person or group creates around itself—is always a kind of alter ego, an essential and revealing part of the production\", there is perhaps much to be learnt from the (extensive) criticism that the Bloomsbury Group aroused. Early complaints focused on a perceived cliquiness: \"on personal mannerisms—the favourite phrases ('ex-quisitely civilized', and 'How \"simply too\" extraordinary!'), the incredulous, weirdly emphasised Strachey voice\". After World War I, as the members of the Group \"began to be famous, the execration increased, and the caricature of an idle, snobbish and self-congratulatory rentier class, promoting its own brand of high culture began to take shape\": as Forster self-mockingly put it, \"In came the nice fat dividends, up rose the lofty thoughts\".\n\nThe growing threats of the 1930s brought new criticism from younger writers of \"what the last lot had done (Bloomsbury, Modernism, Eliot) in favour of what they thought of as urgent hard-hitting realism\"; while \"Wyndham Lewis's \"The Apes of God\", which called Bloomsbury élitist, corrupt and talentless, caused a stir\" of its own. The most telling criticism, however, came perhaps from within the Group's own ranks, when on the eve of war Keynes gave a \"nostalgic and disillusioned account of the pure sweet air of G. E. Moore, that belief in undisturbed individualism, that Utopianism based on a belief in human reasonableness and decency, that refusal to accept the idea of civilisation as 'a thin and precarious crust' ... Keynes's fond, elegiac repudiation of his \"early beliefs\", in the light of current affairs (\"We completely misunderstood human nature, including our own\")\".\n\nIn his book on the background of the Cambridge spies Andrew Sinclair wrote about the Bloomsbury group \"rarely in the field of human endeavour has so much been written about so few who achieved so little\". American philosopher Martha Nussbaum was quoted in 1999 as saying \"I don't like anything that sets itself up as an in-group or an elite, whether it is the Bloomsbury group or Derrida\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23638717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23638717", "title": "Bouri Formation", "text": "Bouri Formation\n\nThe Bouri Formation is a sequence of sedimentary deposits that is the source of australopithecine and Homo (that is, hominin) fossils, artifacts, and bones of large mammals with cut marks from butchery with tools by early hominins. It is located in the Middle Awash Valley, in Ethiopia, East Africa, and is a part of the Afar Depression that has provided rich human fossil sites such as Gona and Hadar.\n\nThe Bouri Formation stretches down much of the length and breadth of the Bouri \"peninsula\", which projects across the dry bed of the Afar Depression. The Formation is sufficiently eroded to expose three geological members or layers: the Hatayae, the Dakanihylo, and the Herto. Human remains with signs of having been prepared for burial have been found in the Upper Herto layers.\n\nThe Bouri \"peninsula\" is a geological fault-raised horst that diverts the Awash River, forming a partial dam and creating Lake Yardi; and it contains the Bouri Formation. The peninsula is about 4 km wide by 10 km long, and lies in a NNW-SSE direction in the Quaternary-period rift zone in the southern part of the Afar Depression (Afar Triangle).\n\nThe Bouri Formation is a sediment area some 80 m thick that stretches down much of the length and breath of the peninsula. The formation consists of three geological units, called members, from which fossils and artifacts of different periods of human evolution have been excavated. They are: the lowest member, named Hatayae, or the Hata, dated to 2.5 millions of years ago (mya)—and in which fossils of \"Australopithecus garhi\" were found; the Dakanihylo, or Daka, member, one (1) mya—fossils of Homo erectus were found; and the Herto member, Lower layer at 260 kya, and Upper layers at 160 to 154 kya—fossils of Homo sapiens idaltu were found.\n\nThe area is important because active tectonics in the Afar Depression created varying habitats for early hominins across the most recent few million years known informally as the Plio-Pleistocene. These habitats, laid down in sedimentary rocks, have since been uplifted, which allowed their erosion over time and their accessibility today to paleoanthropologists. Volcanic eruptions have left volcanic tuff layers that enable accurate dating of the sedimentary deposits via Argon–argon dating.\n\nThe Hatayae layer is 40 m thick at its base and is composed of variegated silt clay and paleosols, zeolitic and bentonitic tuffs, carbonates that are pedogenic, sandstone with bivalve and gastropod shells, and mudstone. It was deposited in a floodplain alongside river delta channels and a shallow fluctuating lake dated to around 2.5 mya.\n\nIn the Hatayae member have been found the remains of \"Australopithecus garhi\", the most complete specimen of which is BOU-VP-12/130. According to Asfaw and White, et al. (1999), that species is \"..descended from \"Australopithecus afarensis\" and is a candidate ancestor for early Homo.\"\n\nExcavations in general have failed to disclose large numbers of stone tools. The likely explanation is the lack of raw materials on lake margins, which, in turn, is likely due to the lack of streams strong enough to carry hand-sized pebbles and the absence of nearby outcrops of basalt.\n\nIn spite of rarity, some isolated and widely scattered cores and flakes of Mode I technology have been found. The excavators (de Heinzelin, et al., 2002) report: \"..our surveys and excavations have demonstrated that early hominids [hominins] were actively using stone tools on the Pliocene-Hata landscape\"; and: \"It is not currently possible to positively identify the creators of the earliest stone tools here or at Gona, even though \"A. garhi\" is currently the only recognized hominid [hominin] taxon recovered from Hata sediments.\"\n\nExistence of stone tools is also evidenced by bones of large mammals—such as alcelaphinae (Wildebeest related bovids) and Hipparion, an extinct genus of three-toed horse—that show butchery cut marks by hominins including those made in removing an animal’s tongue. \"These are the earliest documented percussion marks made by hominids [hominins], who were presumably processing these bones for contained fatty marrow\"; and, \"These are the earliest documented cut marks made by hominids [hominins].\" As concluded by the excavators, the evidence from the site shows \"..a major function of the earliest known tools was meat and marrow processing of large carcasses.\" This pattern of butchery processing of large prey was maintained by hominins well into the Pliocene.\n\nThe Dakanihylo (Daka) layer is 22 to 45 m thick and composed of pumice sandstone that is cross-bedded; it is situated in the southern half of the Bouri horst and dated to 1 mya. Fossils found in the layer suggest open grassland—some 377 species of bovids (including three new species and two new genera); and water-margin habitats—species of Kobus antelope and abundant Hippopotamus.\nEarly Acheulean stone tools such as hand axes and cleavers have also been found in the Daka member, as well as evidence of butchery processing on equid, bovid and hippo bones.\n\n\"Homo erectus\" fossils include the specimen BOU-VP-2/66, or the Daka skull, an incomplete skull that had an endocranial capacity of 995 cm. These fossils (of \"H. erectus\") are important to the current debate as to whether Asian and African \"H. erectus\" were actually different human species. Asfaw, et al. (2002) reports: 1) that these fossils do not support \"..the hypothesis of a deep cladogenesis between African and Asian \"H. erectus\" ...\"; and 2) \"..that geographic subdivision of early \"H. erectus\" into separate species lineages is biologically misleading, artificially inflating early Pleistocene species diversity.\" Further, they suggest that \"..by 1 Myr the taxon had colonized much of the Old World without speciating. A finding of considerable biogeographic and behavioural significance\".\n\nThe Herto layers consist of a 15–20 m thick main sequence found in the southwestern part of the Bouri peninsula. The division between the Lower and Upper Herto layers is characterized by an erosion surface filled with rounded pebbles.\n\nThis layer presents lignite, veins of pink carbonate, and silty clays (of predominantly lake origin) containing gastropod and bivalve fossils; it is dated to 260 thousands of years ago (kya). Late Acheulean tools are found associated with hominin remains as yet unclassified. Humans in this habitat lived next to a freshwater lake and killed large mammals such as hippopotamids.\n\nThe Upper Herto member changes to yellow sandstone (from the fluvial and lake-margin deposits of the lower layer), and dates to between 160 and 154 kya. Immediately above the erosion surface separating the two layers is a sequence of volcanic sandstone and gravel deposits of variable thicknesses. It shows cross-bedded sedimentation containing pumice rocks and has produced all the human fossils and tools found in the Upper layer. The Upper layer is topped by a volcanic tuff. Two volcanic layers of very fine ash occur, one just below the hominin fossils and one just above; this important feature allows accurate argon–argon dating of adjacent sedimentary layers and their fossils, as reported above. This is valuable \"..because the accurate dating of faunas and artefacts of many sites of this general antiquity in Pleistocene Africa has proved notoriously difficult.\"\n\nIn this layer have been found early Middle Stone Age (MSA) tools and the remains of Homo sapiens idaltu. Most of the tools are scrapers, cleavers, and various lithic cores; but hand axes, picks and blades are rare. Most stone tools are made of fine-grained basalt except for points and blades made from obsidian. Many are made with the Levallois technique; these are comparable to those found in the Garba III layer at Melka Kunture. As at Herto, Garba III includes terminal Acheulean hand axes, typical Levalloisian method, and many retouched tools on flakes (side-scrapers and end-scrapers, backed knives, burins, unifacial and bifacial points). The Garba III assemblage has been considered transitional between the Acheulean and the MSA.\n\nIn this layer are found a large number of Hippopotamus bones: \"One occurrence shows abundant remains of several hippo calves, mostly newborn to a few weeks old, scattered together with butchered adults\".\n\nOf 15 of the 24 recovered fragments of humans in the Upper Herto layer have cut marks due to soft tissue removal. Clark, et al., (2003) reports that \"The latter pattern of bone surface modification is almost never present in hominid [hominin] or nonhuman faunal remains processed for consumption, and is therefore unlikely to represent evidence of utilitarian or economic behaviour.\" On one skull, \"..this defleshing manipulation must have occurred after removal of the mandible. The intentional and deliberate removal of soft tissues such as basicranial vessels, nerves and muscles is therefore indicated. The specimen lacks the entire occipital region surrounding the foramen magnum, and the edges of this broken region are smooth and polished, as are the specimen’s unweathered parietal surfaces.\"\n\nEthnographic study upon modern cultures suggests that such post-mortem manipulation could be due to \"..curation of human remains as part of mortuary practices\".\n\n"}

The film spawned two sequels, \"Bunnyman 2\" (Bunnyman Massacre) released in 2014, and \"Bunnyman Vengeance\" which was released on October 20th 2017 on VOD, and November 21st on Blu-ray and DVD.\n\nAfter showing 8 mm footage of a handcuffed woman being stabbed to death, the film switches to six friends who are driving through a desolate area when they find themselves being harassed by a truck driven man in a rabbit costume who refuses to communicate with, or show himself to, the travellers. He forces them to pull over and parks behind them. After an indeterminate length of time the costumed man drives away and kills a woman he was holding captive by ripping her in half with chains attached to his truck.\n\nEventually, the Bunnyman returns and causes the group's car to crash, killing Jack a short while later when he rams the vehicle from behind as Jack is working underneath it. The remaining five proceed to travel on foot, encountering a deranged hillbilly, a woman called Melissa and a man who advises them to seek shelter in a supposedly abandoned cabin nearby, saying they will return for them after a trip to the hospital. In reality, the two are disposing of the bodies of some of the Bunnyman's victims. En route to the cabin, two of the quintet spot the Bunnyman butchering bodies and he kills one of them with a chainsaw.\n\nChased to the cabin which belongs to the Bunnyman, the group loses two more members when Mike is killed with a chainsaw, and Tiffany is captured and tortured to death by the Bunnyman and his demented, hunchbacked accomplice, Pops. After the Bunnyman dismembers Tiffany's body and sits down to eat her flesh with Pops and Melissa, the remaining two travellers, Rachel and John, are captured while trying to get Melissa's car keys. As Melissa prepares to murder a bound Rachel, John manages to free himself from his restraints, kills Melissa and takes her keys and car.\n\nAs John and Rachel flee they are chased by the Bunnyman's truck. Concocting a plan the two pull over and John exits the vehicle carrying an unmoving Rachel who he offers to the Bunnyman. The Bunnyman hesitantly takes Rachel and places her in the cab of his truck, where she springs to life and stabs him in the neck with a pair of scissors, wounding him, and she kicks him out onto the road and driving away after John gets into the truck. As Rachel laments \"We're going to need a lot of therapy\" the wounded Bunnyman is shown walking off into the sunset. The credits then roll, alongside more 8mm footage depicting what appears to be the young Bunnyman and his family.\n\n\nA score of one out of five was awarded by Vegan Voorhees, which described the film as \"idiotic\" and concluded the review with, \"Despite director/writer/producer/actor Lindbergh's impressive enough camera work and production polish, everything that happens in \"Bunnyman\" happens wrong. Like a bitter, out of date Easter egg, it's shiny and pretty on the outside and sickening under the foil\". 28 Days Later Analysis called \"Bunnyman\" an incompetent and frustrating mess, gave it a \"generous\" three out of ten, and wrote \"atrocious acting, zero character development, no tension, zero sense of pacing, poorly written, continuity errors abound, audio problems, ADR and dubbing, poorly written characters, forced tension, meandering story, etc.\" Gorepress also gave an overwhelmingly negative critique, stating \"\"The Bunnyman Massacre\" is literally the worst film I've seen in years. Decades, even. Why? Well – simply put – because it's appallingly made on every single level\". \n"}
{"id": "338207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=338207", "title": "Burmese language", "text": "Burmese language\n\nThe Burmese language (, MLCTS: \"mranmabhasa\", IPA: ) is the Sino-Tibetan language spoken in Myanmar where it is an official language and the language of the Bamar people, the country's principal ethnic group. Although the Constitution of Myanmar officially recognizes the English name of the language as the Myanmar language, most English speakers continue to refer to the language as \"Burmese\", after \"Burma\", the older name for Myanmar. In 2007, it was spoken as a first language by 33 million, primarily the Bamar (Burman) people and related ethnic groups, and as a second language by 10 million, particularly ethnic minorities in Myanmar and neighboring countries.\n\nBurmese is a tonal, pitch-register, and syllable-timed language, largely monosyllabic and analytic, with a subject–object–verb word order. It is a member of the Lolo-Burmese grouping of the Sino-Tibetan language family. The Burmese alphabet is ultimately descended from a Brahmic script, either Kadamba or Pallava.\n\nBurmese belongs to the Southern Burmish branch of the Sino-Tibetan languages. Burmese is the most widely spoken of the non-Sinitic Sino-Tibetan languages. Burmese was the fifth of the Sino-Tibetan languages to develop a writing system, after Chinese characters, the Pyu script, the Tibetan alphabet and the Tangut script.\n\nThe majority of Burmese speakers, who live throughout the Irrawaddy River Valley, use a number of largely similar dialects, while a minority speak non-standard dialects found in the peripheral areas of the country. These dialects include:\n\nArakanese (Rakhine) in Rakhine State and Marma in Bangladesh are also sometimes considered dialects of Burmese and sometimes as separate languages.\n\nDespite vocabulary and pronunciation differences, there is mutual intelligibility among Burmese dialects, as for the most part, they share the same four tones, consonant clusters and the use of the Burmese script. However, several dialects substantially differ in Burmese with respect to vocabulary, lexical particles, and rhymes.\n\nThe standard dialect of Burmese (the Mandalay-Yangon dialect continuum) comes from the Irrawaddy River valley. Regional differences between speakers from Upper Burma (e.g., Mandalay dialect), called \"anya tha\" , and speakers from Lower Burma (e.g., Yangon dialect), called \"auk tha\" , occur in vocabulary choice, not in pronunciation. Minor pronunciation differences do exist within the Irrawaddy River valley. For instance, for the term \"food offering [to a monk]\", Lower Burmese speakers use instead of , which is the pronunciation used in Upper Burma.\n\nThe standard dialect is represented by the Yangon dialect because of the modern city's media influence and economic clout. In the past, the Mandalay dialect represented standard Burmese. The most noticeable feature of the Mandalay dialect is its use of the first person pronoun \"kya.nau\" by both men and women, whereas in Yangon, the said pronoun is used only by male speakers while \"kya.ma.\" is used by female speakers. Moreover, with regard to kinship terminology, Upper Burmese speakers differentiate the maternal and paternal sides of a family whereas Lower Burmese speakers do not.\n\nSpoken Burmese is remarkably uniform among Burmese speakers, particularly those living in the Irrawaddy valley, who all use variants of Standard Burmese. The first major reason for the uniformity is the traditional Buddhist monastic education system, which encouraged education and uniformity in language throughout the Upper Irrawaddy valley, the traditional homeland of the Bamar people.\n\nAccording to the 1891 British census conducted five years after the annexation of the entire country, Konbaung Burma had an \"unusually high male literacy\" rate where 62.5% of age 25 and over in Upper Burma could read and write. The figure would have been much higher if non-Bamars (e.g., Chins, Kachins, etc.) were excluded. For the whole country, the literacy rate was 49% for men and 5.5% for women.\n\nThe migration of Burmese speakers of Bamar descent to Lower Burma is relatively recent. As late as the mid-1700s, the Austroasiatic language Mon was the principal language of Lower Burma and the Mon people who inhabited it. After the Burmese-speaking Konbaung Dynasty's victory over the Mon-speaking Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom in 1757, the shift to Burmese began in Lower Burma. By 1830, an estimated 90% of the population in the region identified themselves as Bamar (and, as such, Burmese speakers) due the influx from Upper Burma, assimilation, and intermarriage. In the British colonial era, British incentives, particularly geared toward rice production, as well as political instability in Upper Burma, accelerated this migration.\n\nMore distinctive non-standard varieties emerge as one moves farther away from the Irrawaddy River valley toward peripheral areas of the country. These varieties include the Yaw, Palaw, Myeik (Merguese), Tavoyan and Intha dialects. Despite substantial vocabulary and pronunciation differences, there is mutual intelligibility among most Burmese dialects. Dialects in Tanintharyi Region, including Palaw, Merguese and Tavoyan, are especially conservative in comparison to Standard Burmese. The Tavoyan and Intha dialects have preserved the medial, which is otherwise only found in Old Burmese inscriptions. They also often reduce the intensity of the glottal stop. Myeik has 250,000 speakers while Tavoyan has 400,000.\n\nThe most pronounced feature of the Arakanese language of Rakhine State is its retention of the sound, which has become a sound in standard Burmese. Also, Arakanese features a variety of vowel differences, including the merger of the and vowels. Hence, a word like \"blood\" is pronounced in standard Burmese and in Arakanese.\n\nBurmese is a diglossic language with two distinguishable registers (or diglossic varieties):\n\nThe literary form of Burmese retains archaic and conservative grammatical structures and modifiers (including particles, markers and pronouns) no longer used in the colloquial form. In most cases, the corresponding grammatical markers in the literary and spoken forms are totally unrelated to each other. Examples of this phenomenon include the following lexical items:\n\nHistorically the literary register was preferred for written Burmese on the grounds that \"the spoken style lacks gravity, authority, dignity\". In the mid-1960s some Burmese writers spearheaded efforts to abandon the literary form, asserting that the spoken vernacular form ought to be used.\nSome Burmese linguists such as Minn Latt, a Czech academic, proposed moving away from the high form of Burmese altogether. Although the literary form is heavily used in written contexts (literary and scholarly works, radio news broadcasts, and novels), the recent trend has been to accommodate the spoken form in informal written contexts. Nowadays, television news broadcasts, comics, and commercial publications use the spoken form or a combination of the spoken and simpler, less ornate formal forms.\n\nThe following sample sentence reveals that differences between literary and spoken Burmese mostly occur in grammatical particles:\n\nIn general, the male-centric names of old Burmese for familial terms have been replaced in standard Burmese with formerly female-centric terms, which are now used by both sexes. One holdover is the use of (younger brother to a male) and (younger brother to a female). Terms like (elder brother to a male) and (younger sister to a male) now are used in standard Burmese only as part of compound words like (brothers) or (brother and sister).\n\nReduplication is prevalent in Burmese and is used to intensify or weaken adjectives' meanings. For example, \"beautiful\" is reduplicated, the intensity of the adjective's meaning increases. Many Burmese words, especially adjectives with two syllables, such as \"beautiful\", when reduplicated ( → ) become adverbs. This is also true of some Burmese verbs and nouns (e.g. \"a moment\" → \"frequently\", which become adverbs when reduplicated.\n\nSome nouns are also reduplicated to indicate plurality. For instance, \"country\", but when reduplicated to \"country\", means \"many countries,\" as in \"international\". Another example is , which means \"a kind,\" but the reduplicated form means \"multiple kinds.\"\n\nA few measure words can also be reduplicated to indicate \"one or the other\":\n\nThere is no official romanization system for Burmese. There have been attempts to make one, but none have been successful. Replicating Burmese sounds in the Latin script is complicated. There is a Pali-based transcription system in existence, MLC Transcription System which was devised by the Myanmar Language Commission (MLC). However, it only transcribes sounds in formal Burmese and is based on the orthography rather than the phonology.\n\nSeveral colloquial transcription systems have been proposed, but none is overwhelmingly preferred over others.\n\nTranscription of Burmese is not standardized, as seen in the varying English transcriptions of Burmese names. For instance, a Burmese personal name like may be variously romanized as Win, Winn, Wyn, or Wynn, while may be romanized as Khaing, Khine, or Khain.\n\nThe Burmese script can be entered from a standard QWERTY keyboard, and is supported within the Unicode standard, meaning it can be read and written from most modern computers and smartphones.\n\nBurmese has complex character rendering requirements, where tone markings and vowel modifications are noted using diacritics. These can be placed before consonants (as with ), above them (as with ) or even around them (as with ). These character clusters are built using multiple keystrokes. In particular, the inconsistent placement of diacritics as a feature of the language presents a conflict between an intuitive WYSIWYG typing approach, and a logical consonant-first storage approach.\n\nSince its introduction in 2007, the most popular Burmese font, Zawgyi, has been near-ubiquitous in Myanmar. Linguist Justin Watkins argues that the ubiquitous use of Zawgyi harms Myanmar languages, including Burmese, by preventing efficient sorting, searching, processing and analyzing Myanmar text through flexible diacritic ordering.\n\nZawgyi is not Unicode-compliant, but occupies the same code space as Unicode Myanmar font. As it is not defined as a standard character encoding, Zawgyi is not built in to any major operating systems as standard. However, allow for its position as the \"de facto\" (but largely undocumented) standard within the country, telcos and major smartphone distributors (such as Huawei and Samsung) ship phones with Zawgyi font overwriting standard Unicode-compliant fonts, which are installed on most internationally-distributed hardware. Facebook also supports Zawgyi as an additional language encoding for their app and website. As a result, almost all SMS alerts (including those from telcos to their customers), social media posts and other web resources may be incomprehensible on these devices without the custom Zawgyi font installed at the operating system level. These may include devices purchased overseas, or distributed by companies who do not customize software for the local market.\n\nKeyboards which have a Zawgyi keyboard layout printed on them are the most commonly available for purchase domestically.\n\nUntil recently, Unicode compliant fonts have been more difficult to type than Zawgyi, as they have a stricter, less forgiving and arguably less intuitive method for ordering diacritics. However, intelligent input software such as Keymagic and recent versions of smartphone soft-keyboards including Gboard and ttKeyboard allow for more forgiving input sequences and Zawgyi keyboard layouts which produce Unicode-compliant text.\n\nA number of Unicode-compliant Burmese fonts exist. The national standard keyboard layout is known as the Myanmar3 layout, and it was published along with the Myanmar3 Unicode font. The layout, developed by the Myanmar Unicode and NLP Research Center, has a smart input system to cover the complex structures of Burmese and related scripts.\n\nIn addition to the development of computer fonts and standard keyboard layout, there is still a lot of scope of research for the Burmese language, specifically for Natural Language Processing (NLP) areas like WordNet, Search Engine, development of parallel corpus for Burmese language as well as development of a formally standardized and dense domain-specific corpus of Burmese language.\n\n\n"}

A team of VIP judges decides which seed company has grown the best \"indica\", \"sativa\" and hybrid strain and which company has produced the best Neder hash (hashish that is produced only in the Netherlands) and best imported hash. The \"High Times\" Cannabis Cup also includes live music, educational seminars and an expo for marijuana-related products from cannabis-oriented businesses.\n\nIn 2010, \"High Times\" mounted its first Cannabis Cup in the United States. The magazine now holds Cannabis Cups in Northern and Southern California, Denver, Michigan, Seattle, with plans to hold a Cannabis Cup in Portland in 2015. The \"High Times\" Medical Cannabis Cup celebrates medical marijuana in states that have passed medical marijuana laws. The U.S. Cannabis Cup celebrates marijuana in states that have passed laws that legalize marijuana for adult, recreational use. Like the \"High Times\" Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam, marijuana strains are judged and Cups (trophies) are awarded in a number of categories.

A substantial dish prepared with meat and vegetables, it is most popular during the winter but is served throughout the year in some restaurants.\n\nThe origins of the dish are uncertain, but most sources agree that probably it was created during the Middle Ages as an evolution of the Sephardic dish adafina. Long-cooking dishes were indispensable for Jews as they allowed hearty meals during Shabbat. These first versions were kosher, using eggs and without pork. Within time, adafina was soon popular elsewhere.\n\nThe growth of anti-Semitism and the Inquisition during the 15th and 16th centuries modified the dish substantially, as the fear of being denounced as Jewish forced Christians and \"Marranos\" (converted Jews) alike to prove themselves as Christians by incorporating pork into their meals. Soon lard, bacon, \"chorizo\" (pork sausage) and \"morcilla\" (blood sausage) were added to the dish.\n\nFrom these origins, the recipe allowed few modifications and was soon established as a staple of Madrid cuisine. During the growth of the city in the 19th and 20th centuries, its low cost and heartiness made it a popular order in small restaurants and the taverns catering to manual workers. After the Civil War, the austerity period, followed by the introduction of more convenient meals, reduced the public popularity of the dish.\n\nThe main ingredient of \"cocido\" is the chickpea or \"garbanzo\". Vegetables are added: potatoes mainly, but also cabbage, carrots, and turnips. In some cases, green bean, mangold and cardoon are also added.\n\nThe meat used is fundamentally pork: pork belly, usually fresh, but sometimes cured (some purists even insist to a point of rancidity); fresh (unsmoked) \"chorizo\"; onion \"morcilla\", and dried and cured jamón serrano. Beef shank is also added; the fat content (\"flor\") of the piece is highly prized. Chicken (especially old hens) is also part of the \"cocido\".\n\nTwo bone pieces (ham bone and beef spine bone) are added to enrich the stock.\n\nFor some recipes, the final touch is the \"bola\", a meatball-like mix of ground beef, bread crumbs, parsley and other spices, which, it is said, was created as a substitute of the eggs used in the \"adafaina\".\n\nTradition rules that the ingredients of \"cocido\" must be served separately. Each serving is known as a \"vuelco\" (tipping or emptying out), as at each time the pot must be emptied out to separate the ingredients.\n\nThe first \"vuelco\" is to separate the stock of the \"cocido\" and serve it with noodles added. The second \"vuelco\" consists of the chickpeas and the vegetables. The third \"vuelco\" is the meat dish.\n\nTraditionally, dishes made with the leftovers of the \"cocido\" include Spanish \"croquetas\" (croquettes), \"ropa vieja\" and \"pringá\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1519875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1519875", "title": "Disability studies", "text": "Disability studies\n\nDisability studies is an academic discipline that examines the meaning, nature, and consequences of disability. Initially the field focused on the division between \"impairment\" and \"disability\", where impairment was an impairment of an individual's mind or body, while disability was considered a social construct. This premise gave rise to two distinct models of disability: the social and medical models of disability. In 1999 the social model was universally accepted as the model preferred by the field. However, in recent years, the division between the social and medical models has been challenged. Additionally there has been an increased focus on interdisciplinary research. For example, recent investigations suggest using \"cross-sectional markers of stratification\" may help provide new insights on the non-random distribution of risk factors capable of acerbating disablement processes.\n\nDisability studies courses include work in disability history, theory, legislation, policy, ethics, and the arts. However, students are taught to focus on the lived experiences of individuals with disabilities in practical terms. The field is focused on increasing individuals with disabilities access to civil rights and improving their quality of life.\n\nDisability studies emerged in the 1980s primarily in the US, the UK, and Canada. In 1986, the Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability of the Social Science Association (United States) was renamed the Society for Disability Studies. The first US disabilities studies program emerged in 1994, at Syracuse University. The first edition of the Disabilities Studies Reader (one of the first collections of academic papers related to disability studies) was published in 1997. The field grew rapidly over the next ten years. In 2005, the Modern Language Association established disability studies as a “division of study.” \n\nUniversities have long studied disabilities from a clinical perspective. In 1986 the Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability of Social Science Association was renamed the Society for Disability Studies and its journal \"Disability Studies Quarterly\" was the first journal in disability studies. The first US disabilities studies program emerged in 1994, at Syracuse University. However, courses and programs were very few. In the 1997 first edition of the \"Disability Studies Reader\" Lennard J. Davis wrote that \"it had been virtually impossible to have someone teaching about disability within the humanities\". In the second edition, written ten years later, he writes that \"all that has changed\", but \"just because disability studies is on the map, does not mean that is easy to find\".\n\nStill the field continued to grow throughout the 2000s. In 2009 Disability Studies Quarterly published a A Multinational Review of English-language Disability Studies Degrees and Courses. They found that from 2003 to 2008 the number of disability studies stand alone studies courses in the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada grew from 56 to 108 and the number of degree granting courses grew from 212 to 420. A total of 17 degrees in disability studies were offered, with 11 programs in the US, 2 in the UK, 3 in Canada, and one in Australia.\n\nA 2014 New York Times article \"Disability Studies: A New Normal\" suggests that the expansion in disability studies programs is related to the 1990 passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Those raised after the passage of the ADA have entered colleges and the workforce, as Disability Studies has grown. In a 2014 article, Disability Studies Quarterly published an analysis on the relationships between student run groups and disability studies, from 2008 to 2012. Their article analyzes groups at four different universities and describes how professors have incorporated student activism into their curriculum and research.\n\nAccording to the transnational Society for Disability Studies:\n\"Using an interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary approach. Disability sits at the intersection of many overlapping disciplines in the humanities, sciences, and social sciences. Programs in Disability Studies should encourage a curriculum that allows students, activists, teachers, artists, practitioners, and researchers to engage the subject matter from various disciplinary perspectives.\n\n\nThe social model of disability is expanded to chronic illness and to the broader work of the medical humanities. Practitioners are working towards improving the healthcare for disabled people through disability studies. This multi-disciplinary field of inquiry draws on the experiences and perspectives of people with disabilities to address discrimination. Infinite Ability has done some preliminary work in India to introduce disability studies to medical students.\n\nFeminism introduces the inclusion of intersectionality in disability studies. It focuses on race, gender, sexuality, class and other related systems of oppression that can also intersect with having a disability. From a feminism standpoint, there is a large concern for grasping multiple positions and differences among social groups. Some research on intersectionality and disability has focused on the aspect of being part of two or more stigmatized groups and how these are contributing factors to multiple forms of harassment, the paradox known as \"Double Jeopardy\".\n\nRecent scholarship has included studies that explore the intersection between disability and race. Ellen Samuels explores gender, queer sexualities, and disability. Christopher Bell’s posthumous volume on \"Blackness and Disability\"; and the work of Robert McRuer both explore queerness and disability. These works engage with issues of neoliberal economic oppression. Scholars of Feminist Disability Studies include Rosemarie Garland-Thomson and Alison Kafer. The 2009 publication of Fiona Kumari Campbell’s \"Contours of Ableism: The Production of Disability and Abledness\" signalled a new direction of research — studies in ableism, moving beyond preoccupations with disability to explore the maintenance of abledness in sexed, raced and modified bodies. Similarly, recent work has focused on the intersections of race and ethnicity with disability in the field of education studies and attempted to bridge Critical Race Studies with Dis/ability studies. This work reflects an effort to deal with complex histories of marking racially \"othered\" bodies as physically, psychologically, or morally deficient, and traces this history of scientific racism to contemporary dynamics. Empirical studies show that minority students are disproportionately more likely to be removed from class or school for \"behavioral\" or academic reasons, and far more likely to be labeled with intellectual or learning disabilities. The authors propose a union of critical race and disability studies, DisCrit, as an intersectional approach designed to analyzing the interaction between ableism, sexism, and racism.\n\nIn addition to work by individual scholars, disability studies organizations have also begun to focus on disability and race and gender. The Society for Disability Studies created the Chris Bell Memorial Scholarship to honor Bell's commitment to diversity in disability studies. Postsecondary disability studies programs increasingly engage with the intersectionality of oppression. The University of Manitoba offers a course in on \"Women with disabilities\". Several recent masters' student research papers at York University focus on issues related to women with disabilities and people of African descent with disabilities.\n\nFeminism integrates the social and political aspects that makes a body oppressed while allowing empowerment to be present in acknowledging its culture. Rosemarie Garland-Thomson explains that these related systems of oppression pervades all aspects of culture by \"its structuring institutions, social identities, cultural practices, political positions, historical communities, and the shared human experience of embodiment\". Garland-Thomson further describes that \"identity based critical enterprises have enriched and complicated our understandings of social justice, subject formation, subjugated knowledges and collective action\". Feminism works towards accessibility for everyone regardless of which societal oppressive behavior makes them a minority. Although physical adjustments are most commonly fought for in disability awareness, psychological exclusion also plays a major role oppressing people with disabilities. Sara Ahmed elaborates the mental exclusiveness of privilege in \"Atmospheric Walls\", that there is an atmosphere that surrounds minority bodies which explains why an intersectionally privileged person could be made uncomfortable simply by being in the same room as a person of color, or in this case someone with a disability. Feminists and scholars also developed theories that put attention on the connection of gender and disability. Scholars like Thomas J. Gerschick argued that disability plays a big role on processing and experiencing gender, and people with disabilities often suffer stigmatization towards their gender, since their disabilities may make their body representation excluded by normative binary gender representation. Gerschick also argues that this stigmatization can affect the gendering process and self-representation of people with disabilities. Feminists also look into how people with disabilities are politically oppressed and powerless. Abby L. Wilkerson argues that people with disabilities are politically powerless because they are often desexualized, and the lack of sexual agency leads to the lack of political agency. Wilkerson also indicates that the erotophobia towards minority groups like people with disabilities further oppresses them, since it prevents these groups from gaining political power through sexual agency and power.\n\nThe intersectionality of disability and LGBTQ communities is a more modern subject of study in which the relevance, historically, came about mostly in the 1960s and the 1970s with the surge of advocates in the midst of the vocal liberation and civil rights movements. These communities on their own are topics of numerous deliberations, however they also often link in significance in many ways. The significance of the movements however, began to build momentum and most legal recognition in the 1980s. It was from this age of advocacy that the intersectionality of these two minority groups came into a more clear focus, though it is one continuously growing subject of discussion. It was only in 1973 that the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from their list of mental disorders. In addition to this, it was about forty years later in 2013 that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) changed the listing of transgender to “gender dysphoria”.\n\nOne of the most notable circumstances where the case of these two minority rights come together was the court case \"In re Guardianship of Kowalski\", in which an accident that occurred in 1983 left a thirty-six year old Sharon Kowalski physically disabled with severe brain injuries. The court granted guardianship of her to her homophobic parents who refused visitation rights to her long time partner, Karen Thompson. The court case lasted nearly ten years and was resolved by granting Thompson custody in 1991. This was a major victory in the realm of gay rights but also called to attention the validity of rights for those who identified under the queer and disabled spectrum. Numerous support groups emerged from necessity to create safe spaces for those identifying in these specific minority groups such as the founding of the Rainbow Alliance of the Deaf in 1977, the Lesbian Disabled Veterans of America group in 1996 which then became the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Disabled Veterans of America, and the San Francisco Gay Amputees group in 2006.\n\nA 2012 study showed that disability was more common in gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals when compared to heterosexual peers. It was also shown that the gay, lesbian, and bisexual group with disabilities were noticeably younger in age than the heterosexual group. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of mental and physical health between the study groups, a higher statistic of those with queer identities having issues health wise than those straight identifying, reportedly due to the weight of social pressure and discrimination of minority sexual identities.\n\nThough these minority groups do not always intersect, the way they handle their own discrimination, can be compared in similar ways. Being that both the LGBTQ rights movement and the disability rights movements have been defined as minority discrimination movements, it has been said that they are a direct contrast to society normalizing the dominance of heterosexuality and able-bodiedness in its majority population. It is also a large topic of discussion to say that both groups have to undergo the same kind of \"coming out\" process in terms of their sexual identity, gender identity, and disability identity because of the lasting social stigma. \"Coming out\" through sexual identity, gender identity, and disability identity is one example of \"Double Jeopardy\", as they are part of more than one stigmatized group.\n\nQueer studies which emerged from women's studies, brings light towards the different kind of oppression queer and transgender people with disabilities have. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act dismisses gender disphoria because of its moral case against transgender people. Queer studies are commonly associated with people with disabilities who identify as “Crip” and is commonly believed that queer politics must incorporate crip politics. Alison Kafer describes a first person experience of identifying queer and crip both bold reappropriated terms in Kafer's novel, \"Feminist Queer Crip\". Kafer describes the politics of the crip future and \"an insistence on thinking these imagined futures - and hence, these lived presents - differently\". Although many activists with disabilities find empowerment in appropriating the term crip, not all people with disabilities feel comfortable using that identity. There are many different terms used as an alternative to disability, for example Melwood, a nonprofit who uses the term \"differing abilities\", describes the label disability as \"a limitation in the ability to pursue an occupation because of a physical or mental impairment; a disqualification, restriction or disadvantage and a lack of legal qualification to do something, was an inadequate or limiting 'label' for a cross section of people\". Because the term disability has a history of inferiority, it is believed by many that substituting the term will help eliminate the ableism that is embedded within it. Susan Wendell describes ableism in society \"as a structure for people who have no weakness\", this also applies to anyone who has any intersectional disadvantages. Feminism identifies these disadvantages and strategizes how to deconstruct the system that supports marginalizing specific groups of people.\n\nWithin class comes multiple avenues for intersectionality through disability. Disability looks different from a middle class, upper class, and lower class perspective, as well as through race, gender, and ethnicity. One's social class can contribute to when a person becomes disabled, rather it be sooner or later. For example, where there is poverty we will find disability. This poverty can include social, economic, and cultural poverty. Having a disability can contribute to poverty just as poverty can contribute to having a disability. People with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty and be unemployed than those who do not, resulting in lower socioeconomic status.\n\nThe International Association of Accessibility Professionals recognizes six different models for conceptualizing disability: social, medical, cultural affiliation, economic, charity, and functional solutions. Once universally accepted in the field, the social model of disability has recently been challenged. In a 2014 \"Disability Studies Quarterly\" article, students involved in campus disability groups note that they actively seek cures for their chronic illnesses and \"question the rejection of the medical model\" of disability. The cultural affiliation model accepts the person's disability completely and uses it a point of pride in being associated with other people in a similar condition. The economic model recognizes the effect of bodily limitations on a person's ability to work, and there may be a need for economic support or accommodations for the person's disability while the charity model regards people with disabilities as unfortunate and in need of assistance from the outside, with those providing charity viewed as benevolent contributors to a needy population. The functional solutions model of disability is a practical perspective that identifies the limitations (or \"functional impairments\") due to disability, with the intent to create and promote solutions to overcome those limitations. The primary task is to eliminate, or at least reduce, the impact of the functional limitations of the body through technological or methodological innovation. The pragmatism of the functional solution model deemphasizes the sociopolitical aspects of disability, and instead prioritizes inventiveness and entrepreneurship. This is the prevailing opinion behind compliance literature that promotes self-efficacy and self-advocacy skills for people with disabilities preparing for transition to independent living.\n\nThere is discourse within disability studies to analyze the construction of \"mental illness.\" However, few post-structuralist disability scholars have focused their attention to impairments of the mind. According to Carol Thomas, the Reader in Sociology at the Institute for Health Research, Lancaster University, this may be because disability scholars have in the past considered only the barriers confronted by people with physical disabilities. The experience of impairment, cognitive disability, and mental illness had been absent from the discussion.\n\nIt is unclear exactly which perspective of disability scholarship “psychological impairment” can fall under, and this has led to a hesitation on the part of scholars. Scholars such as Peter Beresford (2002) suggest \"the development of a 'social model of madness and distress'\" which would consider impairments of the mind. Yet others may recommend the \"embodied approach,\" to the study of mental illnesses.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "88822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=88822", "title": "Du gamla, du fria", "text": "Du gamla, du fria\n\n\"'\" (, ) is the \"de facto\" national anthem of Sweden. It was originally named \"'\" (, \"Song to the North\"), but the incipit has since been adopted as the title.\n\nAlthough the Swedish constitution makes no mention of a national anthem, \"Du gamla, du fria\" enjoys universal recognition and is used, for example, at government ceremonies as well as sporting events. It first began to win recognition as a patriotic song in the 1890s, and the issue of its status was debated back and forth up until the 1930s. In 1938, the Swedish public service radio company Sveriges Radio started playing it at the end of transmitting in the evenings, which marked the beginning of the de facto status as national anthem the song has had since.\n\nDespite the belief that it was adopted as the national anthem in 1866, no such recognition has ever been officially accorded. A kind of official recognition was when the King Oscar II rose in honour when the song was played, the first time in 1893. In 2000 the Riksdag committee rejected, as \"unnecessary\", a proposal to give the song legally official status, repeated later. The committee concluded that the song has been established as anthem by the people, not by the political system, and that it is good to keep it that way.\nThe original lyrics were written by Richard Dybeck in 1844, to the melody of a variant of the ballad \"Kärestans död\". The ballad type is classified as D 280 in The Types of the Scandinavian Medieval Ballad; the variant from Västmanland that Dybeck reproduced is classified as SMB 133 G. It was recorded by Rosa Wretman in the beginning of the 1840s. Dybeck published the traditional text in \"Folk-lore I\", and the melody in 1845 in his \"Runa\", where he also published his new text \"Sång till Norden\" [\"Song to/of the North\"].\n\nDybeck himself originally wrote the beginning as \"Du gamla, du friska\" (), but in the late 1850s personally changed the lyrics to \"Du gamla, du fria\" (Thou ancient, Thou free). The song was already published in several song books and sung with \"Du gamla, du friska\", but a priest who had known Dybeck got the opportunity to tell the singer most associated with the song, opera singer Carl Fredrik Lundqvist, about the change in the year 1900. From that point on, printings of the \"friska\" version ceased to be seen in song books, but a recording from 1905 where it is sung with \"friska\" still exists. The Swedish composer Edvin Kallstenius made an orchestral arrangement of the national anthem in 1933.\n\nBy the early 20th century, many regarded the song unsuitable as a national anthem. In the 1890s it started getting printed in song books in the section for patriotic songs, but as late as in the 1920s it was occasionally published just as \"folk music\". In 1899 a contest was held for writing a national anthem. It led to Verner von Heidenstam writing his \"Sverige\", but did not lead to any new national anthem.\n\nPatriotic sentiment is notably absent from the text of the original two verses, due to them being written in the spirit of Scandinavism popular at the time (\"Norden\" in general refers to the Nordic countries in Swedish, Norwegian and Danish). After the song started to acquire its informal status as the national anthem, various people wrote additional verses to increase the \"Swedishness\" of the song. The aforementioned Lundqvist wrote his own third verse beginning with \"Jag älskar dig Sverige\" (I love thee, Sweden), Frans Österblom wrote four verses beginning with \"Jag älskar min hembygd\" (\"I love my native area\") and Louise Ahlén in 1910 wrote two verses.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\">\n\\new Staff «\n\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n\\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t\n\\clef treble \\key bes \\major \\tempo 4=76\n\\relative c\" {\n\\addlyrics {\n\\addlyrics {\n»\n</score>\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3929952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3929952", "title": "Ethnoecology", "text": "Ethnoecology\n\nEthnoecology is the scientific study of how different groups of people living in different locations understand the ecosystems around them, and their relationships with surrounding environments.\n\nIt seeks valid, reliable understanding of how we as humans have interacted with the environment and how these intricate relationships have been sustained over time.\n\nThe \"ethno\" (see ethnology) prefix in ethnoecology indicates a localized study of a people, and in conjunction with ecology, signifies people's understanding and experience of environments around them. Ecology is the study of the interactions between living organisms and their environment; enthnoecology applies a human focused approach to this subject. The development of the field lies in applying indigenous knowledge of botany and placing it in a global context.\n\nEthnoecology began with some of the early works of Dr. Hugh Popenoe, an agronomist and tropical soil scientist who has worked with the University of Florida, the National Science Foundation, and the National Research Council. Popenoe has also worked with Dr Harold Conklin, a cognitive anthropologist who did extensive linguistic and ethnoecological research in Southeast Asia. \n\nIn his 1954 dissertation \"The Relation of the Hanunoo Culture to the Plant World\", Harold Conklin coined the term ethnoecology when he described his approach as \"ethnoecological\". After earning his PhD, he began teaching at Columbia University while continuing his research among the Hanunoo.\n\nIn 1955, Conklin published one of his first ethnoecological studies. His \"Hanunoo Color Categories\" study helped scholars understand the relationship between classification systems and conceptualization of the world within cultures. In this experiment, Conklin discovered that people in various cultures recognize colors differently due to their unique classification system. Within his results he found that the Hanunoo uses two levels of colors. The first level consists of four basic terms of colors:; darkness, lightness, redness, and greenness. While, the second level was more abstract and consisted of hundreds of color classifications such as: texture, shininess, and moisture of objects also were used to classify objects.\n\nOther anthropologists had a hard time understanding this color classification system because they often applied their own idea of color criteria to those of the Hanunoo. Conklin's studies were not only the breakthrough of ethnoecology, but they also helped develop the idea that other cultures conceptualize the world in their own terms, which helped to reduce ethnocentric views of those in western cultures. Other scholars such as Berlin, Breedlove, and Raven endeavored to learn more about other systems of environment classifications and to compare them to Western scientific taxonomies.\n\nEthnoscience emphasizes the importance of how societies make sense of their own reality. In order to understand how cultures perceive the world around them, like the classification and organization of the environment, ethnoecology borrows methods from linguistics and cultural anthropology. Ethnoecology is a major part of an anthropologist’s toolkit;  it helps researchers understand how the society conceptualizes their surrounding environment i and that it can determine what the society considers \"worth attending to\" in their ecological system. This information can ultimately be useful for other approaches used in environmental anthropology.\n\nEthnoecology is a field of environmental anthropology, and has derived much of its characteristics from classic as well as more modern theorists. Franz Boas was one of the first anthropologists to question unilineal evolution, the belief that all societies follow the same, unavoidable path towards Western civilization. Boas strongly urged anthropologists to gather detailed ethnographic data from an emic standpoint in order to understand different cultures. Julian Steward was another anthropologist whose ideas and theories influenced the use of ethnoecology. Steward coined the term cultural ecology, the study of human adaptations to social and physical environments, and focused on how evolutionary paths in similar societies result in different trajectories instead of the classic global trends in evolution. This new perspective on cultural evolution was  later named multilineal evolution. Both Boas and Steward believed that a researcher must use an emic standpoint and that cultural adaptation to an environment is not the same for each society. Furthermore, Steward's cultural ecology provides an important theoretical antecedent for ethnoecology. Another contributor to the framework of ethnoecology was anthropologist Leslie White.  White emphasized the interpretation of cultures as systems and laid the foundations for interpreting the intersection of cultural systems with ecosystems as well as their integration into a coherent whole. Altogether, these anthropologists, established the foundations of ethnoecology we see today.\n\nTraditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), also known as Indigenous Knowledge, \"refers to the evolving knowledge acquired by indigenous and local peoples over hundreds or thousands of years through direct contact with the environment.\" It involves the accumulated knowledge, beliefs, and practices widely held by a specific community through their relationship with the environment. In this context, TEK consists of a community’s shared ideas when considering subjects such as the acceptable uses of plants and animals, the best approach to maximizing the potential uses of land, the social institutions in which members of society are expected to navigate, and holistically, their worldview.\n\nThe study of TEK frequently includes critiques of the theoretical division between cultural systems and ecosystems, interpreting humans as an integral part of the whole. Humans, for example, can represent a keystone species in a given ecosystem and can play critical roles in creating, maintaining, and sustaining it . They can contribute to processes such as pedogenesis, seed dispersal, and fluctuations in biodiversity. They can also modify and condition animal behavior in either wild or domesticated species.\n\nTraditional Ecological Knowledge has traditionally focused on what Western science can learn from these communities and how closely their cultural knowledge mirrors scientific structures. It has been argued that this previous understanding of ecological adaptation could have major influences on our ecological actions in the future. \n\nWithin the discipline of Ethnoecology, there is a clear emphasis on those societies that are deemed \"indigenous,\" \"traditional,\" or \"savage,\" a common trend in anthropological pursuits through the 20th century. However, societies exist within a wide range of biomes, and have needs to know and understand clear and present dangers beyond those of harmful plants or how to get the best crop. Cruikshank contends that this may because many see Traditional Ecological Knowledge as a \"static, timeless, and hermetically sealed\" notion. Locked within time and space, there is no opportunity to innovate, and is therefore not found within the very new structures of a post-industrial society, such as that of the United States.\n\nIn this way, ethnoecologies may exist without the bounded notion of the \"other\". For example, social scientists have attempted to understand the markers inner-city youth use to identify a threat to their livelihood, including the wearing of gang colors, tattoos, or protrusions through clothes that may represent or be a weapon. Likewise, concepts are spread about the health and needs of the community as they are related to the area around them. Instilled with recognizing dangers at an early age, and who these threats come from, a set of beliefs are held by the members of the society on how to live in their country, city, or neighborhood. This broadening of the discipline (bordering on human ecology) is important because it identifies the environment as not just the plants and animals, but also the humans and technologies a group of people have access to.\n\nSimilarly, social scientists have begun to use ethnoecological surveys in ethnographic studies in attempts to understand and address topics relevant in Western society as well as prevalent around the world. This includes researching the ways in which people view their choices and abilities in manipulating the world around them, especially in their ability to subsist.\n\nTraditional societies often treat medical issues through the utilization of their local environment. For example, in Chinese herbal medicine people consider how to utilize native plants for healing.\n\nAlmost 80% of the world’s population utilizes ethnobotanical methods as a main source of treatment for illnesses, according to WHO.  In the face of modern climate change, many traditional medicinal practices have been promoted for their environmental sustainability, such as Ayurveda from India.\n\nSee also: Ethnomedicine\n\nAccording to Dove and Carpenter, \"environmental anthropology sits astride the dichotomy between nature and culture, a conceptual separation between categories of nature, like wilderness and parks, and those of culture, like farms and cities.\". It is inherent in this ideology that humans are a polluting factor violating a previously pristine locale.\n\nThis is especially relevant due to the role in which scientists have long understood how humans have worked for and against their environmental surroundings as a whole. In this way, the idea of a corresponding, but not adversarial, relationship between society and culture was once in itself baffling and defiant to the generally accepted modes of understanding in the earlier half of the twentieth century. As time went on, the understood dichotomy of nature and culture continued to be challenged by ethnographers such as Darrell A. Posey, John Eddins, Peter Macbeth and Debbie Myers. Also present in the recognition of indigenous knowledge in the intersection of Western science is the way in which it is incorporated, if at all. Dove and Carpenter contend that some anthropologists have sought to reconcile the two through a \"translation,\" bringing the ethnological understandings and framing them in a modern dialogue.\n\nIn opposition to this paradigm is an attribution to the linguistic and ideological distinctiveness found in the nomenclature and epistemologies. This alone has created a subfield, mostly in recognition of the philosophies in ethnotaxonomy. To define ethnotaxonomy as new or different though, is inaccurate. It is simply placing a different understanding of a long-held tradition in ethnology, discovering the terms in which different peoples use to describe their world and worldviews. It is worth noting that those who seek to use and understand this knowledge have actively worked to both enfranchise and disenfranchise the societies in which the information was held. Haenn has noted that in several instances of working with conservationists and developers, there was a concerted effort to change the ideas of environment and ecology held by the native groups to the land, while plundering any and all texts and information on the resources found there, therefore enabling a resettlement of the land and redistribution of the knowledge, favoring the outsiders.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16279135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16279135", "title": "Ethnofiction", "text": "Ethnofiction\n\nEthnofiction is a neologism which refers to an ethnographic docufiction, a blend of documentary and fictional film in the area of visual anthropology. It is a film type in which, by means of fictional narrative or creative imagination, often improvising, the portrayed characters (natives) play their own roles as members of an ethnic or social group.\n\nJean Rouch is considered to be the father of ethnofiction. An ethnologist, he discovered that a filmmaker interferes with the event he registers. His camera is never a \"candid camera\". The behavior of the portrayed individuals, the natives, will be affected by its presence. Contrary to the principles of Marcel Griaule, his mentor, for Rouch a non-participating camera registering “pure” events in ethnographic research (like filming a ritual without interfering with it) is a pre-concept denied by practice.\n\nAn ethnographer cameraperson, in this view, will be accepted as a natural partner by the actors who play their roles. The cameraperson will be one of them, and may even be possessed by the rhythm of dancers during a ritual celebration and induced in a state of \"cine-trance\". Going further than his predecessors, Jean Rouch introduces the actor as a tool in research.\n\nA new genre was born. Robert Flaherty, a main reference for Rouch, may be seen as the grandfather of this genre, although he was a pure documentary maker and not an ethnographer.\n\nBeing mainly used to refer to ethnographic films as an object of visual anthropology, the term ethnofiction is as well adequate to refer to experimental documentaries preceding and following Rouch's oeuvre and to any fictional creation in human communication, arts or literature, having an ethnographical or social background.\n\nParallel to those of Flaherty or Rouch, ethnic portraits of hard local realities are often drawn in Portuguese films since the thirties, with particular incidence from the sixties to the eighties, and again in the early 21st century. The remote Trás-os-Montes region (see: Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province in Portugal), Guinée Bissau or the Cape Vert islands (ancient Portuguese colonies), which step in the limelights from the eighties on thanks to the work of certain directors (Flora Gomes, Pedro Costa, or Daniel E. Thorbecke, the unknown author of Terra Longe ) are themes for pioneering films of this genre, important landmarks in film history.\nArousing fiction in the heart of ethnicity is something current in the Portuguese popular narrative (oral literature): in other words, the traditional attraction for legend and surrealistic imagery in popular arts inspires certain Portuguese films to strip off realistic predicates and become poetical fiction. This practice is common to many fictional films by Manoel de Oliveira and João César Monteiro and to several docufiction hybrids by António Campos, António Reis and Ricardo Costa. Since the 1960s, ethnofiction (local real life and fantasy in one) is a distinctive mark of Portuguese cinema.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

ArtistShare emphasizes on their website that for each project, the artist is in no way required to relinquish ownership of copyright, as this model is not a work made for hire.\n\nIndiegogo.com<br>\nIndiegogo is a Crowd funding portal that allows users to create a page for their funding campaign, set up an account with PayPal, make a list of \"perks\" for different levels of donation, then create a social media-based publicity effort. Users publicize the projects themselves through Facebook, Twitter and similar platforms. The site takes a 4% fee for successful campaigns. For campaigns that fail to raise their target amount, users have the option of either refunding all money to their contributors at no charge or keeping all money raised minus a 9% fee. Unlike similar sites such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo disburses the funds immediately, when the contributions are collected through the user's PayPal accounts. Indiegogo also offers direct credit card payment acceptance through their own portal. Those funds are disbursed up to two weeks after the conclusion of a campaign.\n\nKickstarter.com<br>\nOften hailed as the most successful and well-known Crowd funding platform. Kickstarter has been featured on CNN, The New York Times, TIME magazine, BBC and Wired Magazine. Kickstarter is a Crowd funding website that has successfully funded everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology. Project creators choose a deadline and a goal minimum of funds to raise. If the chosen goal is not gathered by the deadline, no funds are collected. The platform is open to backers from anywhere in the world and to creators from the US or the UK. Kickstarter takes a 5% fee and Amazon.com takes an additional 3%.\n\nPledgeMusic.com<br>\nPledgeMusic is an international Crowd funding platform geared specifically toward musicians. Users (Pledgers) receive exclusive content in exchange for their contributions to artists fundraising campaigns. PledgeMusic does not retain any ownership or rights to any music created through the platform. Funding transactions occur only after a goal is successfully met. The site is staffed my music industry moguls and maintains partnerships with major players in the digital and physical music spheres allowing for numerous options to help record, produce, manufacture, market, and distribute artist's music, merchandise, and tickets. The site charges a 15% flat fee. PledgeMusic operates on two types of artist campaigns, direct-to-fan and a Pre-order campaign. In a pre-order campaign, fans are charged immediately upon pledging. This type of campaign is designed for labels and artists who have already completed a recording, and are looking for a strategic way to pre-sell and market it.\n\nRocketHub.com<br>\nRocket Hub is an established crowd funding platform open to anyone including musicians. Project holders on Rocket Hub have the option to keep raised proceeds even if the fundraising pledge was not successful. Rocket Hub is a completely open platform, meaning that anyone can create a fan-funding campaign and there is no screening process before the project goes live. The site takes an 8% commission off successful projects.\n\nSellaband.com<br>\nSellaband is a crowd funding platform that allows registered Artists to use a direct-to-fan approach to finance albums or concerts. Artists will pledge an amount, the minimum funding target being € 3000, and the maximum funding target, €250.000. Artists may also choose if they want to integrate a revenue sharing option into their funding. The minimum incentive is a download.\n\nThe British rock band Marillion are considered to be one of the first artists to have truly harnessed the power of the internet as a means of music distribution and direct contact with fans, which began with setting up a website in 1996 and raising $60,000 to help finance a 1997 North American tour. They have also been described by \"The Guardian\" music journalist Alexis Petridis as \"the undisputed pioneers\" of the fan-funded music model, beginning with the distribution of their 2001 release \"Anoraknophobia\". Amidst a dissolving relationship with their record label and management team, the band calculated that they would need 5,000 fans to order the album to finance the project. However, they needed the money up-front, before the record was released. They turned to their mailing list and asked fans to pre-order the album in what was later described by the BBC as \"a unique funding campaign\". Pre-sales well exceeded their 5,000-unit target (reaching about 12,000 pre-sales total). Marillion have since released several other albums based on a fan-funded model, receiving a £360,000 advance for their 15th studio album \"Happiness Is the Road\".\n\nUnofficially dubbed the \"queen\" of Kickstarter, Amanda Palmer is an example of one of the most successful fan-funded music campaigns of all time. On April 30, 2012, Palmer ran a campaign on Kickstarter, with a goal of $100,000 to fund her newest studio album, \"Theatre Is Evil\". By the end of May 2012, Palmer had amassed almost $1.2 million, ultimately receiving donations from nearly 25,000 individuals. By comparison, the average successful project on Kickstarter at the time raised about $5,000.\n\nBoston-based singer/songwriter Ellis Paul is another important case study in the field of fan-funded music. His 2010 release, The Day After Everything Changed, was funded completely by fan donations. Instead of using a traditional crowd-funding platform, he adapted the online merchandise platform Nimbit to his own fan-funding scheme. Paul set up a tiered donation hierarchy, ranging from the $15 Street Busker level, up to the $10,000 Woody Guthrie level. Fans received different perks based on the tier at which they donated. The project proved to be highly successful, with total donations exceeding $100,000. Paul is putting his fan-funding to the test again; he is currently in the midst of fan-funding a new studio album set to release sometime in 2013.\n\nTokyo-based garage metal band Electric Eel Shock is another group that has seen some success in the way of fan-funded music. In 2004 they offered a \"SAMURAI 100\" package, which gave fans the opportunity to secure \"guest list for life\" status. The package cost £100 and the band raised £10,000 by selling 100 such packages.\n\nAs a business practice, fan-funded music is not without its criticism. Fan-funded music has gained popularity in the past few years however, money raised through these platforms still is only estimated to make up 1% of the amount spent on albums and tours. Many bands start off with fan funding to finance their initial album but then get signed to a record label. Major labels are signing artists with successful fan funded campaigns using the campaigns as a filter before investing in them. Other, more well-known bands have used fan funding to distance themselves from their label contracts and manage their own music. There has yet to be a band that has used fan funding to fully finance their career. In 2001, \"The Guardian\" journalist Gareth McLean was scathing of Marillion's pioneering efforts to continue their career without a label by dealing directly with their fans on the Internet, writing: \"They have, they explained, decided to eschew the machinations of the record industry in order to be closer to the people. (One suspects that their decision occurred round about the time that the record industry decided to shun Marillion).\"\n\nSome claim that artists overestimate the cost of recording an album and dishonestly solicit more money than they need via fan-funding. With advancements in digital technology, recording equipment has become increasingly compact and more affordable. It is no longer a requirement for an artist to need a large recording studio that houses oversized equipment. This increase in accessibility that the everyday musician has today has made it possible for artists to record their own albums from their homes. Since there are no restrictions for what artists can ask for, it is not unheard of for artists to inflate the expected costs and then keep the extra money as profit.\n\nCritics also point out that the fan-funded music model has turned bands into marketers and sales personnel. Artists must be able to develop personal marketing strategies in order to get the money to even begin working on their music. Artists must put lots of time and effort into creating a campaign that engages their fans and gets them to donate to their project. This can prove difficult for any artist to create a campaign that does not come off as \"[a] shrill and desperate-modern-day pan-handling by entitled go-getters.\" While fan-funded platforms are accessible for any musician, they have become over-crowded with both artists and anyone with an idea. \"For every legitimately exciting pitch there are dozens of musicians, filmmakers and designers pleading for funds to complete ill-conceived projects.\"\n\nRunning fan-funded campaigns cost bands a large sum of money. They must pay for video production for the video that every campaign has, a producer and an engineer to mix and master their album, and fulfill all of the rewards promised to their fans as well as the shipping on them. Often the money made off these projects ends up going to paying the costs of running a successful fan funded campaign. For example, a large portion of the $1 million that Amanda Palmer raised went into funding her Kickstarter project itself. Artists such as Palmer have huge fan bases to appeal to for money, but for the average artist raising that kind of money isn't a reliable method.\n\n"}
{"id": "352591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=352591", "title": "Haka", "text": "Haka\n\nThe haka (; plural \"haka\", in both Māori and English) is a ceremonial dance or challenge in Māori culture. It is a posture dance performed by a group, with vigorous movements and stamping of the feet with rhythmically shouted accompaniment. Although commonly associated with the traditional battle preparations of male warriors, haka have been performed by both men and women, and several varieties of the dance fulfil social functions within Māori culture. Haka are performed to welcome distinguished guests, or to acknowledge great achievements, occasions or funerals.\n\n\"Kapa haka\" (performing arts, ) groups are very common in schools. The main Māori performing arts competition, Te Matatini, takes place every two years.\n\nNew Zealand sports teams' practice of performing a haka before their international matches has made the haka more widely known around the world. This tradition began with the 1888–89 New Zealand Native football team tour and has been carried on by the New Zealand rugby union team (\"All Blacks\") since 1905. However, this is considered by some Māori to be a form of cultural appropriation.\n\nThe group of people performing a haka is referred to as a \"kapa haka\" (\"kapa\" meaning \"row\" or \"rank\"). The Māori word \"haka\" has cognates in other Polynesian languages, for example: Tongan \"haka\", 'hand action while singing'; Samoan \"saa\", Tokelau \"haka\", Rarotongan \"aka\", Hawaiian \"haa\", Marquesan \"haka\", all meaning 'dance'; Mangarevan \"aka\", 'to dance in traditional fashion; dance accompanied by chant, usually of a warlike nature'. In some languages, the meaning is divergent, for example in Tikopia \"saka\" means to 'perform rites in traditional ritual system'. The form reconstructed for Proto-Polynesian is \"*saka\", deriving ultimately from Proto-Oceanic \"*saŋka(g)\".\n\nAccording to Kāretu, the haka has been \"erroneously defined by generations of uninformed as 'war dances'\", whereas Māori mythology places haka as the dance \"about the celebration of life\". According to its creation story, the sun god, Tama-nui-te-rā, had two wives, the Summer Maid, Hine-raumati, and the Winter Maid, Hine-takurua. Haka originated in the coming of Hine-raumati, whose presence on still, hot days was revealed in a quivering appearance in the air. This was the haka of Tāne-rore, the son of Hine-raumati and Tama-nui-te-rā. Hyland comments that \"[t]he haka is (and also represents) a natural phenomena; on hot summer days, the 'shimmering' atmospheric distortion of air emanating from the ground is personified as 'Te Haka a Tānerore'\".\n\nJackson and Hokowhitu state, \"haka is the generic name for all types of dance or ceremonial performance that involve movement.\" The various types of haka include \"whakatū waewae\", \"tūtū ngārahu\" and \"peruperu\". The \"tūtū ngārahu\" involves jumping from side to side, while in the \"whakatū waewae\" no jumping occurs. Another kind of haka performed without weapons is the \"ngeri\", the purpose of which was to motivate a warrior psychologically. The movements are very free, and each performer is expected to be expressive of their feelings. \"Manawa wera\" haka were generally associated with funerals or other occasions involving death. Like the \"ngeri\" they were performed without weapons, and there was little or no choreographed movement.\n\nWar haka (') were originally performed by warriors before a battle, proclaiming their strength and prowess in order to intimidate the opposition. Various actions are employed in the course of a performance, including facial contortions such as showing the whites of the eyes ('), and poking out the tongue (\"\", performed by men only), and a wide variety of vigorous body actions such as slapping the hands against the body and stomping of the feet. As well as chanted words, a variety of cries and grunts are used. Haka may be understood as a kind of symphony in which the different parts of the body represent many instruments. The hands, arms, legs, feet, voice, eyes, tongue and the body as a whole combine to express courage, annoyance, joy or other feelings relevant to the purpose of the occasion.\n\nThe earliest Europeans to witness the haka were invariably struck by its vigour and ferocity. Joseph Banks, who accompanied James Cook on his first voyage to New Zealand in 1769, later recorded, \"The War Song and dance consists of Various contortions of the limbs during which the tongue is frequently thrust out incredibly far and the orbits of the eyes enlargd so much that a circle of white is distinctly seen round the Iris: in short nothing is omittd which can render a human shape frightful and deformd, which I suppose they think terrible.\"\n\nFrom their arrival in the early 19th century, Christian missionaries strove unsuccessfully to eradicate the haka, along with other forms of Māori culture that they saw as conflicting with Christian beliefs and practice. Henry Williams, the leader of the Church Missionary Society mission in New Zealand, aimed to replace the haka and traditional Māori chants (\"waiata\") with hymns. Missionaries also encouraged European harmonic singing as part of the process of conversion.\n\nThe use of the haka in welcoming ceremonies for members of British royal family helped to improve its standing among Europeans. Prince Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh, was the first royal to visit New Zealand, in 1869. Upon the Duke's arrival at the wharf in Wellington, he was greeted by a vigorous haka. The \"Wellington Independent\" reported, \"The excitement of the Maoris becomes uncontrollable. They gesticulate, they dance, they throw their weapons wildly in the air, while they yell like fiends let loose. But all this fierce yelling is of the most friendly character. They are bidding the Duke welcome.\"\n\nIn modern times, various haka have been composed to be performed by women and even children. Haka are performed for various reasons: for welcoming distinguished guests, or to acknowledge great achievements, occasions or funerals. The 1888–89 New Zealand Native football team began a tradition by performing the haka during an international tour. The common use of haka by the national rugby union team (\"All Blacks\"; since 1905) has made one type of haka familiar.\n\nThe haka has been a contested source of cultural appropriation. The 1979 annual \"haka party\" parade at the University of Auckland – in which engineering students persisted in parodying the haka by painting male genitals on their body and performing with sexually obscene gestures – was disrupted by a collection of Māori and Pacific Island students (\"He Taua\", or The War Party) headed by Ngā Tamatoa, a prominent Māori activist group. The protesters included Hone Harawira, later a Member of Parliament. Several of the engineering students were assaulted, and members of \"He Taua\" were arrested. Their court case in Auckland sparked anti-racism protests outside the courthouse. \n\nThe choreographed dance and chant popularised around the world by the All Blacks derives from \"Ka Mate\", a brief haka previously intended for extemporaneous, non-synchronized performance, whose composition is attributed to Te Rauparaha (1760s–1849), a war leader of the Ngāti Toa tribe. The \"Ka Mate\" haka is classified as a \"haka taparahi\" – a ceremonial haka. \"Ka Mate\" is about the cunning ruse Te Rauparaha used to outwit his enemies, and may be interpreted as \"a celebration of the triumph of life over death\". Concerns were expressed that the authorship and significance of this haka to the Ngāti Toa were being lost and that it had \"become the most performed, the most maligned, the most abused of all haka\", and was now \"the most globally recognised form of cultural appropriation\". Specific legal challenges regarding the rights of the Ngāti Toa to be acknowledged as the authors and owners of \"Ka Mate\" were eventually settled in agreements between Ngāti Toa and the New Zealand Government and New Zealand Rugby Union, as published in 2009.\n\nIn the 21st century, \"kapa haka\" is offered as a subject in universities, including the study of haka, and is practised in schools and military institutions. In addition to the national Te Matatini competition, local and regional competitions attract dozens of teams and thousands of spectators.\n\nThe All Blacks' use of the haka has become the most widely known, but several other New Zealand sports teams now perform the haka before commencing a game. These include the national rugby league team (\"the Kiwis\"), and the men's national basketball team (\"Tall Blacks\").\n\nIn the lead up to the Rugby World Cup in 2011, flashmob haka became a popular way of expressing support for the All Blacks. Some Māori leaders thought it was \"inappropriate\" and a \"bastardisation\" of haka, despite its popularity. Sizeable flashmob haka were performed in Wellington and Auckland, as well as London, which has a large New Zealander immigrant community.\n\nIn November 2012, a Māori kapa haka group from Rotorua performed a version of the \"Gangnam Style\" dance mixed with a traditional haka in Seoul, celebrating 50 years of diplomatic relations between South Korea and New Zealand.\n\nOn 7 December 2014, at the 2014 Roller Derby World Cup in Dallas, Texas, Team New Zealand performed a haka on roller skates to the Australian Roller Derby team before their bout in the quarter finals. Team New Zealand performed a haka before their debut game against Team USA at the 2011 Roller Derby World Cup, on 1 December 2011; however, it was unexpected and the arena music was still playing. It has since become an expected tradition.\n\nA number of American football teams perform the haka as a pregame ritual. This appears to have begun at Kahuku High School where both the student body and local community includes many Polynesian Hawaiians, Māori, Samoans, Tahitians, and Tongans. The University of Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football team also adopted the haka as a pregame ritual during the 2006 season, and the practice has spread to a number of other teams; however, this has been criticised as inappropriate and disrespectful.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24384740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24384740", "title": "Hereafter (film)", "text": "Hereafter (film)\n\nHereafter is a 2010 American fantasy drama film directed, co-produced, and scored by Clint Eastwood, written by Peter Morgan, and executive produced by Steven Spielberg. The film tells three parallel stories about three people affected by death in similar waysall three have issues of communicating with the dead; Matt Damon plays American factory worker George, who is able to communicate with the dead and who has worked professionally as a clairvoyant, but no longer wants to communicate with the dead; Cécile de France plays French television journalist Marie, who survives a near-death experience during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; and British twins Marcus and Jason (played by Frankie and George McLaren). Bryce Dallas Howard, Lyndsey Marshal, Jay Mohr, and Thierry Neuvic have supporting roles.\n\nMorgan sold the script on spec to DreamWorks in 2008, but it transferred to Warner Bros. by the time Eastwood (who has a long-standing relationship with Warner Bros.) had signed on to direct in 2009. Principal photography ran from October 2009 to February 2010 on locations in London, San Francisco, Paris, and Hawaii.\n\n\"Hereafter\" premiered as a \"Special Presentation\" at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2010. The film was given a limited release on October 15, 2010 and was released across North America on October 22, 2010. Although a box office success, the film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the plot and acting performances, while noting that the movie suffered from a lack of focus on the story.\n\nOn assignment in India, French television journalist Marie Lelay is shopping for souvenirs for her lover Didier's children. She finds a stand where a mother and her daughter work; they sell gifts to Marie for a dollar. Didier looks over the balcony and witnesses the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami coming into shore. It hits as Marie watches from a distance. She grabs hold of the girl and runs away from the shore but is quickly swallowed by the wave. Pulled lifeless from the water, she is resuscitated by rescuers but is left for dead. She gasps back to life after having a near-death experience in which she sees a vision of human figures inhabiting a realm of light, among them the silhouettes of the mother and daughter holding hands. Marie and Didier are soon reunited as the disaster subsides and they return to Paris. Marie's experience, however, interferes with her work performance to the point that Didier (who is also her producer) sends her on a leave of absence to write the book they've discussed, which would add to her prestige.\n\nIn San Francisco, former professional psychic George Lonegan is persuaded against his wishes to perform a reading for Christos, a wealthy client of his brother Billy. A genuine medium with a gift for communicating with the dead, George abandoned his old career because he was unable to deal with the emotional impact of the reunions and the often disturbingly intimate family secrets revealed. While doing the reading, George hears the word June and asks if a date in June means anything to him. Christos at first denies that it means anything, but privately reveals to Billy that June was the name of his late wife's nurse, whom he was in love with for ten years.\n\nIn London, 12-year-old twins Jason and Marcus try desperately to prevent their alcoholic, heroin-addicted mother, Jackie, from losing them to social services. After evading the authorities yet again, the boys' mother sends Jason to the chemist to pick up her detox prescription, having finally decided to get clean. On the way home, Jason is attacked by street thugs, and while trying to escape, he is hit by a van and killed. No longer able to protect his mother, and barely able to cope with life without the brother he idolizes, Marcus is sent to a foster home.\n\nNow writing a book and with more time to contemplate her near-death experience, Marie travels to Switzerland to meet a renowned specialist in the field. As the director of a hospice who has seen her share of dying patients, the doctor describes herself as a former skeptic who was convinced by the evidence that the afterlife exists and that people like Marie have had a genuine view of it. She persuades Marie to write a book on her experience in the hope that the scientific community will ultimately accept the reality of life beyond death.\n\nDesperate for one last reunion with his twin brother, Marcus steals money from his foster parents and goes around London seeking someone to help him contact Jason. He encounters only frauds and pretenders. While he is trying to board the underground at Charing Cross, Jason's cap, which has become a talisman for Marcus, blows off his head. Delayed by trying to find the cap, he misses his train and sees it explode in the tunnel during the 2005 London Bombings.\n\nGeorge enrolls in a cooking class taught by one of San Francisco's leading chefs. Its students are paired-up, resulting in George being partnered with a young woman named Melanie. The two hit it off and after attending their second class decide to put their new culinary skills to use by preparing an Italian dinner at George's place. All goes well until they hear an ill-timed phone message from his brother, which inclines George to reveal his past as a psychic to Melanie. Curious, she presses George to do a reading for her. George explains his reluctance, but acquiesces. They contact the spirit of Melanie's father, who ends the session by asking her forgiveness for what he did to her as a child. Melanie flees George's home in tears, and she doesn't return to the cooking class.\n\nHaving been in talks with a publisher before her trip to Thailand about a biography of François Mitterrand, Marie now stuns them with her new manuscript entitled \"Hereafter: A Conspiracy of Silence\". The publisher rejects the manuscript but soon steers her toward other publishers who might be interested, the most promising of them in London.\n\nMarie learns from Didier that he does not intend on having her back at the job he urged her to take leave of, because her public interest in the hereafter damages her reputation as a serious journalist, and that he is having an affair with the woman who replaced her on the TV news program.\n\nGeorge is laid off from his factory job, and is persuaded by Billy to revive his psychic practice. Still heartbroken over the fiasco with Melanie, he changes his mind and impulsively leaves San Francisco to make a new start elsewhere. He travels to London and listens every night to audiobook readings by Derek Jacobi of Charles Dickens' works. As a Dickens devotee, he also visits the Dickens Museum and attends Jacobi's live reading of Dickens at the London Book Fair. There, one of the presenters is Marie, reading her now published book, \"Hereafter\". While handing a signed copy of her book to George, their hands touch and George has a psychic flash of Marie's tsunami drowning.\n\nMarcus and his foster parents are also at the London Book Fair. Asking leave of them, Marcus spots George, someone he has read about and seen online. Marcus attempts to speak with the medium, who brushes him off and returns to his hotel. Marcus follows him, standing outside the hotel until nightfall. Eventually George asks him in and agrees to do his reading.\n\nThrough George, Jason tells Marcus that he is happy in the afterlife. He instructs Marcus to stop wearing his cap and says it was he who knocked it off his head at the train station. It was used, he says, to keep Marcus from the doomed train but now he must stand on his own. Jason tells him not to fear this \"because we are one\". As Marcus leaves George, he says he is sorry about \"the French woman\" as he could tell that \"you like her.\" The last time we see Marcus, he is visiting his mother in a rehab center. She is visibly better and he is not wearing Jason's cap.\n\nMarcus lets George know where Marie is staying. George leaves an anonymous note for Marie, saying he believes her book to be true. She decides to join the anonymous fan for lunch and discovers George. While she is looking for him, George sees a vision of them kissing at the same meeting. Their shared glimpses of the hereafter having made them appreciate this life all the more, George and Marie sit together in the cafe.\n\nPeter Morgan wrote the script on spec, and it was bought by DreamWorks in March 2008. The deal was reportedly worth a \"low-seven-figure advance\". Executive producer Steven Spielberg was initially concerned that the low-key ending to the script would put audiences off the film, so Morgan rewrote it to be grander. However, subsequent drafts restored the original ending. Following its split from Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks retained the script, and began talks with Clint Eastwood to direct. Eastwood was signed on in November 2008. By the time of Matt Damon's casting in 2009, the script was being developed under the supervision of Eastwood's Malpaso Productions for Warner Bros.. Eastwood was attracted to the script because he was keen to direct a supernatural thriller, and liked how Morgan incorporated real-world events into fiction. Eastwood told \"LA Weekly\", \"There's a certain charlatan aspect to the hereafter, to those who prey on people's beliefs that there's some afterlife, and mankind doesn't seem to be willing to accept that this is your life and you should do the best you can with it and enjoy it while you’re here, and that'll be enough. There has to be immortality or eternal life and embracing some religious thing. I don't have the answer. Maybe there is a hereafter, but I don't know, so I approach it by not knowing. I just tell the story.\"\n\nProduction was based in the United Kingdom, due to tax incentives and funding from the UK Film Council, though filming locations spanned three countries. Filming commenced in France on October 19, 2009. A days filming was done at the old Belle Epoque, Le Grand Hôtel-Restaurant du Montenvers, in the village of Planet, near Chamonix. The hotel building was transformed into a Swiss hospice for scenes between Cécile de France and Marthe Keller. A cordon was set up around the area to prevent local residents and paparazzi taking photographs of the set, though the mayor of Chamonix was allowed through for a brief meeting with Eastwood. Production then moved to Paris for four days. On October 21, a short scene between de France and Mylène Jampanoï was filmed in a stairwell inside the France Télévisions building.\n\nIn the first week of November, production moved to London for three weeks of filming in locations including Bermondsey and in Walworth. Scenes were also filmed on the Heygate Estate. On November 7, scenes were filmed in Petticoat Lane Market and at the Cafe Le Jardin in Bell Lane. Scenes were also filmed in an auditorium at Red Lion Square and at Camberwell New Cemetery. The room was redressed to represent a fictional Center For Psychic Advancement, which the Marcus character visits. De France filmed the underwater scene in a studio tank at Pinewood Studios. After these scenes were shot, production was halted, as Matt Damon was working on another film.\n\nFilming resumed on January 12, 2010; Eastwood filmed scenes with de France for three days on the Hawaiian island of Maui. On the first day, scenes were filmed in the lobby and guest rooms of the Sheraton Maui Resort & Spa in Kaanapali. On January 13, scenes were filmed on Front Street in Lahaina. A hundred crew worked on the scenes. The location managers were given permission by Lahaina authorities to close a small section of the street in order to film scenes depicting \"an unnamed, South Pacific-type outdoor marketplace, complete with outdoor shopping stalls and street vendors\". The location manager explained to the \"Lahaina News\", \"Front Street's proximity to the water and the architecture of its buildings help supply a look that will require much less transformation towards this goal than other locations which were under consideration\". The street was closed off to vehicles on the evening of January 12. The scene—the first scene of the film—depicts Cécile de France's character coming out of her hotel just as a tsunami hits the island. The aftermath of the tsunami was filmed on January 14 at a property in Kapalua. \n\nProduction next moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. On January 19, scenes featuring Damon were shot at the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company refinery in Crockett, California, and the exterior of C&H Sugar is seen on screen. The location was not announced until filming had concluded, for fear that large crowds would gather to watch. Filming also took place in Nob Hill, San Francisco and Emeryville. While production was in the Bay Area, it employed 300 local extras and crew members. Production returned to London on January 29 to shoot Damon's final scenes. On February 3, scenes were filmed at the Charles Dickens Museum. Later in the month, the London Book Fair was recreated inside the Alexandra Palace for a scene featuring George and Marie. Publishers including Random House had their stands built for the three-day shoot, two months before the real London Book Fair took place. Filming wrapped afterwards.\n\nVisual effects work was carried out by Los Angeles-based Scanline VFX. 169 effects were created, the key sequence of which was the tsunami, which features \"full CG water shots and CG water extensions to water plates, digital doubles, CG set extensions, matte paintings, digital make-up fx and full CG environments with extensive destruction, from toppling digital palm trees to colliding digital cars\". An effect described as the \"hereafter effect\" also appears, \"[giving] the viewer glimpses into the afterlife\".\n\nAfter initial speculation by \"Variety\" that the film would be released in December 2010, Warner Bros. announced that \"Hereafter\" would go on general release in the United States and Canada on October 22, 2010.\n\nA pre-release screening of \"Hereafter\" was held on August 10, 2010. The film had its world premiere on September 12, 2010 at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. The theatrical trailer was attached to \"The Town\" and \"Life as We Know It\". \"Hereafter\" was also screened on October 10, 2010 as the Closing Night Film of the 48th New York Film Festival. The film was given a limited release on October 15, 2010.\n\nThe film premiered in Japan on February 19, 2011.\nA few days after the 11 March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the film was withdrawn from all cinemas in that country, two weeks earlier than originally planned. \"Warner Bros. spokesperson Satoru Otani said the film's terrifying tsunami scenes were 'not appropriate' at this time.\"\n\n\"Hereafter\" has received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes reports that 46% of critics - though 59% of \"top critics - have given the film a positive review based on 217 reviews, with an average score of 5.7 out of 10. The critical consensus is: \"Despite a thought-provoking premise and Clint Eastwood's typical flair as director, \"Hereafter\" fails to generate much compelling drama, straddling the line between poignant sentimentality and hokey tedium.\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 56/100 based on 41 reviews. Roger Ebert, however, gave the film four stars (out of four), calling it a film that \"considers the idea of an afterlife with tenderness, beauty and a gentle tact. I was surprised to find it enthralling.\"\n\nThe film received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, but lost to another Warner Bros. film, \"Inception\". It won the Visual Effects Society Award for Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Feature Motion Picture and was also nominated in the category of Outstanding Compositing in a Feature Motion Picture.\n\n"}
{"id": "1774390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1774390", "title": "History of Kolkata", "text": "History of Kolkata\n\nKolkata, formerly known as Calcutta in English, is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal and is located in eastern India on the east bank of the River Hooghly. The city was a colonial city developed by the British East India Company and then by the British Empire. Kolkata was the capital of the British Indian empire until 1911 when the capital was relocated to Delhi. Kolkata grew rapidly in the 19th century to become the second city of the British Empire. This was accompanied by the development of a culture that fused European philosophies with Indian tradition. \n\nKolkata is also noted for its revolutionary history, ranging from the Indian struggle for independence to the leftist Naxalite and trade-union movements. Labelled the \"Cultural Capital of India\", \"The City of Processions\", \"The City of Palaces\", and the \"City of Joy\", Kolkata has also been home to prominent people such as, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Rabindranath Tagore, Keshub Chandra Sen, Jagadish Chandra Bose, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda, Sister Nivedita, Sri Aurobindo, Subhas Chandra Bose, Satyendra Nath Bose, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, Paramahansa Yogananda, Anil Kumar Gain, Kazi Nazrul Islam, Jibanananda Das, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, Mother Teresa, Satyajit Ray, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, Ustad Vilayat Khan and Pandit Ravi Shankar. Problems related to rapid urbanization started to plague Kolkata from the 1930s and the city remains an example of the urbanization challenges of the developing nations.\n\nThere is a long chain of events behind the arrival of the British East India Company in Bengal, specifically Job Charnock in Sutanuti in 1690. These incidents are documented in numerous records of the East India Company and by several authors [Bruce 1810 (Vol I and II), Marshman Vol I, Unknown 1829; see references below]. These documents tell the story of how the English were severely beaten and wiped out from Bengal several times by the forces of the Mughal Emperor and how each time they came back to Bengal to continue their trade.\n\nThe agents of the East India Company first visited the provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha, for trade during the period of Ibrahim Khan (ca 1617-1624), the Subahdar (Governor) of Bengal at the time of Mughal Emperor Jahangir. The first factory was established in Surat in 1620 and later in Agra, and agents were further sent from these places to the eastern provinces to examine the possibility of opening factories there. However the transportation costs and logistics were unfavorable and the plan was abandoned. In January 1644, the daughter of the Emperor was severely burnt and a doctor named Gabriel Boughton, formerly the surgeon of the East Indiaman \"Hopewell\", was sent from Surat for her treatment. \n\nHe was able to successfully treat her burns and in reward the Emperor allowed the company to establish factory at Pipili, Odisha, and for the first time English ships arrived at an eastern port. During 1638, Shah Jahan appointed his son Shah Shuja as the Subahdar of Bengal and Boughton visited the capital at Rajmahal where his services were again used to treat one of the ladies in the palace, and in return, the company was allowed to establish factories in Balasore, Odisha and Hooghly, Bengal in addition to Pipili, Odisha.\n\nShaista Khan was appointed as the governor of Bengal in around 1664 by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and was relieved upon his request in around 1682. While he was returning to Delhi, Englishmen sent with him a request to the Emperor to obtain a special firman to do business forever in Bengal; the Emperor was pleased to provide them the Firman and the occasion was celebrated with a 300 gun salute at Hooghly. The investment in Bengal soared, the Bengal residency was separated from Madras and Mr. Hedges was appointed as the chief officer to oversee trade in Bengal. His residence in Hooghly was secured with soldiers obtained from Madras. This is the first time English soldiers came on the soil of Bengal. However, the Firman was vague in many aspects and soon disputes started to grow between the English and the governor.\n\nDuring this time a local disturbance occurred when the zamindar in Bihar attacked the governor of Bihar. Mr. Peacock, the chief of the factory in Patna, was imprisoned by the governor with the assumption that he was involved in the dispute. At the same time their saltpetre trade was disrupted by another rival British company. To protect their trade in Bengal, the original East India Company requested to build a fort in the mouth of Hooghly or on its banks. This request was immediately turned down by Shaista Khan and a 3.5% tax was imposed in addition to the already existing tax of 3,000 rupees, notwithstanding the Firman obtained earlier. Another incident with the Faujdar of Cossimbazar resulted in altercations between the Governor of Bengal and the company causing their ships to leave Bengal without obtaining cargo.\n\nEnraged with this situation and determined to establish their authority, the company requested King James II in 1685 to permit the use of force against the Emperor’s army to settle the matter. Admiral Nicholson was sent with ships to attack the port at Chittagong, fortify it, make an alliance with the King of Arakan who was against the Mughals, establish a mint and collect revenue, thus making Chittagong a fort city for the British in the eastern part. Then he was ordered to proceed to Dhaka. It was assumed that the governor would abandon the city and then a peace treaty would be offered which would guarantee free trade and other economic benefits for the British and he would give up the territory of Dhaka and Chittagong. Job Charnock was then at Madras and was directed to join the expedition with 400 soldiers from the Madras division.\n\nUnfortunately the plan went awry; some of the ships, due to the change in current and wind, arrived at Hooghly instead of Chittagong and anchored off the factory in Hooghly after being joined by their Madras troops. The presence of a large number of war ships alarmed Shaista Khan and he immediately offered a truce. However the peace was broken again when some British troops misbehaved with Shaista Khan’s troops in Hooghly on 28 October 1686 for which the former were severely beaten by the latter. At the same time the admiral opened fire and burnt down 500 houses; property losses were about thirty lacs of rupees. However a truce was again obtained between Mr. Charnock and the local Foujidar, and the English were allowed to put saltpetre on board their ships. However, Shaista Khan upon hearing this ordered the closing and confiscation of all their factories and properties in Bengal and sent a large force to drive out the English from Hooghly.\n\nUpon hearing the news of Shaista Khan’s plan, Mr. Charnock determined that it was no longer safe to remain in Hooghly and decided to move downstream to Sutanuti, a small hamlet on the banks of the river Hooghly on 20 December 1686. At this time their ships in Bengal required extensive repairs and the remainder of their fleet were considered in danger. In this situation they considered that they would be extremely fortunate if they could hold their current position instead of their desires on Chittagong and for this matter they decided to ask forgiveness from the Emperor and requested to reinstate the previously obtained Firman. \n\nPeace treaty was again offered by the governor at the end of December 1686 but it was mainly to buy out time for attack and by February 1687 a large troop of Shaista Khan’s army arrived at Hooghly to drive the British out of Bengal. Charnock decided it was not safe to remain in Sutanuti and moved to the island village at Hijli. There he remained with his soldiers in an utterly inhospitable place full of mosquitoes, snakes and tigers. The Governor’s troops didn’t bother them there since they knew the British would not be able to survive long there. In fact, within three months about half of Charnock’s soldiers died and the remaining half were ready to be hospitalized.\n\nWith his back to the wall, Charnock was desperately willing to negotiate with Shaista Khan to get out of this mess. Luck favored him because of an unexpected event. At the time when Nicholson was ordered to proceed to Chittagong, Sir John Child was ordered to withdraw the company’s establishment from Bombay, commence hostilities on the western coast, blockade Mughal harbors and attack their ships anywhere to be found. Emperor Aurangzeb wanted to reconcile with the British to ensure uninterrupted voyage of pilgrims to Mecca and asked his governors to make terms with them. \n\nAs a result, a peace treaty was signed between Shaista Khan and Charnock on 16 August 1687. Shaista Khan allowed them to remain in Bengal, however to be limited only to Uluberia, a small town on the bank of river Hooghly south of Sutanuti, where they were allowed to make a port and do business from there, but their war ships were strictly not allowed to enter Hooghly. Charnock arrived at Uluberia, started making a dock there, however soon started to dislike the place and wanted to return to Sutanuti. At this time the governor asked them to return and settle at Hooghly, ordered them not to build any structure at Sutanuti and asked Charnock to pay a large sum of money for compensation. While not in a position to fight against the Governor’s troops, two British agents were sent to Dhaka to plead to the governor to allow them to return to Sutanuti and build a fort there.\n\nAt the same time, when the news of failure of Nicholson reached England, it was decided that until a fort was built on the bank of the river, the English would never be able to do business with ease and would always be on the mercy of the forces of the governor. For this, Captain Heath was sent to Bengal with 160 soldiers either to fight and win against the forces of the governor or to bring back all the properties of the company to Madras and abandon the trade in Bengal. Captain Heath arrived in October 1688 in Bengal, took all of company persons on board, set sail to Balasore on 8 November 1688. He reached Balasore on 29 November, pounded and destroyed the town including their own factory and released some English prisoners from the Governor’s prison. \n\nThey left Balasore on 13 December for Chittagong, reached there on 17 December, found the Governor’s fortification too strong to destroy and decided to wait until his demands are answered by the governor. However, instead of waiting for Governor’s answer, Captain Heath set sail to Arakan, arrived there on 31 January 1689 and offered treaty to the king that English will fight against the Mughals at Dhaka and the king would provide them settlements in his dominion. When a fortnight passed without any answer from the king, Captain Heath, frustrated and dejected, returned to Madras on 4 March 1689. This was a total failure of English objectives in Bengal during the early period of 1689 which caused them abandoning Bengal as their trading location in eastern region.\n\nEmperor Aurangzeb, enraged with the situation that the British fortified in Madras, occupied territory around it, captured Mughal ships, went into alliance with his enemy Sambhaji, he ordered his commanders everywhere in India to exterminate British from the country and seize their properties anywhere to be found. Warehouses in Visakhapatnam were destroyed and many English men were captured and put to death. Shaista Khan went after them in Dhaka, captured them and put them behind bars.\n\nShaista Khan retired from his duty as governor in ca 1689 and Ibrahim Khan was appointed as the new governor of Bengal by Emperor Aurangzeb. By this time Aurangzeb was camping at Visapur and was much aware of the fact that he was losing revenues from the British trade and the British ships could cause him much trouble by stopping the pilgrimage to Mecca since they controlled the sea-route. At the same time, the British were desperate to open negotiations with the Emperor after they left Bengal and Mr. Child was sent to him. He decided to accept the offer and ordered the Governor of Bengal to allow British to return there. \n\nAs a result, Ibrahim Khan invited Mr. Charnock back to Bengal; but Mr. Charnock refused to come back until a specific Firman with terms and conditions clearly specified was issued by the Emperor so that they would not be subjected to further humiliations. Ibrahim Khan again sent letter to Mr. Charnock explaining that he had requested for the special Firman from the Emperor and it would take a few months before it arrived, and in the mean time Mr. Charnock was welcome to settle in Bengal and the governor would pay him 80,000 rupees for the goods that have been destroyed by Shaista Khan’s regime. \n\nWith this friendly invitation, Mr. Job Charnock with 30 soldiers returned to Sutanuti on 24 August 1690 and hoisted the Royal Standards of England on the banks of river Hooghly, thus beginning a new era of British involvement in Bengal. In the next year, Ibrahim Khan sent the order from the Emperor to Mr. Charnock which allowed unrestricted trade without paying any other taxes except the usual 3,000 rupees.\n\nMr. Charnock died in January 1692. While the English were always looking for fortification of their factories in Bengal, Ibrahim Khan never allowed them to do so. In 1695 the town of Hooghly was seized by Sobha Singh along with an unknown Afghan Rahim Khan, and the English at Sutanuti requested from the governor to use their own armed protection for their factories when their factories were surrounded by the enemy. \n\nIbrahim Khan allowed them to protect their own factories, but did not allow any fortification explicitly. However, in the absence of specific orders the permission to defend their property was taken as a permit to build fortress and construction began immediately overnight with all available manpower. The fort was built on the bank of river Hooghly at Sutanuti with mortar brought from Madras, completed in ca 1701 and was called Fort William after King William III of England. This was the old Fort William and construction for a new one (the present one) started after Siraj Ud-Daulah attacked Fort William in 1756.\n\nIn 1690, Job Charnok, an agent of the East India Company chose this place for a British trade settlement. The site was carefully selected, being protected by the Hooghly River on the west, a creek to the north, and by salt lakes about two and a half miles to the east. There were three large villages along the east bank of the river Ganges, named, Sutanuti, Gobindapur and Kalikata. These three villages were bought by the British from the local land lords. The Mughal emperor granted East India Company freedom of trade in return for a yearly payment of 3,000 rupees.\n\nThe rent-roll of [[Akbar]], the 16th century [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor, and the work of a Bengali poet, [[Bipradas Pipilai]], of the late 15th century, both make mention of the city's early name's being \"Kolikata\", from which Kolkata/Calcutta derive.\n\nThere is much discussion about the origin of the city's name. The most accepted view is that it comes from the Hindu goddess [[Kali]] and the original name was \"KaliKshetra\", \"the place of Kali\".\n\nOther theories include:\n\nThe area where the city is now located was originally inhabited by the people of three villages: \"[[Kalikata]]\", \"[[Sutanuti]]\" and \"[[Gobindapur, India|Gobindapur]]\". However, the boundaries of the three villages gradually became less distinct, and before the [[battle of Plassey]], the city could be divided into four different sub-areas: European Kolkata (Dihi Kolkata); a residential village with some sacred spots (Gobindapur); a traditional Indian market (Bazar Kalikata or Burrabazar); and a riverine mart concentrating on cloth trade (Sutanati). After the battle of Plassey in 1757, the British started rebuilding the city with the idea of making it the capital for their empire.\n\nThe [[Calcutta High Court]] ruled in 2003 that [[Job Charnock]], the Englishman generally believed to be the founder of the Calcutta, is not the founder of the city and that hence Kolkata has no birthday. According to the Court, the city has its genesis in the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period and it was an established trading post long before the Slave Dynasty of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], the [[France|French]] or the [[United Kingdom|British]] established a modern township there.\n\nThe [[British East India Company]] chose the place for a trade settlement. In 1698, the East India Company bought three villages (Sutanuti, Kalikata and Gobindapur) from a local landlord family of [[Sabarna Roy Choudhury]]. The next year, the company began developing the city as a [[Presidency City]]. In 1727, on the order of [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]], a civil court was set up in the city. The Calcutta Municipal corporation (now renamed [[Kolkata Municipal Corporation]]) was formed and the city had its first [[mayor]].\n\nThe three villages, in particular \"Kalikata\", where Calcutta is located, came into the possession of the [[British East India Company]] in 1690 and some scholars like to date its beginnings as a major city from the construction of [[Fort William, India|Fort William]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1698, though this is debated (see the court ruling in \"Name and origins\" above). From 1772 to 1911, Calcutta was the capital of British India. From 1912 to India's Independence in 1947, it was the capital of all of [[Bengal]]. After Independence, Calcutta remained the capital of the Indian state of [[West Bengal]].\n\nWhen the [[Seven Years' War]] broke out, owing to their constant rivalry with the [[French East India Company|French]], and the fall of [[Madras]] to the forces of [[Joseph François Dupleix|Dupleix]], early in 1756 the British authorities in Calcutta began repairs to the fortifications of old [[Fort William, India|Fort William]], which were extremely decayed. This irritated the new [[Nawab of Bengal]], [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], who viewed it as a threat to his sovereignty. Enraged still further when the British granted asylum to one Krishnaballav, who had embezzled money from the \"dewani\" of [[Dhaka]], Siraj ud-Daula first attacked and captured [[Cossimbazar]] (taking as hostage [[William Watts]] and [[Begum Johnson]]), and then Calcutta, which fell after a short siege on 20 June 1756, during which the governor and many other officials escaped down the [[Hooghly River]], leaving the remainder of the garrison and the [[Anglo-Indian|Eurasian]] population of Calcutta to their fate. \n\nThis is now known as the [[Siege of Calcutta]]. It is said that 123 Britons later died in the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]] after his victory, but recent evidence calls into question the numbers involved, and suggests that the Nawab himself was probably unaware of what transpired. He renamed Calcutta Alinagar after the previous Nawab, and his maternal grandfather, [[Alivardi Khan]]. Having installed Manikchand as the ruler of Alinagar, Siraj returned to [[Murshidabad]]. Soon (on 2 January 1757) Watson and [[Robert Clive]] retook Calcutta with a force of company [[sepoys]] and the assistance of the [[Royal Navy]]. Hearing the news, Siraj ud-Daula moved to attack Calcutta, but fearing an attack from [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]], after a few days of war he signed the [[Treaty of Alinagar]] with the East India Company, giving them permission to build the fort.\n\nAlthough Siraj ud-Daula conceded temporary defeat in the Pact of Alinagar, he once again began scheming with the French against the British. Meanwhile, the [[Third Carnatic War]] was starting in the south. Also at this time, nobles such as [[Jagat Seth]], [[Mir Jafar]], Rai Durlav, Omichand and Rajballav were plotting against Siraj ud-Daula (a principal reason being the Nawab's arrogance, well attested to in contemporary sources) and they invited Clive to take part in their plans. \n\nClive seized on this plan to get rid of two enemies at once. Citing non-existent reasons, he attacked [[Murshidabad]], having previously reached an agreement with Mir Jafar to install him on the \"musnud\" of Bengal. On the fateful day of 23 June 1757, 23 miles away from Murshidabad in the mango groves of [[Palashi]], the armies met at the [[Battle of Plassey]]. The British army consisted of 800 European soldiers and 2,200 Indian soldiers, while the Nawab's army was made up of 18,000 cavalry and 50,000 infantry. At the start of this seemingly impossible battle, generals Rai Durlav and Iar Latif held their armies together, but in an act of treachery [[Mir Jafar]] led his troops away from the battlefield, and the remaining army led by Mirmadan and Mohanlal was defeated. \n\nSiraj ud-Daula escaped but was later caught and killed by Miran, the son of Mir Jafar. Mir Jafar was made the new Nawab, and the British had effectively seized control of Bengal. In 1765, after defeating the next Nawab, [[Mir Qasim]], the [[Nawab of Oudh]] and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] at the [[Battle of Buxar]], there was no one to stand in the way of the British and their dominance in North India. Thus, British imperialism began in India with the conquest of Bengal, a game in which a main pawn was the great city of Calcutta.\n\nCalcutta also had an indirect but important influence on the battles of the [[Carnatic Wars]]. When Madras fell to Dupleix, the British were still able to direct the war from another of their strongholds, Calcutta. They also used the wealth of Bengal to defeat the French. As Dr. [[R. C. Majumdar]] stated in \"An Advanced History of India\", \"The Battle of Plassey may be truly said to have decided the fate of the French in India.\"\n\n[[St. John's Church, Kolkata|St. John's Church]], originally a cathedral, was among the first public buildings erected by the [[East India Company]] after Kolkata became the effective capital of [[British India]]. It is located at the North-Western corner of [[Raj Bhavan (West Bengal)|Raj Bhavan]], and served as the [[Diocese of Kolkata|Anglican Cathedral of Calcutta]] till 1847, when the see was transferred to [[St. Paul's Cathedral, Kolkata|St. Paul's Cathedral]]. Construction of the building, modelled on [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] of London, started in 1784, with Rs 30,000 raised through a public lottery, and was completed in 1787. It is the third oldest church in the city, next to the Armenian and the [[Old Mission Church]].\n\nOne of the most notorious incidents of the latter part of the century was the trial and execution of [[Maharaja Nandakumar|Nanda Kumar]], who had been the governor of [[Hugging-Coinsurance|Hugging]] in 1756. In 1764 he had been appointed collector of [[Burdwan]] in place of [[Warren Hastings]], which resulted in a long-standing enmity between the two men. In 1775, when Hastings was [[Governor-General]], Nanda Kumar brought accusations of corruption against him, accusing him of accepting bribes and other abuses of power. These were taken up with enthusiasm by Hastings' rivals on the Governor General's Council, led by [[Philip Francis (English politician)|Philip Francis]]. Whilst this matter was still awaiting investigation Nanda Kumar was indicted for forgery of a deed, condemned and executed. There was a strong suspicion that the charges had been invented by Hastings, and that he had put pressure on the judges to pass sentence of death. At this date it was far from clear whether or not English law applied in Calcutta, and it was extremely rare for the death penalty to be applied for forgery even in England. Furthermore, Nanda Kumar was a [[Brahman]], and his hanging caused widespread dismay and outrage in Calcutta. \n\nWarren Hastings and Sir [[Elijah Impey]], the Chief Justice, were both impeached, and were accused by [[Edmund Burke]] and afterwards by [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]] of committing a judicial murder. Five years after this incident, in 1780, relations between Warren Hastings and Philip Francis deteriorated to such an extent that the two fought a duel in the grounds of Belvedere (now the National Library) on the road to the suburb of [[Alipore]]. Francis was severely wounded, but Hastings escaped unscathed.\n\nAfter the territorial conquest of Bengal in 1757, the [[British East India Company]] pursued a monopoly on production and export of opium from India. The company bought opium from local traders and later directly from farmers, and sold it at auction in Calcutta. From there much of it was smuggled to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in [[China]] by foreign traders, eventually leading to the [[First Opium War]] (18391842).\n\nIn 1772, Calcutta became the capital of [[British India]], a decision made by [[Governor General]] [[Warren Hastings]]. On 29 January 1780, \"[[Hickey's Bengal Gazette]]\" or \"the Calcutta General Advertiser\" became the first newspaper to be printed in India, and is an invaluable chronicle of the social life of Anglo-Indian society in Calcutta. Contemporary memoirs such as those of [[William Hickey (memoirist)|William Hickey]] record the consumption of enormous meals, washed down by copious quantities of claret, port, madeira and other wines, followed by the smoking of [[Hookah]]s. After the death of his English wife, Charlotte, (who is buried in [[Park Street Cemetery]]) Hickey married a Bengali girl called Jemdanee, who died in childbirth in 1796, prompting him to write in his journal that \"Thus did I lose as gentle and affectionately attached a girl as ever man was blessed with\". \n\nSuch unions between Europeans, English, French and Portuguese, and local women, both Hindu and Muslim, were common throughout the 18th century in Calcutta, and are the origin of the city's substantial Anglo-Indian (or Eurasian) community today: by the early 19th century, however, increasing racial intolerance made marriages of this kind much rarer.\n\nCalcutta's intellectual life received a great boost in 1784 with the foundation of the [[Asiatic Society of Bengal]] by [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]], with the encouragement of [[Warren Hastings]], himself no mean Oriental scholar. Jones worked closely with the \"[[pandit]]s\" of the [[Kalighat|Kalighat Temple]], together with the local \"[[ulema]]\", in translating and producing new editions of rare and forgotten texts. His study of [[Sanskrit]] with [[Pandit Ramlochan]] at [[Nadia district|Nadiya]] led him to posit the existence of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family of languages. Many distinguished scholars, English and Bengali, such as [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]], [[James Prinsep]] and [[Pandit Radhakanta Sarman]] would grace the society's meetings and publications over the following century, vastly enriching knowledge of India's culture and past. \n\nCalcutta saw the establishment of several different Western-style higher education institutions this period, including [[The Sanskrit College and University|Sanskrit College]] (1824), [[Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata|Calcutta Medical College]] (1835), [[University of Calcutta]] (1857), [[Surendranath College]] (1885) and the [[Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science]] (1887), India's first research institute.\n\nIn the time of [[British India]], Calcutta was regarded as \"the second city of the [[British Empire]]\" (after [[London]]) and was aptly renamed \"City of Palaces\" and the Great Eastern Hotel was regarded as the \"Jewel of the East\".\nCalcutta at that time was famous for its \"[[Baboo Culture]]\", a mixture of English [[Liberalism]], European [[fin de siecle]] decadence, [[Mughal era|Mughal]] conservatism, and [[Hindu revivalism|indigenous revivalism]], inculcating aspects of socio-moral and political change.\nThis culture was fostered in its wake by the [[Zamindari system]], the [[Dayabhaga System]] the [[Hindu Joint Family System]], the [[Mitakshara System]], the Muslim [[Zenana System]], the Protestant spirit of free capitalist enterprise, the Mughal-inspired feudal system and the [[Nautch]].\nThis also fostered the [[Bengal Renaissance]], an awakening of modern liberal thinking in 19th century Bengal, and which gradually percolated to the rest of India.\n\nIn 1750, Calcutta had a population of 120,000. The centre of company control over the whole of Bengal from 1757, Calcutta underwent rapid industrial growth from the 1850s, especially in the textile sector, despite the poverty of the surrounding region. Trade with other nations also grew. For example, the first U.S. merchant ship arrived in Kolkata in 1787. In fact, the U.S Consulate in Calcutta is the U.S. Department of State's second-oldest consulate and dates from 19 November 1792.\n\nDespite being almost totally destroyed by a cyclone, in which 60,000 died, on 5 October 1864, Calcutta grew, mostly in an unplanned way, in the next 150 years from 117,000 to 1,098,000 inhabitants (including suburbs), and now has a metropolitan population of approximately 14.6 million.\n\nHistorically, Calcutta was the centre of activity in the early stages of the national movement of independence. Exactly a hundred years after the fall of Bengal in the [[Battle of Plassey]], Calcutta saw the beginning of what is often called the First Independence Movement of India. It should be noted here that it is also just as often as not referred to as a War of Independence, and as one historian put it, \"The so called First National War of Independence was neither First, nor National, nor a War of Independence\". In the suburbs of Calcutta, at the [[Barrackpore]] military barracks, [[sepoy]] [[Mangal Pandey]] sparked off a huge revolt that shook the foundations of the British Empire. This movement is sometimes also called the [[Indian Mutiny]], although recent evidence goes against using this name and suggests \"The Revolt of 1857\" as a better and less controversial choice.\n\nIn 1883, [[Surendranath Banerjea]] organised a [[Indian National Association|national conference]] - the first of its kind in 19th century India. This conference heralded the birth of The [[Indian National Congress]]. The first native president of the [[Indian National Congress]] was Sir [[Womesh Chunder Bonnerjee]] and he was also the first Congress president to advocate self-rule by Indians, Sir [[Surendra Nath Banerjea]] (referred to by the British as \"Surrender Not\") were early eminent Calcuttans, who provoked and influenced nationalist thinking in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nOther societies based on nationalist or religious thoughts were started, like the [[Hindu Mela]]. Revolutionary organisations like the [[Jugantar]] and the [[Anushilan Samiti]] were formed with the goal of using force against the British rulers. Among early nationalist leaders, the most prominent were [[Sri Aurobindo]], Indira devi Chaudhurani, [[Bipin Chandra Pal]]. The early nationalists were inspired by [[Swami Vivekananda]], the foremost disciple of the [[Hindu]] mystic Sri [[Ramakrishna]] and helped by [[Sister Nivedita]], disciple of the former. The rousing cry that awakened India's soul was penned by [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]]. Now the national song of the nation, it is an ode to the land of [[Names of India#Bharat|Bharat]] (India) as the Divine Mother, \"[[Vande Mataram]].\"\n\nThe Elgin Road residence of [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] in Calcutta was the place from where he escaped the British to reach Germany during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He was the co-founder of the [[Indian National Army]] and the head of state of the [[Arzi Hukumate Azad Hind]], formed to counter and combat the [[British Raj]] in India. Renamed Netaji by poet laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]], he is regarded by many as perhaps the most prominent and influential freedom fighter in Indian history and is venerated in many Bengali households even today.\n\nMuslims were also involved in the nationalist movement, most notably Fazl Huq who from Calcutta in the 1930s attempted to organise a non-communal peasant party to agitate against the British and the wealthy Indian landowning class. The fact that many of the Hindus in this latter group were linked to the local Congress organisation and dominated the mainstream nationalist movement in Bengal from Calcutta led to attempts to thwart Huq's activities and fed into the tragic decline in communal relations that savaged Calcutta in 1946 and 1947 (see Kenneth McPherson, \"The Muslim Microcosm: the Muslims of Calcutta 1918-1935\", Steiner, Wiesbaden, 1973).\n\n[[File:Calcutta-slums-1986-IHS-40-02-Alley.jpeg|thumb|Slum in Calcutta, 1986]]\nThe intense violence caused during the [[partition of India]] led to a shift in demographics in Bengal, and especially Kolkata; large numbers of Muslims left for [[East Pakistan]], while hundreds of thousands of Hindus arrived to take their place. Kolkata received millions of refugees from what became East Pakistan without receiving substantial assistance from the central government.\n\nOver the 1960s and 1970s, severe power shortages, strife in labour relations (including strikes by workers and lockouts by employers) and a militant [[Maoism|Marxist-Maoist]] movement who sometimes used violence and property destruction as tactics of protest — the [[Naxalite]]s — damaged much of the city's infrastructure, leading to economic stagnation. (Ironically, this is the same city that has historically been a strong base of Indian communism: West Bengal was ruled by the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (CPI(M)) dominated [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] for nearly three decades — the world's longest-running democratically elected communist government.)\nIn 1971, the war between India and Pakistan led to another massive influx of refugees from the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), and their settling in Calcutta massively strained its already damaged infrastructure.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, [[Mumbai|Bombay]] overtook Calcutta as India's most populous city.\n\nCalcutta became plagued by power outages, labor unrest, disappearing industry, and violence from the [[Naxalite]] movement. In 1985 [[Rajiv Gandhi]] referred to Calcutta as a \"dying city\" because of the social and political traumas.\n\nThe city's economic recovery gathered momentum after [[economic reforms in India]] introduced by the central government in the mid-1990s. Since 2000, [[Information Technology]] (IT) services revitalized the city's stagnant economy. The city has also experienced a growth in the manufacturing sector. Following similar moves elsewhere in the country, the state government changed the city's official name from \"Calcutta\" to \"Kolkata\" in 2001.\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:History of Kolkata| ]]\n[[Category:History of West Bengal]]"}

The double form of the idiom is still found in parts of the American Southwest as \"Howdy, howdy\". Without regard to etymological beginnings, the word is used as a greeting such as \"Hello\" and not, normally, as an enquiry. As a result, it's not followed by a question mark. Punctuating \"Howdy\" commonly follows these rules:\n(i) If \"Howdy\" is used as a complete sentence, it's followed by an exclamation mark.\n(ii) If \"Howdy\" is the first word in a sentence, it's followed by a comma.\n\nIn the rural Southwestern United States, \"Howdy\" is a colloquial contraction of the formal greeting of \"How do you do?\", and as such is considered a formal and acceptable greeting for residents of that region of the world. \"Howdy\" is also the official greeting of Texas A&M University, though the two are not always automatically associated.\n\nThe word became recently popular in other areas of the world as it is the default greeting from the dashboard of WordPress, a very popular content management system. The probable reason for using \"Howdy\" (instead of \"Welcome\" or \"Hello\") in the dashboard is because Matt Mullenweg, one of the main developers of WordPress, was born and raised in Texas.\n\nThe phrase \"boy howdy\" is a development of the greeting which adds the exclamation \"boy\" to form an interjection which indicates an emphatic affirmation.\n\n\n"}

Ultimately, the only way to end the disruptions is to finish the game while enduring its resulting dangers with each succeeding move, after which everything is restored to normal outside of the players' memories.\n\nTwo children, Peter and Judy, find and play a game in which each roll of the dice brings the jungle from the game (as well as the creatures that live in it) to life around them. In order to reset the world around them, they must finish the game. Afterward, they get rid of the game which is found by their next-door neighbors, two young brothers.\n\nBrothers Danny and Walter, neighbors of Peter and Judy from the previous book, find Jumanji but ultimately choose not to play it. Instead, they find a similar game with a space theme, \"Zathura\", which they begin to play. As with Jumanji, playing Zathura brings elements of the game into reality, and in order to set everything back to normal, the boys must complete the game.\n\nTwo children find and play a magical board game. In doing so, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game.\n\nTwo young brothers are drawn into an intergalactic adventure when their house is hurled through the depths of space by the magical board game they are playing. Furthermore, the brothers surmise the only way to return home is to finish the game.\n\nThough there are no direct references in \"Zathura\" to the other films, and the movie's plot is completely self-contained, the studio marketed it as being set in the world of \"Jumanji\", and was thematically similar. The film is based on the children's book \"Zathura\", also written by Van Allsburg which was a sequel to the \"Jumanji\" source material.\n\nTwenty-one years after the events of the original film, the board game evolves into a video game. Four teenagers who are transported to the game's jungle setting and become the avatars of the characters they chose, and later discover another victim trapped in the game as well. The only way out is to complete the game, and in doing so, they each discover the best of themselves and win with a newfound heroism to see the challenge through. This film serves as a sequel to the 1995 film.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\", the film's cast discussed in interviews what a potential third \"Jumanji\" could be about. Karen Gillan also stated that an alternate ending left the door open for another movie, but that the scene was removed from the final cut of the film. In February 2018, it was announced that a third \"Jumanji\" film is in production with Kasdan returning to direct and Rosenberg and Pinkner returning to write the film, respectively. The stars of \"Welcome to the Jungle\" are expected to reprise their roles. The film is slated to be released December 13, 2019.\n\nAn animated television series inspired by the 1995 film ran for three seasons from 1996 to 1999.\n\nKey\n"}

It is a humorous romp through a medieval cosmos, including a send-up of Arthurian legend, and excursions to Heaven and Hell as in \"The Divine Comedy\". Cabell's work is recognized as a landmark in the creation of the comic fantasy novel, influencing Terry Pratchett and many others.\n\nThe eponymous hero, who considers himself a \"monstrous clever fellow,\" embarks on a journey through ever more fantastic realms in search of a parodized version of courtly love. Everywhere he goes he meets eccentric knights and damsels, in an acerbic satire of contemporary America. Jurgen gains the attention of the Lady of the Lake, Queen Guinevere, and even the Devil's wife.\n\nThe novel became more widely known after the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice attempted to bring a prosecution for obscenity. The printing plates were seized on January 4, 1920. The case went on for two years before Cabell and his publisher, Robert M. McBride, won. They argued that the \"indecencies\" were double entendres that also had perfectly decent interpretations, though it appeared that what had actually offended the prosecution most was the work's mocking expression of philosophy, including a jest about the nature of papal infallibility.\n\nIn 1922, Guy Holt his editor and publisher who was also named in the court case published \"Jurgen and the Law, A Statement. With Exhibits, including the Court's Opinion, and the brief for the Defendants on Motion to Direct an Acquittal\". There were only one thousand copies printed for sale. \n\nCabell took an author's revenge. The revised edition of 1923 included a previously \"lost\" passage in which the hero is placed on trial by the Philistines, with a large dung-beetle as the chief prosecutor. He also wrote a short book, \"Taboo\", in which he thanked John S. Sumner and the Society for the Suppression of Vice for generating the publicity that gave his career a boost.\n\nWriting in the \"Pacific Review\" in 1921, Vernon Louis Parrington praised \"Jurgen\", and described Cabell as \"one of the greatest masters of English prose.\" Aleister Crowley called \"Jurgen\" one of the \"epoch-making masterpieces of philosophy\" in 1929, - the book contains a parody of Crowley's Gnostic Mass. Crowley's famous phrase from \"The Book of the Law\", \"There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt\"—or its source, Rabelais's \"there was but this one clause to be observed, \"Do What Thou Wilt\"\"—is parodied as \"There is no law in Cocaigne save, Do that which seems good to you.\"\n\nReviewing Cabell's later novel, \"Hamlet Had An Uncle\", Basil Davenport called \"Jurgen\" \"a masterpiece.\"\n\nRobert A. Heinlein consciously patterned his best-known novel, \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", after \"Jurgen\", and Cabell's influence is also evident in the titles and themes of at least two other novels by Heinlein: his long-unpublished first novel, \"\" (written 1938, published 2003), and his late work \"\" (1984).\n\nFilmmaker Jürgen Vsych was named after \"Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice\", which was her father's favorite book.\n\n"}

Mainly, it is found in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Jordan, Egypt (\"kubbeh\", \"kebbah\", or \"koubeiba\"), Iraq, as well as Armenia (\"Keufteh\", \"ltsonvats\" ), Iran, Israel, Cyprus (\"koupa\", plural \"koupes\") and in Turkey it is called \"içli köfte\".\n\nIt is also found throughout Latin American countries which received substantial numbers of Levantine immigrants during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the region, the dish is particularly popular on the Caribbean coastline of Colombia and in Brazil.\n\nThe word is derived from the Classical Arabic \"kubbah\" (\"kibbeh\" in North Levantine Arabic), which means \"ball\". Various transliterations of the name are used in different countries: in English, \"kibbe\" and \"kibbeh\" and in Latin America, \"quibe\", quibbe, \"kibe\", or \"quipe\" (Argentina).\n\nIn Levantine cuisine, a variety of dishes made with bulghur (cracked wheat) and minced lamb are called \"kibbeh\". The northern Syrian city of Aleppo (Halab) is famous for having more than 17 different types. These include \"kibbeh\" prepared with sumac (\"kibbe sumāqiyye\"), yogurt (\"kibbe labaniyye\"), quince (\"kibbe safarjaliyye\"), lemon juice (\"kibbe ḥāmḍa\"), pomegranate sauce, cherry sauce, and other varieties, such as the \"disk\" \"kibbeh\" (\"kibbe arāṣ\"), the \"plate\" \"kibbeh\" (\"kibbe biṣfīḥa\" or \"kibbe bṣēniyye\") and the raw \"kibbeh\" (\"kibbeh nayyeh\").\n\n\"Kibbeh nayyeh\" is a raw dish made from a mixture of bulghur, very finely minced lamb or beef similar to steak tartare, and Middle Eastern spices, served on a platter, frequently as part of a \"meze\" in Lebanon and Syria, garnished with mint leaves and olive oil, and served with green onions or scallions, green hot peppers, and pita/pocket bread or \"markouk\" bread.\n\n\"Kubba Halab\" is an Iraqi version of kibbeh created with a rice crust and named after the largest city in Syria, Aleppo. \"Kubba Mosul\", also Iraqi, is flat and round like a disc. \"Kubbat Shorba\" is an Iraqi-Kurdish version prepared as a stew, commonly made with tomato sauce and spices. It is often served with \"arak\" and various salads. The Iraqi versions are part of the same versions eaten in Iran.\n\nA Syrian soup known as \"kubbi kishk\" consists of \"kubbi\" \"torpedoes\" or \"footballs\" in a yogurt (\"kishk\") and butter broth with stewed cabbage leaves. Another soup, known as \"kibbeh hamda\", consists of a chicken stock with vegetables (usually leeks, celery, turnips and courgettes), lemon juice and garlic, with small \"kibbeh\" made with ground rice as dumplings. In the Syrian Jewish diaspora this is popular both at Pesach and as the pre-fast meal on the day before Yom Kippur.\n\nOn Colombia's Carribean coast, the dish uses only ground beef and is frequently served in social occasions, often as a starter along with other regional delicacies, including Empanadas, Tequeños and Carimañolas.\n\n"}
{"id": "39703769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39703769", "title": "Lint (material)", "text": "Lint (material)\n\nLint is the common name for visible accumulations of textile fibers and other materials, usually found on and around clothing. Certain materials used in the manufacture of clothing, such as cotton, linen, and wool, contain numerous, very short fibers bundled together. During the course of normal wear, these fibers may either detach or be jostled out of the weave of which they are part. This is the reason that heavily used articles like shirts and towels become thin over time, and why these particles collect in the lint screen of a clothes dryer.\n\nBecause of their low surface area, static cling causes fibers that have detached from an article of clothing to continue to stick to one another and to that article or other surfaces with which they come in contact. Other small fibers or particles also accumulate with these clothing fibers, including human and animal hair and skin cells, plant fibers, and pollen, dust, and microorganisms.\n\nThe etymology of the modern word \"lint\" is related to \"linting\", the term used for the cultivation of the shorter fibers from the cotton plant (\"Gossypium\"), also called \"lint\", from which lower-quality cotton products are manufactured. Lint is composed of threads of all colors, which blend hues and may appear to be a uniform grey.\n\nDryer lint is lint generated by the drying of clothes in a clothes dryer; it typically accumulates on a dryer screen. Underwriters Laboratories recommends cleaning the lint filter after every cycle for safety and energy efficiency.\n\nNavel lint (also known by names such as navel fluff, belly button lint, belly button fluff, and dip lint) is an accumulation of fluffy fibers in the navel cavity. Many people find that, at the beginning and end of the day, a small lump of fluff has appeared in the navel cavity. This lint is an accumulation of cloth fibers that are scraped by body hair. The reasons for its accumulation in the navel are a subject of speculation. A likely hypothesis is that rubbing of navel hairs and clothing contributes to a build-up of static electricity, resulting in the collection of clothing fibers and to a lesser extent, dead skin cells.\n\nGeorg Steinhauser, a chemist writing in the journal \"Medical Hypotheses\", said that small pieces of fluff first form in the hair and then end up in the navel at the end of the day. He further said that abdominal hair often seems to grow in concentric circles around the navel; the scaly structure of the hair enhances the abrasion of minuscule fibres from the shirt and directs the lint towards the belly button. Steinhauser established that shaving one's belly will result in a fluff-free navel but only until the hairs grow back. His other suggestions include wearing old clothes, which tend to shed less lint than newer garments, which can lose up to one-thousandth of their weight to the belly button over the course of a year. A body piercing can also be used, with belly button rings particularly effective at sweeping away fibres before they lodge.\n\nPocket lint (also known as gnurr) is debris including bits of fabric as well as small shreds of paper and tissue that are often found in pockets. It may be caused by running the clothing through a washing machine one or more times, causing the pocket lining or contents to compact and shred.\n\nAs pocket lint is an amalgamation of the contents of the pockets, pocket lint can be helpful when determining whether drugs have been previously stored in the pockets, by testing it with various drug tests. In a survival situation, pocket lint can be used as tinder for starting a fire.\n\nThe Infocom game, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", was sold with a collection of \"props\" that included a small bag of \"pocket fluff\".\n\nInhalation of excessive amounts of lint, as observed in early textile workers, may lead to diseases of the lungs, such as byssinosis. Lint shed from clothing during the course of wear may also carry bacteria and viruses. For this reason, the presence of lint presents a danger during surgery, when it might carry microorganisms into open wounds. It has been demonstrated that due to the abrasive contact between clothing and skin, \"a person wearing a standard cotton scrub suit actually sheds more bacteria than without clothing\". Lint presents a threat to the environment in spaces that generally do not experience human contact, constituting \"one of the primary polluters\" in cave exploration.\n\nLint contamination also presents what may be the most serious threat of damage to delicate mechanical devices. In order to prevent lint contamination, workers entering clean rooms are generally required to wear an outer layer of clothing made from artificial fibers that are longer and thicker, and therefore much less likely to shed any material. Lint-resistant clothing materials include elastic fabrics like spandex (or Lycra), for which the fibers will tend to stretch rather than break, and longer, stronger non-woven polyolefin fibers.\n\nLint on clothing is generally considered unattractive and unprofessional. Furthermore, lint may be abrasive and may damage the clothing itself. For these reasons, visible lint is often removed with a lint remover or clothes brush. The accumulation of lint during clothes cleaning can be reduced with the use of a fabric softener, which reduces the amount of static electricity on clothing surfaces and therefore prevents the lint from sticking to the clothes.\n\nDryer lint, which collects on the lint screen of a clothes dryer, is highly flammable and therefore presents a fire hazard. However, because of this flammability, dryer lint may be collected for use as tinder, although burning man-made fibres can produce toxic fumes.\n\nIt is possible to compost lint retrieved from the lint screen on a dryer by adding it to other materials being composted. The texture of the material allows the organic matter within it to compost quickly and easily, but depending on the source, it may include inorganic fibers and materials which never break down.\n\nLint is useful to examine in forensic science because it is accumulated over time, and because the fibers shed from clothing adhere to not only that clothing, but also other particles to which the carrier is exposed. The lint on a person's clothing is therefore likely to contain material transferred from the various environments through which that person has passed, enabling forensic examiners to collect and examine lint to determine the movements and activities of the wearer. Examiners may use various chemicals to isolate lint fibers from different articles of clothing based on differences in color and other characteristics.\n\nAs noted above, dryer lint burns readily. Although this may present a hazard in the household, it also means that lint makes excellent tinder for starting fires. It is especially useful for catching sparks from flint and steel, or similar striker-type fire starters in the absence of matches.\n\nLint was used as a form of wound treatment for cuts and sores as early as 1500 BC and as recently as the American Civil War. Lint used specifically for treating wounds was sometimes referred to as \"charpie\".\n\n\n"}

For this reason, memorial services have an air of penitence about them. They tend to be served more frequently during the four fasting seasons.\n\nIf the service is for an individual, it is often held at the deceased's graveside. If it is a general commemoration of all the departed, or if the individual's grave is not close by, the service is held in a church, in front of a special small, free-standing \"memorial table\", to which is attached an upright crucifix and with a candelabra for the faithful to put lighted candles.\n\nThe deacon (or, if there is no deacon, the priest) swings the censer throughout almost the entire service, while all stand holding lighted candles. Near the end of the service, during the final troparia, all, either extinguish their candles, or place them in a candle holder by the memorial table. Each candle symbolizes the individual soul, which, as it were, each person holds in his own hand. The extinguishing (or giving up) of the candle, at the end of the service, symbolizes the fact that each person will have to surrender his soul, at the end of his life. \n\nThe service is composed of Psalms, ektenias (litanies), hymns and prayers. In its outline it follows the general order of Matins and is, in effect, a truncated funeral service. Some of the most notable portions of the service are the Kontakion of the Departed and the final singing of \"Memory Eternal\" (Slavonic: \"Vyechnaya Pamyat\").\n\nThe memorial service is most frequently served at the end of the Divine Liturgy; however, it may also be served after Vespers, Matins, or as a separate service by itself. If the service is held separately, there are readings from the Pauline epistles and the Gospels, which are assigned by the day of the week; no readings, however, are assigned to Sunday because Sunday should emphasize the resurrection of Christ rather than the departed.\n\nFor the memorial service, koliva (a ritual food of boiled wheat) is often prepared and is placed in front of the memorial table or an icon of Christ. Afterwards, it is blessed by the priest, who sprinkles it with holy water. The koliva is then taken to the refectory and is served to all those who attended the service.\n\nAfter an Orthodox Christian dies there are special \"Prayers for the Departure of the Soul\" that are said by the priest. Then the family or friends of the departed will wash and dress the body and it is placed in the casket after which a special expanded memorial service called the First Panikhida is celebrated, following which the reading of the Psalter commences and continues uninterrupted until the funeral. \n\nTraditionally, in addition to the service on the day of death, the memorial service is performed at the request of the relatives of an individual departed person on the following occasions:\n\nIt is also served on the numerous Soul Saturdays throughout the year. On these days, not only is the memorial service served, but there are also special propers at Vespers, Matins, and the Divine Liturgy. These days of general memorials are:\n\nthe celebration of memorial services is forbidden from Holy Thursday through Bright Week and on all Sundays throughout the year.\n\nA very abbreviated form of the memorial service is called the \"Lity\" (or \"Liti\" or \"Litia\"), from the Greek λιτὴ τελετή, \"litē teletē\", i.e. a plain ceremony, or λιτὸν μνημόσυνον, \"liton mnēmosynon\", i.e. a plain mnemosynon; it consists only of the concluding portion of the regular memorial service. This is often celebrated in the narthex of the church on ordinary weekdays (i.e., when there is no higher-ranking feast day), especially during Great Lent.\n\nThe Romanian 2016 film \"Sieranevada\" features a \"parastas\" in a Bucharest apartment with documentary precision.\nWhile the priest arrives, the family argues about several issues.\nThe priest and his aides finally arrive, they sing and bless the home and the food that will be distributed as alms.\nA Wallachian ritual involving a suit is also a plot element.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57049891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57049891", "title": "Mock language", "text": "Mock language\n\nMock language is a term in linguistic anthropology for the intentional use of a language not spoken by or native to the speaker that is used to reinforce the speaker's language ideology of the hegemonic language.\n\nWhen talking, the speaker includes words or phrases from other languages that they think fit into the conversation. The term \"Mock Spanish\" was popularized in the 1990s by Jane H. Hill, a linguist at the University of Arizona, mock Spanish is the most common form of mock language in the southwestern United States, where Hill first researched the phenomenon. The term \"Mock\" has since been applied to other languages, and the umbrella term \"Mock language\" developed. Mock language is commonly viewed as a form of appropriation. In the United States, the most common form is mock Spanish. However, globally, mock language is used to share meaning between the speaker and audience about the speech community the speaker is mocking.\n\nThe speaker is unintentionally indexing a language ideology that all Americans should speak English or that other languages are secondary in the US. Using words outside the speaker's native language neglects context of the conversion, meaning of the word or phrase, or conceptual knowledge including historical injustices to the borrowed language, culture, and physical surroundings. It is a borrowing words in different languages and using it in your context.\n\nWhen using mock language, the speaker is showing their 'cosmopolitanism' or global knowledge. One dominant language ideology is that English should be the only language spoken in the United States, establishing English as a hegemonic language. This hegemony creates a dominance of the hegemonic group over the ones that have not conformed. Mock language reinforces this, as it takes language and culture out of context to show the speaker's worldly knowledge, but does not celebrate or intellectually use the language. This ideology is actually maintaining the subordinate status of the other languages used as the language speakers in that community are expected to speak English and not in a mocking way.\n\nFor the opposing perspective, saying that using other languages in an English conversation is supportive of that language, it does not show awareness of the cultural or social meanings behind the words spoken. \nThe term \"Mock Spanish\" was popularized in the 1990s by linguistic anthropologist Jane H. Hill. This led to other languages being referred to as \"Mock-Languages.\" Increasing globalization in modern history has contributed significantly to the spreading and study of Mock-Language in linguistic anthropology. Globalization has occurred at an exponential rate through numerous media—such as television and social networking applications—during the turn of the 21st century. With globalization, more languages are being encountered in daily interactions, and more people are able to travel. To show this global perspective, it is common to incorporate words of different languages into your native language, thus mock language.\n\nHill analyzes the 'inner sphere' and 'outer spheres' in which Puerto Ricans living in New York uses their bilingualism. In the inner sphere of neighborhood and intimates such as family and close friends, the boundaries between English and Spanish are blurred formally and functionally. However, in the outer sphere with strangers or government officials, the usage of Spanish becomes marked and \"sharply objectified\" to the point where the boundaries are so distinct that bilingual speakers may become too scared to speak at all. This shows the hegemonic power of English and how Spanish speakers feel vulnerable and powerless to use Spanish. The need for perfect English is absolute, yet when English speakers dabble in Spanish in this mocking way, there is no nervousness, as their agency extends beyond English hegemony and into the power an English speaker holds in American society. Hill also discusses how semantic domains index a state. Saying something is \"el cheapo\" indexes that Spanish speakers do not have money or commonly buy cheap, crappy goods.\n\nIn a more recent study of Mock White Girl, researcher Tyanna Slobe explains how it is a hegemonic representation of a language being dominated than another and how people would to try to identify with that race by saying a combination of words in that language. “...complicating the moralizing gaze with which linguists have approached mock as uniformly reproducing white supremacist ideologies.” This is the performance piece that people want others to portray themselves to why they would speak this way.\n\nMock white girl shows how the intentional use of vocal fry to convey a mockery of the white, upper-class, suburban, spoiled young adult or teenager is conveying a shared meaning that the language the speaker is mocking is subordinate and not to be taken seriously. It indexes the characteristics of a stereotypical white girl and uses the n+1 level of indexicality for the public to make the connection between the mockery and the speech community.\n\nAnother semantic domain is language crossing. “Language crossing involves code alternation by people who are not accepted members of the group associated with the second language that they are using (code switching into varieties that are not generally thought to belong to them). This kind of switching involves a distinct sense of movement across social or ethnic boundaries and it raises issues of legitimacy which, in one way or another, participants need to negotiate in the course of their encounter.” This is similar to mock language as the people code alternating are not members of the group, similar to how mock-language speakers are English speakers not members of the language they are mocking.\n\nMock language is used in anthropology and linguistics to interpret different languages in a conversation and the characteristics of borrowing words from a language. It is important to study mock language in order to preserve the original foundations of languages or dialects that have become subject to the pressure of globalization. Each time a mock phrase is used, it reinforces the divergence from the original language. Globalization occurs at a much faster rate today than in the past, largely due to technological advancements that connect the world with no regard for national borders. American culture is overwhelmingly dominant in the field of online media, and American interpretations of other cultures often become somewhat of a universal standard, at least in terms of exposure. This makes it important for linguists to analyze such interpretations and recognize their origins.\n\nThe study of Mock Language also reveals several powerful racial ideologies in the way English speakers hold agency to use other languages carelessly. “It is certainly useful to think of linguistic signs as being bound to historical contexts. But a limited historical view of language fails to address the fact that speakers are often not aware of the historical references they make by using particular signs.” This leads to a general ignorance, mostly from the perspective of English speakers, regarding the use of certain phrases. Misuses of certain words can eventually be attributed to legitimate cultures after overuse, especially with the help of modern media as a medium of exposure, undermining history and often introducing the possibility of offending native speakers.\n\nIn the United States, the dominant language ideology is that English should be the official language. Racial minorities are treated adversely than whites, and their languages are not perceived as “American”. There are many social, economic, environmental disadvantages of minority groups. The dominant ideology does not allow these groups to celebrate their language, yet “mock language involves borrowings and wordplay by speakers who require little comprehension of the other language.” Mock language reinforces the status and social differences of native English speakers versus minorities and ethnic communities.\n\nWhile not every use of mock language is the same, aspects such as gendered indicators, greetings, and pronouns are commonly used. It may come about without the intention of knowing the harm for that language's speech community. Mock Spanish commonly uses gendered pronouns of 'el', 'la', and adds '-o' to the end of words.\n\nMock-white girl is a type of mock language that is inspired by the stereotypical \"white girl's\" vernacular. It commonly uses features such as 'like' in excess to imply the speaker is not well spoken or articulate. It also features uptalk, creaky voice, blondness and the stereotypical association with Starbucks.\n\nMock-Hindi has taken the word 'namaste' out of context singularly and does not borrow other words or linguistic features from the language. While these are all very different mock languages features, they all do not respect the original languages and highlight the language ideology of English dominance in the US. Additionally, it does not code switch between the two languages, a linguistic term for switching between two languages the speaker knows, as the speaker clearly does not know Hindi when using it in such a context. \nIt has been adapted in society for people to code switch between languages but there is a boundary where \"speaking\" the language is inauthentic and distasteful. People tend to say \"el\" or add an \"o\" at the end of words as if they are speaking mock Spanish such as el cheapo, no problemo. The semantic domain is cheapness and it suggests that Spanish speakers have a limited amount of money and like to get things that are lower quality and low-priced.\n\n“Mock Spanish relies upon the semiotic construction of two basic social types: the easygoing, humorous, and somewhat cosmopolitan white person and the lazy, dirty, sexually “loose,” and unintelligent Spanish speaker.” \n\nPopular T-shirts for young women with the saying \"namaste in bed\". This borrows the traditional greeting from Hindi and makes it into a pun of the slang term \"imma stay in bed\". It also associates the Hindi word as a yoga term, though this is misappropriation as it is a term used for greeting, not concluding a yoga session. It is in relation to being lazy.\n\nCinco de Mayo, a holiday that celebrates Mexico’s defeat of the French on May 5, 1862, has become extremely popular in the United States as a celebration based largely on the consumption of alcohol. Due to this association, the term “Cinco de Drinko” has emerged, representing both ignorance toward the holiday’s history and an example of the “add ‘o’” phenomenon. The “add ‘o’” phenomenon is the practice of English speakers adding an “o” to the end of an English word in order to give it the false appeal of being a Spanish word.\n\nYouTuber “Sprinkle of Glitter” would open videos until 2017 saying “Aloha Sprinklerinos”. While not only making up a word for the name of her follower base, she used mock Hawaiian; dropping in what she perceived as a fun, innocent greeting without knowing anything about Hawaiian language, culture, context in which Hawaiians say and use the word aloha, and historical inequalities facing Hawaiians.\n\n\"Mock White Girl\" is a common example that is seen in movies where the girls are speaking in standard English with creaky voice and are trying to be portrayed as privileged, popular, and in power. In the 2004 film \"Mean Girls,\" character Regina George is known to be the most popular girl in school and throughout the movie she has the voice for people to recognize her status.\nBars and pubs around the world have signs that try to imitate European bar and pub culture. Oftentimes, German is incorporated due to the association of German culture with drinking. This decontextualization and use of stereotype is mock language. Danke is German for \"thank you\", but it is decontextualized in an English-speaking environment.\n\nThe signs are using German as an international language of beer or drinking, but \"das boot\" in German translates as “the boat” and has nothing to do with shoes or drinking. Nevertheless, it is used as the name of a drink represented by footwear. Using 'danke' in a pub may show knowledge of a direct translation, however it stereotypes drinking beer with German culture and language.\n"}

It has also been adopted to describe non-theological disputes of a rancorous nature.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill, discussing the fallibility of the moral consensus in his essay \"On Liberty\" (1859) refers scornfully to the \"odium theologicum\", saying that, in a sincere bigot, it is one of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling. In this essay, he takes issue with those who rely on moral feeling rather than reasoned argument to justify their beliefs.\n\nThe early linguist Leonard Bloomfield believed it necessary to develop linguistics as a cumulative, non-personal discipline; as a \"genuine\" science. In a talk in 1946, speaking of the development of the American Linguistics Society, he stated the fostering of such a discipline had saved it \"from the blight of the \"odium theologicum\" and the postulation of schools . . . denouncing all persons who disagree or who choose to talk about something else,\" and he added \"The struggle with recalcitrant facts, unyielding in their complexity, trains everyone who works actively in science to be humble, and accustoms him to impersonal acknowledgement of error.\"\n\nPhilosopher and historian of science Thomas Samuel Kuhn argued that scientists are strongly committed to their beliefs, theories and methods (the collection of which he termed \"paradigms\"), and that science progresses mainly by paradigm shifts. He claimed that scientists with conflicting paradigms will hold to them as dearly as theologians hold to their theological paradigms. Philosopher of math and science Imre Lakatos, a student of Karl Popper, described the nature of science in a similar manner. \n\nAccording to Lakatos, science progresses by continual modification or else supersession of what he termed \"research programs\" (roughly equivalent to Kuhn's \"paradigms\"). Lakatos claimed that a research program is informed by metaphysical beliefs as well as observation of facts, and may infinitely resist falsification if a scientist wishes to continue holding it in spite of problems or the discovery of new evidence. If this view is correct, science does not remedy \"odium theologicum\", it provides another field in which it may manifest. \n\nIn the controversy over the validity of fluxions the philosopher George Berkeley addressed his Newtonian opponent:\n\nWhatever view of science and the sociology of scientific knowledge is correct, it is a fact that in the history of science there have been many instances of new theories (e.g., germ theory of disease, finitude of the speed of light, radioactivity) being ridiculed and shunned by the greater scientific community when first proposed or discovered, only later to be adopted as more probably accurate.\n\n\n"}

Themes that the school has delt with include Neo-Marxism, Yugoslavism, psychoanalysis, Third wave feminism, Crisis theory, Post-Colonialism, Historical revisionism, Post-fascism, social constructionism, revolutionary democracy, linguistic nationalism and philosophy of existence. The school has a festival format and is organized once a year in December. It nurtures the traditions of the Praxis School - a Yugoslav Marxist humanist philosophical movement, whose members were influenced by Western Marxism and organized the Korčula Summer School. The Open University of Sarajevo was an outspoken advocate of the 2014 Bosnia and Herzegovina social riots and called for the continuation of direct democracy that was established by plenums during and subsequently after the riots. The school runs a Free-to-view platform that streams all of its content online, dubbed in various languages, and archives it on its website and Youtube channel. The organizers negate the term \"school\", preferring to use the term \"platform\".\n\nThe Open University of Sarajevo was founded in 2011 by a select group of leftist professors from the University of Sarajevo in cooperation with the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, the Youth Initiative for Human Rights, the \"Crvena\" art and culture association, the Pantheon-Sorbonne University and the Krokodil Literary Festival. The initial group of founders included prof. Dr. Asim Mujkić from the Faculty of Philosophy, prof. Dr. Enver Kazaz from the Comparative Literature Departement of the Faculty of Philosophy and prof. Dr. Dino Abazović from the Faculty of Political Sciences. Furthermore, the founding committee was joined by numerous other public intellectuals from the Former Yugoslavia, including Sarajevo-born writer and scholar Igor Štiks, award-winning Bosnian film director Jasmila Žbanić, Croatian linguist Snježana Kordić and others. The first edition of the school was held from 12 to 15 December 2011 in smaller venues, emulating the leftist café tradition of the 1960s, before Nihad Kreševljaković, the director of the Sarajevo War Theatre and grandson of Bosnian historian Hamdija Kreševljaković indirectly joined the project and brought it to his theatre two years later. In 2013 the school established the Center for Interactive Education and Social Action (CODA) with the goal of improving democratic values and promoting social, economic and political participation and emancipation in Bosnian society. The 2015 edition was the first to include a wider multimedia program and a theatrical performance directed by Serbian experimental theatre director Bojan Đorđev titled \"Nije to crvena, to je krv\" (That's not red, that's blood). \n\nThe school is organized every December and lasts for four days. Each year's program is formed around a particular question such as \"What are we afraid of?\", subsequently forming topics based on said statement (\"Why are we afraid of...Yugoslavism?\"; \"Why are we afraid of...Marxism?\"; \"Why are we afraid of...immigrants?\" etc.) Events and lectures are held in three venues, with the main stage being the Sarajevo War Theatre. The other two venues are the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Each day's events are organized sequentially starting from the morning. The school follows an interactive and multimedia format with theatre plays, film projections, poetry readings and interactive games being held. The theatre segments often follow the form of Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed, and are directed by notable theatre directors from the Former Yugoslavia. Each day's activities are concluded in the Sarajevo War Theatre where the main round table discussions, lectures, panels and Q&A's are held. An evening symposium tops off the day. Another major aspect of the school's format is the fact that it does not require enrollment or any form of participant registration, instead opting for a grassroots and plenum format. \n\n"}
{"id": "51543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51543", "title": "Phonetic complement", "text": "Phonetic complement\n\nA phonetic complement is a phonetic symbol used to disambiguate word characters (logograms) that have multiple readings, in mixed logographic-phonetic scripts such as Egyptian hieroglyphs, Akkadian cuneiform, Japanese, and Mayan. Often they reenforce the communication of the ideogram by repeating the first or last syllable in the term.\n\nWritten English has few logograms, primarily numerals, and therefore few phonetic complements. An example is the \"nd\" of \"2nd\" 'second', which avoids ambiguity with 2 standing for the word 'two'. In addition to numerals, other examples include Xmas, Xianity, and Xing for Christmas, Christianity, and Crossing – note the separate readings \"Christ\" and \"Cross\".\n\nIn Sumerian, the single word \"kur\" had two meanings: 'hill' and 'country'. Akkadian, however, had separate words for these two meanings: \"šadú\" 'hill' and \"mātu\" 'country'. When Sumerian cuneiform was adapted for writing Akkadian, this was ambiguous because both words were written with the same character (conventionally transcribed KUR, after its Sumerian pronunciation). To alert the reader as to which Akkadian word was intended, the phonetic complement \"-ú\" was written after KUR if hill was intended, so that the characters KUR-ú were pronounced \"šadú,\" whereas KUR without a phonetic complement was understood to mean \"mātu\" 'country'.\n\nPhonetic complements also indicated the Akkadian nominative and genitive cases. Similarly, Hittite cuneiform occasionally uses phonetic complements to attach Hittite case endings to Sumerograms and Akkadograms. \n\nPhonetic complements should not be confused with determinatives (which were also used to disambiguate) since determinatives were used specifically to indicate the category of the word they preceded or followed. For example, the sign DINGIR often precedes names of gods, as LUGAL does for kings. It is believed that determinatives were not pronounced. \n\nAs in Akkadian, Japanese borrowed a logographic script, Chinese, designed for a very different language. The Chinese phonetic components built into these \"kanji\" do not work when they are pronounced in Japanese, and there is not a one-to-one relationship between them and the Japanese words they represent. \n\nFor example, the kanji 生, pronounced \"shō\" or \"sei\" in borrowed Chinese vocabulary, stands for several native Japanese words as well. When these words have inflectional endings (verbs/adjectives and adverbs), the end of the stem is written phonetically:\nas well as the hybrid Chinese-Japanese word\nNote that some of these verbs share a kanji reading (\"i,\" \"u,\" and \"ha\"), and okurigana are conventionally picked to maximize these sharings.\n\nThese phonetic characters are called \"okurigana.\" They are used even when the inflection of the stem can be determined by a following inflectional suffix, so the primary function of \"okurigana\" for many kanji is that of a phonetic complement. \n\nGenerally it is the final syllable containing the inflectional ending is written phonetically. However, in adjectival verbs ending in \"-shii,\" and in those verbs ending in \"-ru\" in which this syllable drops in derived nouns, the final two syllables are written phonetically. There are also irregularities. For example, the word \"umareru\" 'be born' is derived from \"umu\" 'to bear, to produce'. As such, it may be written 生まれる [生mareru], reflecting its derivation, or 生れる [生reru], as with other verbs ending in elidable \"ru.\"\n\nChinese never developed a system of purely phonetic characters. Instead, about 90% of Chinese characters are compounds of a determinative (called a 'radical'), which may not exist independently, and a phonetic complement indicates the approximate pronunciation of the morpheme. However, the phonetic element is basic, and these might be better thought of as characters used for multiple near homonyms, the identity of which is constrained by the determiner. Due to sound changes over the last several millennia, the phonetic complements are not a reliable guide to pronunciation.\n\nThe Maya Script, the logosyllabic orthography of the Maya Civilization, used phonetic complements extensively and phonetic complements could be used synharmonically or disharmonically. The former is exemplified by the placement of the syllabogram for \"ma\" underneath the logogram for \"Jaguar\" (in Classic Maya, \"BALAM\"): thus, though pronounced \"BALAM\", the word for \"jaguar\" was spelled \"BALAM-m(a)\". Disharmonic spellings also existed in the Maya Script.\n\n"}

The term comes from journalist Michael Kinsley, who said, \"A gaffe is when a politician tells the truth – some obvious truth he isn't supposed to say.\"\n\nThe term gaffe may be used to describe an inadvertent statement by a politician that the politician believes is true while the politician has not fully analyzed the consequences of publicly stating it. Another definition is a statement made when the politician privately believes it to be true, realizes the dire consequences of saying it, and yet inadvertently utters, in public, the unutterable. Another definition is a politician's statement of what is on his or her mindthis may or may not be inadvertentthereby leading to a ritualized 'gaffe dance' between candidates. While exhibiting umbrage or shock, and playing on the mistake, the 'offended candidate' must not exhibit anything resembling glee. A propensity to concentrate on so-called 'gaffes' in campaigns has been criticized as a journalistic device that can lead to distraction from real issues. The Kinsley gaffe is said to be a species of the general 'political gaffe.'\n\nKinsley himself posed the question: \"Why should something a politician says by accident automatically be taken as a better sign of his or her real thinking than something he or she says on purpose?\"\n\nSteven Pinker says that politicians use vague and indirect language to avoid making concrete statements, and that lazy journalists base political coverage around \"gaffe spotting\" rather than analysis of political platforms.\n\nThe rise of Internet activism has created a new generation of negative campaigning where a political campaign can create attack ads within an hour of a politician making a gaffe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29963204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29963204", "title": "Portrayal of Native Americans in film", "text": "Portrayal of Native Americans in film\n\nThe portrayal of Native Americans in film has been fed by stereotypes, which has raised allegations of racism. Traditionally, the Native American archetype has been that of a violent, uncivilized villain, juxtaposed next to the archetypal hero: the virtuous, white Anglo-Saxon settler. However, a growing number of pictures in the latter half of the twentieth century and beyond have portrayed indigenous peoples of the Americas in a more historically accurate light.\n\n\"Peter Pan\" is a Disney film involving Native Americans. A major scene in \"Peter Pan\" involves the Lost Boys and Peter Pan celebrating at the Native Americans' camp after Peter rescues Tiger Lily, the daughter of the chief, from Captain Hook. While they are there they sing \"What Makes the Red Man Red?\"\n\n\"Pocahontas\" is another Disney film that portrays Native Americans. The film focuses on the European's voyage to the Americas in search of gold. When they arrive, they come across a Native American tribe that is already living on that land. There is conflict between the two groups, both hating the other. The Europeans want gold and the Native Americans want their land and their livelihoods. Just before a battle between the two groups begins, Pocahontas, a young Native American woman, saves the life of a European man, and prevents the war from happening. Pocahontas portrays Native Americans and Europeans with just as much guile. One scene involves both the Europeans and the Native Americans singing \"Savages\" about the other group.\n\nTraditionally, Native Americans have been portrayed as the uncivilized villains in film. According to Beverly R. Singer, \"Despite the fact that a diversity of indigenous peoples had a legal and historical significance in the formation of every new country founded in the western hemisphere, in the United States and Canada the term 'Indians' became a hegemonic designation implying that they were all the same in regards to culture, behavior, language, and social organization. The view of 'Indians' as savage and uncivilized was repeated in early films and crystallized the image of 'Indians' as dangerous and unacceptable to the normative lives of European immigrants whose lives appeared in films to be more valuable than those of the indigenous people they were colonizing.\"\n\nIn most films involving Native Americans, they wear clothes made from animal skins, carry spears, and enjoy fighting with most strangers who come into their land. The warriors fight with arrowhead knives and brute strength. The settlers carry guns and weapons with them wherever they go in self-defense.\n\nIt is known from Lewis and Clark's diaries that Sacajawea was a key player in their explorations. However, Hollywood has trivialized her importance. The film \"Far Horizons\" is a fictionalized account of Sacajawea, played by Donna Reed, about the Lewis and Clark expedition. It is known that she was a strong, independent, and intelligent woman. However, Hollywood portrays Sacajawea's life centered on a love story with Clark, played by Charlton Heston. In the film, Sacajawea and Clark realize that they can never fulfill their love and be together because of racial prejudices and Clark's prominent position in white society. Sacajawea finally makes the ultimate sacrifice and returns alone to her tribe while Clark returns to white society and his white fiancée. There are in fact no records of a romantic relationship between Sacajawea and Clark.\n\nIn the sequel to Disney's \"Pocahontas\", \"\", the first time Pocahontas sets foot on English soil, she is dressed in her revealing one-strap dress, while Englishmen and Englishwomen look at her with disdain and disgust while she admires everything London has to offer. She is unconsciously compared to a wild animal running amok. It is a classic scene of the inferior Native American woman doting over her white-European surrounding while Europeans view her as an excited savage enamored by their world.\nLiterary artists found various ways of dealing with the \"culturally troublesome conclusion\" that the story of Pocahontas presents (Tilton, 59). The way many artists dealt with the troublesome conclusions, though, was to change aspects of the story. Therefore, authors are continually producing their own works, but they are not original or based on solely history or fantasy. The mix of history and creativity of a story rooted in historical falsity serves to perpetuate stereotypes beyond intention. This becomes harmful when multiple detrimental intentions become more and more intertwined into the American narrative, and harder to tease out from accuracy.\n[Tilton, Robert S. Pocahontas: The Evolution of an American Narrative. New York: Cambridge UP, 1994. Print.]\n\nThe first film to feature Native American actors was \"An Indian Love Story\", in 1911. The film was also designed to provide an authentic background showing the way of life of Native Americans and their communities.\n\nIn some films, Native Americans are viewed as intelligent and spiritual. They are the innocent victims of what the white settlers are doing to them. One example of this can be found in the movie \"Dances with Wolves\". One scene shows the U.S. soldiers capturing the protagonist of the film, John Dunbar, and taking him as a prisoner away from his Native American land. Out of nowhere, the Native Americans race onto the scene and kill all of the U.S. soldiers while none of the Native Americans get killed. Some of them receive injuries, but they just ignore the pain and do not seem to even realize that they have been hurt. They are portrayed as being strong and immune to the pain.\n\nThe final credits of the film explain what happens after the movie. It describes the history of the Sioux people after the film takes place:\n\n\"Thirteen years later, their homes destroyed, their buffalo gone, the last band of free Sioux submitted to white authority at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. The great horse culture of the plains was gone and the American frontier was soon to pass into history.\"\n\nThe film \"The New World\" is another movie about Native Americans. It is the quasi-fictitious story of Pocahontas and John Smith. John Smith arrives with the European settlers and gets captured by a Native American tribe. While there, Smith is accepted by the Native Americans and falls in love with one of the young women, Pocahontas. When he is describing the Native American tribe he explains that, \"They are gentle, loving, faithful, lacking in all guile and trickery. The words denoting lying, deceit, greed, envy, slander, and forgiveness have never been heard. They have no jealousy, or sense of possession.\" The Native Americans portrayed in this film were peaceful and gentle people. They were not evil; they were just different from the white settlers.\n\n"}

Near the end of the nineteenth century there were changes in societal views towards ready-made garments: They were no longer seen as only for the lower classes but also for the middle classes. This trend started in the United States. In the beginning they were more popular with men than women. In the late 1860s, twenty-five percent of garments produced in the US were ready-made, but by 1890, the portion had risen to sixty percent.

{"id": "3276445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3276445", "title": "Self-disclosure", "text": "Self-disclosure\n\nSelf-disclosure is a process of communication by which one person reveals information about himself or herself to another. The information can be descriptive or evaluative, and can include thoughts, feelings, aspirations, goals, failures, successes, fears, and dreams, as well as one's likes, dislikes, and favorites.\n\nSocial penetration theory posits that there are two dimensions to self-disclosure: breadth and depth. Both are crucial in developing a fully intimate relationship. The range of topics discussed by two individuals is the breadth of disclosure. The degree to which the information revealed is private or personal is the depth of that disclosure. It is easier for breadth to be expanded first in a relationship because of its more accessible features; it consists of outer layers of personality and everyday lives, such as occupations and preferences. Depth is more difficult to reach, and includes painful memories and more unusual traits that we might hesitate to share with others. We reveal ourselves most thoroughly and discuss the widest range of topics with our spouses and loved ones.\n\nSelf-disclosure is an important building block for intimacy and cannot be achieved without it. Reciprocal and appropriate self-disclosure is expected. Self-disclosure can be assessed by an analysis of cost and rewards which can be further explained by social exchange theory. Most self-disclosure occurs early in relational development, but more intimate self-disclosure occurs later.\n\nSocial penetration theory states that the development of a relationship is closely linked to systematic changes in communication. Relationships generally begin with the exchange of superficial information and gradually move on to more meaningful conversations. In order to develop a more intimate relationship, partners must increase the breadth and depth of their conversations. Breadth includes the variety of topics two people discuss and depth is the personal significance of these topics.\n\nAltman and Taylor use a wedge to explain this theory. In this example, the beginning of a relationship is represented by a narrow and shallow wedge because only a few topics are discussed. However, as the relationship goes on, the wedge should become broader and deeper, including more topics of personal significance. The wedge must drive through three \"layers\" in order for intimacy to develop. The first is superficial \"small talk\" with little personal information about the speakers. The next layer is intimate, with increasing breadth and depth and more personal details. The third is the very intimate level, where extremely private information is shared.\n\nIntimacy in these relationships can develop only if the persons involved reciprocate disclosures. Intimacy will not develop if only one partner discloses and the other continues to reveal only superficial information. Reciprocity must be gradual and match the intimacy of the other's disclosures. Too rapid, too personal disclosure creates an imbalance in a relationship that can be discomfiting. This gradual process varies from relationship to relationship and can depend on the specific partner with whom one is communicating.\n\nReciprocity is a positive response from the person with whom one is sharing information, whereby the person who received the disclosure self-discloses in turn. Self-disclosure usually influences whether two people will want to interact again. Research has shown that when one person self-discloses, another person is more likely to self-disclose. Initially, the process is started by one partner's reveal of personal information to the other partner. In return, the other will disclose something and behave in such a way so as to be responsive to the initial disclosure's content, while also conveying a degree of understanding and validation for what was revealed.\n\nResearch has found that people who consider themselves to be high in disclosure are likely to be good at eliciting more disclosure from those with whom they interact. Three theories describe reciprocity: The social attraction-trust hypothesis, social exchange theory and the norm of reciprocity. The social attraction-trust hypothesis says that people disclose to one another because they believe the person who disclosed to them likes and trusts them. Social exchange theory explains that people attempt to maintain equality in self-disclosure because an imbalance in this makes them uncomfortable. The third explanation, the norm of reciprocity, argues that reciprocating disclosure is a social norm and violating it makes a person uncomfortable.\n\nThere are two types of reciprocity: turn-taking reciprocity and extended reciprocity. Turn-taking is when partners immediately self-disclose with one another and extended is when disclosure happens over a period of time, in which one partner may be the only one disclosing while the other just listens. Those who engage in turn taking reciprocity are shown to like their interaction partners more than those who engage in extended reciprocity. Turn taking partners are also shown to feel closer and similar to each other and to enjoy the other's company more than extended pairs. This can be explained by the social attraction-trust hypothesis because the partners perceive the discloser as liking and trusting them because they disclosed personal information. Those who engage in extended reciprocity are affected by the social exchange theory and the norm of reciprocity which can account for the lower degree of liking. Since extended reciprocity limits reciprocating disclosure it creates an imbalance in disclosure which violates both of these theories. That said, people usually report that they themselves are disclosing more than is the other partner. This is called perceived partner reciprocity, and it is critical to the self-disclosure process in developing relationships.\n\nTwo key components for intimacy are disclosure and partner responsiveness. It is extremely important that when a speaker discloses personal information their partner also discloses something personally relevant. It is also essential that the listener understand, validate and care about what the speaker is disclosing. If the speaker does not feel accepted by the listener then they may not disclose something to them in the future, which stops the development of intimacy. Emotional disclosures are also shown to foster intimacy more than factual disclosures. Factual disclosures reveal facts and information about the self (e.g., \"I am divorced from my husband.\") while emotional disclosures reveal a person's feelings, thoughts and judgments (e.g., \"My divorce was so painful it has made it difficult for me to trust a romantic partner again\"). Emotional disclosures can increase intimacy because they allow the listener to confirm and support the discloser's self-view. The transition from sharing impersonal to personal facts is crucial to the building of an intimate relationship. One must feel accepted in order to feel comfortable enough to self-disclose. Without acceptance, one partner will withdraw and fail to reveal personal facts within the relationship. Sharing ourselves also brings us out of our imaginary worlds and allows us to see the realities of the world we live in. We are most comfortable sharing with those whom we like and feel like us. There is also evidence that someone who introduces himself with more intimacy is more likely to facilitate self-disclosure and intimacy with the recipient. Thus, self-disclosure breeds intimacy. This is why we reveal ourselves most and discuss the widest range of topics with our spouses and loved ones.\n\nWe often perceive our own self-disclosure as higher than our partner's, which can lead to ill feelings. It is hard for humans to accurately judge how fully another is disclosing to them.\n\nAccording to Snyder (1974) self-monitoring is the personality difference in individual's degree of preference to both self-expression and self-presentation.Self-monitoring is a form of impression management in which a person examines a situation and behaves accordingly. Although self-monitoring is measured on a continuous scale, researchers often group individuals into two types: high and low self-monitors. Someone who is a high self-monitor tends to examine a situation more closely and adjusts their behavior in order \"fit in\" with others in the scenario. High self-monitors tend to behave in a friendlier and extroverted manner in order to be well liked by peers. A low self-monitor does not do this and tends to follow their own emotions and thoughts when behaving in public. Since they are more attuned to social cues, high self-monitors are generally better at assessing the level of intimacy a partner is disclosing. By noticing these cues, high self-monitors tend to reciprocate equally in their self-disclosures.\n\nThis can be explained by the norm of reciprocity because the high self-monitors can pick up on these cues easily and know that they need to respond with their own disclosure. It can also be explained by social exchange theory. Research shows that high self-monitors are more uncomfortable when paired with a low self-monitor because low self-monitors do not tend to disclose intimate details so the balance in the conversation is uneven. High self-monitors are also shown to be the \"pace-setters\" of the conversation and generally initiate and maintain the flow of a conversation.\n\nThose in a positive mood have been found to disclose more intimately than those in a negative mood. This may be because of informational effects whereby happy people tend to access more positive information which leads them to behave in a more optimistic and confident manner. Unhappy people tend to access more negative information which increases the likelihood of cautious, pessimistic and restrained communications.\n\nThis may also be due to processing effects, in particular assimilation and accommodation effects. Assimilation effects rely on an individual's prior knowledge to guide their behavior in a situation and accommodation effects rely on careful monitoring of a situation and a greater attention to concrete information. Assimilative processing is ideal for safe, routine situations while accommodative processing is for problematic situations. Happy people tend to use assimilative processing, which leads to more daring and direct disclosures, while unhappy people use accommodative processing, which leads them to be more cautious in their disclosures. These accommodating effects for unhappy people tend to increase reciprocity because these individuals will match the level of disclosure from their partner but will not go beyond that.\n\nHowever, it can also be said that being distressed, anxious, or fearful (which would be classified as negative mood states) can accelerate disclosure as well. The exception to this is loneliness, for lonely individuals have shown decreased rates of self-disclosure.\n\nWhether or not one sex shares more readily is a heated debate in social psychology, but sex-role identities play a large part in the amount one chooses to reveal to another. Androgynous people disclose more intimately across contexts than do notably masculine and feminine people.\n\nResearch findings on gender differences in self-disclosure are mixed. Women self-disclose to enhance a relationship, while men self-disclose relative to their control and vulnerabilities. Men initially disclose more in heterosexual relationships. Women tend to put more emphasis on intimate communication with same-sex friends than men do.\n\nIn relationships, there are still other factors that contribute to the likelihood of disclosure. While people with high self-esteem tend to reveal themselves more, the reverse is also true, where self-esteem is enhanced by a partner's disclosures. In men, self-disclosure and the level of disclosure they perceive from their wives is positively correlated with their self-esteem. For both genders, the state of a relationship and the feelings associated with it are major contributors to how much each spouse reveals himself or herself. Husbands and wives in a relationship marked with satisfaction, love, and commitment rate their own levels of disclosure highly as well as their perceptions of their spouses' disclosures.\n\nBeing shy decreases self-disclosure. Among men, those who are or appear more \"tough\" are less likely to disclose and express themselves.\n\nMotivation for disclosure is also critical: does the individual need to present himself or herself in a certain way in order to gain certain benefits, and does the self-disclosure match the person's sense of ideal self? We like to present ourselves in ways that we feel are congruent with our own self-concepts, and what we tell others about ourselves often becomes how we actually are.\n\nSexual self-disclosure is the act of revealing one's sexual preferences to another, usually to one's sexual partner. This allows an even deeper level of understanding between two people and fosters even more intimacy as a result of the disclosures. Likewise, relationship satisfaction was found to correlate with sexual disclosures. For men, high levels of sexual self-disclosure predicted higher relationship satisfaction, though this was not found to be true for women. But, sexual satisfaction was linked to higher levels of sexual self-disclosure for both men and women. Further, those who disclose more sexually have been found to have less sexual dysfunction.\n\nSelf-disclosure is a method of relationship maintenance, aiming to keep partners satisfied with their relationship. Partners learn a shared communication system, and disclosures are a large part of building that system, which has been found to be very beneficial in highly satisfying relationships. Significant positive relationships have been found between multiple measures of relationship satisfaction and the levels of spouses' disclosure on the Social Penetration Scale. Further, affection and support are provided to most in the most important ways through marriage. Surveys done by a variety of researchers have found that people list marriage as the ultimate form of intimacy. Spouses feel responsible, in that they need to be responsive to their partners' self-disclosures, more so than they feel obligated to respond to the disclosures of people in their other relationships.\n\nIn a study by Laurenceau and colleagues, several differences were found in the satisfaction of spouses based on their daily-diary recordings of self-disclosures in their daily interactions. The results show that the actual disclosures in the process of self-disclosure may not be the only factors that facilitate intimacy in relationships. Husbands' intimacy was most strongly predicted by self-disclosure, while perceived responsiveness to disclosure was the stronger predictor for wives' feelings of intimacy with their husbands. A different study found evidence of wives' perceptions of their husbands' self-disclosures as being a strong predictor of how long a couple will stay together. Those who think their husbands are not sharing enough are likely to break up sooner. This finding links to the idea of positive illusions in relationship studies. For husbands, the actual act of self-disclosure is more indicative of their feelings of intimacy with their wives. On the other hand, wives are thought to value more the feelings of being understood and validated by their husbands' responsiveness to their disclosures, and this is the more important factor in their feelings of intimacy in their marriages.\n\nRelated to these findings, those husbands who reported the highest ratings of global marital satisfaction showed the highest ratings in daily intimacy. Similarly, the wives who rated their global satisfaction highest also had higher levels of daily intimacy. Greater marital satisfaction was found among those who had the higher ratings of intimacy. Further, couples with high levels of demand-withdraw communication rated their average daily intimacy as much lower. This suggests a relationship between one's overall marital satisfaction and the amount of intimacy in a relationship, though no causation can be proven with the present research. Self-esteem has also been found to be a predictor of satisfaction, with couples exhibiting both high self-esteem and high self-disclosure levels being the most satisfied in their relationships.\n\nMore disclosures of unpleasant feelings led to less marital satisfaction in recent studies, and disclosure is affected the minute a relationship is stressed, as feelings of less attachment to a spouse promote decreased self-disclosure. Likewise, less intimacy leads to more negative disclosures between partners. However, findings by Tolstedt and Stokes (1984) suggest that the depth of self-disclosure actually increases as the intimacy of a relationship decreases. The breadth of disclosure decreases with decreasing intimacy as originally predicted, but couples actually disclose more deeply. It is speculated that these results come about because a strained relationship causes spouses to restrict their topics of communication (breadth), but that they are also more willing to discuss deeply intimate subjects: the negative ones. Thus, while they are sharing more deeply, it is mostly in a negative light. The researchers then speculated that people might actually avoid disclosing very personal facts in the most satisfying relationships because they are fearful that their positive relationships will be negatively affected.\n\nAs time progresses, disclosure in marriage has been found to decrease, often around the time that spouses reach their 40's. It is suggested that at this stage partners know each other quite well and are very satisfied with what they communicate already.\n\nPeople first disclose facts then emotions and disclose mostly positive information in the early stages of a relationship. Some speculate that disclosures and their respective responses from a spouse lead to intimacy between the partners, and these exchanges accumulate into global and positive evaluations of the relationship by the couple. In support, studies show that couples who report greater levels of intimacy in self-reports of their daily interactions are also those who report increased global relationship functioning in their marriages. Further, the importance of disclosure in a relationship might change over time as it relates in different ways to various factors of a relationship, such as responsiveness and love, especially at the beginning of a relationship.\n\nDisclosure also changes as group size increases. As a group gets larger, people become less willing to disclose. Research has shown that individuals are more willing to disclose in groups of two than in larger groups and are more willing to disclose in a group of three rather than four. The actual disclosures mimic the willingness to disclose as individuals disclose more in pairs than they do in the larger groups. There are also gender differences in disclosure depending on group size. Men feel more inhibited in dyads, match the intimacy of the disclosure from their partner, and do not offer more information. Women, on the other hand, feel more inhibited in larger groups and disclose more personal information in dyads.\n\nNearly every school of thought is in agreement that self-disclosure is a necessary element of therapeutic technique. Self-disclosure by the therapist is often thought to facilitate increased disclosure by the client, which should result in increased understanding of the problem at hand. It helps to acknowledge the therapeutic relationship as a fundamental healing source, as an alliance between client and therapist is founded on self-disclosure from both parties. In some respects it is similar to modeling appropriate social behavior. Establishing common interests between therapists and clients is useful to maintain a degree of reality. Establishing such interests is especially beneficial in therapists' relationships with children, especially teens, who need to understand that the therapist is not an authority in order to fully benefit from therapy.\n\nIn studies of self-disclosure in therapy, two types have been identified: immediate and non-immediate. Immediate disclosure shows positive views of the therapeutic process in which the two are engaging and communicates self-involving feelings and information about the therapist's professional background. Many see the benefits of this type of disclosure. Non-immediate disclosure, however, is the revealing of more about the therapist than his or her professional background and includes personal insight. This type is rather controversial to psychologists in the present day; many feel it may be more detrimental than it is beneficial in the long-run, but there are significant findings that contradict this claim as well.\n\nFurther, there are two methods that therapists use to disclose: direct and indirect. Direct disclosures grant the client information about personal feelings, background, and professional issues. Indirect disclosures are those not explicitly granted, such as pictures on the therapist's desk and walls or wearing his or her wedding band.\n\nStudies have asked therapists to report their reasons to disclose to clients. The most common reasons are: to answer a direct question from the client, to help soothe the client's feelings of loneliness, to express understanding, to lower a client's anxiety levels and make his or her feelings seem more normal, and to build rapport.\n\nThe topics discussed by therapists who self-disclose in their sessions can vary. The preferred therapeutic approach and the effectiveness of treatments are two of the most common. Many also reveal their views of raising children, stress-coping methods, items that convey respect for the client, and emotions that will validate those the client has expressed. Anecdotes about sexual attraction, dreams, and personal problems seem to be disclosed to subjects with the least frequency by therapists.\n\nThe history of therapist disclosure has been a journey based largely on the therapists' perspectives. Early psychodynamic theorists strongly disagreed with the incorporation of therapist self-disclosure in the client-therapist relationship. Ferenczi notably maintained his belief that self-disclosure was of the utmost importance in children's therapy for traumas in that a neutral, flat therapist would only cause the child to relive the trauma. Object-relations theorists want the client to be able to see how he or she is seen by another and how what she shares is viewed by another, and the best way to operationalize these factors is through a trusting relationship with a therapist who also discloses. Self-theorists believe much the same as object-relations theorists. Intersubjective and relational schools of thought encourage disclosure due to its ability to bring subjectivity into therapy, which they deem a necessary element to real healing. They maintain that therapeutic relationships cannot be initiated and changed without intentional disclosures from both therapist and client.\n\nIn contemporary views, most agree with the inevitability of self-disclosure in therapy. Humanistic theorists want to trigger personal growth in clients and feel that a strong relationship with a therapist is a good facilitator of such, so long as the therapist's disclosures are genuine. Seeing that weakness and struggle are common among all people, even therapists, is useful to clients in the humanistic therapy setting. In order for existential psychologists to help clients, they try to disclose their own coping methods to serve as sources of inspiration to find one's own answers to questions of life. For therapists who value feminism, it is important to disclose personal feelings so that their clients have total freedom to choose the correct therapist and to eliminate power fights within the therapeutic setting. The ever-popular cognitive-behavioral approach also encourages disclosure in therapy so that clients can normalize their own thoughts with someone else's, have their thoughts challenged, and reinforce positive expectations and behaviors.\n\nHumanistic theorists have been the highest in rating self-disclosure as part of their normal therapeutic methods. Clearly, today's therapists are mostly supportive of disclosure in therapy, as the early psychoanalytic taboo of such is slowly being overridden through the recognition of many schools of thought. Most identify the benefit of self-disclosures in facilitating rewarding relationships and helping to reach therapeutic goals.\n\nIt is useful to discuss personal matters in therapy for a variety of reasons. Certain types of disclosures are almost universally recognized as necessary in the early stages of therapy, such as an explanation of the therapeutic approach to be used and particular characteristics of the therapist. Disclosure with another individual facilitates a closeness in that relationship and is strongly believed to lead to a deeper understanding of the self. One will often see his or her disclosure in a more positive perspective if it is shared with someone else. It is thought that disclosing the details of a traumatic experience can greatly help with the organization of related thoughts, and the process of retelling is itself a method of healing. An understanding between therapist and client is achieved when the client can share his or her perceptions without feeling threatened by judgments or unwanted advice. Further, expressing emotions lessens the toll of the autonomic nervous system and has been shown in several studies to improve overall physical health in this way. A disclosing therapist invites his or her client to compare cognitive perceptions and perhaps realize his or her own distortions.\n\nThe disclosure need not be verbal to be advantageous, as writing about traumas and positive experiences alike has been seen to produce less psychological and physiological distress. The Pennebaker Writing Disclosure Paradigm is a method commonly used in therapy settings to facilitate writing about one's experiences. Exposure theory also offers support in that reliving and talking about a negative event should help the negative affect to be more accepted by the individual overtime through extinction.\n\nA study by Watkins (1990) formulated four model hypotheses for the use of self-disclosure in therapy sessions. Supported heavily is the idea of mutuality: disclosure by one leads to disclosure by the other. The modeling hypothesis suggests that the client will model the disclosures of the therapist, thereby learning expression and gaining skills in communication. Some argue for the reinforcement model, saying that the use of self-disclosure by therapists is purely to reinforce self-disclosure in their clients. Lastly, the social exchange hypothesis sees the relationship between client and therapist as an interaction that requires a guide: self-disclosure. Clients' self-reported improvement when a therapist has used disclosure in therapy is high. Regardless, the benefits of validating the client's thoughts through self-disclosure has been shown to be largely beneficial in the scope of therapy.\n\nStudies have also shown the disadvantageous effects of keeping secrets, for they serve as stressors over time. Concealing one's thoughts, actions, or ailments does not allow a therapist to examine and work through the client's problem. Unwanted, recurrent thoughts, feelings of anxiousness and depression, sleeping problems, and many other physiological, psychological, and physical issues have been seen as the results of withholding important information from others.\n\nThe treatment of clients with adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder have been thought to use self-disclosure techniques the most. Therapy sessions for personality disorders, behavior disorders, impulse control disorders, and psychotic disorders seem to use therapist self-disclosure far less often.\n\nTherapists who self-disclose, especially information that validates or reflects the information disclosed by the client, have been rated in studies consistently as demonstrating more warmth and being more personable. A study using participants who were to imagine themselves in hypothetical counseling situations found that therapists who responded to \"What would you do if you were me?\" when asked by the client, were viewed as more socially attractive, more expert, and more trustworthy. Their likability was increased by their willingness to disclose to their clients. The three dimensions mentioned have been said to be of utmost importance when determining one's likability. However, these therapists may also been seen as less professional for these disclosures. Additionally, a therapist who discloses too frequently risks losing focus in the session, talking too much about himself or herself and not allowing the client to actually harvest the benefits of the disclosures in the session through client-focused reflection. Much research has found that successful therapy treatments are enhanced when the client has a largely favorable view of the therapist.\n\nThe atmosphere in which the therapy takes place is crucial too. Research shows that \"soft\" architecture and decor in a room promotes disclosure from clients. This is achieved with rugs, framed photos, and mellow lighting. It is thought that this environment more closely imitates the setting in which friends would share feelings, and so the same might be facilitated between counselor and client. Further, a room should not be too crowded nor too small in order to foster good disclosures from the client\n\nThe efficacy of self-disclosure is widely debated by researchers, and findings have yielded a variety of results, both positive and negative. A typical method of researching such ideas involves self-reports of both therapists and clients. The evaluations of therapists on the positive effects of their own disclosures is far less positive than that of clients' self-reports. Clients are especially likely to assert that the disclosures of their therapists help in their recovery if the disclosures are perceived as more intimate in content. Clients report that disclosures are helpful when they encourage a positive relationship with the therapist, build trust in their therapists' abilities and general person, create a feeling of being better-understood, and make the therapist seem more human. Much of these results, however, are linked to how skilled the therapist is in disclosing.\n\nAny information revealed that could reverse the effects of therapy or switch the roles of therapist and client is thought to be the most detrimental. Therapists must choose wisely in what they disclose and when. A client who is suffering greatly or facing a horrific crisis is not likely to benefit much from therapist self-disclosures. If a client at any point feels he or she, should be acting as a source of support to the therapist, disclosure is only hindering the healing process. Further, clients might become overwhelmed if their initial ideas of therapy do not include any degree of self-disclosure from their counselor, and this will not lead to successful therapy sessions either. It is also a risk to reveal too much about a therapist because the client may begin to see the healer as flawed and untrustworthy. Clients should not feel like they are in competition for time to speak and express themselves during therapy sessions.\n\nDespite contradictory findings, self-disclosure is still used frequently in therapy and is often recommended. The American Psychological Association supports the technique, calling it \"promising and probably effective\". Therapists are advised, however, to use self-disclosure with a mild frequency, to disclose more immediate-disclosure information, to keep intimacy at a minimum, and to keep the focus on the client promptly after disclosure to ensure optimum effectiveness in therapy sessions. Therapist self-disclosure in a counseling setting is ethical so long as the client is not harmed or exploited.\n\nTherapists who use self-involving statements are likely to facilitate valuable self-disclosures from their clients. Using \"I\" statements, a therapist emits a certain level of care not otherwise felt by many clients, and they are likely to benefit from this feeling of being cared for. In cases of a therapist needing to provide feedback, self-involving statements are nearly inevitable, for he or she must state a true opinion of what the client has disclosed. These sorts of \"I\" statements, when used correctly and professionally, are usually seen as especially validating by clients. Largely, the use of self-involving statements by therapists is seen as a way of making the interaction more authentic for the client, and such exchanges can have a great impact on the success of the treatment at hand.\n\nCouples-therapy is often centered on creating more intimacy in a relationship. Spouses are encouraged, or even required, to disclose unexpressed emotions and feelings to their partners. The partners' responses are practiced to be nonjudgmental and accepting. Therapists utilize techniques like rehearsal and the teaching of listening skills. Some fear that this is of little long-term help to the couple because in their real lives, there is no mediator or guiding therapist's hand when one is disclosing to another.\n\nGiven that self-disclosure is related to husband's ratings of marital satisfaction, teaching proper ways for a couple to disclose to one another might be a very beneficial skill therapists can use both for prevention and treatment in therapy sessions.\n\nWhile striving to become more like adults, looking for greater independence, and learning to become more self-reliant, children are also trying to facilitate relationships of equality with their parents. Goals like these, as reported by young people fairly universally, can affect how they disclose to their parents to a large degree. Children's disclosures with their parents has been studied by many, especially recently, after the discoveries of disclosures' positive relationships with children's adjustment levels and psychological and physical health. Some go so far as to use the rate of self-disclosure between parents and children as a dominant measure of the strength of their relationship and its health.\n\nIn adolescents' relationships with their parents, self-disclosure is thought to serve three key functions: \nChildren still attempt to maintain a certain amount of control over their parents' knowledge of their lives by monitoring how and when to disclose to them. Thus, they moderate their parents' potential reactions. Because of this, it is important for parents to be aware of how they react to their children's disclosures, for these reactions will be used as judgment calls for the children's' future sharing.\n\nOften, the reason for disclosing given by children in studies is based on the parent's expectations: \"I've learned that [Mom or Dad] wants to have this information.\" This is adaptive, in that the child has learned what his or her parents want to know. Other times a reason is that the children do not want their parents to worry about them, and this is called parent-centered disclosures. Disclosing in order to make oneself feel better or to ensure protection from parents is considered to be another reason for youth to disclose, and it is called self-oriented disclosure. On a more manipulative level, some adolescents report telling their parents things based solely on gaining an advantage of some sort, whether this is the right to reveal less or the fact that being more open tends to result in more adolescent privileges. Sometimes children qualify their disclosures by merely stating that they only disclose what they feel they want to their parents. Thus, some information is kept secret. This is dubbed selective self-disclosure. In sum, adolescents feel different pulls that make them self-disclose to their parents that can be based on the parents' needs and the children's needs. There has not been a distinct pattern found to predict which reasons will be utilized to explain disclosures by different children. For this reason it is widely believed that the reason for disclosure is largely situation- and context- dependent.\n\nThe self-disclosure of children to their parents is the dominant source of information for parents to gain knowledge about their children and their daily lives. Parental knowledge of their children's whereabouts and daily lives has been linked to several positive outcomes. The more parents know about their kids, the lower the rate of behavior problems among children, and the higher the children's well-being. Adolescents who disclose have been found to have lower rates of substance abuse, lower rates of risky sexual behaviors, lower anxiety levels, and lower rates of depression. Additionally, those who are well-adjusted, meaning they exhibit the qualities discussed above, generally want and enjoy parental involvement and are likely to disclose more. In contrast, keeping secrets from one's parents has been linked to more physical illness, poor behavior, and depression in all cultural groups. Many theorize that in at least one significant relationship one should feel able to disclose nearly completely in order for a healthy personality to develop. While parental behavioral control was once thought to provide the greatest benefits to children in limiting their activities and serving as a source of forced protection, more recent research strongly suggests that disclosures to parents that provide the parents with information about daily activities actually shows the most promise in fostering positive development through childhood and adolescence.\n\nReciprocity in children's self-disclosures is often examined in children's friendships. It has been shown that children's understanding of friendship involves sharing secrets with another person. This mutual exchange of sharing secrets could be the norm of reciprocity, in which individuals disclose because it is a social norm. This norm of reciprocity is shown to begin occurring for children in sixth grade. Sixth graders are able to understand the norm of reciprocity because they realize that relationships require both partners to cooperate and to mutually exchange secrets. They realize this because they possess the cognitive ability to take another person's perspective into account and are able to understand a third person's views which allows them to view friendships as an ongoing systematic relationship.\n\nChildren in sixth grade are also shown to understand equivalent reciprocity. Equivalent reciprocity requires matching the level of intimacy a partner discloses, therefore, a high-intimacy disclosure would be matched with an equally revealing disclosure while a low-intimacy disclosure would be matched with little information revealed. Another type of reciprocity is covariant reciprocity, in which disclosures are more intimate if a partner communicates a high-intimacy disclosure instead of a low-intimacy disclosure. This differs from equivalent reciprocity, which matches the level of intimacy, while covariant reciprocity only focuses on whether someone disclosed something personal or not. Covariant reciprocity is shown to begin in fourth grade.\n\nIt has also been shown that girls across all ages disclose more intimate information than boys, and that the number of disclosures a child reveals increases with age.\n\nEarly studies note two distinct factors that contribute to how much children self-disclose to their parents. The first is intraindividual factors, which are those that are on the child's mind and cause him or her to need social input. Biological development, cultural and social pressures, and individual maturity determine these issues, and, thus, a child's age, personality, and background also contribute to his or her level and need of self-disclose in a relationship with a parent.\n\nThe second set of factors is called contextual factors, which include the opportunities and situations that the individual has to disclose as created by the sociocultural environment. These are most directly related, then, to the target of the disclosure; these targets are the parents.\n\nAlso, gender contributes: girls are noted for usually disclosing their problems, mostly to their mothers, while boys reveal more about bad grades, behavioral conflicts, and other issues to both parents.\n\nCertain people are more likely to get others to disclose. These are called high openers. Even people known to disclose very little are likely to disclose more to high openers. Thus, if parents are characterized as good listeners, trustworthy, accepting, relaxed, and sympathetic, as are high openers, then they will likely elicit more disclosure from their children. Adolescents who view their parents like this are also said to see them as less controlling and less likely to react negatively to their disclosures. Parental responsiveness has been said to be the dominant factor of influence on adolescents' rates of self-disclosure; warmth and affection facilitate more disclosures. Parental psychological control has also been linked to increased self-disclosure of personal issues and peer issues among youth. While this sort of control is not often thought of in a positive light, some hypothesize that these kids are likely just feeling coerced to disclose subtly and without being harmed. Much of what children choose to reveal to their parents is based on previous disclosures and their parents' reactions to them.\n\nFeelings about the parent-child relationship during one's upbringing have also be found to correlate with the child's disclosures to the parents. A child with a positive memory of his or her relationship with a parent during the past years is a predictor of a higher level of self-disclosure. In fact, the view of the parent-child relationship in the past is a stronger predictor than that of the child's view of the current parent-child relationship. The relationship with the mother, in particular, is extremely predictive of disclosures from adolescents. Such findings suggest to parents that fostering secure attachment early in their children will better set the stage for disclosures in the later years, and their children may then reap the benefits of such a relationship.\n\nAdolescents are able to determine their own amount of parental authority over certain issues by how much or how little they choose to disclose to their parents. Surveys revealed that they are least likely to share information that involves their personal feelings and activities. They actively resist disclosing this to their parents because they do not see the issues as being harmful, or they feel their parents will not listen to them, or because the matters are very private to them.\n\nThe way adolescents perceive their parents' authority as legitimate largely impacts how much they feel obligated to disclose to them. The more authority the children believe their parents rightly possess, the more obligation they perceive to share their lives accordingly. Parents who attempt a large degree of psychological control over their children are unlikely to be disclosed to as frequently, which only makes logical sense given the fact that most children are searching for a sense of autonomy. The adolescents have been found to feel the most obligation to tell their parents about such activities as drinking and smoking but less need to disclose information about personal issues. Not surprising either, less obligation is felt as age increases. Contrary to popular belief though, most adolescents in the US do not consider themselves to be adults between the ages of 18 and 27, and their parents feel the same way. The age at which children feel they no longer are obligated to disclose to their parents has increased over time, and the same trend is predicted over the next few decades.\n\nOften, the motivation to disclose negative behaviors is purely because the children fear that they will not get away with it or feel obligated to share. Adolescents also want to disclose more if they feel that the activities in question are out of their own jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is measured, in the adolescents' minds, as how short-term and close the activities are. Short-term, close activities are judged as ones to be handled without disclosure to parents, while activities that will take longer or require the adolescent to be farther from home are thought of as being issues to discuss with parents.\n\nCertain events and characteristics of the parent-child relationship make disclosures unlikely:\n\nCertain events and characteristics of the parent-child relationship make the child less willing to disclose to that parent in the future:\n\nCertain events and characteristics of the parent-child relationship make disclosures likely:\n\nCertain events and characteristics of the parent-child relationship make the child more likely to disclose to that parent in the future:\n\nThere are four major differences between online communication and face to face communication. The first is that Internet users can remain anonymous. The user can choose what personal information (if any) they share with other users. Even if the user decides to use their own name, if communicating with people in others cities or countries they are still relatively anonymous. The second is that physical distance does not limit interaction on the Internet the way it does in real life. The Internet gives the ability to interact with people all over the world and the chance to meet people who have similar interests that one may not have met in their offline life. Visual cues, including those pertaining to physical attractiveness, are also not always present on the Internet. These factors have been shown to influence initial attraction and relationship formation. Finally, Internet users have time to formulate conversations which is not allotted in face to face conversation. This gives a user more control in the conversation because they do not have to give an immediate response.\n\nAnonymity can allow individuals to take greater risks and discuss how they truly feel with others. A person might take these risks because they are more aware of their private self. Private self-awareness is when a person becomes more aware of personal features of the self. This is in contrast to public self-awareness in which a person realizes that they can be judged by others. This type of awareness can lead to evaluation apprehension, where a person fears receiving a negative evaluation from their peers. Public self-awareness is also associated with conforming to group norms even if they go against personal beliefs. With that said, the absence of visual cues from a partner in Internet discussion can activate a person's private self which encourages self-disclosure. This is because the discloser is not worried about being judged publicly and is able to express their own private thoughts. Anonymity also aids in identity construction. A person can change their gender and the way they relate to others due to anonymity. This can increase life satisfaction because those who can identify with multiple roles are shown to be more satisfied. Since the Internet can allow someone to adopt these roles, that close others may not accept in the real world, it can increase their self-worth and acceptance.\nThe anonymity that comes with Internet communication also makes it easier to reveal the \"true self\". The \"true self\", as described by McKenna and her colleagues includes the traits a person possesses but is unable to share freely with others. What they do share is the \"actual self\" which includes traits they do possess and are able to be shown in social settings. The actual self can be easier to present in face to face conversations because a person's true self may not fit societal norms. Disclosing one's \"true self\" has been shown to create empathetic bonds and aid in forming close relationships.\n\nAnonymity can also help stigmatized groups reveal their \"true selves\" and allow them to come together to discuss aspects of the self that cannot be discussed in one's social circle. This can help them in life because it allows them to form a group of similar others and the opportunity to receive emotional support. It has also been found that those who join these groups and disclose their identity were more likely to share this aspect of the self with their close family and friends. Sharing these long kept secrets has also shown to significantly reduce health symptoms over a length of time.\n\nThere are some negative consequences to being anonymous on the Internet. Deindividuation, where self-awareness is blocked by environmental conditions, can occur and be problematic. Some consequences of deindividuation include the reduced ability to control one's behavior and engage in rational, long-term planning, and the tendency to react immediately and emotionally. A person who is lacking this self-awareness is also less likely to care about other's opinions of his or her behavior. This all can lead to increased hostility towards others and the formation of anonymous hate groups.\n\nThere can also be some negative consequences to forming multiple selves. If these identities are not integrated it can lead to an incomplete sense of self. They could also be brought into the real world and lead to delusional and unrealistic behavior.\nOne downside to all of the connections that can be formed online regards the effect called the \"illusion of large numbers.\" This effect means that people overestimate how many people share the same opinion as them. This can be especially harmful if someone holds negative views of a particular group because they may not realize that their views are very different from the mainstream.\n\nPhysical attractiveness plays an important role in determining if two people will begin a relationship. In face to face conversation, if initial attraction is not present, the relationship is less likely to form. This, however, does not play a role in Internet communication. Relationships online must form based on things such as similarities, values, interests or an engaging conversation style. Since these relationships form at a deeper level they may be more durable and more important to the individual. Not being seen also assists in presenting ideal qualities (attributes an individual would ideally like to possess) to other users because there is no information to contradict what they say, the way there is in face to face conversation. This can help a person make these ideal qualities a social reality because when someone confirms these traits the individual can make them a part of their self-concept.\n\nAn individual is also liked more on the Internet than in face to face conversation. Even if partners think they are communicating with two different people they still like the person from the Internet more than the face to face interaction, even though they were the same person. This greater liking also continues after the initial interaction on the Internet when the pair meets face to face. This greater liking may occur because of the lack of physical information. Physical attractiveness plays an important role in impression formation and once these views are formed they are not likely to be changed even when presented with new information. Since the people communicating online cannot rely on attractiveness these factors may not play a role when they eventually meet face to face. An increase in disclosures can also foster this liking because intimate disclosure is associated with increased intimacy. Online disclosures are generally seen as more intimate than face to face disclosures. Since there is a lack of nonverbal cues in Internet communication, many people form a biased perception of their communication partner. The minimal cues that are available in computer based communication are often over interpreted and the person will attach greater value to them. For example, if there seems to be a similarity between the two communicating, an individual may intensify this perception and idealize their partner. This all then increases the perceived intimacy of the discloser.\n\nPeople are more likely to form relationships with those who are in close physical proximity of them. Individuals are also more likely to begin an interaction with someone who is seen on a regular basis, showing that familiarity also influences interactions. Communicating on the Internet can allow individuals to become familiar with those who frequent the pages they converse on by recognizing usernames and pages. Regardless of how far away these individuals may be from each other, they are all in one confined space on the Internet which can give the feeling of being in the same place. The Internet also brings people together that may not have met because of physical distance. They can also go to specific websites where people share the same interests so they enter conversations knowing they already have similarities. This can contribute to why Internet relationships form so quickly. These online users do not have to go through the traditional stages that face to face interactions require in order to find similar interests. These face to face interactions usually take longer to find common ground but online users are able to dive right into conversations.\n\nInternet communication differs significantly from face-to-face conversation in the timing and pacing of a conversation. For example, both users do not need to be online at the same time to have a conversation. E-mail, for example, allows individuals to send messages and wait for a reply that may not come for hours or even days. This can allow many people to stay in touch, even if they are in different time zones, which significantly broadens the range of communication.\n\nThis communication also allows an individual to take their time when speaking with someone. They do not have to have an immediate response that face-to-face conversation requires. This allows them to carefully select and edit their messages and gives them more control over their side of the conversation that they would not have outside of the Internet. There are also no interruptions in online communication that occur in face-to-face conversation. A person is able to \"hold the floor\" and say as little or as much as they would like in these communications, allowing them to fully form their point.\n\nThis control helps users to take greater risks with their self-disclosures online. These people also begin to incorporate their Internet lives with their non-Internet lives and engage in a presence–control exchange. In this exchange, Internet users start their relationships with relatively high control and gradually trade that for physical closeness as their comfort levels and knowledge of the other person increases. This seems to be the Internet version of social penetration theory, where individuals have a mutual exchange of self-disclosures. As the relationship develops in face-to-face communication the individuals' disclosures gradually become more revealing and cover a wide range of topics. This equivalent on the Internet includes the partners exchanging control of the conversation for physical closeness. The stages this occurs in could include moving from messaging online, to telephone conversations and eventually face-to-face communication.\n\nThe use of social media for self-disclosure has shown to be very helpful for those with low self-esteem. People with low self-esteem are more socially anxious and shy which can make it difficult to form close relationships with others. This can harm both their physical and mental health because feeling connected to others is considered a fundamental human motivation. Individuals with low self-esteem have difficulty disclosing to others because they are very focused on not revealing their flaws and fear criticism and disapproval from others. Disclosing less, therefore, protects them from the possibility of rejection or being ignored. \nIn light of these fears, social media can provide a safe environment for people with low self-esteem to disclose personal information because they cannot see their partner's reactions which can help them to more freely express themselves.\n\nWhile many with low self-esteem do view social media as a safe outlet for disclosure, many do not receive positive feedback for their disclosures. People with low self-esteem tend to post more negative thoughts on social media which has been shown to make them less liked by readers. Negative posts are also more likely to be ignored by readers in hopes that the discloser will stop and begin to post more positively. When someone who frequently shares negative thoughts posts something positive they do receive more positive feedback from readers. In contrast, someone with high self-esteem is more liked by readers and tends to post more positively. If they do post something negative they tend to get more responses than those with low self-esteem do.\n\nSocial media can also help those who are lonely. Many social networking sites give access to profiles, pictures and the ability to comment and message others which helps people to feel less lonely. It also aids them in gaining social capital like emotional satisfaction and access to information. These sites can facilitate disclosure because they make it easier to access others who can provide social support for someone to disclose personal information. Social support is extremely important in disclosure as it makes the discloser feel validated and cared for. Social support is also positively related to well-being. It has also been shown that having this social support and forming close relationships online decreases loneliness overtime.\n\nSome research does show that spending too much time on the Internet and forming these close relationships could take away time from existing non-Internet relationships. Neglecting these relationships could make a person lonelier in the long run because they could lose these face to face relationships.\n\nHowever, other research shows that there are certain personality traits that lead to increased loneliness which then leads to increased use of the Internet. In particular, extroversion and neuroticism have been linked to loneliness. An extrovert is someone who is outgoing, enjoys the company of others, requires stimulation, and is spontaneous, while an introvert prefers his or her own company, is quiet, and prefers quiet, small gatherings. Introverts can often be seen as distant and unfriendly because of this behavior which may explain some of their loneliness. A neurotic person is extremely anxious, emotional and reacts in a disproportional way to many situations. Someone high in neuroticism generally has a negative attitude which may push people away and prevent them from forming close relationships which may lead to their loneliness. Both of these groups (introverts and neurotics) have been shown to have increased Internet use and in particular increased use of social service sites (i.e. chatrooms, newsrooms, etc.). This may show that those who are already lonely are more attracted to the Internet as a means of social networking and not that the Internet increases loneliness. Introverts and neurotic individuals have also been shown to feel more comfortable revealing their \"true-self\" online than in face-to-face conversation and revealing the \"real you\" has been shown to help the discloser to form close relationships.\n\nIt can be very difficult for those with social anxiety to engage in face to face communication. These people can become anxious when meeting someone for the first time, speaking with someone attractive, or participating in group activities. This can limit their in-person interactions and deny them their basic needs of intimacy and belonging. With the absence of many of these worries in Internet communication, many with social anxieties use it to form social connections. It has been shown that individuals with social anxiety are more likely to use the Internet to form close relationships. These relationships are also shown to be stronger online relationships as opposed to weaker relationships (i.e. \"acquaintances\"). Forming these relationships can also help a socially anxious person express their true-self and form their social identity. This identity often involves the groups a person is a part of because belonging to a group frequently becomes a part of one's self-concept. Someone with social anxiety would be denied this because of their fear of face-to-face interaction. Therefore, disclosing with others online gives a socially anxious person access to a wide variety of people with which they can form relationships and belong to a group.\n\nSocially anxious people are also shown to become less anxious over time if they have formed close online relationships. They have also been shown to broaden their social circles in the \"real world\" when they have had this time to form online relationships. One possibility for this occurrence may be that these online relationships can give the anxious individuals confidence in forming relationships outside of the Internet. Being able to practice communications online can show them they are capable of communicating and can lessen their anxieties in face to face communication. They are also very likely to bring their online relationships into their offline lives in order to make them a \"social reality\" by sharing these relationships with family and friends in the real world.\n\nOnline support groups are another place where people from all over can come together to disclose common struggles. They provide an environment of mutual disclosure and support. People are more likely to use these forums to discuss personal struggles and disclose emotions and thoughts pertaining to these struggles than normal discussion forums. There is also a higher degree of reciprocity in online support groups than in normal discussion forums and reciprocity has been shown to help people feel valued after disclosing. Men and women are also equally likely to use these forums for disclosing personal information.\n\nWhile there are many benefits to engaging in self-disclosure online there are also some dangers. There is a relationship between Internet abuse, self-disclosure and problematic behavior. Internet abuse can be defined as, \"patterns of using the Internet that result in disturbances in a person's life but does not imply a specific disease process or addictive behavior.\" When a person is high for Internet abuse and high for self-disclosure it can lead to dangerous behaviors like sending personal information (addresses, home phone number etc.) and photos to online acquaintances. High ratings for Internet abuse and self-disclosure also positively influence online communication with all types of online relationships. These relationship types include long-distance relationships, in which people have met face to face and continue the relationship by communicating online; purely virtual relationships, where people meet online and stay in touch only by using the Internet; and migratory mixed-mode, where the relationship begins online and then proceeds to face to face interaction. The relationship between Internet abuse, self-disclosure and dangerous behaviors could pose an even bigger problem with the high number of communications this group has with others, particularly those they have only communicated with online.\n\nThe Internet, while providing most with a source of entertainment, knowledge, and social realms, is actually a large threat to children due to the ways in which they self-disclose. Their privacy is often more at risk than is an adults because of their openness to sites. Given that they are still developing, researchers say that they are in the \"Cued Processors\" group between the ages of eight and eleven. At this time, many children are using the Internet and are doing so alone, without the guidance and overseeing of an adult/guardian. Thus, they must use their own judgments to decide how much information to share on the various sites they visit.\n\nAs \"Cued Processors\", however, they are only able to think logically about concrete events; the notion of their disclosures online being used against them is far in the abstract world. They will likely not think of any sort of consequences that could result from their disclosures, and this is just what online marketers and predators alike expect and are looking for. Combined with behavioral profiling tracking programs, online advertisers and predators can build a pretty clear image of the child and what he or she likes to do, where he or she lives, his or her phone number, his or her school district, and other sources of identifying information that they use to prompt the child to disclose without his or her really knowing. A common strategy is the use of brand characters in online games who \"ask\" for the information; children are especially likely to give out very personal information in this sort of setting. The children's vulnerability online is a product of their cognitive limitations.\n\nUses and gratifications theory is often used to attempt to explain such things as motivation on the Internet. Studies have found that, if applied to the use of the Internet by children and their likelihood to disclose personal information, one can find significant correlations with various types of motivation. Children who use the Internet primarily as a source of information are less likely to give out personal information. Some theorize that these children are simply made to be more aware of the dangers of Internet disclosures and are more cautious because of this. But, children who mention social contact on the Internet as their first-order use are more often the ones who submit to the attempts of online marketers and predators who seek their personal contact information and behavioral preferences. These children have goals of social acceptance in mind, and it seems to them that acceptance can be easily gained from sharing and communicating with friends and strangers alike. Socializing motives reduce privacy concerns, and children will disclose nearly anything online in order to be seen and responded to socially. It was also discovered that a simple incentive is usually enough to elicit personal information from a child.\n\nParents' knowledge of their children's Internet use is rapidly decreasing. Children are withholding more and more from their parents, including how much information they are sharing over the Internet. Parent-child self-disclosure about this topic needs to be increased if interventions are to help keep children safer online. Notably, there are many parents who have even admitted to allowing their children to lie about their ages on social media sites in order to gain access to them. Parents, thus, are encouraged to remain open to discussing such things with their children, to use better judgment themselves when making decisions about their children's Internet usage, and to provide them with education about how privacy on the Internet is a risky notion.\n\nToday, many regulations are being proposed and implemented that will hopefully help protect children's personal information on the Internet. However, these will not be enough to guarantee safe exchanges of self-disclosure, so adults still must be open to discussion with their children.\n\nSelf-disclosure is an important matter to consider in the realm of education. The varying ways that it can impact social relations adds a new and important dynamic to the classroom. There are different results and experiences that students and teachers see from the implementation of self-disclosure in the classroom. The relationships that will be addressed through the lens of self-disclosure include the student to teacher relationship, the student to student relationship and how cultural relations impacts the situation as a whole.\n\nThe tone of the classroom is set by the attitudes and behaviors of those who participate in it. The teacher often has the most powerful role in leading a classroom and how that class will interact and connect through the subject matter. The practice of self-disclosure in the interactions between the teachers and the students has an impact on the classroom atmosphere and how the people perform in that atmosphere. The decision to practice self-disclosure as a teacher has many benefits and challenges.\n\nWhen the teacher engages in self-disclosure with the students, it opens up a new channel of communication in the classroom. As the teacher shares more information about who they are and their personal life, the students begin to see a new side of their teacher that is more than the person that stands in the front of their classroom everyday. The teacher is seen as a real person with their own difficulties and struggles in life. This would allow the teacher to appear more relatable to the students which would promote better student to teacher communication. Of course, the information shared with the class must be appropriate and relevant. A teacher may use an illustration of a concept using an example from their own life in order to connect with a particular audience in the class. These connections with the teacher promotes a more productive relationship.\n\nAs the teacher sets the tone of self-disclosure, students feel more willing to share in the practice of self-disclosure as well. The teacher demonstrates and helps to guide the students in understanding what is appropriate information to share in public discourses. As the students feel more comfortable with the teacher and begin sharing more about their own lives, the environment of the classroom is one of camaraderie and friendship. By understanding the people in the classroom on a deeper level can open up opportunities to provide support to those involved. The teacher can better understand who the students are, what they struggle with, what their strengths are and what they need to succeed. Self-disclosure from student to teacher allows the teacher to best support the students based on their individual needs, therefore providing an improved education.\n\nWith implementing self-disclosure into the classroom, comes a set of negative consequences and challenges. As the teacher shares more about their personal life, the students may become overly comfortable with the teacher. This could lead to a lack of respect for the teacher or an inability to maintain appropriate superior relationship. Self-disclosure may blur the lines of the roles between the student and the teacher, which could disrupt the authority the teacher needs to maintain their role in the classroom and have an effective teaching persona. There is the case that not all students will connect to this method of teaching. Some students may not choose to participate in this environment which could lead them to feel alienated. Self-disclosure from the teacher needs to be taken into deep consideration so that the sharing of information does not take away from the education being transferred.\n\nThere are some risks involved in bringing self-disclosure into the classroom when students begin sharing information with the teacher. As the student is more open with the teacher, there is the chance that the student could share information that would require the teacher to follow a reporting procedure. If a student reveals information about themselves in confidence to the teacher that implies that the students life is potentially at risk, or other matters of equal seriousness that would need to be reported to the school guidance counselor. Revealing this information although confidentiality was implied would inevitably break the trust the teacher has built with the student, ultimately harming their relationship. This hurt relationship could negatively impact that students ability to learn in the classroom. In another scenario, students may not fully understand the differences between public and private discourse. This would lead students to have conversations of self-disclosure in the classroom when the timing is not appropriate, therefore, taking away from the educational matters at hand.\n\nSelf-disclosure, just like anything varies and differs depending on the culture. Collectivistic culture and individualism are two types of ways to explain self disclosure is a culture. If a country is more on the collectivistic side then they will tend to disclose themselves more as an Avatar, like in China and Germany. However, in a more individualist culture setting people open up more about themselves, even personal details, like in America. There is also a difference in the boy vs. girl culture. Girls tend to open up more and easier than most boys.\n\nEach culture has a different idea about what and how much self-disclosure is acceptable. For example, American students tend to share more in class with their peers than Chinese students. They are usually more open about themselves and interests with most of their classmates than students in other countries. The difference is seen in the internet as well. Korean students usually talk more in blog form on social media pages keeping the posts short and to the point. However, American students share more often and share more personal information to their followers. Cultures like Korea and China, the collectivistic cultures, are more reserved whereas, the American culture is more about disclosing a lot of personal details.\n\n"}

It has become a cult film in Serbia and other countries from the former Yugoslavia region and is regarded as one of the classics of Yugoslav Serbian cinematography.\n\nThe story takes place in an unnamed small Serbian town in 1935, and focuses on the Topalović family consisting of six generations of undertakers: gravely ill Pantelija, wheelchair-bound Maksimilijan who's also mute and nearly deaf, rheumatic Aksentije, sober-minded Milutin, impulsive and narcissistic Laki, and young and naive Mirko. Constantly bickering amongst each other, the latest family arguments arise from the youngest son, Mirko, not wanting to continue the family business of coffin-making. Deeply in love with a local girl Kristina, the daughter of a local hoodlum Bili Piton, he's looking to avoid the career path of his father, grandfather, great grandfather, etc. \n\nThough operating out of a prominently located shop in the town, Topalovićs' business is mostly based on illegal activities. Instead of making brand new coffins, they simply recycle already used ones with the help of Bili Piton, whose men dig them out from the local cemetery during the night. Once they get their hands on the coffins that had been dug up, Topalovićs simply refurbish them and sell them as new, thereby making a large profit with very little overhead. Based on mutual financial interest, the business relationship between Topalovićs and Bili is deteriorating by the day as they owe him a large sum of money for the past services rendered and show no intention of paying him.\n\nIn parallel, Topalovićs are in the finishing stages of building a modern crematory on which they're placing high hopes as the future source of income.\n\nOne day, the oldest Topalović, Pantelija, dies and leaves family inheritance to himself because he does not trust his successors. Topalovićs leave business with Bili Piton and he threatens to report them to the police for killing a man in a car accident. Bili's daughter, Mirko's love Kristina wishes to become an actress in (mostly pornographic) movies made by Mirko's best friend Đenka. However, she cheats on Mirko with Đenka, so outraged Mirko kills her when he finds out. He returns to his family and makes himself their leader by force, while Đenka is accidentally burned alive by the deaf Maksimilijan, while repairing the crematorium. The movie ends with a showdown between the Topalovićs and Bili Piton, in which Bili Piton is killed, and then a chase between Topalovićs and the police, with a scene abruptly cut just as raging Mirko attempts to run over a police officer fallen from a bicycle.\n\nThe Marathon Family won two awards in 1982, including the Jury Prize at the Montréal World Film Festival and the \"Best Actress\" award at the Pula Film Festival, which went to Seka Sablić for her portrayal of Kristina.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22314077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22314077", "title": "Thokcha", "text": "Thokcha\n\nThokcha (; also alternatively ) \"sky-iron\" are tektites and meteorites which are often high in iron content, refer iron meteorite. The usage of meteoric iron is common in the history of ferrous metallurgy. Historically, thokchas were held in esteem for sacred metallurgical fabrication of weapons, musical instruments and sacred tools, e.g. phurba. Their inclusion as an auspicious addition in the metallurgical fabrication of sacred objects cast of Panchaloha is documented. The term has also come to denote ancient metal objects which serve as amulets made from thokcha. They are traditionally held to be endowed with magic and protective power and in this respect are comparable to Tibetan Dzi beads.\n\nBeer (1999: p. 234) holds that:\n\"Meteoric iron or 'sky-iron' (Tib. gnam lcags) is the supreme substance for forging the physical representation of the vajra or other iron weapons, since it has already been tempered by the celestial gods in its passage across the heavens. The indivisibility of form and emptiness is a perfect metaphor for the image of a meteorite or 'stone fallen from the sky', manifesting out of the voidness of space as a shooting star or fireball, and depositing a chunk of fused 'sky iron' on the earth below. Many vajras held by deities as weapons are described as being forged from meteorite iron, and Tibet, with its high altitude, thin atmosphere and desolate landscape, received an abundance of meteorite fragments. Tibetan vajras were often cast from meteorite iron, and as an act of sympathetic magic a piece of the meteoric iron was often returned to its original site.\"\n\nOne can roughly divide the thokchas into two groups, the first comprising objects of pre-Buddhist period (from about 1000 BC until 900 AD), the second belonging to the Buddhist period (after 7th century AD), the two periods slightly overlapping. Some of the early thokchas may be related to the Tibetan Zhang zhung culture.\n\nThokchas are metal objects which can have a length of about . Originally they can have had a practical use such as having been part of horse harnesses, or having served as buckles, fibulae or arrow heads. \nThey can have served as adornment for clothes or objects of daily use like lighters and purses. Thokchas can represent mythological and real animals or deities from Tibet’s Bön or Buddhist religion. Many are of a more abstract form and the meaning of these pieces remains uncertain.\n\nThe word thokcha is composed of two words, \"thog\" meaning above, first or thunderbolt and \"lcags\" meaning iron or metal. The meaning of thokcha can thus be given as \"first or original iron\" or \"thunderbolt iron\". The popular belief is that thokchas can be formed naturally or magically when a thunderbolt strikes the earth.

{"id": "733001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=733001", "title": "Three Colours trilogy", "text": "Three Colours trilogy\n\nThe \"Three Colours\" trilogy (, ) is the collective title of three films directed by Krzysztof Kieślowski, two made in French and one primarily in Polish: \"\" (1993), \"\" (1994), and \"\" (1994). All three were co-written by Kieślowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz (with story consultants Agnieszka Holland and Sławomir Idziak) and have musical scores by Zbigniew Preisner.\n\n\"Red\" received nominations for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography at the 67th Academy Awards.\n\nBlue, white, and red are the colours of the French flag in left-to-right order, and the story of each film is loosely based on one of the three political ideals in the motto of the French Republic: liberty, equality, fraternity. As with the treatment of the Ten Commandments in \"Dekalog\", the illustration of these principles is often ambiguous and ironic. As Kieślowski noted in an interview with an Oxford University student newspaper, “The words [\"liberté, egalité, fraternité\"] are French because the money [to fund the films] is French. If the money had been of a different nationality we would have titled the films differently, or they might have had a different cultural connotation. But the films would probably have been the same.”\n\nThe trilogy is also interpreted respectively as an anti-tragedy, an anti-comedy, and an anti-romance.\n\nA symbol common to the three films is that of an underlying link or thing that keeps the protagonist linked to their past. In the case of \"Blue\", it is the lamp of blue beads, and a symbol seen throughout the film in the TV of people falling (doing either sky diving or bungee jumping); the director is careful to show falls with no cords at the beginning of the film, but as the story develops the image of cords becomes more and more apparent as a symbol of a link to the past. In the case of \"White\" the item that links Karol to his past is a 2 Fr. coin and a plaster bust of Marianne that he steals from an antique store in Paris. In the case of \"Red\" the judge never closes or locks his doors and his fountain pen, which stops working at a crucial point in the story.\n\nAnother recurring image related to the spirit of the film is that of elderly people recycling bottles: In \"Blue\", an old woman in Paris is recycling bottles and Julie does not notice her (in the spirit of freedom), in \"White\", an old man also in Paris is trying to recycle a bottle but cannot reach the container and Karol looks at him with a sinister grin on his face (in the spirit of equality) and in \"Red\" an old woman cannot reach the hole of the container and Valentine helps her (in the spirit of fraternity).\n\nIn \"Blue\", while Julie is searching for her husband's mistress in the central courthouse, she accidentally steps into an active court trial and is immediately turned around by security. While Julie is peeking into the courtroom, Karol from \"White\" can be heard pleading to the judge in a scene that begins his chapter of the trilogy.\n\nEach films' ending shot is of a character crying. In \"Blue\", Julie de Courcy cries looking into space. In \"White\", Karol cries as he looks at his wife. In \"Red\", the judge Kern cries as he looks through his broken window out at the camera.\n\nMany main characters from \"Blue\" and \"White\", including Julie and Karol, appear at the ending of \"Red\" as survivors of a ferry accident.\n\n\nMusic for all three parts of the trilogy was composed by Zbigniew Preisner and performed by Silesian Philharmonic choir along with Sinfonia Varsovia.\n\n\"\" holds a 98% rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website, based on 43 reviews. The second part of the trilogy, \"\", was ranked with 88% based on 43 reviews, while its final film, \"\", was certified \"Fresh\" on the same website and received 100% based on 51 reviews.\n\nRoger Ebert included the trilogy in its entirety to his \"Great Movies\" list.\n\nRanked #11 in \"Empire\" magazine's \"The 33 Greatest Movie Trilogies\" in 2010.\n\nRanked #14 in \"Empire\" magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.\n\n"}

Conventional lists separate Sargon from Menes by around five hundred years. Commenting on this and other works, the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" says \"These works, containing much painstaking research and impressive to many, did not win the approval of experts.\"\n\nWaddell's primary chronology was compiled from various Sumerian king lists, Egyptian list of pharaohs, the Bhagavata Purana, Mahabharata, Rigveda and numerous Indus Valley Civilization seals and other monuments and relics and sources, some of which he had deciphered himself.

{"id": "7363727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7363727", "title": "Whoniverse", "text": "Whoniverse\n\nThe Whoniverse is the non-narrative name given to the fictional setting of the television series \"Doctor Who\", \"Torchwood\", \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" and \"Class\" as well as other related media. The word, a portmanteau of the words \"Who\" and \"universe\", has also been used to describe the show's production and fanbase.\n\nThe term is used to link characters, ideas or items which are seen across multiple productions, such as Sarah Jane Smith from \"Doctor Who\", \"K-9 and Company\" (1981) and \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" (2007–2011), Jack Harkness from \"Doctor Who\" and \"Torchwood\" as well as K-9 from \"Doctor Who\", \"K-9 and Company\", \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\", and \"K-9\".\n\nUnlike the owners of other science fiction franchises, the BBC takes no position on canon, and recent producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea. The term has recently begun to appear in mainstream press coverage following the popular success of the 2005 \"Doctor Who\" revival.\n\nSome have also speculated that the \"Blake's 7\" series is also part of the same universe, due to a character known as Carnell appearing in the Blake's 7 episode, Weapon, who would also later appear in the Doctor Who novel, \"Corpse Marker\" and the \"Kaldor City\" spin-off audio series.\n\nThe Whoniverse is also referred to as Earth-5556.\n\nThe Whoniverse has given rise to a wide variety of lifeforms, including the Time Lords, the Daleks, and the Cybermen, as well as the Sontarans, Silurians, Ice Warriors, and the Weeping Angels, who have appeared in several episodes.\n\nDue to the time travelling nature of the show, the Whoniverse setting has been covered across points from its formation in a big bang event (in 1983's \"Terminus\" and the 1985 audio drama \"Slipback\"), to its heat death in the year \"100 trillion\" (\"Utopia\" 2007). Important events shown include the Time War, the formation of the Earth and its eventual destruction in the year \"5 billion\" (\"The End of the World\" 2005), and the destruction and recreation of the universe (\"The Pandorica Opens\"/\"The Big Bang\").\n\nIn his 1983 book \"Doctor Who: A Celebration; Two Decades Through Time and Space\", Peter Haining called his final chapter \"The Whoniverse\". The section assembled factual information about all the episodes to date, but also gave information about fan clubs and ancillary entertainments related to the programme. Thus, the term \"Whoniverse\" referred to everything connected with the programme behind-the-scenes. In this meaning, standing exhibitions, discussions about the filming of episodes and even the fandom itself were considered part of the \"Whoniverse\". The term \"Whoniverse\" is still used with this definition today, including as the name of a \"Doctor Who\" convention in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3999277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3999277", "title": "Year-round school in the United States", "text": "Year-round school in the United States\n\nFour percent of US public schools, mostly at the elementary level, use a year-round calendar. A 2016 review defined the year-round school calendar as follows:Unlike the much rarer “extended-year” calendar, which can have more than 200 days of instruction, a year-round calendar does not increase instruction time. Instead, a year-round calendar takes the usual 175-180 instruction days and redistributes them, replacing the usual schedule -- nine months on, three months off -- with a more “balanced” schedule of short instruction periods alternating with shorter breaks across all four seasons of the year. There are several year-round calendars in use; the most popular alternate 9 or 12-week instruction periods with 3- or 4-week breaks. Year-round calendars include a summer break that is longer than other breaks during the year, but still shorter than the summer break on a traditional nine-month calendar.\n\nA 2016 review summarized the research on year-round schools as followsThe effects of year-round calendars on test scores...once thought to be positive...now appear to be neutral at best. Although year-round calendars do increase summer learning, they reduce learning at other times of year, so that the total amount learned over a 12-month period is no greater under a year-round calendar than under a nine-month calendar. [There is also] evidence that year-round calendars make it harder to recruit and retain experienced teachers, make it harder for mothers to work outside the home, and reduce property values.\n\nBusinesses that rely on summer leisure time dislike year-round calendars. Summer camps and amusement parks often lead political opposition to year-round calendars, but some opposition is led by upper middle class parents who value summer vacations. Rural areas rarely use year-round calendars because they conflict with farms' need for youth labor in summer.\n\nYear-round calendars can offer a way to reduce school crowding, A crowded school can adopt a multi-track year-round calendar, which staggers student schedules so that different groups of students attend on different calendars, or \"tracks,\" with some students attending while others are on break. In this way the school can handle more students than it could if all students needed to be in school at the same time. Multi-track year-round calendars have been used to reduce crowding in California, greater Las Vegas, and greater Raleigh, North Carolina, among other places.\" \n\nCompared to other ways to handle crowding -- such as busing or portable classrooms -- multi-track year-round calendars can be relatively inexpensive. However, if schools are open for longer, the operating and maintenance costs may increase up to 10 percent.\n"}
