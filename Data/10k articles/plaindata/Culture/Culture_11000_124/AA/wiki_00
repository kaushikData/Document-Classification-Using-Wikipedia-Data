{"id": "605939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=605939", "title": "Akira (1988 film)", "text": "Akira (1988 film)\n\nAkira (Japanese: アキラ Hepburn: \"Akira\") is a 1988 Japanese animated post-apocalyptic cyberpunk film directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, produced by Ryōhei Suzuki and Shunzō Katō, and written by Otomo and Izo Hashimoto, based on Otomo's manga of the same name. The film had a production budget of (), making it the most expensive anime film of its time.\n\nSet in a dystopian 2019, \"Akira\" tells the story of Shōtarō Kaneda, a leader of a local biker gang whose childhood friend, Tetsuo Shima, acquires incredible telekinetic abilities after a motorcycle accident, eventually threatening an entire military complex amidst chaos and rebellion in the sprawling futuristic metropolis of Neo-Tokyo. While most of the character designs and settings were adapted from the manga, the plot differs considerably and removes much of the last half of the manga.\n\n\"Akira\" premiered in Japan on 16 July 1988 by Toho, and was released the following year in the United States by pioneering animation distributor Streamline Pictures. It garnered an international cult following following its theatrical release, and eventually grossed over $80million worldwide through its theatrical and VHS releases. It is widely considered by many critics to be one of the greatest animated and science fiction films of all time, as well as a landmark in Japanese animation. It is also a landmark film in the cyberpunk genre, particularly the Japanese cyberpunk subgenre, as well as adult animation. The film had a significant impact on popular culture worldwide, paving the way for the growth of anime and Japanese popular culture in the Western world as well as influencing numerous works in animation, comics, film, music, television and video games.\n\nIn July 1988, a blinding white singularity destroys Tokyo, resulting in World War III. By the 21st century, however, peace has been achieved.\n\nBy 2019, Tokyo, now called “Neo-Tokyo,” has been rebuilt, but is plagued by corruption, anti-government protests and terrorism, and gang violence. One night, during a large protest, the hot-headed Shōtarō Kaneda leads his vigilante bōsōzoku gang, the Capsules, against their rivals, the Clowns. During this mission, Kaneda's best friend, Tetsuo Shima, inadvertently crashes his motorcycle into Takashi, a psychic esper who recently escaped from a government laboratory with the aid of a resistance organization. The accident awakens psychic powers in Tetsuo, attracting the attention of a secret government project directed by Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) Colonel Shikishima. Assisted by esper Masaru, Shikishima recaptures Takashi, takes the injured Tetsuo with him, and arrests Kaneda and his gang. While being interrogated by the police, he meets Kei, an activist belonging to the resistance movement, and tricks the authorities into releasing her along with his gang, taking an interest in her. \n\nShikishima and his head of research, Doctor Ōnishi discover that Tetsuo possesses powerful psychic abilities similar to Akira, the esper responsible for Tokyo's destruction. Meanwhile, Takashi's fellow esper, Kiyoko, forewarns Shikishima of Neo-Tokyo's impending destruction. Neo-Tokyo's parliament, however, dismisses Shikishima's concerns, so he considers killing Tetsuo in order to prevent another cataclysm. Meanwhile, Tetsuo escapes from the hospital, steals Kaneda's motorcycle, and prepares to run away from Neo-Tokyo with his girlfriend Kaori, but the Clowns ambush them, prompting the Capsules to intervene. While the Capsules are apprehending them, Tetsuo suffers headaches and hallucinations, and is taken back to the hospital. Searching for answers about Tetsuo, Kaneda finds Kei and joins her resistance cell after overhearing their plan to rescue Tetsuo and the other espers. At the hospital, the espers unsuccessfully attempt to confront and control Tetsuo as he aggressively fights back with his psychokinetic powers, which make him egomaniacal and unstable, and escapes again. Meanwhile, Kaneda, Kei, and the resistance group infiltrate the hospital and find themselves drawn into Shikishima and the espers' attempt to stop Tetsuo. He overpowers them all and leaves the hospital after learning from Kiyoko that he can gain help from Akira, located in cryonic storage beneath the Olympic Stadium's construction site.\n\nUsing Kei as a medium, Kiyoko and Kaneda escape military custody in the hope of stopping Tetsuo, while Shikishima stages a coup d'état against the Neo-Tokyo government and directs all of its military forces to destroy Tetsuo. Returning to the Capsules' former hangout to obtain drugs to control his powers, Tetsuo murders his old gang member, Yamagata; upon discovering his death, Kaneda vows to avenge him by searching for Tetsuo. Tetsuo rampages through Neo-Tokyo, eventually arriving at Akira's cryogenic storage dewar in the stadium. Kiyoko has Kei fight Tetsuo, but he easily defeats her and exhumes Akira's remains which were dissected, and preserved for future studies. Using a laser rifle, Kaneda fights Tetsuo in a duel; meanwhile, Shikishima fires an orbital weapon at him but is unsuccessful. \n\nShikishima and Kaori approach the stadium where Tetsuo is hiding out at in great pain and losing control over his powers. Shikishima offers Tetsuo to return to the hospital and help with his injuries and pain, and to help him control his abilities, while Kaori attempts to restrain Tetsuo. However, Kaneda arrives and duels with Tetsuo once again. Losing control of his powers, Tetsuo mutates into a gigantic mass consuming all matter, engulfing Kaneda and killing Kaori. As the mass continues to grow, the espers decide to awaken Akira as the only way to stop it. After reuniting with his friends, Akira creates another singularity that draws Tetsuo and Kaneda into another dimension. The espers teleport Shikishima to a safe distance as the singularity destroys Neo-Tokyo in a mirror of Tokyo's previous destruction, and they agree to rescue Kaneda, knowing that they will not be able to return to this dimension. \n\nIn the singularity, Kaneda experiences Tetsuo's and the espers' childhood, including Tetsuo's dependence on Kaneda during their childhood, and how the children were trained and altered before Tokyo's destruction. The espers return Kaneda to his world, informing him that Akira will take Tetsuo to safety and that Kei is developing psychic powers. The singularity suddenly disappears and water floods the city's remains. In the aftermath, Kaneda discovers that Kei and Kai have survived, and they drive off into the ruins, while Shikishima watches the sunrise. Finally in control of his powers, Tetsuo triggers a big bang to create a parallel universe as God.\n\nWhile working on the \"Akira\" comic, Katsuhiro Otomo did not intend to adapt the series outside of the manga; however, he became \"very intrigued\" when the offer to develop his work for the screen was put before him. He agreed to an anime film adaptation of the series on the grounds that he retained creative control of the project — this insistence was based on his experiences working on \"Harmagedon\". The Akira Committee was the name given to a partnership of several major Japanese entertainment companies brought together to realize production of an \"Akira\" film. The group's assembly was necessitated by the unconventionally high budget of around ¥1,100,000,000, intended to achieve the desired epic standard equal to Otomo's over 2,000-page manga tale. The committee consisted of Kodansha, Mainichi Broadcasting System, Bandai, Hakuhodo, Toho, Laserdisc Corporation and Sumitomo Corporation who all forwarded money and promotion towards the film. The animation for the film was provided for by animation producers, Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now TMS Entertainment).\n\nAt the time, most anime were notorious for cutting production corners with limited animation, such as having only the characters' mouths move with basic lip sync while their faces remained static. \"Akira\" broke from this trend with detailed scenes, pre-scored dialogue (wherein the dialogue is recorded before the film starts production and the movements of the characters' lips are animated to match it; a first for an anime production, although the voice actors did perform with the aid of animatics), and super-fluid motion as realized in the film's more than 160,000 animation cels. Computer-generated imagery was also used in the film (created by High-Tech Lab. Japan Inc. and the cooperative companies for computer graphics, Sumisho Electronic Systems, Inc. and Wavefront Technologies), primarily to animate the pattern indicator used by Doctor Ōnishi, but it was additionally used to plot the paths of falling objects, model parallax effects on backgrounds, and tweak lighting and lens flares. Unlike its live-action predecessors, \"Akira\" also had the budget to show a fully realized futuristic Tokyo. The film's production budget was (), making it the most expensive anime film of its time.\n\nThe teaser trailer for \"Akira\" was released in 1987. The film's main production was completed in 1987, with sound recording and mixing performed in early 1988. It was released in 1988, two years before the manga officially ended in 1990. Otomo is claimed to have filled 2,000 pages of notebooks, containing various ideas and character designs for the film, but the final storyboard consisted of a trimmed-down 738 pages. He had great difficulty completing the manga; Otomo has stated that the inspiration for its conclusion arose from a conversation that he had with Alejandro Jodorowsky in 1990. He later recalled that the film project had to begin with the writing of an ending that would bring suitable closure to major characters, storylines, and themes without being extraordinarily lengthy, so that he could know in reverse order which manga elements would make the cut into the anime and thus suitably resolve the manga's various elements into a lean, two-hour story.\n\nOtomo is a big fan of \"Tetsujin 28-go\". As a result, his naming conventions match the characters featured in \"Tetsujin 28-go\": Kaneda shares his name with the protagonist of \"Tetsujin 28-go\"; Colonel Shikishima shares his name with Professor Shikishima of \"Tetsujin 28-go\", while Tetsuo is named after Shikishima's son Tetsuo Shikishima; \"Akira\"s Ryūsaku is named after Ryūsaku Murasame. In addition, Takashi has a \"26\" tattooed on his hand which closely resembles the font used in \"Tetsujin 28-go\". The namesake of the series, \"Akira\", is the 28th in a line of psychics that the government has developed, the same number as \"Tetsujin-28\".\n\n\"Akira\" was released by Toho on 16 July 1988. Fledgling North American distribution company Streamline Pictures soon acquired an existing English-language rendition created by Electric Media Inc. for Kodansha, which saw limited release in North American theaters on 25 December 1989. Streamline became the film's distributor. In the UK, \"Akira\" was theatrically released by Island Visual Arts on 25 January 1991, and was re-released on 13 July 2013 celebrating the 25th anniversary of the film and again on 21 September 2016. In Australia, \"Akira\" was theatrically released by Ronin Films. In Canada, the Streamline dub was released by Lionsgate (at the time known as C/FP Distribution), who would eventually become Manga Entertainment's owner through their media operating unit Starz Distribution, in 1990. In 2001, Pioneer released a new English dub which was produced by Animaze and ZRO Limit Productions and was presented in select theaters from March through December 2001. GKIDS later announced that it would distribute the film within North America, with a theatrical release scheduled for December 2018.\n\nVHS releases included the initial Streamline Video offering (May 1991), later wider distribution by MGM/UA Home Video, and a subtitled edition from Orion Home Video (September 1993). In the UK, \"Akira\" was released on video by Island World Communications in 1991. The film went on to gross over $80million worldwide from its theatrical and VHS releases. The success of this release led to the creation of Manga Entertainment, who later took over the release. The original VHS release of \"Akira\" started up Manga Entertainment Australia and VHS distribution was handled by Ronin Films and PolyGram until 1994 when Siren Entertainment took over all of Manga Entertainment Australia's distribution including \"Akira\" under a special license from PolyGram, who handled Island's video distribution. \"Akira\" was re-released on video in 1994, and again on DVD in 2001 and distributed by Madman Entertainment and The AV Channel. Pioneer Entertainment issued a DVD and a VHS with a new English dub (the dub produced by Animaze) in 2001. This was one of the few releases from Geneon to feature THX-certified audio and video. In 2002, Manga released a two-disc DVD featuring the new Pioneer/Animaze English dub followed in 2004 by another two-disc set containing the original Japanese as well as both the Streamline and Pioneer/Animaze dubs. This version did not contain standard English subtitles, only closed captioning subtitles. In 2005, Manga Entertainment and Boulevard UMD released \"Akira\" on UMD for the Sony PSP in the United Kingdom using the original Streamline dub.\n\nIn 1992, video-distribution company the Criterion Collection, which specializes in licensing \"important classic and contemporary films\", released a LaserDisc edition of \"Akira\". The release is notable in that \"Akira\" is the first animated film to be released by Criterion and for more than twenty years their sole animated film to be released until their 2014 Blu-ray/DVD release of \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" (2009).\n\nA Blu-ray disc edition of the film was released on 24 February 2009 in North America by Bandai Entertainment under the Honneamise label. A Blu-ray edition of \"Akira\" was subsequently released in Australia by Madman Entertainment under exclusive license from Manga Entertainment UK and Kodansha. Madman has recently released a DVD/Blu-ray combo which license is separate from the standalone Blu-ray release because instead of the DVD version being the Manga Video UK version, it uses Madman/Manga's 2001 Special Edition DVD release which is licensed from Manga UK. The Blu-ray release is the very first to use the highest sampling rate currently possible (Japanese Dolby TrueHD 192 kHz because of its analog roots) and is also the first to use the hypersonic effect (only available in this track and via a high-end audio system). As well as Japanese with English subtitles, the Blu-ray also features the 2001 Pioneer/Animaze English dub (Dolby TrueHD 48 kHz). The DVD version of \"Akira\" has been re-released in 2012 by Bandai Entertainment. The film was licensed again by Funimation following Bandai Entertainment's closure shortly after its DVD release. The Funimation release includes both the Streamline and Pioneer dubs. Funimation released the 25th anniversary Blu-ray/DVD combo and separate DVD release on 12 November 2013, which contain both English dubs. Best Buy released a limited edition exclusive Blu-ray Steelbook the same year.\n\nThe Streamline dub version first premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel in the 1990s during their week-long anime events and \"Saturday Anime\" block.The Pioneer dub of the film has aired twice on Adult Swim's Toonami block, once on 7 December 2013, with a rating of TV-MA-V, and again on 20 December 2014, both times with explicit language and nudity censored. It has aired numerous times on Australian FTA station SBS.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval score of 87% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Akira\" is distractingly bloody and violent, but its phenomenal animation and sheer kinetic energy helped set the standard for modern anime.\"\n\nAnime News Network's Bamboo Dong commends the Limited Edition's DVD for its \"superbly translated\" English subtitles and the commendable English dubbing, which \"sticks very close to the English translation, and the voice actors deliver their lines with emotion\". THEM Anime's Raphael See applauds the film's \"astounding special effects and clean, crisp animation\". Chris Beveridge comments on the Japanese audio, which brings \"the forward soundstage nicely into play when required. Dialogue is well placed, with several key moments of directionality used perfectly\". Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" commends Otomo's artwork, stating \"the drawings of Neo-Tokyo by night are so intricately detailed that all the individual windows of huge skyscrapers appear distinct. And these night scenes glow with subtle, vibrant color\". Richard Harrison of \"The Washington Post\" comments on the pace of the film, stating that the author \"has condensed the narrative sprawl of the comics to provide coherence, though there's a bit of \"Back to the Future Part II\" incompleteness to the story. That hardly matters, since the film moves with such kinetic energy that you'll be hanging on for dear life\".\n\n\"Variety\" commends the film's \"imaginative and detailed design of tomorrow to the booming Dolby effects on the soundtrack\" but criticizes the \"slight stiffness in the drawing of human movement\". Kim Newman of \"Empire\" commends the film's \"scintillating animated visuals, with not one – not one – computer-assisted shot in sight\". \"Chicago Tribune\"s Dave Kehr commends Otomo's \"excellent animation-specific ideas: Vehicles leave little color trails as they roar through the night, and there are a number of dream sequences that make nice use of the medium`s ability to confound scale and distort perspective\". Helen McCarthy in \"500 Essential Anime Movies\" claims that the anime \"remains fresh and exciting, easily holding its own against the products of two decades of massive technical advancement\". Meanwhile, in February 2004, Dan Persons of \"Cinefantastique\" listed the film as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\", simply referring to the film as \"the film that changed everything.\"\n\n\"Akira\" is now widely regarded as one of the greatest animated movies of all time and prompted an increase in popularity of anime movies in the US and, generally, outside Japan. It is still admired for its exceptional visuals. In Channel 4's 2005 poll of the 100 greatest animations of all time featuring both film and television, \"Akira\" came in at number 16. On \"Empire\" magazine's list of the 500 greatest movies of all time, \"Akira\" is number 440. It showed again on \"Empire\"s list of The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema, coming in at #51. IGN also named it 14th on its list of Top 25 Animated Movies of All-Time. The \"Akira\" anime also made \"TIME\" magazine's list of top 5 anime DVDs. The film also made number 16 on \"Time Out\"s top 50 animated movie list and number 5 on the \"Total Film\" Top 50 Animated Films list. The film was ranked #1 by \"Wizard's Anime\" magazine on their \"Top 50 Anime released in North America\" list in 2001. It was ranked #4 on \"The Hollywood Reporter\" critic's list of \"10 Best Animated Films for Adults\" in 2016. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" selected \"Akira\" as his \"Video Pick of the Week\" in 1992 on \"Siskel & Ebert and the Movies\". For its wider 2001 release, he gave the film \"Thumbs Up.\"\n\n\"Akira\" has also been regarded as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. It was ranked number 22 on \"The Guardian\"s list of best sci-fi and fantasy films, included on Film4's list of top 50 science fiction films, and ranked number 27 on \"Complex\" magazine's list of 50 best sci-fi movies. Phelim O'Neill of \"The Guardian\" draws a parallel on \"Akira\"s influence on the science-fiction genre to \"Blade Runner\" and Stanley Kubrick's \"\". \"Akira\" is considered a landmark film in the cyberpunk genre, particularly the Japanese cyberpunk subgenre. \"Akira\" is also credited as a breakthrough for adult animation, proving to global audiences that animation was not just for children.\n\n\"Akira\" is regarded by many critics as a landmark anime film, one that influenced much of the art in the anime world that followed its release with many illustrators in the manga industry citing the film as an important influence. Manga author Masashi Kishimoto, for example, recalls becoming fascinated with the way the poster was made and wished to imitate the series' creator Katsuhiro Otomo's style. The film had a significant impact on popular culture worldwide. The film led the way for the growth in popularity of anime outside Japan as well as Japanese popular culture in the Western world. \"Akira\" is considered a forerunner of the second wave of anime fandom that began in the early 1990s and has gained a massive cult following since then. It is credited with setting the scene for anime franchises such as \"Pokémon\", \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Naruto\" to become global cultural phenomena.\n\n\"Akira\" has influenced numerous works in animation, comics, film, music, television and video games. It inspired a wave of Japanese cyberpunk works, including manga and anime series such as \"Ghost in the Shell\", \"Battle Angel Alita\", \"Cowboy Bebop\", and \"Serial Experiments Lain\", live-action Japanese films such as \"\", and video games such as Hideo Kojima's \"Snatcher\" and \"Metal Gear Solid\". Outside of Japan, \"Akira\" has been cited as a major influence on Hollywood films such as \"The Matrix\", \"Dark City\", \"Kill Bill\", \"Chronicle\", \"Looper\", \"The Dark Knight\", \"Midnight Special\", and \"Inception\", television shows such as \"Stranger Things\", and video games such as Valve's \"Half-Life\" series and Dontnod Entertainment's \"Remember Me\". John Gaeta cited \"Akira\" as artistic inspiration for the bullet time effect in \"The Matrix\" films. \"Akira\" has also been credited with influencing the \"Star Wars\" franchise, including the prequel film trilogy and the \"Clone Wars\" film and television series. Todd McFarlane cited \"Akira\" as an influence on HBO animated television series \"Spawn\". \"Akira\" has also influenced the work of musicians such as Kanye West, who paid homage to \"Akira\" in the \"Stronger\" music video, and Lupe Fiasco, whose album \"Tetsuo & Youth\" is named after Tetsuo Shima. The popular bike from the film, Kaneda's Motorbike, appears in \"Steven Spielberg\"'s film \"Ready Player One\", and CD Projekt's video game \"Cyberpunk 2077\". \"\" video game developer Eidos Montréal also paid homage to the film's poster.\n\nWhen Tokyo was chosen to host the 2020 Summer Olympics in the 2013 bidding process, several commentators claimed that \"Akira\" predicted the future event.\n\n\"Akira\" was one of the four nominees for the 2007 American Anime Awards' \"Best Anime Feature\" award, but it lost to \"\".\n\nJohnny Yong Bosch, Kaneda's voice actor in the Pioneer English dub, was nominated for Best Actor and Best Actor in a Comedy at American Anime Awards, but lost to fellow \"Naruto\" and \"\" voice actors Vic Mignogna and Dave Wittenberg, respectively.\n\n\"AKIRA: Original Soundtrack\" (\"Symphonic Suite AKIRA\") was recorded by Geinō Yamashirogumi (芸能山城組). The music was composed and conducted by musical director Shōji Yamashiro (pseudonym of Tsutomu Ōhashi). It features music which was additionally re-recorded for release. \"Kaneda\", \"Battle Against Clown\" and \"Exodus From the Underground Fortress\" are really part of the same song cycle — elements of \"Battle Against Clown\" can be heard during the opening bike sequence, for example. The score is generally sequenced in the same order that the music occurs in the film. The North American version featured extensive production notes by David Keith Riddick and Robert Napton.\n\n\"AKIRA: The Original Japanese Soundtrack\"; an alternate soundtrack was also released. This version included music as it appeared in the film with dialogue and sound-effects albeit ordered out of sequence.\n\nThe soundtrack spawned an album of electronica remixes from Bwana, called \"Capsules Pride\".\n\nIn 1988, Taito released an \"Akira\" adventure game for the Famicom exclusively in Japan. Another \"Akira\" game for the Atari Jaguar, Super NES, Genesis and Sega CD was being developed, but cancelled along with prospects of another \"Akira\" title for the Game Boy and Game Gear handheld consoles. International Computer Entertainment produced a video game based on \"Akira\" for the Amiga and Amiga CD32 in 1994. To coincide with the DVD release in 2002, Bandai released \"Akira Psycho Ball\", a pinball simulator for the PlayStation 2.\n\nIn 2002, Warner Bros. acquired the rights to create a live-action remake of \"Akira\" as a seven-figure deal. However, the live-action remake has undergone several failed attempts to produce it, with at least five different directors and ten different writers known to have been attached to it. The directors have had some freedom with the project; according to writer Gary Whitta who had written one draft of a live-action screenplay, they have been told that Otomo had instructed those working on the film \"basically to not be afraid to change things, that he wanted to see an original and different interpretation, not just a straight-up remake\". Otomo himself said in a June 2017 interview that as he is \"basically done with \"Akira\"\" as a manga, that \"if someone wants to do something new with \"Akira\" then I am mostly okay with that\", with the only condition that he can review and approve of any scenario a writer might take it for a live-action film.\n\n\"IGN\" concluded that long-term troubles with producing the live-action film come from two areas. First, there has been the fear of whitewashing or racebending, casting American or other Western actors in lieu of Japanese ones, which has come to light when various actors have been named for roles. Secondly, \"Akira\" itself is not a story that is easy to relocate outside of Japan, due to the influence on the original story of Japan's role in World War II, including the atomic bombings of Japan, and their own Unit 731.\n\nShortly after Warner Bros. acquired the rights, Stephen Norrington was slated to direct with James Robinson writing the screenplay and Dan Lin producing. Norrington had planned to make the remake more appealing to Western audiences, making Kaneda and Tetsuo brothers. Following the commercial failure of \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" in 2003, which both Norrington and Robinson were also on, the project was put on hold.\n\nDirector Ruairi Robinson announced in 2008 he was teaming with Whitta to adopt the manga for live-action, breaking the narrative out over two films with the first to have been completed and released by 2009. Producer Andrew Lazar said that the first film would cover volumes 1 through 3 of the manga, with the rest covered in the second film. Whitta, in a 2015 interview, said that the story would have taken place in a Japan-owned Manhattan, renaming the region as New Tokyo. This would allow them to have used a mix of Western and Asian actors as to avoid concerns that they would be whitewashing the project.\n\nRuairi Robinson left the project in 2009 and was replaced by directors Allen and Albert Hughes, though later Albert Hughes went solo with the project by 2011. They used Whitta's script with modifications by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby with an aim for a PG-13 rating. Around 2011, a version of the \"Akira\" script leaked online; though it was unclear if this was Whitta's or Fergus/Ostby's version, the scripts deviated significantly from the source material in what was considered a negative way according to \"IGN\", such as making Akira a \"psychotic murderous creepy child\", inclusion of heavy-handed references to the September 11 attacks, and characters written in a misogynistic fashion. Around this same time, casting calls for the film led to accusations of whitewashing. Shortly after these events, Albert Hugest left the project citing \"amicable creative differences\".\n\nSince the project began, several writers, directors (including George Miller and Christopher Nolan), producers, actors and actresses have been attached to the project.\n\nGeorge Takei spoke with \"The Advocate\" in April 2011 about the casting rumors at that time, stating that any decision to cast white actors in \"Akira\" would offend both Asians and the fans of the original manga or animated film.\n\nAs of 14 July 2014, the latest writer known to be working on the script was Dante Harper.\n\nOn 8 March 2015, the planned director Jaume Collet-Serra told Collider in an interview that there was no progress on the film and planned to take a break from directing. However, the studio might get the film made eventually. On 8 June 2015, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" has reported that the studio has resumed work on the film and Marco Ramirez, known for his work as one of the showrunners for Marvel's \"Daredevil\", will write the film. Warner Bros. offered George Miller the chance to direct the film at one point but he turned it down due to commitments to other projects. According to Jeff Sneider at Meet the Movie Press, the studio is in talks with Justin Lin to direct the film. After the success of \"Get Out\", Jordan Peele was offered the director's chair but passed on it.\n\nIn January 2016, Katsuhiro Otomo revealed in a French comic festival that an anime television series was being considered.\n\nIn September 2017, it was announced director Taika Waititi was in talks to possibly be the director for a live-action adaptation. Waititi later revealed his intent to keep the ethnicity of the characters intact. Also, Waititi expressed interest in casting untapped teenaged talent. \n\n"}
{"id": "41910273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41910273", "title": "American Ultra", "text": "American Ultra\n\nAmerican Ultra is a 2015 American action comedy film directed by Nima Nourizadeh and written by Max Landis. The film stars Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Topher Grace, Connie Britton, Walton Goggins, John Leguizamo, Bill Pullman, and Tony Hale. It was released on August 21, 2015, by Lionsgate.\n\nMike Howell is a stoner who lives in the sleepy town of Liman, West Virginia, where he works as a convenience store clerk. He is planning to propose to his longtime girlfriend, Phoebe Larson, on a trip to Hawaii. However, due to a fear of travel, he suffers intense panic attacks and is unable to board the plane. It is revealed he has had similar issues trying to leave town in the past and does not understand why Phoebe is so nice about it.\n\nIn Langley, Virginia, CIA Agent Victoria Lasseter receives a coded warning that Mike, the sole survivor of her “Wiseman” Ultra program, is to be eliminated by her rival, Adrian Yates, and his similar “Toughguy” agents. Feeling a duty to protect Mike, Lasseter travels to Liman and \"activates\" Mike through a series of code words. Mike fails to understand their significance, and she leaves in resigned frustration.\n\nMike finds two Toughguys planting a bomb in his car and is attacked, but his training activates and he quickly kills them. Horrified, he calls Phoebe, who reaches him just as Sheriff Watts arrives. Yates sends two Toughguy operatives, Laugher and Crane, to kill Mike and Phoebe at the sheriff station, but they evade Laugher and kill Crane before escaping to the home of Mike's drug dealing friend Rose. Mike becomes unnerved by an array of facts he suddenly knows regarding military strategy. He also realises he has very little memory prior to living in the town with Phoebe, wondering aloud why he never questioned this before.\n\nYates places the city under quarantine, and puts Lasseter and Mike's pictures on the local news. Lasseter contacts her former assistant, Petey Douglas, to air drop her a weapon. Yates finds out and threatens Petey with charges of treason, causing Peter to deny her further help. Yates then attacks Rose's house with two Toughguys using a lethal gas. The agents kill Rose and his two guards, Big Harold and Wuinzin, before Mike and Phoebe kill the attackers and she rescues Mike from the gas, which she is familiar with. When pressed for answers on her knowledge of the gas, Phoebe reluctantly reveals she was a CIA agent assigned to be Mike's handler, leaving him heartbroken.\n\nLaugher ambushes the duo and captures Phoebe. Mike is rescued by Lasseter and insists on returning to his house. She tells him that he volunteered for Wiseman due to his criminal record and subsequently had his memories erased. He also learns that Phoebe was to get him settled in Liman and then leave, but chose to stay because she legitimately fell in love. Lasseter also explains that his phobias, including his fear of leaving town, were implanted to keep him safe.\n\nYates’ army liaison, Otis, joins a Toughguy to attack Mike’s house. Mike and Lasseter kill them, prompting Yates to order a drone strike on the entire block. Petey launches the drone but eventually refuses to fire its missile, then secretly reports the situation to Yates' superior, Raymond Krueger.\n\nMike contacts Yates and arranges to exchange himself for Phoebe at a local grocery store. He attacks the store, killing or incapacitating multiple Toughguys before fighting and defeating Laugher, whom he spares when Mike learns he is a mentally unbalanced man forcibly conscripted by Yates. Phoebe escapes from Yates when Lasseter attacks him, but Krueger arrives and stops her.\n\nPhoebe and Mike leave the store under gunpoint of multiple law enforcement officers, before whom he proposes to her.\n\nIn a forested area, Krueger has Yates and Lasseter bound and kneeling. Yates argues that what he was doing would have been okay with Krueger, despite the deaths of seven innocent sheriffs, if the results had been successful, and Krueger agrees. Yates, missing the “successful” codicil, smugly smiles and stands, but is executed by Krueger. Krueger admits he informed Lasseter of Yates’ plan, and she points out that, by taking out 17 Toughguys, Mike is proof of the success of her Wiseman program.\n\nSix months later, handled by Lasseter and Petey, Mike and Phoebe are in Manila, confident and happy together as they carry out a CIA assignment.\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 14, 2014 in New Orleans and wrapped in mid-June.\n\nOn November 21, 2013, Apsara Distribution announced that they had acquired the rights to distribute the film outside the United States. On March 1, 2014, Lionsgate announced their acquisition of the North American rights to the film. On April 30, 2015, Lionsgate set an August 21, 2015, release date for the film.\n\nThe film was released on August 21, 2015, by Lionsgate. This is the first film to be released with a DTS:X soundtrack.\n\nThe first still and two teaser posters were released on May 14, 2015 by MTV. The red band trailer was released by Yahoo! Movies on May 28, 2015.\n\n\"American Ultra\" grossed $14,439,985 in North America and $15,855,091 in other territories for a worldwide total of $30,295,076, against a budget of $28 million. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $5.5 million, finishing sixth at the box office and third among the week's new releases, behind \"Sinister 2\" ($10.5 million) and \"\" ($8.3 million). Landis criticized the film's poor box office performance on his Twitter, stating, \n\n\"American Ultra\" received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 43%, based on 148 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"American Ultra\" has some interesting ideas, but like its stoned protagonist, it's too easily distracted to live up to its true potential.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 50 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". CinemaScore announced that audiences gave the film an average grade of \"B–\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nMark Kermode of \"The Guardian\" gave the film two out of five stars, stating \"Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart brave an anarchic mish-mash with lots of violence but few laughs.\" David Dishman of the \"McAlester News-Capital\" writes \"\"American Ultra\" promoted itself under the slogan, \"There is nothing more dangerous than a stoned cold killer,\" and while they may be right, there's also nothing spectacular about that stoned cold killer's movie.\"\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" awarded the film two of four stars: \"Soon the movie's twisty charm gives way to gory splatter. Eisenberg and Stewart stay appealing to the last. The movie, not so much.\" Neil Genzlinger from \"The New York Times\" gave the film a mixed review, ending with \"A lot of it seems familiar, and Mr. Eisenberg and Ms. Stewart aren’t stretched much. But Mike finds amusing ways to defend himself using ordinary household items, Walton Goggins and John Leguizamo enliven things in goofy small roles, the plot has a nice twist or two, and your theater is probably air-conditioned.\"\n\nLandis discussed the negative critical and box office performance of the movie and its misleading marketing campaign in an interview with RedLetterMedia.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2633923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2633923", "title": "Art methodology", "text": "Art methodology\n\nArt methodology refers to a \"studied\" and constantly reassessed, questioned method within the arts, as opposed to a method merely applied (without thought). This process of studying the method and reassessing its effectiveness allows art to move on and change. It is not the thing itself but it is an essential part of the process. \n\nAn artist drawing, for instance, may choose to draw from what he or she observes in front of them, or from what they \"imagine\" or from what they already know about the subject. These 3 methods will, very probably, produce 3 very different pictures. A careful methodology would include examination of the materials and tools used and how a different type of canvas/brush/paper/pencil/rag/camera/chisel etc. would produce a different effect. The artist may also look at various effects achieved by starting in one part of a canvas first, or by working over the whole surface equally. An author may experiment with stream of consciousness writing, as opposed to naturalistic narrative, or a combination of styles.\n\nIn stark contrast to fine art practice is the traditional craft form. With traditional crafts, the method is handed down from generation to generation with often very little change in techniques. It is usually fair to say that folk crafts employ a method but not an art methodology, since that would involve rigorous questioning and criticising of the tradition.\n\nAn art methodology differs from a science methodology, perhaps mainly insofar as the artist is not always after the same goal as the scientist. In art it is not necessarily all about establishing the exact truth so much as making the most effective form (painting, drawing, poem, novel, performance, sculpture, video, etc.) through which ideas, feelings, perceptions can be communicated to a public. With this purpose in mind, some artists will exhibit preliminary sketches and notes which were part of the process leading to the creation of a work. Sometimes, in Conceptual art, the preliminary process is the only part of the work which \"is\" exhibited, with no visible end result displayed. In such a case the \"journey\" is being presented as more important than the destination. Conceptual artist Robert Barry once put on an exhibition where the door of the gallery remained shut and a sign on the door informed visitors that the gallery would be closed for the exhibition. These kind of works question accepted concepts, such as that of having a tangible work of art as end result.\n\nThe Peace Through Art methodology developed by the International Child Art Foundation (ICAF) was recognized as a Stockholm Challenge Finalist for best practice and innovative initiative, in Stockholm, Sweden. ICAF's statement on the methodology of the programme says: \"the Peace Through Art methodology draws upon the creativity and imagination of young people, and teaches them the ethics of responsibility in this interdependent global village that has come to be our world. The methodology incorporates best practices from the fields of psychology, conflict resolution and peace education, while employing the power of the arts for self-expression, healing and communication.\"\n\nIn Art Therapy and other applied forms of art to the needs of groups within the community art methodology is built up in relation to other methodologies, such as that of psychotherapy. \n\nPauline Mottram SRAsTh, gave a short paper entitled \"“Towards developing a methodology to evaluate outcomes of Art Therapy in Adult Mental Illness.”\" for the October 2000 TAoAT Conference. Here's an excerpt: \n\n\"In addressing the effectiveness challenge and in seeking a means of measuring outcomes of the art therapy service that I deliver, I have sought a methodology that can provide a valid and reliable quantitative outcome, whilst still respecting the aesthetic and humanistic nature of art therapy practice. This endeavour is made all the more complex by the fact that art therapy lacks a fully developed theory and it has a fragile research base. Generally it is argued that art therapy is more compatible with qualitative research designs that encompass subjectivity, rather than quantitative objective methods. Kaplan (1998, p95) states that ‘Qualitative is exploratory and theory building. Quantitative tests hypothesis in order to refine and validate theory.’ She holds that art therapy cannot afford to reject either form of inquiry.\"\n\nIn \"The Methodology of Generative Art\" by Tjark Ihmels and Julia Riedel, an online article at Media Art Net Mozart's \"musical game of dice\" is cited as a precedent for the methodology of Generative art which, say the authors, has \"established itself in nearly every area of artistic practice (music, literature [3], the fine arts).\": \n\n\"Mozart composed 176 bars of music, from which sixteen were chosen from a list using dice, which then produced a new piece when performed on a piano. Sixteen bars, each with eleven possibilities, can result in 1,116 unique pieces of music. Using this historical example, the methodology of generative art can be appropriately described as the rigorous application of predefined principles of action for the intentional exclusion of, or substitution for, individual aesthetical decisions that sets in motion the generation of new artistic content out of material provided for that purpose.\" \n\n"}

Garnett and released exclusively in the United Kingdom as a paperback. It is written as a sub-sequel to an earlier story written by Garnett in 1994, entitled \"Stargonauts\", which features some of the same settings and characters from the first story.\n\nIn 1968, Las Vegas weakling cop Wayne Norton stumbles on a gangster plot by crime lord Mario to freeze himself and re-emerge as the Head of a large criminal empire in the future. After knocking Wayne unconscious, Mario freezes him instead and then kills his servants.\n\nWhile Wayne is frozen, Mario is caught and sentenced to 300 years imprisonment. Over the years, the world becomes heavily dependent on the Internet, and all books, videos etc., are recorded electronically. On Day Zero, the entire Internet crashes and all history and knowledge is wiped out. People eventually forget what they were taught, and learn from the past through old John Wayne films. Las Vegas is overrun by Red Indians, who leave many American cities to ruin.\n\nWaking in the 24th Century, Wayne claims to be John Wayne. He's appointed a GalactiCop Police Sergeant by his new employer, Colonel Travis. Unbeknownst to Norton, Travis sends Wayne as his double to Hideaway, the entertainment planet.\n\nOn the nearby prison planet Arazon (colloquially known as \"Clink\"), the female prisoner Kiru (a neurotic) falls into league with a band of space pirates planning to escape. The mute bodyguard Grawl decides to protect Kiru. He even kills his friend Aqa after he and Kiru have sex. Once she escapes and gets to Hideaway, Kiru gets away from Grawl. He had planned on transplanting all of her organs to keep himself going.\n\nWayne arrives on Hideaway and checks in as Robin Hood. He comes across a tailors' shop run by Janesmith, a princess-in-exile from the female-dominated planet of Algol. After identifying himself as Duke Wayne this time, Janesmith immediately has sex with him, thinking he's an aristocrat. Wayne is unwilling to continue, though, after discovering Janesmith has \"vagina dentata\", but she uses hypnosis to knock him out.\n\nWayne awakes up in his room alone, but a few seconds later Kiru comes rushing in to hide from Grawl. The two have sex and are then arrested, while still naked, by a band of amoeba aliens who have already captured the escaped space pirates. Both Wayne and Kiru escape the aliens' ship, but in different escape pods. Kiru ends up riding with Colonel Travis (under the false name of Eliot Ness) and Wayne ends up stuck with Grawl.\n\nBoth escape pods land on an unknown planet. While Kiru and Travis land safely, Grawl sacrifices himself to help Wayne escape before the pod floods in the alien sea. Wayne is rescued and learns from Travis that the planet is to be the new Las Vegas, in direct competition with Hideaway. It will be called either Cafe World or Vegas World. The inhabitants all wear bikinis for uniforms, even while construction is underway.\n\nThere are three alternate endings to the story. Two of which involve Kiru and Wayne marrying on Vegas / Cafe World, while the other involves a massacre of the characters by a resurrected Grawl.\n\n\"Stargonauts\" also featured the characters of Grawl and Janesmith, and ended on Hideaway. In the original story, Grawl worked as a bodyguard to media tycoon William Ewart, who was in his fifth marriage to Janesmith's sister, Marysmith (who is mentioned on several occasions in \"Bikini Planet\"). Bikini Planet picks up from where the story left off, with Janesmith left abandoned on Hideaway whilst Grawl and Ewart became space pirates and presumably ended up on Arazon together.\n"}
{"id": "1371321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1371321", "title": "Cloisonnism", "text": "Cloisonnism\n\nCloisonnism is a style of post-Impressionist painting with bold and flat forms separated by dark contours. The term was coined by critic Edouard Dujardin on the occasion of the Salon des Indépendants, in March 1888. Artists Émile Bernard, Louis Anquetin, Paul Gauguin, Paul Sérusier, and others started painting in this style in the late 19th century. The name evokes the technique of cloisonné, where wires (\"cloisons\" or \"compartments\") are soldered to the body of the piece, filled with powdered glass, and then fired. Many of the same painters also described their works as Synthetism, a closely related movement.\n\nIn \"The Yellow Christ\" (1889), often cited as a quintessential cloisonnist work, Gauguin reduced the image to areas of single colors separated by heavy black outlines. In such works he paid little attention to classical perspective and boldly eliminated subtle gradations of color—two of the most characteristic principles of post-Renaissance painting.\n\nThe cloisonnist separation of colors reflects an appreciation for discontinuity that is characteristic of Modernism.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38674164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38674164", "title": "Conjectural history", "text": "Conjectural history\n\nConjectural history is a type of historiography isolated in the 1790s by Dugald Stewart, who termed it \"theoretical or conjectural history\", as prevalent in the historians and early social scientists of the Scottish Enlightenment. As Stewart saw it, such history makes space for speculation about causes of events, by postulating natural causes that could have had such an effect. His concept was to be identified closely with the French terminology \"histoire raisonnée\", and the usage of \"natural history\" by David Hume in his work \"The Natural History of Religion\". It was related to \"philosophical history\", a broader-based kind of historical theorising, but concentrated on the early history of man in a type of rational reconstruction that had little contact with evidence.\n\nSuch conjectural history was the antithesis of the narrative history being written at the time by Edward Gibbon and William Robertson. Stewart defended it as more universal in its application to humankind, even at the cost of detailed documentation. It was not concerned with the political narrative and public life, but saw itself as an investigative \"moral science\". General philosophical history was somewhat closer to narrative history than conjectural history could be, with its reliance in part on tenuous arguments on the nature of feudalism and early ethnographical reports from European travellers. For Stewart the \"Dissertation on the Origin of Languages\" by Adam Smith was an important example. To justify the procedures of conjectural history, there needed to be an assumption of the uniformity of human nature, or as Stewart put it, the \"capacities of the human mind\".\n\nConjectural history has been identified as \"the core of a theory\" of progress within Scottish philosophical history of the period. Pocock writes that Scottish conjectural history was \"of considerable importance to Gibbon and the creation of philosophical historiography\". By the 1780s there were European historians of culture who worked in a different way, preferring an inductive method to the pure deductions of conjectural history. In the later development of anthropology and archaeology, opposition to the whole \"conjectural history\" tradition led to the development of culture history.\n\nThere was nothing new in the idea of stages of society on its own, but social thinking itself was changing in Early Modern Europe, particularly on civil society in its components, civility and \"society\".\n\nHodgen comments, in a chapter \"From Hierarchy to History\", on the widespread use of \"conjectural series\" for historical explanation in the Early Modern period. The great chain of being was a static idea. \"Stage series\" had roots in classical thought, but might be associated with cyclic models, or incorporate ideas of decline with those of progress. She writes that in time\n\n... it seems certain that hierarchical ideas, temporalized to suit the needs of the conjectural historian of culture, were mixed with historical assumptions concerning the savage as a conjectural first member of these conjectural series. \n\nWhile the \"Natural History\" of Pliny the Elder was a classical Roman encyclopedic work, \"natural history\" had several different meanings in the Early Modern period. The one relevant in this article is the Baconian natural history, i.e. a systematic collection of observable information on natural phenomena. A natural history did not belong to natural philosophy, which was theoretical.\n\nThe \"histoire raisonnée\" was a genre of historical writing developed in France in the 17th century, with concerns for the individual in social context, and the description of culture and customs as integral to history. It grew out of humanist historiography with its close relationship to classical Roman and Greek models, but brought to the surface social matters, in particular as they could explain the motivations of individuals. With Géraud de Cordemoy there came an interest in causality as playing a part in historical movement, as distinct from the humanist acceptance of personal fates being subject to Fortune.\n\nContemporary terminology is stadial history, or in other words the discussion of stages of society by theoretical means (see sociocultural evolution#Stadial theory). Stadial theory as an innovation is attributed to the jurist Samuel Pufendorf. Grotius had already used conjectural history to discuss Aquinas on private property.\n\nSome basic conjectural history on human civilization was therefore discussed in the 17th century. Later Jean-Jacques Rousseau rejected the concept of the state of nature, and with Count Buffon debated the rise of civilization. The Scottish contribution then took the theory to a new level, with its anthropocentrism and detailed explanations of human manipulation of nature. It laid emphasis on a typical society at its beginnings, regarding evidence from contemporary reports (particularly of Native Americans) as valid.\n\nAdam Smith in lectures on rhetoric, given from 1748, advanced a speculative history of language; he wrote that he had been prompted by a 1747 work of Gabriel Girard. He was then interested in our awareness of literary style. This is the example that Dugald Stewart took up in coining the phrase \"conjectural history\". Elements would have been recognised at the time as drawing on the Bible, and in classical literature Lucretius; it is now considered Smith was influenced by Montesquieu on law and government. The theory on language and its typology over time has been seen as typical of Smith's historical approach; and even the foundation of his later well-known work on political economy. Caveats have also been entered, by David Raphael: it cannot be stretched to Smith's history of astronomy; and the term can be seen as a misnomer.\n\nMonboddo, on the other hand, wrote at length a conjectural history of language because he emphasised the history of manners. William Warburton had proposed a stadial conjectural history of writing in his \"Divine Legation of Moses\", a work supporting biblical authority, around 1740. It was taken up in France after the translation in \"Essai sur les hiéroglyphes des Égyptiens\". Where writing moved from pictograms to alphabets, he saw language use as having moved analogously from gestures to forms and figures of speech.\n\nThe term \"conjectural history\" was not generally accepted in Stewart's time. There was an orthodox four stages theory of society, the stages being:\n\n\nThis ladder-like ordering was taken to be a strict, linear progression, or unilineal evolution. Some economic determinism applied, in the sense that the baseline of subsistence was assumed to have a serious effect on social matters. The stages were supposed to represent progress on a moral level, as well as that of economic complexity. French as well as Scottish Enlightenment writers subscribed to such a pattern.\n\nThe invention of this type of theory (three or four stages) is attributed to a number of European writers from the 1750s onwards, such as Adam Smith, Turgot and Vico. In the Scottish context it appears in works from 1758 by David Dalrymple and Lord Kames; it has been argued that their source was the Edinburgh lectures of Smith on jurisprudence. In France it was published at much the same time, also, by Claude Pierre Goujet, Claude Adrien Helvétius, and François Quesnay. Smith's \"natural progress of opulence\" is a closely related theory.\n\nBesides Adam Smith, prominent Scottish authors in the field of conjectural history included Adam Ferguson, David Hume, Lord Kames, John Millar, and Lord Monboddo, writing from the later 1750s to later 1770s. Smith, Kames and Millar were content to adhere to the four stage theory. Monboddo's stadial history was more complex, and very much more controversial. He included primates and feral children as material. Robertson in his \"History of America\" moves between narrative and conjectural history.\n\nFerguson in this work attempted a rigorous identification of the hunter stage with the so-called barbarian or savage, and was very alive to the whole scheme as full of tensions within human possibility. He argued against the foundation story in the style of classical history, proposing instead that unintended consequences could have more to do with the \"establishment\" of a society than a self-conscious law-giver.\n\nMillar argued in terms of a \"system of manners\" associated with each of the four stages. He also discussed the advance of freedom, and denounced slavery. As property became more complex, it followed that government did so also. Poovey states that this work makes apparent the relationship of conjectural history with the experimental moral philosophy of Thomas Reid and George Turnbull.\n\nKames has been called the leader of Scottish conjectural history, and had objections he expressed in correspondence to both Rousseau and the approach of Montesquieu, as reducing the role of human nature, which he thought was not a constant but the goal of the investigation. The connection was that conjectural history was to be used as a framework of a discussion of natural law. In writing to Basel in search of a suitable opponent to Rousseau, Kames prompted a work from Isaak Iselin, \"Ueber die Geschichte der Menschheit\" (1764), which is also a conjectural history.\n\nThe \"Sketches\" was a collection of essays on social, cultural and political topics. In it the author collected some ethnographic and miscellaneous information, assembling in particular a long chapter intended as a \"history of women\". There was a second edition (Edinburgh, 1778) and a third (Dublin, 1779). Kames was an early polygenist, or was an environmental monogenist only with scepticism about the adequacy of the theory. In any case he argued that his approach could be reconciled with the scriptural ethnography, via the story of the Tower of Babel. While he stated that he had collected materials for a history for 30 years, Kames's work as written up was unsystematic, even rambling. His scheme of conjectural history includes the idea that the providential order allows the historian to write in the absence of a full factual basis. A German translation by Anton Ernst Klausing appeared as \"Versuche über die Geschichte des Menschen\" from 1774.\n\nMainstream conjectural and philosophical history, in the Scottish style, hardly survived as a living tradition into the 1790s. Works went out of print; younger authors such as John Adams, William Alexander and John Logan failed to renew the ideas, with Alexander's \"History of Women\" (1779) being criticised as shallow. Dugald Stewart's formulation of conjectural history was published in 1794, in his \"Account\" of Adam Smith for the \"Transactions\" of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The question has been raised as to Stewart's intention then in describing the tradition in that way, and John Burrow has argued that he wished to dissociate Smith from political radicalism.\n\nWhere stadial theory appeared in later authors, the original thrust was distorted. Hopfl has said that the heirs were James Mill, John Stuart Mill, and Auguste Comte. Hawthorne writes instead of the historical/sociological insights of the Scots being lost in the British context, despite the \"tension between a 'natural' account of civil society and a developing sense of the factual importance and moral difficulties of individualism\" having become apparent, to utilitarianism and vaguer evolutionism.\n\nThe \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", in its second edition but particularly in its third edition (1797), attacked the premises of conjectural history from a biblical angle. In the second edition James Tytler opposed the polygenist approach of Kames. The third edition, under the editorship of George Gleig, featured \"Savage\" as a new topic, and expanded articles \"Society\" and \"Moral philosophy\". Cross-referenced to theological and biblical topics, and to articles by David Doig who had answered Kames with \"Two Letters on the Savage State\" from 1775/6, these articles in particular argued the orthodox Christian case. Robert Heron contributed to the article \"Society\", and took aim at the four stages theory, claiming polygenism followed from it (in contradiction to the Bible). Further, the assumption of a baseline state of savagery also seemed to Heron to be implicated with polygenism; and he with Doig attacked the assumption as echoing Lucretius and Democritus, and godless materialist spontaneous generation of humankind, implicit in the whole idea of conjectural history. The articles on \"Beauty\" and \"Love\" were also changed to remove the influence of Kames, as part of the consistent assertion of scriptural monogenism.\n\nConjectural argument had a bad name in 18th century British antiquarian circles. An austere and sceptical approach centred on facts, as adopted by Richard Gough and James Douglas, was favoured in the second half of the century. On the other hand, the interpretations of the stadial theory were quite welcome, and while popularised by the Scottish school, did not seem innovative in the sense of a break with Early Modern historiography, and concerns with natural law and civic humanism. The urban history of John Trussel was a precursor. The discussion of the breakdown of the feudal system was a topic of considerable antiquarian interest. The stadial history was embraced by Thomas Pownall.\n\nCharles Athanase Walckenaer in 1798 took up the four stage theory, augmented to five stages, by dividing \"hunting\" into \"gathering\" followed by a pure hunting stage. This was an effort to classify peoples of the world by development. Early anthropology carried into the 19th century assumptions about the search for origins of civilisation, and unilineal evolution, as appropriate tools for investigating societies. It was widely assumed, further, that current \"peoples\" were a window into the past. These approaches were seen in Lewis Henry Morgan. Eventually, in the 20th century, field work and structural functionalism led to a rejection of the whole paradigm.\n\n"}

{"id": "101140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=101140", "title": "Cultural resources management", "text": "Cultural resources management\n\nIn the broadest sense, cultural resources management (CRM) is the vocation and practice of managing cultural resources, such as the arts and heritage. It incorporates Cultural Heritage Management which is concerned with traditional and historic culture. It also delves into the material culture of archaeology. Cultural resources management encompasses current culture, including progressive and innovative culture, such as urban culture, rather than simply preserving and presenting traditional forms of culture.\n\nHowever, the broad usage of the term is relatively recent and as a result it is most often used as synonymous with heritage management. In the United States, cultural resources management is not usually divorced from the heritage context. The term is, \"used mostly by archaeologists and much more occasionally by architectural historians and historical architects, to refer to managing historic places of archaeological, architectural, and historical interests and considering such places in compliance with environmental and historic preservation laws.\" \n\nCultural resources include both physical assets such as archaeology, architecture, paintings and sculptures and also intangible culture such as folklore and interpretative arts, such as storytelling and drama. Cultural resource managers are typically in charge of museums, galleries, theatres etc., especially those that emphasize culture specific to the local region or ethnic group. Cultural tourism is a significant sector of the tourism industry.\n\nAt a national and international level, cultural resource management may be concerned with larger themes, such as languages in danger of extinction, public education, the ethos or operation of multiculturalism, and promoting access to cultural resources. The Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity is an attempt by the United Nations to identify exemplars of intangible culture.\n\nCultural resource management can trace its beginning to the environment/conservational movement in the 1960s and 1970s. During this time, there was growth in legislation concerning the protection of cultural resources. The Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974, commonly known as the Moss-Bennett Act, helped to fuel the creation of CRM, while creating “growth in archaeological jobs in the federal government, academia, and private sector.” Federal legislation had passed earlier in 1906 under the Antiquities Act, but it was not until the 1970s when the term “cultural resources” was coined by the National Park Service. This term came into more popular usage after two meetings in 1974: the Cultural Resource Management conference and the Airlie House conference. Following these conferences, the National Park Service (NPS) defined cultural resources in the Cultural Resource Management Guidelines as being:\n\n“Those tangible and intangible aspects of cultural systems, both living and dead, that are valued by or representative of a given culture or that contain information about a culture…[They] include but are not limited to sites, structures, districts, objects, and historic documents associated with or representative of peoples, cultures, and human activities and events, either in the present or in the past. Cultural resources also can include primary written and verbal data for interpretation and understanding of those tangible resources.” \n\nCultural resources management in the heritage context is mainly concerned with the investigation of sites with archaeological potential, the preservation and interpretation of historic sites and artifacts, and the culture of indigenous people. The subject developed from initiatives in rescue archaeology, sensitivities to the treatment of indigenous people, and subsequent legislation to protect cultural heritage.\n\nIn the 1970s, archaeologists created the term \"cultural resource management\" as a parallel to natural resource management to address the following resources:\n\nA significant proportion of the archaeological investigation in countries that have heritage management legislation including the United States and United Kingdom is conducted on sites under threat of development. In the US, such investigations are now done by private companies on a consulting basis, and a national organization exists to support the practice of CRM. Museums, besides being popular tourist attractions, often play roles in conservation of, and research on, threatened sites, including as repositories for collections from sites slated for destruction.\n\nIn the United States, a common Cultural Resource Management task is the implementation of a Section 106 review: CRM archaeologists determine whether federally funded projects are likely to damage or destroy archaeological sites that may be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. This process commonly entails one or more archaeological field surveys.\n\nCultural resource management features people from a wide array of disciplines. The general education of most involved in CRM includes, but is not limited to, sociology, archaeology, architectural history, cultural anthropology, social and cultural geography, and other fields in the social sciences.\n\nIn the field of cultural resource management there are many career choices. One could obtain a career with an action agency that works directly with the NEPA or even more specifically, Native American resources. There are also careers that can be found in review agencies like the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), or the state historic preservation office (SHPO) Beyond these choices, one could also obtain a career as part of the local government and work with planning agencies, housing agencies, social service agencies, local museums, libraries, or educational institutions. Jobs at private cultural resource management companies can range from field technicians (see shovelbum) to principal investigators, project archaeologists, historic preservationists, and laboratory work. One could also become a part of an advocacy organization, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\n\nIt is commonly debated in cultural resource management how to determine whether cultural or archaeological sites should be considered significant or not. The criteria that is stated by the National Register of Historic Places is said to be able to be “interpreted in different ways so that the significance… may be subjectively argued for many cultural resources.” Another issue that arises among scholars is that “protection does not necessarily mean preservation.” Any public projects occurring near the cultural resource can have adverse effects. Development plans for a proposed project may not be able to be changed to limit impact and to avoid damage to the resource.\n\nThe vocation of management in cultural and creative sectors is the subject of research and improvement initiatives, by organizations such as Arts and Business which take a partnership approach to involving professional business people in running and mentoring arts organizations. Some universities now offer vocational degrees.\n\nThe management of cultural heritage is underpinned by academic research in archaeology, ethnography and history. The broader subject is also underpinned by research in sociology and culture studies.\n\nUnderstanding the traditional cultures of all peoples (Indigenous or not) is essential in mitigating the adverse impact of development and ensuring that intervention by more developed nations is not prejudicial to the interests of local people or results in the extinction of cultural resources.\n\nCultural resources policies have developed over time with the recognition of the economic and social importance of heritage and other cultural assets.\n\nThe exploitation of cultural resources can be controversial, particularly where the finite cultural heritage resources of developing countries are exported to satisfy the demand for antiquities market in the developed world. The exploitation of the potential intellectual property of traditional remedies in identifying candidates for new drugs has also been controversial. On the other hand, traditional crafts can be important elements of income from tourism, performance of traditional dances, and music that is popular with tourists and traditional designs can be exploited in the fashion industry. Popular culture can also be an important economic asset.\n\n\n\n"}

The country has 527 languages, seven of them are extinct. Nigeria also has over 1150 dialects and ethnic groups. The six largest ethnic groups are the Hausa and Fulani in the north, the Igbo in the southeast, and the Yoruba predominate in the southwest, the Tiv people of North Central Nigeria and the Efik - Ibibio. \nThe Edo people are most frequent in the region between Yorubaland and Igboland. Many of the Edo tend to be Christian. This group is followed by the Ibibio/Annang/Efik people of the coastal south southern Nigeria and the Ijaw of the Niger Delta.\n\nNigeria's other ethnic groups, sometimes called 'minorities', are found throughout the country but especially in the north and the middle belt. The traditionally nomadic Fulani can be found all over West and Central Africa. The Fulani and the Hausa are predominantly Muslim while the Igbo are predominantly Christian and so are the Efik, Ibibio, and Annang people. The Yoruba are equally likely to be either Christian or Muslim. Indigenous religious practices remain important to all of Nigeria's ethnic groups, and frequently these beliefs are blended with Christian beliefs, a practice known as syncretism.\n\nThe Efik-Ibibio culture of coastal southeastern Nigeria has a significant contribution to the Nigerian culture, especially the culture of southern part of Nigeria. A brief summary is as follows:\n\n\nEghosa the queen of Bini\n\nThe Yorubas are located on the western region of Nigeria.\n\nThe eastern part of Nigeria is the home of the Igbos, who are mostly Christians. Their traditional religion is known as \nOmenani. Socially they are led by monarchs known as Eze Igwes. These figures in turn are expected to confer subordinate titles upon men and woman that are highly accomplished. This is known as the Nze na Ozo title system. People of title are usually well-spoken, highly respected and well recognized in their communities.\n\nNigeria is famous for its English language literature. \"Things Fall Apart\", by Chinua Achebe, is an important book in African literature. With over eight million copies sold worldwide, it has been translated into 50 languages, making Achebe the most translated African writer of all time.\n\nNigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka described the work as \"the first novel in English which spoke from the interior of the African character, rather than portraying the African as an exotic, as the white man would see him.\"\n\nApart from the speakers of standard English, a large portion of the population, roughly a third, speaks Nigerian pidgin, which has a primarily English lexicon. It has become a common \"lingua franca\" as a result. Pidgin English is a creolized form of the language. For instance, \"How you dey\" means \"How are you\". \"The Palm Wine Drinkard\", a popular novel by Amos Tutuola, was written in it. \n\nSince the 1990s the Nigerian movie industry, sometimes called \"Nollywood\", has emerged as a fast-growing cultural force all over Africa. Because of the movies, western influences such as music, casual dressing and methods of speaking are to be found all across Nigeria, even in the highly conservative north of the country.\n\nSupporters of English football clubs like Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea often segregate beyond the traditional tribal and even religious divide to share their common cause in Premier League teams. The Nigerian national football team, nicknamed the \"Super Eagles\", is the national team of Nigeria, run by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). According to the FIFA World Rankings, Nigeria ranks 22nd and holds the third highest place among the African nations behind Cameroon (11th) and Côte d'Ivoire (16th). The highest position Nigeria ever reached on the ranking was 5th, in April 1994.\n\nNigerian food offers a rich blend of traditionally African carbohydrates such as yam and cassava as well as the vegetable soups with which they are often served. Maize is another crop that is commonly grown in Nigeria. Praised by Nigerians for the strength it gives, garri is \"the number one staple carbohydrate food item in Nigeria\"\na powdered cassava grain that can be readily eaten as a meal and is quite inexpensive. Yams are frequently fried either fried in oil or pounded to make a mashed potato-like yam pottage. Nigerian beans, quite different from green peas, are widely popular. Meat is also popular and Nigerian suya—a barbecue-like roasted meat—is a well-known delicacy. Bush meat, meat from wild game like antelope and giraffes, is also popular. Fermented palm products make a traditional liquor, palm wine, and also fermented cassava. Nigerian foods are spicy, mostly in the western and southern part of the country, even more so than in Indian cuisine. Some more examples of their traditional dishes are eba, pounded yam, iyan, fufu and soups like okra, ogbono and egusi. Fufu is so emblematic of Nigeria that it figures in Chinua Achebe's \"Things Fall Apart\", for example. Achebe's magnum opus is the most widely read book in modern African literature.\n\nThe music of Nigeria includes many kinds of folk and popular music, some of which are known worldwide. The singer and social activist Fela Kuti was instrumental in Nigeria's musical development. \n\nTraditional musicians use a number of diverse instruments, such as Gongon drums. The kora and the kakaki are also important.\n\nOther traditional cultural expressions are found in the various masquerades of Nigeria, such as the Eyo masquerades, the Ekpe and Ekpo Masquerades of the Efik/Ibibio/Annang/Igbo peoples of coastal southeastern Nigeria, and the Northern Edo Masquerades. The most popular Yoruba manifestations of this custom are the Gelede masquerades.\n\nA very important source of information on modern Nigerian art is the Virtual Museum of Modern Nigerian Art operated by the Pan-Atlantic University in Lagos.\n\nIn addition, the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission, and Naija Invest Gateway, provide real time information on the Nigerian business culture.\n\nWomen wear long flowing robes and headscarves made from local markets who dye and weave the fabric locally. Southern Nigerian women choose to wear western-style wear. People in urban regions of Nigeria dress in western style, the youth mainly wearing jeans and T-shirts. Other Nigerian men and women typically wear a traditional style called \"Buba\". For men the loose fitting shirt goes down to halfway down the thigh. For women, the loose fitting blouse goes down a little below the waist. Other clothing gear includes a \"gele\", which is the woman's headgear. For men their traditional cap is called \"fila\".\nThe dressing and colours of the garments can sometimes change according to the occasion to be attended.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58370852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58370852", "title": "Dove Book", "text": "Dove Book\n\nThe Verse about the Book of the Dove (Голубиная книга, \"Golubinaya Kniga\") is a medieval Russian religious ballad. At least 20 versions are known. They vary in length from 30 to over 900 lines. The poem is generally thought to have been written ca. 1500 in the Novgorod region, though Russian nationalists postulate its great antiquity. The earliest extant manuscript is dated to the 17th century.\n\nThe poem's folk cosmology and the title have been derived by Vladimir Toporov from the \"Bundahishn\". Several major Russian poets and artists of the early 20th century (such as Nicholas Roerich and Andrey Bely) were inspired by the \"Dove-Book\". The Russian Orthodox Church had it banned as a heretical mixture of apocryphal Christian tales with pagan lore. \n\nThe main part of the \"Dove-Book\" is a long sequence of riddles. In a series of answers to those riddles, King David explains the origin of light, sun, moon, and social classes. He also mentions a mysterious stone \"clept the Alatyr\". Isabel Florence Hapgood describes the content of one version in the following terms:\n\"The Dove Book\" falls from Alatyr, the \"burning white stone on the Island of Buyan\", the heathen paradise, which lies far towards sunrise, in the \"Ocean Sea\". The heathen significance of the stone is not known, but it is cleverly explained in \"The Dove Book\" as the stone whereon Christ stood when he preached to his disciples. This \"little book\" (\"forty fathoms long and twenty wide\") was written by St. John the Evangelist, and no man can read it. The book is somewhat suggestive of the \"little book\" in Revelation. The prophet Isaiah deciphered only three pages of it in as many years. But the \"most wise tsar David\" undertakes to give, from memory, the book's answers to various questions put to him by Tsar Vladimir (as spokesman of a throng of emperors and princes). A great deal of curious information is conveyed - all very poetically expressed - including some odd facts in natural history, such as: that the ostrich is the mother of birds, and that she lives, feeds, and rears her young on the blue sea, drowning mariners and sinking ships. Whenever she (or the Indrik-Beast) moves, an earthquake ensues.\n\n"}
{"id": "1816470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1816470", "title": "Elderly martial arts master", "text": "Elderly martial arts master\n\nThe elderly martial arts master is a mentor/teacher stock character in fiction, especially \"Wuxia\", \"Chanbara\", and other martial arts films. Typically an East Asian male, he is a near-invincible master of the martial arts, despite being advanced in age and presumably having a decrease in physical strength. Often he possesses the rank of Sensei (or teacher) and is referred to as such by his student. The elderly master most often teaches either generic kung fu or an exotic style specific to the fictional period (see List of fictional martial arts). During the films, the master often becomes close with their student, with the master becoming a guardian figure to the trainee, who is, in turn, looked upon as a son or daughter. Usually, when the master is captured or killed, or an iconic portrait of the deceased master has been desecrated by some villains, the hero will take it upon themselves to rescue or avenge their master.\n\nA typical elderly sensei spends most of his time meditating in a dojo. The master is typically a serene, calm, sober and reserved old man. He represents the maturity and self-contentment that comes with age, along with the quiet confidence that comes with experience—both of life in general and of the skills and also the ideals and values that he has inherited from the martial arts. To him, his martial art is not just a way to beat people up or to act tough, it is—in keeping with the values and ideals generally attached to and associated with the martial arts by the Oriental societies—more a means to positively developing one's personality and way of living to cultivate values such as respect, patience, self-control, discipline and the whole lot. The master is polite towards everyone, even the mischief makers who would misbehave with him sometime in the course of the movie. He always tries to verbally prevent mischief makers or the rival martial artist (who is often young and arrogant and sees the martial arts only as a means to act tough and bully people) for as long as he can, and that too politely. Only when he is forced to use his skills and left with no option, he shows how the mischief makers are no match for him—thereby demonstrating how politeness should not be mistaken for weakness. These are shown, for example, by Iroh in the \"\", Mr. Miyagi in the \"Karate Kid\" series, the Janitor in the new \"Karate Kid\", or Yoda of \"Star Wars\".\n\nThe master always speaks in a very calm and composed manner. In case of the master being east-Asian, as is almost always in such films, he is invariably given the accent of an Oriental (Chinese or Japanese) who is not used to speaking in English and can only speak it without much fluency and speed. His way of speaking takes on a particularly benevolent, patient, affectionate and friend-philosopher-guide tone when he speaks with his disciple. He typically reprimands and/or castigates the protégé in his more \"raw\" and \"immature\" stage, but always in a fatherly manner. In most films of this genre, he often controls or restrains his protégé, from getting provoked and retaliating at the \"bad boy(s)\", and makes the protégé realize that everything has the \"right place and time\" and that losing control of oneself or giving in to the provocations of the rival or enemy is not like the true martial artist he wants his disciple to become. \nHis speech is also full of philosophical observations, anecdotes, short parables or insights, that are mostly intended to constantly improve the insight and knowledge of the disciple in the martial arts, but also at times to improve his personality, behavior, moral values, and way of life. In the martial arts epic \"Enter The Dragon\", the old master at the beginning of the film is seen taking a walk with the hero played by Bruce Lee, where he tells his best disciple how the latter has succeeded in acquiring an intuitive skill in the art that has gone beyond the mere physical, and how it is his duty now to use that wisely and prudently in life. \nThe master's dialogues with the protégé would often carry short recollection of his own earlier life, his fighting or career experiences, or how he had come upon a particular knowledge or insight.\n\nThough the master is always the benevolent father-figure, he can be very strict when it comes to the training. He does not give any false hope to the protégé when it comes to training. He makes it very clear that in order to trained by him, the young man has to be unquestioningly obedient and be ready to bear the pain.\n\nIn the movie \"Bloodsport\", the teenage Frank Dux is treated by the Japanese master Senzo Tanaka in a very fatherly and affectionate manner in general, but the training in rigorous and harsh, and the master never gives any relief or comfort zone to Frank Dux. In the movie \"Kickboxer\", the hero played by Jean-Claude Van Damme is made to kick the palm tree trunk with his bare shins, until he fractures his shin and drops to the ground in agony.\n\nIn \"The Karate Kid\", Mr. Miyagi makes Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) paint the fences and walls, and wipe the floors and the cars, with two specific arm-movements day after day, and only when Mr. Miyagi tests (by mock attacks) and finds that those movements have become spontaneous and unconscious reactions from Daniel, does he give the boy respite from that toil. It was then that Daniel too realizes, why after all his master had made him do that for days—in spite of him becoming tired, aching and fed-up—for those are actually blocking and parrying techniques, which his master by his experience, had ingrained into him without his being aware of it.\n\nIn many movies, the hero, after being wronged in some way by the rival gang or fighter, or after having his martial artist brother, or friend, maimed for life (or even killed) by the formidable and vicious fighter, seeks the master out himself with a resolution to take revenge. In such cases, the master is often unwilling at first, and may appear to be so just to test the seriousness and commitment of the protégé. But finally after a few days, he agrees to start training, after he feels the protégé has passed his test. The training imparted is typically harsh and rigorous right from day-one, and the master does not care if the hero has bruised and bloodied himself all over. He often administers medicine and pain-relief techniques, which are in many cases seen to be associated skills that such masters possess along with fighting techniques—since oriental martial arts are also closely related and complementary to traditional physio-therapy and healing systems. \nYet, in other movies, the protégé does not really have to persuade or coax the master. The master is seen right from the beginning. He and the protégé get to know each other often by a random event.\n\nIn \"Bloodsport\", the teenage Frank Dux sees a katana sword through the window of Senzo Tanaka's house, and in his teenage immaturity, decides to steal it with two of his friends. He is caught in the act, by the master and his son who was of the same age as Frank. But the master in gentle and kind to Frank, and instead of seeing that Frank is punished, decides to teach him a long term moral lesson—that such a sword can only be earned through merit, one cannot be a fighter by stealing it. He talks to Frank's parents about the benefits of martial training and expresses the wish to make Frank his student. That became the beginning of a lasting and close father-son like relationship between Frank and Tanaka, and when Tanaka's son died as a young adult, it was Frank—by then grown into a mature young man, a soldier in the army and a worthy disciple—whom Tanaka saw as his deserving successor and inheritor of his martial legacy. The training phase of the movie thus ended with a quiet ceremony in which Tanaka was seen handing over his katana to Frank, signifying Frank's success in earning that sword, which he had tried to steal as a young boy, by merit and qualification. Frank, too shows the place his master occupies in his life by dedicating his victory in the underground Kumite to him.\n\nIn the second \"Karate Kid\" movie, there is a touching scene where Daniel LaRusso is seen coming up to the bereaved and tearful Mr. Miyagi, who was sitting alone facing the sea and grieving for his father who had just died. Daniel sits besides him and comforts the old Mr. Miyagi both with words and an arm on his shoulder.\n\nIn some movies, the ability of the master to make his protégé rise above the thought of \"revenge\", and to acquire the moral strength and fortitude to hold himself back from doing to the rival/ villain the same thing that the latter once had done to his brother or friend, even in the face of the strongest provocation, is shown very movingly and dramatically. In the Taekwondo classic \"Best of the Best\", featuring some world-renowned martial-artists and a renowned martial arts grandmaster Hee Il Cho, the coach of the American team Frank Couzo (James Earl Jones), prevents the American fighter in the last face-off of the competition, Tommy Lee (Phillip Rhee), from dealing a fatal blow to his Korean opponent Dae Han Park (played by Philip's real-life brother Simon Rhee). Tommy had maimed his opponent and rendered him helpless by disabling his arms and legs, and the Korean could barely keep standing and taking a fighting stance. This was the same man who had cruelly killed his brother in sport combat years ago with excessive brutality. All Tommy had to do was to deal the final maiming or death blow with a powerful kick he had already braced himself for, as the scene of his brother's death flashed through his mind. But Coach Couzo's gentle but strong \"No!\" \"No!\" call from the sidelines helped Tommy avoid repeating the same crime for the sake of revenge and coming down to the level of Dae Han. By doing so, he won over Dae Han with moral strength instead of and eye-for-an-eye revenge, which made Dae Han repent and approach Tommy to hail him and give him his own medal after the fight was over.\n\nAlthough it is not necessarily a rule or always true, the elder martial arts master is almost always depicted as being childless and unmarried, the character having either never having had a wife or child or having lost both at some point in his life (Mr. Miyagi is a prime example of this). This is often contrasted by the hero having either a very strained relationship with his parents, or often depicted as having no parents at all in the picture. This common ground between the characters, as well as the hard training the hero must go through at the hands of his master, lead to a very close bonding experience between the two, with the master assuming a fatherly role to his young protégé, who is turn becomes a son to his master. Their mutual enemy, as well as the battles and issues they face throughout the film, help bring them together as the film progresses making the hero ultimately realize that, although his master pushed him hard, he is beloved in the end, having become a son. In turn, when viewing the hero triumph and succeed in his battle, the master experiences a fathers pride in his protégé.\n\nThe old master shows a wry sense of humor at times. Master Tanaka flashes his katana with a practiced lightning speed to cleanly cut off the visor of Frank's baseball cap, with Frank becoming wide-eyed in frightened surprise. In \"Kickboxer\" the lead character of Jean-Claude Van Damme is awakened flabbergasted at dawn by a splash of cold water from his master. The Kung Fu movies starring Jackie Chan are probably the most mentionable as containing the most instances of master-disciple frolics. In \"The Karate Kid\", when an arrogant rival misbehaves, Miyagi tells Daniel a story about Okinawa: there was a bull that terrorized everyone, but one fine day there was a feast, when everyone was scared no more. The angry bull became tasty soup.\n\nThe Master also keeps an eye on his protégé's less martial and more \"romantic\" activities. He views them in an indulgent manner, as Mr. Miyagi does in the case of Daniel, as something that is but normal for the protégé's age. But he also takes care, directly or indirectly, to make the disciple remember that the \"girl\" should not be interfering with and hampering his martial arts training or lessening his commitment to training. Miyagi also displays humor when he explains to Daniel the importance of belts in martial arts: \"belt hold up pants.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "768309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=768309", "title": "Ethnic enclave", "text": "Ethnic enclave\n\nIn sociology, an ethnic enclave is a geographic area with high ethnic concentration, characteristic cultural identity, and economic activity. The term is usually used to refer to either a residential area or a workspace with a high concentration of ethnic firms. Their success and growth depends on self-sufficiency, and is coupled with economic prosperity.\n\nThe theory of social capital and the formation of migrant networks creates the social foundation for ethnic enclaves. Douglas Massey describes how migrant networks provide new immigrants with social capital that can be transferred to other tangible forms. As immigrants tend to cluster in close geographic spaces, they develop migrant networks—systems of interpersonal relations through which participants can exchange valuable resources and knowledge. Immigrants can capitalize on social interactions by transforming information into tangible resources, and thereby lower costs of migration. Information exchanged may include knowledge of employment opportunities, affordable housing, government assistance programs and helpful NGOs. Thus by stimulating social connections, ethnic enclaves generate a pool of intangible resources that help to promote the social and economic development of its members.\n\nBy providing a space for co-ethnics to create potentially beneficial relations, ethnic enclaves assist members in achieving economic mobility. Enclaves create an alternative labor market that is ethnic-specific and does not demand social and cultural skills of the host country. By eliminating language and cultural barriers, enclave economies employ a greater proportion of co-ethnics and speed the incorporation of new immigrants into a bustling economy. By increasing employment opportunities and facilitating upward mobility, studying ethnic enclaves helps to explain the success of some immigrant groups. Additionally, while the ethnic enclave theory was developed to explain immigrant incorporation into the receiving society, it has also been linked to migration processes at large as successful incorporation of immigrants has the potential to lower migration costs for future immigrants, an example of chain migration.\n\nDespite their immediate benefits, the long-term implications of participation in an ethnic enclave are a topic of debate. Enclave economies have been linked to a glass ceiling limiting immigrant growth and upward mobility. While participation in the enclave economy may assist in achieving upward mobility through increased availability of employment opportunities in the enclave labor market, it may also impede acquisition of host country skills that benefit the immigrant over the long-run. Such delays constrain immigrants to activity within the enclave and secludes them from the larger economy. Opportunities available to mainstream society can thus be out of reach for immigrants who haven't learned about them. Thus, the accelerated path toward economic mobility that lures new immigrants into enclave economies may impede success. Integration into an ethnic enclave may delay and even halt cultural assimilation, preventing the immigrants from benefiting from mainstream institutions.\n\nHistorically, the formation of ethnic enclaves has been the result of a variety of socioeconomic factors that draw immigrants to similar spaces in the receiving country. The lack of access to economic capital and of knowledge regarding residential neighborhoods can constrain newly arrived immigrants to regions of affordable housing. Social dynamics such as prejudice and racism may concentrate co-ethnics into regions displaying ethnic similarity. Housing discrimination may also prevent ethnic minorities from settling into a particular residential area outside the enclave. When discussing the ethnic enclave as defined by a spatial cluster of businesses, success and growth can be largely predicted by three factors. These factors include 1) the size and population of the enclave 2) the level of entrepreneurial skills of those in the enclave and 3) the availability of capital resources to the enclave. Successful enclaves can reach a point where they become self-sufficient, or \"institutionally complete\" through the supply of new immigrants and demand of goods offered in the market. They only reach this point after first supplying for the needs of co-ethnics and then expanding to meet needs of those in the larger market of the host society.\n\nThe term \"ethnic enclave\" arose in response to a publication by Alejandro Portes and Kenneth Wilson in 1980. Portes and Wilson identified a third labor market in which Cuban immigrants in Miami took part. Instead of entering the secondary labor market of the host society, Portes and Wilson discovered that new immigrants tended to become employed by co-ethnics running immigrant-owned firms. The collection of small immigrant enterprises providing employment to new immigrants was defined as the enclave economy.\n\nObservations of the Cuban ethnic enclave economy in Miami led Alejandro Portes and Kenneth Wilson to conclude that participation in an enclave economy provided immigrants with an alternative, speedy option to achieve economic mobility in a host society. The discourse pioneered by Portes and Wilson produced the construct for a body of literature that came to be known by the ethnic enclave hypothesis. While never empirically defined, the term \"ethnic enclave\" began to be widely used to represent two distinct definitions: that of an enclave economy and that of a residential area of high co-ethnic concentration. The most fundamental concept within the enclave hypothesis is that of social capital, which lays the foundation for the establishment of migrant networks and the advantages associated with them.\n\nWith the rise in globalization and ease of international transportation, patterns of immigration show the role of ethnic enclaves for contributing to increased migration over time. New immigrants unintentionally lower costs for future immigration of co-ethnics by pooling together resources for themselves. Thus, by achieving mobility in the receiving country themselves, immigrants create a social structure that makes it easier for future immigrants to become upwardly mobile. According to Douglas Massey, \"Networks build into the migration process a self-perpetuating momentum that leads to its growth over time, in spite of fluctuating wage differentials, recessions, and increasingly restrictive immigration policies.\" \nEthnic enclaves thus contribute to continued immigration by providing co-ethnics with a space to make connections that ultimately lower migration costs and promote economic mobility. Many worn path taken by former immigrants are made accessible to enclave members, making immigration easier to future generations. By generating further immigration, migration leads to its own cumulative causation over time.\n\nAn approach that analyzes ethnic enclaves and their members by their modes of incorporation is preferred to a neoclassical model, which states that the economic success of immigrants depends on the education, work experience, and other elements of human capital that they possess. Sociologists have concluded that these factors do not suffice in explaining the integration and success of immigrants measured by occupational mobility and earnings.\n\nUpon arrival to a foreign country, immigrants face challenges in assimilation and integration processes and thus experience different modes and levels of incorporation within the host society. Many factors influence the level of ease or challenge experienced by immigrants as they make the transition and undergo physical, social, and psychological challenges. The segmented assimilation model notes that there can exist a \"consciously pluralistic society in which a variety of subcultures and racial and ethnic identities coexist\" \n\nOne influential factor in an immigrant's journey is the presence of relatives or friends in the receiving country. Friends and family, making up a kinship network, who are willing to help the newcomers can be classified as a type of capital commonly referred to as social capital. Upon arrival, many immigrants have limited or no access to human capital and thus rely heavily on any available source of social capital. The cost to immigration is large, however this burden can be shared and thus eased through an immigrant's access to social capital in the receiving country. Kinship networks in the receiving country can provide aid not only for the physical and economic needs of immigrants, but also for their emotional and socio-psychological needs.\n\nAccess to social capital does not guarantee ease or success for the migrant. Because social capital is rooted in relationships it easily lends itself to conflict and disagreement between parties. The level of economic stability on the side of the receiving party can dictate the level of aid they are willing or able to offer. In addition, the economic condition of the country and the availability of jobs open to the immigrants can largely affect the quality of the support network available to the migrant. If the receiving country provides favorable conditions such as access to social programs, the local economy, and employment opportunities, the network is likely to be of much higher quality. Adversely, kinship networks may break down if much stress is placed on the relationships involved due to economic hardships. The duration and intensity of aid needed can dictate the quality of the kinship network available to the immigrant. Immigrant ideas regarding level of support to be received are often high and left unmet if true economic conditions do not allow for favorable network conditions. Shared norms and relational ties can also lead to obligatory ties which some scholars, such as Tsang and Inkpen, argue restricts an individual's willingness to explore opportunities outside the network.\n\nMethods of assimilation and access to social capital vary between and even within ethnic groups. A variety of factors can influence individuals' ethnic identities including their social class background and the social networks available to them. As theorized by sociologist Mary C. Waters, the involvement level of parents in ethnic organizations or activities heavily influences the development of their children's ethnic identities. This is important to note as second-generation immigrants must actively work to identify themselves with their ethnic group.\n\nEnclave networks offer access to a unique type of social capital and act as large kinship networks. Within enclave networks, social capital commonly exists both as a private and public good. Though there is some debate in relation to the long-term benefits offered by these networks, the short-term benefits are universally acknowledged. The socio-psychological challenges faced by the immigrant can be largely reduced through the individual's entrance into an ethnic enclave. Ethnic enclaves can resemble the immigrant's place of origin through physical look, layout, and language employed both written and orally. In addition to increasing the cultural comfort of the migrant, healthy ethnic enclaves offer solidarity and trust among members, and informal training systems within the workplace. The geographic proximity of the enclave network allows for easy flow of knowledge and varying types of assistance between firms as well. Where there is an atmosphere of trust in ethnic enclaves, this transfer of knowledge and sharing of social capital exists as an asset to the firms. Connections with members in an enclave may also afford the newcomer work opportunities. Immigrants may also receive informal training regarding the customs and practices of the larger culture outside the enclave and help navigating challenges in many areas of everyday life. Social hostility may be a challenge faced by immigrants in their host society, therefore to avoid this factor, ethnic enclaves provide a haven where economic success may still be achieved.\n\nThe processes of enclave economies can only be fully understood through a sociological perspective that considers economic sociology and the sociology of immigration. Ethnic Enclaves generate a pool of social capital through which members can access resources that lower the costs of migration. Economic assistance through enclave membership takes the form of job opportunities, loans for small businesses, and other forms of economic assistance.\nSmall ethnic firms within the enclave provide new immigrants with immediate access to economic opportunities by subverting the secondary sector of the economy and creating numerous low-wage jobs that are easily accessed by members. The barriers of entry into the enclave economy are significantly lowered due to the ethno-centric nature of businesses and firms. Goods and services tend to be offered in the language of that enclave. Additionally, social and cultural norms specific to the host country are not required of employees in the enclave economy. Thus, the ethno-specific nature of enclave economies makes them attractive to new immigrants who lack the social and cultural skills necessary to integrate into the mainstream economy.\n\nEntrance into the enclave economy is dependent upon the conditions of incorporation experienced by the individual. Unfavorable modes of incorporation into the host society provide incentives for immigrants to enter the informal economy. Discrimination, hostility and lack of resources may encourage immigrants to enter into informal forms of employment for survival. Ethnic enclaves are rich in informal activities, as the entrepreneurial services making the core of the enclave's founding were historically informal ventures. Informality proves favorable for immigrant entrepreneurships, allowing them to bypass costly regulations. Additionally, the scope of employment for immigrants is greatly widened by the availability of informal jobs in the enclave economic sector. \nThe informality of the enclave economy is also a reason for risk and fraud. Informal activities are constantly under risk of detection by the formal sector, which has a negative effect on job security. Furthermore, due to the absence of legal framework, immigrant laborers often remain silent about various forms of exploitation. The most common form of labor exploitation in immigrant economies is unpaid labor. Undocumented immigrants are especially afraid to report violations of labor laws and exploitation.\n\nGovernment policy toward immigrants is the first mode of reception to the receiving country. Governments generally enforce measures to reduce the amount of \"unwanted\" immigrants which may potentially pose a burden on the receiving society and economy. The granting of different statuses and visas (i.e. refugee, temporary visas for students and workers) to immigrant groups affects the type of reception immigrants will receive. Aside from immigration control policies, some governments also impose measures to accelerate social and political incorporation of new immigrants, and to stimulate economic mobility.\n\nWayne Cornelius studies two central theses regarding institutional response to increased movement of people across transnational borders. The first of these is the gap hypothesis which describes the dissonance between official immigration policies and real policy outcomes. Policy gaps are the result of unintended consequences and inadequate enforcement by the receiving society. Many reasons can explain unintended consequences of immigration policy. Governments with undefined or ambiguous stances toward immigration may propagate unintended consequences, and the reliance on flawed policies can further reduce the efficacy of institutional measures. Furthermore, political incoherency policy poses a greater challenge for the incorporation and enforcement of effective measures.\n\nA negative public opinion toward immigrants is a good measure of significant policy gaps in the receiving government; however, special interest groups may also constrain political responses to immigration. This is especially true in liberal democracies, where \"lobbying by powerful employer groups, religious groups, ethnic and immigrant advocacy groups, and even labor unions leads governments to adopt more expansionary immigration policies, even when the economy goes bad and general public opinion turns hostile to immigrants.\" Furthermore, governments and special groups in the immigrant-sending country may align themselves with pro-immigration lobbyists in the receiving country. Thus, the policymaking process is complicated by involvement of multiple factions.\n\nThe second thesis studied by Wayne Cornelius is the convergence hypothesis which describes the growing similarity of political responses to immigration among immigrant-receiving countries. These similarities fall into: \"(1) the policies that their governments have adopted to control immigration; (2) policies designed to integrate immigrants into host societies by providing them with social services as well as political, economic, and social rights; and (3) attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policy preferences among general publics.\" \n\nEthnic groups receive various levels of reception by the host society for various reasons. In general, European immigrants tend to encounter little resistance by host countries, while tenets of racism are evinced by widespread resistance to immigrants of color.\n\nPolitical incorporation into the host country is coupled with adoption of citizenship of the host country. By studying the diverging trajectories of immigrant citizenship in Canada and the U.S., Irene Bloemraad explains that current models of citizenship acquisition fail to recognize the social nature of political incorporation. Bloemraad describes political incorporation as a \"social process of mobilization by friends, family, community organizations and local leaders that is embedded in an institutional context shaped by government policies of diversity and newcomer settlement.\" This alternative model emphasizes the role of migrant networks in critically shaping how immigrants consider citizenship. Bloemraad shows that friends, family, co-ethnic organizations and local community affect political incorporation by providing a structured mobilization framework. This social structure is most essential for immigrants who face language barriers and may lack familiarity with host institutions.\n\nThe extent to which migrant networks promote citizenship depends on the efficacy of government policies on immigrant integration. Governments adopting policies that facilitate the emergence, integration and growth of ethnic economies are presumed to gain support by co-ethnics. Thus, the movement toward political incorporation and citizenship is nested in a larger institutional structure involving economic and social integration policy as these relate to immigrants.\nEthnic enclaves have the ability to simultaneously assist in political and civic incorporation of immigrants. By providing a space that facilitates upward mobility and economic integration into the receiving society, enclaves and their members fundamentally influence the perceptions of receiving institutions by co-ethnics. Finally, enclaves may gauge community interest in naturalization and direct immigrants through the process to gaining citizenship\n\nThe discourse surrounding ethnic enclaves has prompted debate among scholars in two related areas of thought. Both areas discuss the role ethnic enclaves play by either offering aid or hindering the economic and social well-being of the enclave's members. One area of thought discusses the role of enclaves in assimilative patterns and upward mobility while the second area of thought argues the economic ramifications associated with membership within ethnic enclaves.\n\nThe immediate economic and social advantages associated with membership in an ethnic enclave are undisputed by scholars, however the long-term consequences remain an area of uncertainty. The role these networks play remains uncertain due to the fact that ethnic enclaves allow immigrants to function successfully within the host society without a significant amount of adjustment either culturally or linguistically. As such, they can either help or hinder naturalization within the host country. The relatively low levels of skill required allow immigrants to achieve financial stability which can in turn encourage eventual naturalization and assimilation. Adversely, this same factor can afford enclave members the opportunity to remain considerably segregated and secluded from the host society. As such, members may circumvent the need to acquire skills necessary for life in the larger host society such as knowledge of cultural norms and language.\n\nThe debate regarding the economic viability of ethnic enclaves revolves around the enclave-economy hypothesis. The hypothesis as written by Wilson and Portes formulates the idea that \"[i]mmigrant workers are not restricted to the secondary labor market.\" They instead argue that \"those inserted into an immigrant enclave can be empirically distinguished from workers in both the primary and secondary labor markets. Enclave workers will share with those in the primary sector a significant economic return past human capital investments\" something those who enter the secondary labor market are not able to enjoy.\nThus, they assert the enclave economy is not a mobility trap as some would term it, but an alternate mode of incorporation.\n\nIn their argument formulated to disprove the enclave economy hypothesis, Sanders and Nee state the need for a distinction between \"immigrant-bosses\" and \"immigrant-workers\" as the economic benefits differ along this distinction. They also call for the investigation of economic opportunities available to those in the enclave, believing them to be lesser in quality and supply. Sanders and Nee also assert the idea that segregation and forced entrance of immigrant-workers into low paying jobs is actually aggravated by the existence of ethnic enclaves. Due to these objections, they call for the revision of Portes and Wilson's hypothesis to include an acknowledgement and outline of the entrepreneur/worker economic benefit distinction.\n\nIn reaction to Sanders and Nee, Portes and Jensen make the clarification that those in ethnic enclaves need not be wealthier than those who left the enclave for the hypothesis to be supported. They instead assert that this will usually not be the case as the constant entrance of new immigrants into the enclave will actually be somewhat burdensome on the economy; a factor which does not actually represent disadvantage when compared with the other advantages provided. Additionally, Portes and Jensen outline three different conditions to be fulfilled in order to disprove their hypothesis. The first of these conditions requires the demonstration that ethnic entrepreneurship is a mobility trap leading to lower earnings than the immigrant's worth in human capital. The second condition requires data proving the work within the enclave to be exploitative, and the third condition requires data showing employment within the enclave leads to a 'dead end' and offers no chance of upward mobility. They acknowledge that the fulfillment of these three requirements is difficult as there is little data available to accurately test them.\n\nJennifer Lee adds to the discussion noting the particular niches and types of business immigrant groups enter. She notes that it is most common for immigrants to participate in long hours of physically demanding work in the retail industry. The retail market is a viable option due to the relatively low startup costs and knowledge of the host country's language required. Different niches have different levels of communication, for example the retail and self-service niche, (fruit and vegetable markets, take out restaurants) typically require the lowest level of customer interaction and communication. Lee notes the embeddedness of ethnic enclaves and brings the thought that such practices are good for those within the enclave but harmful to certain groups outside them. She also notes the adverse effects patterns of ethnic embeddedness can have on surrounding ethnic groups by noting the difficulty other groups face in joining the network. She argues that this type of retail niche domination can have positive consequences for co-ethnics, as Portes and Wilson believe, however can also have negative effects on surrounding ethnic groups who face exclusion due solely to their ethnic dissimilarity from the network.\n\nImmigration to the United States has occurred in waves that demonstrate the predominance of certain sets of ethnic minorities. As immigrants tended to cluster in certain cities and states, separate waves were responsible for the establishment of ethnic enclaves in separate physical spaces. In 1998, nearly three quarters of all immigrants in the United States lived in California, New York, Texas, Florida, New Jersey or Illinois. Housing discrimination remains a factor in the persistence of racial enclaves in American cities. However, more recent patterns of migration, such as chain migration, challenge traditional methods of enclaves establishment.\n\nThe increased supply of less-skilled immigrants raises concerns for the economic opportunities of the least-skilled natives. As the supply of low-wage workers increases, the wages for native workers who seek similar employment decrease. While native employees lose from lower wages, employers benefit from lower costs, which can lead to a decrease in the cost of the good for native consumers, with cheaper goods and services. That can cause increase of the gain to native-owned firms.\n\nOn the other hand, ethnic enclaves expand the size of the market, encouraging cross-cultural interactions and introducing Americans to a variety of foreign products and cuisines.\n\nEthnic enclaves have become commonplace in modern times, with the increase in the geographic mobility of humankind. However, they have also arisen in historical times, for various reasons. The village of Schandorf, now in Austria, was for centuries a Croatian ethnic enclave, surrounded by areas of Austrian and Hungarian ethnicity. The enclave originated around 1543 when the Hungarian magnate Batthyany sought to repopulate lands that had been emptied by devastating Turkish attacks; he invited Croatian settlers. The town of Alghero in Sardinia still marginally preserves a Catalan ethnic enclave; this dates from a military conquest of the town by Catalans in the 14th century. Ethnic enclaves also arose when a people remained in its original territory but came to be surrounded by a far more numerous majority, as in the case of Vepsians and Russians. \n\n"}
{"id": "570546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=570546", "title": "Evil Queen", "text": "Evil Queen\n\nThe Evil Queen, also called the Wicked Queen, is a fictional character and the main antagonist in \"Snow White\", a German fairy tale recorded by the Brothers Grimm; similar stories are also known to exist in other countries. Other versions of the Queen appear in \"Snow White\" derivative works, and the character has also become an archetype for unrelated works of fiction.\n\nThe Queen is Snow White's evil and vindictive stepmother who is obsessed with being \"the fairest in the land\". The beautiful young princess Snow White evokes the Queen's sense of envy, so the Queen designs a number of plans to kill Snow White through the use of witchcraft. A driving force in the story is the Queen's Magic Mirror. In the traditional resolution of the story, the Queen is grotesquely executed for her crimes. The tale is meant as a lesson for young children warning them against narcissism and pride.\n\nVarious other versions of the Queen appear in subsequent adaptations and continuations of the fairy tale, including novels and films. In these, the Queen is often re-imagined and sometimes portrayed more sympathetically, such as being morally conflicted or suffering from madness instead of being simply evil. In some of the revisionist stories she has even been portrayed as an antihero or a tragic hero. In some instances, she serves as the protagonist or narrator of the story; one such particularly notable version is Disney's, sometimes known as Queen Grimhilde. The Queen has also become an archetype that inspired several characters featured in the works that are not directly based on the original tale.\n\nThe Evil Queen is a very beautiful but proud and arrogant woman who is secretly dabbling in dark arts. When the King's first wife, the Good Queen passes away, Snow White's father marries again. The King's new and second wife is very beautiful, but she is also a wicked and vain woman who becomes the new and second Queen, and Snow White's stepmother. She owns a magic mirror, which one day informs her that her young stepdaughter Princess Snow White has surpassed her in beauty. After deciding to eliminate Snow White, the Queen orders her Huntsman to take the princess into the forest and kill her. The Queen tells him to bring back Snow White's lungs and liver, as proof that the princess is dead. However, the Huntsman takes pity on Snow White, and instead, brings the Queen the lungs and liver of a wild boar. The Queen then eats what she believes are Snow White's organs.\n\nWhile questioning her mirror, the Queen discovers that Snow White has survived. Intending to kill Snow White herself, she uses witchcraft to prepare poison and take the disguise of an old peddler woman. She visits the dwarfs' house and sells Snow White laces for a corset that she laces too tight in an attempt to asphyxiate the girl. When that fails, the Queen returns, as a different old woman, and tricks Snow White into using a poisoned comb. When the comb fails to kill Snow White, the Queen again visits Snow White, this time disguised as a farmer's wife, and gives Snow White a poisoned apple.\n\nEventually, Snow White and the Prince from another kingdom reveal the Queen's true nature and invite her to their wedding, where she is forced to put on red-hot iron shoes and \"dance\" until she drops dead.\n\nIn the classic ending of \"Snow White\", the Evil Queen is tricked into attending Snow White's wedding and put to death by torment; this is often considered to be too dark and potentially horrifying for children in modern society. Sara Maitland wrote that \"we do not tell this part of the story any more; we say it is too cruel and will break children's soft hearts.\" Therefore, many (especially modern) revisions of the fairy tale often change the gruesome classic ending in order to make it seem less violent. In some versions, instead of dying, the Queen is even just merely prevented from committing further wrongdoings. However, in the same 2014 nationwide UK poll that considered the Queen from \"Snow White\" the scariest fairy tale character of all time (as cited by 32.21% of responding adults), around two thirds opined that today's stories are too \"sanitised\" for children.\n\nAlready the first English translation of the Grimms' tale, written by Edgar Taylor in 1823, has the Queen choke on her own envy upon the sight of Snow White alive. Another early (1871) English translation by Susannah Mary Paull \"replaces the Queen's death by cruel physical punishment with death by self-inflicted pain and self-destruction\" when it was her own shoes that became hot due to her anger. Other alternative endings can have the Queen just instantly drop dead \"of anger\" at the wedding or in front of her mirror upon learning about it, die from her own designs going awry (such as from touching her own poisoned rose) or by nature (such as falling into quicksands while crossing a swamp on her way back after poisoning Snow White), be killed by the dwarfs during a chase, be destroyed by her own mirror, run away into the forest never to be seen again, or simply being banished from the kingdom forever.\n\nThe Evil Queen's origins can be traced to the character of Silver-Tree, a jealous queen who threatens her daughter, in the Celtic oral tale \"Gold-Tree and Silver-Tree\". According to Kenny Klein, the enchantress Ceridwen of the Welsh mythology was \"the quintissential evil stepmother, the origin of that character in the two tales of Snow White and Cinderella\". Oliver Madox Hueffer noted that the wicked stepmother with magical powers threatening a young princess is a recurring theme in fairy tales; one similar character is the witch-queen in \"The Wild Swans\" as told by Hans Christian Andersen.\n\nRosemary Ellen Guiley suggests that the Queen uses an apple because it recalls the temptation of Eve; this creation story from the Bible led the Christian Church to view apples as a symbol of sin. Many people feared that apples could carry evil spirits, and that witches used them for poisoning. Robert G. Brown of Duke University also makes a connection with the story of Adam and Eve, seeing the Queen as a representation of the archetype of Lilith. The symbol of an apple has long had traditional associations with enchantment and witchcraft in some European cultures, as in case of Morgan le Fay's Avalon (\"Isle of the Apples\").\n\nIn some Scottish versions of \"Snow White\"-type fairy tales, a talking trout takes the place of the Queen's mirror, the Queen is the princess' biological mother, rather than her stepmother, the huntsman figure is the princess' own father, and the Queen's fate remains unresolved. The tale varies widely from place to place, with the Queen using various tricks against the princess. For example, in Italy, the Queen uses a toxic comb, a contaminated cake, or a suffocating braid. The Queen's demands of proof from the huntsman (often her lover in non-Grimm versions) also vary: a bottle of blood stoppered with the princess' toe in Spain, or the princess' intestines and blood-soaked shirt in Italy. In France, a local tale features a poisoned tomato. One of the early variations of the tale was Giambattista Basile's \"The Young Slave\".\n\nThe Grimm brothers invented the motif of the Queen's execution at Snow White's wedding; the original story sees her punished by the King. The Grimms noted on the margin of their 1810 manuscript: \"The ending is not quite right and is lacking something.\" Diane Purkiss attributes the Queen's fiery death to \"the folkbelief that burning a witch's body ended her power, a belief which subtended (but did not cause) the practice of burning witches in Germany\", while the American Folklore Society noted that the use of iron shoes \"recalls folk practices of destroying a witch through the magic agency of iron\".\n\nThe Brothers Grimm collected the German fairy tale in their 1812 \"Kinder- und Hausmärchen\" (\"Children's and Household Tales\", more commonly known in English as \"Grimms' Fairy Tales\"). In the first edition of the Brothers Grimm story, the Queen is Snow White's biological mother, not her stepmother. This motif changed in subsequent versions, after 1819. The earliest version was known as \"Snow Drop\". Jack Zipes said \"the change from 'evil mother' to 'evil stepmother' for example, was because the brothers 'held motherhood sacred'. According to Sheldon Cashdan, Professor of Psychology at the University of Massachusetts, a \"cardinal rule of fairy tales\" mandates that the \"heroes and heroines are allowed to kill witches, sorceresses, even stepmothers, but never their own mothers\". Zipes' 2014 collection of Grimm fairy tales in their original forms reinstated the Queen as Snow White's mother.\n\nAccording to some scholars, the story is constructed and characters are presented with ageist undertones. The University of Hawaii professor Cristina Bacchilega said, \"I think there is still very much an attachment to vilifying the older, more powerful woman.\" Roger Sale opined that \"the term 'narcissism' seems altogether too slippery to be the only one we want here. There is, for instance, no suggestion that the queen's absorption in her beauty ever gives her pleasure, or that the desire for power through sexual attractiveness is itself a sexual feeling. What is stressed is the anger and fear that attend the queen's realization that as she and Snow White both get older, she must lose. This is why the major feeling involved is not jealousy but envy: to make beauty that important is to reduce the world to one in which only two people count.\" Terri Windling wrote that the Queen is \"a woman whose power is derived from her beauty; it is this, the tale implies, that provides her place in the castle's hierarchy. If the king’s attention turns from his wife to another, what power is left to an aging woman? Witchcraft, the tale answers. Potions, poisons, and self-protection.\" According to Zipes, \"the queen's actions are determined by the mirror's representations of her as exemplifying beauty and evil, or associating evil and vanity with beauty, and these mirror representations are taken as the truth by the queen. Had she perhaps doubted and cracked the mirror, cracked the meaning of the mirror, she might still be alive today.\" Deborah Lipp, discussing the character's archetype, stated that \"in fact Western culture had, for hundreds of years, associated the idea of powerful, commanding women with witchcraft and evil. That's why, I think, the most interesting women in stories have been villainesses.\" Zipes opined that the Queen character is much more complex and \"as a figure she is much more fascinating than this dumb, innocent, naïve Snow White. So why not focus on this figure who is tragic in many, many ways. We really don't know too much about her - where she gets her powers. She's mysterious.\"\n\nSandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar regard Snow White and her mother/stepmother as two female stereotypes, the angel and the monster. The fact that the Queen was Snow White's biological mother in the first version of the Grimms' story has led several psychoanalytic critics to interpret \"Snow White\" as a story about repressed Oedipus complex, or about Snow White's Electra complex. Harold Bloom opined that the three \"temptations\" all \"testify to a mutual sexual attraction between Snow White and her stepmother.\" According to Bruno Bettelheim, the story's main motif is \"the clash of sexual innocence and sexual desire\" and Cashdan wrote that the Queen's \"incessant query, 'Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?' literally reflects her fear that the king will find Snow White more appealing than her. It thus is the implicit sexual struggle between the young girl and the queen.\" This struggle is so dominating the psychological landscape of the tale, that Gilber and Gubar even proposed renaming the story \"Snow White and Her Wicked Stepmother\".\n\nAccording to Bettelheim, \"only the death of the jealous queen (the elimination of all outer and inner turbulence) can make for a happy world.\" Cashdan opined \"the death of the witch signals a victory of virtue over vice, a sign that positive forces in the self have prevailed,\" and \"the active involvement of heroine in the witch's demise communicates to readers that they must take an active role in overcoming their own errant tendencies.\" The evil queen \"embodies narcissism, and the young princess, with whom readers identify, embodies parts of the child struggling to overcome this tendency. Vanquishing the queen represents a triumph of positive forces in the self over vain impulses.\" According to Cashdan, \"her death constitutes the emotional core of the tale\" as the story could easily end with the resurrection of Snow White, \"but there is one detail that needs to be resolved: the wicked queen is still alive. Her continued existence means not only that Snow White's life remains in jeopardy, but that the princess is apt to be plagued by vain temptations for the rest of her days. Unless the evil woman is eliminated once and for all, Snow White will never be free.\" Similarly, the psychologist Betsy Cohen wrote that \"in order to avoid becoming a wicked queen herself, Snow White needs to separate from and kill off this destructive force inside of her. The death of the wicked queen allows Snow White to truly celebrate her marriage, the bringing together of herself.\" Cohen further wrote that \"the queen was forced to face her own mortality, the inevitability of death. As Snow White rids herself of her envious stepmother, she is, at the same time, next in line to become a mother herself—more able, we hope, to deal with envy than her stepmother had been.\"\n\nRegarding the manner of the Queen's execution, Jo Eldridge Carney, Professor of English at The College of New Jersey, wrote: \"Again, the fairy tale's system of punishment is horrific but apt: a woman so actively consumed with seeking affirmation from others and with violently undoing her rival is forced to enact her own physical destruction as a public spectacle.\" According to Sheldon Donald Haase, Professor of German, and Associate Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Wayne State University, \"a measure of justice is achieved\" with \"the sadistic punishment to some extent fitting the crime. The glowing shoes, an appropriate symbol for her own unbridled envy, bring about her final demise.\" Likewise, Mary Ayers of the Stanford University School of Medicine wrote that the red-hot shoes symbolise that the Queen was \"subjected to the effects of her own inflamed, searing hot envy and hatred.\" It was also noted that this ending echoes the fairy tale of \"The Red Shoes\", which similarly \"warns of the danger of attachment to appearances.\"\n\nJohn Hanson Saunders of the Pennsylvania State University wrote that the Queen's \"rather barbaric...torture and death gives closure to the reader and the death seems more fitting...Her death can provide justice and allows the audience to see good triumph over evil.\" Cashdan argued that, from a psychological viewpoint, the Queen could not flee or get merely locked up in a dungeon or exiled, as the story has portrayed her \"as a thoroughly despicable creature who deserves the worst conceivable punishment.\" Furthermore, he claims \"such a horrible death\" is necessary because, like in several other fairy tales, \"if the witch is to die — and remain dead — she must die in a way that makes her return highly unlikely,\" and so \"the reader needs to know that the death of the witch is thorough and complete, even if it means exposing young readers to acts of violence that are extreme by contemporary standards.\" On the other hand, Oliver Madox Hueffer wrote that \"it is impossible not to feel a certain sympathy with this unfortunate royal lady in her subsequent fate.\" According to Sharna Olfman, Professor of Psychology at the Point Park University, \"when reading or listening to stories, children aren't assaulted with precreated graphic visual imagery. They don't have to see close-ups of...the agony of pain in the queen's eyes as she dances to her death.\" Nevertheless, Olfman's personal preference is to \"skip the torture scenes when I read these stories to kids.\" Anthony Burgess commented: \"Reading that, how seriously can we take it? It is fairy-tale violence, which is not like real mugging, terrorism and Argentinean torture.\" \n\nThe character was portrayed in a variety of ways in the subsequent adaptations and reimaginations of the classic fairy tale. According to Lana Berkowitz of the \"Houston Chronicle\", \"Today stereotypes of the evil queen and innocent Snow White often are challenged. Rewrites may show the queen is reacting to extenuating circumstances.\" Scott Meslow of \"The Atlantic\" noted that \"Disney's decision to throw out the Grimms's appropriately grim ending—which sentences the evil queen to dance in heated iron shoes until her death—has meant that ending is all but forgotten.\"\n\nActresses who have played the Wicked Queen in \"Snow White\" stage productions (usually pantomime plays) have included Stephanie Beacham, Lucy Benjamin, Andrée Bernard (as Queen Lacretia), Jennifer Ellison, Jade Goody, Jerry Hall, Lesley Joseph, Patsy Kensit, Josie Lawrence (as Morgiana the Wicked Queen), Joanne Malin, Vicki Michelle, Denise Nolan, Su Pollard, Priscilla Presley, Liz Robertson, and Toyah Willcox. The role was also played by \"Lily Savage\" (Paul O'Grady) and Craig Revel Horwood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Disney version of the characters also appears in variety of other Disney media, also making some cameo appearances in other works such as the 1977 film \"Annie Hall\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "184421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184421", "title": "FOXP2", "text": "FOXP2\n\nForkhead box protein P2 (FOXP2) is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the \"FOXP2\" gene, also known as \"CAGH44\", \"SPCH1\" or \"TNRC10\", and is required for proper development of speech and language. The gene is shared with many vertebrates, where it generally plays a role in communication (for instance, the development of bird song).\n\nInitially identified as the genetic factor of speech disorder in KE family, \"FOXP2\" is the first gene discovered associated with speech and language. The gene is located on chromosome 7 (7q31, at the \"SPCH1\" locus) and is expressed in fetal and adult brain, heart, lung and gut. \"FOXP2\" orthologs have also been identified in other mammals for which complete genome data are available. The \"FOXP2\" protein contains a forkhead-box DNA-binding domain, making it a member of the FOX group of transcription factors, involved in regulation of gene expression. In addition to this characteristic forkhead-box domain, the protein contains a polyglutamine tract, a zinc finger and a leucine zipper. The gene is more active in females than in males, to which could be attributed better language learning in females.\n\nIn humans, mutations of \"FOXP2\" cause a severe speech and language disorder. Versions of \"FOXP2\" exist in similar forms in distantly related vertebrates; functional studies of the gene in mice and in songbirds indicate that it is important for modulating plasticity of neural circuits. Outside the brain \"FOXP2\" has also been implicated in development of other tissues such as the lung and gut.\n\n\"FOXP2\" is popularly dubbed the \"language gene\", but this is only partly correct since there are other genes involved in language development. It directly regulates a number of other genes, including \"CNTNAP2\", \"CTBP1\", and \"SRPX2\".\n\nTwo amino acid substitutions distinguish the human \"FOXP2\" protein from that found in chimpanzees, but only one of these changes is unique to humans. Evidence from genetically manipulated mice and human neuronal cell models suggests that these changes affect the neural functions of \"FOXP2\".\n\n\"FOXP2\" and its gene were discovered as a result of investigations on an English family known as the KE family, half of whom (fifteen individuals across three generations) suffered from a speech and language disorder called developmental verbal dyspraxia. Their case was studied at the Institute of Child Health of University College London. In 1990 Myrna Gopnik, Professor of Linguistics at McGill University, reported that the disorder-affected KE family had severe speech impediment with incomprehensible talk, largely characterized by grammatical deficits. She hypothesized that the basis was not of learning or cognitive disability, but due to genetic factors affecting mainly grammatical ability. (Her hypothesis led to a popularised existence of \"grammar gene\" and a controversial notion of grammar-specific disorder.) In 1995, the University of Oxford and the Institute of Child Health researchers found that the disorder was purely genetic. Remarkably, the inheritance of the disorder from one generation to the next was consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance, i.e., mutation of only a single gene on an autosome (non-sex chromosome) acting in a dominant fashion. This is one of the few known examples of Mendelian (monogenic) inheritance for a disorder affecting speech and language skills, which typically have a complex basis involving multiple genetic risk factors.\n\nIn 1998, Oxford University geneticists Simon Fisher, Anthony Monaco, Cecilia S. L. Lai, Jane A. Hurst, and Faraneh Vargha-Khadem identified an autosomal dominant monogenic inheritance that is localized on a small region of chromosome 7 from DNA samples taken from the affected and unaffected members. The chromosomal region (locus) contained 70 genes. The locus was given the official name \"SPCH1\" (for speech-and-language-disorder-1) by the Human Genome Nomenclature committee. Mapping and sequencing of the chromosomal region was performed with the aid of bacterial artificial chromosome clones. Around this time, the researchers identified an individual who was unrelated to the KE family, but had a similar type of speech and language disorder. In this case the child, known as CS, carried a chromosomal rearrangement (a translocation) in which part of chromosome 7 had become exchanged with part of chromosome 5. The site of breakage of chromosome 7 was located within the SPCH1 region.\n\nIn 2001, the team identified in CS that the mutation is in the middle of a protein-coding gene. Using a combination of bioinformatics and RNA analyses, they discovered that the gene codes for a novel protein belonging to the forkhead-box (FOX) group of transcription factors. As such, it was assigned with the official name of FOXP2. When the researchers sequenced the \"FOXP2\" gene in the KE family, they found a heterozygous point mutation shared by all the affected individuals, but not in unaffected members of the family and other people. This mutation is due to an amino-acid substitution that inhibits the DNA-binding domain of the \"FOXP2\" protein. Further screening of the gene identified multiple additional cases of \"FOXP2\" disruption, including different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, providing evidence that damage to one copy of this gene is sufficient to derail speech and language development.\n\n\"FOXP2\" is required for proper brain and lung development. Knockout mice with only one functional copy of the \"FOXP2\" gene have significantly reduced vocalizations as pups. Knockout mice with no functional copies of \"FOXP2\" are runted, display abnormalities in brain regions such as the Purkinje layer, and die an average of 21 days after birth from inadequate lung development.\n\n\"FOXP2\" is expressed in many areas of the brain including the basal ganglia and inferior frontal cortex where it is essential for brain maturation and speech and language development.\n\nA knockout mouse model has been used to examine \"FOXP2\"'s role in brain development and how mutations in the two copies of \"FOXP2\" affect vocalization. Mutations in one copy result in reduced speech while abnormalities in both copies cause major brain and lung developmental issues.\n\nThe expression of \"FOXP2\" is subject to post-transcriptional regulation, particularly micro RNA, which binds to multiple miRNA binding-sites in the neocortex, causing the repression of FOXP2 3’UTR.\n\nThere are several abnormalities linked to \"FOXP2\". The most common mutation results in severe speech impairment known as developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD) which is caused by a translocation in the 7q31.2 region [t(5;7)(q22;q31.2)]. A missense mutation causing an arginine-to-histidine substitution (R553H) in the DNA-binding domain is thought to be the abnormality in KE. A heterozygous nonsense mutation, R328X variant, produces a truncated protein involved in speech and language difficulties in one KE individual and two of their close family members. R553H and R328X mutations also affected nuclear localization, DNA-binding, and the transactivation (increased gene expression) properties of \"FOXP2\". Although DVD associated with \"FOXP2\" disruptions are thought to be rare (~2% by one estimate), genetic links from \"FOXP2\" to disease usually relate to speech or language problems. \n\nSeveral cases of developmental verbal dyspraxia in humans have been linked to mutations in the \"FOXP2\" gene. Such individuals have little or no cognitive handicap but are unable to correctly perform the coordinated movements required for speech. fMRI analysis of these individuals performing silent verb generation and spoken word repetition tasks showed underactivation of Broca's area and the putamen, brain centers thought to be involved in language tasks. Because of this, \"FOXP2\" has been dubbed the \"language gene\". People with this mutation also experience symptoms not related to language (not surprisingly, as \"FOXP2\" is known to affect development in other parts of the body as well). Scientists have also looked for associations between \"FOXP2\" and autism, and both positive and negative findings have been reported.\n\nThere is some evidence that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the \"FOXP2\" gene are not simply the result of a fundamental deficit in motor control. For examples, the impairments include difficulties in comprehension. Brain imaging of affected individuals indicates functional abnormalities in language-related cortical and basal/ganglia regions, demonstrating that the problems extend beyond the motor system.\n\nThe \"FOXP2\" gene is highly conserved in mammals. The human gene differs from that in non-human primates by the substitution of two amino acids, a threonine to asparagine substitution at position 303 (T303N) and an asparagine to serine substitution at position 325 (N325S). In mice it differs from that of humans by three substitutions, and in zebra finch by seven amino acids. One of the two amino acid differences between human and chimps also arose independently in carnivores and bats. Similar \"FOXP2\" proteins can be found in songbirds, fish, and reptiles such as alligators.\n\nDNA sampling from \"Homo neanderthalensis\" bones indicates that their \"FOXP2\" gene is a little different, though largely similar to those of \"Homo sapiens\" (i.e. humans). \n\nThe \"FOXP2\" gene showed indications of recent positive selection. Some researchers have speculated that positive selection is crucial for the evolution of language in humans. Others, however, have been unable to find a clear association between species with learned vocalizations and similar mutations in \"FOXP2\". Recent data from a large sample of globally distributed genomes showed no evidence of positive selection, suggesting that the original signal of positive selection may be driven by sample composition. Insertion of both human mutations into mice, whose version of \"FOXP2\" otherwise differs from the human and chimpanzee versions in only one additional base pair, causes changes in vocalizations as well as other behavioral changes, such as a reduction in exploratory tendencies, and a decrease in maze learning time. A reduction in dopamine levels and changes in the morphology of certain nerve cells are also observed.\n\nHowever, \"FOXP2\" is extremely diverse in echolocating bats. Twenty-two sequences of non-bat eutherian mammals revealed a total number of 20 nonsynonymous mutations in contrast to half that number of bat sequences, which showed 44 nonsynonymous mutations. All cetaceans share three amino acid substitutions, but no differences were found between echolocating toothed whales and non-echolocating baleen cetaceans. Within bats, however, amino acid variation correlated with different echolocating types.\n\n\"FOXP2\" interacts with a regulatory gene \"CTBP1\". It also downregulates \"CNTNAP2\" gene, a member of the neurexin family found in neurons. The target gene is associated with common forms of language impairment. It regulates the repeat-containing protein X-linked 2 (\"SRPX2\"), which is an epilepsy and language-associated gene in humans, and sound-controlling gene in mice.\n\nIn a mouse \"FOXP2\" knockout study, loss of both copies of the gene caused severe motor impairment related to cerebellar abnormalities and lack of ultrasonic vocalisations normally elicited when pups are removed from their mothers. These vocalizations have important communicative roles in mother-offspring interactions. Loss of one copy was associated with impairment of ultrasonic vocalisations and a modest developmental delay. Male mice on encountering female mice produce complex ultrasonic vocalisations that have characteristics of song. Mice that have the R552H point mutation carried by the KE family show cerebellar reduction and abnormal synaptic plasticity in striatal and cerebellar circuits.\n\nIn songbirds, \"FOXP2\" most likely regulates genes involved in neuroplasticity.\nGene knockdown of \"FOXP2\" in Area X of the basal ganglia in songbirds results in incomplete and inaccurate song imitation. Overexpression of FoxP2 was accomplished through injection of adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) into Area X of the brain. This overexpression produced similar effects to that of knockdown; juvenile zebra finch birds were unable to accurately imitate their tutors. Similarly, in adult canaries higher \"FOXP2\" levels also correlate with song changes.\n\nLevels of \"FOXP2\" in adult zebra finches are significantly higher when males direct their song to females than when they sing song in other contexts. “Directed” singing refers to when a male is singing to a female usually for a courtship display. “Undirected” singing occurs when for example, a male sings when other males are present or is alone. Studies have found that FoxP2 levels vary depending on the social context. When the birds were singing undirected song, there was a decrease of FoxP2 expression in Area X. This downregulation was not observed and FoxP2 levels remained stable in birds singing directed song.\n\nDifferences between song-learning and non-song-learning birds have been shown to be caused by differences in \"FOXP2\" gene expression, rather than differences in the amino acid sequence of the \"FOXP2\" protein.\n\n\"FOXP2\" also has possible implications in the development of bat echolocation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53251617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53251617", "title": "Far-right subcultures", "text": "Far-right subcultures\n\nFar-Right subcultures refers to the symbolism, values and traits that hold relevance to various politically extreme right-wing groups and organisations. There are three kinds of subcultures within far-right movements to distinguish: subcultural parasitism, subcultural creation around ideology and subcultures that are networking with far-right movements, as some football hooligans did with neo-nazis.\n\nFar-right ideologists try to infiltrate subcultures to spread their ideas amongst them. These attempts are defined as subcultural parasitism. The probably most known subculture, which got taken over by the far-right and neo-nazis is the Skinhead scene, which started originally in Great Britain. Some examples for subculture parasitism: the Nipster, infiltration of the Hipster (contemporary subculture) by neo-nazis (Nazi Hipster), Nazi punk, infiltration of the Heavy metal subculture, known as National Socialist black metal (NSBM/NSCH). Subcultures as the Goth subculture and the Hip Hop subculture got also infiltrated by far-right movements and ideologists. Some other examples for far-right or neo-Nazi subcultures: Esoteric Nazism and Nazi Satanism.\n\nThere is another strategy of neo-nazis and far right movements, that is called cultural subversion. This strategy uses already existing forms of expression and organization and fills them with far right meaning. Some examples: \n\nDuring the regime the National Fascist Party heavily influenced fashion in the pursuit for autarchy and the importance of aesthetics and symbolism: clothes had to be produced in Italy and had to reflect the values of the Italian people. Pieces of clothing such as the black shirts became associated with the dreaded Volunteer Militia for the Safety of the Nation and even to the regime itself. \nNowadays neo-fascists still care a great deal about clothing, but with different approaches. Symbols and clothes like the Celtic Cross and the black clothing are still present and associated to the new filo-fascists political parties and movements, but, similarly to the neo-nazism case, there has also been a growing interest in \"trendiness\" and fashion, with new clothing brands that offer casual and formal clothing more in line with today's consumerist culture. This has led to three different types of brands usage by the neo-fascist subculture that still cares a big deal about clothing as a way to show their political affiliation, while caring about what is trendy as well:\n\nThe arbitrary appropriation of modern devices of today's consumer culture in addition to the ones typical of its \"ancestor\" in Neo-fascism is not just limited to fashion, examples of modern culture products that were not born with this political affiliation but were used by neo-fascists to frame their values and the adherence of its affiliates to them are Tolkien's novels, which led to the \"Campi Hobbit\" (Hobbit Camps) experience: real political camps where space was given to topics often overlooked by typical political institutions, with right wing music groups, visual artists, radio podcasts performances and social issues discussions about topics such as young people's unemployment together with paramilitary activities being carried out. Another very famous example is the politicization of football, with the Ultras groups often affiliated with certain ideologies. The majority of ultras groups in fact present small \"bands\" within them that are openly neo-fascist or at least far-right extremists, with groups such as Hellas Verona's \"Brigate Gialloblu\" or Juventus' \"Vikings\" having an infamous record of violence episodes, which are not related to the sport nor their supported teams' ideals.\n\n\n\"Main Article\": Identitarian Movement\n\nThe Identitarian movement is one of the most renowned far-right youth culture in Germany and part of the New Right. Within the New Right it has four unique position features: youthfulness, excessive desire for action, pop culture and Corporate Identity. The German Identitarian movement uses Facebook as its main platform, where it spreads quotations of famous thinkers of the Conservative Revolutionary movement such as Ernst Jünger and Carl Schmitt, articles of the far-right journal \"Sezession\" and videos of various campaigns.\n\n\"Main Article\": Alt-Right\n\nAlso referred to as the alternative right, the alt-right is a recent political movement which holds strong views on a wide array of political, cultural, racial and religious subjects, with a central theme being white supremacy and white nationalism. The political movement of the American Alternative Right is a political movement that has gained significant prominence since the buildup to the consequent election of Donald Trump in the 2016 US election. The typical alt-right supporter is a white US citizen, most likely of a family lineage without recent immigration to the USA. While there are numerous recorded cases of anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim behaviour and supporters to be of predominantly Christian background, personal religious disposition does not prove to be of great importance beyond those which are discriminated against.\n\nSince Donald Trump's victory in November 2016, the exposure and symbolism associated with the alt-right has become more distinct. In mid-November 2016 at an alt-right conference with approximately 200 people in Washington, D.C. One of the speakers at this event was president of the National Policy Institute and white supremacist; Richard Spencer. Audience members cheered and gave the Nazi salute when he said, \"Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!\" The parallel theme of cultural purity combined with the totalitarian and ominous connotations associated with Nazi history provide an aesthetic appeal to the themes and ideas of the alt-right. Due to the highly superficial nature of the group, understanding of the key concepts behind these other far-right political movements is secondary to the imagery and visual culture associated with them.\n\nFashion label abuse means in this case, far-right movements, use specific labels and connect their ideology. Some prominent examples are Lonsdale, Fred Perry and New Balance. The British sport label Lonsdale became popular in the German neo-nazi movement because of the letters 'NSDA' in the name, which refers to the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP, Nazi Party), that was active between 1920 and 1945. The popularity of Fred Perry can be explained through the demand in the skinhead scene. On top of that the brand offers polo shirts with a collar in the colors black-white-red, which was the flag color used by the nazi regime and is therefore as well prominent in German neo-nazi movements. Both brands distance themselves from any association. In November 2016 Matthew LeBretton, New Balance's vice president of public affairs, criticized the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, that the Obama administration led and Donald Trump opposes. After New Balance defended its opposition to TTP, Andrew Anglin, publisher of the American neo-nazi news and commentary website The Daily Stormer, declared New Balance the “Official Shoes of White People”.\n\nThere are also fashion labels that got created for neo-nazis, by neo-nazis.\nSome examples for nazi fashion labels: Ansgar Aryan, Consdaple, Eric and Sons, Masterrace Europe, Outlaw, Reconquista, Rizist, Thor Steinar, Troublemaker, Dryve by Suizhyde, Greifvogel Wear, Hate-Hate, Hermannsland, Sport Frei, Pro Violence.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}
{"id": "18949461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18949461", "title": "Fiction", "text": "Fiction\n\nFiction broadly refers to any narrative that is derived from the imagination—in other words, not based strictly on history or fact. It can also refer, more narrowly, to narratives written only in prose (the novel and short story), and is often used as a synonym for the novel.\n\nIn its most narrow usage fiction refers to novels, but it may also denote any \"literary narrative\" (see literary fiction), including novels, novellas, and short stories. More broadly, fiction has come to encompass imaginative storytelling in any format, including writings, theatrical performances, comics, films, television programs, animations, games (most notably, video games and role-playing games), and so on.\n\nA work of fiction implies the inventive act of constructing an imaginary world, so its audience does not typically expect it to be totally faithful to the real world in presenting only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. Instead, the context of fiction, generally understood as not adhering precisely to the real world, is more open to interpretation. Characters and events within a fictional work may even be set in their own context entirely separate from the known universe: an independent fictional universe.\n\nFiction's traditional opposite is non-fiction, a narrative work whose creator assumes responsibility for presenting only the historical and factual truth. The distinction between fiction and non-fiction however can be unclear in some recent artistic and literary movements, such as postmodern literature.\n\nTraditionally, fiction includes novels, short stories, fables, legends, myths, fairy tales, epic and narrative poetry, plays (including operas, musicals, dramas, puppet plays, and various kinds of theatrical dances). However, fiction may also encompass comic books, and many animated cartoons, stop motions, anime, manga, films, video games, radio programs, television programs (comedies and dramas), etc.\n\nThe Internet has had a major impact on the creation and distribution of fiction, calling into question the feasibility of copyright as a means to ensure royalties are paid to copyright holders. Also, digital libraries such as Project Gutenberg make public domain texts more readily available. The combination of inexpensive home computers, the Internet and the creativity of its users has also led to new forms of fiction, such as interactive computer games or computer-generated comics. Countless forums for fan fiction can be found online, where loyal followers of specific fictional realms create and distribute derivative stories. The Internet is also used for the development of blog fiction, where a story is delivered through a blog either as flash fiction or serial blog, and collaborative fiction, where a story is written sequentially by different authors, or the entire text can be revised by anyone using a wiki.\n\nTypes of literary fiction in prose include:\n\nFiction is commonly broken down into a variety of genres: subsets of fiction, each differentiated by a particular unifying tone or style, narrative technique, media content, or popularly defined criterion. Science fiction, for example, predicts or supposes technologies that are not realities at the time of the work's creation: Jules Verne's novel \"From the Earth to the Moon\" was published in 1865 and only in 1969 did astronaut Neil Armstrong first land on the moon.\n\nHistorical fiction places imaginary characters into real historical events. In the early historical novel \"Waverley\", Sir Walter Scott's fictional character Edward Waverley meets a figure from history, Bonnie Prince Charlie, and takes part in the Battle of Prestonpans. Some works of fiction are slightly or greatly re-imagined based on some originally true story, or a reconstructed biography. Often, even when the fictional story is based on fact, there may be additions and subtractions from the true story to make it more interesting. An example is Tim O'Brien's \"The Things They Carried\", a series of short stories about the Vietnam War.\n\nFictional works that explicitly involve supernatural, magical, or scientifically impossible elements are often classified under the genre of fantasy, including Lewis Carroll's \"Alice In Wonderland\", J. K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" series, and J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". Creators of fantasy sometimes introduce imaginary creatures and beings such as dragons and fairies.\n\nLiterary fiction is a term used in the book-trade to distinguish novels that are regarded as having literary merit, from most commercial or \"genre\" fiction.\n\nNeal Stephenson has suggested that while any definition will be simplistic there is today a general cultural difference between literary and genre fiction. On the one hand literary authors nowadays are frequently supported by patronage, with employment at a university or a similar institution, and with the continuation of such positions determined not by book sales but by critical acclaim by other established literary authors and critics. On the other hand, he suggests, genre fiction writers tend to support themselves by book sales. However, in an interview, John Updike lamented that \"the category of 'literary fiction' has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books, and if anybody wanted to read them, terrific, the more the merrier. ... I'm a genre writer of a sort. I write literary fiction, which is like spy fiction or chick lit\". Likewise, on \"The Charlie Rose Show\", he argued that this term, when applied to his work, greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing, so he does not really like it. He suggested that all his works are literary, simply because \"they are written in words\".\n\nLiterary fiction often involves social commentary, political criticism, or reflection on the human condition. In general it focuses on \"introspective, in-depth character studies\" of \"interesting, complex and developed\" characters. This contrasts with genre fiction where plot is the central concern. Usually in literary fiction the focus is on the \"inner story\" of the characters who drive the plot, with detailed motivations to elicit \"emotional involvement\" in the reader. The style of literary fiction is often described as \"elegantly written, lyrical, and ... layered\". The tone of literary fiction can be darker than genre fiction, while the pacing of literary fiction may be slower than popular fiction. As Terrence Rafferty notes, \"literary fiction, by its nature, allows itself to dawdle, to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way\".\n\nRealistic fiction typically involves a story whose basic setting (time and location in the world) is real and whose events could feasibly happen in a real-world setting; non-realistic fiction involves a story where the opposite is the case, often being set in an entirely imaginary universe, an alternative history of the world other than that currently understood as true, or some other non-existent location or time-period, sometimes even presenting impossible technology or a defiance of the currently understood laws of nature. However, all types of fiction arguably invite their audience to explore real ideas, issues, or possibilities in an otherwise imaginary setting, or using what is understood about reality to mentally construct something similar to reality, though still distinct from it.\n\nIn terms of the traditional separation between fiction and non-fiction, the lines are now commonly understood as blurred, showing more overlap than mutual exclusion. Even fiction usually has elements of, or grounding in, truth. The distinction between the two may be best defined from the perspective of the audience, according to whom a work is regarded as non-fiction if its people, places, and events are all historically or factually real, while a work is regarded as fiction if it deviates from reality in any of those areas. The distinction between fiction and non-fiction is further obscured by an understanding, on the one hand, that the truth can be presented through imaginary channels and constructions, while, on the other hand, imagination can just as well bring about significant conclusions about truth and reality.\n\nLiterary critic James Wood, argues that \"fiction is both artifice and verisimilitude\", meaning that it requires both creative invention as well as some acceptable degree of believability, a notion often encapsulated in poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge's term: willing suspension of disbelief. Also, infinite fictional possibilities themselves signal the impossibility of fully knowing reality, provocatively demonstrating that there is no criterion to measure constructs of reality.\n\n\n\n"}

It stars Sutton Foster, Jimmi Simpson, Lily Cole, Gabriel Luna, Gabourey Sidibe, Lothaire Bluteau, James Roday, Paul Rodriguez, Michael Weston, Molly Ephraim, and Sarah Silverman. The film was released in the United States on October 2, 2015 by Scream Factory.\n\nIt's All Hallow's Eve. Anson (Michael Weston) enters a convenience store where he buys sorbet and flirts with the cashier, Bethany (Sarah Silverman). Nearby the employees of a Mexican Cantina & Bar, waitress Cricket (Molly Ephraim), bartender Kerry (Sutton Foster), cook Yannick (Lothaire Bluteau), busboy Hector (Gabriel Luna), manager Chuy (Paul Rodriguez), and security guard Winketta (Gabourey Sidibe) close up the Cantina and have a small party celebrating Kerry, who is leaving to become a paramedic. As the party wraps up the employees discover the doors have been welded shut and the phone lines are cut. Anson, his brother Stef (Jimmi Simpson), and Stef's girlfriend Mimi (Lily Cole) (the latter two having been at a table making out earlier) then appear and quickly take the employees hostage, tying them to chairs. Apparently uninterested in money, their true intentions soon become clear - they are sadists and cannibals, who plan to torture and eat the various employees.\n\nStef soon chains up Yannick in the kitchen to cook the various employees as they are dispatched in different sick and sadistic games. After the trio eat Chuy, Kerry pretends to be romantically interested in Anson to gain his trust, and comes onto him while retrieving a list of items from the pantry for Yannick to cook with.\n\nHowever while eating Winketta's corpse Stef starts to experience anaphylactic shock, and realizes Yannick has snuck basil into his food, which he had forbid earlier as he is highly allergic. Examining the list of items he realizes that Yannick used the Army of Portugal cipher to tell Kerry to bring him basil. While Stef and Yannick start fighting each other, in the other room Hector has managed to free himself and Cricket. Anson and Hector square off upstairs while Cricket and Kerry fight Mimi. Back in the kitchen, after a long battle with both parties sustaining horrible wounds, Stef manages to kill Yannick. Mimi kills Cricket, but Kerry manages to kill her, and just as it appears Hector will kill Anson, Anson kills Hector instead.\n\nAnson and Kerry reunite and head into the kitchen, where Anson sees his brothers condition and learns from Stef that Kerry betrayed him and brought Yannick the basil (Which Kerry confirms, and further tells him her apparent romantic interest in him was a ruse). While Anson holds his brother as he succumbs to his wounds and anaphylaxis, Kerry frees Bert, a random patron who was being kept hostage in the kitchen by Mimi. Together they head upstairs to escape through an opening for an air conditioner. When Anson suddenly runs out of the kitchen attempts to attack Kerry after Stef dies, she manages to shoot him with arrow. Thinking she is safe Kerry crawls out the opening, only for a revived Anson to appear & take a bite out of her leg; however Kerry still manages to escape. Though the fall from the opening kills Bert, Kerry lives and is riding away on a Vespa when she is hit by an ambulance, whose driver happens to be someone she completed paramedic training with. As she is loaded into the ambulance, Kerry panics and notes that Anson (who had been watching from the opening) has disappeared.\n\nSeveral months later, we see Anson consulting with his brother (who is now a pickled head impaled on a stick) before heading into the convenience store he went to in the beginning of the movie. He visits with Bethany (the clerk) and gives her a single red rose while proposing a romance between them, which Bethany agrees to. As Bethany and Anson share ice cream & flirt, the camera pulls back to reveal Kerry across the street, scarred but alive, taking photos of them. She smiles slyly into the camera before the screen cuts to black.\n\nJames Roday and Dulé Hill appear in cameos as paramedics.\n\nFilming took place in March 2013 in Los Angeles, California, with a cast including Sarah Silverman, Michael Weston, Jimmi Simpson, Sutton Foster, Lily Cole, Gabourey Sidibe, Paul Rodriguez, Molly Ephraim, Lothaire Bluteau, Gabriel Luna, and Ethan Sandler.\n\nOn April 5, 2013, after the film had already wrapped, it was ofiicially reported that James Roday was making his film directorial debut with \"Gravy\".\n\nThe distribution rights were acquired by Shout!

It consists of a large gold torc, known as the Havor Ring, along with several well-preserved bronze objects and was buried inside a Roman bronze \"situla\" in the mound surrounding a hillfort.\n\nIn 1986, the Havor Ring was stolen from the Gotland Museum. , it has not been recovered.\n\nThe hillfort in the small village of Havor in Hablingbo is located in a meadow about northeast of the main building at \"Stora Havor\" farm. The fort was built more than 2000 years ago during the Pre-Roman Iron Age. At that time it was situated on the south banks of the lake that later became Mästermyr mire. The hillfort is surrounded by a round mound or wall in diameter, about high and wide. On top of the mound, there are traces of a wooden palisade and outside it are traces of a grave. Close by are also a couple of Iron Age house foundations and in one of these seven denarii minted in 112–192 AD were found. Archaeological excavations of the area in 1961–80, revealed that the site had been continuously inhabited from the Bronze Age until the Middle Ages.\n\nThe hoard was discovered on the first day of an archaeological excavation in April 1961, by a couple of workers who were removing turf from the mound around the hillfort. The excavation was a relief work project provided by Havdhem Municipality. Two men found a vessel containing several objects and \"something that looked like gold\" under a flat stone on the inside of the mound. As there was no archaeologist present that day, they put the stone back and shoveled some dirt over it and continued to dig elsewhere. The next day archaeologists took control of the site and police had to keep press, TV crews and spectators at bay. The excavation supervisor, then archaeology student Peter Manneke, was credited with the find. Manneke phoned his boss, professor Erik Nylén, who was in Stockholm at the time and he immediately flew to Gotland. To guard the find Manneke and Nylén spent the night in sleeping bags by the hoard.\n\nThe hoard was brought to Gotland Museum where it went on public display in the Treasury (\"Skattkammaren\") for the next 25 year. At first it was displayed in a custom built iron case with armored glass and in the mid 1980s it was moved to an ordinary glass alarmed showcase.\n\nThe find consisted of a large Roman bronze vessel with a handle, a \"situla\", which held a large gold torc, four Roman wine cups resembling modern tastevins, a bronze strainer and two bronze bells. The hoard was from about 100 AD and all the objects were exceptionally well preserved. On the handle of the \"situla\" were stamps reading \"TOR, CANNIMASUIT, (P CI)PI POLYB and IPI(?)\". The two bells were tied together with leather straps into a rattle.\n\nNo official archaeological report was written on the Havor hoard or the excavation of the site at the time of the find.\n\nThe gold torc, known as the Havor Ring (\"Havorringen\") was made in the 1st century. It, along with other neck rings of this kind, were previously believed to be of western Celtic or southeast European origin, but it is now concluded that the Havor Ring could have been made in the Nordic countries. , it is the earliest known well-dated major gold ornament in the Germanic north. The torc is in diameter and weighs close to , with a gold value of about SEK 40,000–50,000 in 2006. However, the value of the neck ring as a historic art object is estimated at tens of million SEK. A copy of it was made for a display at the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm.\n\nBecause of its size, the torc is considered a unique object. It is too large to be worn by a person and it is believed to have adorned a statue of a deity and was part of a treasure belonging to a temple. Five similar but smaller torcs have been found; one in Trollhättan, one in a bog on Jutland, two near Kiev and one at Olbia by the Black Sea.\n\nThe Havor Ring is the most richly decorated and technically most complicated of the six torcs with a ring-body made from several twisted gold wires figure-8-shaped filigree ornamentation on the cones by the claps orbs. The gold wires of the ring section were twisted around a core-rod which was later removed. This made the torc very flexible when opening and closing the clasp mechanism hidden within the front orbs. The cones on the front of the ring are decorated with bullheads and half-moons made of gold sheet, surrounded by small gold grains and twisted gold wires in a filigree pattern.\n\nOn 18June 1986, the Havor Ring was stolen during visiting hours from the Gotland Museum. The circumstances of the theft have been described as \"mysterious\". On that day, the alarm in the Treasury was activated twice. After the first time, at 12pm, the antiquarian in charge of security found everything in order and the alarm was reset. At 12:45pm the alarm went off again. This time the antiquarian noticed that a latch on the lock was recessed, meaning that the showcase was unlocked, but she did not notice that the torc was gone. She locked the case and reset the alarm again. The theft was discovered at noon the next day. According to the police, the lock had been picked or opened with a key.\n\nThe police immediately sent out a nationwide alert about the missing torc and contacted Interpol. A SEK 25,000 reward was offered for information leading to the recovery of the neck ring. A young man who had been seen in the Treasury was suspected of the theft, but he was never found. In the late 1990s, the crime was investigated on the Swedish TV show \"Efterlyst\" (\"Wanted\"). Several persons have been interviewed and investigated about the crime over the years but without results. The theft is now prescribed but even if the police have no ongoing investigation about it, tips from the public are still coming into the Visby police department. Since 2015, two private investigators have been looking for the torc; a former intelligence agent and a forensic scientist, both retired. Their focus has been on a former employee at the museum – a now deceased archaeologist who was convicted of multiple antiquities thefts and sentenced to psychiatric care after having been diagnosed with kleptomania.\n\nAbout a year after the theft, a copy of the torc was made from the copy at the History Museum. , that second copy is displayed in the Gotland Museum along with the bronze objects from the hoard.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38999586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38999586", "title": "Hobbesian trap", "text": "Hobbesian trap\n\nThe Hobbesian trap (or Schelling's dilemma) is a theory that explains why preemptive strikes occur between two groups, out of bilateral fear of an imminent attack. Without outside influences this situation will lead to a fear spiral (catch-22, vicious circle, Nash equilibrium) in which fear will lead to an arms race which in turn will lead to increasing fear. The Hobbesian trap can be explained in terms of game theory. Although cooperation would be the better outcome for both sides, mutual distrust leads to the adoption of strategies that have negative outcomes for individual players and all players combined. The theory has been used to explain outbreaks of conflicts and violence, spanning from individuals to states.\n\nThe theory is most commonly associated with Thomas Hobbes and Thomas Schelling.\n\nSteven Pinker is a proponent of the theory of the Hobbesian trap and has applied the theory to many conflicts and outbreaks of violence between people, groups, tribes, societies and states. Issues of gun control have been described as a Hobbesian trap. A common example is the dilemma that both the armed burglar and the armed homeowner face when they meet each other. Neither side may want to shoot, but both are afraid of the other party shooting first so they may be inclined to fire pre-emptively, although the favorable outcome for both parties would be that nobody be shot. A similar example between two states is the Cuban Missile Crisis. Fear and mutual distrust between the actors increased the likelihood of a preemptive strike.\n\nThe Hobbesian trap can be avoided by influences that increase the trust between the two parties. In the Cuban Missile Crisis, for example, Kennedy and Khrushchev realized that they were caught in a Hobbesian trap which helped them to make concessions that reduced distrust and fear.\n\n\n\n"}

Established by the International Skating Union in the 2014–15 season, it is a group of senior-level events ranked below the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating. The events are required to include at least three disciplines (men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and ice dancing) and to take place between August 1 and December 15.\n\nThe ISU Council decided to create the series at its February 2014 meeting. Eleven competitions were selected in June 2014. The Triglav Trophy dropped out by October 10, 2014, resulting in a series composed of ten events. The Nebelhorn Trophy, Finlandia Trophy, Ondrej Nepela Memorial, and Golden Spin of Zagreb are the \"core group\".\n\nThe events are required to include at least three disciplines and to take place between August 1 and December 15. The ISU revised the event criteria in August 2014.\n\nEach skater or duo is permitted to compete in up to three ISU Challenger Series events. Their two highest scores determine the final ranking.\n\nAt the end of the series, prize money is awarded to skaters who finished in the top three in each discipline in the final ranking. In pairs and ice dancing, the partners split the prize money.\n\nIn the 2014–15, 2015–16, and 2016–17 seasons:\n"}
{"id": "2100075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100075", "title": "Information revolution", "text": "Information revolution\n\nThe term information revolution describes current economic, social and technological trends beyond the Industrial Revolution.\n\nMany competing terms have been proposed that focus on different aspects of this societal development.\nThe British polymath crystallographer J. D. Bernal introduced the term \"scientific and technical revolution\" in his 1939 book \"The Social Function of Science\" to describe the new role that science and technology are coming to play within society. He asserted that science is becoming a \"productive force\", using the Marxist Theory of Productive Forces. After some controversy, the term was taken up by authors and institutions of the then-Soviet Bloc. Their aim was to show that socialism was a safe home for the scientific and technical (\"technological\" for some authors) revolution, referred to by the acronym STR. The book \"Civilization at the Crossroads\", edited by the Czech philosopher Radovan Richta (1969), became a standard reference for this topic.\n\nDaniel Bell (1980) challenged this theory and advocated post-industrial society, which would lead to a service economy rather than socialism. Many other authors presented their views, including Zbigniew Brzezinski (1976) with his \"Technetronic Society\".\n\nThe main feature of the information revolution is the growing economic, social and technological role of information. Information-related activities did not come up with the Information Revolution. They existed, in one form or the other, in all human societies, and eventually developed into institutions, such as the Platonic Academy, Aristotle's Peripatetic school in the Lyceum, the Musaeum and the Library of Alexandria, or the schools of Babylonian astronomy. The Agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revolution came up when new informational inputs were produced by individual innovators, or by scientific and technical institutions. During the Information Revolution all these activities are experiencing continuous growth, while other information-oriented activities are emerging.\n\nInformation is the central theme of several new sciences, which emerged in the 1940s, including Shannon's (1949) \"Information Theory\" and Wiener's (1948) \"Cybernetics\". Wiener stated: \"information is information not matter or energy\". This aphorism suggests that information should be considered along with matter and energy as the third constituent part of the Universe; information is carried by matter or by energy. By the 1990s some writers believed that changes implied by the Information revolution will lead to not only a fiscal crisis for governments but also the disintegration of all \"large structures\".\n\nThe term \"information revolution\" may relate to, or contrast with, such widely used terms as Industrial Revolution and Agricultural Revolution. Note, however, that you may prefer mentalist to materialist paradigm. The following fundamental aspects of the theory of information revolution can be given:\n\n\nFrom a different perspective, Irving E. Fang (1997) identified six 'Information Revolutions': writing, printing, mass media, entertainment, the 'tool shed' (which we call 'home' now), and the information highway. In this work the term 'information revolution' is used in a narrow sense, to describe trends in communication media.\n\nPorat (1976) measured the information sector in the US using the input-output analysis; OECD has included statistics on the information sector in the economic reports of its member countries. Veneris (1984, 1990) explored the theoretical, economic and regional aspects of the informational revolution and developed a systems dynamics simulation computer model.\n\nThese works can be seen as following the path originated with the work of Fritz Machlup who in his (1962) book \"The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States\", claimed that the \"knowledge industry represented 29% of the US gross national product\", which he saw as evidence that the Information Age had begun. He defines knowledge as a commodity and attempts to measure the magnitude of the production and distribution of this commodity within a modern economy. Machlup divided information use into three classes: instrumental, intellectual, and pastime knowledge. He identified also five types of knowledge: practical knowledge; intellectual knowledge, that is, general culture and the satisfying of intellectual curiosity; pastime knowledge, that is, knowledge satisfying non-intellectual curiosity or the desire for light entertainment and emotional stimulation; spiritual or religious knowledge; unwanted knowledge, accidentally acquired and aimlessly retained.\n\nMore recent estimates have reached the following results:\n\n\n"}

In 2 out of the 47 countries was there a majority that favoured keeping troops in Afghanistan – Israel (59%) and Kenya (60%). On the other hand, in 41 of the 47 countries pluralities wanted NATO troops out of Afghanistan as soon as possible. In 32 out of 47 countries majorities wanted NATO troops out of Afghanistan as soon as possible. Majorities in 7 out of 12 NATO member countries wanted troops withdrawn as soon as possible.\n\nThe 24-nation Pew Global Attitudes survey in June 2008 again found that majorities or pluralities in 21 of 24 countries wanted NATO troops removed from Afghanistan as soon as possible. In 3 out of the 24 countries – the U.S. (50%), Australia (60%), and Britain (48%) – public opinion favoured keeping troops there until the situation stabilized. Since then, public opinion in Australia and Britain has shifted, and the majority of Australians and British now also want their troops to be brought home from Afghanistan. Of the seven NATO countries in the survey, not one showed a majority in favor of keeping NATO troops in Afghanistan – one, the U.S., came close to a majority (50%). Of the other six NATO countries, five had majorities of their population wanting NATO troops removed from Afghanistan as soon as possible.\n\nThe 25-nation Pew Global Attitudes survey in June 2009 continued to find that the war in Afghanistan was unpopular in most nations and that most publics want American and NATO troops out of Afghanistan. The 2009 global survey reported that majorities or pluralities in 18 out of 25 countries wanted NATO to remove their troops from Afghanistan as soon as possible. (Changes from 2008 included Tanzania, South Africa, and Australia having been replaced by Israel, Kenya, the Palestinian Territories, and Canada in the survey, and shifts in opinions in India and Nigeria.) In 4 out of 25 countries was there a majority that favoured keeping NATO troops in Afghanistan – the U.S. (57%), Israel (59%), Kenya (56%), and Nigeria (52%). Despite American calls for NATO allies to send more troops to Afghanistan, there was majority or plurality opposition to such action in every one of the NATO countries surveyed: Germany (63% opposition), France (62%), Poland (57%), Canada (55%), Britain (51%), Spain (50%), and Turkey (49%).\n\nIn Europe, polls in France, Germany, Britain, and other countries showed that the European public wanted their troops to be pulled out and less money spent on the war in Afghanistan.\n\nIn October 2001, a poll by CNN/Gallup/USA Today indicated that about 88% of Americans backed military action in Afghanistan, and a poll by Market Opinion Research indicated that about 65% of Britons supported having British troops involved. On the other hand, a large-scale 37-nation poll of world opinion carried out by Gallup International in late September 2001, found that majorities in most countries favoured a legal response, in the form of extradition and trial, over a military response to 9/11: In 3 of the 37 countries surveyed – the United States, Israel, and India – did majorities favour military action. In 34 out of the 37 countries surveyed, the survey found majorities that did not favour military action: in the United Kingdom (75%), France (67%), Switzerland (87%), Czech Republic (64%), Lithuania (83%), Panama (80%), Mexico (94%), etc.\n\nThis dichotomy between American and international public opinion on the military operations continues to be seen, although opposition to the war is growing in the U.S. as well. A Gallup poll conducted July 10–12, 2009 reported that the majority 61% of Americans do not think the U.S. made a mistake in sending military forces in 2001, while 36% of Americans do. 54% also thought things are going well for the U.S.. An Angus Reid poll conducted July 15–18, 2009, found that 55% of Americans support the military operation, while 35% oppose it. 49% of Americans thought their country did the right thing in sending military forces. About half, 48%, of Americans felt that they did not have a clear idea of what the war is about.\n\nOutside the United States international public opinion has been largely opposed to the war. In a 47-nation June 2007 survey of global public opinion, the Pew Global Attitudes Project found considerable opposition to NATO operations. In 4 out of the 47 countries surveyed was there a majority that favoured keeping troops: the U.S. (50%), Israel (59%), Ghana (50%), and Kenya (60%). In 41 of the 47 countries, pluralities want NATO troops out as soon as possible. In 32 out of 47 countries, majorities want NATO troops out as soon as possible. Majorities in 7 out of 12 NATO member countries say troops should be withdrawn as soon as possible.\n\nThe 24-nation Pew Global Attitudes survey in June 2008 similarly found that majorities or pluralities in 21 of 24 countries want NATO to remove their troops as soon as possible. In 3 out of the 24 countries – the U.S. (50%), Australia (60%), and Britain (48%) – did public opinion lean more toward keeping troops there until the situation has stabilized. Since that poll, views in Britain and Australia have also diverged from public opinion in the United States, and majorities in both Britain and Australia now want their troops to be brought back home from the war. Of the seven NATO countries included in the survey, none showed a majority in favor of keeping NATO troops until the situation stabilised – only the United States came close to a majority (50%). Of the other six NATO countries, five had majorities of their population wanting NATO troops to be removed as soon as possible: Spain (56%), France (54%), Germany (54%), Poland (65%), and Turkey (72%).\n\nThe 25-nation Pew Global Attitudes survey in June 2009 continued to find the war to be unpopular in most nations, with most publics wanting American and NATO troops out as soon as possible. The 2009 global survey reported that majorities or pluralities in 18 out of 25 countries want NATO to remove their troops from Afghanistan as soon as possible. (Changes from the 2008 survey included Tanzania, South Africa, and Australia having been replaced by Israel, Kenya, the Palestinian Territories, and Canada in the survey, as well as shifts in opinions in India and Nigeria.) In 4 out of 25 countries was there a majority that favoured keeping NATO troops in Afghanistan – the U.S. (57%), Israel (59%), Kenya (56%), and Nigeria (52%). In 1 of the 8 NATO countries included in the survey – the U.S. – was there a majority in favour of keeping NATO troops until the situation stabilised. Despite repeated American calls for NATO allies to send more troops to Afghanistan, there was majority or plurality opposition to such action in all seven of the other NATO countries surveyed: Germany (63% disapprove), France (62%), Poland (57%), Canada (55%), Britain (51%), Spain (50%), and Turkey (49%).\n\nThe 22-nation Pew Global Attitudes survey released in June 2010 again continued to find the war unpopular in most nations. The poll reported that majorities or pluralities in 16 of 22 countries want the military forces to be withdrawn \"as soon as possible\". One country out of the 22 was there a majority that supported keeping troops until the situation stabilizes (57% in Kenya).\n\nWhile support for the war continues to be strongest in the U.S. and Israel, recent polls have also shown growing opposition in the U.S., including majority opposition.\n\nA Washington Post – ABC poll conducted July 15–18, 2009 found that just half of Americans, 51%, think the war is worth fighting, while nearly half, 45%, think the war is not worth fighting – a statistical tie within the poll's ±3 point margin of error. The American public is also closely divided on whether the United States is making significant progress toward winning the war, with 46% thinking so and 42% not.\n\nAn Associated Press – GfK poll conducted July 16–20, 2009 found that the majority 53% of Americans oppose the war, while 44% support it. It furthermore found that the plurality of Americans, 34%, strongly opposed the war, while 20% strongly favored it. (Another 19% somewhat opposed the war, 20% somewhat favored it, and 3% did not know or declined to answer.)\n\nA CNN – Opinion Research poll conducted July 31 – August 3, 2009 also found that most Americans now oppose the war. In a new low in American public support for the war, 54% of Americans said they opposed the war, while 41% supported it.\n\nFollowing the August 20, 2009 election in Afghanistan that was characterized by widespread lack of security and massive fraud, and capping off the two deadliest months for U.S. troops in the 8-year war, the CNN-Opinion Research poll conducted August 28–31, 2009 registered the highest level of opposition to the war the poll has yet seen. A majority 57% of Americans now oppose the war in Afghanistan, while 42% still support it.\n\nA Washington Post – ABC News poll conducted September 10–12, 2009 reported that:\n\nThe poll found that the plurality 42% of Americans now want a reduction of the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, and that 26% of Americans think more troops should be sent to Afghanistan.\n\nThe CNN – Opinion Research poll conducted September 11–13, 2009, found that American opposition to the war reached a new all-time high, while American support for the war fell to a new all-time low. The majority 58% of Americans now oppose the war, while 39% support it.\n\nKeating Holland, CNN's polling director, observed that:\n\nHe noted that support for the war in Iraq had first dropped to 39 percent in June 2005 then generally remained in the low to mid-30s since.\n\nThe Associated Press – GfK poll conducted October 1–5, 2009 found the majority 57% of Americans oppose the war, up 4% from July, while 40% favor the war, down 4% from July.\n\nThe CNN / Opinion Research poll conducted October 30 – November 1, 2009 found that the majority 58% of Americans oppose the war, while 40% support it. The majority 56% of Americans also oppose sending more U.S. troops, while 42% favor doing so.\n\nThe Pew Research poll conducted October 28 – November 8, 2009 found that the majority 59% of Americans oppose sending more U.S. troops: The plurality 40% of Americans want the number of U.S. troops to be reduced, and 19% want the number of troops to remain unchanged. 32% support sending more U.S. troops.\n\nThe Gallup poll conducted November 5–8, 2009 found that the majority 51% of Americans oppose sending more U.S. troops: The plurality 44% of Americans want the number of U.S. troops to be reduced, and 7% want the number to be kept unchanged.\n\nThe Associated Press – GfK poll conducted November 5–9, 2009 again found that the majority 57% of Americans oppose the war, while 39% favor it.\n\nThe ABC News / Washington Post poll conducted November 12–15, 2009 found that the majority 52% of Americans now say the war is not worth fighting, a new high in opposition for the poll question first asked in 2007, and that 44% say it is worth fighting, a new low in support.

One-third, 33%, of Americans think large numbers of U.S. troops should be withdrawn in less than a year, another 23% think that should be done within one or two years, and 2% want an immediate withdrawal. 26% of Americans think U.S. troops should remain for as long as it takes, 7% think they should stay another two to five years, and 2% think they should stay for another five to ten years.\n\nThe CNN / Opinion Research poll conducted August 6–10, 2010 showed the American public's opposition to the war at an all-time high.

Among Democrats 36% think the war has been worth fighting.\n\nIn the CNN / Opinion Research poll conducted December 17–19, 2010, the three-quarters majority of Democratic voters oppose the war, as do more than six in ten independent voters, while, on the other hand, 52% of Republicans, and 52% of Tea Party supporters, supported continuation of the war.\n\nThe Washington Post / ABC News poll conducted March 10–13, 2011 reported that 19% of Democratic voters think the war is worth fighting – compared to half of Republican supporters, the chief constituency supporting the war. The majority two-thirds of independent voters think the war is not worth fighting, while about one-in-four think it is. 80% of independent voters want Barack Obama to withdraw a \"substantial number\" of troops from Afghanistan \"this summer\".\n\nIn the USA Today / Gallup poll conducted May 5–8, 2011, a week following the killing of Osama bin Laden, Democratic and independent voters, by a 2-to-1 margin, believe the U.S. has finished its work and should now bring its troops home.

The majority 71% of conservative voters, including over two-thirds of Tea Party supporters, are worried that the war's cost to American taxpayers – $120 billion spent on the war in 2010 – will make it more difficult to reduce the U.S. deficit next year and balance the U.S. federal budget in the next decade. The poll for the Afghanistan Study Group was conducted January 4–10, 2011.\n\nA USA Today / Gallup poll conducted January 14–16, 2011 also reported that, behind an 86% of Democrats and 72% of independents, there was now also 61% of self-identified conservatives calling for an accelerated withdrawal of U.S. troops.\n\nIn the Gallup poll conducted June 25–26, 2011, 50% of Republican voters generally favor the announced withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by 2014, while 43% opposed it.\n\nIn the CBS News / New York Times poll conducted June 24–28, 2011, 67% of Republican voters approve of the plan to withdraw all U.S. troops by the end of summer 2012, and 75% of Republican voters want at least one-third of U.S. troops withdrawn by the end of summer 2012: the plurality 41% of Republican voters want more than one-third of U.S. troops withdrawn in this timeframe, 34% want about a third, while 18% thought it should be less than one-third.\n\nIn 2008, not one of the six NATO allies in the Pew Global Attitudes survey had majority support for keeping troops in Afghanistan, and five of the six had majorities wanting withdrawal as soon as possible. In 2009, not one of the seven NATO allies in the Pew Global Attitudes survey had majority support for continuing to keep military forces there, but all seven of the NATO allies in the survey had majority or strong plurality opposition to sending more troops.\n\nThe June 2009 \"Transatlantic Trends\" survey of 13 NATO countries, also from an American policy think tank, the German Marshall Fund of the United States, further underlined the publics' opposition to the war in NATO countries involved with the U.S. in Afghanistan.\n\nThe majorities of the populations of all 12 of the NATO nations surveyed in Europe and Turkey want their military forces in Afghanistan to be reduced or completely withdrawn – United Kingdom (60%), France (51%), Germany (57%), Italy (55%), Netherlands (50%), Poland (68%), Portugal (52%), Spain (54%), Slovakia (61%), Bulgaria (72%), Romania (61%), Turkey (50%).\n\nThe majority 55% of West Europeans and the majority 69% of East Europeans want to reduce or remove their troops from Afghanistan, with complete troop removal called for by 51% of Poles, 50% of Bulgarians, 48% of Romanians, 41% of Britons, and 41% of Germans.\n\nDespite pressure from the Obama administration to increase their troop levels in Afghanistan, the public is strongly opposed in all 12 of the NATO ally countries surveyed. 77% of people, in the 12 NATO countries surveyed in the Europe Union and Turkey oppose sending more troops to Afghanistan. Fewer than 1 in 5 people, 19%, in the 12 NATO countries supported sending more troops.\n\"(Source: German Marshall Fund of the United States – Transatlantic Trends June 2009, 2010, and 2011 surveys)\"\n\nThe poll of the NATO countries, conducted in June 2009, about 2 months before the Afghan election, also reported that 56% of Americans were optimistic about stabilizing the situation in Afghanistan, whereas the majority 62% of people in the 12 NATO countries in Europe and Turkey were not.\n\nIn the 2009 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey, none of the seven NATO allies surveyed had majority support for keeping NATO troops in Afghanistan. Despite repeated American calls for their NATO allies to send more troops to Afghanistan, there was majority or plurality opposition to such action in all seven of the NATO ally countries surveyed: Germany (63% disapprove), France (62%), Poland (57%), Canada (55%), Britain (51%), Spain (50%), and Turkey (49%).\n\nIn 2010, none of the six NATO allies in the Pew Global Attitudes survey had majority support for keeping troops in Afghanistan. The survey found instead that the majorities and pluralities of the public in 5 out of 6 NATO member countries want the NATO military forces to be removed from Afghanistan \"as soon as possible\". A 67% majority in Turkey, 58% majority in Germany, 52% majority in France, 49% plurality in Spain, 44% plurality in Poland, and 45% in the United Kingdom all want the NATO military forces to be removed from Afghanistan \"as soon as possible\".\n\nThe Transatlantic Trends June 2010 study by the German Marshall Fund of the United States found that pluralities all of the 12 NATO ally countries surveyed, and majorities in 11 out of 12 of them, want to withdraw all or some of their troops from Afghanistan.\n\nFor the 12 European NATO countries surveyed as a whole, 70% think their country should begin to withdraw troops immediately (36%) or in 2011 if conditions permit (36%). 23% think their troops should stay as long as it takes to \"stabilize\" Afghanistan. The majority 62% of the European NATO populations surveyed want a complete withdrawal of all of their troops (the 43% plurality) or a reduction of troops (19%). 28% would keep the troop numbers at their current levels. 6% would agree to send more troops to Afghanistan.\n\nThe Transatlantic Trends June 2011 study by the German Marshall Fund of the United States found that majorities in the United States (66%) and in all 11 European NATO member countries surveyed – the United Kingdom (69%), Germany (70%), France (64%), Italy (65%), Poland (73%), Portugal (58%), Spain (57%), Netherlands (55%), Romania (67%), Bulgaria (63%), and Slovakia (64%) – want all or some troops withdrawn from Afghanistan. For all 11 European NATO countries taken as a whole, the majority 66% of Europeans in the NATO countries surveyed want all or some of their troops withdrawn from Afghanistan: the plurality 44% want all of their troops to be withdrawn from Afghanistan, another 22% want some of their troops to be withdrawn to reduce the number there. Less than one in three, 29%, support maintaining the current number of troops in Afghanistan, and 3% would support sending yet more troops.\n\nIn December 2010, the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, acknowledged the opposition of the public in almost all countries:\n\nMarek Obrtel, former Lieutenant Colonel in Field Hospital with Czech Republic army, returned his medals which he received during his posting in Afghanistan War for NATO operations. He criticized the War on Terror as describing the mission as \"deeply ashamed that I served a criminal organization such as NATO, led by the USA and its perverse interests around the world.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2199811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2199811", "title": "It girl", "text": "It girl\n\nAn it girl is an attractive young woman, generally a celebrity, who is perceived to have both sex appeal and a personality that is especially engaging.\n\nThe expression \"it girl\" originated in British upper-class society around the turn of the 20th century. It reached global attention in 1927, with the popularity of the Paramount Studios film \"It\", starring Clara Bow. In the earlier usage, a woman was especially perceived as an \"it girl\" if she had achieved a high level of popularity without flaunting her sexuality. Today the term is used more to apply simply to fame and beauty.\n\nAn early literary usage of \"it\" in this sense may be traced to a 1904 short story by Rudyard Kipling: \"It isn’t beauty, so to speak, nor good talk necessarily. It’s just ‘It’.\"\nElinor Glyn, the notorious British novelist who wrote the book titled \"It\" and the subsequent screenplay, lectured \nGlyn first rose to fame as the author of the scandalous 1907 bestseller \"Three Weeks\". She is usually credited with the invention of the ‘It Girl’ concept: although the slang predates her book and film, she is definitely responsible for the impact the term had on the culture of the 1920s. \nBow later said she wasn’t sure what “It” meant, although she identified Lana Turner and later Marilyn Monroe as “It Girls”, and Robert Mitchum as an “It Man”.\n\nThe fashion component of the \"It Girl\", originated with the celebrated couturier Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, known professionally as “Lucile”, the name under which she directed exclusive salons in London, Paris and New York; she was Elinor Glyn’s elder sister. As Lucile, Lucy Duff-Gordon was the first designer to present her collections on a stage complete with the theatrical accoutrements of lights and music, inspiring the modern runway or catwalk show, and she was famous for making sexuality an aspect of fashion through her provocative lingerie and lingerie-inspired clothes. Lucile also specialised in dressing trendsetting stage and film performers, ranging from the stars of the \"Ziegfeld Follies\" on Broadway to silent screen icons such as Mary Pickford and Irene Castle.\n\nAs early as 1917, Lucile herself used the term \"It\" in relation to style in her fashion column for \"Harper's Bazaar\": \"... I saw a very ladylike and well-bred friend of mine in her newest Parisian frock ... she felt she was 'it' and perfectly happy.\"\n\nThe Paramount Studios' film was planned as a special showcase for its popular star Clara Bow, and her spectacular performance introduced the term ‘It’ to the cultural lexicon.\nThe film plays with the notion that \"It\" is a quality which eschews definitions and categories; consequently, the girl portrayed by Bow is an amalgam of an ingenue and a femme fatale, with a touch of Madonna's latter day \"Material Girl\" incarnation. By contrast, Bow's rival in the script is equally young and comely (and rich and well-bred to boot), yet she doesn't have \"It\".\n\nSince the 1990s, \"It Girl\" or \"It-Girl\" has been used slightly differently, referring to a wealthy, normally unemployed, young woman who is pictured in tabloids going to many parties often in the company of other celebrities, receiving media coverage in spite of no real personal achievements or TV hosting / presenting. The writer William Donaldson observed that, having initially been coined in the 1920s, the term was applied in the 1990s to describe \"a young woman of noticeable 'sex appeal' who occupied herself by shoe shopping and party-going\".\n\nThe prominence of an \"It Girl\" is often temporary; some of the rising It Girls will either become fully-fledged celebrities, commonly initially via engineering appearances on reality TV shows or series; lacking such an accelerant, their popularity will normally fade. Reflection on the celebrity-focused and celebrity-promoting nature of news media – particularly tabloid newspapers – may be helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Szwed is the author of many books on jazz and American music, including studies of Sun Ra, Miles Davis, Jelly Roll Morton, Alan Lomax and Billie Holiday.\nSzwed received a B.S. in business and economics from Marietta College in 1958. He also studied trombone and music theory and played professionally for twelve years; as an undergraduate, he worked in a steel mill and performed at roadhouses, country clubs, college dances and speakeasies in Ohio and West Virginia. Thereafter, he enrolled at Ohio State University, where he earned a second bachelor's degree in communications in 1959, an M.A. in communications in 1960 and a Ph.D. in sociology and anthropology in 1965. His graduate school adviser was anthropology pioneer Erika Bourguignon, who encouraged him to bring to his work what he already knew and experienced. His work as an anthropologist and folklorist includes field studies in Newfoundland, the Georgia Sea Islands, and Trinidad.\n\nFrom 1982 to 2008, Szwed was John M. Musser Professor of Anthropology, African American Studies and Film Studies at Yale University. Szwed was appointed term Professor of Music and Jazz Studies at Columbia University in 2008, a position he held through 2014. From 2011 to 2014, he was Director of the Center for Jazz Studies at Columbia. He has also taught at New York University and the University of Pennsylvania, where he was Director of the Center for Urban Ethnography and Chair of the Department of Folklore.

Szwed argues that Holiday's autobiography, \"Lady Sings the Blues\", is a generally accurate account of Holiday's life, and that Holiday's co-writer, William Dufty, was forced to water down or suppress material by the threat of legal action. \"The New Yorker\" reviewer Richard Brody writes: \"In particular, Szwed traces the stories of two important relationships that are missing from the book—with Charles Laughton, in the nineteen-thirties, and with Tallulah Bankhead, in the late nineteen-forties—and of one relationship that’s sharply diminished in the book, her affair with Orson Welles around the time of \"Citizen Kane\".\"\n\n\n"}

The sequel to the 2001 film \"Legally Blonde\", the film stars Reese Witherspoon alongside an ensemble cast featuring Sally Field, Regina King, Jennifer Coolidge, Bruce McGill, Dana Ivey, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Bob Newhart, and Luke Wilson, with Coolidge and Wilson reprising their roles from the first film.\n\nAlthough the story is set in Washington, D.C., the film was shot in the offices at Vivint Smart Home Arena (then the Delta Center), the Utah State Capitol in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. The supposed \"aerial views\" on Washington buildings were scale models built by the crew.\n\nThe film opened on July 2, 2003, to generally negative reviews from critics. However, it was a box office success, grossing $90 million in North America and $125 million worldwide.\n\nElle Woods wants her Chihuahua, Bruiser, to reunite with his mother, because she would like Bruiser's mom to attend her wedding to Emmett. Elle hires a detective to find Bruiser's mother, only to discover that the owner of her dog's mother is C'est Magnifique, a cosmetics company that uses Bruiser's mother for \"testing\". She finds out that her law firm represents the C'est Magnifique Corporation and when she urges the firm to drop them as a client, she's fired.\n\nElle decides to leave Boston, where she and Bruiser have settled with her fiancé Emmett, and go to Washington, D.C., to work on Bruiser's Bill. Elle is upset that her dog's mother is in a make-up testing laboratory, and decides to take it upon herself to be the \"voice for those who can't speak\" and to outlaw animal testing.\n\nWhile working for Congresswoman Victoria Rudd, Elle is met with skepticism and other barriers common to Washington politics. Rudd's member of staff, Timothy, sarcastically calls her \"Capitol Barbie\". (There has even been a Barbie doll based on Elle Woods.) After a variety of ups and downs including a failed attempt to improve her work environment by having her co-workers write compliments about one another and place them in the \"snap cup\", Elle starts to lose her faith in Washington politics.\n\nElle discovers that Bruiser is actually gay, after she is paged by \"The Paws That Refreshes: A Doggy Day Spa\". Bruiser has been affectionate with Leslie, a Rottweiller owned by Congressman Stan Marks, the Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce which has jurisdiction over Bruiser's Bill. Elle also finds that Congresswoman Libby Hauser, the Ranking Member of the same committee, was a member of Elle's sorority Delta Nu. As a result, both Marks and Hauser warm to Elle and eventually come to support Bruiser's Bill.\n\nElle also discovers that Congresswoman Rudd has actually been working against her. Rudd has been doing so in an effort to satisfy the interests of a major campaign donor named \"Bob\" (who is never seen, but with whom Rudd has several telephone conversations). However, Rudd is eventually blackmailed into supporting Elle's petition, because Rudd's Chief of Staff, Grace Rossiter, eavesdrops on a recorded conversation during which Rudd admits to Elle that she has been working against Bruiser's Bill in order to help Rudd's sponsors who want to continue with tests on animals. As Grace is appalled that Rudd lied to Elle and blamed it on her, Grace and Elle eventually reach a place of mutual respect, especially after Grace admits she came to Washington D.C. with an enthusiasm not unlike Elle's, but later lost that idealism when she discovered how dirty politics could really be.\n\nWith the help of her friends, Elle's discharge petition is successful, and Bruiser's Bill is brought to the floor of the House. Bruiser's mother and the rest of the dogs are released by C'est Magnifique Corporation. Elle and Emmett get married in a park in D.C., albeit not at Fenway Park as they had planned, but standing on the home plate which has been delivered to D.C. by the UPS Guy.\n\nIn the final scene, Emmett asks Elle whether they want to live in Beverly Hills, Washington D.C., or Boston. As Elle has many legal and political job offers after the successful discharge hearing, she responds, \"Oh, I think I know just the place\", and winks as they drive by the White House.\n\n\nAlthough Witherspoon's performance was highly praised, the film overall received mostly negative reviews, and came in at number 21 on \"Entertainment Weekly\"s \"Top 25 Worst Sequels Ever Made\" (2006). It currently holds 38% on Rotten Tomatoes, the critical consensus being that \"this blonde joke is less funny the second time around\".\n\nThe film hit theaters on the Wednesday before the Fourth of July in 2003 and grossed nearly $40 million by Monday. However, the following weekend the film could only boast sales half of that and the film quickly left theaters in the coming weeks. Grossing about $90 million in the U.S., the film was a success for the studio, though many expected it to perform just as well as Witherspoon's last big film, \"Sweet Home Alabama\".\n\nA soundtrack for the film was released on July 1, 2003, by Curb Records. \"We Can\" was released as a single for the soundtrack by American country music recording artist LeAnn Rimes on October 28, 2003, by Curb Records.\n\n"}

{"id": "201330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201330", "title": "Mother goddess", "text": "Mother goddess\n\nA mother goddess is a goddess who represents, or is a personification of nature, motherhood, fertility, creation, destruction or who embodies the bounty of the Earth. When equated with the Earth or the natural world, such goddesses are sometimes referred to as Mother Earth or as the Earth Mother.\n\nThere is difference of opinion between the academic and the popular conception of the term. The popular view is mainly driven by the Goddess movement and reads that primitive societies initially were matriarchal, worshipping a sovereign, nurturing, motherly earth goddess. This was based upon the nineteenth-century ideas of unilineal evolution of Johann Jakob Bachofen. According to the academic view, however, both Bachofen and the modern Goddess theories are a projection of contemporary world views on ancient myths, rather than attempting to understand the \"mentalité\" of that time. Often this is accompanied by a desire for a lost civilization from a bygone era that would have been just, peaceful and wise. However, it is highly unlikely that such a civilization ever existed.\n\nFor a long time, feminist authors advocated that these peaceful, matriarchal agrarian societies were exterminated or subjugated by nomadic, patriarchal warrior tribes. An important contribution to this was that of archaeologist Marija Gimbutas. Her work in this field is now however largely rejected. Also with feminist archaeologists this vision is nowadays considered highly controversial.\n\nSince the sixties of the twentieth century, especially in popular culture, the alleged worship of the mother goddess and the social position that women in prehistoric societies supposedly assumed, were linked. This made the debate a political one. According to the goddess movement, the current male-dominated society should return to the egalitarian matriarchy of earlier times. That this form of society ever existed was supposedly supported by many figurines that were found.\nIn academic circles, this prehistoric matriarchy is considered unlikely. Firstly, worshiping a mother goddess does not necessarily mean that women ruled society. In addition, the figurines can also portray ordinary women or goddesses, and it is unclear whether there really ever was a mother goddess.\n\nBetween 1961 and 1965 James Mellaart led a series of excavations at Çatalhöyük, north of the Taurus Mountains in a fertile agricultural region of South-Anatolia. Striking were the many statues found here, which Mellaart suggested represented a Great goddess, who headed the pantheon of an essentially matriarchal culture. A seated female figure, flanked by what Mellaart describes as lionesses, was found in a grain-bin; she may have intended to protect the harvest and grain. He considered the sites as shrines, with especially the Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük capturing the imagination. There was also a large number of sexless figurines, which Mellaart regarded as typical for a society dominated by women: \"emphasis on sex in art is invariably connected with male impulse and desire\". The idea that there could have been a matriarchy and a cult of the mother goddess was supported by archaeologist Marija Gimbutas. This gave rise to a modern cult of the Mother Goddess with annual pilgrimages being organized at Çatalhöyük.\n\nSince 1993, excavations were resumed, now headed by Ian Hodder with Lynn Meskell as head of the \"Stanford Figurines Project\" that examined the figurines of Çatalhöyük. This team came to different conclusions than Gimbutas and Mellaart. Only a few of the figurines were identified as female and these figurines were found not so much in sacred spaces, but seemed to have been discarded randomly, sometimes in garbage heaps. This rendered a cult of the mother goddess in this location as unlikely.\n\nIn Hinduism, Durga represents the feminine aspect and the \"shakti\" (energy/power) of the One God (The \"Brahman\"), as well as the empowering and protective nature of motherhood. From her forehead sprang Kali, who defeated Durga's enemy, Shumbh. Kali (the feminine form of Kaala\" i.e. \"time\") is the primordial energy as power of Time, literally, the \"creator or doer of time\"—her first manifestation. After time, she manifests as \"space\", as Tara, from which point further creation of the material universe progresses. The divine Mother, Devi Adi parashakti, manifests herself in various forms, representing the universal creative force. She becomes Mother Nature (Mula Prakriti), who gives birth to all life forms as plants, animals, and such from Herself, and she sustains and nourishes them through her body, that is the earth with its animal life, vegetation, and minerals. Ultimately she re-absorbs all life forms back into herself, or \"devours\" them to sustain herself as the power of death feeding on life to produce new life. She also gives rise to Maya (the illusory world) and to prakriti, the force that galvanizes the divine ground of existence into self-projection as the cosmos. The Earth itself is manifested by Adi parashakti. Hindu worship of the divine Mother can be traced back to pre-vedic, prehistoric India.\n\nThe form of Hinduism known as Shaktism is strongly associated with Samkhya, and Tantra Hindu philosophies and ultimately, is monist. The primordial feminine creative-preservative-destructive energy, Shakti, is considered to be the motive force behind all action and existence in the phenomenal cosmos. The cosmos itself is purusha, the unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality that is the Divine Ground of all being, the \"world soul\". This masculine potential is actualized by feminine dynamism, embodied in multitudinous goddesses who are ultimately all manifestations of the One Great Mother. Mother Maya or Shakti, herself, can free the individual from demons of ego, ignorance, and desire that bind the soul in maya (illusion). Practitioners of the Tantric tradition focus on Shakti to free themselves from the cycle of karma.\n\nSome members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) believe in, but do not worship, a Heavenly Mother, or heavenly mothers, the wife and female counterpart of the Heavenly Father. This belief is not emphasized, however, and typically, adherents pray to the \"Father in Heaven\".\n\nIn Theosophy, the Earth goddess is called the \"Planetary Logos of Earth\".\n\nThe Mother Goddess, or Great Goddess, is a composite of various feminine deities from past and present world cultures, worshiped by modern Wicca and others broadly known as Neopagans. She is considered sometimes identified as a Triple Goddess, who takes the form of Maiden, Mother, and Crone archetypes. She is described as Mother Earth, Mother Nature, or the Creatress of all life. She is associated with the full moon and stars, the Earth, and the sea. In Wicca, the Earth Goddess is sometimes called Gaia. The name of the mother goddess varies depending on the Wiccan tradition.\n\nCarl Gustav Jung suggested that the archetypal mother was a part of the collective unconscious of all humans, and various Jungian students, e.g. Erich Neumann and Ernst Whitmont, have argued that such mother imagery underpins many mythologies, and precedes the image of the paternal \"father\", in such religious systems. Such speculations help explain the universality of such mother goddess imagery around the world.\n\nThe Upper Paleolithic Venus figurines have been sometimes explained as depictions of an Earth Goddess similar to Gaia.\n"}
{"id": "15465907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15465907", "title": "Nakshi kantha", "text": "Nakshi kantha\n\nNakshi kantha, a type of embroidered quilt, is a centuries-old Bengali art tradition of the Bengal Region, notable in Bangladesh and Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura. The basic material used is thread and old cloth. Nakshi kanthas are made throughout Bangladesh, but the greater Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Faridpur and Jessore areas are most famous for this craft.\n\nThe colourful patterns and designs that are embroidered resulted in the name \"Nakshi Kantha\", which was derived from the Bengali word \"naksha\", which refers to artistic patterns. The early kanthas had a white background accented with red, blue and black embroidery; later yellow, green, pink and other colours were also included. The running stitch called \"kantha stitch\" is the main stitch used for the purpose. Traditionally, kantha was produced for the use of the family. Today, after the revival of the nakshi kantha, they are produced commercially.\nThe word \"kantha\" has no discernible etymological root. The exact time of origin of the word kantha is not accurately known but it probably had a precursor in \"kheta\" (khet Bengali means \"field\"). According to Niaz Zaman, the word \"kantha\" originated from the Sanskrit word \"kontha\", which means rags, as kantha is made of rags.\n\nLike any other folk art, kantha making is influenced by factors such as materials available, daily needs, climate, geography, and economic factors. Probably the earliest form of kantha was the patchwork kantha, and the kanthas of the decorative appliqué type evolved from this.\n\nThe earliest mention of Bengal Kantha is found in the book \"Sri Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita\" by Krishnadas Kaviraj, which was written some five hundred years ago. The famous Bengali poet Jasimuddin also had a very famous poem 'Nakshi Kanthar Math' on Nakshi Kantha \n\nTraditionally old sarees, lungis and dhotis were used to make kanthas. Kantha making was not a full-time job. Women in almost every household were expert in the art. Rural women worked at leisure time or during the lazy days of the rainy season, so taking months or even years to finish a kantha was normal. At least five to seven sarees were needed to make a standard-size kantha. Today the old materials are replaced by new cotton cloths. Traditionally the thread was collected from the old sarees. That is rarely done today.\n\nWhen a kantha is being made, first the sarees are joined together to attain the required size, and then layers are spread out on the ground. The cloths are then smoothed, and no folds or creases are left in between. During the process, the cloth is kept flat on the ground with weights on the edges. Then the four edges are stitched and two or three rows of large running stitches are done to keep the kantha together. At this stage, the kantha can be folded and stitched at leisure time.\n\nOriginally, designs and motifs were not drawn on the cloth. The design was first outlined with needle and thread, followed by focal points, and then the filling motifs were done. In a kantha with a predominant central motif the centre was done first, followed by corner designs and the other details. In some types of kanthas (carpet, lik and sujni, etc.) wooden blocks were used to print the outline. The blocks are replaced today by patterns drawn in tracing papers.\n\nModern Kantha-stitch craft industry involves a very complex multi-staged production model.\n\nThe following is how kanthas are categorized, according to the stitch type:\n\nThe running stitch kantha is truly the indigenous kantha. They are subdivided into Nakshi (figured) and par tola (patterned). Nakshi (figured) kanthas are further divided into motif or scenic kanthas.\n\nThe name was derived from Persian word \"lehr\", which means wave. This type of kantha is particularly popular in Rajshahi. These kanthas are further divided into soja (straight or simple), Kautar khupi (pigeon coop or triangle), borfi or diamond (charchala, atchala or barachala).\n\nThe Lik or Anarasi (pine apple) type of kantha is found in the Chapainawabganj and Jessore areas. The variations are lik tan, lik tile, lik jhumka, and lik lohori.\n\nThis type of kantha was introduced by the English during the British Rule in India. The stitch employed in these kanthas is the cross-stitch.\n\nThis type of kantha is found only in Rajshahi area. The popular motif used is the undulating floral and vine motif.\n\nThe earliest and most basic stitch found in kanthas is the \"running stitch\". The predominant form of this stitch is called the \"phor\" or kantha stitch. The other forms of stitches used are the Chatai or \"pattern darning\", Kaitya or \"bending stitch\", \"weave running stitch\", \"darning stitch\", \"Jessore stitch\" (a variation of darning stitch), \"threaded running stitch\", Lik phor or anarasi or ghar hasia \"(Holbein) stitches\". The stitches used in modern-day kantha are the \"Kasmiri stitch\" and the \"arrowhead stitch\". Stitches like the \"herringbone stitch\", \"satin stitch\", \"backstitch\" and \"cross-stitch\" are occasionally used.\n\nKanthas generally denote quilts used as wrappers; however, all articles made by quilting old cloth may also be referred to by the same generic name. However, depending on the size and purpose, kanthas may be divided into various articles, each with its specific names. The various types of kantha are as follows:\n\nMotifs of the nakshi kantha are deeply influenced by religious belief and culture. Even though no specific strict symmetry is followed, a finely embroidered naksi kantha will always have a focal point. Most kanthas will have a lotus as focal point, and around the lotus there are often undulating vines or floral motifs, or a shari border motif. The motifs may include images of flower and leaves, birds and fish, animals, kithen forms even toilet articles.\n\nWhile most kantas have some initial pattern, no two naksi kantas are same. While traditional motifs are repeated, the individual touch is used in the variety of stitches, colours and shapes. The notable motifs found in naksi kantha are as follows:\n\nThe lotus motif is the most common motif found in kanthas. This motif is associated with Hindu iconography and thus is also very popular in the kantha. The lotus is the divine seat. It is also symbolic of cosmic harmony and essential womanhood. The lotus is also the symbol of eternal order and of the union of earth, water and, sky. It represents the life-giving power of water, and is also associated with the sun for the opening and closing of the petals. It is also the symbol of the recreating power of life. With the drying up of water, the lotus dies and with the rain it springs to life again. The lotus is associated with purity and the goddess Laksmi, the goddess of good fortune and abundance. There are various forms of lotus motifs, from the eight-petaled \"astadal padma\" to the hundred petaled \"satadal\". In the older kanthas, the central motif is almost always a fully bloomed lotus seen from above.\n\nThe solar motif is closely associated with the lotus motif. Often, the lotus and the solar motifs are found together at the centre of a nakshi kantha. The solar motif symbolizes the life giving power of the sun. The sun is associated with the fire which plays a significant part in Hindu rites, both religious and matrimonial.\n\nThe moon motif has a religious influence, and is popular amongst the Muslims. Mostly it is in the form of a crescent moon accompanied by a star. This motif is particularly found in \"jainamaz\" kanthas.\n\nThe wheel is a common symbol in Indian art, both Hindu and Buddhist. It is the symbol of order. The wheel also represents the world. The wheel is a popular motif in kanthas even when the maker has forgotten the significance of the symbol. The motif is relatively easy to make with \"chatai phor.\"\n\nSu asti in Sanskrit means it is well. As a motif in Indian art, it dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization. It is symbol of good fortune. It is also known as \"muchri\" or \"golok dhanda.\" With the passage of time, the design is more curvilinear than the four armed swastika of the Mohenjodaro seal. The symbolic design has significant influence in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.\n\nThe influence of this motif in Indian art and culture (as with kantha) may be traced back to the Indus Valley Civilization. \"It is likely that the Indus people conceived the pipal as the Tree of Life...with the devata inside embodying the power of fecundity.\" During the Buddhist times, the cult of the tree continued. Pipal is sacred to the Buddha because he received enlightenment under its shade. It reflects the fecundity of nature and is very popular in Bengal. Vines and creepers play an important role in kanthas and they contain the same symbolisation as that of tree of life. A popular motif in Rajshahi lohori is the betel leaf.\n\nThis is a latter-day motif, dating from Mughal times. The kalka or paisley motif originated in Persia and Kashmir and has become an integral image of the subcontinental decorative motif. It can be compared with a stylized leaf, mango or flame. The kalka is an attractive motif and number of varieties are experimented. Similar motifs can be found in traditional kashmiri shawls.\n\n\nMost nakshi kanthas have some kind of border. Either a sari border is stitched on or a border pattern is embroidered around the kantha. The common border found in kanthas are as follows: \n\n\n\nDespite being a Bangladeshi traditional art, the Indian state of West Bengal applied for the Geographical Indication for Nakshi kantha in 2008. Due to absence of proper law on Geographical Indication in Bangladesh that time (which was later adopted), Bangladesh couldn't counter apply for the GI. The registry office had no option but to hand-over the Geographical Indication to West Bengal in 2008.\n\nBangladesh authority however later passed the \"Bangladesh Geographical Indication (Registration and Protection) Act, 2013\" in parliament and with other necessary preparations now waiting for the next re-applying time cycle to claim the Geographical Indication for Nakshi kantha to Bangladesh.\n\n\n\n"}

Notoriously the field emerged after the work of Chaïm Perelman and Lucille Olbrechts-Tyteca in their book \"The New Rhetoric\" (1969) but both the notion and the idea for the need of \"new\" rhetoric, different from the \"old\" one can be traced to the works of Kenneth Burke - \"A Rhetoric of Motives\" (1950) and \"Rhetoric - Old and New\" (1967).\n\nWhat helped the emergence of New rhetoric was the ideas of the epistemic status of rhetoric, the notion of a clearly definable rhetorical core and other.\n\nNew rhetorics attempts to preserve the original field but it also has tense relationship with it. For example, New Rhetoric attempts to break up with the formalistic and logocentric (i.e. patriarchal) Neo-Aristotelian analysis in favour of interplay between text and context, but according to DeGenaro it does not succeed to place itself outside the \"Western-patriarchal\" with being unable to departure from \"elite backgrounds and scopes of study\" to a diversity of voices, topics, etc. This probably makes New Rhetoric rather a ground for the postmodern rhetoric which \"puts into question the identities of the speaker, the audience, and the messages that pass between them\" with evaluating the intersubjective philosophy because of the inherently accepted in the postmodernistic philosophy idea that \"differences cannot be overcome, in Hegelian fashion, by cancelling them under a higher-order synthesis, but must be eroded or defaced in the course of traversing them.\"\n"}

{"id": "16209697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16209697", "title": "Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture", "text": "Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture\n\nThe term Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture, Norman-Sicilian culture or, less inclusive, Norman-Arab culture, (sometimes referred to as the \"Arab-Norman civilization\") refers to the interaction of the Norman, Latin, Arab and Byzantine Greek cultures following the Norman conquest of Sicily and of Norman Africa from 1061 to around 1250. This civilization resulted from numerous exchanges in the cultural and scientific fields, based on the tolerance showed by the Normans towards the Greek-speaking populations and the Muslim settlers. As a result, Sicily under the Normans became a crossroad for the interaction between the Norman and Latin Catholic, Byzantine-Orthodox and Arab-Islamic cultures.\n\nIn 965 Muslims completed their conquest of Sicily from the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire following the fall of the final significant Greek citadel of Taormina in 962. Seventy three years later, in 1038, Byzantine forces began a reconquest of Sicily under the Greek general George Maniakes. This invasion relied on a number of Norse mercenaries, the Varangians, including the future king of Norway Harald Hardrada, as well as on several contingents of Normans. Although Maniakes' death in a Byzantine civil war in 1043 cut the invasion short, the Normans followed up on the advances made by the Byzantines and completed the conquest of the island from the Saracens. The Normans had been expanding south, as mercenaries and adventurers, driven by the myth of a happy and sunny island in the Southern Seas. The Norman Robert Guiscard, son of Tancred, invaded Sicily in 1060. The island was split politically between three Arab emirs, and the sizable Byzantine Christian population rebelled against the ruling Muslims. One year later Messina fell to troops under the leadership of Roger Bosso (the brother of Robert Guiscard and the future Count Roger I of Sicily), and in 1071 the Normans took Palermo. The loss of the cities, each with a splendid harbor, dealt a severe blow to Muslim power on the island. Eventually Normans took all of Sicily. In 1091, Noto in the southern tip of Sicily and the island of Malta, the last Arab strongholds, fell to the Christians.\n\nBy the 11th century Muslim power in the Mediterranean had begun to wane.\nUnder Norman rule, Palermo confirmed its role as one of the great capitals of Europe and the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Kingdom of Africa was an extension of the frontier zone of the Siculo-Norman state in the former Roman province of Africa (\"Ifrīqiya\" in Tunisian Arabic), corresponding to Tunisia and parts of Algeria and Libya today. The main primary sources for the kingdom are Arabic (Muslim); the Latin (Christian) sources are scanter. According to Hubert Houben, since \"Africa\" was never mentioned in the royal title of the kings of Sicily, \"one ought not to speak of a ‘Norman kingdom of Africa’.\" Rather, \"[Norman Africa] really amounted to a constellation of Norman-held towns along coastal Ifrīqiya.\"\n\nThe Sicilian conquest of Africa began under Roger II in 1146–48. Sicilian rule consisted of military garrisons in the major towns, exactions on the local Muslim population, protection of Christians and the minting of coin. The local aristocracy was largely left in place, and Muslim princes controlled the civil government under Sicilian oversight. Economic connections between Sicily and Africa, which were strong before the conquest, were strengthened, while ties between Africa and northern Italy were expanded. Early in the reign of William I, the \"kingdom\" of Africa fell to the Almohads (1158–60). Its most enduring legacy was the realignment of Mediterranean powers brought about by its demise and the Siculo-Almohad peace finalised in 1180.\n\nAn intense Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture developed, exemplified by rulers such as Roger II of Sicily, who had Islamic soldiers, poets and scientists at his court, and had Byzantine Greeks, Christodoulos, the famous George of Antioch, and finally Philip of Mahdia, serve successively as his \"ammiratus ammiratorum\" (\"emir of emirs\"). Roger II himself spoke Arabic and was fond of Arab culture. He used Arab and Byzantine Greek troops and siege engines in his campaigns in southern Italy, and mobilized Arab and Byzantine architects to help his Normans build monuments in the Norman-Arab-Byzantine style. The various agricultural and industrial techniques which had been introduced by the Arabs in Sicily during the preceding two centuries were kept and further developed, allowing for the remarkable prosperity of the Island. Numerous Classical Greek works, long lost to the Latin speaking West, were translated from Byzantine Greek manuscripts found in Sicily directly into Latin. For the following two hundred years, Sicily under Norman rule became a model which was widely admired throughout Europe and Arabia.\n\nThe English historian John Julius Norwich remarked of the Kingdom of Sicily:\n\"Norman Sicily stood forth in Europe --and indeed in the whole bigoted medieval world-- as an example of tolerance and enlightenment, a lesson in the respect that every man should feel for those whose blood and beliefs happen to differ from his own.\"John Julius Norwich\n\nDuring Roger II's reign, the Kingdom of Sicily became increasingly characterized by its multi-ethnic composition and unusual religious tolerance. Catholic Normans, Langobards and native Sicilians, Muslim Arabs, and Orthodox Byzantine Greeks existed in a relative harmony for this time period, and Roger II was known to have planned for the establishment of an Empire that would have encompassed Fatimid Egypt and the Crusader states in the Levant up until his death in 1154. One of the greatest geographical treatises of the Middle Ages was written for Roger II by the Andalusian scholar Muhammad al-Idrisi, and entitled Kitab Rudjdjar (\"The book of Roger\").\n\nAt the end of the 12th century, the population of Sicily is estimated to have been up to one-third Byzantine Greek speaking, with the remainder speaking Latin or Vulgar Latin dialects brought from mainland Italy (Gallo-Italic languages and Neapolitan language), Norman and Sicilian Arabic. Although the language of the court was Old Norman or Old French (Langue d'oïl), all royal edicts were written in the language of the people they were addressed to: Latin, Byzantine Greek, Arabic, or Hebrew. Roger's royal mantel, used for his coronation (and also used for the coronation of Frederick II), bore an inscription in Arabic with the Hijri date of 528 (1133–1134).\n\nIslamic authors marvelled at the forbearance of the Norman kings:\n\"They [the Muslims] were treated kindly, and they were protected, even against the Franks. Because of that, they had great love for king Roger.\"Ibn al-Athir\n\nInteractions continued with the succeeding Norman kings, for example under William II of Sicily, as attested by the Spanish-Arab geographer Ibn Jubair who landed in the island after returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1184. To his surprise, Ibn Jubair enjoyed a very warm reception by the Norman Christians. He was further surprised to find that even some Christians spoke Arabic and that several government officials were Muslim:\n\"The attitude of the king is really extraordinary. His attitude towards the Muslims is perfect: he gives them employment, he choses his officers among them, and all, or almost all, keep their faith secret and can remain faithful to the faith of Islam. The king has full confidence in the Muslims and relies on them to handle many of his affairs, including the most important ones, to the point that the Great Intendant for cooking is a Muslim (...) His viziers and chamberlains are eunuchs, of which there are many, who are the members of his government and on whom he relies for his private affairs.\"Ibn Jubair, \"Rihla\".\nIbn Jubair mentioned that some Christians in Palermo wore the Muslim dress and spoke Arabic. The Norman kings continued to strike coins in Arabic with Hegira dates. The registers at the Royal court were written in Arabic. At one point, William II of Sicily is recorded to have said: \"Every one of you should invoke the one he adores and of whom he follows the faith\".\n\nNumerous artistic techniques from the Byzantine and Islamic world were also incorporated to form the basis of Arab-Norman art: inlays in mosaics or metals, sculpture of ivory or porphyry, sculpture of hard stones, bronze foundries, manufacture of silk (for which Roger II established a \"regium ergasterium\", a state enterprise which would give Sicily the monopoly of silk manufacture for all Western Europe). During a raid on the Byzantine Empire, Roger II's admiral George of Antioch had transported the silk weavers from Thebes, Greece, where they had formed a part of the, until then, closely guarded monopoly that was the Byzantine silk industry.\n\nThe new Norman rulers started to build various constructions in what is called the Arab-Norman style. They incorporated the best practices of Arab and Byzantine architecture into their own art.\n\nThe Church of Saint-John of the Hermits, was built in Palermo by Roger II around 1143–1148 in such a style. The church is notable for its brilliant red domes, which show clearly the persistence of Arab influences in Sicily at the time of its reconstruction in the 12th century. In her \"Diary of an Idle Woman in Sicily\", Frances Elliot described it as \"... totally oriental... it would fit well in Baghdad or Damascus\". The bell tower, with four orders of arcaded loggias, is instead a typical example of Gothic architecture.\n\nThe Cappella Palatina, also in Palermo, combines harmoniously a variety of styles: the Norman architecture and door decor, the Arabic arches and scripts adorning the roof, the Byzantine dome and mosaics. For instance, clusters of four eight-pointed stars, typical for Muslim design, are arranged on the ceiling so as to form a Christian cross.\n\nThe Monreale cathedral is generally described as \"Norman-Arab-Byzantine\". The outsides of the principal doorways and their pointed arches are magnificently enriched with carving and colored inlay, a curious combination of three styles—Norman-French, Byzantine and Arab.\n\nThe Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio built in 1143 by Roger II's \"emir of emirs\" George of Antioch was originally consecrated as a Greek Orthodox church, according to its Greek-Arab bilingual foundation charter, and was built in the Byzantine Greek cross style with some Arab influences. Another unusual church from this period is the country church of Santi Pietro e Paolo d’Agrò in Casalvecchio Siculo; it has been described \"one of the most sophisticated and coherent works of architecture to emerge from the Norman rule of the island\".\n\nOther examples of Arab-Norman architecture include the Palazzo dei Normanni, or Castelbuono. This style of construction persisted until the 14th and the 15th century, exemplified by the use of the cupola.\n\nThe points of contact between Europe and Islamic lands were multiple during the Middle Ages, with Sicily playing a key role in the transmission of knowledge to Europe, although less important than that of Spain. The main points of transmission of Islamic knowledge to Europe were in Sicily, and in Islamic Spain, particularly in Toledo (with Gerard of Cremone, 1114–1187, following the conquest of the city by the Spanish Christians in 1085). Many exchanges also occurred in the Levant due to the presence of the Crusaders there.\n\nArabic and Greek art and science continued to be influential in Sicily during the two centuries following the Norman conquest. Norman rule formally ended in 1198 with the reign of Constance of Sicily, and was replaced by that of the Swabian Hohenstaufen Dynasty.\n\nIn 1224 however, Frederick II, responding to religious uprisings in Sicily, expelled all Muslims from the island, transferring many to Lucera over the next two decades. In this controlled environment, they couldn't challenge royal authority and they benefited the crown in taxes and military service. Their numbers eventually reached between 15,000 and 20,000, leading Lucera to be called \"Lucaera Saracenorum\" because it represented the last stronghold of Islamic presence in Italy. The colony thrived for 75 years until it was sacked in 1300 by Christian forces under the command of Charles II of Naples. The city's Muslim inhabitants were exiled or sold into slavery, with many finding asylum in Albania across the Adriatic Sea. Their abandoned mosques were destroyed or converted, and churches arose upon the ruins, including the cathedral S. Maria della Vittoria.\n\nEven under Manfred (died in 1266) Islamic influence in Sicily persisted, but it had almost disappeared by the beginning of the 14th century. Latin progressively replaced Arabic and Greek, the last Sicilian document in the Arabic language is dated to 1245.\n\n"}

It was released on January 7, 2014 on OS X and Linux through the Humble Indie Bundle X. The game involves a young Brazilian boy Quico who, while hiding from his abusive, alcoholic father, finds himself taken to a dream-like favela, and meeting a normally docile creature, Monster. The player, as Quico, can interact with Monster and manipulate the buildings of the favela in unique ways, such as by stacking individual shacks on each other, to complete puzzles and progress in the game. \"Papo & Yo\" was designed by Vander Caballero, who created the story based on his own past in dealing with an abusive, alcoholic father.\n\nThe game takes place in an unspecified Brazilian favela which the player has to navigate. The player takes on the role of Quico, a young boy who has run away from his home to escape his abusive and alcoholic father. Quico has the ability to turn the environment into a magical and dream-like world. For example, tugging a glowing thread can pull a stairway out of the side of a building, lifting a cardboard box can cause an entire building to come unmoored from its foundations, shacks can sprout legs and scuttle into place to provide a handy bridge. According to Ars Technica's website \"there's a sense of childlike imagination at play in the way the game adds a layer of magic into the rundown world, and it's likely to make you look at your own surroundings a little differently after you play\".\n\nOne of the key elements of the game is Monster, a giant that Quico discovers while navigating through the slums. Monster at first appears to be very kind and helpful. He can be made to hold down pressure plates and his belly can be used as a super-trampoline to reach rooftops. Monster has an addiction for eating frogs and if he eats one he becomes a fiery, raging beast that will damage anything around him, even Quico if he cannot get away quickly enough. The player can use a fruit to calm him.\n\nQuico is a young Brazilian boy that has been abused by his alcoholic father. While hiding in his closet during one of his father's drunken rages, clutching his favorite toy, a robot doll named Lula, Quico discovers a strange chalk mark on the wall, and touching it, finds himself taken to a dream-like world. There, a young girl named Alejandra initially sees Quico as a threat, but comes to be a guide. Lula also becomes animated and helps guide Quico through the world.\n\nQuico eventually comes upon a giant lumbering creature, simply known as Monster. Alejandra and Lula warn Quico about the dangers of Monster, but Quico finds the creature docile and playful. However, when Monster eats a frog, it becomes enraged, chasing after Quico until he can calm it with a rotten fruit. They proceed through the dream world, but during one episode when Monster is enraged, it damages Lula. Alejandra directs Quico to a temple where they can use the anger from Monster to revive Lula, but this requires luring the creature into giant traps meant to hurt it. Quico completes this task, and Lula is successfully revived, but the three are now chased by Monster. Alejandra is eventually caught and eaten by Monster, but not before she directs Quico to go to the Shaman to help cure the Monster.\n\nDuring these scenes, there are brief periods where Quico awakes in a dream and witnesses a past memory: that of his father accidentally running over a person with his car in a dark rainstorm. One such scene shows his father's shadow as that of Monster.\n\nQuico guides Monster to a sky-tram like device but Lula is forced to stay behind to operate it. The tram ends at the Shaman, but Quico finds there is no Shaman, only the memories of his father, and showing that he had fallen into his alcoholic and abusive state after the accident; Monster represents Quico's imagination of his father, while the frogs are a substitute for his father's alcoholism. A voice warns him that Monster cannot be cured and Quico must let him go. After calming Monster to sleep, Quico reluctantly pushes Monster into an abyss, and then follows a path that returns him back to his closet in the real world.\n\nAnnounced on 3 June 2011, at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), the game marked the debut release for Montreal-based studio Minority. Development of \"Papo & Yo\" was supported by Sony's Pub Fund scheme, which provides financial support to small-scale developers.\n\n\"Papo & Yo\" was released on the PlayStation Network on August 14, 2012 as part of the second annual PlayStation Network (PSN) Play promotion.\n\nDeveloper Minority announced a soundtrack release (composed by Brian D’Oliveira) on PSN in a blog post, with a scheduled release date of December 18, 2012 in North America and one day later for Europe.\n\nIt is available on digital distributors such as the PlayStation Network, iTunes Store, Amazon.com, Steam, SoundCloud, etc.\n\n"}

This episode focuses on the ship's chief medical officer, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), who notices that her friends — and every trace of them — are vanishing around her.\n\nThe \"Enterprise\" docks at Starbase 133, where Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) greets her elderly friend and mentor, Dr. Dalen Quaice (Bill Erwin). After taking him to his quarters discussing the loss of old friends, Dr. Crusher visits her son Ensign Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) in Engineering. Wesley attempts to create a static warp bubble but the experiment appears to fail. As the \"Enterprise\" leaves Starbase, Dr. Crusher finds that Dr. Quaice seems to have gone missing, with no record of him coming aboard the ship. As she performs a medical test on transporter chief O'Brien (Colm Meaney), she realizes that her medical staff are missing; further investigation and discussion with the crew shows that she has always worked alone in sick bay.\n\nDr. Crusher continues to try to track down the disappearing people, and finds more and more crew members that she remembers being completely unknown to the crew or the computer. At one point, a vortex appears near Dr. Crusher and attempts to pull her in, but she is able to hold on to a fixture until it dissipates; the ship shows no record of the vortex's appearance when she investigates. Eventually, no one but Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and herself remain on the ship, but Picard believes that the situation is normal. Dr. Crusher orders the computer to give Picard's vital signs over the ship's speakers so that she knows he is still there, but shortly thereafter even he disappears. Then the vortex reappears, and once again tries to claim Beverly. She is blown across the bridge, but she manages to hang onto Commander Data's (Brent Spiner) chair until the vortex disappears.\n\nAt this point, the viewer is shown the actual \"Enterprise\", where Wesley had successfully created the warp bubble, accidentally trapping his mother within it. With the warp bubble collapsing rapidly, Wesley's fears lead The Traveler (Eric Menyuk) to appear and help Wesley attempt to stabilize the bubble. The Traveler recommends the \"Enterprise\" return to the Starbase, where the warp bubble was formed and may be more stable.\n\nWithin the warp bubble, Dr. Crusher attempts to direct the \"Enterprise\" to the home planet of the Traveler, but soon finds the ship is unable to set that destination as it no longer exists. More of the universe she knows disappears, soon leaving only the \"Enterprise\". She recognizes the shape as being that of Wesley's warp bubbles, and determines that she is trapped, the earlier vortex being the \"Enterprise\" crew's first attempt to save her. As the warp bubble shrinks, erasing parts of the \"Enterprise\", she races for Engineering, the center of the warp bubble, and finds a vortex waiting there. She jumps in at the last moment, finding herself back in Engineering along with Picard, Wesley, and the Traveler. After assuring herself that everyone she knows, including her guest Dr. Quaice, is aboard the \"Enterprise\", she thanks the Traveler for his help.\n\n\n\n"}

With the passing of the 1996 Fisheries Act, a rāhui can also be imposed by the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries. In the Cook Islands, Raui (rahui) have been put in place by the National Environment Service.\n\nRāhui may be imposed for many reasons, including a perceived need for conservation of food resources or because the area concerned is in a state of 'tapu', due, for example, to a recent death in the area, out of respect for the dead and to prevent the gathering of food there for a specified period. Rāhui may be placed on land, sea, rivers, forests, gardens, fishing grounds, and other food resources. A rāhui is given its authority by the mana of the person or group that imposes it. (Barlow 1994:104).\n\nAn area may be set aside for a special purpose or function. Trees may be set aside as a carving resource; or flax bushes for the weaving of a special cloak for a chief. Areas may be placed under rāhui requiring them to be left to lie fallow so that the resources may regenerate.\n\nThe custom of rāhui is still used today, and it has similarities to the bans imposed by the present day legal system on the gathering of food resources for conservation purposes; however Māori often perceive such bans on the gathering of traditional resources such as shellfish and native birds as 'another denial of their customary rights.' \n\nA sign or physical symbol may be displayed to show that a rāhui has been imposed. Sometimes a carved or decorated wooden stick or post may be placed in the ground. Natural features of the landscape can indicate the boundaries of the area that is under restriction. Additionally, people will be informed about the placing of the rāhui.\n\nThe imposing of rāhui by Māori iwi has no official legal standing, and penalties are not formally imposed upon anyone breaking a rāhui, but it is seen as culturally insensitive to do so, and in general all members of the public tend to respect the tradition.\n\n"}
{"id": "2518073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2518073", "title": "Standard social science model", "text": "Standard social science model\n\nThe term standard social science model (SSSM) was first introduced by John Tooby and Leda Cosmides in the 1992 edited volume \"The Adapted Mind\". They used SSSM as a reference to social science philosophies related to the blank slate, relativism, social constructionism, and cultural determinism. They argue that those philosophies, capsulized within SSSM, formed the dominant theoretical paradigm in the development of the social sciences during the 20th century. According to their proposed SSSM paradigm, the mind is a general-purpose cognitive device shaped almost entirely by culture. After establishing SSSM, Tooby and Cosmides make a case for replacing SSSM with the integrated model (IM), also known as the integrated causal model (ICM), which melds cultural and biological theories for the development of the mind. Supporters of SSSM include those who feel the term was conceived as a point of argument in support of ICM specifically and evolutionary psychology (EP) in general.\n\nSteven Pinker names several prominent scientists as proponents of the standard social science model, including Franz Boas, Margaret Mead, B. F. Skinner, Richard Lewontin, John Money, and Stephen Jay Gould.\n\nThe authors of \"The Adapted Mind\" have argued that the SSSM is now out of date and that a progressive model for the social sciences requires evolutionarily-informed models of nature-nurture interactionism, grounded in the computational theory of mind. Tooby and Cosmides refer to this new model as the integrated model (IM).\n\nTooby and Cosmides provide several comparisons between the SSSM and the IM, including the following:\n\nRichardson (2007) argues that, as proponents of evolutionary psychology (EP), evolutionary psychologists developed the SSSM as a rhetorical technique: The basic move is evident in Cosmides and Tooby's most aggressive brief for evolutionary psychology. They want us to accept a dichotomy between what they call the \"Standard Social Science Model\" (SSSM) and the \"Integrated Causal Model\" (ICM) they favor ... it offers a false dichotomy between a manifestly untenable view and their own. Wallace (2010) has also suggested the SSSM to be a false dichotomy and claims that \"scientists in the EP tradition wildly overstate the influence and longevity of what they call the Standard Social Science Model (essentially, behaviorism) of human cognition\".\n\nGeoffrey Sampson argues that the SSSM is based on a straw man. He views Pinker's claim that the SSSM has been the dominant theoretical paradigm in the social sciences since the 1920s as \"completely untenable\". In his argument, Sampson cites British education policies in the 20th century that were guided by social scientists and which were based on the belief that children had in-built talents and needs. Thus, he challenges Pinker's assertion that the view of the mind among all social scientists is a tabula rasa. Moreover, Sampson only conditionally agrees that the scientists Pinker associates with the SSSM, such as Skinner, Watson, and Mead, were influential, stating, \"to identify them as responsible for the general tone of intellectual life for eighty years seems comical\". Similarly, Neil Levy appears to concur with Sampson's straw man thesis regarding the conception of the SSSM, against which evolutionary psychologists direct much of their criticism. Levy writes: \"No-one—not even Skinner and his followers—has ever believed in the blank slate of Pinker's title.\"\n\nHilary Rose has criticized Tooby and Cosmides' arbitrary exclusion of economics and political science from their SSSM model, which Rose argues is \"rather like excluding physiology and biochemistry from an account of the life sciences\". She also states that Tooby and Cosmides have publicly indicted sociologists and anthropologists of inappropriate separatist behavior towards other academic disciplines while ignoring their newer efforts that demonstrate the complete opposite. Rose notes how sociologists and anthropologists have many new developments that involve study of the natural sciences and technology. Furthermore, Rose suggests that Tooby and Cosmides' characterization of scientists like Gould, Lewontin, Steven Rose and Leon Kamin as SSSM adherents is based on an inaccurate reading of works like \"The Mismeasure of Man\" and \"Not in Our Genes\", two books that have explored the interplay between biology and the environment.\n\nSimon Hampton (2004) contends that evolutionary psychologists' account of the SSSM misses the debate on the existence of psychological instincts in the early part of the 20th century. He argues: psychological and behavioural thinkers have for long periods been immersed in the implications of Darwinism. It is plainly and factually incorrect for evolutionary psychology to deny this. And it is disingenuous to down-play it. Evolutionary psychologists who use the term \"Standard Social Science Model\" and rhetorical equivalents such as \"the neo-behaviourist tradition\" ... and \"the tabula rasa view\" ... undermine their own much-vaunted rigor.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56214", "title": "Surcoat", "text": "Surcoat\n\nA surcoat or surcote initially was an outer garment commonly worn in the Middle Ages by both men and women in Western Europe. It can either refer to a coat worn over other clothes or the outermost garment itself. The name derives from French meaning \"over the coat\", a long, loose, often sleeveless coat reaching down to the feet.\n\nFrom about the 12th century, knights wore long, flowing surcoats, frequently emblazoned with their personal arms, over their armor. These usually extended to about midcalf, had slits in the bottom front and back, thus allowing the wearer to ride comfortably and were either sleeved or sleeveless. Historians believe that the practice of wearing white ones was adopted during the Crusades, their main purpose of reflecting the direct sun, which overheated it (and the soldier inside); while in poor weather they helped keep rain and the muck of battle away from the easily corroded mail links; although it may be argued that here its color would have been of little help. The surcoat displayed the device of the knight (origin of the term \"coat of arms\") thus identifying him; which in turn, combined with the increased use of the great helm (late 12th century, early 13th century) became an essential means of recognition. Indeed, some historians cite this as one of the reasons behind the spread of heraldry across medieval Europe. During the 13th century, knights began to add plates of armour to their surcoats, that subsequently became the medieval coat of plates. In the early fourteenth century, the front of the knight's surcoat was shortened, so that it was longer at the back, knee-length at the front; thus allowing greater freedom of movement, and eliminating the danger of a rider getting his spurs caught in the garment. By the mid-fourteenth century it was replaced with the \"jupon\" (or \"gipon\"), a much shorter item, often padded for supplementary protection.\n\nIn the 15th century, once suits of plate armour became common, the surcoat was phased out of use. The period in the history of armour development, in which surcoats became increasingly rare, is referred to as the \"surcoatless period\" (1420-1485).\n\nWomen began wearing surcoats during the 13th century, both with and without sleeves. A particular style, known as the sideless surcoat, developed as a fashion in the 14th century. This was a sleeveless, floor-length garment featuring exaggerated armholes, which at their most extreme were open from shoulder to hip, revealing the gown underneath. The narrow strip covering the torso, known as the plackard, was usually no more than a foot wide. The style drew criticism from some moralists, who thought the garment drew an inappropriate amount of attention to the female body. Despite this, sideless surcoats continued to be worn as ceremonial dress well into the 15th century, long after they had ceased to be fashionable. Some estimates place them being worn as state apparel as late as 1525.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "664462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=664462", "title": "Upholstery", "text": "Upholstery\n\nUpholstery is the work of providing furniture, especially seats, with padding, springs, webbing, and fabric or leather covers. The word \"upholstery\" comes from the Middle English word \"upholder\", which referred to an artisan who held up their goods. The term is equally applicable to domestic, automobile, airplane and boat furniture, and can be applied to mattresses, particularly the upper layers, though these often differ significantly in design. A person who works with upholstery is called an upholsterer. An apprentice upholsterer is sometimes called an outsider or trimmer. Traditional upholstery uses materials like coil springs (post-1850), animal hair (horse, hog and cow), coir, straw and hay, hessians, linen scrims, wadding, etc., and is done by hand, building each layer up. In contrast, today's upholsterers employ synthetic materials like dacron and vinyl, serpentine springs, and so on.\n\n\"Upholder\" is an archaic term used for \"upholsterer\", but it appears to have a connotation of \"repairing\" furniture rather than creating new upholstered pieces from scratch (cobbler vs. cordwainer).\n\nIn 18th-century London, upholders frequently served as interior decorators responsible for all aspects of a room's decor. These individuals were members of the Worshipful Company of Upholders, whose traditional role, prior to the 18th century, was to provide upholstery and textiles and the fittings for funerals. In the great London furniture-making partnerships of the 18th century, a cabinet-maker usually paired with an upholder: Vile and Cobb, Ince and Mayhew, Chippendale and Rannie or Haig.\n\nIn the US, Grand Rapids, Michigan and Hickory, North Carolina are centers for furniture manufacture along with Long Eaton, Nottinghamshire (England) and many of the best upholsterers can still be found there. These artisans continue to create or recreate many antique and modern pieces of furniture.\n\nFurniture reupholstery continues to thrive in the UK with several businesses small and large providing these services. \nTraditional upholstery is a craft which evolved over centuries for padding and covering chairs, seats and sofas, before the development of sewing machines, synthetic fabrics and plastic foam. Using a solid wood or webbed platform, it can involve the use of springs, lashings, stuffings of animal hair, grasses and coir, wools, hessians, scrims, bridle ties, stuffing ties, blind stitching, top stitching, flocks and wadding all built up by hand.\nIn the Middle Ages, domestic interiors were becoming more comfortable and upholstery was playing an important part in interior decoration. The decorations consisted mainly of what we would now consider as \"soft furnishings\", though there were simple platforms of webbing, canvas or leather for stools, chairs and elaborately decorated coverings that already demonstrated the rudimentary beginnings of upholstered furniture. By the beginning of the 17th century chair seats were being padded, but this form of upholstery was still fairly basic. All sorts of stuffings from sawdust, grass, feathers, to deer, goat or horsehair were used, although in England the Livery Company forbade the use of goat and deer hair and imposed fines for misdemeanors. The stuffing was heaped on a wooden platform and held in place with a decorative top fabric and nails. This produced a simple dome shape sloping towards the seat. Only towards the end of the 17th century did upholsterers start to develop the techniques that would distribute and shape the stuffing into more controlled shapes. Curled horsehair was being used more consistently for stuffing that was easier to hold in place with stitches in twine that were developed from saddlery techniques. Thus layers of stuffing could be distributed evenly and secured to stay in place. On a basic level, squab cushions were made more stable by using tufting ties. Stuffed edge rolls appeared on seat fronts providing support for cushions to be retained and later for deeper stuffing to be held in place under a fixed top cover.\n\nWhat we now think of as \"classic\" upholstery shapes and techniques flourished in the 18th century. Frames of elegant line and proportion were sympathetically matched by expertly executed upholstery. By now, the upholsterers' technical knowledge meant that stuffing's could be controlled along upright and sloping lines, giving new levels of comfort and a simply stated elegance. Later in the century, the border was replaced by a single piece of linen or scrim taken over the stuffed seat and tacked to the frame. At the same time the locked blind stitch and top-stitching combination (pulling the side and top surfaces together and bringing the stuffing up to make a firm top edge) had evolved.\n\nIn the Victorian era, fashions of opulence and comfort gave rise to excesses of stuffing and padding. Mass production techniques made upholstered furniture available in large quantity to all sections of society. The availability of better-quality steel springs and the development of lashing techniques enabled upholstery to be built up on seats, backs and arms quite independently of the frame shape. Stuffings became even more complex, edges became elaborately shaped into rolls and scrolls and fabrics were folded into soft padded shapes by means of buttoning.\n\nAn automotive upholsterer, also known as a trimmer, coach trimmer or motor trimmer, shares many of the skills required in upholstery, in addition to being able to work with carpet.\n\nThe term coach trimmer derives from the days when car frames were produced by manufacturers and delivered to coach builders to add a car body and interior trimmings. Trimmers would produce soft furnishings, carpets, soft tops, and roof linings often to order to customer specifications. Later, trim shops were often an in-house part of the production line as the production process was broken down into smaller parts manageable by semi-skilled labor.\n\nMany automotive trimmers now work either in automotive design or with aftermarket trim shops carrying out repairs, restorations or conversions for customers directly. A few high-quality motor car manufacturers still employ trimmers, for example, Aston Martin.\n\nThis is the type of upholstery work offered to businesses. Examples would be restaurant seating consisting of booth seats, dining room chairs, bar stools, etc. Also churches, including but not limited to pews and chairs for the congregation, hospitals and clinics consisting of medical tables, chiropractic tables, dental chairs, etc. Also common to this type of upholstery would be lobby and waiting-area seating. Upholstered walls are found in some retail premises.\n\nUpholsterers may be called upon to repair or replace seating, cushions, cabin furnishings, headliners and even carpeting on boats.\n\nMarine upholstery differs in that one has to consider dampness, sunlight and hard usage. There are many sources for marine grade vinyls such as Spradling and Morbern and they come in hundreds of colors and styles now.\n\nEach style of marine grade vinyl is rated according to cold crack, rub counts, and mold resistance.\nStainless-steel hardware such as staples, screws must be used to prevent rust and early break down of hardware and fasteners. The newest products for fastening vinyl in marine applications are Tenara thread and Monel staples. Any wood used must be of marine quality.\n\nUsually a high-resiliency, high-density plastic foam with a thin film of plastic over it is used to keep out water that might get by the seams. Closed-cell foam is used on smaller cushions which can, sometimes, double as flotation devices.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is voiced by Billy West, but was originally intended to be voiced by Phil Hartman, with West taking over the role after Hartman's death. The character is based on the \"Star Trek\" captain James T. Kirk, played by William Shatner. The show's executive producer David X. Cohen has described Brannigan as \"half Captain Kirk, half actual William Shatner\".\n\nBrannigan is a 25-Star General in the Democratic Order of Planets, and captain of its flagship, the \"Nimbus\". He is first introduced in the fourth episode of the series, \"Love's Labours Lost in Space\", in which he plays a major role. In the episode, Brannigan becomes enamored with Leela, whom he attempts to woo for the remainder of the series. Brannigan is portrayed as a respected military hero in the eyes of his superiors and the general public, but strongly disliked by his own crew, most notably his long suffering second-in-command, Kif Kroker. Though famed for his bravery and strategic genius, it soon becomes very apparent that he is sexist, vain, stupid and often very cowardly and inept.\n\nBrannigan is a senior member of the military of the Democratic Order of Planets (D.O.O.P.) though his title varies; he has been referred to as a \"25-star General\", Captain, \"General Major Webelo\", \"Rear Brigadier\", and \"Commodore 64.\" Brannigan is widely revered in military circles for his numerous victories over hostile aliens. However, almost all of these victories tend to come from using excessive force to subdue comically weak opponents, or the use of tactics that rely on large numbers and wanton disregard for the safety of his men.\n\nSoon after first meeting him, Leela has sex with him. He mentions this encounter repeatedly in later episodes while remaining convinced that Leela lusts after him despite her vocal (and often violent) opposition to the idea.\n\nBrannigan's Law forbids interfering with an undeveloped planet, a parody of the Prime Directive from \"Star Trek\". Brannigan himself does not pretend to understand it, he merely enforces it, and even fails to uphold it on at least one occasion. Brannigan's Law is officially called \"Directive B10.8:1\". According to Brannigan, \"Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's love: hard and fast\".\n\nIn \"Brannigan, Begin Again\", Zapp was stripped of his command and court-martialed, but was reinstated as captain of the \"Nimbus\" over the course of the same episode.\n\nThe Nimbus, BP-1729, is the flagship of the fleet of the D.O.O.P. under Brannigan's command. The \"Nimbus\" is an extremely large vessel, capable of blockading or besieging entire planets single-handedly, and of transporting armies large enough for the pacification of the planet, all without the aid of support vessels. It is a parody of the \"Enterprise\" from \"\".\n\nBrannigan is based on the \"Star Trek\" captain James T. Kirk, played by William Shatner; Brannigan and Shatner meet face-to-face in the episode \"Where No Fan Has Gone Before\". The creators of the series envisioned Brannigan as similar to what Shatner himself would be like as a starship captain. Cohen describes him as being \"half Captain Kirk, half actual William Shatner\", and that the initial premise for the character was \"What if the real William Shatner was the captain of the \"Enterprise\" instead of Kirk?\". In the episode \"Amazon Women in the Mood\" the DVD audio commentary describes Zapp Brannigan's reinterpretation of \"Lola\" as a spoken word song as a reference to what William Shatner did with \"Rocket Man\". Brannigan also wears a girdle to appear thinner and in another episode nearly loses his toupee, seemingly a parody of similar accusations aimed at Shatner. Originally Brannigan was to appear fatter in every shot throughout the first episode in which he appeared, but the animators were so disgusted by his ultimate appearance that the idea was dropped.\n\nBrannigan's DOOP uniform is very similar to that of Magnus, Robot Fighter but he bears no other relation to that character.\n\nZapp Brannigan is voiced by Billy West, though he was originally intended to be voiced by Phil Hartman. Hartman insisted on auditioning for the role, and \"of course, just nailed it\" according to creator Matt Groening. However, due to Hartman's murder, West was given the role. On a \"Futurama\" DVD commentary, Groening reveals that Zapp's character and mannerisms were established in West's original audition for the character, and any similarity to Phil Hartman or his other well known cartoon characters (Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure) is simply coincidence. On the other hand, in an interview for the website TV Squad, Billy West states that his Zapp Brannigan is an imitation of Hartman and also \"modeled after a couple of big dumb announcers I knew.\"\n"}
