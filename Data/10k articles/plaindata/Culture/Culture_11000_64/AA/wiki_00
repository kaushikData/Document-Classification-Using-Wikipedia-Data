{"id": "12301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12301", "title": "A Song of Ice and Fire", "text": "A Song of Ice and Fire\n\nA Song of Ice and Fire is a series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter George R. R. Martin. He began the first volume of the series, \"A Game of Thrones,\" in 1991, and it was published in 1996. Martin, who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy, has published five out of a planned seven volumes. The fifth and most recent volume of the series published in 2011, \"A Dance with Dragons\", took Martin six years to write. He is currently writing the sixth novel, \"The Winds of Winter\".\n\n\"A Song of Ice and Fire\" takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to 31 characters by the fifth novel. Three main stories interweave: a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne.\n\nMartin's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels \"The Accursed Kings\" by Maurice Druon. \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion, as well as its realism. An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader, and the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured. Within the often morally ambiguous world of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of violence frequently arise.\n\n, the books have sold more than 70Â million copies worldwide and, , have been translated into 47 languages. The fourth and fifth volumes reached the top of \"The New York Times\" Best Seller lists upon their releases. Among the many derived works are several prequel novellas, a TV series, a comic book adaptation, and several card, board, and video games.\n\n\"A Song of Ice and Fire\" takes place in a fictional world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably. Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel, the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty by Aegon I and his sister wives Visenya and Rhaenys, establishing military supremacy through their control of dragons. Aegon became the first king of the entire continent of Westeros, save for the southerly region of Dorne. The Targaryen dynasty ruled for three hundred years, although civil war and infighting between the Targaryens resulted in the death of all their dragons. At the beginning of \"A Game of Thrones\", 15 peaceful years have passed since the rebellion led by Lord Robert Baratheon that deposed and killed the last Targaryen king, Aerys II \"the Mad King\", and proclaimed Robert king of the Seven Kingdoms, with a nine-year-long summer coming to an end.\n\nThe principal story chronicles the power struggle for the Iron Throne among the great Houses of Westeros following the death of King Robert in \"A Game of Thrones\". Robert's heir apparent, the 13-year-old Joffrey, is immediately proclaimed king through the machinations of his mother, Queen Cersei Lannister. When Lord Eddard \"Ned\" Stark, Robert's closest friend and chief advisor, discovers that Joffrey and his siblings are the product of incest between Cersei and her twin brother Jaime \"The Kingslayer\" Lannister, Eddard attempts to unseat Joffrey, but is betrayed and executed for treason. In response, Robert's brothers Stannis and Renly both lay separate claims to the throne. During this period of instability, two of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros attempt to become independent from the Iron Throne: Eddard's eldest son Robb is proclaimed King in the North, while Lord Balon Greyjoy desires to recover the sovereignty of his region, the Iron Islands. The so-called \"War of the Five Kings\" is in full progress by the middle of the second book, \"A Clash of Kings\".\n\nThe second part of story takes place in the far north of Westeros, where an 8,000-year-old wall of ice, simply called \"the Wall\", defends the Seven Kingdoms from supernatural creatures known as the Others. The Wall's sentinels, the Sworn Brotherhood of the Night's Watch, also protect the realm from the incursions of the \"wildlings\" or \"Free Folk\", who are several human tribes living on the north side of the Wall. The Night's Watch story is told primarily through the point of view of Jon Snow, Lord Eddard Stark's bastard son. Jon follows the footsteps of his uncle Benjen Stark and joins the Watch at a young age, rising quickly through the ranks. He eventually becomes Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. In the third volume, \"A Storm of Swords\", the Night's Watch storyline becomes increasingly entangled with the War of the Five Kings.\n\nThe third storyline follows Daenerys Targaryen, daughter of Aerys II, the last Targaryen king. On the continent of Essos, east of Westeros across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is married off by her elder brother Viserys Targaryen to a powerful warlord, but slowly becomes an independent and intelligent ruler in her own right. Her rise to power is aided by the historic birth of three dragons, hatched from eggs given to her as wedding gifts. The three dragons soon become not only a symbol of her bloodline and her legitimate claim to the throne, but also devastating weapons of war, which help her in conquest of the Slaver's bay.\n\nBooks in the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series are first published in hardcover and are later re-released as paperback editions. In the UK, Harper Voyager publishes special slipcased editions. The series has also been translated into more than 30 languages. All page totals given below are for the US first editions.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin was already a successful fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" book series. Martin had published his first short story in 1971 and his first novel in 1977. By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction. Although his early books were well-received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s. He worked principally on the revival of \"The Twilight Zone\" throughout 1986 and on \"Beauty and the Beast\" until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.\n\nWhen Martin was between Hollywood projects in the summer of 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called \"Avalon\". After three chapters, he had a vivid idea of a boy seeing a man's beheading and finding direwolves in the snow, which would eventually become the first non-prologue chapter of \"A Game of Thrones\". Putting \"Avalon\" aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew certain that it was part of a longer story. After a few more chapters, Martin perceived his new book as a fantasy story and started making maps and genealogies. However, the writing of this book was interrupted for a few years when Martin returned to Hollywood to produce his TV series \"Doorways\" that ABC had ordered but ultimately never aired.\n\nIn 1994, Martin gave his agent, Kirby McCauley, the first 200 pages and a two-page story projection as part of a planned trilogy with the novels \"A Dance with Dragons\" and \"The Winds of Winter\" intended to follow. When Martin had still not reached the novel's end at 1400 manuscript pages, he felt that the series needed to be four and eventually six books long, which he imagined as two linked trilogies of one long story. Martin chose \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" as the overall series title: Martin saw the struggle of the cold Others and the fiery dragons as one possible meaning for \"Ice and Fire\", whereas the word \"song\" had previously appeared in Martin's book titles \"A Song for Lya\" and \"Songs the Dead Men Sing\", stemming from his obsessions with songs. Martin also named Robert Frost's 1920 poem \"Fire and Ice\" and cultural associations such as passion versus betrayal as possible influences for the series' title.\n\nThe revised finished manuscript for \"A Game of Thrones\" was 1088 pages long (without the appendices), with the publication following in August 1996. \"Wheel of Time\" author Robert Jordan had written a short endorsement for the cover that was influential in ensuring the book's and hence series' early success with fantasy readers. \"Blood of the Dragon\", a pre-release sample novella drawn from Daenerys's chapters, went on to win the 1997 Hugo Award for Best Novella.\n\nThe 300 pages removed from the \"A Game of Thrones\" manuscript served as the opening of the second book, entitled \"A Clash of Kings\". It was released in February 1999 in the United States, with a manuscript length (without appendices) of 1184 pages. \"A Clash of Kings\" was the first book of the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series to make the best-seller lists, reaching 13 on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list in 1999. After the success of \"The Lord of the Rings\" films, Martin received his first inquiries to the rights of the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series from various producers and filmmakers.\n\nMartin was several months late turning in the third book, \"A Storm of Swords\". The last chapter he had written was about the \"Red Wedding\", a pivotal scene notable for its violence (see Themes: Violence and death). \"A Storm of Swords\" was 1521 pages in manuscript (without appendices), causing problems for many of Martin's publishers around the world. Bantam Books published \"A Storm of Swords\" in a single volume in the United States in November 2000, whereas some other-language editions were divided into two, three, or even four volumes. \"A Storm of Swords\" debuted at number 12 in the \"New York Times\" bestseller list.\n\nAfter \"A Game of Thrones\", \"A Clash of Kings\", and \"A Storm of Swords\", Martin originally intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled \"A Dance with Dragons\", was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after \"A Storm of Swords\" so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than \"A Storm of Swords\", Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to \"A Clash of Kings\". A long prologue was to establish what had happened in the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.\n\nIn 2001, Martin was still optimistic that the fourth installment might be released in the last quarter of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called \"A Feast for Crows\". The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap. The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.\n\nThe manuscript length of \"A Feast for Crows\" eventually surpassed \"A Storm of Swords\". Martin was reluctant to make the necessary deep cuts to get the book down to publishable length, as that would have compromised the story he had in mind. Printing the book in \"microtype on onion skin paper and giving each reader a magnifying glass\" was also not an option for him. On the other hand, Martin rejected the publishers' idea of splitting the narrative chronologically into \"A Feast for Crows\", Parts One and Two. Being already late with the book, Martin had not even started writing all characters' stories and also objected to ending the first book without any resolution for its many viewpoint characters as in previous books.\n\nWith the characters spread out across the world, a friend suggested that Martin divide the story geographically into two volumes, of which \"A Feast for Crows\" would be the first. This approach would give Martin the room to complete his commenced story arcs as he had originally intended, which he still felt was the best approach years later. Martin moved the unfinished characters' stories set in the east (Essos) and north (Winterfell and the Wall) into the next book, \"A Dance with Dragons\", and left \"A Feast for Crows\" to cover the events in King's Landing, the Riverlands, Dorne, and the Iron Islands. Both books begin immediately after the end of \"A Storm of Swords\", running in parallel instead of sequentially, and involve different casts of characters with only little overlap. Martin split Arya's chapters into both books after having already moved the three other most popular characters (Jon Snow, Tyrion, and Daenerys) into \"A Dance with Dragons\".\n\nUpon its release in October 2005 in the UK and November 2005 in the US, \"A Feast for Crows\" went straight to the top of \"The New York Times\" bestseller list. Among the positive reviewers was Lev Grossman of \"Time\", who dubbed Martin \"the American Tolkien\". However, fans and critics alike were disappointed with the story split that left the fates of several popular characters unresolved after \"A Storm of Swords\" cliffhanger ending. With \"A Dance with Dragons\" said to be half-finished, Martin mentioned in the epilogue of \"A Feast for Crows\" that the next volume would be released by the next year. However, planned release dates were repeatedly pushed back. Meanwhile, HBO acquired the rights to turn \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" into a dramatic series in 2007 and aired the first of ten episodes covering \"A Game of Thrones\" in April 2011.\n\nWith around 1600 pages in manuscript length, \"A Dance with Dragons\" was eventually published in July 2011 after six years of writing, longer in page count and writing time than any of the preceding four novels. The story of \"A Dance with Dragons\" catches up with and goes beyond \"A Feast for Crows\" around two-thirds into the book, but nevertheless covers less story than Martin had intended, omitting at least one planned large battle sequence and leaving several character threads ending in cliff-hangers. Martin attributed the delay mainly to his untangling \"the Meereenese knot\", which the interviewer understood as \"making the chronology and characters mesh up as various threads converged on [Daenerys]\". Martin also acknowledged spending too much time on rewriting and perfecting the story, but soundly rejected the theories of some of his critics that he had lost interest in the series or would bide his time to make more money.\n\nMartin believes the last two volumes of the series will be big books of 1500 manuscript pages each. The sixth book will be called \"The Winds of Winter\", taking the title of the last book of the originally planned trilogy. Displeased with the provisional title \"A Time for Wolves\" for the final volume, Martin ultimately announced \"A Dream of Spring\" as the title for the seventh book in 2006. Martin said in March 2012 that the final two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others will appear in the book.\n\n\"The Winds of Winter\" will resolve the cliffhangers from \"A Dance with Dragons\" early on and \"will open with the two big battles that [the fifth book] was building up to, the battle in the ice and the battle [...] of Slaver's Bay. And then take it from there.\" By the middle of 2010, Martin had already finished five chapters of \"The Winds of Winter\" from the viewpoints of Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Arianne Martell, and Aeron Greyjoy, coming to around 100 completed pages. After the publication of \"A Dance with Dragons\" in 2011, Martin announced he would return to writing in January 2012. He spent the meantime on book tours, conventions, and continued working on his \"The World of Ice & Fire\" companion guide and a new \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" novella.\n\nIn December 2011, Martin posted a chapter from \"The Winds of Winter\" from the viewpoint of Theon Greyjoy; several other chapters have been made public since. Four hundred pages of the sixth novel had been written , although Martin considered only 200 as \"really finished\"; the rest needed revising. In 2011, Martin gave three years as a realistic estimate for finishing the sixth book at a good pace, but said ultimately the book \"will be done when it's done\", acknowledging that his publication estimates had been too optimistic in the past. Martin did not intend to separate the characters geographically again.\n\nIn 2015 there were indications that the book would be published before the sixth season of the HBO show but in early January 2016 Martin confirmed that he had not met an end-of-year deadline that he had established with his publisher for release of the book before the sixth season. He also revealed there had been a previous deadline of October 2015 that he had considered achievable in May 2015, and that in September 2015 he had still considered the end-of-year deadline achievable. He further confirmed that some of the plot of the book might be revealed in the upcoming season of \"Game of Thrones\". In February 2016, Martin stated that he dropped all his editing projects except for \"Wild Cards\", and that he would not be writing any teleplays, screenplays, short stories, introductions or forewords before delivering \"The Winds of Winter\". In April 2018, Martin announced in a blog post that \"The Winds of Winter\" would not be published in 2018.\n\nDuring the Guadalajara International Book Fair in Mexico in early December 2016, Martin offered the following hint as to the tone of this book:There are a lot of dark chapters right now ... I've been telling you for 20 years that winter was coming. Winter is the time when things die, and cold and ice and darkness fill the world, so this is not going to be the happy feel-good that people may be hoping for. Some of the characters [are] in very dark places.\n\nMartin is firm about ending the series with the seventh novel \"until I decide not to be firm\". With his stated goal of telling the story from beginning to end, he will not truncate the story to fit into an arbitrary number of volumes. He knows the ending in broad strokes as well as the future of the main characters, and will finish the series with bittersweet elements where not everyone will live happily ever after. Martin hopes to write an ending similar to \"The Lord of the Rings\" that he felt gave the story a satisfying depth and resonance. On the other hand, Martin noted the challenge to avoid a situation like the finale of the TV series \"Lost\", which left some fans disappointed by deviating too far from their own theories and desires. In 2015, Martin said that he was not writing \"A Dream of Spring\" together with \"The Winds of Winter\", and in early 2016, he said he did not believe \"A Dream of Spring\" would be published before the last season of the HBO show. In 2018, Martin commented he had not started working on the book.\n\nMartin offered the following hint as to how the series would conclude during a Q&A at the Guadalajara International Book Fair. \"I'm not going to tell you how I'm going to end my book, but I suspect the overall flavor is going to be as much bittersweet as it is happy.\"\n\nEarly during the development of the TV series, Martin told major plot points to producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. (\"The New York Times\" reported in 2011 that, at age 62, Martin was by all accounts in robust health.) Martin was confident he would have published at least \"The Winds of Winter\" before the TV series overtook him. Nevertheless, there was general concern about whether Martin would be able to stay ahead of the show. As a result, head writers Benioff and Weiss learned more future plot points from Martin in 2013 to help them set up the show's new possible seasons. This included the end stories for all the core characters. Deviations from the books' storylines are also being considered, but a two-year show hiatus to wait for new books is not an option for them as the child actors continue to grow and the show's popularity would wane. Martin indicated he would not permit another writer to finish the book series. On January 2, 2016, Martin confirmed that the sixth volume would not be published before the start of the sixth season of the HBO series.\n\nRegarding \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" as his magnum opus, Martin is certain never to write anything on this scale again and would only return to this fictional universe in the context of stand-alone novels. He prefers to write stories about characters from other \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" periods of history such as his \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" project, instead of continuing the series directly. A possible future side project is a prequel set during Aegon's conquest of Westeros. Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a murder mystery. However, he will see if his audience follows him after publishing his next project.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin believes the most profound influences to be the ones experienced in childhood. Having read H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, Robert A. Heinlein, Eric Frank Russell, Andre Norton, Isaac Asimov, Fritz Leiber, and Mervyn Peake in his youth, Martin never categorized these authors' literature into science fiction, fantasy, or horror and will write from any genre as a result. Martin classified \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" as \"epic fantasy\", and specifically named Tad Williams' high fantasy epic \"Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn\" as very influential for the writing of the series. One of his favorite authors is Jack Vance, although Martin considered the series not particularly Vancean.\n\nMartin experienced some harsh winters when living in Dubuque a few years in the 70s, and suspects these winters had an influence on his writing; \"I think a lot of the stuff in A Game of Thrones, the snow and ice and freezing, comes from my memories of Dubuque\".\n\nThe medieval setting has been the traditional background for epic fantasy. However, where historical fiction leaves versed readers knowing the historical outcome, original characters may increase suspense and empathy for the readers. Yet Martin felt historical fiction, particularly when set during the Middle Ages, had an excitement, grittiness, and a realness to it that was absent in fantasy with a similar backdrop. Thus, he wanted to combine the realism of historical fiction with the magic appeal of the best fantasies, subduing magic in favor of battles and political intrigue. He also decided to avoid the conventional good versus evil setting typical for the genre, using the fight between Achilles and Hector in Homer's \"Iliad\", where no one stands out as either a hero or a villain, as an example of what he wants to achieve with his books.\n\nMartin is widely credited with broadening the fantasy fiction genre for adult content, including incest, paedophilia, and adultery. For \"The Washington Post\" Writing for \"The Atlantic\", Amber Taylor assessed the novels as hard fantasy with vulnerable characters to which readers become emotionally attached. CNN found in 2000 that Martin's mature descriptions were \"far more frank than those found in the works of other fantasy authors\", although Martin assessed the fantasy genre to have become rougher-edged a decade later and that some writers' work was going beyond the mature themes of his novels. Adam Roberts called Martin's series the most successful and popular example of the emerging subgenre of grimdark fantasy.\n\nSetting out to write something on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages in the very early stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write . Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. , Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10Â am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time. Martin does not consider \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" a \"series\" but a single story published in several volumes.\n\nMartin set the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" story in a secondary world inspired by Tolkien's writing. Unlike Tolkien, who created entire languages, mythologies, and histories for Middle-earth long before writing \"The Lord of the Rings\", Martin usually starts with a rough sketch of an imaginary world that he improvises into a workable fictional setting along the way. He described his writing as coming from a subconscious level in \"almost a daydreaming process\", and his stories, which have a mythic rather than a scientific core, draw from emotion instead of rationality. Martin employs maps and a cast list topping 60 pages in the fourth volume, but keeps most information in his mind. His imagined backstory remains subject to change until published, and only the novels count as canon. Martin does not intend to publish his private notes after the series is finished.\n\nMartin drew much inspiration from actual history for the series, having several bookcases filled with medieval history for research and visiting historic European landmarks. For an American who speaks only English, the history of England proved the easiest source of medieval history for him, giving the series a British rather than a German or Spanish historic flavor. For example, Ned and Robb Stark resemble Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and his son Edward IV, and Queen Cersei resembles both Margaret of Anjou and Elizabeth Woodville. Martin immersed himself in many diverse medieval topics such as clothing, food, feasting, and tournaments to have the facts at hand if needed during writing. The series was in particular influenced by the Hundred Years' War, the Crusades, the Albigensian Crusade, and the Wars of the Roses, although Martin refrained from making any direct adaptations. Martin was also inspired by the French historical novels \"The Accursed Kings\" by Maurice Druon, which are about the French monarchy in the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nThe story is written to follow principal landmarks with an ultimate destination, but leaves Martin room for improvisation. On occasion, improvised details significantly affected the planned story. By the fourth book, Martin kept more private notes than ever before to keep track of the many subplots, which became so detailed and sprawling by the fifth book as to be unwieldy. Martin's editors, copy editors, and readers monitor for accidental mistakes, although some errors have slipped into publication. For instance, Martin has inconsistently referred to certain characters' eye colors, and has described a horse as being of one sex and then another.\n\nThe books are divided into chapters, each one narrated in the third person limited through the eyes of a point of view character, an approach Martin learned himself as a young journalism student. Beginning with nine POV characters in \"A Game of Thrones\", the number of POV characters grows to a total of 31 in \"A Dance with Dragons\" (see table). The short-lived one-time POV characters are mostly restricted to the prologue and epilogue. David Orr of \"The New York Times\" noted the story importance of \"the Starks (good guys), the Targaryens (at least one good guy, or girl), the Lannisters (conniving), the Greyjoys (mostly conniving), the Baratheons (mixed bag), the Tyrells (unclear) and the Martells (ditto), most of whom are feverishly endeavoring to advance their ambitions and ruin their enemies, preferably unto death\". However, as \"Time\" Lev Grossman noted, readers \"experience the struggle for Westeros from all sides at once\", such that \"every fight is both triumph and tragedy [...] and everybody is both hero and villain at the same time\".\n\nModeled on \"The Lord of the Rings\", the story of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" begins with a tight focus on a small group (with everyone in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding the turning point in this complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin is said to have reached the turning point in \"A Dance with Dragons\", or to not quite have reached it yet in the books. The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by \"Wild Cards\", a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985. As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.\n\nInfluenced by his television and film scripting background, Martin tries to keep readers engrossed by ending each \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" chapter with a tense or revelational moment, a twist or a cliffhanger, similar to a TV act break. Scriptwriting has also taught him the technique of \"cutting out the fat and leaving the muscle\", which is the final stage of completing a book, a technique that brought the page count in \"A Dance with Dragons\" down almost eighty pages. Dividing the continuous \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" story into books is much harder for Martin. Each book shall represent a phase of the journey that ends in closure for most characters. A smaller portion of characters is left with clear-cut cliffhangers to make sure readers come back for the next installment, although \"A Dance with Dragons\" had more cliffhangers than Martin originally intended. Both one-time and regular POV characters are designed to have full character arcs ending in tragedy or triumph, and are written to hold the readers' interest and not be skipped in reading. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not rely on the hero to come through unscathed and will instead feel the character's fear with each page turn.\n\nThe unresolved larger narrative arc encourages speculation about future story events. According to Martin, much of the key to \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" future lies over a dozen years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more. Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is careful not to make the story predictable. The viewpoint characters, who serve as unreliable narrators, may clarify or provide different perspectives on past events. Therefore, what the readers believe to be true may not necessarily be true.\n\nRegarding the characters as the heart of the story, Martin planned the epic \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" to have a large cast of characters and many different settings from the beginning. \"A Feast for Crows\" has a 63-page list of characters, with many of the thousands of characters mentioned only in passing or disappearing from view for long stretches. When Martin adds a new family to the ever-growing number of genealogies in the appendices, he devises a secret about the personality or fate of the family members. However, their backstory remains subject to change until written down in the story. Martin drew most character inspiration from history (without directly translating historical figures) and his own experiences, but also from the manners of his friends, acquaintances, and people of public interest. Martin aims to \"make my characters real and to make them human, characters who have good and bad, noble and selfish well-mixed in their natures\". Jeff VanderMeer of the \"Los Angeles Times\" remarked that \"Martin's devotion to fully inhabiting his characters, for better or worse, creates the unstoppable momentum in his novels and contains an implied criticism of Tolkien's moral simplicity\" (see Themes: Moral ambiguity).\n\nMartin deliberately ignored the writing rule of never giving two characters names starting with the same letter. Instead, character names reflect the naming systems in various European family histories, where particular names were associated with specific royal houses and where even the secondary families assigned the same names repeatedly. The story of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" therefore has children called \"Robert\" in honor of King Robert of House Baratheon, a \"Brandon\" in every other generation of the Starks in commemoration of Brandon the Builder (of the Wall), and the syllable \"Ty\" commonly occurring in given names of House Lannister. Confident that readers would pay attention, Martin distinguished people sharing a given name by adding numbers or locations to their given names (e.g. Henry V of England). The family names were designed in association with ethnic groups (see backstory): the First Men in the North of Westeros had very simply descriptive names like Stark and Strong, whereas the descendants of the Andal invaders in the South have more elaborate, undescriptive house names like Lannister or Arryn, and the Targaryens and Valyrians from the Eastern continent have the most exotic names with the letter Y.\n\nAll characters are designed to speak with their own internal voices to capture their views of the world. \"The Atlantic\" pondered whether Martin ultimately intended the readers to sympathize with characters on both sides of the LannisterâStark feud long before plot developments force them to make their emotional choices. Contrary to most conventional epic fantasies, the characters of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" are vulnerable so that, according to \"The Atlantic\", the reader \"cannot be sure that good shall triumph, which makes those instances where it does all the more exulting.\" Martin gets emotionally involved in the characters' lives during writing, which makes the chapters with dreadful events sometimes very difficult to write. Seeing the world through the characters' eyes requires a certain amount of empathy with them, including the villains, all of whom he has said he loves as if they were his own children. Martin found that some characters had minds of their own and took his writing in different directions. He returns to the intended story if it does not work out, but these detours sometimes prove more rewarding for him.\n\nArya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen generate the most feedback from readers. Martin has stated that Tyrion is his personal favorite, as the grayest of the gray characters, with his cunning and wit making him the most fun to write. Martin has also said that Bran Stark is the hardest character to write. As the character most deeply involved in magic, Bran's story needs to be handled carefully within the supernatural aspects of the books. Bran is also the youngest viewpoint character, and has to deal with the series' adult themes like grief, loneliness, and anger. Martin set out to have the young characters grow up faster between chapters, but, as it was implausible for a character to take two months to respond, a finished book represents very little time passed. Martin hoped the planned five-year break would ease the situation and age the children to almost adults in terms of the Seven Kingdoms, but he later dropped the five-year gap (see section Bridging the timeline gap).\n\nAlthough modern fantasy may often embrace strangeness, \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.\n\nSince Martin drew on historical sources to build the world of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" , Damien G. Walter of \"The Guardian\" saw a strong resemblance between Westeros and England in the period of the Wars of the Roses. \"The Atlantic\" Adam Serwer regarded \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" as \"more a story of politics than one of heroism, a story about humanity wrestling with its baser obsessions than fulfilling its glorious potential\", where the emergent power struggle stems from the feudal system's repression and not from the fight between good and evil. Martin not only wanted to reflect the frictions of the medieval class structures in the novels, but also explore the consequences of the leaders' decisions, as general goodness does not automatically make competent leaders and vice versa.\n\nA common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not mirroring the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.\n\nAlthough fantasy comes from an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest necessity to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.\n\nAccording to Martin, the fantasy genre rarely focuses on sex and sexuality, instead often treating sexuality in a juvenile way or neglecting it completely. Martin, however, considers sexuality an important driving force in human life that should not be excluded from the narrative. Providing sensory detail for an immersive experience is more important than plot advancement for Martin, who aims to let the readers experience the novels' sex scenes, \"whether it's a great transcendent, exciting, mind blowing sex, or whether it's disturbing, twisted, dark sex, or disappointing perfunctory sex.\" Martin was fascinated by medieval contrasts where knights venerated their ladies with poems and wore their favors in tournaments while their armies mindlessly raped women in wartime. The non-existent concept of adolescence in the Middle Ages served as a model for Daenerys' sexual activity at the age of 13 in the books. The novels also allude to the incestuous practices in the Ptolemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt to keep their bloodlines pure.\n\nMartin provides a variety of female characters to explore the place of women in a patriarchal society. Writing all characters as human beings with the same basic needs, dreams, and influences, his female characters are to cover the same wide spectrum of human traits as the males.\n\n\"Science Fiction Weekly\" stated in 2000 that \"few would dispute that Martin's most monumental achievement to date has been the groundbreaking \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" historical fantasy series\", for which reviews have been \"orders of magnitude better\" than for his previous works, as Martin described to \"The New Yorker\". In 2007, \"Weird Tales\" magazine described the series as a \"superb fantasy saga\" that \"raised Martin to a whole new level of success\". Shortly before the release of \"A Dance with Dragons\" in 2011, Bill Sheehan of \"The Washington Post\" was sure that \"no work of fantasy has generated such anticipation since Harry Potter's final duel with Voldemort\", and Ethan Sacks of \"Daily News\" saw the series turning Martin into a darling of literary critics as well as mainstream readers, which was \"rare for a fantasy genre that's often dismissed as garbage not fit to line the bottom of a dragon's cage\". Salon.com's Andrew Leonard stated:The success is all the more remarkable because [the series debuted] without mass market publicity or any kind of buzz in the fantasy/SF scene. George R. R. Martin earned his following the hard way, by word of mouth, by hooking his characters into the psyche of his readers to an extent that most writers of fantasy only dream of.\"Publishers Weekly\" noted in 2000 that \"Martin may not rival Tolkien or Robert Jordan, but he ranks with such accomplished medievalists of fantasy as Poul Anderson and Gordon Dickson.\" After the fourth volume came out in 2005, \"Time\" Lev Grossman considered Martin a \"major force for evolution in fantasy\" and proclaimed him \"the American Tolkien\", explaining that, although Martin was \"[not] the best known of America's straight-up fantasy writers\" at the time and would \"never win a Pulitzer or a National Book AwardÂ ... his skill as a crafter of narrative exceeds that of almost any literary novelist writing today\". As Grossman said in 2011, the phrase \"American Tolkien\" \"has stuck to [Martin], as it was meant to\", being picked up by the media including \"The New York Times\" (\"He's much better than that\"), the \"New Yorker\", \"Entertainment Weekly\" (\"an acclaim that borders on fantasy blasphemy\"), \"The Globe and Mail\", and \"USA Today\". \"Time\" magazine named Martin one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and \"USA Today\" named George R.R. Martin their Author of the Year 2011.\n\nAccording to \"The Globe and Mail\" John Barber, Martin manages simultaneously to master and transcend the genre so that \"Critics applaud the depth of his characterizations and lack of clichÃ© in books that are nonetheless replete with dwarves and dragons\". \"Publishers Weekly\" gave favorable reviews to the first three \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" novels at their points of release, saying that \"A Game of Thrones\" had \"superbly developed characters, accomplished prose and sheer bloody-mindedness\", that \"A Clash of Kings\" was \"notable particularly for the lived-in quality of [their fictional world and] for the comparatively modest role of magic\", and that \"A Storm of Swords\" was one \"of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy\". However, they found that \"A Feast For Crows\" as the fourth installment \"sorely misses its other half. The slim pickings here are tasty, but in no way satisfying.\" Their review for \"A Dance with Dragons\" repeated points of criticism for the fourth volume, and said that, although \"The new volume has a similar feel to \"Feast\"\", \"Martin keeps it fresh by focusing on popular characters [who were] notably absent from the previous book.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Martin's brilliance in evoking atmosphere through description is an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings much more than just props on a painted stage\", and the novels captivate readers with \"complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters\". CNN remarked that \"the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style\", and David Orr of \"The New York Times\" found that \"All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles.\" Salon.com's Andrew Leonard \"couldn't stop reading Martin because my desire to know what was going to happen combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted.\" \"The Christian Science Monitor\" advised reading the novels with an \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" encyclopedia at hand to \"catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [Martin] leaves throughout his books. If you pay attention, you will be rewarded and questions will be answered.\"\n\nAmong the most critical voices were Sam Jordison and Michael Hann, both of \"The Guardian\". Jordison detailed his misgivings about \"A Game of Thrones\" in a 2009 review and summarized \"It's daft. It's unsophisticated. It's cartoonish. And yet, I couldn't stop readingÂ ... Archaic absurdity aside, Martin's writing is excellent. His dialogue is snappy and frequently funny. His descriptive prose is immediate and atmospheric, especially when it comes to building a sense of deliciously dark foreboding [of the long impending winter].\" Hann did not consider the novels to stand out from the general fantasy genre, despite Martin's alterations to fantasy convention, although he rediscovered his childhood's views:That when things are, on the whole, pretty crappy [in the real world], it's a deep joy to dive headfirst into something so completely immersive, something from which there is no need to surface from hours at a time. And if that immersion involves dragons, magic, wraiths from beyond death, shapeshifting wolves and banished princes, so be it.\n\nThe reported overall sales figures of the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series vary. \"The New Yorker\" said in April 2011 (before the publication of \"A Dance with Dragons\") that more than 15Â million \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" books had been sold worldwide, a figure repeated by \"The Globe and Mail\" in July 2011. Reuters reported in September 2013 that the books including print, digital and audio versions have sold more than 24Â million copies in North America. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported more than six million sold copies in North America by May 2011. \"USA Today\" reported 8.5Â million copies in print and digital overall in July 2011, and over 12Â million sold copies in print in December 2011. The series has been translated into more than 20 languages; \"USA Today\" reported the fifth book to be translated into over 40 languages. \"Forbes\" estimated that Martin was the 12th highest-earning author worldwide in 2011 at $15Â million.\n\nMartin's publishers initially expected \"A Game of Thrones\" to be a best-seller, but the first installment did not even reach any lower positions in bestseller list. This left Martin unsurprised, as it is \"a fool's game to think anything is going to be successful or to count on it\". However, the book slowly won the passionate advocacy of independent booksellers and the book's popularity grew by word of mouth. The series' popularity skyrocketed in subsequent volumes, with the second and third volume making \"The New York Times\" Best Seller lists in 1999 and 2000, respectively. The series gained Martin's old writings new attention, and Martin's American publisher Bantam Spectra was to reprint his out-of-print solo novels.\n\nThe fourth installment, \"A Feast for Crows\", was an immediate best-seller at its 2005 release, hitting number one on \"The New York Times\" hardcover fiction bestseller list November 27, 2005, which for a fantasy novel suggested that Martin's books were attracting mainstream readers. The paperback edition of \"A Game of Thrones\" reached its 34th printing in 2010, surpassing the one million mark. Before it even premiered, the TV series had boosted sales of the book series, with \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" approaching triple-digit growth in year-on-year sales. Bantam was looking forward to seeing the tie-ins boost sales further, and Martin's British publisher Harper Voyager expected readers to rediscover their other epic fantasy literature. With a reported 4.5Â million copies of the first four volumes in print in early 2011, the four volumes re-appeared on the paperback fiction bestseller lists in the second quarter of 2011.\n\nAt its point of publication in July 2011, \"A Dance with Dragons\" was in its sixth print with more than 650,000 hardbacks in print. It also had the highest single and first-day sales of any new fiction title published in 2011 at that point, with 170,000 hardcovers, 110,000 e-books, and 18,000 audio books reportedly sold on the first day. \"A Dance with Dragons\" reached the top of \"The New York Times\" bestseller list on July 31, 2011. Unlike most other big titles, the fifth volume sold more physical than digital copies early on, but nevertheless, Martin became the tenth author to sell 1Â million Amazon Kindle e-books. All five volumes and the four-volume boxed set were among the top 100 best-selling books in the United States in 2011 and 2012.\n\nThe TV series has contributed significantly boosting sales of both the books and collectibles like box-sets, merchandise, and other items. The TV series also contributed in increasing the geographic coverage of the books, introducing new customers in emerging countries like India and Brazil to the book series. All this has significantly increased the overall book sales.\n\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, Martin's novels had slowly earned him a reputation in science fiction circles, although he said to only have received a few fans' letters a year in the pre-internet days. The publication of \"A Game of Thrones\" caused Martin's following to grow, with fan sites springing up and a Trekkie-like society of followers evolving that meet regularly. Westeros.org, one of the main \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" fansites with about seventeen thousand registered members , was established in 1999 by a Swedish-based fan of Cuban-American descent, Elio M. GarcÃ­a, Jr., and his girlfriend; their involvement with Martin's work has now become semi-professional. The Brotherhood Without Banners, an unofficial fan club operating globally, was formed in 2001. Their founders and other longtime members are among Martin's good friends.\n\nMartin runs an official website and administers a lively blog with the assistance of Ty Franck. He also interacts with fandom by answering emails and letters, although he stated in 2005 that their sheer numbers might leave them unanswered for years. Since there are different types of conventions nowadays, he tends to go to three or four science-fiction conventions a year simply to go back to his roots and meet friends. He does not read message boards anymore, so that his writing will not be influenced by fans foreseeing twists and interpreting characters differently from what he intended.\n\nWhile Martin calls the majority of his fans \"great\", and enjoys interacting with them, some of them turned against him because of the six years it took to release \"A Dance with Dragons\". A movement of disaffected fans called GRRuMblers formed in 2009, creating sites such as \"Finish the Book, George\" and \"Is Winter Coming?\" When fans' vocal impatience for \"A Dance with Dragons\" peaked shortly after, Martin issued a statement called \"To My Detractors\" on his blog that received media attention. \"The New York Times\" noted that it was not uncommon for Martin to be mobbed at book signings either. \"The New Yorker\" called this \"an astonishing amount of effort to devote to denouncing the author of books one professes to love. Few contemporary authors can claim to have inspired such passion.\"\n\n\nMartin has written several prequel novellas. The \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" series, three novellas set ninety years before the events of the novel series, feature the adventures of Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire \"Egg\", the later King Aegon V Targaryen. The stories have no direct connection to the plot of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", although both characters are mentioned in \"A Storm of Swords\" and \"A Feast For Crows\", respectively. The first installment, \"The Hedge Knight\", was published in the 1998 anthology \"Legends\". \"The Sworn Sword\" followed in 2003, published in \"Legends II\". Both were later adapted into graphic novels. The third novella, titled \"The Mystery Knight\", was first published in the 2010 anthology \"Warriors\", and is planned to be adapted as a graphic novel as well. In 2015 the first three novellas were published as one collection, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\".\n\nThe novella \"The Princess and the Queen or, the Blacks and the Greens\" appeared in Tor Books's 2013 anthology \"Dangerous Women\", and explains some of the Targaryen backstory two centuries before the events of the novels. \"The Rogue Prince, or, the King's Brother\", published in the 2014 anthology \"Rogues\", is itself a prequel to the events of \"The Princess and the Queen\". The novella \"The Sons of the Dragon\" appeared in the 2017 anthology \"The Book of Swords\", is the story of Aegon the Conqueror's two sons Aenys I and Maegor I \"the cruel\".\n\nChapter sets from the novels were also compiled into three novellas that were released between 1996 and 2003 by \"Asimov's Science Fiction\" and \"Dragon\":\n\nWith the popularity of the series growing, HBO optioned \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" for a television adaptation in 2007. A pilot episode was produced in late 2009, and a series commitment for nine further episodes was made in March 2010. The series, titled \"Game of Thrones\", premiered in April 2011 to great acclaim and ratings (see \"Game of Thrones\": Reception). The network picked up the show for a second season covering \"A Clash of Kings\" two days later. Shortly after the conclusion of the first season, the show received 13 Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series, winning Outstanding Main Title Design and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for Peter Dinklage's portrayal of Tyrion Lannister. HBO announced a renewal for a third season in April 2012, ten days after the season 2 premiere. Due to the length of the corresponding book, the third season only covered roughly the first half of \"A Storm of Swords\".\n\nShortly after the season 3 premiere in March 2013, the network announced that \"Game of Thrones\" would be returning for a fourth season, which would cover the second half of \"A Storm of Swords \"along with the beginnings of \"A Feast for Crows \"and \"A Dance With Dragons\". \"Game of Thrones\" was nominated for 15 Emmy Awards for season 3. Two days after the fourth season premiered in April 2014, HBO renewed \"Game of Thrones\" for a fifth and sixth season. Season 5 premiered on April 12, 2015 and set a Guinness World Records for winning the highest number of Emmy Awards for a series in a single season and year, winning 12 out of 24 nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series.\nThese episodes were watched by 8Â million viewers, setting a record number for the series. The sixth season premiered on April 24, 2016. These episodes received the most nominations for the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards with 23, winning 12, including the award for Outstanding Drama Series. The seventh season premiered on July 16, 2017. The eighth and final season is set to premiere in April 2019.\n\n\"A Song of Ice and Fire\" has spawned an industry of spin-off products. Fantasy Flight Games released a collectible card game, a board game, and two collections of artwork inspired by \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series. Various roleplaying game products were released by Guardians of Order and Green Ronin. Dynamite Entertainment adapted \"A Game of Thrones\" into a same-titled monthly comic in 2011. Several video games are available or in production, including \"\" (2011) and \"Game of Thrones\" (2012) by Cyanide; both received mediocre ratings from critics. A social network game titled \"Game of Thrones Ascent\" (2013) by Disruptor Beam allows players to live the life of a noble during the series' period setting. Random House released an official map book called \"The Lands of Ice and Fire\", which includes old and new maps of the \"Ice and Fire\" world. The companion book \"The World of Ice & Fire\" by Martin and the Westeros.org owners Elio M. GarcÃ­a Jr. and Linda Antonsson was published in October 2014. Other licensed products include full-sized weapon reproductions, a range of collectable figures, Westeros coinage reproductions, and a large number of gift and collectible items based on the HBO television series. The popularity of the HBO series has made its version of the Iron Throne an icon of the entire media franchise.\n\n\n"}

The painting dates from about 1640, and is relatively unusual as a religious subject or history painting in their \"oeuvre\"; they are best known for genre painting, especially groups of peasants. As with most of the works of Antoine (c 1600â1648), Louis (c. 1603?â1648) and Mathieu (1607â1677) Le Nain, it is not possible to establish which brother, or combination of brothers, painted it. This painting is unsigned, but when they signed their works, from 1641 to 1648, it was simply as \"Lenain\".\n\nThe painting is in oil on canvas and in good condition, with minor losses; it measures . The \"Adoration of the Shepherds\" is a very common subject in the Nativity of Jesus in art, and the composition is an arrangement of the conventional components, including the Holy Family, the ox and ass or donkey, angels, and three shepherds, two old and one young. One shepherd and an angel are glancing out to the viewer's left, and it has been suggested that they have seen the approach of the Biblical Magi, which may have been the subject of a matching painting. There are \"pentimenti\" showing what appears to have been the original composition: on the wall above the lefthand angel dim traces of a head of the Virgin can be seen, slightly bowed to the left matching Joseph just to her right. On the donkey the trace of a curved rein can be seen, starting where the white chest meets the foreleg; the whole animal may originally have been lower. Michael Levey describes the treatment of the scene as \"partly 'realistic' and humbly rustic and partly idealized\", and the National Gallery detect the influence of Orazio Gentileschi, who had worked in Paris, in the figures of Mary and Joseph, and the ass.\n\nDates in the 1630s have been suggested, and also that the painting is by Mathieu, or Louis. Elements of the architectural setting have been compared to those in a painting by Laurent de La Hyre in the Hermitage Museum dated 1638, \"Mercury confiding Bacchus to the Nymphs\" (in reverse), and the ass is very similar to that in \"The Milkmaid's Family\", also in the Hermitage, a Le Nain painting thought to date to 1641. There is an \"Adoration\" attributed to the brothers, and at least in a similar style, in the National Gallery of Ireland, which shares some aspects of the composition. Another, more realist, \"Adoration of the Shepherds\" in the Louvre was long attributed to the Le Nains, but is now given to Jean Michelin and dated 1659.\n\nAs with most Le Nain paintings, the original commissioner is not known, nor whether it was intended for a church or other religious institution, or a domestic setting. It first appears in England in the 1770s. Possibly it was the painting of the subject sold at Christie's 7 February 1771, as by Le Nain (lot 21), realizing the good price of Â£42, and/or that sold on 20 March 1773, again at Christie's, this time for only Â£14 4s 6d (lot 85, as \"Le Naine\"). It was certainly at Blenheim Palace by 1777, now attributed to Luca Giordano, in the collection of George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough. It remained in the Marlborough collection until the epic sales in the 1880s of the 8th Duke, when it was once again sold at Christie's on 7 August 1886 (lot 652, Â£52 10s), bought by a dealer. It was later bought by Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk and is recorded as hanging in the \"Prince's Bedroom\" at Arundel Castle in 1902, still as a Giordano. In 1962 it was sold by the 16th Duke to the National Gallery, as a Le Nain. It is catalogued as NG 6331, and hangs in Room 18.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58455575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58455575", "title": "Ancient Cypriot art", "text": "Ancient Cypriot art\n\nAncient Cypriot art refers to all works of visual art originating from Cyprus in the Eastern Mediterranean from c. 10,000 BC to c. 330 AD. During this period, various types of objects were produced such as domestic tools, weaponry, jewellery, and decorative figurines. This range of art attests to the blend of both native and foreign influences of ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome as they successively occupied the country. Artworks produced in ancient Cyprus incorporate almost all of the mediums of visual art worked on in ancient history including terracotta, stone, metals, glass, and gemstones.\n\nIn c. 10,000 BC, seasonal hunters of pygmy hippopotami and elephants were present on the island. The first Neolithic settlers in Cyprus originated from either the Syro-Palestinian coast or southern Anatolia, forming communities founded on agriculture. It was towards the end of the Neolithic period when people began to bake moulded clay into vessels which were frequently embellished with abstract designs in red on a light slip.\n\nDuring this period, a new flood of Syro-Palestinian and Anatolian migrants introduced a more advanced culture where religion was practised and art processes became more complex. Examples of such art are that of female figurines formed from clay or stoneâin particular the local stone picroliteâwith prominent genitals which represented fertility as one of the crucial values of agrarian society at the time. Towards the end of this period, small implements and ornamental decorations began to be hammered from copper, \"chalkos\" in Greek, hence giving the name of this era of progression from the Neolithic Period to the Bronze Age. Despite the continuation of agriculture, certain developments such as diversified burial procedures, the building of unique religious installations, and the use of seals indicate a more sophisticated and organised society.\n\nProfound changes caused by incoming coastal Asia Minor migrants and other intra-societal processes marked the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. Communities began to move, settling in areas of fertile land near sources of water. Influences from the Near East, where metallurgy was highly developed, established standardised procedures of mining, extracting, and smelting of the rich copper ores found in Cyprus. This resource would become a valued export of high demand throughout Mediterranean antiquity during the Middle Bronze Age. Although Cypriot society was still rooted in agriculture, bronze-smiths began to manufacture unique ornaments and tools following personal techniques towards the end of Early Bronze Age.\n\nThe distinctive geographical location of Cyprus in the centre of Eastern Mediterranean maritime trade allowed for the country to become a significant commercial hub. This advantage also provided the country the ability to build contacts with Egypt, the Near East, Minoan Crete, and Mycenaean Greece. However, despite progressive social organisation, the profound distinctions in wealth as evidenced in burials highlight the explicit social divisions at the time. Such divide and local disputes resulted in the construction of fortifications in many settlements.\n\nThe shapes and designs of pottery produced in the Early and Middle Bronze Ages were innovative and creative. Terracotta was used extensively to produce statuettes for tomb burials. Other burial items, particularly those for men, consisted of bronze weaponry and tools. Cylinder seals and use of gold and silver for jewellery were gradually popularised as well. With the increasing need for more complex ways of expressing religion, ceremonial sites and unique metalworks were constructed. Such constructions give evidence of the growing significance of metals like copper in Cyprus. By the end of the Bronze Age, Near Eastern and Aegean influences allowed for Cyprus to develop the art of engraving and carving to a large extent.\n\nDuring the Late Bronze Age, Cyprus was producing copper on a colossal scale and exporting it throughout the entire Eastern Mediterranean to be bartered for commodities and luxury goods. Various works of alabaster and faience, displayed within The Cesnola Collection, were imported from Egypt during the first half of the 14th century BC. The recent archaeological discovery off the Anatolian coast of ten tonnes of copper in a 14th century BC shipwreck at Ulu Burun show the large scope of Cyprusâ seafaring commerce. Jars holding Cypriot pottery and products of agriculture such as coriander were also found in the excavation.\n\nBy the Late Bronze Age, Cypriot art could be seen as a mixture of both domestic pressures and foreign influences. Adaptations of foreign stylistic elements from the Aegean, the Near East, and Egypt led to their reinterpretation and as a result incorporation into unique Cypriot customs. Particularly during the 12th century BC, bronze-work, writing, jewellery, and stone seal carvings were all influenced by the Aegean. From c. 1500 BC, Cypriots commenced using an undecipherable Cypro-Minoan script adopted from Crete which gave them the means to manage records and inventories at a time when social organisation was becoming increasingly complex. This script can be seen on clay tablets and records found in metropolitan cities such as Enkomi and Kalavasos. The Cesnola Collection also contains numerous vases on which some characters of this ancient script is visible. Upon excavations of rich burial grounds and 14th to 13th century BC urban centres like Enkomi, luxurious artefacts made from a range of materials have been discovered. Burial chambers of an elite class have further unearthed nearly exclusively a collection of imported Mycenaean vessels from the 14th century.\n\nWhile the arts in Cyprus thrived, social inequities arose as a result of the flux of imported wealth and resources. During the latter part of the 13th century BC, unrest took over Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean, leaving cities in ruins and generating a surge of Aegean refugees to Cyprus. However, despite the turmoil, Cyprus managed to eventually recover its economic and commercial success.\n\nAfter its recuperation, new settlements arose in Cyprus as a result of the influx of Greek and Achaean immigrants who brought with them their Mycenaean culture in the forms of pottery, clothing, weaponry, burial customs, and the Greek language. The country maintained its role as a main exporter of raw materials in the Mediterranean, and eventually introduced a new local syllabic script in the 11th century BC which was in use until the 3rd century BC for the writing of ancient Greek and Cypriot language. The establishment of a Phoenician settlement at Kition on the southern coast in around 900 BC further pushed Cyprusâ trade as the Phoenicians were interested in the plentiful copper and wood resources for shipbuilding. With this, the Phoenician language was adopted, and foreign ideas such as the cult of the goddess Astarte were assimilated into Cypriot culture. However, despite such imported customs at the time, Cypriot art managed to maintain its native characteristics. Pottery of this period was generally produced from Proto-White Painted Ware, but the Cypriots also painted in black and red. Advancements in the political structure of society could be seen in the founding of ten kingdoms ruled by kings called \"wanaktes\", as evidenced in a 7th century BC inscription. \n\nEvidence revealing the surrender of the Cypriot rulers to Assyria in 709 BC was found on a stele at Kition, and the kingdoms remained under Assyrian rule until 669 BC. Prosperity and cultural incitement in the kingdoms followed, and the kings of Cyprus were able to self-rule as long as they paid frequent tribute to the king of Assyria. The riches and foreign relations of these Cypriot kings can be seen in evidence found in royal burial chambers at Salamis. In 669 BC, Cyprus became independent, a rare circumstance in Cypriot history that lasted until the country was subjugated by Egypt under Amasis II in 560 BC. During this time, the extent of Egyptian control was evident in the increasing use of Egyptian symbols in Cypriot art, such as the head of Hathor which was found commonly on art pieces from Amathus. It could also be seen in the many stone sculptures of male votaries. Cypriot sculpture in the Cypro-Archaic Period was characterised by polychrome decoration which was also used in Greece. Terracotta during this time was often painted, and the development of the mould meant that figurine production could be accelerated to a great extent. In 545 BC, Cyprus was conquered by Cyrus the Great of Persia, but allied with the Ionian Greeks in 499 BC in attempt to rebel against the Persian invaders. Undeterred by the fluctuations in power, Cyprus remained prosperous as a pivotal trade hub, and religious practices did not change with new rule.\nUntil Cyprus was liberated by Alexander the Great in 333 BC, there was a constant power struggle for Cypriot independence against the Persians. During the Cypro-Classical era, sculptures, jewellery, clothing, and other art forms began to take on many Hellenic elements as a result of increased affiliation with the Greeks who aided the Cypriots in their attempts to depose the Persians. Sculptures in this period were generally made from terracotta or limestone and could only be afforded by the affluent. Although the influence of Greek culture was evident in the arts of Cyprus, the Cypriots still kept and used their own artistic styles. One prominent example is that of a Golgoi sarcophagus adorned with warriors in battle which is a scene commonly seen in Greek art. However, the Cypriot artist combines a hunting scene with this landscape, whereby the proportions of the animals are clearly distinctive from those found in Hellenic works. Similarly, Cypriot jewellery, in particular those made from gold, reveal a combination of both local and Greek artistic styles. East Greek influences from the sixth century BC gave rise to freestanding Cypriot sculptures that exhibited common Hellenic features such as the subtle smile and forward left foot.\n\nArt in Cyprus eventually came to assimilate Hellenistic elements as the Ptolemies conquered the country in 300 BC. Although artistic elements of ancient Athens influenced Cypriot burial architecture and other art forms in the beginning, Egyptian styles ultimately superseded. After the Romans seized control in 58 BC, Cyprus once again became a vibrant trading centre. Eastern Mediterranean traders and artists, including sculptors, brought with them a range of foreign artistic practices as they entered the country. As marble and bronze sculptures were increasingly imported from the Aegean, traditional limestone sculptures started to diminish. Hellenistic elements were still prevalent in Cypriot sculpture, ceramics and jewellery during this time. Ultimately, all forms of Cypriot art became influenced by Roman techniques and styles.\n\nOutside Cyprus, there are large collections in several museums, notably the British Museum and Louvre. One of the most extensive collections of ancient Cypriot art is The Cesnola Collection which is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. This inventory was amassed through personal investments and excavations by Luigi Palma di Cesnola who was an American consul based in Cyprus in 1865, before becoming the first director of the Metropolitan.\n\n"}

{"id": "4630125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4630125", "title": "Artificial cell", "text": "Artificial cell\n\nAn artificial cell or minimal cell is an engineered particle that mimics one or many functions of a biological cell. The term does not refer to a specific physical entity, but rather to the idea that certain functions or structures of biological cells can be replaced or supplemented with a synthetic entity. Often, artificial cells are biological or polymeric membranes which enclose biologically active materials. As such, nanoparticles, liposomes, polymersomes, microcapsules and a number of other particles have qualified as artificial cells. Micro-encapsulation allows for metabolism within the membrane, exchange of small molecules and prevention of passage of large substances across it. The main advantages of encapsulation include improved mimicry in the body, increased solubility of the cargo and decreased immune responses. Notably, artificial cells have been clinically successful in hemoperfusion.\n\nIn the area of synthetic biology, a \"living\" artificial cell has been defined as a completely synthetically made cell that can capture energy, maintain ion gradients, contain macromolecules as well as store information and have the ability to mutate. Such a cell is not technically feasible yet, but a variation of an artificial cell has been created in which a completely synthetic genome was introduced to genomically emptied host cells. Although not completely artificial because the cytoplasmic components as well as the membrane from the host cell are kept, the engineered cell is under control of a synthetic genome and is able to replicate.\n\nThe first artificial cells were developed by Thomas Chang at McGill University in the 1960s. These cells consisted of ultrathin membranes of nylon, collodion or crosslinked protein whose semipermeable properties allowed diffusion of small molecules in and out of the cell. These cells were micron-sized and contained cell, enzymes, hemoglobin, magnetic materials, adsorbents and proteins.\n\nLater artificial cells have ranged from hundred-micrometer to nanometer dimensions and can carry microorganisms, vaccines, genes, drugs, hormones and peptides. The first clinical use of artificial cells was in hemoperfusion by the encapsulation of activated charcoal.\n\nIn the 1970s, researchers were able to introduce enzymes, proteins and hormones to biodegradable microcapsules, later leading to clinical use in diseases such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Although Chang's initial research focused on artificial red blood cells, only in the mid-1990s were biodegradable artificial red blood cells developed. Artificial cells in biological cell encapsulation were first used in the clinic in 1994 for treatment in a diabetic patient and since then other types of cells such as hepatocytes, adult stem cells and genetically engineered cells have been encapsulated and are under study for use in tissue regeneration.\n\nOn December 29, 2011, chemists at Harvard University reported the creation of an artificial cell membrane.\n\nBy 2014, self-replicating, synthetic bacterial cells with cell walls and synthetic DNA had been produced. In January of that year researchers produced an artificial eukaryotic cell capable of undertaking multiple chemical reactions through working organelles.\n\nIn September 2018, researchers at the University of California developed artificial cells that can kill bacteria.Â The cells were engineered from the bottom-up â like Lego blocks â to destroy bacteria.\n\nMembranes for artificial cells be made of simple polymers, crosslinked proteins, lipid membranes or polymer-lipid complexes. Further, membranes can be engineered to present surface proteins such as albumin, antigens, Na/K-ATPase carriers, or pores such as ion channels.\nCommonly used materials for the production of membranes include hydrogel polymers such as alginate, cellulose and thermoplastic polymers such as hydroxyethyl methacrylate-methyl methacrylate (HEMA- MMA), polyacrylonitrile-polyvinyl chloride (PAN-PVC), as well as variations of the above-mentioned. The material used determines the permeability of the cell membrane, which for polymer depends on the molecular weight cut off (MWCO). The MWCO is the maximum molecular weight of a molecule that may freely pass through the pores and is important in determining adequate diffusion of nutrients, waste and other critical molecules.\nHydrophilic polymers have the potential to be biocompatible and can be fabricated into a variety of forms which include polymer micelles, sol-gel mixtures, physical blends and crosslinked particles and nanoparticles. Of special interest are stimuli-responsive polymers that respond to pH or temperature changes for the use in targeted delivery. These polymers may be administered in the liquid form through a macroscopic injection and solidify or gel \"in situ\" because of the difference in pH or temperature. Nanoparticle and liposome preparations are also routinely used for material encapsulation and delivery. A major advantage of liposomes is their ability to fuse to cell and organelle membranes.\n\nMany variations for artificial cell preparation and encapsulation have been developed. Typically, vesicles such as a nanoparticle, polymersome or liposome are synthesized. An emulsion is typically made through the use of high pressure equipment such as a high pressure homogenizer or a Microfluidizer. Two micro-encapsulation methods for nitrocellulose are also described below.\n\nIn a high-pressure homogenizer, two liquids in oil/liquid suspension are forced through a small orifice under very high pressure. This process divides the products and allows the creation of extremely fine particles, as small as 1Â nm.\n\nThis technique uses a patented Microfluidizer to obtain a greater amount of homogenous suspensions that can create smaller particles than homogenizers. A homogenizer is first used to create a coarse suspension which is then pumped into the microfluidizer under high pressure. The flow is then split into two streams which will react at very high velocities in an interaction chamber until desired particle size is obtained. This technique allows for large scale production of phospholipid liposomes and subsequent material nanoencapsulations.\n\nIn this method, a cell solution is incorporated dropwise into a collodion solution of cellulose nitrate. As the drop travels through the collodion, it is coated with a membrane thanks to the interfacial polymerization properties of the collodion. The cell later settles into paraffin where the membrane sets and is finally suspended a saline solution. The drop method is used for the creation of large artificial cells which encapsulate biological cells, stem cells and genetically engineered stem cells.\n\nThe emulsion method differs in that the material to be encapsulated is usually smaller and is placed in the bottom of a reaction chamber where the collodion is added on top and centrifuged, or otherwise disturbed in order to create an emulsion. The encapsulated material is then dispersed and suspended in saline solution.\n\nArtificial cells used for drug delivery differ from other artificial cells since their contents are intended to diffuse out of the membrane, or be engulfed and digested by a host target cell. Often used are submicron, lipid membrane artificial cells that may be referred to as nanocapsules, nanoparticles, polymersomes, or other variations of the term.\n\nEnzyme therapy is being actively studied for genetic metabolic diseases where an enzyme is over-expressed, under-expressed, defective, or not at all there. In the case of under-expression or expression of a defective enzyme, an active form of the enzyme is introduced in the body to compensate for the deficit. On the other hand, an enzymatic over-expression may be counteracted by introduction of a competing non-functional enzyme; that is, an enzyme which metabolizes the substrate into non-active products. When placed within an artificial cell, enzymes can carry out their function for a much longer period compared to free enzymes and can be further optimized by polymer conjugation.\n\nThe first enzyme studied under artificial cell encapsulation was asparaginase for the treatment of lymphosarcoma in mice. This treatment delayed the onset and growth of the tumor. These initial findings led to further research in the use of artificial cells for enzyme delivery in tyrosine dependent melanomas. These tumors have a higher dependency on tyrosine than normal cells for growth, and research has shown that lowering systemic levels of tyrosine in mice can inhibit growth of melanomas. The use of artificial cells in the delivery of tyrosinase; and enzyme that digests tyrosine, allows for better enzyme stability and is shown effective in the removal of tyrosine without the severe side-effects associated with tyrosine depravation in the diet.\n\nArtificial cell enzyme therapy is also of interest for the activation of prodrugs such as ifosfamide in certain cancers. Artificial cells encapsulating the cytochrome p450 enzyme which converts this prodrug into the active drug can be tailored to accumulate in the pancreatic carcinoma or implanting the artificial cells close to the tumor site. Here, the local concentration of the activated ifosfamide will be much higher than in the rest of the body thus preventing systemic toxicity. The treatment was successful in animals and showed a doubling in median survivals amongst patients with advanced-stage pancreatic cancer in phase I/II clinical trials, and a tripling in one-year survival rate.\n\nIn treatment of genetic diseases, gene therapy aims to insert, alter or remove genes within an afflicted individual's cells. The technology relies heavily on viral vectors which raises concerns about insertional mutagenesis and systemic immune response that have led to human deaths and development of leukemia in clinical trials. Circumventing the need for vectors by using naked or plasmid DNA as its own delivery system also encounters problems such as low transduction efficiency and poor tissue targeting when given systemically.\n\nArtificial cells have been proposed as a non-viral vector by which genetically modified non-autologous cells are encapsulated and implanted to deliver recombinant proteins \"in vivo\". This type of immuno-isolation has been proven efficient in mice through delivery of artificial cells containing mouse growth hormone which rescued a growth-retardation in mutant mice. A few strategies have advanced to human clinical trials for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, lateral sclerosis and pain control.\n\nThe first clinical use of artificial cells was in hemoperfusion by the encapsulation of activated charcoal. Activated charcoal has the capability of adsorbing many large molecules and has for a long time been known for its ability to remove toxic substances from the blood in accidental poisoning or overdose. However, perfusion through direct charcoal administration is toxic as it leads to embolisms and damage of blood cells followed by removal by platelets. Artificial cells allow toxins to diffuse into the cell while keeping the dangerous cargo within their ultrathin membrane.\n\nArtificial cell hemoperfusion has been proposed as a less costly and more efficient detoxifying option than hemodialysis, in which blood filtering takes place only through size separation by a physical membrane. In hemoperfusion, thousands of adsorbent artificial cells are retained inside a small container through the use of two screens on either end through which patient blood perfuses. As the blood circulates, toxins or drugs diffuse into the cells and are retained by the absorbing material. The membranes of artificial cells are much thinner those used in dialysis and their small size means that they have a high membrane surface area. This means that a portion of cell can have a theoretical mass transfer that is a hundredfold higher than that of a whole artificial kidney machine. The device has been established as a routine clinical method for patients treated for accidental or suicidal poisoning but has also been introduced as therapy in liver failure and kidney failure by carrying out part of the function of these organs.\nArtificial cell hemoperfusion has also been proposed for use in immunoadsorption through which antibodies can be removed from the body by attaching an immunoadsorbing material such as albumin on the surface of the artificial cells. This principle has been used to remove blood group antibodies from plasma for bone marrow transplantation and for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia through monoclonal antibodies to remove low-density lipoproteins. Hemoperfusion is especially useful in countries with a weak hemodialysis manufacturing industry as the devices tend to be cheaper there and used in kidney failure patients.\n\nThe most common method of preparation of artificial cells is through cell encapsulation. Encapsulated cells are typically achieved through the generation of controlled-size droplets from a liquid cell suspension which are then rapidly solidified or gelated to provide added stability. The stabilization may be achieved through a change in temperature or via material crosslinking. The microenvironment that a cell sees changes upon encapsulation. It typically goes from being on a monolayer to a suspension in a polymer scaffold within a polymeric membrane. A drawback of the technique is that encapsulating a cell decreases its viability and ability to proliferate and differentiate. Further, after some time within the microcapsule, cells form clusters that inhibit the exchange of oxygen and metabolic waste, leading to apoptosis and necrosis thus limiting the efficacy of the cells and activating the host's immune system.\nArtificial cells have been successful for transplanting a number of cells including islets of Langerhans for diabetes treatment, parathyroid cells and adrenal cortex cells.\n\nShortage of organ donors make artificial cells key players in alternative therapies for liver failure. The use of artificial cells for hepatocyte transplantation has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy in providing liver function in models of animal liver disease and bioartificial liver devices. Research stemmed off experiments in which the hepatocytes were attached to the surface of a micro-carriers and has evolved into hepatocytes which are encapsulated in a three-dimensional matrix in alginate microdroplets covered by an outer skin of polylysine. A key advantage to this delivery method is the circumvention of immunosuppression therapy for the duration of the treatment. Hepatocyte encapsulations have been proposed for use in a bioartifical liver. The device consists of a cylindrical chamber imbedded with isolated hepatocytes through which patient plasma is circulated extra-corporeally in a type of hemoperfusion. Because microcapsules have a high surface area to volume ratio, they provide large surface for substrate diffusion and can accommodate a large number of hepatocytes. Treatment to induced liver failure mice showed a significant increase in the rate of survival. Artificial liver systems are still in early development but show potential for patients waiting for organ transplant or while a patient's own liver regenerates sufficiently to resume normal function. So far, clinical trials using artificial liver systems and hepatocyte transplantation in end-stage liver diseases have shown improvement of health markers but have not yet improved survival. The short longevity and aggregation of artificial hepatocytes after transplantation are the main obstacles encountered.\nHepatocytes co-encapsulated with stem cells show greater viability in culture and after implantation and implantation of artificial stem cells alone have also shown liver regeneration. As such interest has arisen in the use of stem cells for encapsulation in regenerative medicine.\n\nThe oral ingestion of live bacterial cell colonies has been proposed and is currently in therapy for the modulation of intestinal microflora, prevention of diarrheal diseases, treatment of \"H. Pylori\" infections, atopic inflammations, lactose intolerance and immune modulation, amongst others. The proposed mechanism of action is not fully understood but is believed to have two main effects. The first is the nutritional effect, in which the bacteria compete with toxin producing bacteria. The second is the sanitary effect, which stimulates resistance to colonization and stimulates immune response. The oral delivery of bacterial cultures is often a problem because they are targeted by the immune system and often destroyed when taken orally. Artificial cells help address these issues by providing mimicry into the body and selective or long term release thus increasing the viability of bacteria reaching the gastrointestinal system. In addition, live bacterial cell encapsulation can be engineered to allow diffusion of small molecules including peptides into the body for therapeutic purposes. Membranes that have proven successful for bacterial delivery include cellulose acetate and variants of alginate. Additional uses that have arosen from encapsulation of bacterial cells include protection against challenge from \"M. Tuberculosis\" and upregulation of Ig secreting cells from the immune system. The technology is limited by the risk of systemic infections, adverse metabolic activities and the risk of gene transfer. However, the greater challenge remains the delivery of sufficient viable bacteria to the site of interest.\n\nNano sized oxygen carriers are used as a type of red blood cell substitutes, although they lack other components of red blood cells. They are composed of a synthetic polymersome or an artificial membrane surrounding purified animal, human or recombinant hemoglobin.\nOverall, hemoglobin delivery continues to be a challenge because it is highly toxic when delivered without any modifications. In some clinical trials, vasopressor effects have been observed for first generation hemoglobin blood substitutes.\n\nResearch interest in the use of artificial cells for blood arose after the AIDS scare of the 1980s. Besides bypassing the potential for disease transmission, artificial red blood cells are desired because they eliminate drawbacks associated with allogenic blood transfusions such as blood typing, immune reactions and its short storage life of 42 days. A hemoglobin substitute may be stored at room temperature and not under refrigeration for more than a year. Attempts have been made to develop a complete working red blood cell which comprises carbonic not only an oxygen carrier but also the enzymes associated with the cell. The first attempt was made in 1957 by replacing the red blood cell membrane by an ultrathin polymeric membrane which was followed by encapsulation through a lipid membrane and more recently a biodegradable polymeric membrane.\nA biological red blood cell membrane including lipids and associated proteins can also be used to encapsulate nanoparticles and increase residence time in vivo by bypassing macrophage uptake and systemic clearance.\n\nA leuko-polymersome is a polymersome engineered to have the adhesive properties of a leukocyte. Polymersomes are vesicles composed of a bilayer sheet that can encapsulate many active molecules such as drugs or enzymes. By adding the adhesive properties of a leukocyte to their membranes, they can be made to slow down, or roll along epithelial walls within the quickly flowing circulatory system.\n\nThe German pathologist Rudolf Virchow brought forward the idea that not only does life arise from cells, but every cell comes from another cell; \"Omnis cellula e cellula\". Until now, most attempts to create an artificial cell have only created a package that can mimic certain tasks of the cell. Advances in cell-free transcription and translation reactions allow the expression of many genes, but these efforts are far from producing a fully operational cell.\n\nThe future is in the creation of a protocell, or a cell which has all the minimum requirements for life. Members from the J. Craig Venter Institute have used a top-down computational approach to knock out genes in a living organism to a minimum set of genes. In 2010, the team succeeded in creating a replicating strain of \"Mycoplasma mycoides\" (Mycoplasma laboratorium) using synthetically created DNA deemed to be the minimum requirement for life which was inserted into a genomically empty bacterium. It is hoped that the process of top-down biosynthesis will enable the insertion of new genes that would perform profitable functions such as generation of hydrogen for fuel or capturing excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. the myriad regulatory, metabolic, and signaling networks are not completely characterized. These top-down approaches have limitations for the understanding of fundamental molecular regulation, since the host organisms have a complex and incompletely defined molecular composition.\n\nA bottom-up approach to build an artificial cell would involve creating a protocell \"de novo\", entirely from non-living materials. It is proposed to create a phospholipid bilayer vesicle with DNA capable of self-reproducing using synthetic genetic information. The three primary elements of such artificial cells are the formation of a lipid membrane, DNA and RNA replication through a template process and the harvesting of chemical energy for active transport across the membrane. The main hurdles foreseen and encountered with this proposed protocell are the creation of a minimal synthetic DNA that holds all sufficient information for life, and the reproduction of non-genetic components that are integral in cell development such as molecular self-organization. However, it is hoped that this kind of bottom-up approach would provide insight into the fundamental questions of organizations at the cellular level and the origins of biological life. So far, no completely artificial cell capable of self-reproduction has been synthesized using the molecules of life, and this objective is still in a distant future although various groups are currently working towards this goal.\n\nAnother method proposed to create a protocell more closely resembles the conditions believed to have been present during evolution known as the primordial soup. Various RNA polymers could be encapsulated in vesicles and in such small boundary conditions, chemical reactions would be tested for.\n\nHeavy investing in biology has been done by large companies such as ExxonMobil, who has partnered with Synthetic Genomics Inc; Craig Venter's own biosynthetics company in the development of fuel from algae.\n\nThe concept of an Electronic Artificial Cell has been expanded in a series of 3 EU projects coordinated by John McCaskill from 2004-2015.\n\nThe European Commission sponsored the development of the \"Programmable Artificial Cell Evolution\" (PACE) program from 2004-2008 whose goal was to lay the foundation for the creation of \"microscopic self-organizing, self-replicating, and evolvable autonomous entities built from simple organic and inorganic substances that can be genetically programmed to perform specific functions\" for the eventual integration into information systems. The PACE project developed the first Omega Machine, a microfluidic life support system for artificial cells that could complement chemically missing functionalities (as originally proposed by Norman Packard, Steen Rasmussen, Mark Beadau and John McCaskill). The ultimate aim was to attain an evolvable hybrid cell in a complex microscale programmable environment. The functions of the Omega Machine could then be removed stepwise, posing a series of solvable evolution challenges to the artificial cell chemistry. The project achieved chemical integration up to the level of pairs of the three core functions of artificial cells (a genetic subsystem, a containment system and a metabolic system), and generated novel spatially resolved programmable microfluidic environments for the integration of containment and genetic amplification.\"Programmable Artificial Cell Evolution\" (PACE) The project led to the creation of the European center for living technology] which is now continuing similar research.\n\nFollowing this research, in 2007, John McCaskill proposed to concentrate on an electronically complemented artificial cell, called the Electronic Chemical Cell. The key idea was to use a massively parallel array of electrodes coupled to locally dedicated electronic circuitry, in a two-dimensional thin film, to complement emerging chemical cellular functionality. Local electronic information defining the electrode switching and sensing circuits could serve as an electronic genome, complementing the molecular sequential information in the emerging protocols. A research proposal was successful with the European Commission and an international team of scientists partially overlapping with the PACE consortium commenced work 2008-2012 on the project Electronic Chemical Cells. The project demonstrated among other things that electronically controlled local transport of specific sequences could be used as an artificial spatial control system for the genetic proliferation of future artificial cells, and that core processes of metabolism could be delivered by suitably coated electrode arrays.\n\nThe major limitation of this approach, apart from the initial difficulties in mastering microscale electrochemistry and electrokinetics, is that the electronic system is interconnected as a rigid non-autonomous piece of macroscopic hardware. In 2011, McCaskill proposed to invert the geometry of electronics and chemistry : instead of placing chemicals in an active electronic medium, to place microscopic autonomous electronics in a chemical medium. He organized a project to tackle a third generation of Electronic Artificial Cells at the 100Â Âµm scale that could self-assemble from two half-cells \"lablets\" to enclose an internal chemical space, and function with the aid of active electronics powered by the medium they are immersed in. Such cells can copy both their electronic and chemical contents and will be capable of evolution within the constraints provided by their special pre-synthesized microscopic building blocks. In Sep 2012 work commenced on this project Microscale Chemically Reactive Electronic Agents.\n\nProtocell research has created controversy and opposing opinions, including critics of the vague definition of \"artificial life\". The creation of a basic unit of life is the most pressing ethical concern, although the most widespread worry about protocells is their potential threat to human health and the environment through uncontrolled replication.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "408083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=408083", "title": "Borrow pit", "text": "Borrow pit\n\nIn construction and civil engineering, a borrow pit, also known as a sand box, is an area where material (usually soil, gravel or sand) has been dug for use at another location. Borrow pits can be found close to many major construction projects. For example, soil might be excavated to fill an embankment for a highway, clay might be excavated for use in brick-making, gravel to be used for making concrete, etc.\n\nIn some cases, the borrow pits may become filled with ground water, forming recreational areas or sustainable wildlife habitats (one such example is the Merton Borrow Pit, near Oxford in central England, excavated to provide materials for the nearby M40 motorway). In other cases, borrow pits may be used for landfill and waste disposal.\n\nA regional variation of this is termed \"barrow pit\" in the western United States (especially the Rocky Mountains). The localismâsometimes pronounced \"borrer pit\"âdescribes the ditch along a roadway. These ditches were created to provide the fill to level and crown the roadway and subsequently provided drainage for the road.\n\nAn excavation lake (also a flooded gravel pit) is an artificial lake, which usually has its origins in the excavation of gravel or sand for construction materials or in some other kind of surface mining. In many cases, the excavation holes are landscaped according to the land restoration required by law. Because the excavation reached a point below the water table, lakes form naturally. Less frequently excavation lakes are intentionally created, especially as recreation areas.\n\nIn Germany the lakes are almost always used for fishing, since a fishery is created by law with every surface water. At some excavation lakes, beaches are added for swimming or other water sports, in particular boating, water skiing or windsurfing. To support these uses, large parking lots, changing areas, and eating areas are also set up. In some cases, the excavation lake serves as a nature reserve, as in the case of the lakes in the Attenborough Nature Reserve.\n\n"}

Although only in operation for four years, they were connected with several prominent theater and film professionals, such as C. Pascal Franchot (later known as film actor Franchot Tone); Marian de Forest, founder of Zonta International and Buffalo civic leader; and Broadway and Hollywood actor Jerome Collamore.\n\nThey were also in part the inspiration for two other community theater groups, the Niagara Falls Little Theater (Now Niagara Regional Theatre Guild), which was founded in 1924, and the Rochester Community Players, continuously operating since 1925. Founding members also assisted in the launch of the Studio Theater School, predecessor of Buffalo's Studio Arena Theater.\n\nMarian de Forest was the president of the organization. She continued as a theater critic for the Buffalo Express even while serving as the head of the Buffalo Players. At a speech before the newly-forming Niagara Falls Players Association on November 6, 1924, she described how, in the early days of the Buffalo organization, they only had 'hope and faith', and 'depended on charity.' She said they started looking for a suitable place two years earlier, examining barns, a brewery and churches, before coming on what she described as a \"forlorn\" Allendale theater, with aisle too narrow, seats too close together and decorations in very poor condition, and that by 1924 the theater was in 'fine style'.\n\nThe offices and rehearsal space of the Players was in an historic house at 334 Delaware Avenue, built in the 1860s and leased from the owner, Dr. Charles Cary. The house was located between the Cary home at 340 Delaware, and the home of Lawrence D. Rumsey at 330 Delaware.\n\nLars S. Potter was Vice President of the organization and Pascal Franchot was secretary of the new organization, and a forceful speaker on its behalf.\n\nThe organization was publicly launched at a meeting at the Iroquois Hotel, Buffalo November 23, 1922, with Walter Hampden as the guest speaker and Buffalo Players President de Forest presiding.\n\nThe Players leased the Allendale Theater, starting January 1923 with an 18-month lease.\n\nThe Buffalo Players had reached membership of 2,560 by the opening of the 1924-25 season, according to Pascal Franchot. Going into the 1925-26 season, the Buffalo Players had a membership of nearly 2,600.\nIn the summer of 1925, the Buffalo Players started putting out a newsletter called \"The Cue\", and adopted a 'seal' or logo designed by Urquhart Wilcox: the skull of a buffalo inside a triangle.\n\nFrom available records, the following is a partial list of productions staged by the Buffalo Players:\n\nThe first production presented by the organization was \"A Curious Mishap\" by Carlo Goldoni, opening January 24, 1923.\n\nSecond production: Three one act plays: \"The Dear Departed\", by Stanley Houghton, \"Finders, Keepers\" by George Kelly, and \"Sham\" by Frank G.

The space has been operated most recently as \"TheaterLoft\" by the Ujima Company\n\n\"Wappin' Wharf\" by Charles S. Brooks, opening at the Elmwood Avenue space December 16, 1926\n\nA one-act children's play, \"Puck Plkays Christmas\" by Ethel C. Wilcox of Buffalo. The production intended for the Christmas Season, but opened January 18, 1927 due to the remodeling of the Elmwood Avenue space.\n\nThree one-act plays: \"The Constant Lover\" by St. John Hankin; \"The Wonder Hat\" by Kenneth Sawyer Goodman and Ben Hecht, and \"Dnger\", by Richard Hughes.\n\n\"Dear Brutus\" by J. M. Barrie, opening March 28, 1927 This was the last production staged by the Buffalo Players.\n\nFrederick Kitson Cowley was the first 'Art Director' (artistic or managing director) of the Buffalo Players. Cowley had attended the Art Institute of Chicago. He was an illustrator who had taught at the University of Illinois, the University of Minnesota and the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He had fifteen years of experience prior to coming to the Buffalo Players, and had directed soldoers' plays in France and Italy as part of the World War I American Expeditionary Force. At the organization's first public meeting, Crowley stated that the theater was at its highest development in the age of William Shakespeare, Richard Burbage, and Edward Alleyn, and that contemporary theater was over-commercialized and controlled by people not primarily interested in theater as an art. The purpose of groups like the Buffalo Players was to foster a love for theater of artistic value. \"Our community theater will be to all intents in the hands of the actors. It is better to have freedom of motion in the theaters with amateurs thaan to have ever-so-capable actors dominated by those who know little and care less for the art of the stage.\"\n\nEric Seton Snowden, of California, was engaged as the director of the Buffalo Players in July, 1923. Snowden believed in popular entertainment. \"I am extremely weary of uplifting drama. It simply isn't being done anymore, either. Out in Pasadina [the Pasadena Playhouse, California], where I spent part of the summer, the Community theater there had achieved a howling success with such offerings as Potash and Perlmutter. The little theaterite is finding out that he can't take himself too seriously, or he will be laughed out of court. The community theater, if it is to continue to function.. . must take off its high heeled boots and tread like folks. The high brow ideal that use to be obtained doesn't mix with box office receipts, and for an unsubsidized theater such as we have here at the present time, the latter has just got to be considered. The primary objective of any theater, for that matter, is to entertain; and nothing that is deadly dull, as uplift productions mostly are, can either function or endure.\"\n\nBroadway and Hollywood actor Jerome Collamore was named to succeed Mr. Snowden in August 1925. In a newspaper interview, he stated that \"the drama is the greatest force of good there is. . . it is better than the pulpet, since the play is that medium of education which appeals to the emotions.\" In speaking of the Buffalo Players, and community theater in general, \"Yours is a splendid spirit, since you are feeling out constantly for new talent, new material. Therein lies your opportunity. You can do the unusual. You are not limited to the things to which the commercial theater is limited. The true spirit in a community theater is that which allows for growth, which visualizes the future of American drama.\" Mr. Collamore was released at the end of the 1925-26 season.\n\nThe final professional director of the Buffalo Players, for the 1926-27 season, was Harold P. Preston. He stated that \"The Buffalo Players will, this season, produce only plays which we believe significant. But this does not mean that our productions will be uninteresting. Quite the contrary. There is an 'all too general impression that art, and especially dramatic art, is stodgy dull, tragic. Nothing is farther from the truth. Some of the merriest of plays are artistic. Most significant plays are interesting, not alone for the problem they may solve or present, but likewise because they aie well written, dramatic plays. The Buffalo Players will not, however, make even a slight obeisance in the direction of the box office. We will be only too happy to have large audiences. But we want audiences who come to us because the wish to see the fine things of the theatre, done with sincerity and understanding. We want audiences who want the sort of plays and productions which will make Buffalo take its place among the cities of the United States interested in, and fostering, the worth while in dramatic art.\"\n\nDissension over the direction of the program reached the newspapers in April 1926. Jessie Bonstelle, a former Buffalo stock producer and actress, had been quoted as saying, in regard to little theaters, \"these groups invariably become cliques and snobbishness develops, offsetting whatever possibilities the Little Theater might have for good.\" In response, Sibylla Schiling, a cast member in the production of \"The Climax\", replied \"The Little Theater movement tends, particularly in the stance of the Buffalo Players where everyone who is interested may come in and take part, to discourage snobbishness.\"\n\nIn the Spring of 1926, a competing community theater organization first presented a production in Buffalo, the Volday Players. According to a newspaper account, \"the members of the cast are. . . familiar to Buffaloians through their appearance in Buffalo Players' performances.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of the 1925-26 season, the group apparently intended to change their production policy, from being a 'community theater' emphasizing popular theatrical fare, to a 'Little Theater', concentrating on more artistic production. According to one newspaper analysis, being a 'little theater' was the original idea of the group, and they were considering relocation to \"a pleasant old barn\", which would be turned into an intimate 300 seat theater.\n\nPeople associated with the Volday Players filed incorporation papers for the Buffalo Little Theater Guild, Inc. in the summer or fall of 1926. A newspaper report characterized the move as \"a definite split in the ranks of the Buffalo Players\" and listed supporters of the new Guild as including Howard L. Volgeneau (President of the new group), George H. Richardson, Julius H. Potter, Kevin O'Callahan, and Myron C. Dulvany. The newspaper report stated that Lars S. Potter and the Buffalo Players was surprised by the incorporation, but that it would have no effect on the plans for their upcoming season. The report described those plans as following: \"The Buffalo Players at the present time are raising funds for the acquisition of a theater of their own in which to produce their plays. Up until last spring the Playhouse in Allen Street was leased to them, but with the close of the 1925-26 season the Playhouse was turned back to its owners, who have reestablished it as a motion picture house. Jerome Collamore, producing director of the Buffalo Players, was released with the presentation of the final play, \"The Thief\". Since then various rumors with respect to the directorship plans have been afloat.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1926, the Buffalo Players had a decision to make: whether to continue as a community theater program, with popular entertainment at a large playhouse and the need to raise $40,000 per year, or to convert to a strict \"Little Theater\", with a small performance space, concentrating on productions perceived to be of artistic merit, and avowedly with no concern for box office receipts. As shown by the quote from Mr. Preston, cited above, the Buffalo Players chose to go the Little Theater route.\n\nA year later, in the Summer of 1927, the Buffalo Players operation, including its assets, performance space and \"good-will\", was merged into the Studio School of the Theater, operated by Jane Keeler and Sheldon Viele. This is considered the origins of the Studio Arena Theater (see: Studio Arena Theater). A letter was sent by the officers of the Buffalo Players to the membership in July, 1927, announcing this merger. Performances and classes for the Studio School were held in the Buffalo Players former space on the corner of Elmwood Avenue and Anderson Place. Keeler directed the Studio Theater School until 1958, and died in 1974 at age 94.\n\nMarian de Forest, as president of the Buffalo Players, wrote to 'leading citizens' of Niagara Falls in early 1924, inviting them to an organizational meeting of he Niagara Falls Little Theater, a community theater organization, on February 6 at the Chamber of Commerce. The invitation stated \"the proposed organization will be patterned after the Players association of Buffalo and similar institutions in other cities...\" Ms. de Forest spoke on the history and experience of the Buffalo Players at the meeting (this is the meeting described in \"organization\", above).\nNiagara Falls launched its program with a production of \"Wedding Bells\", by Salisbury Field, in May 1924. The director of the play was Fred Kitson Cowley, the first director of the Buffalo Players. Crowley remained director of the group until 1927 The chairman of the new organization was Edward (\"Ned\") Franchot, cousin of Pascal Franchot, founding member of the Buffalo Players. Edward Franchot was a member of the cast of the first Buffalo Players production, \"The Curious Mishap\".\n\nThe first organizational luncheon of the Rochester Community Players was held at the Sagamore Hotel, Rochester NY, in October 1923, and Pascal Franchot, representing the Buffalo Players, was the principal speaker.\n\nIn December 1924, the Buffalo Players took their production of \"Fashion\" to Rochester, NY as an example to the newly formed Rochester Community Players as to what a community theater was capable of producing. The Rochester organization commenced its own program January 19, 1925 with a production \"Wedding Bells\", by Salisbury Field (the same play that opened the Niagara Falls program eight months earlier.)\n"}

{"id": "411309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=411309", "title": "Cadence (music)", "text": "Cadence (music)\n\nIn Western musical theory, a cadence (Latin \"cadentia\", \"a falling\") is \"a melodic or harmonic configuration that creates a sense of resolution [finality or pause].\" A harmonic cadence is a progression of (at least) two chords that concludes a phrase, section, or piece of music. A rhythmic cadence is a characteristic rhythmic pattern that indicates the end of a phrase. \n\nA cadence is labeled more or less \"weak\" or \"strong\" depending on its sense of finality. While cadences are usually classified by specific chord or melodic progressions, the use of such progressions does not necessarily constitute a cadenceâthere must be a sense of closure, as at the end of a phrase. Harmonic rhythm plays an important part in determining where a cadence occurs.\n\nCadences are strong indicators of the tonic or central pitch of a passage or piece. Edward Lowinsky proposed that the cadence was the \"cradle of tonality\".\n\nIn music of the common practice period, cadences are divided into four main types, according to their harmonic progression: \"authentic\" (typically \"perfect authentic\" or \"imperfect authentic\"), \"half\", \"plagal\", and \"deceptive\". Typically, phrases end on authentic or half cadences, and the terms \"plagal\" and \"deceptive\" refer to motion that avoids or follows a phrase-ending cadence. Each cadence can be described using the Roman numeral system of naming chords.\n\nAn authentic cadence is a cadence from V to I (or VâI). A seventh above the root is often added to create V, and the V is often preceded by a cadential chord. \"The Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" says, \"This cadence is a microcosm of the tonal system, and is the most direct means of establishing a pitch as tonic. It is virtually obligatory as the final structural cadence of a tonal work.\" Authentic cadences are generally classified as either \"perfect\" or \"imperfect\". The phrase \"perfect cadence\" is sometimes used as a synonym for \"authentic cadence\" but can also have a more precise meaning depending on the chord voicing.\n\nIn a perfect authentic cadence (PAC), the chords are in root position â that is, the roots of both chords are in the bass â and the tonic is in the highest voice of the final chord. This is generally considered the strongest type of cadence and often found at structurally defining moments. Music theorist William Caplin writes that the perfect authentic cadence \"achieves complete harmonic and melodic closure.\"\n</score>\n\nThere are three distinct types of imperfect authentic cadences (IAC):\n\n\n</score>\n\nAn evaded cadence goes from V to I. Because the seventh must fall step wise, it forces the cadence to resolve to the less stable first inversion chord. To achieve this, a root position V usually changes to a V right before resolution, thereby \"evading\" the cadence. (See also inverted cadence below.)\n</score>\n\nA half cadence (also called an \"imperfect cadence\" or \"semicadence\") is any cadence ending on V, whether preceded by II (V of V), ii, vi, IV, or Iâor any other chord. Because it sounds incomplete or suspended, the half cadence is considered a weak cadence that calls for continuation.\n\n</score>\n\nSeveral types of half cadences are described below.\nA Phrygian half cadence is a half cadence ivâV in minor, so named because the semitonal motion in the bass (sixth degree to fifth degree) resembles the half-step heard in the iiâI of the 15th-century cadence in the Phrygian mode. Due to its being a survival from modal Renaissance harmony this cadence gives an archaic sound, especially when preceded by v (vâivâV). A characteristic gesture in Baroque music, the Phrygian cadence often concluded a slow movement immediately followed by a faster one. With the addition of motion in the upper part to the sixth degree, it becomes the Landini cadence.\n</score>\n\nA Lydian cadence is similar to the Phrygian half cadence, involving ivâV in the minor. The difference is that in the Lydian cadence, the whole iv is raised by a half step. In other words, the Phrygian half cadence begins with the first chord built on scale degree , while the Lydian half cadence is built on the scale degree .\n\n</score>\n\nBurgundian cadences became popular in Burgundian music. Note the parallel fourths between the upper voices.\n</score>\n\nThe rare plagal half cadence involves a IâIV progression. Like an authentic cadence (VâI), the plagal half cadence involves a descending fifth (or, by inversion, an ascending fourth). The plagal half cadence is a weak cadence, ordinarily at the ending of an antecedent phrase, after which a consequent phrase commences. One example of this use is in \"Auld Lang Syne\". But in one very unusual occurrence â the end of the exposition of the first movement of Brahms' Clarinet Trio, Op. 114âit is used to complete not just a musical phrase but an entire section of a movement.\n\nA plagal cadence is a cadence from IV to I. It is also known as the \"Amen cadence\" because of its frequent setting to the text \"Amen\" in hymns.\n\n</score>\n\nWilliam Caplin disputes the existence of plagal cadences in music of the classical era:\n\nIt may be noticed that the plagal cadence, \"leaves open the possibility of interpretation as VâIâV\" rather than IâIVâI. The term \"minor plagal cadence\" is used to refer to the ivâI progression. Sometimes a combination of major and minor plagal cadence is used (IVâivâI)\n\nA deceptive cadence (also called an \"interrupted cadence\") is a cadence from V to vi. The most important irregular resolution, most commonly Vâvi (or VâVI) in major or VâVI in minor. This is considered a weak cadence because of the \"hanging\" (suspended) feeling it invokes.\n\n</score>\n\nAt the beginning of the final movement of Gustav Mahler's 9th Symphony, the listener hears a string of many deceptive cadences progressing from V to IV.\n\nOne of the most striking uses of this cadence is in the A-minor section at the end of the exposition in the first movement of Brahms' Third Symphony. The music progresses to an implied E minor dominant (B) with a rapid chromatic scale upwards but suddenly sidesteps to C major. The same device is used again in the recapitulation; this time the sidestep isâas one would expectâto F major, the tonic key of the whole Symphony.\n\nThe interrupted cadence is also frequently used in popular music. For example, the Pink Floyd song \"Bring the Boys Back Home\" ends with such a cadence (at approximately 0:45â50).\n\nAn inverted cadence (also called a \"medial cadence\") inverts the last chord. It may be restricted only to the perfect and imperfect cadence, or only to the perfect cadence, or it may apply to cadences of all types. To distinguish them from this form, the other, more common forms of cadences listed above are known as \"radical cadences\".\n\nCadences can also be classified by their rhythmic position:\n\n\nMetrically accented cadences are considered stronger and are generally of greater structural significance. In the past, the terms \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" were sometimes used to describe rhythmically \"strong\" or \"weak\" cadences, but this terminology is no longer acceptable to some. Susan McClary has written extensively on the gendered terminology of music and music theory in her book \"Feminine Endings.\"\n\nThe example below shows a metrically unaccented cadence (IVâVâI). The final chord is postponed to fall on a weak beat.\n\n</score>\n\nA Picardy third (or Picardy cadence) is a harmonic device that originated in Western music in the Renaissance era. It refers to the use of a major chord of the tonic at the end of a musical section that is either modal or in a minor key. The example below shows a picardy third in J.S. Bach's \"Jesu, meine Freude\" (Jesus, My Joy), mm. 12â13.\n\n</score>\n\nThe example below shows a cadence featuring an upper leading-tone from a well-known 16th-century lamentation, the debate over which was documented in Rome c.1540. The final three written notes in the upper voice are BâCâD, in which case a trill on C produces D. However, convention implied a C, and a cadential trill of a whole tone on the second to last note produces D/E, the upper leading-tone of D. Presumably, the debate was over whether to use CâD or CâD for the trill. ( )\n\n</score>\n\nMedieval and Renaissance cadences are based upon dyads rather than chords. The first theoretical mention of cadences comes from Guido of Arezzo's description of the \"occursus\" in his Micrologus, where he uses the term to mean where the two lines of a two-part polyphonic phrase end in a unison.\n\nA clausula or clausula vera (\"true close\") is a dyadic or intervallic, rather than chordal or harmonic, cadence. In a clausula vera, two voices approach an octave or unison through stepwise motion in contrary motion.\n\n</score>\nIn three voices, the third voice often adds a falling fifth creating a cadence similar to the authentic cadence in tonal music.\n\n</score>\n\nAccording to Carl Dahlhaus, \"as late as the 13th century the half step was experienced as a problematic interval not easily understood, as the remainder between the perfect fourth and the ditone:\n\nIn a melodic half step, listeners of the time perceived no tendency of the lower tone toward the upper, or the upper toward the lower. The second tone was not the 'goal' of the first. Instead, musicians avoided the half step in clausulas because, to their ears, it lacked clarity as an interval. Beginning in the 13th century cadences begin to require motion in one voice by half step and the other a whole step in contrary motion.\n\nA plagal cadence was found occasionally as an interior cadence, with the lower voice in two-part writing moving up a perfect fifth or down a perfect fourth.\n\n</score>\n\nA pause in one voice may also be used as a weak interior cadence. The example below, Lassus's \"Qui vult venire post me\", mm. 3â5, shows a pause in the third measure.\n\n</score>\n\nIn counterpoint, an evaded cadence is one where one of the voices in a suspension does not resolve as expected, and the voices together resolved to a consonance other than an octave or unison (a perfect fifth, a sixth, or a third).\n\nThe Corelli cadence, or Corelli clash, named for its association with the violin music of the Corelli school, is a cadence characterized by a major and/or minor second clash between the tonic and the leading-tone or the tonic and supertonic. An example is shown below.\n\n</score>\n\nAnother \"clash cadence\", the English cadence, is a contrapuntal pattern particular to the authentic or perfect cadence. It features the blue seventh against the dominant chord, which in the key of C would be B and GâBâD. Popular with English composers of the High Renaissance and Restoration periods in the 16th and 17th centuries, the English cadence is described as archaic or old-fashioned sounding. It was first given its name in the 20th century. \n\nThe hallmark of this device is the dissonant augmented octave (compound augmented unison) produced by a false relation between the split seventh scale degree, as shown below in an excerpt from \"O sacrum convivium\" by Thomas Tallis. The courtesy accidental on the tenor's G is editorial.\n\n \\override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t\n</score>\n\nA Landini cadence (also known as a \"Landini sixth\", \"Landini sixth cadence\", or \"under-third cadence\") is a cadence that was used extensively in the 14th and early 15th century. It is named after Francesco Landini, a composer who used them prodigiously. Similar to a clausula vera, it includes an escape tone in the upper voice, which briefly narrows the interval to a perfect fifth before the octave.\n\n</score>\n\nIn the Classical period, composers often drew out the authentic cadences at the ends of sections; the cadence's dominant chord might take up a measure or two, especially if it contained the resolution of a suspension remaining from the chord preceding the dominant. During these two measures, the solo instrument (in a concerto) often played a trill on the supertonic (the fifth of the dominant chord); although supertonic and subtonic trills had been common in the Baroque era, they usually lasted only a half measure.\n\nExtended cadential trills were by far most frequent in Mozart's music, and although they were also found in early Romantic music, their use was restricted chiefly to piano concerti (and to a lesser extent, violin concerti) because they were most easily played and most effective on the piano and violin; the cadential trill and resolution would be generally followed by an orchestral coda. Beethoven was a good example of this, limiting it almost entirely to his concerti, and most other Romantic composers including Chopin and Schumann followed suit; Schubert, who did not write any concerti, hardly used it at all (the \"Adagio and Rondo Concertante\" D. 487, a chamber work, being one prominent exception). At the other end of the spectrum, even Mozart rarely used the trill in symphonies. Because the music generally became louder and more dramatic leading up to it, a cadence was used for climactic effect, and was often embellished by Romantic composers. Later on in the Romantic era, however, other dramatic virtuosic movements were often used to close sections instead.\n\nIn jazz, a cadence is often referred to as a \"turnaround\", chord progressions that lead back and resolve to the tonic (for example, the ii-V-I turnaround). Turnarounds may be used at any point and not solely before the tonic.\n\nHalf-step cadences are common in jazz if not clichÃ©. For example, the ascending diminished seventh chord half-step cadence, whichâusing a secondary diminished seventh chordâcreates momentum between two chords a major second apart (with the diminished seventh in between).\n\n</score>\n\nThe descending diminished seventh chord half-step cadence is assisted by two common tones.\n\n</score>\n\nRhythmic cadences often feature a final note longer than the prevailing note values and this often follows a characteristic rhythmic pattern repeated at the end of the phrase. The example below shows a characteristic rhythmic cadence at the end of the first phrase of J.S. Bach's \"Brandenburg Concerto\" No. 3 in G major, BMV 1048, mvmt. I, mm. 1â2:\n\n} </score>\n\n"}
{"id": "2856189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2856189", "title": "Caleb Gattegno", "text": "Caleb Gattegno\n\nCaleb Gattegno (1911â1988) was one of the most influential and prolific mathematics educators of the twentieth century. He is best known for his innovative approaches to teaching and learning mathematics (Visible & Tangible Math), foreign languages (The Silent Way) and reading (Words in Color). He is also the inventor of pedagogical materials for each of these approaches, and the author of more than 120 books and hundreds of articles largely on the topics of education and human development.\n\nGattegnoâs pedagogical approach is characterised by propositions based on the observation of human learning in many and varied situations. This is a description of three of these propositions.\n\nGattegno noticed that there is an âenergy budgetâ for learning. Human beings have a highly developed sense of the economics of their own energy and are very sensitive to the cost involved in using it. It is therefore essential to teach in ways that are efficient in terms of the amount of energy spent by learners. To be able to mathematically determine whether one method was more efficient than another, he created a unit of measurement for the effort used to learn. He called that unit an \"ogden\", and one can only say an \"ogden\" has been spent if the learning was done outside of ordinary functionings, and was retained. For example, learning one word in a foreign language costs one \"ogden\", but if the word cannot be recalled, the \"ogden\" has not truly been spent. Gattegno's teaching materials and techniques were designed to be economical with \"ogdens\", so that the most information can be recalled with the least sense of effort.\n\nCertain kinds of learning are very expensive in terms of energy, i.e., \"ogdens\", while others are practically free. Memorization is a very expensive way to learn. The energy cost can be especially high when the content is of no particular interest to the learner. Memorizing dates in history or major exports of foreign countries is like that, for most people. School is not the only place where that kind of learning is found. Learning somebody's name or telephone number is equally arbitrary. We have to use our own energy to make such arbitrary items stick in our memories. The âmental glueâ necessary is expensive, since that type of learning uses up a lot of energy.\n\nNot only is that type of learning expensive, it tends also to be fragile. It is typically difficult to remember those kinds of items. Even when we make a great effort, we do not always succeed. We often recognise a face without being able to remember the name of the person ... not to mention all that almost all of us have forgotten much of what we \"learned\" at school. It is not unusual for us to forget much of what we memorize.\n\nHowever, there is another way of functioning, which Gattegno called retention. An example of retention is the reception of sensory images. When we look at something â a street, a film, a person, a fine view â photons move from what we are contemplating and enter our eyes to strike the retina. When we listen to something, we create auditory images in a similar way, that is, through energy that enters our system, rather than energy we allocate from inside, to memorize an arbitrary item. To retain an auditory or visual image, we have to use perhaps only an insignificant amount of our own to retain it; the amount is so small we are not aware of any effort. Such images are easily acquired and generally remain for long periods. We all have experiences similar to the following examples Gattegno offered:\n\n\"First experience: \"I recently visited a village in the south of France where I had not been for over 10 years and I was able to say, 'Oh, yes, I know. The pharmacy is over there beyond the bakerâs.' I went to see and there it was. I had made no effort to memorise this village square. It had entered my mind during my previous visits and it had remained there.\"\"\n\n\"Second experience: \"I visit a supermarket and go down the aisles. I see an unexceptional woman with a trolley. Three aisles further on, I see her again. I have not tried to remember her, but I have seen her and I can recognise her again a little later.\"\"\n\nOur system of retention is extremely efficient. We keep in our minds a huge quantity of information simply because we have seen, heard, tasted, smelled or felt it. That ability is part of human nature. It enables us to walk about our town without getting lost, to ski or to read a book.\n\nGattegno proposed that we base education, not on memorization, which has a high energetic cost and is often unreliable, but on retention. The learning tools and techniques Gattegno proposed rely systematically on retention.\n\nGattegno argued that for pedagogical actions to be effective, teaching should be subordinated to learning, which requires that as an absolute prerequisite teachers must understand how people learn. Rather than present facts for memorization, teachers construct challenges for students to conquer. If the student cannot conquer the challenge easily, the teacher does not tell the answer, but observes and asks questions to determine where the confusion lies, and what awareness needs to be triggered in the student.\n\nThe role of teachers is not to try to transmit knowledge, but to engender acts of awareness in their students, for only awareness is educable. Gattegno created pedagogical materials designed to provoke awarenesses. The materials are intended to be used along with techniques aimed at leading students through a succession of awarenesses. As the students progress, teachers who observe their students can see when and how they can induce a new act of awareness.\n\nFor example, he created Words in Colour for learning to read. Briefly, it consists of a series of word charts using a colour code in which each colour represents a phoneme of the language. The charts are used to provoke the phonological awareness in students of the sounds they are making and the order in which they are making them thus engendering all the awarenesses of how the graphemes relate to the phonemes and of how the spatial order of writing reflects the chronological order of speech. Other charts, called Fidels, list the graphemes for each phoneme.\n\nHe also used this colour code in The Silent Way materials for learning foreign languages to enable students to identify and produce the sounds of the new language. Cuisenaire rods are used, particularly with beginners, to create visible and tangible situations from which the students can induce the structures of the language. The silence of the teacher both gives the students room to explore the language and frees the teacher to observe the students. The teacher is thus able to propose a sequence of pedagogical challenges adapted precisely to the evolution of the studentsâ learning. \"If I would be remembered for anything\", he said in one of his last seminars, \"it would be that I painted the sounds with colours.\"\n\nIn his approach to teaching mathematics, manipulatives, such as Geoboards which he invented and Cuisenaire Rods which he popularised, are part of a way of systematically developing studentsâ mathematical thinking through the exploration of clear and tangible problems.\n\nAll the materials created by Gattegno were designed to allow teachers using them to place the accent systematically on the studentsâ learning rather than on what they, the teachers, do. Teachers watch their students deal with the challenges they are given, and provide them with feedback on their trials and errors. Teachers thus actively base their work on the awareness and awarenesses of the students, in the here and now. It is therefore very difficult for a teacher to closely follow a detailed lesson-plan, since the students are actively exploring the domain and have the freedom to take the lesson wherever they need it to go. The class becomes a kind of guided improvisation in which the teacher launches a challenge at a suitable level for the students, and if necessary nudges them into the awarenesses they need to have in order to learn. This is the case whatever the subject being dealt with, and is what is meant by Gattegnoâs expression, âthe subordination of teaching to learningâ.\n\nGattegno found that only awareness is educable in human beings. On the path to learning, several awarenesses must be reached. The first is the awareness that there is something to be learned, some unknown to become known. The next awarenesses are triggered by experience with the subject matter. For example, rather than ask a student to write \"2+2=4,\" Gattegno might ask them to create the number 4 in as many ways as possible with colored rods. The student can then clearly see, feel, and describe the characteristics of the number 4. Instead of memorizing \"2+2=4,\" the student has had a mathematical experience, and become aware that \"4\" can be broken into parts, and that the process of breaking apart and putting together can be described in several ways.\n\nWe are constantly becoming aware of new things. When it is something significant, the awareness is often audible in the form of the âAh!â so typical of an important realisation. However, most realisations are made much more discretely. Indeed, as we live our everyday lives, we become aware of all sorts of things at great speed throughout the day: the price of bananas, that these bananas are not ripe enough, that the price of the yoghurts has been reduced because they are close to their sell-by date â¦. All our life is a succession of tiny awarenesses. Until we become aware of something, that thing remains totally unknown to us. As soon as we become aware of it and integrate it into our lives, we often no longer pay attention to it. But the moment of realisation, the act of learning, is an act of awareness.\n\nThe role of the teacher in acts of learning is not to inform students of this or that piece of information, but to help them to discover it, to perform a conscious act to become aware of it.\n\nGattegno suggests that learning takes place in four stages which can be described in terms of awareness.\n\nThe first stage consists in a single act of awareness: the realisation that there is something new to be explored. As long as I am unaware that there is something to be known, I cannot start to learn.\n\nThe second stage: As soon as I start to learn, I have to explore the situation in order to understand it. As I am not yet an expert in the field, I make many mistakes. These mistakes enable me to progress because by observing what happens and becoming aware of it I can adapt my attempts in relation to the feedback given by the environment. This stage ends when I know what I have to do, but I only succeed when I am wholly present in what I am doing.\n\nThe third stage is a transitional stage. At the beginning, I am able to do what I want if I pay attention at each instant. At the end of this stage I no longer need to pay attention: the new skill has become completely automatic and because it is automatic, I am free to give my attention to learning other things.\n\nThe fourth stage is that of transfer. For the rest of my life, what I have learnt can be used for all the new skills I may wish to acquire. When I learnt to run, I used the know-how I had acquired from learning to walk. Both of these, walking and running, were useful to me when I decided to learn cross-country skiing. Each skill remains available, except in the rare cases of accident or injury, for a lifetime.\n\n\n\n"}

It contains the thermal baths of a vast property owned in the 2nd century AD by Herodes Atticus and his wife Annia Regilla.\n\nFormerly privately owned, the property at No. 222 on the Appian Way was acquired by the Italian Government in 2002. The area of the baths was at that time being used for grape growing. The origin of the name given to the site dates back to medieval times, when the area was known as the âCasale di Capo di Bove e di Capo di Vaccaâ (Hamlet of the Heads of the Ox and Cow), so named after the sculptures on the nearby tomb of Caecilia Metella. The area was purchased in 1302 by Cardinal Francesco Caetani, nephew of Pope Boniface VIII. In the 17th century the area served as a hospital while in the 19th century it was under the control of the monastery at the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls.\n\nThe excavations, which can be visited daily free of charge, revealed thermal baths dating back to the middle of the 2nd century. These baths were used until at least the 4th century and were almost certainly for private use. Greek inscriptions found there remind us of the Greek origins of Herodes Atticus. There are several well-preserved mosaics and the high quality of building materials used suggest a very elegant environment with the usual rooms found in Roman baths, i.e. a \"caldarium\" (hot bath), a \"tepidarium\" (warm bath) and \"frigidarium\" (cold bath). Water was provided by two large cisterns.\n\nThe site also includes a former farmhouse converted by the previous occupant of the site into a villa. The building incorporates numerous Roman ruins into the walls, including pipes from the baths that are built into some of the windows. An internal exhibition contains photographs of the Appian Way in the first half of the 20th Century.\n\n"}
{"id": "57976171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57976171", "title": "Chu (Daoism)", "text": "Chu (Daoism)\n\nChu (å», lit. \"kitchen\") is a Daoist name used for various religious practices including communal \"chu\" (Kitchen) banquet rituals in Way of the Celestial Masters liturgy, the legendary \"xingchu\" (è¡å», Mobile Kitchen) associated with Daoist \"xian\" (\"transcendents; 'immortals'\"), and \"wuchu\" (äºå», Five Kitchens) representing the \"wuzang\" (äºè, Five Viscera) in \"neidan\" meditation techniques.\n\n\"ChÃº\" (\"kitchen; to cook; a cook\") can be written with three Chinese characters å», ã, and å¨. The common traditional Chinese character å» combines the \"house radical\" å¹¿ with a phonetic indicator \"shÃ¹\" å° (joining \"zhÃ¹\" å£´ \"drum\" and \"cÃ¹n\" å¯¸ \"hand\"); and the variant traditional character ã has \"cliff radical\" å instead of å¹¿. The simplified Chinese character å¨ omits the å£« element in å£´, leading to a \"graphic folk etymology\" of \"A å 'room' for cooking è± 'beans' with your å¯¸ 'hands'.\" (Bishop 2016). The Chinese logograph å» was anciently used as a loan character for \"chÃº\" æ«¥ (with the \"wood radical\" æ¨, \"cabinet\") or \"chÃº\" å¹® (\"cloth radical\" å·¾, \"a screen used for a temporary kitchen\").\n\nThe Modern Standard Chinese lexicon uses \"chu\" in many compound words, for instance, \"chÃºfÃ¡ng\" (å»æ¿ with æ¿ \"room\", \"kitchen\"), \"chÃºshÄ«\" (å»å¸« with å¸« \"master\", \"cook; chef\"), \"chÃºdÄo\" (å»å with å \"knife\", \"kitchen knife\"), and \"pÃ¡ochÃº\" (åºå» with åº \"kitchen\", meaning \"kitchen\").\n\nIn Daoist specialized vocabulary, \"chu\" names a Kitchen-feast communal meal, and sometimes has a technical meaning of \"magic\", \"used to designate the magical recipes through which one becomes invisible\" (Maspero 1981: 290). The extensive semantic field of \"chu\" can be summarized in some key Daoist expressions: ritual banquets, communion with divinities, granaries (\"zang\" è, a word that also denotes the viscera), visualization of the Five Viscera (\"wuzang\" äºè, written with the \"flesh radical\" âº¼), and abstention from cereals (\"bigu\"), and other food proscriptions (Mollier 2008a: 279). According to Daoist classics, when \"bigu\" \"grain avoidance\" techniques were successful, \"xingchu\" (è¡å», Mobile Kitchens or \"tianchu\" (å¤©å», Celestial Kitchens) were brought in gold and jade vessels by the \"yunÃ¼\" (çå¥³, Jade Women) and \"jintong\" (éå®, Golden Boys), associated with the legendary Jade Emperor (Despeux 2008: 233-234).\n\nChinese Buddhist terminology applies \"chu\" (å», cf. æ«¥ \"cabinet\") \"kitchen; kitchen cupboard\" to denote the \"cabinet for an image or relic of the Buddhas\", translating Sanskrit \"bhakta-ÅÄlÄ\" \"food-hall\" or \"mahÃ¢nasa\" \"kitchen\" (Digital Dictionary of Buddhism).\n\nIn Chinese astronomy, \"TiÄnchÃº\" (å¤©å», Celestial Kitchen) is the name of an asterism in the constellation Draco, located next to \"TiÄnbÃ ng\" (å¤©æ£, Celestial Flail), and \"NÃ¨ichÃº\" (å§å», Inner Kitchen).\n\nThere is no standard English translation for either Daoist \"chu\" (å», Kitchen) or \"xingchu\" (è¡å», Mobile Kitchen). The former is rendered as:\nThese Anglophone scholars render Chinese \"chu\" as either English \"kitchen\" (\"a room for preparing food\"), optionally clarified with \"K-\", -\"festival\" or -\"feast\", or \"cusine\" (\"a characteristic style of cooking, often associated with a place of origin\"). The latter follows Francophone sinologists, for instance Maspero (1971) and Mollier (1999), who accurately translated Chinese \"chu\" as French \"cuisine\" (\"kitchen; cooking\") and \"xingchu\" as \"cusine de voyage\" (\"travel kitchen\"). Although English \"kitchen\" and French \"cuisine\" are doublets deriving from Latin \"cocÄ«na\" (\"cooking; kitchen\"), they are false friends with significant semantic differences between English \"kitchen\" and \"cuisine\". Chinese usually translates English \"kitchen\" as chÃºfÃ¡ng (å»æ¿, \"kitchen\") and \"cuisine\" as \"pÄngrÃ¨n\" (ç¹é£ª, \"art of cooking\").\nThe term \"xingchu\" (è¡å») has been translated as\nJoseph Needham calls Ware's \"Traveling Canteen\" a \"bizarre translation\" (1976: 29). While Maspero uniquely interprets the \"xing\" (è¡) in \"xingchu\" as a verb (\"to perform\"), the other scholars read it as a modifier (\"to go; to move\") translated as \"traveling\", \"mobile\", or \"movable\" (cf. \"movable feast\"). The \"chu\" noun in \"xingchu\" is translated as English \"kitchen\", \"cuisine\", or \"canteen\". However, the latter ambiguous word has several meanings besides \"canteen\" (\"a cafeteria or snack bar provided by an organization\"), \"canteen\" (\"a small water bottle\"), and British English \"canteen\" (\"a case or box containing a cutlery set\"). To further complicate translating \"xingchu\", \"travelling canteen\" was the 18th-century equivalent of a picnic basket. In modern terms, the \"xingchu\" is comparable with a mobile kitchen (Sivin's translation), military field kitchen, food truck, or food cart.\n\nThe \"chu\" (å», Kitchen), also known as \"fushi\" (ç¦é£, \"good luck meal\"), was a religious banquet that usually involved preliminary fasting and purification before consuming a meal of vegetarian food and Chinese wine. The banquet was hosted by families on the occasion of births and deaths, prepared for a ritually-fixed number of parishioners, and accompanied by specific ritual gifts to the Daoist priest. Although the Kitchen Feast became a regular element of organized Daoist religious traditions, scholars do not know the date when it was introduced into the liturgy. One early textual record is the c. 499 \"Zhen'gao\" saying that Xu Mi (è¨±è°§, 303-376) offered a Kitchen meal to five persons (Stein 1979: 57). \n\nThese communal \"chu\" Kitchen banquets have a pre-Daoist antecedent in popular Chinese folk religion: the term \"chu\" was anciently used for the ceremonial meals organized by communities to honor the \"she\" (ç¤¾, God of the Soil). Although orthodox Daoists criticized, and sometimes banned, these \"chuhui\" (å»æ, \"cuisine congregations\") for making immoral animal sacrifices, they nevertheless perpetuated the custom by adapting and codifying it (Mollier 2008a: 279). \"Chu\" kitchen-feasts have many features in common with another Daoist ritual meal, the \"zhÄi\" (é½, \"fast; purification; retreat\"), and the two are frequently treated as having the same functions. The 7th-century Daoist \"Zhaijielu\" (é½æé, Records of Fasting) suggested that \"zhai\" were anciently called \"shehui\" (ç¤¾æ, \"festival gatherings of the soil god\"ânow the modern Chinese word for \"society\"), which was later changed into \"zhaihui\" (é½æ) (Stein 1979: 75).\nThe Way of the Celestial Masters religion, founded by Zhang Daoling in 142 CE, celebrated \"chu\" kitchen festivals at New Year and the annual \"sanhui\" (ä¸æ, Three Assemblies), which were major Daoist festivals held in the first, seventh, and tenth lunar months, when believers assembled at their local parish to report any births, deaths, or marriages, so that the population registers could be updated. Parishioners who had reason to celebrate on these occasions would host a \"chu\" feast for other members of the community in proportion to the significance of their auspicious event and their means. Accounts of these banquets \"emphasize both the sharing of food and the affirmation of the unique, religious merit-based social order of the Daoist community\" (Kleeman 2008: 839-840).\n\nThe \"chu\" sacrament had three levels of banquets and ritual gifts, depending upon what the family was celebrating. For the birth of a boy, the \"shangchu\" (ä¸å», Superior Ceremony of the Kitchen) was a banquet offered to the priest and ten members of the parish, with gifts to the priest of a hundred sheets of paper, a pair of ink brushes, an inkstick, and an ink scraper. For the birth of a girl, it was the less expensive \"zhongchu\" (ä¸­å», Middle Ceremony of the Kitchen) with a banquet for five parishioners, and the gifts, which the parents had to provide within one month following the birth, were a mat, a wastebasket, and a broom. For the death of a family member, the \"xiachu\" (ä¸å», Inferior Ceremony of the Kitchen), also called \"jiechu\" (è§£å», Kitchen of Deliverance), is not described in Daoist texts, and we only know that the rival Buddhist polemicists claimed it was a \"great orgy\" (Maspero 1981: 290). \n\nThe anti-Daoist \"Erjiaolun\" (äºæè«, Essay on Two Religions) by the Buddhist monk Dao'an (312â385) said \"chu\" kitchen-feasts were intended to bring about \"jiÄchÃº\" (è§£é¤, \"liberation and elimination\") from pollution and sins, which were connected with the soil god and tombs (Stein 1979: 71). The parallel passage in the 6th-century \"Bianhuolun\" (è¾¯æè«, Essay on Debating Doubts) uses the homophonous graphic variant of \"jiÄchÃº\" (è§£å», \"liberation kitchen\"), thus connecting both \"chÃº\" \"kitchen\" and \"chÃº\" \"liberation\" to non-Daoist gods of the soil (Stein 1979: 74).\n\nDaoist sources record that the people invited to a \"chu\" Kitchen feast would first observe a period of purification that included fasting and abstention from sex. Kitchen rituals lasted for one, three, or seven days. Participants consumed exclusively vegetarian food and moderate amounts of wine, which was considered as a mandatory element of the banquet (Mollier 2008a: 279). For the Superior Kitchens five \"sheng\" of wine (about a liter) per person was planned, for the Middle Kitchens, four \"sheng\", and for the Inferior Kitchen three. The participants \"must have departed a bit happy, but not drunk.\" (Maspero 1981: 290). The leftovers were given to other parishioners who could thereby share in the ritual. \n\nBesides annual festivals on fixed dates like the Three Assemblies, \"chu\" Kitchen ceremonies were also performed in special circumstances, particularly when there was disease, sin, or death pollution. They were believed to have exorcistic and salvific powers and to confer good luck or merit upon the adepts (Mollier 2008a: 279). Kitchen ceremonies often involved Daoist ritual \"jiao\" (é®, \"offerings\") of cakes and pieces of fabric in order to obtain particular favors, such as petitions for recovery from illnesses, prayers for rain in time of drought, and thanksgivings for favors received. An altar was laid out in the open air, and the priest recited prayers (Maspero 1981: 34-35).\n\nGe Hong's c. 318 \"Baopuzi\" (see below) mentions profligately expensive \"chu\" Kitchen Feasts in contrasting heterodox \"yaodao\" (å¦é, \"demonic cults\"), which involved sacrificing animals to gods who enjoyed their blood, with the undefined term \"Lijia dao\" (æå®¶é, \"religion of the adepts of Li\") (Stein 1979: 56). The context praises the contemporary charlatan healer Li Kuan (æå¯¬) for not following the ancient tradition of animal sacrifice, while blaming him for extravagance. \nThe more than a hundred ways for dealing with demons [è«¸å¦éç¾é¤ç¨®] all call for slaying living creatures so that their blood may be drunk. Only the doctrine of the Lis [æå®¶é] is slightly different. Yet, though it does no butchering, whenever its \"good-luck food\" is served [æ¯ä¾ç¦é£], it includes varieties of mixtures without limit. In planning the meal, one strives for sumptuousness, and the rarest things must be purchased. Several dozen may work in the kitchen [ææ¸åäººå»], and costs for food can run high indeed. In tum, these are not completely disinterested affairs, and they might well be classed with things to be forbidden. (tr. Ware 1966: 158) \n\nIn Daoist hagiographies and stories, the esoteric ability to summon a \"xingchu\" (è¡å», Mobile Kitchen) was a standard trope for the powers of a \"xian\" transcendent. The \"xingchu\", which Campany called a \"curious business\" (2002: 29), was a sumptuous banquet of rare delicacies, exotic foods, and wines that could be instantly served up by spirits anywhere on command.\n\nThe tradition of \"xingchu\" \"meditational cuisines\" or \"contemplative cuisines\" seems to have developed in a parallel and complementary manner to the \"chu\" \"communal cuisine liturgy\" (Mollier 2008a: 280). \"Xian\" transcendents were portrayed as eschewing what counted in China as ordinary foods, especially grains (see \"bigu\"), and instead eating superior, longevity-inducing substitutes such as sesame seeds and \"lingzhi\" mushrooms, typically found in distant and legendary places removed from the heartland of agriculture-based Chinese civilization. Transcendents were frequently depicted as winged beings able to fly long distances rapidly and summoning a \"xingchu\" banquet at will eliminated the need to travel across the world and heavens in order to obtain rare foodstuffs of immortality (Campany 2005: 46-47).\n\nThe Jin Dynasty Daoist scholar Ge Hong compiled the two primary sources of information about \"xingchu\" Mobile Kitchens, the \"Baopuzi\" and \"Shenxian zhuan\". Ge portrayed adepts seeking \"xian\"-hood as avoiding ordinary food such as grains, instead eating \"rare, exotic foodstuffs from the far reaches of the cosmos\", marvelous products conveying the \"numinous power\" suggested by their peculiarity. \"The ability to command at will a spirit-hosted serving of exotic food and drink in elegant vessels may seem trivial, but when one recalls that many Daoist scriptures prohibit the feasting on sacrificial meats and liquors enjoyed by the aristocracy, and that many adepts did their work on mountains and were isolated from agricultural communities and markets, the practice assumes a more serious aspect.\" (Campany 2002: 221)\n\nThe c. 318 CE \"Inner Chapters\" of the \"Baopuzi\" (Master Who Embraces Simplicity) have nine occurrences of the word \"xingchu\" (è¡å», Mobile Kitchen). Seven of them are in contexts of alchemical medicines and elixirs, most of which have poisonous toxic heavy metal ingredients. The \"Baopuzi\" uses two related verbs for beckoning a Mobile Kitchen: \"zhÃ¬\" (è³, \"arrive at; reach; come\") and \"zhÃ¬\" (è´, \"cause to arrive at; get to; come to\"). The other two \"xingchu\" usages are in proper names of a Daoist amulet and book, the \"Xingchu fu\" (è¡å»ç¬¦, Amulet of the Traveling Kitchen), and the \"Xingchu jing\" (è¡å»ç¶, Scripture of the Traveling Kitchen). The \"Baopuzi\" also lists another book titled \"Riyue chushi jing\" (æ¥æå»é£ç¶, Scripture of the Kitchen Meals of the Sun and the Moon) (19, Ware 1966: 384, 380, 381).\n\nThree of the seven \"Baopuzi\" elixirs are said to have dual purpose usages, long-term consumption is said to grant \"xian\" transcendence, including the ability to summon \"xingchu\", and short-term consumption provides a panaceaâspecifically for eliminating the Three Corpses or Three Worms, demons that live within the human body and hasten their host's death, and the Nine Worms or Nine Vermin, broadly meaning internal worms and parasites. First, the \"Xian Menzi dan\" (ç¾¡éå­ä¸¹, Master Xian Men's Elixir) is prepared from wine and cinnabar. \"After it has been taken for one day the Three Worms and all illnesses are immediately purged from the patient. If taken for three years, it will confer geniehood and one is sure to be served by two fairies, who can be employed to summon the Traveling Canteen [å¯å½¹ä½¿è´è¡å»].\" (4, tr. Ware 1966: 84; cf. Campany 2002: 290). Second, a list of methods for eating and drinking realgar says, \"In each case it confers Fullness of Life; all illnesses are banished; the Three Corpses drop from the body; scars disappear; gray hair tums black; and lost teeth are regenerated. After a thousand days, fairies [translating \"yunu\" çå¥³ Jade Maiden] will come to serve you and you can use them to summon the Traveling Canteen [ä»¥è´è¡å»].\" (11, tr. Ware 1966: 188). Third, consuming pure, unadulterated lacquer will put a man in communication with the gods and let him Enjoy Fullness of Life. When eaten with pieces of crab in mica or jade water, \"The Nine Insects will then drop from you, and the bad blood will leave you through nose-bleeds. After a year, the six-\"chia\" gods and the Traveling Canteen will come to you [ä¸å¹´å­ç²è¡å»è³ä¹].\" (11, tr. Ware 1966: 190). This \"liujia\" (å­ç², Six \"Jia\" Gods) and the \"liuyin\" (å­é°, Six Yin) below refer to astrological Dunjia divination. An alternate translation is \"the six \"jia\" and the traveling canteen will arrive\" (Campany 2002: 75),\n\nThe remaining four \"Baopuzi\" formulas are said to create stronger and more versatile elixirs. Fourth, the \"Jiuguang dan\" (ä¹åä¸¹, Ninefold Radiance Elixir) is made by processing certain unspecified ingredients with the \"wushi\" (äºç³, Five Minerals, see Cold-Food Powder), i.e., cinnabar, realgar, purified potassium alum, laminar malachite, and magnetite (Needham et al. 1976: 86). Each mineral is put through five alchemical cycles and assumes five hues, so that altogether twenty-five hues result, each with specific powers, for example, the blue elixir will revive a recently deceased person. \"If you wish to summon the Traveling Canteen [æ¬²è´è¡å»], smear your left hand with a solution of black elixir; whatever you ask for will be at your beck and call, and everything you mention will arrive without effort. You will be able to summon any thing or any creature in the world.\" (tr. Ware 1966: 82-83, noting \"fragrant foods served in plates of gold and cups of jade\"). Fifth, the \"Baopuzi\" quotes from \"Shennong sijing\" (ç¥è¾²åç¶, Shennong's Four Classics), \"Medicines of the highest type put the human body at ease and protract life so that people ascend and become gods in heaven, soar up and down in the air, and have all the spirits at their service. Their bodies grow feathers and wings, and the Traveling Canteen comes whenever they wish [è¡å»ç«è³].\" (11, tr. Ware 1966: 177). Sixth, the method of Wu Chengzi (åæå­) compounds alchemical gold from realgar, yellow sand, and mercury, and then forms it into small pills. Coating the pills with different substances will produce magical effects, for instance, if one is smeared with ram's blood and thrown into a stream, \"the fish and the dragons will come out immediately, and it will be easy to catch them.\" And, \"If it is coated with hare's blood and placed in a spot belonging to the Six Yin, the Traveling Canteen and the fairies will appear immediately and place themselves at your disposal [è¡å»çå¥³ç«è³], to a total of sixty or seventy individuals.\" (16, tr. Ware 1966: 276). Seventh, Liu Gen (åæ ¹, or Liu Jun'an ååå®), who Ware wrongly identifies as the Daoist prince and author Liu An (åå®, Campany 2002: 248), learned the art of metamorphosis from an alchemical text attributed to the Mohist founder Mozi, the \"Mozi wuxing ji\" (å¢¨å­äºè¡è¨, Master Mo's Records of the Five Phases), and successfully used its medicines and amulets, \"By grasping a pole he becomes a tree. He plants something, and it immediately produces edible melons or fruit. He draws a line on the ground, and it becomes a river; he piles up dirt and it becomes a hill. He sits down and causes the Traveling Canteen to arrive [åè´è¡å»].\" (19, tr. Ware 1966: 316).\n\nThe c. 318 \"Shenxian zhuan\" (Hagiographies of Divine Transcendents) uses \"xingchu\" (è¡å», Mobile Kitchen) six times. The hagiography of Wang Yuan gives a detailed description of summoning a \"xingchu\". Other adepts who are also said to have this ability include Li Gen, Liu Jing, Zuo Ci, Liu Zheng, and Taixuan nÃ¼ (Campany 2002: 222).\nFirst, the hagiography of Wang Yuan (çé ) and Magu (Cannabis Maiden) says Wang was a Confucianist scholar who quit his official post during the reign (146-168 CE) of Emperor Huan of Han and went into the mountains to study Daoist techniques. Wang achieved \"xian\" transcendence through \"shijie\" \"liberation by means of a simulated corpse\", described with the traditional cicada metaphor, his \"body disappeared; yet the cap and garments were completely undisturbed, like a cicada shell.\" During his travels, Wang met the peasant Cai Jing (è¡ç¶), whose physiognomy indicated he was destined to become a transcendent, so Wang took him on as a disciple, taught him the basic techniques, and left. Soon afterwards Cai also used alchemical \"shijie\" liberation, his body became extremely hot, and his flesh and bones melted away for three days. \"Suddenly he had vanished. When his family looked inside the blanket, only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell.\" (tr. Campany 2002: 260).\n\nAfter Cai had been gone for \"over a decade\", he unexpectedly returned home, looking like a young man, announced to his family that Lord Wang would visit on the \"seventh day of the seventh month\" (later associated with the Cowherd and Weaver Girl lovers' festival), and ordered them to \"prepare great quantities of food and drink to offer to his attendants.\" When Wang Yuan and his heavenly entourage arrived on the auspicious \"double-seven\" day, he invited his old friend Magu to join their celebration because it had been over five hundred years since she had been \"in the human realm.\" When the Cannabis Maiden and her attendants arrived at Cai's household,\nShe appeared to be a handsome woman of eighteen or nineteen; her hair was done up, and several loose strands hung down to her waist. Her gown had a pattern of colors, but it was not woven; it shimmered, dazzling the eyes, and was indescribable â it was not of this world. She approached and bowed to Wang, who bade her rise. When they were both seated, they called for the travelling canteen [åå®å¬é²è¡å»]. The servings were piled up on gold platters and in jade cups without limit. There were rare delicacies, many of them made from flowers and fruits, and their fragrance permeated the air inside [Cai's home] and out. When the meat was sliced and served, [in flavor] it resembled broiled \"mo\" and was announced as \"kirin\" meat. (tr. Campany 2002: 262) \nCompare Maspero's translation, \"everyone steps forth to 'perform the Kitchen'\" (1981: 291). Guo Pu's commentary to the \"Classic of Mountains and Seas\" described the \"mÃ²\" (è², giant panda) as \"bear-like, black and white, and metal-eating\" (tr. Harper 2013: 216); and the mystical \"qilin\" beast is sometimes identified as a Chinese unicorn (Penny 2008: 731).\n\nWang Yuan then announced to the Cai family that he had brought some exceptional wine from the Tianchu (å¤©å», Heavenly Kitchen) asterism.\nI wish to present you all with a gift of fine liquor. This liquor has just been produced by the celestial kitchens. Its flavor is quite strong, so it is unfit for drinking by ordinary people; in fact, in some cases it has been known to burn people's intestines. You should mix it with water, and you should not regard this as inappropriate.\" With that, he added a \"dou\" of water to a \"sheng\" of liquor, stirred it, and presented it to the members of Cai Jing's family. On drinking little more than a \"sheng\" of it each, they were all intoxicated. After a little while, the liquor was all gone. (tr. Campany 2002: 263) \nIn traditional Chinese units of measurement , a \"dÇu\" (æ) was approximately equivalent to 10 liters and a \"shÄng\" å) approximately 1 liter. \n\nSecond, the \"Shenxian zhuan\" narrative of Li Gen (ææ ¹) says he studied under Wu Dawen (å³å¤§æ) and obtained a method for producing alchemical gold and silver.\nLi Gen could transform himself [into other forms] and could enter water and fire [without harm]. He could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive, and with it could serve twenty guests [åè´è¡å»è½ä¾äºåäºº]. All the dishes were finely prepared, and all of them contained strange and marvelous foods from the four directions, not things that were locally available. (tr. Campany 2002: 219) \n\nThird, Liu Jing (åäº¬) was an official under Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180-157 BCE) who \"abandoned the world and followed Lord Zhang å¼µå of Handan to study the Way.\" By using methods for subsisting on \"efflorescence of vermilion\" pills [æ±è±ä¸¸] and \"cloud-mother [mica]\" pills, Liu \"lived to be one hundred thirty years old. To look at him, one would judge him to be a person in his thirties.\" He could also foretell the auspiciousness of future events. (tr. Campany 2002: 249).\n\nThe Shangqing (Supreme Purity) tradition \"Han Wu Di neizhuan\" (æ¼¢æ­¦å¸åå³, Esoteric Traditions of Han Emperor Wu), which was written between 370 and 500, has some later accretions that resemble \"Shenxian zhuan\" (Campany 2002: 76). The passage about Liu Jing says,\nLater he served Ji Zixun [èå­è¨, i.e., Ji Liao èé¼] as his teacher. Zixun transmitted to him all the secret essentials of the Five Thearchs, Numinous Flight (\"lingfei\", éé£), the six \"jia\" spirits, the Twelve Matters (\"shier shi\" åäºäº), and the Perfected Forms of the Ten Continents of Divine Transcendents (shenxian shizhou zhenxiang ç¥ä»åæ´²çå½¢). Liu Jing practiced them all according to the instructions, and they were mightily efficacious. He could summon ghosts and spirits, immediately cause wind and rain to arise, cause the traveling canteen to arrive [åè´è¡å»], and appear and disappear at will. He also knew the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of people's future affairs and of particular days. (tr. Campany 2002: 449) \n\nFourth, the transcendent Zuo Ci (å·¦æ) was a \"fangshi\" (\"method master\") famous for his abilities at divination, \"fenshen\" multilocation, and shapeshifting (Pregadio 2008: 1305),\nSeeing that the fortunes of the Han house were about to decline, he sighed and said, \"As we move into this declining [astral] configuration, those who hold eminent offices are in peril, and those of lofty talent will die. Winning glory in this present age is not something to be coveted.\" So he studied arts of the Dao. He understood particularly well [how to summon] the six \"jia\" spirits, how to dispatch ghosts and other spirits, and how to sit down and call for the traveling canteen [åè´è¡å»]. (tr. Campany 2002: 279) \n\nFifth, the \"Shenxian zhuan\" says that Liu Zheng (åæ¿) used the same alchemical text attributed to Mozi that the \"Baopuzi\" says was used by Liu Gen (åæ ¹, or Liu Jun'an ååå®, see Campany 2002: 240-249).\nLater he arranged [a copy of] Master Mo's Treatise on the Five Phases (\"Mozi wuxing ji\" å¢¨å­äºè¡è¨) and, [based on it], ingested \"efflorescence of vermilion\" pills. He lived for more than one hundred eighty years, and his complexion was that of a youth. He could transform himself into other shapes and conceal his form; multiply one person into a hundred or a hundred into a thousand or a thousand into ten thousand; conceal a military force of three brigades by forming them into a forest or into birds and beasts, so that they could easily take their opponents' weapons without their knowledge. Further, he was capable of planting fruits of all types and causing them immediately to flower and ripen so as to be ready to eat. He could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive [çè´è¡å»], setting out a complete meal for up to several hundred people. His mere whistling could create a wind to set dust swirling and blow stones about. (tr. Campany 2002: 322) \nTranscendental whistling was an ancient Daoist yogic technique.\n\nSixth, the brief hagiography of the female transcendent Taixuan nÃ¼ (å¤ªçå¥³, Woman of the Grand Mystery) says.\nThe Woman of the Grand Mystery was surnamed Zhuan é¡ and named He å. While still young, she was bereaved of her husband, so she practiced the Way. Disciplining herself in the arts of the Jade Master, (Yuzi) she could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive [åè´è¡å»], and there was no sort of transformation she could not accomplish. (tr. Campany 2002: 367). \n\nIn addition, the \"Shenxian zhuan\" hagiography for Mao Ying (èç) describes what sounds like a \"xingchu\" without using the name (Campany 2002: 328). After twenty years studying the Dao, Mao Ying returned home to his parents and announced that he had been commanded to enter heaven and become a transcendent. The people of his home village came to give him a going-away party, and Mao said,\n\"I am touched by your sincere willingness to send me off, and I deeply appreciate your intention. But please come empty-handed; you need not make any expenditure. I have a means whereby to provide a feast for us all.\" On the appointed day, the guests all arrived, and a great banquet was held. Awnings of blue brocade were spread out, and layers of white felt were spread out beneath them. Rare delicacies and strange fruits were piled up and arrayed. Female entertainers provided music; the sounds of metal and stone mingled together, and the din shook Heaven and Earth; it could be heard from several \"li\" away. Of the more than one thousand guests present that day, none failed to leave intoxicated and sated. (tr. Campany 2002: 327) \nMao Ying and his brothers Mao Gu (èåº) and Mao Zhong (èè¡·) are considered of the founders of the Shangqing School of Daoism.\n\nShangqing Daoists took the stock literary phrase \"zuo zhi xingchu\" (åè´è¡å»)âused above in the \"Baopuzi\" for Liu Gen, \"sits down and causes the Traveling Canteen to arrive\" (tr. Ware), and in the \"Shenxian zhuan\" for Li Gen, Zuo Ci, and Taixuan nÃ¼, \"sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive\" (tr. Campany)âand actualized it as a visualization technique for \"making the movable cuisines come [while] sitting [in meditation]\" (tr. Mollier). \"This method, accessible only to the initiate who possessed the proper series of talismans (\"fu\" ç¬¦) and had mastered certain visualization techniques, conferred powers to become invisible, to cause thunder, and to call for rain.\" This form of sitting meditation was so popular during the Tang period that Chinese Esoteric Buddhism also adopted it. (Mollier 2008a: 280)\n\nFollowing upon the Celestial Masters liturgical Kitchen feasts and \"xian\" transcendents' Mobile Kitchens, the third stage of Daoist \"chu\" traditions was the Tang dynasty (618â907) \"wÇchÃº\" (äºå», Five Kitchens) contemplation technique, which recast the concept of ritual banquets in terms of psychophysiological \"neidan\" Internal Alchemy (Verellen 2004: 351). In Chinese cosmological wuxing Five Phases correspondence theory, the \"wuchu\" Five Kitchens or \"wuzang\" (äºè, Five Viscera / Orbs) system includes not only the physiological internal organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and spleen), but also the associated psychological range of mental and emotional states (Roth 1999: 41-42). The 735 \"Wuchu jing\" (äºå»ç¶, Scripture of the Five Kitchens), which poetically describes a visualization practice for circulating \"qi\" energies through the Five Viscera, was so popular that Tang Buddhists forged the esoteric \"SÄnchÃº jÄ«ng\" (ä¸å»ç¶, Sutra of the Three Kitchens) based on the Daoist text (Mollier 2008b: 1051).\n\nThere are two extant editions of \"Wuchu jing\" (translated by Kohn 2010: 198-206). First, the 763 Tang \"Daozang\" (Daoist Canon) edition titled \"Laozi shuo Wuchu jing zhu\" (èå­èªªäºå»ç¶, Commentary to the Scripture of the Five Kitchens as Revealed by Laozi) contains a preface dated 735 and a commentary, both signed by Yin Yin (å°¹æ, d. 741). The reduplicatedly named Yin Yin was a prominent Daoist and Confucian scholar under Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (r. 712-756), and abbot of the Suming guan (èæè§, Abbey of Reviving Light) temple in the capital Chang'an. The late Tang Celestial Master Zhao Xianfu (è¶ä»ç«, fl. 732) also wrote a commentary (Verellen 2004: 351). Second, the 1019 \"Yunji Qiqian\" (Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel) anthology edition titled \"Wuchu jing qifa\" (äºå»ç¶æ°£æ³, Energetic Methods of the Scripture of the Five Kitchens), also includes Yin's commentary, with slight variations, such as noting the text was presented to the emperor in 736 (Verellen 2004: 351). The \"qi\" \"energetic\" methods of the text are recommended by Sima Chengzhen (å¸é¦¬æ¿ç¦, 647â735) in his \"Fuqi jingyi lun\" (ææ°£ç²¾ç¾©è«, Essay on the Essential Meaning of Breath Ingestion) text on physical self-cultivation (Mollier 2008b: 1051). Although the presence of Yin's preface might suggest a Tang date for the \"Wuchu jing\", the origins of this text may be much earlier. Ge Hong's c. 318 \"Baopuzi\" mentions a \"Xingchu jing\" (è¡å»ç¶, Scripture of the Movable Kitchens) and a \"Riyue chushi jing\" (æ¥æå»é£ç¶, Scripture of the Kitchen Meals for the Sun and the Moon), which could be the ancestors of the received texts (Mollier 2008b: 1051). \n\nThe c. 905 \"Daojiao lingyan ji\" (éæéé©è¨, Record of Daoist Miracles, written by the Daoist priest, author, and court official Du Guangting, says a Buddhist monk fraudulently transformed the \"Wuchu jing\" Scripture of the Five Kitchens into the \"Sanchu jing\" (ä¸å»ç¶, Sutra of the Three Kitchens). Du records that the Chinese Buddhist canon of the Tang period contained a text titled \"Fo shuo san tingchu jing\" (ä½èªªä¸åå»ç¶, Sutra of the Three Interrupted Kitchens, Preached by the Buddha) (Verellen I992: 248-249). According to Du Guangting, the monk Xingduan (è¡ç«¯), who had \"a presumptuous and fraudulent disposition\", saw that the widely-circulated Daoist \"Wuchu jing\" consisted of five stanzas (\"jÃ¬\" å, \"\"gatha\"; poetic verse; versified utterance\") of incantations (\"zhÃ²u\" å, \"\"mantra\"; religious incantation; mystical invocation\"), rearranged them, and expanded the title into \"Fo shuo san tingchu jing\" (ä½èªªä¸åå»ç¶). \"The five incantations he turned into 'five sutras spoken by Tathagata,' and at the end he added a hymn. The additional phrases amounted to no less than a page.\" Verellen suggests that the scripture, with its \"Buddho-Daoist content and quasi-magical use\", originated as a late Six Dynasties (220-589) Tantric \"zhoujing\" (åç¶, \"incantations scripture\", cf. the \"Divine Incantations Scripture\"). (1992: 250-51).\n\nDu Guangting gives a lengthy narrative about the Daoist miracle involving supernatural retribution for Xingduan's forgery. One day after the monk had already given several copies of the altered scripture to others, a \"divine being eight or nine feet tall\" and holding a sword reprimands him for the counterfeiting and brandishes his sword to strike the monk. As Xingduan \"wards off the blow with his hand, several fingers are lopped off\", he begs for mercy, and the Daoist deity agrees to spare his life if he retrieves and destroys all the fakes. Xingduan and his companions search everywhere for the texts, but can only find half of them, the remainder having already been carried abroad by Buddhist monks. Xingduan prepares ten fresh copies of the original scripture, offers incense, repents, and burns the altered copies. Then the divine being reappears and announces: \"Having vilified the sage's text, restitution won't save youâyou do not deserve to escape death\", the monk falls prostrate and dies on the spot (Verellen 1992: 251). \n\nIn the present day, early copies of this apocryphal Buddhist sutra have been preserved. Four textual versions were discovered in the Chinese Dunhuang manuscripts, two versions, dated 1099 and 1270, are kept in the Japanese Mount KÅya manuscripts. In addition, the modern Japanese TaishÅ Tripiá¹­aka canon includes the text (Mollier 2009: 26-28).\n\nThe highly abstract \"Wuchu jing\" mystical poem comprises five stanzas consisting of four five-character lines each. The \"Yunqi qiqian\" edition shows that the five stanzas were associated with the Five Directions of space: east (lines 1-4), south (lines 5-8), north (lines 9-12), west (lines 13-16), and center (lines 17-20) (Verellen 2004: 351). For example, the first four lines (tr. Kohn 2010: 200-201):\nThe content of the \"Wuchu jing\" guides adepts toward a detached mental state of non-thinking and equanimity. The Five Kitchens refer to \"neidan\" Internal Alchemy \"\"qi\"-processing on a subtle-body level\", and signify the energetic, transformative power of the Five Viscera (Kohn 2010: 71). Yin Yin's introduction says,\nAs long as you dwell in the \"qi\" of universal oneness [ä¸æ°£] and in the harmony of cosmic peace [æ³°å], the five organs [äºè] are abundant and full and the five spirits [äºç¥] are still and upright. \"When the five organs are abundant, all sensory experiences are satisfied; when the five spirits are still, all cravings and desires are eliminated. This scripture expounds on how the five organs taking in \"qi\" is like someone looking for food in a kitchen. Thus, its title: \"Scripture of the Five Kitchens.\" (tr. Kohn 2010: 200) \nCommenting on Yin's interpretation, Du Guangting claims more explicitly that practicing this scripture will enable an adept to stop eating. (Verellen 2004: 352)\n\nTechniques in the \"Wuchu jing\" (äºå»ç¶, Scripture of the Five Kitchens) mainly involve visualizing the Five Viscera of the body and chanting incantations. These methods supposedly allow the adept to obtain satisfaction and harmony, and, after some years of training, even transcendence (Mollier 2008a: 279-280). Despite this concern with the human body, the text strongly emphasizes mental restructuring over physical practices, saying that \"accumulating cultivation will not get you to detachment\" and that methods of ingestion are ultimately useless. However, reciting the scripture is beneficial, especially if combined with mental and ethical practices, so that \"you will easily get the true essentials of cultivating the body-self and protecting life.\" More specifically, chanting the text one hundred times and practicing the harmonization of the five \"qi\" allows adepts to abstain from grain and eliminate hunger (Mollier 1999: 62-63). Many present-day Daoists consider the \"Wuchu jing\" as a talismanic text to be chanted for protection (Kohn 2010: 71).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40626908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40626908", "title": "Classical Marxism", "text": "Classical Marxism\n\nClassical Marxism refers to the economic, philosophical and sociological theories expounded by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels as contrasted with later developments in Marxism, especially Leninism and MarxismâLeninism.\n\nKarl Heinrich Marx (May 5, 1818, Trier, Germany â March 14, 1883, London) was an immensely influential German philosopher, sociologist, political economist and revolutionary socialist. Marx addressed a wide range of issues, including alienation and exploitation of the worker, the capitalist mode of production and historical materialism, although he is most famous for his analysis of history in terms of class struggles, summed up in the opening line of the introduction to \"The Communist Manifesto\": \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\". The influence of his ideas, already popular during his life, was given added impetus by the victory of the Russian Bolsheviks in the 1917 October Revolution and there are few parts of the world which were not significantly touched by Marxian ideas in the course of the twentieth century.\n\nAs the American Marx scholar Hal Draper remarked: \"[T]here are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike\".\n\nThe early influences on Marx are often grouped into three categories: German philosophy, English/Scottish political economy and French socialism.\n\nMain influences include Immanuel Kant; G. W. F. Hegel; and Ludwig Feuerbach. \n\nMarx studied under one of Hegel's pupils, Bruno Bauer, a leader of the circle of Young Hegelians to whom Marx attached himself. However, from 1841 he and Engels came to disagree with Bauer and the rest of the Young Hegelians about socialism and also about the usage of Hegel's dialectic and progressively broke away from German idealism and the Young Hegelians. Marx's early writings are thus a response towards Hegel, German idealism and a break with the rest of the Young Hegelians. Marx, \"stood Hegel on his head\", in his own view of his role by turning the idealistic dialectic into a materialistic one, in proposing that material circumstances shape ideas instead of the other way around. In this, Marx was following the lead of Feuerbach. His theory of alienation, developed in the \"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844\" (published in 1932), inspired itself from Feuerbach's critique of the alienation of Man in God through the objectivation of all his inherent characteristics (thus man projected on God all qualities which are in fact man's own quality which defines the \"human nature\"). But Marx also criticized Feuerbach for being insufficiently materialistic.\n\nMain influences include Adam Smith and David Ricardo. \n\nMarx built on and critiqued the most well-known political economists of his day, the British classical political economists.\n\nMarx critiqued Smith and Ricardo for not realizing that their economic concepts reflected specifically capitalist institutions, not innate natural properties of human society and could not be applied unchanged to all societies. He proposed a systematic correlation between labour-values and money prices. He claimed that the source of profits under capitalism is value added by workers not paid out in wages. This mechanism operated through the distinction between \"labour power\", which workers freely exchanged for their wages; and \"labour\", over which asset-holding capitalists thereby gained control. This practical and theoretical distinction was Marx's primary insight, and allowed him to develop the concept of \"surplus value\", which distinguished his works from that of Smith and Ricardo.\n\nMain influences include Jean-Jacques Rousseau; Charles Fourier; Henri de Saint-Simon; Pierre-Joseph Proudhon; and Louis Blanc.\n\nRousseau was one of the first modern writers to seriously attack the institution of private property and therefore is sometimes considered a forebear of modern socialism and communism, though Marx rarely mentions Rousseau in his writings.\n\nIn 1833, France was experiencing a number of social problems arising out of the Industrial Revolution. A number of sweeping plans of reform were developed by thinkers on the political left. Among the more grandiose were the plans of Charles Fourier and the followers of Saint-Simon. Fourier wanted to replace modern cities with utopian communities while the Saint-Simonians advocated directing the economy by manipulating credit. Although these programs did not have much support, they did expand the political and social imagination of Marx.\n\nLouis Blanc is perhaps best known for originating the social principle, later adopted by Marx, of how labor and income should be distributed: âFrom each according to his abilities, to each according to his needsâ.\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon participated in the February 1848 uprising and the composition of what he termed \"the first republican proclamation\" of the new republic, but he had misgivings about the new government because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of the socio-economic reform, which Proudhon considered basic. Proudhon published his own perspective for reform, \"Solution du problÃ¨me social\", in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from capitalists and financiers to workers. It was Proudhon's book \"What Is Property?\" that convinced the young Karl Marx that private property should be abolished.\n\nMain influences includes Friedrich Engels; ancient Greek materialism; Giambattista Vico; and Lewis H. Morgan.\n\nMarx's revision of Hegelianism was also influenced by Engels' book \"The Condition of the Working Class in England\" in 1844, which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.\n\nMarx was influenced by Antique materialism, especially Epicurus (to whom Marx dedicated his thesis, \"The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature\", 1841) for his materialism and theory of clinamen which opened up a realm of liberty.\n\nGiambattista Vico propounded a cyclical theory of history, according to which human societies progress through a series of stages from barbarism to civilization and then return to barbarism. In the first stageâcalled the Age of the Godsâreligion, the family and other basic institutions emerge; in the succeeding Age of Heroes, the common people are kept in subjection by a dominant class of nobles; in the final stageâthe Age of Menâthe people rebel and win equality, but in the process society begins to disintegrate. Vico's influence on Marx is obvious.\n\nMarx drew on Lewis H. Morgan and his social evolution theory. He wrote a collection of notebooks from his reading of Lewis Morgan, but they are regarded as being quite obscure and only available in scholarly editions. (However Engels is much more noticeably influenced by Morgan than Marx).\n\nFriedrich Engels (November 28, 1820, Wuppertal â August 5, 1895, London) was a nineteenth-century German political philosopher. He developed communist theory alongside his better-known collaborator, Karl Marx.\n\nIn 1842, his father sent the young Engels to England to help manage his cotton factory in Manchester. Shocked by the widespread poverty, Engels began writing an account which he published in 1845 as \"The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844\" ().\n\nIn July 1845, Engels went to England, where he met an Irish working-class woman named Mary Burns (Crosby), with whom he lived until her death in 1863 (Carver 2003:19). Later, Engels lived with her sister Lizzie, marrying her the day before she died in 1877 (Carver 2003:42). These women may have introduced him to the Chartist movement, of whose leaders he met several, including George Harney.\n\nEngels actively participated in the Revolution of 1848, taking part in the uprising at Elberfeld. Engels fought in the Baden campaign against the Prussians (June/July 1849) as the aide-de-camp of August Willich, who commanded a Free Corps in the Baden-Palatinate uprising. \n\nMarx and Engels first met in person in September 1844. They discovered that they had similar views on philosophy and on capitalism and decided to work together, producing a number of works including \"Die heilige Familie\" (\"The Holy Family\"). After the French authorities deported Marx from France in January 1845, Engels and Marx decided to move to Belgium, which then permitted greater freedom of expression than some other countries in Europe. Engels and Marx returned to Brussels in January 1846, where they set up the Communist Correspondence Committee.\n\nIn 1847, Engels and Marx began writing a pamphlet together, based on Engels' \"The Principles of Communism\". They completed the 12,000-word pamphlet in six weeks, writing it in such a manner as to make communism understandable to a wide audience and published it as \"The Communist Manifesto\" in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled both Engels and Marx. They moved to Cologne, where they began to publish a radical newspaper, the \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\". By 1849, both Engels and Marx had to leave Germany and moved to London. The Prussian authorities applied pressure on the British government to expel the two men, but Prime Minister Lord John Russell refused. With only the money that Engels could raise, the Marx family lived in extreme poverty. The contributions of Marx and Engels to the formation of Marxist theory have been described as inseparable.\n\nMarx's main ideas included:\n\nMarx believed that class identity was configured in the relations with the mode of production. In other words, a class is a collective of individuals who have a similar relationship with the means of production (as opposed to the more common-sense idea that class is determined by wealth alone, i.e. high class, middle class and poor class).\n\nMarx describes several social classes in capitalist societies, including primarily:\nThe bourgeoisie may be further subdivided into the very wealthy bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. The petty bourgeoisie are those who employ labor, but may also work themselves. These may be small proprietors, land-holding peasants, or trade workers. Marx predicted that the petty bourgeoisie would eventually be destroyed by the constant reinvention of the means of production and the result of this would be the forced movement of the vast majority of the petty bourgeoisie to the proletariat. Marx also identified the lumpenproletariat, a stratum of society completely disconnected from the means of production.\n\nMarx also describes the communists as separate from the oppressed proletariat. The communists were to be a unifying party among the proletariat; they were educated revolutionaries who could bring the proletariat to revolution and help them establish the democratic dictatorship of the proletariat. According to Marx, the communists would support any true revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Thus the communists aide the proletariat in creating the inevitable classless society (Vladimir Lenin takes this concept a step further by stating that only \"professional revolutionaries\" can lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie).\n\nThe Marxist theory of historical materialism understands society as fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given timeâthis means the relationships which people enter into with one another in order to fulfill their basic needs, for instance to feed and clothe themselves and their families. In general, Marx and Engels identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in Western Europe.\n\n"}

Various kinds of contemporary Latin can be distinguished. On the one hand there is its survival in areas such as taxonomy as the result of the widespread presence of the language in the New Latin era. This is usually found in the form of mere words or phrases used in the general context of other languages. On the other hand, there is the use of Latin as a language in its own right as a full-fledged means of expression. Living or Spoken Latin, being the most specific development of Latin in the contemporary context, is the primary subject of this article.\n\nAs a relic of the great importance of New Latin as the formerly dominant international \"lingua franca\" down to the 19th century in a great number of fields, Latin is still present in words or phrases used in many languages around the world, and some minor communities use Latin in their speech.\n\nThe official use of Latin in previous eras has survived at a symbolic level in many mottos that are still being used and even coined in Latin to this day. Old mottos like , found in 1776 on the Seal of the United States, along with and , and adopted by an Act of Congress in 1782, are still in use. Similarly, current pound sterling coins are minted with the Latin inscription \"ELIZABETHÂ·IIÂ·DÂ·GÂ·REGÂ·FÂ·D\" (, i.e. Queen by the Grace of God, Defender of the Faith). The official motto of the multilingual European Union, adopted as recently as 2000, is the Latin . Similarly, the motto on the Canadian Victoria Cross is in Latin, perhaps due to Canada's bilingual status.\n\nSome common phrases that are still in use in many languages have remained fixed in Latin, like the well-known or .\n\nIn fields as varied as mathematics, physics, astronomy, medicine, pharmacy, and biology, Latin still provides internationally accepted names of concepts, forces, objects, and organisms in the natural world.\n\nThe most prominent retention of Latin occurs in the classification of living organisms and the binomial nomenclature devised by Carolus LinnÃ¦us, although the rules of nomenclature used today allow the construction of names which may deviate considerably from historical norms.\n\nAnother continuation is the use of Latin names for the constellations and celestial objects (used in the Bayer designations of stars), as well as planets and satellites, whose surface features have been given Latin selenographic toponyms since the 17th century.\n\nSymbols for many of those chemical elements of the periodic table known in ancient times reflect and echo their Latin names, like Au for (gold) and Fe for (iron).\n\nLatin has also contributed a vocabulary for specialised fields such as anatomy and law which has become part of the normal, non-technical vocabulary of various European languages. Latin continues to be used to form international scientific vocabulary and classical compounds. Separately, more than 56% of the vocabulary used in English today derives ultimately from Latin, either directly (28.24%) or through French (28.30%).\n\nThe Catholic Church has continued to use Latin. Two main areas can be distinguished. One is its use for the official version of all documents issued by Vatican City, which has remained intact to the present. Although documents are first drafted in various vernaculars (mostly Italian), the official version is written in Latin by the Latin Letters Office. The other is its use for the liturgy, which has diminished after the Second Vatican Council of 1962â65, but seems to have recently seen some resurgence, sponsored in part by Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nAfter the Church of England published the Book of Common Prayer in English in 1559, a 1560 Latin edition was published for use at universities such as Oxford and the leading public schools, where the liturgy was still permitted to be conducted in Latin, and there have been several Latin translations since. Most recently a Latin edition of the 1979 USA Anglican Book of Common Prayer has appeared.\n\nLatin has also survived to some extent in the context of classical scholarship. Some classical periodicals, like \"Mnemosyne\" and the German \"Hermes\", to this day accept articles in Latin for publication.\n\nLatin is used in most of the introductions to the critical editions of ancient authors in the Oxford Classical Texts series, and it is also nearly always used for the apparatus criticus of Ancient Greek and Latin texts.\n\nThe University Orator at the University of Cambridge makes a speech in Latin marking the achievements of each of the honorands at the annual Honorary Degree Congregations, as does the Public Orator at the Encaenia ceremony at the University of Oxford. Harvard and Princeton also have Latin Salutatory commencement addresses every year.\n\nThe Charles University in Prague and many other universities around the world conduct the awarding of their doctoral degrees in Latin. Other universities and other schools issue diplomas written in Latin.\n\nIn addition to the above, Brown, , and Bard College also hold in Latin a portion of their graduation ceremonies.\n\nThe famous song is acknowledged as the anthem of academia and is sung at university opening or graduation ceremonies throughout Europe.\n\nLiving Latin ( in Latin itself), also known as Spoken Latin, is an effort to revive Latin as a spoken language and as the vehicle for contemporary communication and publication. Involvement in this Latin revival can be a mere hobby or extend to more serious projects for restoring its former role as an international auxiliary language.\n\nAfter the decline of Latin at the end of the New Latin era started to be perceived, there were attempts to counteract the decline and to revitalize the use of Latin for international communication.\n\nIn 1815, Miguel Olmo wrote a booklet proposing Latin as the common language for Europe, with the title (\"Leisure of Villaudric to the eight great princes who ordained world peace at Vienna in 1815, an extraordinary book about the Latin language and a Latin state to be founded\").\n\nIn the late 19th century, Latin periodicals advocating the revived use of Latin as an international language started to appear. Between 1889 and 1895, Karl Heinrich Ulrichs published in Italy his . This publication was followed by the , published by the architect and engineer Aristide Leonori from 1898, twice a month, until 1913, one year before the outbreak of World War I.\n\nThe early 20th century, marked by warfare and by drastic social and technological changes, saw few advances in the use of Latin outside academia. Following the beginnings of the re-integration of postwar Europe, however, Latin revivalism gained some strength.\n\nOne of its main promoters was the former dean of the University of Nancy (France), Prof. Jean Capelle, who in 1952 published a cornerstone article called \"Latin or Babel\" in which he proposed Latin as an international spoken language.\n\nCapelle was called \"the soul of the movement\" when in 1956 the first International Conference for Living Latin () took place in Avignon, marking the beginning of a new era of the active use of Latin. About 200 participants from 22 different countries took part in that foundational conference.\n\nThe essentials of the classical pronunciation had been defined since the early 19th century (e.g. in K.L. Schneider's , 1819), but in many countries there was strong resistance to adopting it in instruction. In English-speaking countries, where the traditional academic pronunciation diverged most markedly from the restored classical model, the struggle between the two pronunciations lasted for the entire 19th century. The transition between Latin pronunciations was long drawn out; in 1907 the \"new pronunciation\" was officially recommended by the Board of Education for adoption in schools in England.\n\nAlthough the older pronunciation, as found in the nomenclature and terminology of various professions, continued to be used for several decades, and in some spheres prevails to the present day, contemporary Latin as used by the living Latin community has generally adopted the classical pronunciation of Latin as restored by specialists in Latin historical phonology.\n\nA similar shift occurred in German-speaking areas: the traditional pronunciation is discussed in , while the reconstructed classical pronunciation, which took hold around 1900, is discussed at .\n\nMany users of contemporary Latin promote its use as a spoken language, a movement that dubs itself \"Living Latin\". Two main aims can be distinguished in this movement:\n\nAmong the proponents of spoken Latin, some promote the active use of the language to make learning Latin both more enjoyable and more efficient, drawing upon the methodologies of instructors of modern languages.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Association for the Reform of Latin Teaching (ARLT, still existing as the Association for Latin Teaching), was founded in 1913 by the distinguished classical scholar W. H. D. Rouse. It arose from summer schools which Rouse organised to train Latin teachers in the direct method of language teaching, which entailed using the language in everyday situations rather than merely learning grammar and syntax by rote. The Classical Association also encourages this approach. The Cambridge University Press has now published a series of school textbooks based on the adventures of a mouse called Minimus, designed to help children of primary school age to learn the language, as well as its well-known Cambridge Latin Course (CLC) to teach the language to secondary school students, all of which include extensive use of dialogue and an approach to language teaching mirroring that now used for most modern languages, which have brought many of the principles espoused by Rouse and the ARLT into the mainstream of Latin teaching.\n\nOutside Great Britain, one of the most accomplished handbooks that fully adopts the direct method for Latin is the well-known by the Dane Hans Henning Ãrberg, first published in 1955 and improved in 1990. It is composed fully in Latin, and requires no other language of instruction, and it can be used to teach pupils whatever their mother tongue.\n\nOthers support the revival of Latin as a language of international communication, in the academic, and perhaps even the scientific and diplomatic, spheres (as it was in Europe and European colonies through Middle Ages until the mid-18th century), or as an international auxiliary language to be used by anyone. However, as a language native to no people, this movement has not received support from any government, national or supranational.\n\nA substantial group of institutions (particularly in Europe, but also in North and South America) has emerged to support the use of Latin as a spoken language.\n\nThe foundational first International Conference for living Latin () that took place in Avignon was followed by at least five others. As a result of those first conferences, the was then created in Rome. Among its most prominent members are well-known classicists from all over the world, like Prof. Michael von Albrecht or Prof. . The ALF held its first international conference in Rome in 1966 bringing together about 500 participants. From then on conferences have taken place every four or five years, in Bucharest, Malta, Dakar, Erfurt, Berlin, Madrid, and many other places. The official language of the ALF is Latin and all acts and proceedings take place in Latin.\n\nAlso in the year 1966 ClÃ©ment Desessard published a method with tapes within the series of the French company Assimil. Desessard's work aimed at teaching contemporary Latin for use in an everyday context, although the audio was often criticized for being recorded with a thick French accent. Assimil took this out of print at the end of 2007 and published another Latin method which focused on the classical idiom only. However, in 2015 Assimil re-published Desessard's edition with new audio CDs in restored classical Latin pronunciation. Desessard's method is still used for living Latin instruction at the .\n\nIn 1986 the Belgian radiologist Gaius Licoppe, who had discovered the contemporary use of Latin and learnt how to speak it thanks to Desessard's method, founded in Brussels the for the promotion of Latin teaching and use for communication.\n\nIn Germany, Marius Alexa and Inga Pessarra-Grimm founded in September 1987 the (LVPA, or Association for the Promotion of Living Latin).\n\nThe first (AmÃ¶neburg Latin Week) was organized in 1989 at AmÃ¶neburg, near Marburg in Germany, by Mechtild Hofmann and Robert Maier. Since then the Latin Weeks were offered every year. In addition, members of the supporting association (\"European Latin Weeks\") published a text book named that contains dialogues in modern everyday Latin.\n\nAt the located in Rome, Italy, all classes are taught by faculty fluent in Latin or Ancient Greek, and resident students speak in Latin or Greek at all times outside class. Most students are supported by scholarships from the Mnemosyne foundation and spend one or two years in residence to acquire fluency in Latin. The living Latin movement eventually crossed the Atlantic, where it continues to grow. In the summer of 1996, at the University of Kentucky, Prof. Terence Tunberg established the first Conventiculum, an immersion conference in which participants from all over the world meet annually to exercise the active use of Latin to discuss books and literature, and topics related to everyday life. The success of the Conventiculum Lexintoniense has inspired similar conferences throughout the United States.\n\nIn October 1996 the (SALVI, or North American Institute for Living Latin Studies) was founded in Los Angeles, by a group of professors and students of Latin literature concerned about the long-term future of classical studies in the US.\n\nIn the University of Kentucky, Prof. Terence Tunberg founded the (known in English as the Institute of Latin Studies), which awards Graduate Certificates in Latin Studies addressed at those with a special interest gaining \"a thorough command of the Latin language in reading, writing and speaking, along with a wide exposure to the cultural riches of the Latin tradition in its totality\". This is the only degree-conferring program in the world with courses taught entirely in Latin.\n\nThere is also a proliferation of Latin-speaking institutions, groups and conferences in the Iberian Peninsula and in Latin America. Some prominent examples of this tendency towards the active use of Latin within Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries are the annual conferences called Jornadas de Culturaclasica.com, held in different cities of southern Spain, as well as the CAELVM (), a Latin summer program in Madrid. In 2012, the was founded in Puebla, Mexico, by Prof. Alexis Hellmer, in order to promote the study of Latin in that country, where only one university grants a degree in Classics.\n\nMost of these groups and institutions organise seminars and conferences where Latin is used as a spoken language, both throughout the year and over the summer, in Europe and in America.\n\nLess academic summer encounters wholly carried out in Latin are the ones known as (European Latin Weeks), celebrated in Germany and attracting people of various ages from all over Europe.\n\nAt the present time, several periodicals and social networking web sites are published in Latin. In France, immediately after the conference at Avignon, the publisher launched the magazine , which still exists, associated to the CERCAM () of the Paul ValÃ©ry University, Montpellier III. Until very recently, it was published in Latin in its entirety. In Germany, the magazine was founded in 1965 by Caelestis Eichenseer (1924â2008) and is to this day published wholly in Latin four times a year in the University of SaarbrÃ¼cken. In Belgium, the magazine \"Melissa\" created in 1984 by Gaius Licoppe is still published six times a year completely in Latin.\n\nThe Finnish radio station YLE Radio 1 has for many years broadcast a now famous weekly review of world news called completely in Latin. The German Radio Bremen also had regular broadcasts in Latin (till December 2017). Other attempts have been less successful. Beginning from July 2015 Radio F.R.E.I. from Erfurt (Germany) broadcasts in Latin once a week on Wednesdays for 15 minutes; the broadcast is called .\n\nIn 2015 the Italian startup pptArt launched its catalogue () and its registration form for artists () in Latin and English.\n\nIn 2016 ACEM (Enel executives' cultural association) organized with Luca Desiata and Daniel Gallagher the first Business Latin course for managers ().\n\nThe government of Finland, during its presidencies of the European Union, issued official newsletters in Latin on top of the official languages of the Union.\n\nThe emergence of the Internet on a global scale in the 1990s provided a great tool for the flourishing of communication in Latin, and in February 1996 a Polish Latinist from Warsaw (Poland), Konrad M. Kokoszkiewicz, founded what is still today the most populated and successful Latin-only email list on the Internet, the . Subsequently, the Nuntii Latini of YLE Radio 1 would also create a discussion list called \"YLE Colloquia Latina\". The Circulus Latinus Panormitanus of Palermo (Italy) went a step further creating the first online chat in Latin called the .\n\nIn February 2003 Konrad M. Kokoszkiewicz published an on-line glossary with his proposals for some computer terms in Latin under the title of . The Internet also allows for the preservation of other contemporary Latin dictionaries that have fallen out of print or have never been printed, like the or the .\n\nIn June 2004 an on-line newspaper was founded once again from Warsaw by , and is to this day published wholly in Latin about current affairs.\n\nIn January 2008 a \"Schola\", (membership 1800) a Latin-only social network service, including a real-time video and/or text chatroom, was founded from London (UK).\n\nA number of Latin web portals, websites, and blogs in Latin have developed, like from Russia or from somewhere in the US.\n\nThe Internet also provides tools like Latin spell checkers for contemporary Latin writers, or scansion tools for contemporary Latin poets.\n\nSome websites, such as Google and Facebook, provide Latin as a language option.\n\nThere is a MUD text game in Latin called Labyrinthus Latinus aimed at uniting people interested in the language. The website is shut down but the game is still available at codice_1. In addition, the video games Minecraft, OpenTTD, and The Battle for Wesnoth provide Latin as a language option.\n\nThere is even a Latin Wikipedia, although discussions are held not only in Latin but in German, English, and other languages as well. Nearly 200 active editors work on the project. There are nearly 100,000 articles on topics ranging from to , , and . Those in particularly good Latin, currently about 10% of the whole, are marked.\n\nAlthough less so than in previous eras, contemporary Latin has also been used for public notices in public spaces:\n\nThe Wallsend Metro station of the Tyne and Wear Metro has signs in Latin.\n\nThe Vatican City has an automated teller machine with instructions in Latin.\n\nSome contemporary works have been produced originally in Latin, most overwhelmingly poetry, but also prose, as well as music or cinema. They include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA T-shirt with the rhyming motto , \"Many are Cold but Few are Frozen\" for the fictional University of Antarctica, with a penguin seal, by artist Janice Bender. The motto's translation puns the Christian motto, \"Many are Called but Few are Chosen.\"\n\nVarious textsâusually children's booksâhave been translated into Latin since the beginning of the living Latin movement in the early fifties for various purposes, including use as a teaching tool or simply to demonstrate the capability of Latin as a means of expression in a popular context. They include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

First published in 1982, it focuses on the expansion of European societies in the Modern Era. \"Europe and the people without history\" is history written on a global scale, tracing the connections between communities, regions, peoples and nations that are usually treated as discrete subjects.\n\nThe book begins in 1400 with a description of the trade routes a world traveller might have encountered, the people and societies they connected, and the civilizational processes trying to incorporate them. From this, Wolf traces the emergence of Europe as a global power, and the reorganization of particular world regions for the production of goods now meant for global consumption. Wolf differs from World Systems theory in that he sees the growth of Europe until the late eighteenth century operating in a tributary framework, and not capitalism. He examines the way that colonial state structures were created to protect tributary populations involved in the silver, fur and slave trades. Whole new \"tribes\" were created as they were incorporated into circuits of mercantile accumulation. The final section of the book deals with the transformation in these global networks as a result of the growth of capitalism with the industrial revolution. Factory production of textiles in England, for example transformed cotton production in the American south and Egypt, and eliminated textile production in India. All these transformations are connected in a single structural change. Each of the world's regions are examined in terms of the goods they produced in the global division of labour, as well as the mobilization and migration of whole populations (such as African slaves) to produce these goods. Wolf uses labor market segmentation to provide a historical account of the creation of ethnic segmentation. Where World Systems theory had little to say about the periphery, Wolf's emphasis is on the people \"without history\" (i.e. not given a voice in western histories) and on how they were active participants in the creation of new cultural and social forms emerging in the context of commercial empire.\n\nWolf distinguishes between three modes of production: capitalist, kin-ordered, and tributary. Wolf does not view them as an evolutionary sequence. He begins with capitalism because he argues our understanding of kin-ordered and tributary modes is coloured by our understanding of capitalism. He argues they are not evolutionary precursors of capitalism, but the product of the encounter between the West and the Rest. In the tributary mode, direct producers possess their own means of production, but their surplus production is taken from them through extra economic means. This appropriation is usually by some form of strong or weak state. In the kin-ordered mode of production, social labour is mobilized through kin relations (such as lineages), although his description makes its exact relations with tributary and capitalist modes unclear. The kin mode was further theorized by French structuralist Marxists in terms of 'articulated modes of production.' The kin-ordered mode is distinct again from Sahlins' formulation of the domestic mode of production.\n"}

They usually cater to \"sub-regional markets of larger metropolitan areas.\" FECs are generally small compared to full-scale amusement parks, with fewer attractions, a lower per-person per-hour cost to consumers than a traditional amusement park, and not usually major tourist attractions, but sustained by an area customer base. Many are locally owned and operated, although there are a number of chains and franchises in the field. FECs are sometimes called family amusement centers, play zones, family fun centers, or simply fun centers. Some non-traditional FECs, called urban entertainment centers (UECs), with more customized and branded attractions and retail outlets, are associated with major entertainment companies and may be tourist destinations. Others, sometimes operated by Non-Profit organizations as Children's Museums or Science Centers, tend to be geared toward edutainment experiences rather than simply amusement. FECs may also be adjuncts to full-scale amusement parks.\n\nFECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of theme restaurants that increasingly developed their in-house amusement features, small-scale amusement parks needing more offerings than just a few rides and midway games, and diversifying formerly one-attraction venues (water parks, skate parks, billiard halls, bowling alleys, and so on). All three categories have moved over several decades continually toward stock, popular entertainment solutions supplied by third-party vendors. Among the earliest of the themed restaurants to become known more for family entertainment than food was Chuck E. Cheese's, a pizza restaurant founded in 1977 in San Jose, California.\n\nMost FECs have at least five common major or \"anchor\" attractions, to provide diverse patrons (often in large parties) at least one to two hours of entertainment, to encourage repeat visits, and to reduce time spent waiting for any given attraction. Some of the more usual attractions include (depending upon size, climate, etc.):\n\nThe most common anchor activities are miniature golf, kart racing, arcade and redemption games, and food & beverage, according to industry specialists StoneCreek Partners. FECs rarely use custom-built attractions, because of the costs involved, and instead install off-the-shelf systems provided and maintained by industry equipment vendors.\n\nAny given FEC may lean more towards outdoor activities, arcade gaming, or passive entertainment and dining. Each may cater to different age ranges, all the time, or during certain hours, e.g. children and entire families in the daytime, and teens to young adults in the evening, with specific promotional programs to attract different market segments at different times.\n\nFECs tend to serve \"sub-regional markets\", such as small cities, quadrants or boroughs of larger cities, and a large suburban area outside such a city. Their busiest times are weekend afternoons and Thursday through Saturday evenings.\n\nBecause most of the attractions are essentially the same from FEC to FEC, two of the most important factors in a particular center distinguishing itself to potential customers are a highly visible location (hard to obtain because other uses for the land are often more competitive), and a consistently developed and promoted theme that appeals to the target market segments, \"the fun factor in the overall decor\".\n\nParental concerns are also important. While children themselves rarely think of it, a major factor in the attractiveness of an FEC to parents is on-site safety and security, as adults may drop off older children at such an establishment to entertain themselves. An increasingly important factor for success is high-quality food and drink to attract parental spending as well as whole-family dining.\n\nVarious major media and entertainment brands, including Disney, Lego, NASCAR, Sega, Sony, United Artists/Regal and Viacom, have been attached to family entertainment centers, often much less \"traditional\" than local and chain FECs, with custom-built, unique attractions, usually heavily branded, and most often located in major metropolitan areas. The first such urban entertainment center (UEC) was the Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles, California, which opened in 1993, linking several Universal properties. Including various retail outlets, restaurants, and attractions, the CityWalk created a great deal of \"sustained buzz\" in the retail real estate industry, which began \"embracing the notion that Universal Studios, Sony, Disney, and other entertainment companies could create new anchors and entertainment programs for shopping centers\". Another significant UEC was the Sony Metreon in San Francisco, California (1999â2006).\n\nSome nonprofit, educational installations, such as the Exploratorium in San Francisco, also have aspects of FECs in format and atmosphere, but with activities geared toward learning and experiencing rather than simple entertainment. Some for-profit enterprises also use this model, or mix edutainment with simpler amusement attractions.\n\nThe major international industry association that supports FECs is the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA), which merged with and absorbed the membership of the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry (IALEI) in October 2009. IAAPA maintains addresses in the Virginia, Hong Kong, Brussels, Belgium and Mexico City. The International Laser Tag Association (ILTA) also remains active (and more broadly than its name suggests). ILTA is based in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S. For many smaller, community centric FEC's and owner/operators who can't always make the IAAPA tradeshow, IAAO the International Association of Amusement Operators is an online resource for family entertainment center operators and startups.\n\nCanadian FECs are called \"family entertainment centres\" or \"fun centres\", due to British-style spelling conventions in Canadian English.\n\n\nThe main national industry group in the U.S. is the National Association of Family Entertainment Centers (NAFEC), which is perhaps incongruously a division of the International Laser Tag Association (ILTA).\n\nSome U.S.-based companies also have venues in Canada (noted above), but this is rare due to the legal/political difficulties involved in cross-border corporations.\n\nAmerican FECs vary wildly in themes, size and features. Some of the larger businesses in this category have included:\n\n\n\n"}

She married James Morson, a doctor for St George's Hospital, in 1838. Shortly after their marriage, James Morson was appointed as Chief Medical Officer for the Brazilian National Mining Association. He died in 1848, leaving Georgiana with three children to provide for by her own efforts.\n\nIn 1854, Morson would resign from her post as matron of Urania Cottage in order to marry George Wade Harrison, a printer and bookseller, and they settled in Sevenoaks.\n\nOn 26 May 1846, Dickens wrote Burdett-Coutts a lengthy letter stating his desire to open an asylum for girls and women working in London's streets as prostitutes. The letter included planning for the asylum ranging from finding a property in London to a detailed process of rehabilitating fallen women. For example, Dickens suggests introducing a marks system and probationary period for asylum residents. He writes: It is explained to her that she is degraded and fallen, but not lost, having this shelter; and that the means of Return to Happiness are now about to be put into her own hands, and trusted to her own keeping. That with this view, she is, instead of being placed in this probationary class for a month, or two months, or three months, or any specified time whatever, required to earn there, a certain number of Marks (they are mere scratches in a book) so that she may make her probation a very short one, or a very long one, according to her own conduct. For so much work, she has so many Marks; for a day's good conduct, so many more. For every instance of ill-temper, disrespect, bad language, any outbreak of any sort or kind, so many - a very large number in proportion to her receipts - are deducted. A perfect Debtor and Creditor account is kept between her and the Superintendent, for every day; and the state of that account, it is in her own power and nobody else's, to adjust to her advantage. Dickens located a home for the asylum originally named Urania Cottage in Shepherds Bush, Middlesex in 1847. He worked closely with Burdett-Coutts in the asylum founding and administration, regularly attending meetings and writing about the home in his journal, \"All the Year Round\".\nOpening to residents in November 1847, the institution provided food, shelter, and a detailed daily routine for the residents. Residents learned to read and write, worked in the garden, completed all household tasks including needlework, attended singing lessons, and cooked food for local poor relief.\n\nGeorgiana Morson served as a dedicated matron of Urania Cottage from 1849 to 1854. In her book, \"Charles Dickens and the House of Fallen Women\" (2009), Jenny Hartley describes how, \"Georgiana Morson proved herself the best matron Urania ever had... she taught the girls to read and write, as well as all the household skills a servant needed. She presided over the dining table, and made mealtimes a social occasion the girls had not known before. They ate the good food she had taught them to cook and chattered about their future prospects.\" \n\nDickens praised Morson's oversight at Urania Cottage in a letter recommending her as matron for the Foundling Hospital in 1852. Writing to the governors of the hospital on 9 July 1852, Dickens describes her \"capacity for the administration of such an office.\" He goes on to explain that:She is a lady of great discretion, of remarkable sweetness of temper, and has a power of uniting firmness with conciliation in a very remarkable and uncommon manner. I have never known her to make a mistake even under circumstances of great difficulty, and I have invariably found that those under her care have become attached to her. She is accustomed to method, order, punctuality, and to a habit of sound and judicious observation. I would entrust her, myself, with the duties to which she now aspires, in preference to any lady I have ever seen in a similar capacity.\n"}
{"id": "41742612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41742612", "title": "Gun cultures", "text": "Gun cultures\n\nGun cultures are found around the world, and evidence various attitudes towards guns in such places as the United States, Canada, Israel, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Yemen and Pakistan. Among the most studied and discussed global gun cultures is that of the gun culture in the United States.\n\nLike British gun culture, Canadian gun culture is also largely represented by sport-shooting and hunting and less on self-defense. Sport-shooting has always been a popular activity for both gun-owners and non-gun-owners in Canada. It is also a bridge and a leeway between American and British attitudes towards firearms. The provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Alberta have large populations of hunters and shooters.\n\nThe Conservative Party over the recent years, has been protective of the sport-shooting community, passing many bills that cater to their needs. In 2012, Bill C-19 eliminated the need to register \"non-restricted\" firearms (shotguns and regular rifles). In 2015, Bill C-42 converted \"Possession-Only\" licences to a regular firearms licence or a \"Possession and Acquisition Licence\", as well as the right to transport firearms to a shooting range without having to notify a chief firearms officer.\n\nMost Canadians who own firearms use them for hunting or sport-shooting. Canadians have mixed opinions about using firearms for self-defence, and the legality of self-defence in Canada has been a subject of controversy and debate. After the incident of Ian Thomson, a gun owner who was arrested under murder and storage violations for shooting intruders with a firearm, the Canadian parliament amended the Criminal Code to make use of force legal. This finally made it legal for gun owners to use their firearms for self-defence, as technically \"anything\" within their disposal can be legally used - including firearms themselves. Canadians opposed to the use of firearms for personal protection argue that it is purely an American tradition. Yet despite the Criminal Code amendments, the firearms storage laws still make it rather difficult for citizens to use their firearms for home defence in a situation. In addition, it is still up the Courts to decide whether the use of force was \"justifiable\".\n\nDue to Canada's proximity and close history and cultural ties with the United States, the cultural and socio-political environment surrounding firearms has recently begun to emulate American attitudes, where those who oppose stricter gun laws as well as the right to use guns for personal protection, tend to vote for the Conservative Party as well as other right-leaning groups. Those who support stricter gun laws and are opposed to legalizing the use of firearms for self-defence tend to vote for the Liberal Party, New Democratic Party or other liberal and left-leaning groups in the country.\n\nAlthough a \"right to bear arms\" is never explicitly stated in Canada's Charters of Freedom and Rights, conservative-leaning gun owners claim that a right to bear arms is present within the layers of Canada and Britain's historical documents.\n\nThere are many organizations in Canada meant at protecting sport-shooting and firearms ownership, these include the National Firearms Association (NFA) and the Canadian Shooting Sports Association (CSSA). Out of the two, the NFA advocates self-defence with a firearm and has recently begun to emulate the American NRA.\n\nThe Czech Republic gun culture is unique, as it has relatively low firearm ownership per capita, but allows gun ownership for personal protection on shall issue basis, including concealed carry permits. Around 80% of Czech 300,000 gun owners have an E category license, for personal protection. The reason for this is Czech history of being occupied by foreign powers, Nazi Germany and Soviet Union, who did not allow most citizens to own guns. Liberal gun laws are also traditional in Czech lands, starting with Imperial regulation No. 223 in 1852, which was used during the time of First Czechoslovak Republic. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, the law was liberalized in 1995, when legal right to own firearms was restored, and further in 2002, when many other types of firearms were legalized prior to Czech accession to EU, which required the law to be compatible with the European Firearms Directive.\n\nThere are 2 major organizations advocating for legal gun ownership, Lex - sdruÅ¾enÃ­ na ochranu prÃ¡v majitelÅ¯ zbranÃ­, and Petice proti nesmyslnÃ½m zÃ¡kazÅ¯m legÃ¡lnÃ­ch zbranÃ­ - LIGA LIBE , which was formed by a team behind a petition against the European Firearms Directive, founded in 2014.\n\nDue to the history of Israel and the many wars it has fought, Israeli society has emphasized the need to be armed and well-trained. Amid the days leading up to Israel's creation, many Jewish paramilitary groups operated in Israel to protect their kibbutzim from Arab militants. These various groups would eventually merge to form the modern-day Israel Defense Forces. During the 2002 Intifada, guns were a common sight as civilians needed to protect themselves. However, the majority of Israeli gun culture is vested within the military and associated with serving in some armed service rather than a fringe militia. Men and women over the age of 18 (with exceptions), are required to serve in the Israel Defense Forces. As part of the terms of their service, Israeli soldiers are allowed to carry their firearms, on or off-duty, in uniform or without the uniform.\n\nIsraeli civilians who carry and own firearms are mostly settlers in the West Bank region. Though on the other hand, Israeli gun laws are actually strict. A civilian would need to apply for a gun license, and demonstrate a need to own a firearm. Therefore, it is rather difficult for an average civilian to attain a firearms license, unless he/she lives in an area proven to be dangerous, or has the necessary military experience required by Israeli law.\n\nGun ownership, especially in the mountainous northwest, is part of traditional Pakistani culture. Rifles are handed down from generation to generation for hunting and for celebratory fire. In the 21st century, increases in terrorist threats, and particularly in urban kidnappings, extortions, and robberies, has led to an increase in civilian demand for guns for self-protection.\n\nRussia also has a unique firearms culture, though that culture is dedicated heavily towards military use rather than to civilian ownership and much of it originates from the Soviet Union (paradoxically an era of strict gun control) and their war against Nazi Germany. Russia prides itself in having produced some of the world's most famous firearms, most notably the AK-47 and PPSh-41. During the days of the Russian Empire, many people living in the Ural Mountains owned firearms for hunting and training and at one point, Russia had a very high civilian firearms ownership rate.\n\nDuring World War II, and the years building up to it, saw a surge in firearms culture in the Soviet Union. Rifle-training and marksmanship was seen as a symbol of fighting honor for the Soviet motherland, and later were a source of influence for sniping schools in the United States. During the Battle of Stalingrad, the city's fate also relied on local militias. Firearms were also part of military propaganda, such as in the case of the famous Soviet sniper Vasily Zaytsev. Soviet snipers were essential and important to the Soviet strategy against the German invasion.\n\nToday, the legacy of Russian weaponry is very popular with firearms enthusiasts in the United States and the world, and are some of the most discussed firearms by historians.\n\nThe emergence of the AK-47 as one of the world's most popular battle rifles has presented a stereotype of Russians as wielding AK-47s and having a gun culture similar to America. However, the reality of the situation presents the opposite, according to a survey done by the Zircon public opinion research group, over 70% of Russians were opposed to the right to bear arms.\n\nMales with ages between 18 and 30 are conscripted and can choose to do the military service and â as part of that â can keep their firearms at home.\n\nThe SAT (lit. shooting and off-duty activities) oversees lessons in which every Swiss kid in the year of their 15th anniversary to the year of their 20th or the one in which they begin their conscription can learn how to shoot with the SIG SG 550. This activity is free and the Young Shooters are able to take home the rifle in-between the lessons if they are 17. Though for obvious security reasons, the breach has to stay at the range in which they attend the lesson. This activity takes place over a span of 6 years by a 3~4 months period a year and, if wanted, they can pursue and become instructors for the new generation of Young Shooters.\n\nSwitzerland holds the biggest gun-fest in the world: the \"EidgenÃ¶ssisches Feldschiessen\". This competition takes place annually and in 2012 they counted 130,000 participants. Every Swiss who's 10 or older can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle.\n\nGuns are widely used for competition in sport-shooting.\n\nThe U.K. gun culture is represented by shooting sports. Clay-pigeon shooting is one of the more popular sports. Firearms are very popular predominantly among the rural communities. However outside of the rural areas, the society is overwhelmingly anti-gun, and many anti-gun advocates come from Britain.\n\nThe use of firearms for self-defence, even among leaders of the sport-shooting community is generally frowned upon, with the exception of Northern Ireland, where guns are legal for self-defence. Even the use of firearms by local police officers is frowned upon; police officers in the country are not typically equipped with firearms, only special units of law enforcement (the firearms units) do so.\n\nThe main sport-shooting organization in the United Kingdom is the National Rifle Association (not to be confused for, and is not in any way, related to the American organization of the same name).\n\nGun ownership in the United States is constitutionally protected by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. Firearms are widely used in the United States of America for self-defense, hunting, and recreational uses, such as target shooting. Gun politics is polarized between advocates of gun rights, typically conservative, and those who support stricter gun control, usually liberal. The gun culture of the United States can be considered unique among developed countries, in terms of the large number of firearms owned by civilians and generally permissive regulations.\n\nYemen's gun culture is very similar to that of Pakistan's, in that firearms ownership is not only used for self-defense, but also used in celebratory fire. Guns also had a higher demand after the 2011 uprisings and other political insecurities throughout the country. Owning a firearm in Yemen is seen in a positive light, as society views it as a symbol of manhood and leadership. Tribesman even carry their firearms to mediate disputes between other tribal leaders.\n\n\n"}

At Toyota, even if you do a project successfully, there is still a \"hansei-kai\" (reflection meeting) to review what went wrong. If a manager or engineer claims that there were not any problems with the project, they will be reminded that âno problem is a problemâ â in other words, you have not objectively and critically evaluated the project to find opportunities for improvement. No problems indicate that you did not stretch to meet (or exceed) your expected capacity.\n\nAn example would be the actions of Japanese politicians involved in corruption. They apologize publicly for the inappropriate action, then remove themselves from public politics for a few years. They resume their career after a culturally accepted period of time where they learned their lesson.\n\nIn Japanese companies it is common practice for a manager to expect \"hansei\" from his subordinates in case of mistakes. The manager will publicly take the blame, while the department works on solving the problem.\n\nHansei also incorporates the concept of greeting success with modesty and humility. To stop \"hansei,\" means to stop learning. With \"hansei,\" one never becomes convinced of one's own superiority, and feels that there is always more room, or need, for further improvement.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "385946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=385946", "title": "Hierarchy of genres", "text": "Hierarchy of genres\n\nA hierarchy of genres is any formalization which ranks different genres in an art form in terms of their prestige and cultural value.\n\nIn literature, the epic was considered the highest form, for the reason expressed by Samuel Johnson in his \"Life of John Milton\": \"By the general consent of criticks, the first praise of genius is due to the writer of an epick poem, as it requires an assemblage of all the powers which are singly sufficient for other compositions.\" Below that came lyric poetry, and comic poetry, with a similar ranking for drama. The novel took a long time to establish a firm place in the hierarchy, doing so only as belief in any systematic hierarchy of forms expired in the 19th century.\n\nIn music, settings of words were accorded a higher status than merely instrumental works, at least until the Baroque period, and opera retained a superior status for much longer. The status of works also varies with the number of players and singers involved, with those for large forces, which are certainly more difficult to write and more expensive to perform, given higher status. Any element of comedy reduced the status of a work, though, as in other art forms, often increasing its popularity.\n\nThe hierarchies in figurative art are those initially formulated for painting in 16th-century Italy, which held sway with little alteration until the early 19th century. These were formalized and promoted by the academies in Europe between the 17th century and the modern era, of which the most influential became the French AcadÃ©mie de peinture et de sculpture, which held a central role in Academic art. The fully developed hierarchy distinguished between:\n\n\nThe hierarchy was based on a distinction between art that made an intellectual effort to \"render visible the universal essence of things\" (\"imitare\" in Italian) and that which merely consisted of \"mechanical copying of particular appearances\" (\"ritrarre\"). Idealism was privileged over realism in line with Renaissance Neo-Platonist philosophy.\n\nThe term is mostly used within the field of painting, and from the High Renaissance onwards, by which time painting had asserted itself as the highest form of art. This had not been the case in Medieval art and the art-commissioning sectors of society took a considerable period to fully accept this view. The Raphael Cartoons are a clear example of the continuing status of tapestry, the most expensive form of art in the 16th century. In the Early Medieval period lavish pieces of metalwork had typically been the most highly regarded, and valuable materials remained an important ingredient in the appreciation of art until at least the 17th century. Until the 19th century the most extravagant objets d'art remained more expensive, both new and on the art market, than all but a few paintings. Classical writings which valued the supreme skills of individual artists were influential, as well as developments in art which allowed the Renaissance artist to demonstrate their skill and invention to a greater degree than was usually possible in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe hierarchy grew out of the struggle to gain acceptance of painting as one of the Liberal arts, and then controversies to establish an equal or superior status within them with architecture and sculpture. These matters were considered of great importance by artist-theorists such as Leon Battista Alberti, Leonardo da Vinci, and Giorgio Vasari. Against the sculptors, Leonardo argued that the intellectual effort necessary to create an illusion of three-dimensionality made the painters' art superior to that of the sculptor, who could do so merely by recording appearances. In his \"De Pictura\" (\"About Painting\") of 1441, Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer. He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.\n\nTheorists of the Early and High Renaissance accepted the importance of representing nature closely, at least until the later writings of Michelangelo, who was strongly influenced by neoplatonism. By the time of Mannerist theorists such as Gian Paolo Lomazzo and Federico Zuccari (both also painters) this was far less of a priority. Both emphasized beauty as \"something which was directly infused into the mind of man from the mind of God, and existed there independent of any sense-impressions\", a view bound to further reduce the status of works depending on realism. In practice the hierarchy represented little break with either medieval and classical thought, except to place secular history painting in the same class as religious art, and to distinguish (not always clearly) between static iconic religious subjects and narrative figure scenes, giving the latter a higher status. Ideas of decorum also fed into the hierarchy; comic, sordid or merely frivolous subjects or treatment ranked lower than elevated and moral ones.\n\nDuring the Renaissance landscape, genre scenes and still lifes hardly existed as established genres, so discussion of the status or importance of different types of painting was mainly concerned with history subjects as against portraits, initially small and unpretentious, and iconic portrait-type religious and mythological subjects. For most artists some commitment to realism was necessary in a portrait; few could take the high-handed approach of Michelangelo, who largely ignored the actual appearance of the Medici in his Medici Chapel sculptures, supposedly saying that in a thousand years no one would know the difference (a retort Gainsborough is also said to have used, with a shorter timeframe). \n\nMany portraits were extremely flattering, which could be justified by an appeal to idealism as well as the sitter's vanity; the theorist Armenini claimed in 1587 that \"portraits by excellent artists are considered to be painted with better style [\"maniera\"] and greater perfection than others, but more often than not they are less good likenesses\". On the other hand, numbers of courtly sitters and their parents, suitors or courtiers complained that painters entirely failed to do justice to the reality of the sitter.\n\nThe question of decorum in religious art became the focus of intense effort by the Catholic Church after the decrees on art of the Council of Trent of 1563. Paintings depicting biblical events as if they were occurring in the households of wealthy contemporary Italians were attacked, and soon ceased. Until the challenge of Caravaggio at the end of the century, religious art became thoroughly ideal.\n\nThe new genres of landscape, genre painting, animal painting and still life came into their own in the 17th century, with the virtual cessation of religious painting in Protestant countries, and the expansion of picture buying to the prosperous middle class. Although similar developments occurred in all advanced European countries, they were most evident in the enormously productive schools of Dutch Golden Age painting and Flemish Baroque painting. However no theorists emerged to champion the new genres, and the relatively small amount of Dutch theoretical writing, by Karel van Mander, Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten, Gerard de Lairesse and others, was mostly content to rehash Italian views, so that their writings can seem oddly at variance with the Dutch art actually being produced in their day.\n\nThe hierarchy was mostly accepted by artists, and even genre specialists such as Jan Steen, Karel Dujardin and Vermeer produced a few history paintings, which were better paid when commissions could be obtained, but in general far harder to sell. The unhappy history of Rembrandt's last history commission, \"The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis\" (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience. In Flanders, as well as great quantities of pure genre works, there was a trend towards history paintings with a major genre element, whether animals, landscape or still life. Often the different elements were painted by different artists; Rubens and Frans Snyders often co-operated in this way.\n\nThe size of paintings, and very often the prices they realized, increasingly tended to reflect their position in the hierarchy in this period. Until the Romantic period the price and saleability of what were essentially landscapes could be increased by adding small mythological or religious figures, creating a \"landscape with...\", a practice that went back to the beginnings of landscape painting in the Flemish world landscapes of Joachim Patinir in the early 16th century. Flemish Baroque painting was the last school to often paint the lowest genres at a large size, but usually combined with figure subjects.\n\nAn influential formulation of 1667 by AndrÃ© FÃ©libien, a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:Celui qui fait parfaitement des paÃ¯sages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne reprÃ©sentent que des choses mortes & sans mouvement ; & comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, & ne peut prÃ©tendre Ã  l'honneur que reÃ§oivent les plus sÃ§avans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure Ã  la reprÃ©sentation de plusieurs ensemble ; il faut traiter l'histoire & la fable ; il faut reprÃ©senter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agrÃ©ables comme les PoÃ«tes ; & montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allÃ©goriques, sÃ§avoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, & les mystÃ¨res les plus relevez.\n\nHe who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more estimable than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled. For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal\".\n\nAllegorical painting was raised above other types of history painting; together they were the \"grand genre\", including paintings with religious, mythological, historical, literary, or allegorical subjectsâthey embodied some interpretation of life or conveyed a moral or intellectual message. The gods and goddesses from the ancient mythologies represented different aspects of the human psyche, figures from religions represented different ideas, and history, like the other sources, represented a dialectic or play of ideas. Subjects with several figures ranked higher than single figures. For a long time, especially during the French Revolution, history painting often focused on depiction of the heroic male nude; though this waned in the 19th century.\n\nAfter history painting came, in order of decreasing worth: portraits, scenes of everyday life (called \"scÃ¨nes de genre\", or \"genre painting\", and also \"petit genre\" to contrast it with the \"grande genre\"), landscapes, animal painting, and finally still lifes. In his formulation, such paintings were inferior because they were merely reportorial pictures without moral force or artistic imagination. Genre paintingsâneither ideal in style, nor elevated in subjectâwere admired for their skill, ingenuity, and even humour, but never confused with high art. \n\nThe hierarchy of genres also had a corresponding hierarchy of formats: large format for history paintings, small format for still lifes. This had occasionally been breached in the past, especially in large Flemish works, and the monumental \"The Young Bull\" of the Dutch artist Paulus Potter, as well as the larger of the two \"Butchers' Shop\" canvases of Annibale Carracci. But for the most part the relative prices obtainable for the different genres ensured the hierarchy of size also; it would not have been economic to paint a very large subject from the lower genres, except for commissioned group portraits. Rubens' largest landscapes were painted for his own houses.\n\nThe use of the pictorial elements of painting such as line and color to convey an ultimate unifying theme or idea was regarded as the highest expression of art, and an idealism was adopted in art, whereby forms seen in nature would be generalized, and in turn subordinated to the unity of the artwork. It aimed at universal truth through the imitation of nature. Later dissenting theorists, such as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, held that this focus on allegory was faulty and based on a wrong analogy between the plastic arts and poetry rooted in the Horatian dictum ut pictura poesis (\"as is painting so is poetry\").\n\nThe British painter Sir Joshua Reynolds in his \"Discourses\" of the 1770s and 1780s, reiterated the argument for still life to the lowest position in the hierarchy of genres on the grounds that it interfered with the painter's access to central forms, those products of the mind's generalising powers. At the summit reigned history painting, centred on the human body: familiarity with the forms of the body permitted the mind of the painter, by comparing innumerable instances of the human form, to abstract from it those typical or central features that represented the body's essence or ideal.\n\nThough Reynolds agreed with FÃ©libien about the natural order of the genres, he held that an important work from any genre of painting could be produced under the hand of genius: \"Whether it is the human figure, an animal, or even inanimate objects, there is nothing, however unpromising in appearance, but may be raised into dignity, convey sentiment, and produce emotion, in the hands of a painter of genius. What was said of Virgil, that he threw even the dung about the ground with an air of dignity, may be applied to Titian; whatever he touched, however naturally mean, and habitually familiar, by a kind of magic he invested with grandeur and importance.\"\n\nThough European academies usually strictly insisted on this hierarchy, over their reign, many artists were able to invent new genres which raised the lower subjects to the importance of history painting. Reynolds himself achieved this by inventing the portraiture style that was called the Grand Manner, where he flattered his sitters by likening them to mythological characters. Jean-Antoine Watteau invented a genre that was called fÃªtes galantes, where he would show scenes of courtly amusements taking place in Arcadian setting; these often had a poetic and allegorical quality which were considered to ennoble them. \n\nClaude Lorrain practised a genre called the ideal landscape, where a composition would be loosely based on nature and dotted with classical ruins as a setting for a biblical or historical theme. It artfully combined landscape and history painting, thereby legitimising the former. It is synonymous with the term \"historical landscape\" which received official recognition in the AcadÃ©mie franÃ§aise when a Prix de Rome for the genre was established in 1817. Finally, Jean-Baptiste-SimÃ©on Chardin was able to create still life paintings that were considered to have the charm and beauty as to be placed alongside the best allegorical subjects. However, aware of this hierarchy, Chardin began including figures in his work in about 1730, mainly women and children.\n\nRomanticism greatly increased the status of landscape painting, beginning in British art and more gradually that of genre painting, which began to influence history painting in the anecdotal treatments of the Style Troubadour in France and equivalent trends elsewhere. Landscapes grew in size to reflect their new importance, often matching history paintings, especially in the American Hudson River School and Russian painting. Animal paintings also increased in size and dignity, but the full-length portrait, even of royalty, became mostly reserved for large public buildings.\n\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, women were largely unable to paint history paintings as they were not allowed to participate in the final process of artistic trainingâthat of life drawing, in order to protect their modesty. They could work from reliefs, prints, casts and from the Old Masters, but not from the nude model. Instead they were encouraged to participate in the lower painting forms such as portraiture, landscape and genre. These were considered more feminine in that they appealed to the eye rather than the mind.\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, painters and critics began to rebel against the many rules of the AcadÃ©mie franÃ§aise, including the status accorded to history painting, which was beginning to be bought mainly by public bodies of one sort or another, as private buyers preferred subjects from lower down the hierarchy. In Britain the Pre-Raphaelite movement tried to revitalize the history painting, with mixed success; other movements made similar efforts. Many Pre-Raphaelites ended their careers mainly painting other subjects. New artistic movements included the Realists and Impressionists, which each sought to depict the present moment and daily life as observed by the eye, and unattatched from historical significance; the Realists often choosing genre painting and still life, while the Impressionists would most often focus on landscapes.\n\n"}

{"id": "732612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=732612", "title": "National Endowment for the Humanities", "text": "National Endowment for the Humanities\n\nThe National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) is an independent federal agency of the U.S.Â government, established by the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 (), dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities. The NEH is housed at 400 7th St SW, Washington, D.C. From 1979 to 2014, NEH was at 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. in the Nancy Hanks Center at the Old Post Office.\n\nThe NEH provides grants for high-quality humanities projects to cultural institutions such as museums, archives, libraries, colleges, universities, public television, and radio stations, and to individual scholars.\n\nNEH was created in 1965 under the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities, which included the National Endowment for the Arts and later the Institute for Museum Services, as a move to provide greater investment in culture by the federal government. NEH was based upon recommendation of the National Commission on the Humanities, convened in 1963 with representatives from three US scholarly and educational associations.\n\nThe agency creates incentives for excellent work in the humanities by awarding grants that strengthen teaching and learning in the humanities in schools and colleges across the nation, facilitate research and original scholarship, provide opportunities for lifelong learning, preserve and provide access to cultural and educational resources and to strengthen the institutional base of the humanities. As part of its mandate to support humanities programs in every US state and territory, the agency supports a network of private, nonprofit affiliates, the 56 humanities councils in the states and territories of the United States.\n\nThe ninth NEH Chair was Jim Leach. President Obama nominated the former Iowa congressman, a Republican, to chair the NEH on June 3, 2009; the Senate confirmed his appointment in August 2009. Leach began his term as the NEH Chair on August 12, 2009 and stepped down in May 2013. Between November 2009 and May 2011, Leach conducted the American \"Civility Tour\" to call attention to the need to restore reason and civility back into politics, a goal that in his words was \"central to the humanities.\" Leach visited each of the 50 states, speaking at venues ranging from university and museum lecture halls to hospitals for veterans, to support the return of non-emotive, civil exchange and rational consideration of other viewpoints. According to Leach, \"Little is more important...than establishing an ethos of thoughtfulness and decency of expression in the public square. Words reflect emotion as well as meaning. They clarifyâor cloudâthought and energize action, sometimes bringing out the better angels in our nature, sometimes lesser instincts.\" Since the completion of Leach's Civility Tour, rallies for reasoning politics like Jon Stewart's Rally to Restore Sanity and grassroots initiatives for pluralistic rationalism in public discourse, have reflected Leach's call for civil, non-emotive and reasoning language between those with disparate religious or political ideologies.\n\nThe tenth Chair of the NEH was William 'Bro' Adams, who served from 2014 to 2017. President Obama nominated Adams on April 4, 2014; Adams was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote on July 9, 2014. Adams appointed Margaret (Peggy) Plympton as the Deputy NEH Chair in January 2015. \n\nBefore Adams's appointment, the NEH was headed by Acting Chair Carole M. Watson. Adams resigned his appointment on May 23, 2017, when he cited accomplishments under the \"Common Good\" initiative and the appointment of new administration officials.\n\nThe Endowment is directed by the NEH Chair. Advising the Chair is the National Council on the Humanities, a board of 26Â distinguished private citizens who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The National Council members serve staggered six-year terms.\n\nThe Endowment is directed by a Chair, who has legal authority to approve all recommendations and award grants and cooperative agreements. The Chair is nominated by the President and confirmed with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. The Chair's decisions are informed by recommendations from the National Council on the Humanities, peer-reviewers who are selected to read each project proposal submitted to the Endowment, as well as by the Endowment's staff.\n\nThe NEH has seven grant-making divisions and offices:\n\n\nThese are special priorities of the endowment that indicate critical areas of the humanities as identified by the NEH Chair. They differ from the divisions of the endowment in that they do not sponsor or coordinate specific grant programs.\n\nBridging Cultures is an NEH initiative that explores ways the humanities promote understanding and mutual respect for people with diverse histories, cultures, and perspectives. Projects supported through this initiative focus on cultures globally as well as within the United States. International projects might seek to enlarge Americans' understanding of other places and times, as well as other perspectives and intellectual traditions. American projects might explore the great variety of cultural influences on, and myriad subcultures within, American society. \n\nThese projects might investigate how Americans have approached and attempted to surmount seemingly unbridgeable cultural divides or examine the ideals of civility and civic discourse. In connection with a focus on civic discourse, projects might explore the role of women in America's civic life as well as the civic role of women in other cultures and regions of the world.\n\nThis initiative, launched in 2014, marks a priority to make awards that promote understanding of the military experience and to support returning veterans.\n\n\"We the People\" was an NEH special funding stream initiated by NEH Chair Coles, using dedicated funds available to each Chair of the NEH, which was designed to encourage and enhance the teaching, study, and understanding of American history, culture, and democratic principles. The initiative supports projects and programs that explore significant events and themes in American nation's history, which advance knowledge of the principles that define America.\n\nAccording to NEH, the initiative led a renaissance in knowledge about American history and principles among all US citizens. The initiative was launched on Constitution Day, September 17, 2002 and active through 2009.\n\nSince 1965, the NEH has sponsored many projects, including:\n\nSince 1972 the NEH has sponsored the Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, which it describes as \"the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities.\" The Jefferson Lecturer is selected each year by the National Council on the Humanities. The honoree delivers a lecture in Washington, D.C., during the spring, and receives an honorarium of $10,000. The stated purpose of the honor is to recognize \"an individual who has made significant scholarly contributions in the humanities and who has the ability to communicate the knowledge and wisdom of the humanities in a broadly appealing way.\"\n\nThe National Humanities Medal, inaugurated in 1997, honors individuals or groups whose work has deepened the nation's understanding of the humanities, broadened citizens' engagement with the humanities, or helped preserve and expand Americans' access to important resources in the humanities. Up to 12Â medals can be awarded each year. From 1989 to 1996 the NEH awarded a similar prize known as the Charles Frankel Prize. The new award, a bronze medallion, was designed by David Macaulay, the 1995 winner of the Frankel Prize. Lists of the winners of the National Humanities Medal and the Frankel Prize are available at the NEH website.\n\nStarting in 1969, the NEH published a periodical called \"Humanities\"; that original incarnation was discontinued in 1978. In 1980, \"Humanities\" magazine was relaunched (). It is published six times per year, with one cover article each year dedicated to profiling that year's Jefferson Lecturer. Most of its articles have some connection to NEH activities. The magazine's editor since 2007 has been journalist and author David Skinner. From 1990 until her death in 2007, \"Humanities\" was edited by Mary Lou Beatty (who had previously been a high-ranking editor at the \"Washington Post\").\n\n\n"}
{"id": "904791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=904791", "title": "On a Clear Day You Can See Forever", "text": "On a Clear Day You Can See Forever\n\nOn a Clear Day You Can See Forever is a musical with music by Burton Lane and a book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner based loosely on \"Berkeley Square\", written in 1929 by John L. Balderston. It concerns a woman who has ESP and has been reincarnated. The musical received three Tony Award nominations.\n\nThe Broadway production opened at the Mark Hellinger Theatre on October 17, 1965 and closed on June 11, 1966 after 280 performances and 3 previews. The production was directed by Robert Lewis, choreographed by Herbert Ross, and starred Barbara Harris as Daisy Gamble/Melinda, John Cullum as Dr. Mark Bruckner, Clifford David as Edward Moncrief, Titos Vandis as Themistocles Kriakos, and William Daniels as Warren Smith. Louis Jourdan was the original leading man when the show had its tryout at the Colonial Theatre in Boston but was replaced by Cullum before it reached Broadway. Scenic design was by Oliver Smith and costume design was by Freddy Wittop. The show was not well received. Ben Brantley of the \"New York Times\" recalled: \"Its book was strained and muddled, most critics agreed; its big production numbers were simply cumbersome. But it did have [a] lushly melodic score...\" Tours followed starring Tammy Grimes, Linda Lavin, Van Johnson and Nancy Dussault.\n\nA 1970 film adaptation directed by Vincente Minnelli starred Barbra Streisand, Yves Montand, and Jack Nicholson.\n\nIn February 2000, the New York City Center Encores! series presented a staged concert starring Kristin Chenoweth as Daisy/Melinda and Peter Friedman as Dr. Bruckner. The show premiered in London in 2000 at the Bridewell Theatre.\n\nA revised Broadway production began previews on November 12, 2011 at the St. James Theatre and opened on December 11, 2011, directed by Michael Mayer and with a new book by Peter Parnell. Harry Connick Jr. starred as Dr. Mark Bruckner. The cast included Jessie Mueller as Melinda and David Turner as David Gamble. The revised version, which had a developmental workshop at The Vineyard Theatre in the fall of 2009 and had readings in August 2010 at the Powerhouse Theater at Vassar College, departed from the plot of the original. The patient is now a gay florist David (Turner) who was a female jazz singer Melinda (Mueller) in a former life, and who falls in love with his psychiatrist, widower Dr. Mark Bruckner (Connick). The Vassar concert mixed \"material from the stage and film versions and eliminates overstuffed 1960s-style production numbers.\" This production closed on January 29, 2012 after 29 previews and 57 performances.\n\n\"On A Clear Day You Can See Forever\" was revived at the Union Theatre in London starring Vicki Lee Taylor as Daisy Gamble and Nadeem Crowe as Dr. Mark Bruckner. The production was directed by Kirk Jameson and opened to rave reviews with the run ending on 28 September 2013.\n\nThe 2011 revised Broadway version was revived at The New Conservatory Theater Center in San Francisco, California starring Chris Morell as David Gamble, Melissa O'Keefe as Melinda Wells, and popular local actor William Giammona as Dr. Mark Bruckner. The production was directed by Artistic Director and Founder, Ed Decker, with music direction by Matthew Lee Cannon, choreography by Jayne Zaban and featuring new instrumental arrangements by Ben Prince. It opened May 21, 2016.\n\nPorchlight Music Theatre presented this show as a part of their \"Porchlight Revisits\" season where they stage three forgotten musicals per year. It was in Chicago, Illinois in May of 2017. It was directed by Lili-Anne Brown. \n\nQuirky Daisy Gamble sees herself as an unremarkable person and has low self-esteem, even though she can (1) make plants grow remarkably, (2) predict when a telephone will ring or someone will drop in, and (3) tell where to find an object that someone else is looking for. Her current problem, though, is her nasty smoking habit, which will interfere with the chances of her fiancÃ©, Warren, for a job with great benefits. She seeks help from a psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Bruckner, to stop smoking. When he hypnotizes her, she describes living a previous life in late 18th century England as \"Melinda Wells\", who died in her late twenties from circumstances beyond her control. Free spirited Melinda was in love with portrait painter Edward Moncrief. Dr. Mark keeps to himself what Daisy has revealed to him, and he tells her that she should not be ashamed of her ESP.\n\nAt their next session, Daisy, under hypnosis, relates scenes from the salacious London Hellrakers' Club where Melinda met Edward. Melinda and Edward eventually marry, but the painter is unfaithful to her, making love to his subjects. Mark, the psychiatrist, finds himself falling for \"Melinda\" and becomes convinced that Daisy is really the reincarnation of Melinda. Melinda finally left Edward and set sail for America, but the ship never reached Boston. Before Mark can save Melinda from shipwreck, Daisy wakes up.\n\nMark reports on the case to his fellow psychiatrists, who ridicule his findings. Greek shipping magnate Themistocles Kriakos learns of Mark's belief in reincarnation and offers to finance a study of the events of Melinda's life in exchange for Mark's help in discovering who he will be in his next life, which will allow him to leave his fortune to his future self. Daisy accidentally discovers that she is the \"Melinda\" at the center of the growing controversy and that Mark prefers Melinda to herself. In her angry confrontation with the psychiatrist about the matter, she tells him that she is \"through being a go-between for you and your dream girl. You're not going to go on using my head for a motel.\" \n\nDaisy goes to the airport, ready to return home. Her ESP powers warn her that the plane on which she plans to travel will crash. She realizes at last how special she really is. She leaves her starchy fiancÃ© (Come Back To Me) and she and Mark unite to explore their extraordinary future.\n\nThe musical is available in at least two noticeably different published versions (aside from the film version), although the basic plot-line remains the same. The first version was published in 1966. The musical numbers recorded in the original Broadway cast album of 1965 correspond to this version. \n\nA second version is evident in the piano-vocal score published in 1967. Here several vocal numbers from the above version are missing (\"Ring Out the Bells,\" \"Tosy and Cosh\", \"Don't Tamper with my Sister\"), as is the introduction to the song \"Hurry, It's Lovely Up Here,\" which is recorded on the cast album. Also, the Greek millionaire's solo, \"When I'm Being Born Again\" is given completely different lyrics (\"When I Come Around Again\") and sung instead by Daisy's friends. The overture recorded on the cast album combines the \"overture\" and \"entr'acte\" printed in the vocal score.\n\nThe 1970 film version departed from the musical significantly, adding a character for Jack Nicholson (an ex-stepbrother named \"Tad\"), and changing details of other characters, moving the period of Melinda's life ahead by a decade or two (into the early 19th century), removing several songs, changing lyrics and adding two new songs.\n\n\n\n\nâ  Songs taken from the musical film Royal Wedding.\n\nNote: In the piano-vocal score, a song appears that was not included in the original Broadway production: \"The Solicitor's Song\", during Daisy's first regression-scene. There was also a ballet in the first act of the original production, entitled \"At the Hellrakers\" and the song \"Ring Out the Bells\" that are not found on the original Broadway recording.\n\nThe title song has been recorded by a number of artists, including Robert Goulet, Johnny Mathis, baseball pitcher Denny McLain, and by Sergio Franchi on his 1976 DynaHouse and TeleHouse albums; Barbra Streisand, star of the 1970 film version, recorded the title song on the film's soundtrack. Sammy Davis Jr. has also performed the title song live in concert, and Harry James released a version in 1967 on his album \"Our Leader!\" (Dot DLP 3801 and DLP 25801). In 2012, The Peddlers' 1968 jazz cover was used in season 5 episode 3 (\"Hazard Pay\") of AMC-TV's \"Breaking Bad\" over a montage of Walt and Jesse's meth manufacturing. \n\n\"What Did I Have That I Don't Have\" was covered with some success by Eydie Gorme and was also sung by Streisand on the soundtrack on the film version. \"Come Back to Me\" was recorded by swing revival band the Cherry Poppin' Daddies in 1994, which later appeared on their multi-platinum 1997 compilation \"Zoot Suit Riot\" and was re-recorded for their 2014 Rat Pack tribute \"Please Return the Evening\".\n\nThe title song is reminiscent of Ravel's \"Dawn\" movement from his ballet \"Daphnis et ChloÃ©\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1427451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1427451", "title": "Oto-Manguean languages", "text": "Oto-Manguean languages\n\nOto-Manguean languages (also Otomanguean) are a large family comprising several subfamilies of indigenous languages of the Americas. All of the Oto-Manguean languages that are now spoken are indigenous to Mexico, but the Manguean branch of the family, which is now extinct, was spoken as far south as Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Oto-Manguean is widely viewed as a proven language family. However, this status has been recently challenged (Brown 2015).\n\nThe highest number of speakers of Oto-Manguean languages today are found in the state of Oaxaca where the two largest branches, the Zapotecan and Mixtecan languages, are spoken by almost 1.5 million people combined. In central Mexico, particularly in the states of Mexico, Hidalgo and QuerÃ©taro, the languages of the Oto-Pamean branch are spoken: the Otomi and the closely related Mazahua have over 500,000 speakers combined. Some Oto-Manguean languages are moribund or highly endangered; for example, Ixcatec and Matlatzinca each has fewer than 250 speakers, most of whom are elderly. Other languages particularly of the Manguean branch which was spoken outside of Mexico have become extinct; these include the Chiapanec language, which has only recently been declared extinct. Others such as Subtiaba, which was most closely related to Me'phaa (Tlapanec), have been extinct longer and are only known from early 20th century descriptions.\n\nThe Oto-Manguean language family is the most diverse and most geographically widespread language family represented in Mesoamerica. The internal diversity is comparable with that of Indo-European, and the Proto-Oto-Manguean language is estimated to have been spoken some time before 2000 BCE. This means that at least for the past 4000 years Oto-Manguean languages have coexisted with the other languages of Mesoamerica and have developed many traits in common with these, to such an extent that they are seen as part of a sprachbund called the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area. However Oto-Manguean also stands out from the other language families of Mesoamerica in several features. It is the only language family in North America, Mesoamerica and Central America whose members are all tonal languages. It also stands out by having a much more analytic structure than other Mesoamerican languages. Another typical trait of Oto-Manguean is that its members almost all show VSO (verbâsubjectâobject) in basic order of clausal constituents.\n\nA genetic relationship between Zapotecan and Mixtecan was first proposed by Manuel Orozco y Berra in 1864, he also included Cuicatec, Chocho and Amuzgo in his grouping. In 1865 Pimentel added Mazatec, Popoloca, Chatino and Chinantec â he also posed a separate group of Pame, Otomi and Mazahua, the beginning of the Oto-Pamean subbranch. Daniel Brinton's classification of 1891 added Matlatzinca and Chichimeca Jonaz to Pimentel's Oto-Pamean group (which wasn't known by that name then), and he reclassified some languages of the previously included languages of the Oaxacan group. In 1920 Walther Lehmann included the ChiapanecâMangue languages and correctly established the major subgroupings of the Oaxacan group. And in 1926 Schmidt coined the name OtomiâMangue for a group consisting of the Oto-Pamean languages and ChiapanecâMangue. The Oto-Pamean group and the Main Oaxacan group were not joined together into one family until Sapir's classification in 1929, where it was included in the Hokan family.\n\nFrom the 1950s on reconstructive work began to be done on individual Oto-Manguean language groups. Proto-Oto-Pamean was reconstructed by Doris Bartholomew, Proto-Zapotecan by Morris Swadesh, Proto-ChiapanecâMangue by FernÃ¡ndez de Miranda and Weitlaner.The classification by Campbell 1997 was the first to present a unified view of the Oto-Manguean languages. In 1981 William Merrifield published a reconstruction of the kinship terminologies of each of the Oto-Manguean branches and of Proto-Oto-Manguean. Unpublished reconstructions of Proto-Oto-Manguean grammar have also been made by Terrence Kaufman.\nIn spite of the lack of a full published reconstruction of proto-Oto-Manguean, the language family has now been widely accepted by specialists, including Lyle Campbell, Terrence Kaufman, and William Poser. Campbell and Poser writing in 2008 concluded that \"Tlapanec-Subtiaba proved not to belong to 'Hokan' as postulated by Sapir (1925a), but to be a branch of Otomanguean ...\" Nonetheless a few studies have retained the inclusion in Hokan, particularly Joseph Greenberg's widely rejected 1987 classification, as well as its derivative works by Merritt Ruhlen. Writing in 1988, Leonardo Manrique still listed Tlapanec-Mangue as an isolated family.\n\nThe status of the Amuzgo language as either a part of the Mixtecan group or as forming its own branch from the proto-Oto-Manguean node has been discussed by Longacre, who argued for the latter, but the currently most accepted classification by Campbell (1997) follows Terrence Kaufman in considering Amuzgo to be a branch of Mixtecan. Swadesh (1960) and Rensch included the Huave language as a separate branch within Oto-Manguean, but this inclusion has proved untenable as most of the cognates were loan-words from Zapotec. Huave is now considered an isolate.\n\nLongacre (1968) considered Oto-Manguean to be among the most extensively studied language families of the world, with a level reconstruction rivaling the Indo-European family in completeness, but Kaufman and Justeson (2009) reject this, lamenting the rudimentary reconstruction of Proto-Oto-Manguean lexicon (only c. 350 items have been reconstructed) and grammar. They call for a redoubling of the effort to document and reconstruct several important branches that have received little attention: principally Mixtecan, Popolocan and Oto-Pamean.\n\nBrown (2015) evaluates evidence assembled in support of Oto-Manguean. He points out that vocabulary reconstructed for Proto-Oto-Manguean is not supported by regular sound correspondences. While scholars, including Swadesh, Rensch, and Kaufman, have all reconstructed POM words, none have done so with the benefit of detailed sound correspondences and, consequently Brown argues that their reconstructions as well as Oto-Manguean itself are called into question. Nevertheless, Brown (2015) suggests that Oto-Manguean as Sprachbund (language diffusion area) is a reasonable alternative hypothesis to the proposal of Oto-Manguean as a language family.\n\nSome early classifications such as that by Brinton, considered that Oto-Manguean languages might be related to Chinese, because like Chinese the languages were tonal and mostly monosyllabic. This idea was quickly abandoned as it was discovered that tonal languages are common, and advances in the historical study of Chinese were made (including the discovery that Old Chinese was non-tonal). Edward Sapir included SubtiabaâTlapanec in his Hokan phylum, but didn't classify the other Oto-Manguean languages in his famous 1929 classification. In his 1960 classification, Joseph Greenberg considered Oto-Manguean so aberrant from other Native American languages that it was the only accepted family (aside from the PurÃ©pecha isolate) which he made a primary branch of his Amerind family. However, in his 1987 revision he linked it with Aztec-Tanoan in a \"Central Amerind\" branch, apart from Tlapanec which, although it had by then been unequivocally linked to Oto-Manguean, he continued to classify as Hokan. No hypotheses including Oto-Manguean in any higher-level unit have been able to withstand scrutiny.\n\nThe Oto-Manguean family has existed in southern Mexico at least since 2000 BCE and probably several thousand years before, some estimates using the controversial method of glottochronology suggest an approximate splitting date of Proto-Otomanguean at c. 4400 BCE. This makes the Oto-Manguean family the language family of the Americas with the deepest time depth, as well as the oldest language family with evidence of tonal contrast in the proto-language.\n\nThe Oto-Manguean urheimat has been thought to be in the TehuacÃ¡n valley in connection with one of the earliest neolithic cultures of Mesoamerica, and although it is now in doubt whether TehuacÃ¡n was the original home of the Proto-Otomanguean people, it is agreed that the TehuacÃ¡n culture (5000 BCEâ2300 BCE) were likely Oto-Mangue speakers.\n\nThe long history of the Oto-Manguean family has resulted in considerable linguistic diversity between the branches of the family. Terrence Kaufman compares the diversity between the main branches of Oto-Manguean with that between the main branches of Indo-European. Kaufman also proposes that Oto-Manguean languages are an important candidate for being the source of many of the traits that have diffused into the other languages in the Mesoamerican linguistic area.\n\nOto-Mangue speakers have been among the earliest to form highly complex cultures of Mesoamerica: the archeological site of Monte AlbÃ¡n with remains dated as early as 1000 BCE is believed to have been in continuous use by Zapotecs. The undeciphered Zapotec script is one of the earliest forms of Mesoamerican writing.\n\nOther Mesoamerican cultural centers which may have been wholly or partly Oto-Manguean include the late classical sites of Xochicalco, which may have been built by Matlatzincas, and Cholula, which may have been inhabited by Manguean peoples. And some propose an Oto-Pamean presence in TeotihuacÃ¡n. The Zapotecs are among the candidates to have invented the first writing system of Mesoamerica â and in the Post-Classic period the Mixtecs were prolific artesans and codex painters. During the postclassic the Oto-Manguean cultures of Central Mexico became marginalized by the intruding Nahuas and some, like the ChiapanecâMangue speakers went south into Guerrero, Chiapas and Central America, while others such as the Otomi saw themselves relocated from their ancient homes in the Valley of Mexico to the less fertile highlands on the rim of the valleys.\n\nThe languages of the Oto-Pamean branch are spoken in central and western Mexico. The group includes the Otomian languages: Otomi spoken primarily in the states of Mexico, Hidalgo, Puebla and Veracruz (c. 293,000 speakers) and Mazahua spoken in the western part of the State of Mexico (c. 350,000 speakers), and the endangered Matlatzincan languages including Matlatzinca (c. 1000 speakers in the town of San Francisco Oxtotilpa) and Tlahuica (also called Ocuilteco) (c. 400 speakers in the municipio of Ocuilan) both spoken in the State of Mexico; And the Pamean group composed of the two living Pame languages of San LuÃ­s PotosÃ­, Northern Pame being spoken in communities from the north of RÃ­o Verde on the border with Tamaulipas (c. 5500 speakers), and Central Pame spoken in the town of Santa MarÃ­a Acapulco (c. 4000 speakers), the extinct Southern Pame language, and the Chichimeca Jonaz language spoken in MisiÃ³n de Chichimecas near San Luis de la Paz in the state of Guanajuato (c. 200 speakers).\n\nOtomi is traditionally described as a single language, although its many dialects are not all mutually intelligible. The language classification of the SIL International's Ethnologue considers Otomi to be a cover term for nine separate Otomi languages and assigns a different ISO code to each of these nine varieties. Currently Otomi varieties are spoken collectively by c. 239,000 speakers â some 5 to 6 percent of whom are monolingual. Because of recent migratory patterns, small populations of Otomi speakers can be found in new locations throughout Mexico and in the United States. The Otomi languages are vigorous in some areas, with children acquiring the language through natural transmission (e.g. in the Mezquital Valley of Hidalgo and in the Highlands). However three varieties are now considered moribund: those of Ixtenco (Tlaxcala state), Santiago Tilapa and Acazulco (Mexico state), and Cruz del Palmar (Guanajuato state). In some municipalities the level of monolingualism in Otomi is as high as 22.3% (Huehuetla, Hidalgo) or 13.1% (Texcatepec, Veracruz). Monolingualism is normally significantly higher among women than among men.\n\nThe Chinantecan languages are spoken by c. 93,000 people in Northern Oaxaca and Southern Veracruz in the districts of CuicatlÃ¡n, IxtlÃ¡n de JuÃ¡rez, Tuxtepec and Choapan. The Ethnologue recognizes 14 separate varieties with separate ISO codes.\n\nThe Tlapanec language is spoken by c. 75,000 people in Guerrero. There are four principal varieties named after the communities where they are spoken: Acatepec, AzoyÃº, Malinaltepec and Tlacoapa. Recent labor migrations have introduced Tlapanec speaking communities to the state of Morelos. It was closely related to the Subtiaba language which was spoken in Nicaragua but which is now extinct.\n\nThe Manguean languages are all extinct. They included the Mangue and Chorotega languages that were spoken in Nicaragua and Costa Rica at the beginning of the 20th century, and the Chiapanec language which was spoken in Chiapas, Mexico by a handful of speakers in the 1990s, but is now extinct.\n\nThe Popolocan language group includes the seven different varieties of Popoloca which are spoken in southern Puebla state near TehuacÃ¡n and Tepexi de RodrÃ­guez (c. 30,000 speakers), and the closely related Chocho language (c. 700 speakers) spoken in Northern Oaxaca state, and the 8 different Mazatecan languages spoken in northern Oaxaca (c. 120,000 speakers), and the nearly extinct Ixcatec language spoken in Santa MarÃ­a IxcatlÃ¡n (< 8 speakers). The Popolocan languages should not be confused with the languages called Popoluca spoken in the state of Veracruz, which belong to the unrelated MixeâZoquean language family. The Mazatecan languages are known for their prolific use of whistled speech.\n\nThe Zapotecan subgroup is formed by the Zapotec languages (c. 785,000 speakers of all varieties) and the related Chatino languages (c. 23,000 speakers). They are all traditionally spoken in central and southern Oaxaca, but have been spread throughout Mexico and even into the United States through recent labor related migrations.\n\nZapotec languages and dialects fall into four broad geographic divisions: Zapoteco de la Sierra Norte (Northern Zapotec), Valley Zapotec, Zapoteco de la Sierra Sur (Southern Zapotec), and Isthmus Zapotec. Northern Zapotec languages are spoken in the mountainous region of Oaxaca, in the Northern Sierra Madre mountain ranges; Southern Zapotec languages and are spoken in the mountainous region of Oaxaca, in the Southern Sierra Madre mountain ranges; Valley Zapotec languages are spoken in the Valley of Oaxaca, and Isthmus Zapotec languages are spoken in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The Ethnologue recognizes 57 varieties of Zapotec and 6 varieties of Chatino by distinct ISO codes.\n\nThe Mixtecan branch includes the many different, mutually unintelligible varieties of Mixtec spoken by about 511,000 people as well as the Trique (or Triqui) languages, spoken by about 24,500 people and Cuicatec, spoken by about 15,000 people. The Mixtecan languages are traditionally spoken in the region known as La Mixteca, which is shared by the states of Oaxaca, Puebla and Guerrero. Because of migration from this region the Mixtecan languages have expanded to Mexico's main urban areas, particularly the State of MÃ©xico and the Federal District, to certain agricultural areas such as the San QuintÃ­n valley in Baja California and parts of Morelos and Sonora, and even into the United States. The Mixtec language is a complex set of regional varieties, many of which are not mutually intelligible. The varieties of Mixtec are sometimes grouped by geographic area, using designations such as those of the Mixteca Alta, the Mixteca Baja, and the Mixteca de la Costa. However, the dialects do not actually follow the geographic areas, and the precise historical relationships between the different varieties have not been worked out. The number of varieties of Mixtec depends in part on what the criteria are for grouping them, of course; at one extreme, government agencies once recognized no dialectal diversity. Mutual intelligibility surveys and local literacy programs have led SIL International to identify more than 50 varieties which have been assigned distinct ISO codes.\n\nFour Amuzgo varieties are spoken in the Costa Chica region of the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca by about 44,000 speakers. The four varieties recognized by the Mexican government are: Northern Amuzgo (amuzgo del norte, commonly known as Guerrero or (from its major town) Xochistlahuaca Amuzgo), Southern Amuzgo (amuzgo del sur, heretofore classified as a subdialect of Northern Amuzgo); Upper Eastern Amuzgo (amuzgo alto del este, commonly known as Oaxaca Amuzgo or San Pedro Amuzgos Amuzgo); Lower Eastern Amuzgo (amuzgo bajo del este, commonly known as Ipalapa Amuzgo). These varieties are very similar, but there is a significant difference between western varieties (Northern and Southern) and eastern varieties (Upper Eastern and Lower Eastern), as revealed by recorded text testing done in the 1970s.\n\nAll Oto-Manguean languages have tone: some have only two level tones while others have up to five level tones. Many languages in addition have a number of contour tones. Many Oto-Manguean languages have phonemic vowel nasalization. Many Oto-Manguean languages lack labial consonants, particularly stops and those that do have labial stops normally have these as a reflex of Proto-Oto-Manguean .\n\nProto-Oto-Manguean allowed only open syllables of the structure CV (or ). Syllable initial consonant clusters are very limited, usually only sibilant-CV, CyV, CwV, nasal-CV, ChV, or are allowed. Many modern Oto-Manguean languages keep these restrictions in syllable structure but others, most notably the Oto-Pamean languages, now allow both final clusters and long syllable initial clusters. This example with three initial and three final consonants is from Northern Pame: \"their houses\".\n\nThe following phonemes are reconstructed for Proto-Oto-Manguean.\n\nRensch also reconstructs four tones for Proto-Oto-Manguean. A later revised reconstruction by Terrence Kaufman adds the proto-phonemes */ts/, */'/, */'/, */'/, */'/, */'/, */'/ and *//, and the vowel combinations */ia/, */ai/, */ea/, and */au/.\n\nThe Oto-Manguean languages have changed quite a lot from the very spartan phoneme inventory of Proto-Oto-Manguean. Many languages have rich inventories of both vowels and consonants. Many have a full series of fricatives, and some branches (particularly Zapotecan and Chinantecan) distinguish voicing in both stops and fricatives. The voiced series of the Oto-Pamean languages have both fricative and stop allophones. Otomian also have full series of front, central and back vowels. Some analyses of Mixtecan include a series of voiced prenasalised stops and affricates; these can also be analysed as consonant sequences but it would be the only consonant clusters known in the languages.\n\nThese are some of the most simple sound changes that have served to divide the Oto-Manguean family into subbranches:\n\nThe Oto-Manguean languages have a wide range of tonal systems, some with as many as 10 tone contrasts and others with only two. Some languages have a register system only distinguishing tones by the relative pitch. Others have a contour system that also distinguishes tones with gliding pitch. Most however are combinations of the register and contour systems. Tone as a distinguishing feature is entrenched in the structure of the Oto-Manguean languages and in no way a peripheral phenomenon as it is in some languages that are known to have acquired tone recently or which are in a process of losing it. In most Oto-Manguean languages tone serves to distinguish both between the meanings of roots and to indicate different grammatical categories. In Chiquihuitlan Mazatec which has four tones the following minimal pairs occur: \"\" \"I talk\", \"Â²\" \"difficult\", \"Â³\" \"his hand\" \"\" \"he talks\".\n\nThe language with the most level tones is Usila Chinantec which has five level tones and no contour tones; Trique of Chicahuaxtla has a similar system.\nIn Copala Trique, which has a mixed system, only three level tones but five tonal registers are distinguished within the contour tones.\nMany other systems have only three tones levels, such as Tlapanec and Texmelucan Zapotec.\n\nParticularly common in the Oto-Pamean branch are small tonal systems with only two level tones and one combination, such as Pame and Otomi. Some others like Matlatzinca and Chichimeca Jonaz only have the level tones and no combination.\nIn some languages stress influences tone, for example in Pame only stressed syllables have a tonal contrast. In Chatino where stress falls predictably on the last syllable of polysyllables, tone is also only distinguished on the last syllable. In Mazahua the opposite occurs and all syllables except the final stressed one distinguishes tone. In Tlapanec stress is determined by the tonal contour of the words. Most languages have systems of sandhi where the tones of a word or syllable are influenced by other tones in other syllables or words. Chinantec has no Sandhi rules but Mixtec and Zapotec have elaborate systems. For Mazatec some dialects has elaborate Sandhi systems (e.g. Soyaltepec) and others have not (e.g. Huautla Mazatec). Some languages (particularly Mixtecan) also have terrace systems where some tones are \"upstep\" or \"downstep\", causing a raise or drop in pitch level for the entire tonal register in subsequent syllables.\n\nSeveral Oto-Manguean languages have systems of whistled speech, where by whistling the tonal combinations of words and phrases, information can be transmitted over distances without using words. Whistled speech is particularly common in Chinantec, Mazatec and Zapotecan languages.\n\n"}

They are one of Indonesia's finest example of metalworking. Examples of Bronze Age Pejeng drum, such as the ancient Moon of Pejeng, is the largest bronze drum in the world, indicating the advance of metal casting technique and the active trade in the archipelago in the first millennium AD.\n\nThe first record of the use of bronze and iron in the Indonesian archipelago was around 500 BC. Most of the earliest bronze objects were probably used for ceremonies e.g. highly-stylized axes and kettledrums. Some drums were shaped in a form known as the Dong Son, a type of bronze drum which originate from northern Vietnam and are spread along the Sunda Islands e.g. Sumatra, Java, Nusa Tenggara and even as far as the Kai Islands near Papua. The spread of the Dong Son drum in the Indonesian archipelago indicates an extensive trade among the kingdoms in Southeast Asia during the period. Other bronze drums found in the archipelago represented local variation, the most well-known of these are the Pejeng drums.\n\nThe Pejeng drums, named after the Bronze Age village of Pejeng in Bali, were the Indonesian variation of the Dong Son drum. Pejeng drums differ from the earlier Dong Son drum in that they had a more elongated shape and were made in two pieces (mantles and tympana) cast separately using the lost wax method. Pejeng drum was designed in the Indonesian archipelago and was produced extensively in the island of Java and Bali in the first millennium AD. The Balinese variation is among the most impressive metal artifact in the late prehistoric period of Indonesia. The Moon of Pejeng kept in the village of Pejeng, is the largest Pejeng drum in the world. Such enormous drum would have had great social value for the owners. Neither copper nor tin, the raw materials for bronze making, are available in Bali. The existence of huge bronze drums in Bali indicates an intensive inter-island trade between Bali and other parts of Indonesia during the first millennium AD. Trade was also more expansive in Bali, as pottery decorated with Indian-styled rouletted designs, were found at Sembiran and Pacung in the north part of Bali, indicating a trade as far as India within the archipelago in the 1st or 2nd centuries AD.\n\nPejeng drums may have been used as a regalia by kings or chiefs who wanted to be considered an international elite. At Plawangan, a Pejeng drum was found in burials, together with other precious objects e.g. gold necklace and iron spearhead. In Bali, the Moon of Pejeng, the largest drum of this type, was simply kept in villages. The Moko drum of Alor, a Pejeng-type drum, are still used as heirloom objects which are exchanged in marriage ceremonies.\n\nA Pejeng drum has a symmetrical appearance. Its shape consists of three parts: the head or the tympanum at the top, the middle barrel where the handle is attached, and the base. The design difference between the Pejeng drum and the Dong Son drum is that the tympanum protrudes around beyond the body, and was cast separately from it.\n\nPejeng drums were made using lost-wax casting. Another difference with the Dong Son drum is that the body and tympana of the Pejeng drum were sometimes cast separately instead of as a whole. A wax model in the shape of a drum was made around a hollow clay core. The standardized geometric pattern of human or animal were impressed into the wax using incised stone molds. The geometric patterns were molded onto for the tympana and the upper sides.\n\n"}

{"id": "51393701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51393701", "title": "Revisionist school of Islamic studies", "text": "Revisionist school of Islamic studies\n\nThe Revisionist school of Islamic studies, (also Historical-Critical school of Islamic studies) is a movement within Islamic studies which started in the 1970s and initiated a paradigm shift in Islamic Studies.\n\nThe core concern of the Revisionist School is to finally show consequence concerning the knowledge, practically available since IgnÃ¡c Goldziher's time, that the traditional Islamic accounts about Islam's early times - written 150 to 200 years after Muhammad - are highly questionable as historical sources. This relates to Muhammad's biography, the formation history of the Quran, and the historical developments under the first Islamic dynasty, the Umayyad Caliphate. The true historical events in the earliest times of Islam have to be newly researched and reconstructed by applying the historical-critical method.\n\nThe designation \"Revisionism\" was coined first by the opponents of the new academic movement and is used by them partially still today with a dismissive undertone. Then, the media took up this designation in order to call the new movement with a concise catchword. Today, also the adherents of the new movement use \"Revisionism\" to designate themselves, yet mostly written in quotation marks and with a slightly self-mocking undertone.\n\nThe new movement originated at the SOAS, University of London by two publications of John Wansbrough: \"Quranic Studies\" (1977) and \"The Sectarian Milieu\" (1978). Among the students of Wansbrough are: Andrew Rippin, Norman Calder, G. R. Hawting, Patricia Crone and Michael Cook. With their work \"Hagarism\" (1977) Patricia Crone and Michael Cook set a milestone in Islamic Studies, since by provocative theses they provided maximal attention in the academic community. Later, both distanced themselves from their too far reaching theses in \"Hagarism\". Yet they adhered to the basically new academic approach. Martin Hinds, too, studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. Robert G. Hoyland is a student of Patricia Crone.\n\nA second local focus of the new movement is at the Saarland University in SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany (). Since the 1970s there is a focus on the historical-critical research of the development of the Quran, by GÃ¼nter LÃ¼ling und Gerd-RÃ¼diger Puin. Also in SaarbrÃ¼cken, Karl-Heinz Ohlig developed in the 2000s together with Volker Popp, Christoph Luxenberg and Markus GroÃ a theory of Islam's earliest times which has no need for Muhammad as a historical person.\n\nFurther representatives are: Hans Jansen from the Netherlands who in 2005/7 published a work showing in detail why the known accounts of Muhammad's life are legends only. Yehuda D. Nevo published in 2003 his work \"Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State\" in which he denies the historicity of Muhammad. James A. Bellamy is known for his textual criticism of the Quran and for his proposals of emendations, i.e. proposals to correct the traditional text of the Quran. Fred Donner published in 2010 the first well-founded hypothesis on the early time of Islam without excessive exaggerations which found public attention.\n\nTom Holland studied history and became a renowned author of popular science publications on ancient history. With his work \"In the Shadow of the Sword\" (2012) Tom Holland contributed heavily to the popularization of the new research results. Tom Holland depicts a possible synthesis of the various revisionist approaches, thus having like Fred Donner provided a well-founded hypothesis of Islam's early times which avoids exaggerations.\n\nSven Kalisch is a German Islamic theologian who rejected teaching Islamic theology without considering the new results of historical-critical research. Thereupon the German Islamic associations withdrew his allowance to teach future Islamic theologians and teachers. Later Kalisch left Islam. Today he is teaching the history of ideas in the Near East in Late Antiquity in MÃ¼nster.\n\nThe arguments against the credibility of the classical Islamic traditions about Islam's beginnings were e.g. summarized by Prof. Hans Jansen in his work \"De Historische Mohammed\". Jansen discusses chapter by chapter the depictions in the prophet's biography by Ibn Ishaq resp. Ibn Hisham which is an important text for traditional Islam. Jansen reveals self-contradictions, contradictions to other historical sources, embellishments by later authors, politically or theologically motivated distortions of the depiction, symbolic meanings of allegedly historical names, literary construction of the depiction according e.g. to biblical models, and chronological and calendrical incredibilities.\n\nSome examples:\n\n\nJansen points out that the historically questionable traditions are of great importance for the interpretation of the Quran. The Quran mostly does not reveal the situation for which a revelation was made. The historical context is merely indicated, at best. Many Islamic traditions came into being long after Muhammad on the basis of mere guesses for what situation a Quranic verse had been revealed. Because these historically questionable traditions, the interpretation of the Quran has been restricted ever since.\n\nIn her work \"Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam\" Patricia Crone gave a general examination of the credibility of Islamic traditions. This examination is much cited in literature yet discusses only a few aspects of Muhammad's biography meant to be exemplary for the nature of all the Islamic traditions. Concerning the encounter of the young Muhammad with Jews who recognize him as a prophet, and other stories, Patricia Crone writes: \"\"\"These stories are no different from those on Muhammad's encounter with Jews and others. Being non-miraculous, they do not violate any laws of nature, of course, and in that sense they could be true. In fact, they are clearly not. [...] We cannot even tell whether there \"was\" an original event: in the case of Muhammad's encounter with the Jews and others there was not. Either a fictitious theme has acquired reality thanks to the activities of storytellers or else a historical event has been swamped by these activities.\"\"\n\nStarting point for all researchers is the awareness that the traditional Islamic accounts about Islam's beginnings which came into being only 150 to 200 years after Muhammad are highly questionable as historical sources. The true events in early Islamic times have to be newly researched and reconstructed with the help of the historical-critical method. In the following the theses of the revisionists in broad outline:\n\n\nThe consequent historical-critical analysis of early Islam met severe resistance in the beginning since then provocative theses with far-reaching meaning were published without sufficient evidence. Especially Patricia Crone's and Michael Cook's book \"Hagarism\" (1977) stirred up a lot of harsh criticism. Important representatives of Revisionism like Patricia Crone or Michael Cook meanwhile distanced themselves from such radical theses and uncautious publications.\nCriticism is expressed by researchers like Tilman Nagel, who aims at the speculative nature of some theses and shows that some revisionists lack some scholarly standards. On the other hand, Nagel accepts the basic impulse of the new movement, to put more emphasis on the application of the historical-critical method. \nA certain tendency to take revisionists seriously becomes obvious e.g. by the fact that opponents address their criticism not any longer to \"revisionism\" alone but to \"extreme revisionism\" or \"ultra-revisionism\".\n\nGregor Schoeler discusses the revisionist school and depicts the early controversies. Schoeler considers revisionism to be too radical yet welcomes the general impulse: \"To have made us thinking about this all and much more remarkable things for the first time -- or again, is without any doubt a merit of the new generation of the 'skeptics'.\"\n\nResistance comes partly from older academics who still live in their thoughts in the world of the Islamic legends. As Thomas S. Kuhn in his famous work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962) described, a new paradigm prevails in academia often not by convincing current academics but by convincing the next generation of academics.\n\nContinuous resistance against the new paradigm comes from researchers who fundamentally reject the application of the historical-critical method to Islamic texts. They argue that this method was developed for Christian texts and thus there is no reason to apply this method to Islamic texts, too. Adherents of Revisionism doubt whether this still is a scientific point of view.\n\nThe relationship between religion and science had always been shaped by conflicts... It is always a hurting process for every religion to realize that parts of its teachings were wrong: at the beginning, new scientific results are often considered to be an attack on religion itself; only later is it realized that religion can live with the new findings, so long as the religion's core is not affected, and things are sorted out in the way of religious reforms.\n\nBy nature new findings about the early times of Islam touch the identity of the Islamic religion. Thus it is a justified claim of religious people that any research concerning their religion has to progress with high diligence and cautiousness in order to avoid unnecessary irritations. At the same time it is a justified claim by academics that they can do their research freely and without any restraint, even if the results run contrary to religious teachings.\n\nThe gravity of irritation provided to Islam depends on the question whether core teachings of Islam are touched or not, especially the historicity of Muhammad and the attribution of the Quran to Muhammad. According to this question, the historical-critical school can roughly be divided into two groups (for details see the researchers' articles):\n\nBesides the discussion of the historicity of Muhammad as a historical person and the Quranic text attributed to him, Islam faces the following debates:\n\nIbn Warraq, an author known for his criticism of Islam, has complied several revisionist essays in his book, \"The Quest for the Historical Muhammad.\" Fred Donner, reviewing the book, notes that by favoring Wansbrough school of revisionism, the author presents a \"one-sided selection\" that fails to consider the challenges to this line of revisionism. The results is \"a book that is likely to mislead many an unwary general reader.\" Robert Spencer, in this book \"Did Muhammad Exist? An Inquiry Into Islam's Obscure Origins,\" advances the thesis that Islam was a state-religion created by the Abbasids to justify the empire.\n\n\n\n"}

It is held in a private collection.\n\nThe painting depicts the recognisable view of Saint-Paul-de-Vence, one of the oldest medieval towns on the French Riviera, dominated by the church at its top. The work is particularly rich in color and has a very balanced composition. The blue sky above the town contains a large, bright yellow sun as well as various other elements from the artistâs iconography â animals, musicians and the flying couple. By juxtaposing this imagery, Soleil dans le ciel de Saint-Paul combines Chagallâs love of his Mediterranean home with his characteristic dream-like pictorial vision. With its free-flowing style and bright, translucent colours, the work exemplifies the effect that the south of France had on Chagallâs art. âThe Southern French landscape has astonished Chagall with its wealth of colours and its lyrical atmosphere, had captivated him with the beauty of its flowers and foliage. These impressions found their way into his paintings of that period, refined their peinture and lent them a hitherto unknown radianceâ.\n\nWith its fantastical, dream-like composition, the painting becomes an expression of the artistâs internal feelings and souvenirs rather than an objective projection of the outside world and of the familiar landscape. As such, Chagallâs paintings defy symbolic meaning and categorisation. In particular, his dreamscapes resist interpretation despite the ubiquity of repeated pictorial symbols; through repetition they become both familiar and meaningless, manifestations of a rich and colourful imagination that can be understood not through intellect but through intuition. As the artist himself proclaimed: âFor me a picture is a surface covered with representations of things (objects, animals, human beings) in a certain order in which logic and illustration have no importance. The visual effect of the composition is what is paramountâ.\n\nThe painting served as inspiration for an ensemble from the Valentino Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2015 Show. Chagall's Russian ancestry provided a leitmotif for the embellishments that are central to the designer's aesthetic.\n\n"}
{"id": "21905326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21905326", "title": "Sportswear (fashion)", "text": "Sportswear (fashion)\n\nSportswear is an American fashion term originally used to describe separates, but which, since the 1930s, has come to be applied to day and evening fashions of varying degrees of formality that demonstrate a specific relaxed approach to their design, while remaining appropriate for a wide range of social occasions. The term is not necessarily synonymous with activewear, clothing designed specifically for participants in sporting pursuits. Although sports clothing was available from European haute couture houses and \"sporty\" garments were increasingly worn as everyday or informal wear, the early American sportswear designers were associated with ready-to-wear manufacturers. While most fashions in America in the early 20th century were directly copied from, or influenced heavily by Paris, American sportswear became a home-grown exception to this rule, and could be described as the American Look. Sportswear was designed to be easy to look after, with accessible fastenings that enabled a modern emancipated woman to dress herself without a maid's assistance.\n\nSportswear has been called America's main contribution to the history of fashion design, developed to cater to the needs of the increasingly fast-paced lifestyle of American women. It started out as a fashion industry term describing informal and interchangeable separates (i.e., blouses, shirts, skirts and shorts), and in the 1920s became a popular word for relaxed, casual wear typically worn for spectator sports. Since the 1930s the term has been used to describe both day and evening fashions of varying degrees of formality that demonstrate this relaxed approach while remaining appropriate wear for many business or social occasions.\n\nThe curator Richard Martin put on an exhibition on sportswear in 1985 at the Fashion Institute of Technology, in which he described sportswear as \"an American invention, an American industry, and an American expression of style.\" For Martin, American sportswear was an expression of various predominantly middle-class aspects of American culture, including health ideals, the concept of democracy, ideas of comfort and function, and innovative design which might refer to historical concepts or leisure attributes. The establishment of a five-day working week and an eight-hour working day in America in the mid-20th century led to the need for clothing which enabled the fullest possible enjoyment of such increased leisure time, and was designed accordingly. A subsequent exhibition of 1930s-70s sportswear, also curated by Martin, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1998, was introduced by Philippe de Montebello as showing pioneering garments, whose modesty, comparative simplicity, and wearability treated fashion as a \"pragmatic art.\" de Montebello carefully explained how significant American designers such as Norman Norell, Pauline TrigÃ¨re, Charles James and Mainbocher, were not considered sportswear designers, as they were not dedicated to the design principles of versatility, accessibility and affordability in the way that Claire McCardell or Emily Wilkens were.\n\nThe \"American Look,\" which is an alternative term for American sportswear, was coined in 1932 by Lord & Taylor executive Dorothy Shaver.\n\nSportswear originally described activewear - clothing made specifically for sport. Part of the evolution of sportswear was triggered by 19th-century developments in female activewear, such as early bathing or cycling costumes, which demanded shorter skirts, bloomers, and other specific garments to enable mobility, whilst sports such as tennis or croquet could be played in barely-modified conventional dress. One of the first couturiers to specialise in sports-specific clothing was the British John Redfern who in the 1870s began designing tailored garments for increasingly active women who rode, played tennis, went yachting, and did archery. Redfern's clothes, although intended for specific sporting pursuits, were adopted as everyday wear by his clients, making him probably the first sportswear designer. Also in the late nineteenth century, garments associated with activewear and/or modified from menswear, such as the shirtwaist began to form part of the working woman's wardrobe. Prior to 1920, men and women could both demonstrate their being at leisure simply by removing a jacket, either literally in the case of menswear, or metaphorically by a woman wearing a shirtwaist blouse that resembled a man's shirt worn without a jacket.\n\nMartin has observed that in America, prior to increasing worker freedoms from the mid-late 19th century onwards, leisure had been a luxury available only to the leisured classes during the Industrial Revolution (c.1760-1860), and before that, Puritan America had condemned leisure for all. He cites the 1884 Georges Seurat painting \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\" as an immobile, \"static and stratified\" depiction of leisure in \"direct antithesis\" of the relaxed, casual American equivalent. T.J. Clarke notes how \"La Grande Jatte\" illustrates people from the breadth of Paris society taking advantage of their free time by going to the riverside to show off new clothes, but that the act of removing one's jacket or otherwise loosening garments as a signifier of actually being at leisure was almost never done.\n\nWhile 1920s Paris designers offered haute couture designs that could be considered sportswear, it was typically not their design focus. A notable exception was the tennis player Jane RÃ©gny (the pseudonym of Madame Balouzet Tillard de Tigny), who opened a couture house specialising in clothing for sport and travel. Another famous tennis player, Suzanne Lenglen, was director of the sportswear department at Jean Patou. In contrast to the flexibility of American sportswear, these expensive couture garments were typically prescribed for very specific circumstances. Many couturiers began designing clothing that, whilst suitable for sport, could be worn in a wider range of contexts. Coco Chanel, who promoted her own active, financially independent lifestyle through relaxed jersey suits and uncluttered dresses, became famous for clothes of \"the sports type.\" In 1926 \"Harper's Bazaar\" reported upon Chanel's sporty garments, noting the absence of equivalent apparel from New York fashion presentations. However, Martin has noted that while Chanel was undeniably important and influential, her work was always based on couture construction rather than the easy-wear nature of American sportswear. \n\nAs more generic, versatile sportswear became more prominent in the Paris collections, the press increasingly promoted the wearing of such garments in an everyday context. By the mid-1920s, American advertisers also began actively pushing the idea that sporty clothing was just as appropriate for regular daywear as it was for active pursuits, presenting it as the epitome of modernity and the American ideal. One advertisement put out by Abercrombie & Fitch in \"Vogue\" in 1929 suggested that while men might admire a girl in an glamorous evening gown, they would be less intimidated by her approachable, friendly appearance in good-quality sportswear. Sportswear was also presented as an accessible version of resort wear, a term for the luxurious travelling clothing and holiday wear worn by those who could afford a leisurely lifestyle with multiple vacations, such as cruises, yachting, and skiing. Affordable, well-designed all-American sportswear was presented as a way of enabling a less wealthy customer to feel part of that same lifestyle. However, at first, American apparel firms mostly copied French styles.\n\nDespite the acceptance of fashionable sportswear as a form of casual dressing in French fashion in the 1920s, the American garment industry went on to become the most prominent producers of such clothing. The key difference between French and American sportswear was that French sportswear was usually a small part of a high-end designer's output, while the American sportswear designers focused on affordable, versatile, easy-care garments that could be mass-produced and were relevant to the customer's lifestyle, enabling the modern, increasingly emancipated woman to dress herself without a maid's assistance. Although the influence of Europe, particularly Parisian high fashion and English tailoring, was always significant, the Great Depression which started in 1929 acted as a trigger to encourage American fashion to focus on homegrown style and design - particularly sportswear. With 13 million Americans left unemployed by the Depression, it was necessary to create jobs and reduce the competition from imported goods in order to improve the American economy. At the same time, the growth of female athleticism and increased female employment fueled a need for simpler and less expensive clothing.\nThe precursors of true sportswear emerged in New York before the Second World War. Clare Potter and Claire McCardell were among the first American designers in the 1930s to gain name recognition through their innovative clothing designs, which Martin described as demonstrating \"problem-solving ingenuity and realistic lifestyle applications\". Garments were designed to be easy-to-wear and comfortable, using practical fabrics such as denim, cotton, and jersey. McCardell in particular has been described as America's greatest sportswear designer. Her simple, practical clothes suited the relaxed American dress code, neither formal nor informal, that became established during the 1930s and 1940s. McCardell once proclaimed: \"I belong to a mass production country where any of us, all of us, deserve the right to good fashion.\" Martin credits the 1930s and 40s sportswear designers with freeing American fashion from the need to copy Paris couture. Where Paris fashion was traditionally imposed onto the customer regardless of her wishes, American sportswear was democratic, widely available, and encouraged self-expression. The early sportswear designers proved that the creation of original ready-to-wear fashion could be a legitimate design art which responded stylishly to utilitarian requirements.\n\nMany of the first sportswear designers were women, including McCardell, Potter, Elizabeth Hawes, Emily Wilkens, Tina Leser, and Vera Maxwell. A common argument was that female designers projected their personal values into this new style. One of the few male designers at this time was Tom Brigance, who by the late 1930s was regularly ranked alongside Potter as a leading name in mid-range priced sportswear. Like Potter, Brigance understood how to design smart and fashionable clothing for mass-production, which made his clothes attractive to manufacturers as well as to customers. Two other notable male designers of sportswear at this time were Sydney Wragge and John Weitz.\n\nIn the 1930s and '40s, it was rare for clothing to be justified through its practicality. It was traditionally thought that Paris fashion exemplified beauty, and therefore, sportswear required different criteria for assessment. The designer's personal life was therefore linked to their sportswear designs. Another selling point was sportswear's popularity with consumers, with department store representatives such as Dorothy Shaver of Lord & Taylor using sales figures to back up their claims. Maxwell and Potter were two of the first three sportswear designers, along with Helen Cookman, to be showcased and name-checked in Shaver's window displays and advertisements for Lord & Taylor. Between 1932 and 1939, Shaver's \"American Look\" program at Lord & Taylor promoted over sixty American designers including McCardell, Potter and Merry Hull. Shaver advertised her American designers as if they were French couturiers, and promoted their lower costs as a positive feature, rather than a sign of inferiority. One of Shaver's retail experiments was a 'College Shop' section in the store, opened in the early 1930s and run by her assistant Helen Maddock, with the intent of offering casual but flattering clothing to young female college students. The stock, however, ended up selling swiftly to adult women as well as to the students.\n\nAmong the key designs produced by this new generation of American designers were capsule wardrobes such as McCardell's group of five wool jersey pieces from 1934, comprising two tops, long and short skirts, and a pair of culottes; and Maxwell's \"weekend wardrobe\" of five tweed and flannel garments. Both were designed to accommodate formal and informal occasions depending on how they were assembled and accessorised. McCardell also became well known for designs such as the Monastic and Popover dresses which were versatile enough to work in multiple contexts from swimsuit cover-ups to party dresses. Other McCardell signatures included ballet slippers (made by Ben Sommers of Capezio) as everyday footwear and functional pockets in skirts and trousers. Dressy garments made from casual fabrics, such as McCardell and Joset Walker's evening dresses and dress-and-coat ensembles made out of cotton, became a key sportswear look. The American couturier Norman Norell declared that McCardell could make a smart dress to wear anywhere out of \"five dollars worth of common cotton calico.\" Other sportswear designs often incorporated elements of sporty informal or casual wear, as exemplified by Clare Potter's evening sweater worn with a long skirt draped like a sidesaddle riding habit.\n\nAlongside Dorothy Shaver, Eleanor Lambert was an important promoter of the American Look and sportswear. As founder of the Council of Fashion Designers of America and creator of New York Fashion Week, Lambert is considered the first fashion publicist. In the summer of 1940, Lambert was hired by the Dress Institute to promote American fashion, leading to newspaper and magazine articles about how New York was replacing Paris as a global fashion leader. In 1940, both \"Harper's Bazaar\" and \"Vogue\" published issues devoted to American fashion.\n\nRebecca Arnold and Emily S. Rosenberg have noted how the American look, demonstrated through healthy teeth and the use of affordable, good-quality fashionable clothing to present a neat and practical appearance, despite claims of egalitarianism, was ultimately held up against white standards of beauty. Rosenberg has pointed out a six-page spread in \"LIFE\" dated May 21, 1945, which explicitly described girls with an athletic 'American look' of good teeth, good grooming, and good, not-too-masculine, simple, neat attire, as being seen as preferable to girls from England, France, Australia or Polynesia.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the emergence in Paris of the luxurious \"New Look\" popularised by Christian Dior, with its emphasis on accessorising and femininity, was in direct contrast to the relaxed, easy-wear American look. Sally Kirkland, a fashion editor at \"Vogue\" and \"LIFE\", noted that McCardell and others had already been thinking along the lines of longer and fuller skirts and fitted bodices, but that unlike Dior's heavily stiffened and corseted designs, they used bias-cut bodices and lightweight, easy-wear circle or pleated skirts to reproduce the same silhouette. Unlike traditional made-to-measure French couture fashion, designed for specific silhouettes, American sportswear was designed to accommodate a variety of body shapes and enable freedom of movement. With the lifting of fabric rationing and restrictions following the War, American designers were able to use unlimited fabric and the development of permanent pleating meant that pleated dresses and full skirts were easy to look after. In addition to this, American stores had begun to recognise the commercial value of separates, with \"LIFE\" reporting in 1949 that separates made up an all-time-high of 30% of clothing sales in the States that Fall.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, designers continued to develop the theme of affordable, practical and innovative sportswear, producing clothing that focused on wearability rather than fashion fads, including Anne Fogarty's coat-and-dress sets and dresses made with removable waistcoats to alter their look. The film costume designer Bonnie Cashin, who started producing ready-to-wear clothing in 1949, is considered one of the most influential American sportswear designers. She was known for her extremely practical layered ensembles inspired by ethnographic garments and textiles such as the Japanese kimono and happi, ikats, and the South American poncho. Her designs incorporated leather bindings, pockets with purse clasps, hooded jersey dresses and tops, and industrial zippers and fastenings. She put a brass clip resembling those used on dog leashes, on a long formal skirt so that it could be securely hitched up to enable the wearer to run up and down stairs, and her ponchoes and hoods (which could be rolled down to form elegant cowl-collars) were originally designed for driving on cool mornings. Cashin became one of the first American designers to have an international reputation. Alongside Cashin, Rudi Gernreich emerged in the 1950s as a key name in sportswear design, first becoming known for his swimsuits, but then expanding into geometrically cut, graphic clothes and knitwear that Kirkland described as the epitome of the \"new California.\"\n\nAlong with many other designers, Gernreich took advantage of the development in the mid-1950s of upgraded machine-knitting techniques to produce his work. Double knitting (which was developed in Italy) enabled the mass-production of easy-to-wear knitted suits, coats and dresses that retained their shape and became a key American look in the 1960s and '70s. Another knitwear development involved varying the lines of the classic T-shirt so that it could be extended into dress-length versions, long or short sleeves, and other variations, including, by 1960, a sequined long evening version by Kasper for Arnold & Fox. In the 1960s, American sportswear depended on very simple shapes, often made in vivid colours and bold, geometric prints (such as those by Gernreich and Donald Brooks).\n\nTowards the end of the 1960s, many sportswear designers such as Anne Klein and Halston began to enter business independently, rather than relying on the backing of their manufacturers, or working in association with firms and companies.\n\nIn a 1974 essay titled \"Recession Dressing,\" the writer Kennedy Fraser noted how Halston's work, particularly his success with making basic garments in luxurious fabrics, was that of an \"anti-designer\" who liberated American women of fashion from needlessly elaborate, conventional high fashion from high-end establishment American designers. She also singled out Clovis Ruffin and Stephen Burrows. Alongside Calvin Klein, Jhane Barnes, and Ralph Lauren, Martin has described Halston, Ruffin and Burrows as \"paragons\" of 1970s and early 1980s Seventh Avenue sportswear style.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Lauren, Calvin Klein and Perry Ellis became particularly known for their sportswear designs, made in all-natural fibres such as wool, combed cotton, and linen, which placed them at the top tier of American fashion design alongside the Anne Klein label (designed by Donna Karan and Louis Dell'Olio). \"Newsweek\" in 1975 described Calvin Klein as having styled his clean, casual separates with the authority of a couture designer, and by 1985, Martin described him as \"one of the great American stylists\" with a solid international reputation and worldwide influence entirely based on his skills as a sportswear designer. The industry empires of Lauren and Calvin Klein would be joined in the mid-1980s by Donna Karan's own-name label and Tommy Hilfiger, each of whom created distinctive wardrobes for the American woman based upon stylish but wearable, comfortable and interchangeable multi-purpose clothes that combined practicability with luxury. These clothes were also designed to have a long, stylish and undated life, rather than to only be fashionable for one season. In 1976, the designer Zoran brought out the first of a number of collections of extremely simple garments made of the finest quality fabrics; garments that barely changed over the years and which became cult objects to his wealthy clientele. In 1993, the fashion journalist Suzy Menkes declared Zoran's less-is-more sportswear prophetic of the early 1990s modernist trend, whilst Zoran stated that the work of Calvin Klein, Karan, and the Anne Klein label epitomised the \"comfort, simplicity, and practicality\" associated with sportswear. Most early 21st century sportswear design follows in the footsteps of these designers. Other notable sportswear designers of the late 20th century include Norma Kamali, whose 1980s fashionable garments made from sweatshirt fabric were highly influential; Marc Jacobs, whose eponymous label renowned for layered informality in both day and evening wear was founded in 1986, and Isaac Mizrahi, who presented his first collection in 1987.\n\nIn the 1970s Geoffrey Beene, one of the first significant male sportswear designers, incorporated relaxed layering and elements of menswear into his women's clothing - details that continue to widely influence early 21st century industry designers. In 1970, Bill Blass, whose fashion career began in 1946, founded his own company, Bill Blass Limited. Blass's wearable designs were designed to be worn day and night and he was said to have raised American sportswear to the highest possible level. Like Beene, he introduced menswear touches to his sportswear, which was described as clean, modern and impeccable in style. Kirkland commented in 1985 that sportswear designers such as Liz Claiborne and Joan Vass were no longer \"borrowing from the boys,\" but had begun making menswear too. In addition to the high-end names who produced apparel in large quantity, a more personal level of sportswear was offered in the early 1980s by smaller designers such as Mary Jane Marcasiano and Vass, who specialised in hand-knits in wool and cotton. By the mid-1980s, sportswear had become a key part of the international fashion scene, forming a large part of America's contribution to the twice-yearly fashion presentations alongside top-end collections from Paris, Milan and London.\n\nIn 2000, the \"Lifestyle Monitor\", an American trade magazine owned by Cotton Incorporated published that their surveys showed that an average of 64% of women interviewed preferred casual wear, including sportswear as distinct from active wear.\n\nNotable New York sportswear designers of the first decade of the 21st century included Zac Posen, Proenza Schouler, Mary Ping, Derek Lam, and Behnaz Sarafpour, who were all featured in the Sportswear section of the Victoria and Albert Museum's \"New York Fashion Now\" exhibition in 2007.\n\nDesigners who do not typically work in the sportswear tradition such as Monique Lhuillier sometimes incorporate elements of sportswear and activewear into their work. Lhuillier, mainly known for formal gowns, introduced sporty necklines and aerodynamic elements into her collection for New York Fashion Week, Fall 2011.\n\nIn 2012 Tim Gunn noted that the boundaries between activewear and fashion sportswear had become increasingly blurred since the 1980s, with many people choosing to wear hoodies, tracksuits, yoga pants, and other garments explicitly associated with athletic wear as everyday dress.\n\nIn the late 1940s and 1950s non-American designers began to pay attention to sportswear, and attempted to produce collections following its principle. French couturiers including Dior and Fath simplified their designs for ready-to-wear production, but at first only the Italian designers understood the sportswear principle. Italy already had a reputation for fine fabrics and excellent workmanship, and the emergence of high quality Italian ready-to-wear that combined this luxury with the casual quality of American sportswear ensured the worldwide success of Italian fashion by the mid-1970s. Italian designers, including Emilio Pucci and Simonetta Visconti, grasped that there was a market for clothing that combined sophistication and comfort. This was a challenge to the American industry. John Fairchild, the outspoken publisher of \"Women's Wear Daily\" opined that Krizia, Missoni, and other Italian designers were \"the first to make refined sportswear.\"\n\nBefore co-founding the business that later became Missoni with his bride Rosita in 1953, Ottavio Missoni, himself an athlete, and his teammate Giorgio Oberweger had an activewear business in Trieste making wool tracksuits christened Venjulia suits. The success of the Venjulia suits, which took into account the need of athletes for functional, warm garments enabling freedom of movement, led to their being worn by the 1948 Italian Olympics team (which included Missoni himself). In the 1960s Missoni became renowned for their uniquely colored, mix-and-match knitwear separates based upon activewear, which have remained desirable and fashionable well into the 21st century.\n\nThe quality of Italian sportswear was recognized early on by Robert Goldworm, an American sportswear designer who in 1947 joined his New York-based family company Goldworm. Through his second company base in Milan, Goldworm became the first American knitwear designer to take advantage of Italian quality and bring it to the New York market. In 1959 Goldworm, in recognition of his active promotion and support of the Italian knitwear industry, was made a Commander of the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity by the Italian government.\n\nIn the 21st century, Italian fashion remains a leading source for sportswear design outside the United States. Narciso Rodriguez, who is known for streamlined and pared down clothing, launched in Milan in 1997, but moved to New York in 2001. Miuccia Prada revived the fortunes of her family company Prada with her top-quality sportswear designs in the 1990s, and continues designing for the firm.\n\nSuccessful British sportswear designers include Stella McCartney, known for her jumpsuits and easy-to-wear separates. McCartney was asked to design the athletic uniforms for the 2012 Summer Olympics, bringing fashionable sportswear design to the world of high-profile activewear.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27277250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27277250", "title": "Statistext", "text": "Statistext\n\nA statistext is a demographic category that is artificially contrived in pursuit of a political or ideological goal, particularly when categories are created that respondents would not otherwise apply to themselves. The term was created by Audrey Kobayashi, a Canadian geographer, in 1992.\n\nAccording to the Employment Equity Act of 1995, the definition of visible minority is:\n\nThis definition can be traced back to the 1984 Report of the Abella Commission on Equality in Employment. The Commission described the term visible minority as an \"ambiguous categorization\", but for practical purposes interpreted it to mean \"visibly non-white\". The Canadian government uses an operational definition where they classify as visible minorities the following groups: \"Blacks, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans, Latin Americans, Pacific Islanders, South Asians, and West Asians/Arabs.\" However, a few exceptions are applied to some groups, according to the explanation given by the \"Visible Minority Population and Population Group Reference Guide\" of the 2006 Census, the exception is:\n\nThe use of the term \"non-white\" controversially refers to those who are not considered by the Canadian government to be Caucasian, and does open the door to ambiguity. For example, people who are Lebanese, Berber, Latin American or South Asian may consider themselves to be white, yet the federal government forcibly imposes upon Arabs and Latin Americans the status of being visible minorities.\n\nExamples of statistexts used by the Canadian government include the forced categorization of non-Europeans as \"visible minorities\", particularly Caucasians from Western Asia, South Asia, and Latin America.\nAnother example of a statistext is the category \"Canadian\" as an ethnic choice on Canadian census forms. One demographer has speculated that as an ethnic identity, respondents might choose this to voice patriotism, or to rebel against ethnic classification, or to voice an anti-separatist opinion, and furthermore, that the term has very different connotations in English versus French. (See footnote 5 in.) An earlier version with a slightly different title is available at . These terms do not match the nomenclature such individuals would ordinarily apply to themselves, although sometimes statistexts gain acceptance among the people to whom the term is applied.\n\nThe nomenclature of minority groups has a number of effects. Statistexts can empower some ethnic or linguistic minorities in some instances, while marginalizing and prejudicing them in others. Some may be demoralized by the nomenclature applied to them, as when a Canadian feels the government-imposed \"visible minority\" label highlights oneâs \"outsider\" or \"exotic\" background. In other instances, nomenclature applied to a minority group may enable them to present a united front for political mobilization.\n\nAs well, these contrived categories lump together distinct groups that would not otherwise perceive each other as members of the same group.\n\nThe classification \"visible minorities\" has attracted controversy. In March 2007, the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination described the term as racist because it singles out a group.\n\nAnother criticism arises regarding the composition of \"visible minorities\" as defined by the Canadian government. Critics have noted that the groups comprising \"visible minorities\" have little in common with each other, as they include some disadvantaged ethnic groups and other groups who are not disadvantaged. The concept of visible minority has been cited in demography research as an example of a statistext, meaning a census category that has been contrived for a particular public policy purpose.\n\nSince 2008, census data and media reports have suggested that the \"visible minorities\" label no longer makes sense in some large Canadian cities due to immigration trends in recent decades. For example, \"visible minorities\" actually comprise the \"majority\" of the population in Toronto, Vancouver, Markham, Richmond, Burnaby, Greater Vancouver A, and Brampton. However, the term \"visible minority\" is used for the administration of the Employment Equity Act, and refers to its statistical reality in Canada as a whole and not any particular region.\n\nIn the United States, examples would be Hispanic and Latino Americans, Pacific Islander American and Asian American. The word \"Indian\", allegedly created by Christopher Columbus for the Indigenous people of the Americas, is another example of a statistext. While Columbus's use of this term initially had nothing to do with censuses, this contrivance did enable him to classify people in a way that coincided with the goal of finding a trade route to India.\n\n"}

Episodes are replete with references to tachyon beams, baryon sweeps, quantum fluctuations and event horizons. Many of the technologies created for the \"Star Trek\" universe were done so out of simple financial necessityâthe transporter was created because the limited budget of the in the 1960s did not allow expensive shots of spaceships landing on planets.\n\n\"Discovery Channel Magazine\" stated that cloaking devices, faster-than-light travel and dematerialized transport were only dreams at the time the original series was made, but physicist Michio Kaku believes all these things are possible. William Shatner, who portrayed James T. Kirk in the original \"Star Trek\" series, believed this as well, and went on to cowrite the book \"I'm Working on That\", in which he investigated how \"Star Trek\" technology was becoming feasible.\n\nIn the \"Star Trek\" fictional universe, subspace is a feature of space-time that facilitates faster-than-light transit, in the form of interstellar travel or the transmission of information. Subspace works similarly to the Alcubierre Drive, but obeys different laws of physics. Subspace has also been adopted and used in other fictional settings, such as the \"Stargate\" franchise, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" series, and \"\".\n\nIn most \"Star Trek\" series, subspace communications are a means to establish nearly instantaneous contact with people and places that are light years away. The physics of \"Star Trek\" describe infinite speed (expressed as Warp 10) as an impossibility; as such, even subspace communications which putatively travel at speeds over Warp 9.9 may take hours or weeks to reach certain destinations. Since subspace signals do not degrade with the square of the distance as do other methods of communication utilizing conventional bands of the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e. radio waves), signals sent from a great distance can be expected to reach their destination at a predictable time and with little relative degradation (barring any random subspace interference or spatial anomalies).\n\nSubspace communications have a limit of just over 20 light years before they must be boosted, although this limitation has been \"written around\" in several storylines.\n\n\n\n"}

Clemens was a nephew of the Roman Emperor Vespasian. He was the son of Titus Flavius Sabinus, consul \"suffectus\" in AD 69, and a brother of Titus Flavius Sabinus, consul in AD 82. The emperors Titus and Domitian were his cousins.\n\nAs a child, Clemens was besieged along with his family in the capitol, when the soldiers of his uncle, Vespasian, were approaching Rome. His father was captured and slain by the forces of Vitellius, who burnt the capitol, but the rest of the family escaped.\n\nClemens' brother was consul with Domitian, shortly after the latter's accession, but the emperor put his cousin to death on the pretext that the herald proclaiming him consul had called him \"Imperator\". In fact, the emperor was more likely motivated by his love for his cousin's wife, Julia Flavia (who, as the daughter of his brother Titus, was also his niece).\n\nClemens also married one of his cousins, Flavia Domitilla, daughter of Vespasian's daughter, Domitilla, who was thus also a niece of Domitian. They had two sons, whom Domitian intended to succeed him in the empire, renaming one of them \"Vespasian\" and the other \"Domitian\". However, in AD 95, when Clemens and the emperor were consuls, Domitian had his cousin put to death.\n\nAccording to Cassius Dio, Clemens was put to death on a charge of atheism, for which, he adds, many others who went over to the Jewish opinions were executed. This may imply that Clemens had converted to Judaism or Christianity, the former being more likely, and accompanied by circumcision. For the same reason, his wife was banished to Pandataria.\n\nTo this Clemens in all probability is dedicated the Basilica of San Clemente al Laterano, on the Caelian hill, which is believed to have been built originally in the fifth century, although its site is now occupied by a more recent, though very ancient, structure. In the year 1725 Cardinal Annibal Albani found under this church an inscription in honour of Flavius Clemens, martyr, which is described in a work called \"T. Flavii Clementis Viri Consularis et Martyris Tumulus illustratis\". Some connect Clemens with Clemens Romanus, perhaps the author of the Epistle to the Corinthians.\n\n"}

It stars Alexandra Powers as Tonya Harding and Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Kerrigan and focuses on the January 1994 attack on Kerrigan and the extensive media coverage surrounding the infamous incident. It was released on NBC in April 1994, based on public domain material.\n\nThe film portrays figure skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, and the extensive media coverage following the infamous 1994 attack on Kerrigan. It features a postmodern breaking of the fourth wall by having Dennis Boutsikaris play its screenwriter, addressing the audience over the course of the story. It also features, as labelled by \"Variety\", various \"witnesses\" of Greek chorus actors, discussing their perspectives of different issues and themes as they emerge in the story. One of the last lines in it is \"We imprisoned [Tonya and Nancy] in images we use to sell newspapers, soup, and TV movies. They're victims of those that the media serve\".\n\nWhen asked about her role as Tonya, Alexandra Powers stated \"In a lot of ways, it's the role of the year. Nothing like this ever happened in figure skating. Tonya and Nancy were all over the media, day in and day out. To me, Tonya has the best poker face I've ever seen. With all the controversy going down, she had a smile on her face. She still went to the Olympics. That makes an actor interested. She's either really innocent or deep in denial or she's insane.\"\n\nThe film premiered on NBC on April 30, 1994, with a rating of 10.4 and share of 19.\n\nRay Loynd of \"Variety\" stated that \"Tonya & Nancy: The Inside Story\" \"intelligently captures the chaos of the source material. The story may reek of moral squalor and may already be played out in the print and electronic media, but the moviemakers almost make it look fresh.\" He enjoyed how the \"\"Rashomon\"-style multiple viewpoints and array of talking witnesses, presented Ã  la the movie \"Reds\", continually propel the narrative\", giving it a satirical tone. Loynd liked how Alexandra Powers portrayed Harding as stranded between figure skating's culture of gentility and her rural heritage. He thought that the film did convey the pressures of competitive sports and the relentless demand to win. Loynd also admired the postmodern perspective of a scene with television network executives debating how to tell this very story.\n\nScott Williams of The Associated Press praised how writer Phil Penningroth framed the narrative cleverly, beginning with a close-up of Dennis Boutsikaris, as the film's screenwriter, musing \"Sometimes, I think this could be a fairy tale...one of those strange dark tales, where monsters eat little children.\" He liked that \"Tonya & Nancy: The Inside Story\" was \"interpretive\", and thought it was generally well crafted, acted, and sometimes poignant. Williams wrote that Alexandra Powers successfully portrayed Harding's insecurities and vulnerability, and that director Larry Shaw kept the story engaging. He also wrote that, although the film could have been \"a hasty 'ripped from the headlines' movie-of-the-week with cartoon characters...overacting stale emotions and restating public record\", \"Tonya & Nancy\" emerged as less of an \"evidence photo\" and more of a character study.\n\nJohn J. O'Connor of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the story held few surprises, yet he too admired Phil Penningroth's method of structuring the narrative. O'Connor liked the Dennis Boutsikaris character alluding to fairy tales while addressing the audience about Tonya and Nancy: \"Once upon a time there were two little girls...\" He praised how various perspectives were offered regarding the caricatures of \"Nancy the Good\" and \"Tonya the Bad\". O'Connor also enjoyed the metafictional scene of television network executives discussing how to produce \"Tonya & Nancy\": \"an ingenious ploy to undercut any suggestion of NBC cupidity\". He liked that the film commented about how the Olympic ideal has evolved and thought that James Wilder portrayed Jeff Gillooly as a compelling character. O'Connor believed that \"Tonya & Nancy: The Inside Story\" generally avoided the artifice of other docudramas that \"have a nasty habit of distorting facts.\" He also believed Harding was portrayed with fitting sympathy, as the film chronicled her undoing. The last line in the film was the screenwriter feeling sorry for her: \"Some fairy tales don't have a happy ending\".\n\nTom Jicha of the \"Sun-Sentinel\" also praised the film's narrative, but did not believe it offered an \"inside story\" with \"significant information\". He liked that two versions of Jeff Gillooly approaching the conspiracy meeting are presented, and that \"it is up to the viewer to sort out what to believe\". Jicha wrote that \"Tonya & Nancy: The Inside Story\" was \"more Tonya's story than Nancy's\", and noted that Harding's mother was portrayed as a greater \"domineering\" influence over Harding than Gillooly. He also liked that Nancy Kerrigan was represented compassionately with some dimension as she struggles with self-doubt. Jicha was also impressed that \"NBC doesn't spare itself\" in the cynical network executives scene.\n\nTom Shales of \"The Washington Post\" did not believe the film transcended the \"tedious account of that big news story all America is sick to death of\". Shales wrote that screenwriter Phil Penningroth did explore themes of celebrity, notoriety, and media ethics â but did so inadequately. He wrote that one of the weaknesses of the film was that none of the characters had a chance to be credible personalities. Shales thought that portions of the film bordered on clichÃ©, although he did concede to some effective comedic moments. He praised the performances of Powers and Langenkamp, stating \"Alexandra Powers and Heather Langenkamp do look like Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan and do passable impressions.\"\n\n\"The Baltimore Sun\" praised Langenkamp's portrayal of Kerrigan but was more negative towards Powers' performance stating \"Ms. Langenkamp wastes a decent performance here, but Alexandra Powers of \"L.A. Law\" is woefully miscast as Tonya Harding.\"\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" gave the film a negative review stating:\n"}
{"id": "143817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143817", "title": "Vortigern", "text": "Vortigern\n\nVortigern (; Old Welsh \"Guorthigirn\", \"Guorthegern\"; ; ; Old Breton \"Gurdiern\", \"Gurthiern\"; ; ), also spelled Vortiger, Vortigan, and Vortigen, was possibly a 5th-century warlord in Britain, known perhaps as a king of the Britons, at least connoted as such in the writings of Bede. His existence is nonetheless contested by scholars, and information about him is obscure.\n\nHe may have been the \"superbus tyrannus\" said to have invited Hengist and Horsa to aid him in fighting the Picts and the Scots. However, they revolted, killing his son in the process and forming the Kingdom of Kent. It is said that he took refuge in North Wales, and that his grave was in Dyfed or the LlÅ·n Peninsula. The historian Gildas denigrated Vortigern for his misjudgement and also blamed him for the loss of Britain. He is cited at the beginning of the genealogy of the early Kings of Powys\n\nThe 6th-century cleric and historian Gildas wrote \"De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae\" () in the first decades of the 6th century. In Chapter 23, he tells how \"all the councillors, together with \"that proud usurper\"\" [\"omnes consiliarii una cum superbo tyranno\"] made the mistake of inviting \"the fierce and impious Saxons\" to settle in Britain. According to Gildas, apparently, a small group came at first and was settled \"on the eastern side of the island, by the invitation of the unlucky [\"infaustus\"] usurper\". This small group invited more of their countrymen to join them, and the colony grew. Eventually the Saxons demanded that \"their monthly allotments\" be increased and, when their demands were eventually refused, broke their treaty and plundered the lands of the Romano-British.\n\nIt is not clear whether Gildas used the name Vortigern. Most editions published presently omit the name. Two manuscripts name him: \"MS. A\" (Avranches MS 162, 12th century), refers to \"Uortigerno\"; and \"Mommsen's MS. X\" (Cambridge University Library MS. Ff. I.27) (13th century) calls him \"Gurthigerno\". Gildas never addresses Vortigern as the king of Britain. He is termed a usurper (\"tyrannus\"), but not solely responsible for inviting the Saxons. To the contrary, he is portrayed as being aided by or aiding a \"Council\", which may be a government based on the representatives of all the \"cities\" (\"civitates\") or a part thereof. Gildas also does not consider Vortigern as bad; he just qualifies him as \"unlucky\" (\"infaustus\") and lacking judgement, which is understandable, as these mercenaries proved to be faithless.\n\nGildas adds several small details that suggest either he or his source received at least part of the story from the Anglo-Saxons. The first is when he describes the size of the initial party of Saxons, he states that they came in three \"cyulis\" (or \"keels\"), \"as they call ships of war\". This may be the earliest recovered word of English. The second detail is that he repeats that the visiting Saxons were \"foretold by a certain soothsayer among them, that they should occupy the country to which they were sailing three hundred years, and half of that time, a hundred and fifty years, should plunder and despoil the same.\" Both of these details are unlikely to have been invented by a Roman or Brittonic source.\n\nModern scholars have debated the various details of Gildas' story. One topic of discussion has been about the words Gildas uses to describe the Saxons' subsidies (\"annonas\", \"epimenia\") and whether they are legal terms used in a treaty of \"foederati\", a late Roman political practice of settling allied barbarian peoples within the boundaries of the empire to furnish troops to aid the defence of the empire. It is not known whether private individuals imitated this practice. It is also not known whether Gildas' reference to \"the eastern side of the island\" refers to Kent, East Anglia, the Kingdom of Northumbria or the entire east coast of Britain. Gildas describes how their raids took them \"sea to sea, heaped up by the eastern band of impious men; and as it devastated all the neighbouring cities and lands, did not cease after it had been kindled, until it burnt nearly the whole surface of the island, and licked the western ocean with its red and savage tongue\" (chapter 24).\n\nThe first extant text considering Gildas' account is Bede, writing in the early- to mid-8th century. He mostly paraphrases Gildas in his \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\" and \"The Reckoning of Time\", adding several details, perhaps most importantly the name of this \"proud tyrant\", whom he first calls \"Vertigernus\" (in his \"Chronica Maiora\") and later \"Vurtigernus\" (in his \"Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum\"). The \"Vertigernus\" form may reflect an earlier Celtic source or a lost version of Gildas. Bede also gives names in the \"Historia\" to the leaders of the Saxons, Hengist and Horsa, specifically identifying their tribes as the Saxons, Angles and Jutes (\"H.E.\", 1.14,15). Another significant detail that Bede adds to Gildas' account is calling Vortigern the king of the British people.\n\nBede also supplies the date, 449, which was traditionally accepted but has been considered suspect since the late 20th century: \"Marcian being made emperor with Valentinian, and the forty-sixth from Augustus, ruled the empire seven years.\" Michael Jones notes that there are several \"adventus\" dates in Bede. In H.E.Â 1.15 the adventus occurs within the period 449â455; in 1.23 and 5.23 another date, c. 446, is given; in 2.14 the same event is dated 446 or 447. These dates are apparently calculated approximations.\n\nThe \"Historia Brittonum\" (History of the Britons) was attributed until recently to Nennius, a monk from Bangor, Gwynedd, and was probably compiled during the early 9th century. The writer mentions a great number of sources. Nennius wrote more negatively of Vortigern, accusing him of incest (perhaps intentionally mistaking Vortigern for Vortiporius, accused by Gildas of the same crime), oath-breaking, treason, love for a pagan woman, and lesser vices such as pride.\n\nThe \"Historia Brittonum\" recounts many details about Vortigern and his sons. Chapters 31â49 tell how Vortigern (Guorthigirn) deals with the Saxons and Saint Germanus of Auxerre. Chapters 50â55 deal with Saint Patrick. Chapter 56 tells about King Arthur and his battles. Chapters 57â65 mention English genealogies, mingled with English and Welsh history. Chapter 66 gives important chronological calculations, mostly on Vortigern and the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.\n\nExcluding what is taken from Gildas, there are six groupings of traditions:\n\n\nThe \"Historia Brittonum\" relates four battles occurring in Kent, apparently related to material in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" (see below). It claims that Vortigern's son Vortimer commanded the Britons against Hengest's Saxons. Moreover, it claims that the Saxons were driven out of Britain, only to return at Vortigern's invitation a few years later, after the death of Vortimer.\n\nThe stories preserved in the \"Historia Brittonum\" reveal an attempt by one or more anonymous British scholars to provide more detail to this story, while struggling to accommodate the facts of the British tradition. This is important, as it indicates that near that time there were one or more Welsh kings who traced their genealogy back to Vortigern.\n\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" provides dates and locations of four battles which Hengest and his brother Horsa fought against the British in the county of Kent. Vortigern is said to have been the commander of the British for only the first battle; the opponents in the next three battles are variously termed \"British\" and \"Welsh\", which is not unusual for this part of the \"Chronicle\". No Saxon defeat is acknowledged, but the geographical sequence of the battles suggests a Saxon retreat. The \"Chronicle\" locates the Battle of Wippedesfleot as the place where the Saxons first landed, dated 465 in \"Wippedsfleot\" and thought to be Ebbsfleet near Ramsgate. The year 455 is the last date when Vortigern is mentioned. \n\nHowever, the \"Chronicle\" is not a single document but the end result of combining several sources over a period of time. The annals for the 5th century in the \"Chronicle\" were put into their current form during the 9th century, probably during the reign of Alfred the Great. The sources are obscure for the fifth century annals; however, an analysis of the text demonstrates some poetic conventions, so it is probable that they were derived from an oral tradition such as sagas in the form of epic poems.\n\nThere is dispute as to when the material was written which comprises the \"Historia Brittonum\", and it could be later than the \"Chronicle\". Some historians argue that the \"Historia Brittonum\" took its material from a source close to the \"Chronicle\".\n\nWriting soon before Geoffrey of Monmouth, Williamof Malmesbury added much to the damnatio memoriae of Vortigern: \n\nNo other sources confirm this evil description, and it seems safe to assume that this is an exaggeration of accusations made by earlier writers.\n\nWilliam does, however, add some detail, no doubt because of a good local knowledge. In \"De Gestis Regum Anglorum\" book I, chapter 23.\n\nThe story of Vortigern adopted its best-known form in Geoffrey's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\". Geoffrey states that he was the successor of Constans II, the son of usurping emperor Constantinus III. Further, Vortigern used Constans as a puppet monarch and ruled the nation through him until he finally managed to kill him through the use of insurgent Picts. \n\nGeoffrey mentions a similar tale just before that episode, however, which may be an unintentional duplication. Just after the Romans leave, the archbishop of London is put forward by the representatives of Britain to organise the island's defences. To do so, he arranges for continental soldiers to come to Britain. The name of the bishop is Guitelin, a name similar to the Vitalinus mentioned in the ancestry of Vortigern and to the Vitalinus said to have fought with Ambrosius at the Battle of Guoloph. This Guithelin/Vitalinus disappears from the story as soon as Vortigern arrives. All these coincidences imply that Geoffrey duplicated the story of the invitation of the Saxons, and that the tale of Guithelinus the archbishop might possibly give some insight into the background of Vortigern before his acquisition of power.\n\nGeoffrey is also the first to mention Hengest's daughter Rowena, who seduces Vortigern to marry her, after which his sons rebel. Geoffrey adds that Vortigern was succeeded briefly by his son Vortimer, as does the \"Historia Brittonum\", only to assume the throne again when Vortimer is killed.\n\nWhile Vortigern is mentioned only rarely by the later stories of King Arthur, when he does he is usually the character described by either Geoffrey of Monmouth or Wace.\n\nThe inscription on the Pillar of Eliseg, a mid-9th century stone cross in North Wales, gives the Old Welsh spelling of Vortigern: Guarthi[gern] (the inscription is now damaged and the final letters of the name are missing), believed to be the same person as Gildas' \"superbus tyrannus\", Vortigern. The pillar also states that he was married to Sevira, the daughter of Magnus Maximus, and gave a line of descent leading to the royal family of Powys, who erected the cross.\n\nIt is occasionally suggested by scholars that Vortigern could be a title rather than a personal name. The name in Brittonic literally means \"Great King\" or \"Overlord\", composed of the elements \"*wor-\" \"over-, super\" and \"*tigerno-\" \"king, lord, chief, ruler\" (compare Old Breton \"machtiern\", Cornish \"myghtygern\" a type of local ruler - literally \"pledge chief\") in medieval Brittany and Cornwall.\n\nHowever, the element \"*tigerno-\" was a regular one in Brittonic personal names (compare Kentigern, Catigern, Ritigern, Tigernmaglus, et al.) and, as *wortigernos (or derivatives of it) is not attested as a common noun, there is no reason to suppose that it was used as anything other than a personal name (in fact, an Old Irish cognate of it, \"Foirtchern\" was a fairly common personal name in medieval Ireland, further lending credence to the notion that Vortigern was a personal name and not a title).\n\nA valley on the north coast of the LlÅ·n Peninsula, known as Nant Gwrtheyrn or \"Vortigern's Gorge\", is named after Vortigern, and until modern times had a small barrow known locally as \"Vortigern's Grave\", along with a ruin known as \"Vortigern's Fort\". However, this conflicts with doubtful reports that he died in his castle on the River Teifi in Dyfed (\"Nennius\") or his tower at The Doward in Herefordshire (\"Geoffrey of Monmouth\").\n\nOther fortifications associated with Vortigern are at Arfon in Gwynedd, Bradford on Avon in Wiltshire, Carn Fadryn in Gwynedd, Clwyd in Powys, Llandysul in Dyfed, Old Carlisle in Cumberland, Old Sarum in Wiltshire, Rhayader in Powys, Snowdon and Stonehenge in Wiltshire.\n\nVortigern's story remained well known after the Middle Ages, especially in Great Britain. He is a major character in two Jacobean plays, the anonymous \"The Birth of Merlin\" and Thomas Middleton's \"Hengist, King of Kent\", first published in 1661. His meeting with Rowena became a popular subject in 17th-century engraving and painting, for example William Hamilton's 1793 work \"Vortigern and Rowena\". He was also featured in literature, such as John Lesslie Hall's poems about the beginnings of England.\n\nOne of Vortigern's most notorious literary appearances is in the play \"Vortigern and Rowena\", which was promoted as a lost work of William Shakespeare when it first emerged in 1796. However, it was soon revealed as a literary forgery written by the play's purported discoverer, William Henry Ireland, who had previously forged a number of other Shakespearean manuscripts. The play was at first accepted as Shakespeare's by some in the literary community, and received a performance at London's Drury Lane Theatre on 2 April 1796. The play's crude writing, however, exposed it as a forgery, and it was laughed off stage and not performed again. Ireland eventually admitted to the hoax and tried to publish the play by his own name, but had little success.\n\nVortigern often appears in modern Arthurian fiction. In the miniseries \"Merlin\" (1998) which uses the legend of Merlin and the dragons, Vortigern is played by Rutger Hauer. The movie \"The Last Legion\" (2007), based partly on the novel of the same name (2002) by Valerio Massimo Manfredi, features a very fictionalized portrayal of Vortigern under the pseudo-authentic name Vortgyn. Vortigan appears in season five of the TV series \"Once Upon a Time\" (2011), portrayed by Darren Moore. Jude Law portrays Vortigen in the film \"\" (2017), where he is Uther's younger brother, murdering him in order to usurp the throne and sacrificing his own wife and daughter to transform into a demon; he is eventually killed by his nephew Arthur.\n\n"}
