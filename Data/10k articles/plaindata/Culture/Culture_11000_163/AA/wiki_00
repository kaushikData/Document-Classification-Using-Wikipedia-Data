He attended Edinburgh High School but, unlike his brothers George and Andrew, he preferred practical pursuits to academic ones and became apprenticed to a local tanner. After his apprenticeship Combe worked as a currier in London and Glasgow, before returning to Edinburgh in 1807 to set up his own tannery business. He married Agnes Dawson in 1812 and started a family.\n\nCombe was a hard-working and successful businessman, motivated by self-interest but honourable in his dealings with others. He strongly believed that every man was responsible for his own character and was scathing in his criticism of anyone whose standards of behaviour differed from his own. Such criticisms were often expressed satirically in verse and prose.\n\nIn 1820, Combe met Robert Owen during a visit to his mill at New Lanark and was impressed by Owen's views on the formation of character, the defects in the principles and practices of society and the virtues of co-operation and universal benevolence. Following a period of reflection and study Combe radically altered his former views and habits. He ceased to be motivated by self-interest and where once he had criticised other people's weaknesses he now showed compassion. He even abandoned some of the social activities that he had previously enjoyed, such as eating meat, drinking alcohol and going to the theatre.\n\nIn 1821 Combe put his Owenism into practice by becoming a founder-member of the Edinburgh Practical Society, an Owenite group which opened its own co-operative store and founded its own school. Although the Society claimed 500 members, it fizzled out within a year. Combe then tried to set up a co-operative with his own employees at his tanyard, but this too was short-lived.\n\nCombe continued to proselytise on Owen's behalf by writing pamphlets and books. These included \"Metaphorical Sketches of the Old and New Systems\" (1823), in which he satirically attacked the prevailing capitalist economic theories by comparing the British economy to a cistern, which was capable of supplying the wants of the entire nation until the guardians of the stopcock cut off supply. He also attempted to defend Owen's religious views. Owen had scandalised large sections of society by attacking all forms of organised religion and was widely believed to be an atheist and infidel. Combe went to great lengths to present Owen's ideas as prophetic truths, wholly consistent with the laws of nature, which, he argued, were the laws of God. He referred to these beliefs as “Divine Revelation”, which he explained as “the facts and truths which the Great Governing Power of the Universe reveals to the senses and understanding”.\n\nDuring the early 1820s Owen had been trying to raise funds to set up a co-operative community in Lanarkshire, Scotland. One of his supporters was Archibald James Hamilton, whose father owned a large estate near Motherwell. On his father's behalf, Hamilton had sold part of the estate to Owen, but after much delay Owen abandoned the project and went to America to set up a community at New Harmony, Indiana. Hamilton had known Combe since the days of the Edinburgh Practical Society and together they decided to set up a community without Owen's help. They and others formed a joint-stock company to finance the operation, Hamilton bought back the land from Owen and sold a smaller part of it, at Orbiston, near Motherwell, to the company.\n\nBuilding works to house the new community commenced in March 1825, but it was several months before any tenants could be admitted. In the early days, Combe and Hamilton were assisted by George Mudie, who had founded the Owenite community at Spa Fields. Mudie and Combe, however, could not work together and Mudie soon left after warning Hamilton that Combe lacked the management skills to lead the community.\n\nAlthough building work was far from complete, the first tenants were admitted in October 1825. The community got off to a controversial start when Combe insisted that it be known as The First Society of Adherents to Divine Revelation. Many of the members objected but as Combe had been accepted as their leader his will prevailed. In order to chronicle the progress of the community he edited a weekly newspaper, \"The Register for the First Society of Adherents to Divine Revelation at Orbiston\". In spite of Combe's protestations of religious orthodoxy, the community was viewed with suspicion by local church ministers and their congregations. The situation was not helped by the unruly behaviour of the building workers, Orbiston became known locally as \"Babylon\" and some newsagents refused to stock \"The Register\". \n\nNevertheless, the community continued to grow and by the summer of 1826 it consisted of around 250 members, while its commercial activities included an iron foundry, a printing press, a dairy, a grain mill and several building trades. Orbiston was visited by several English co-operators who were keen to see its progress. One visitor was the economic writer John Gray, who published an address of advice and criticism of Combe's experiment: \"A Word of Advice to the Orbistonians, on the Principles Which Ought to Regulate their Present Proceedings\" (1826). Like George Mudie before him, Gray was alarmed by the lack of any management plan for the community. Combe had accepted all applicants for membership, without regard for what type of work they were capable of undertaking. As a result, Gray thought, the community was failing to perform the tasks necessary for its survival. While Gray was fulsome in his praise of Combe as a person he said that he was \"too little of a theorist... his mind was very prematurely devoted to practical measures.\" Other visitors made similar criticisms, but Combe was not convinced that the survival of community was at risk. \n\nCombe's health now began to fail. In addition to editing \"The Register\" and addressing numerous meetings, he had also spent many hours helping to dig trenches. By mid-1826 he was coughing up blood and having trouble breathing. His doctor in Edinburgh told him that his lungs were inflamed and that he should cease all strenuous activity. After a two-week convalescence Combe seemed to recover and he returned to Orbiston. However, in August 1826 he had another attack, which left him too weak to continue leading the community. He gave up editing \"The Register\" and left Orbiston to live in Edinburgh. Combe remained the community's President and talisman. He gave advice through letters to \"The Register\", but played no part in its day-to-day activities and was unable to resolve the various internal disputes which were dividing the community. Combe died on 11 August 1827 and by the end of that year the community had been wound up.\n\n\n"}

The excavations were carried out by Boris Gasparyan of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia and Ron Pinhasi from University College Cork (Ireland), and were sponsored by the Gfoeller Foundation (USA) and University College Cork. In 2008 the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) also joined the project with Gregory Areshian as co-director of the Areni Project. Since then the excavations have been sponsored by UCLA and the National Geographic Society as well. The excavations of the winery were completed in 2010.\n\nThe winery consists of fermentation vats, a wine press, storage jars, pottery sherds, and is believed to be at least a thousand years older than the winery unearthed in Judea and Samaria in 1963, which is the second oldest currently known.\n\nThe Areni-1 shoe was found in the same cave in 2008.\n\nExcavations at the Areni-1 site began in 2007 and continued until September 2010. Armenian, American and Irish archaeologists fully unearthed a large, well-preserved 2-foot (60 centimeter) deep vat, along with a 3.5-foot (one meter) long basin made of clay and covered with malvidin. In addition to these discoveries grape seeds, remains of pressed grapes, prunes, walnuts, and desiccated vines were found. A number of drinking cups, found next to a set of ancient graves, were also excavated, suggesting that the site was used for funeral ceremonies and ritualistic practices. The cave was abandoned after its roof caved in, and the organic material was preserved thanks to sheep dung, which prevented fungi from destroying the remains.\n\nThe team's full findings will be published in future.\n\nThe results of the biochemical analysis of the residues from the bottom of the wine-press and the storage jars carried out by Hans Barnard and his colleagues at UCLA were published in the \"Journal of Archaeological Science\" in January 2011.\n\nBotanical analysis and radiocarbon tests carried out by researchers at the University of California, Irvine and Oxford University have revealed the date of the Areni-1 winery to around 4100 BC and 4000 BC or the Late Chalcolithic Period. According to Areshian, the vintners used their feet to press the wine in the clay basin, the juice of which would then drain into the vat, where it would remain to ferment until being stored in jars. The capacity of the vat has been estimated to be about 14–15 gallons (US or imperial??) .\n\nAccording to Areshian, the discovery of the winery has provided greater insight to the study of horticulture. Patrick E. McGovern, a biomolecular archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania Museum, has likewise emphasized the importance of the discovery, describing it as \"important and unique, because it indicates large-scale wine production, which would imply, I think, that the grape had already been domesticated.\"\n\nThe exact identity of the people who lived in the region at the time is not known, although some researchers have postulated that they may have belonged to the Kura-Araxes people and added that they may have been very involved in trade.\n\n\n\n"}

The term first appeared in 1920, in the prohibition-era United States, in reference to the poor-quality alcohol that was being made.\n\nAs gin was the predominant drink in the 1920s, many variations were created by mixing cheap grain alcohol with water and flavorings and other agents, such as juniper berry juice and glycerin. Because the preferred sort of bottle was too tall to be topped off with water from a sink, they were filled from a bathtub tap. In addition, mixing grain alcohol, water and flavorings in vessels large enough to supply commercial users, had to be small enough for the operation to go undetected by the police. The common metal bathtub in use at the time would have been ideal as would have been a ceramic bathtub, hence the name, 'bathtub gin'. However, since distillation requires closed distillation apparatus and cannot be accomplished in an open vessel such as a bathtub, stories of distilled alcoholic products produced in an open bathtub are likely untrue. \n\nMany gin cocktails owe their existence to bathtub gin, as they were also created in order to mask the unpleasant taste.\n\nBathtub Gin is also the name for a gin brand produced by Ableforth's in the United Kingdom. Although not made in a bathtub, it is produced using compounding/infusing rather than using botanical distillation.\n\nThe \"Simpsons\" episode \"Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment\" features Homer and Bart mixing and brewing alcohol, including gin, in various bathtubs in the basement and secretly supplying and distributing it to Moe's Tavern via an elaborate delivery system to avoid detection.\n\nThe band Phish has a song titled \"Bathtub Gin\" that was originally released on the album \"Lawn Boy\". The song also appears on \"Hampton Comes Alive\" and several other live albums.\n\nGraham Parker has a song titled \"Bathtub Gin\" on the 2018 album Cloud Symbols.\n\nMean Miss Hannigan (Carol Burnett) in the film Annie (1982) is shown doctoring bathtub gin.\n\nThere is a bar in New York City called Bathtub Gin. It is hidden behind a cafe to refer to the secret bars of the prohibition era.\n\nThere is also a bar in Seattle, Washington called Bathtub Gin & Co, a speakeasy style bar in the heart of Belltown.\n\n"}
{"id": "4453753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4453753", "title": "Begotten (film)", "text": "Begotten (film)\n\nBegotten is a 1990 American experimental dark fantasy horror film written, produced, edited and directed by E. Elias Merhige. It narrates the story of Genesis while re-imagining it.\n\nMerhige considers \"Begotten\" the start of an unofficial trilogy. There is a prologue to the intended second installment in the trilogy, the 14-minute short \"Din of Celestial Birds\", which deals with evolution and was shot in a similar visual style as \"Begotten\".\n\nThe story opens with a robed, profusely bleeding \"God\" disemboweling itself, with the act ultimately ending in its death. A woman, Mother Earth, emerges from its remains, sexually arouses the dead body, and inseminates herself with its semen. Pregnant, she wanders off into a vast, barren landscape. The pregnancy manifests in a fully grown convulsing man whom she leaves to his own devices.\n\nThe \"Son of Earth\" meets a group of faceless nomads who seize him with what is either a very long umbilical cord or a rope. The Son of Earth vomits organic pieces that the nomads excitedly accept as gifts. The nomads finally bring the man to a fire and burn him. Mother Earth encounters the resurrected man and comforts him. She seizes him with a similar umbilical cord. The nomads appear and proceed to rape her. Son of Earth is left to mourn over the lifeless body.\n\nA group of characters appear and carry Mother Earth to another place, where they dismember her, later returning for Son of Earth. After he, too, is dismembered, the group buries the remains, planting the parts into the crust of the earth. The burial site becomes lush with flowers. Grainy photographs of God Killing Himself are shown. In a final scene, Mother Earth and Son of Earth are seen again in a flashback, wandering through a forest.\n\n\n\"Begotten\" was written, produced, and directed by Edmund Elias Merhige. Development for the film began in 1984. Merhige, who owned a small theatre production company in New York City at the time, had worked on several different experimental theatre productions up to that point and was working on developing his next project. He had originally intended for the film to be a theatre production, and later recalled: \"I originally thought of it as a dance theatre with live music piece that we would do at Lincoln Center.\" It was only after discovering that it would cost a quarter of a million dollars to produce that Merhige decided to make the script into a motion picture. Merhige, who was 20 when he wrote the script, was inspired by the theories and ideas of Antonin Artaud and Friedrich Nietzsche, which in his opinion had not been developed on film to the fullest extent. Film critic Eric D. Snider pointed out that David Lynch's \"Eraserhead\" might also have influenced the film's visual style.\nThe film incorporates religious themes and events from Christian and Slavic mythology, including Creation, Mother Earth, and various other themes on which the events in the film are loosely based.\n\nFilming took place over a period of three and a half years in several different locations, with Merhige filling multiple roles in the film's production including working on the film's cinematography, and special effects. The film was shot using a 16mm Arriflex camera on black and white reversal film. While filming, Merhige experimented with the film reel to give it an old, withered look. This included running the unshot negative through sandpaper to scratch it up before shooting. Still unsatisfied with the overall effect, Merhige decided to use an optical printer but was unable to find one within the film's budget. He then constructed one himself using old, spare parts he acquired from camera stores and special effects houses. The majority of the film was shot on a construction site on the northern end of New Jersey, at the New York border, for a period of 20 days.\n\nThe film was released on DVD in 2001 by World Artists.\n\n\"Begotten\" has received mostly positive reviews from critics.\nFilm review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 67%, based on , with a rating average of 6.3/10.\nIn 2012, \"Complex\" included the film on its list of \"50 Most Disturbing Movies\".\n\nMarc Savlov from the \"Austin Chronicle\" called the film \"Experimental, haunting, dreamlike, and intentionally confounding\". \"Merhige's stylized nightmare/dreamscape is a calculatedly misbegotten travelogue through Hell, accompanied by a jittery, muffled soundtrack of caterwauling crickets, doomed souls and worse.\"\n\"Horror News.net\" gave the film a positive review, stating, \"Begotten is hard to consume on many levels. Though in that consumption is also a smattering of brilliance\".\nJonathan Rosenbaum from the \"Chicago Reader\" praised the film calling it \"a remarkable if not extremely upsetting and gory black-and-white experimental feature\", further stating: \"If you're squeamish you should avoid this like the plague; others may find it hard to shake off the artistry and originality of this visionary effort. And if you're looking to be freaked out you shouldn't pass it up.\" Susan Sontag called it \"one of the 10 most important films of modern times\". \n\nAngelo from \"BloodyGoodHorror.com\" gave the film a positive review; stating in his review of the film, \"In a way, it inspires so much emotion on such a deep and raw level, it’s a moving and poignant film. However, the message it makes is not pretty. You will see the horrors that man is capable of in shockingly graphic detail. But if you’re like me, and wondering if you’ve been desensitized after years of horror flicks, it’ll show you whether you can still feel or not\".\nAuthor and independent filmmaker John Kenneth Muir awarded the film two and a half out of a possible four stars, calling it \"an experimental, one-of-a-kind cinematic experience\". In his review, Muir praised the film's originality and powerful imagery, while criticizing the running time as being too long.\n\nThe film was banned in Singapore due to its graphic and disturbing content.\n\nDin of Celestial Birds is a 2006 American experimental short film written, produced and directed by E. Elias Merhige on an estimated budget of $15,000 in cooperation with the Q6 production group, a collective of philosophers and artists. The film begins with the phrase \"hello and welcome ... do not be afraid ... be comforted ... remember ... our origin...\" and proceeds to depict the first violent formation of matter from nothingness. Then, after a hyper-accelerated trip through the evolution of life and the earth, the film culminates in the birth of an embryonic pseudo-humanoid called the Son of Light (Stephen Charles Barry) that reaches to some unknown source. It was distributed by Turner Classic Movies.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1378485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1378485", "title": "Drum circle", "text": "Drum circle\n\nA drum circle is any group of people playing (usually) hand-drums and percussion in a circle. They are distinct from a drumming group or troupe in that the drum circle is an end in itself rather than preparation for a performance. They can range in size from a handful of players to circles with thousands of participants.\nDrum circles are related to other community-based music gatherings such as flute circles or vocal improvisation groups. Largely, drum circles originated in Native and Indigenous communities. \n\nIn 1991, during testimony before the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging, Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart stated:\nTypically, people gather to drum in drum \"circles\" with others from the surrounding community. The drum circle offers equality because there is no\nhead or tail. It includes people of all ages. The main objective is to share rhythm and get in tune with each other and themselves. To form a group consciousness. To entrain and resonate. By entrainment, I mean that a new voice, a collective voice, emerges from the group as they drum together.\n\nThe term \"Drum Circle\" originated in the United States during the late 1960s and early 1970s for any group of people, particularly counterculture groups, who gather (informally) to play music together. The terms \"drum jam\" or \"jam session\" could be substituted. Settings include beaches, parks, concert parking lots, festivals, and retreats. The determining criteria for a drum circle is that the music is improvised and co-created by the participants. Drum circles may or may not be open to the public, but the music is always a group expression, not constrained by genre, instrumentation, or directed by one person or sub-group.\n\nIn Western countries, drum circles have developed into two main types: \n\nCommunity – free-form drumming, often open to the public and entirely improvised in-the-moment.\nFacilitated or Conducted – group drumming that is musically directed by a specific person, often called a facilitator or conductor .\n\nAll forms of drum circles are used in a variety of settings and applications including; team building, recreational music making, wellness, education, celebrations, spirituality, personal growth, etc.\n\nCommunity drum circles are informal gatherings of people who meet for the purpose of playing drums together. They often take place in public settings such as parks or at the beach, but may also be organized via a community center or similar body. Instrumentation centers around drums and percussion, but may include other instruments, such as flutes, didgeridoos, and other non-percussion instruments. Practically anything that can be banged on to make noise can be used as a percussion instrument such as cans, buckets, pipes, etc. One need not possess or purchase a drum to participate. Community drum circles differ from facilitated or conducted drum circles in that the music is entirely improvised through a process of group interaction. There may be a facilitator or moderator who acts to shape the experience through discrete actions, such as helping to maintain a steady beat, helping those who need it, and generally managing the environment to see that everyone is able to participate fully. The participants make up the music as they go along, using their listening and playing skills to make musical connections and express themselves in any and all ways that feel right. Participation is voluntary and often includes drumming, singing or chanting, dancing, and listening. Community drum circles often attract both regular and drop-in participants of all ages and can take place just about anywhere. Community drum circles are the original and most popular form of improvised community drumming.\n\nA \"facilitated\" drum circle is a form of group drumming in which a person seeks to focus the intent and improve the quality and effect of the activity, making it easier for people to effectively participate by taking a more directive approach. The facilitator (leader) takes responsibility for the physical space, arranging chairs and instruments to optimise communication and connection in the group. He or she may provide a range of instruments to create a full and balanced percussion orchestra. In this way, the experience can be thought of as a \"standardized drumming circle,\" as opposed to the more free-flowing and open community drum circle. The facilitator is constantly monitoring the music in the group, and generally being encouraging and accepting of participant ideas. In this way, the facilitator takes on a role similar to that of a music teacher or drumming instructor whose goal it is to empower the participants and encourage them to share their ideas. At the beginning the facilitator directs the music through verbal and non-verbal cuing. Cues, which often mirror the movements of an orchestral conductor, are directed at the participants, who respond to the leader. This creates a leader/follower dynamic between the facilitator and participants. Actions such as rolling (rumbling), starting, stopping, raising/lowering the volume, accents, and when to play/not play are often given by the facilitator. Conducting is not normally part of a traditional (community) drum circle, and therefore makes this type of circle a unique experience and very different from a community circle. Facilitators with training and experience in other areas and professions, such as music education, music therapy, and corporate training, may use a range of tools and approaches that enable them to work with diverse populations. These types of experiences are more accurately referred to as 'drumming programs,' rather than drum circles, in the traditional sense.\n\nOther forms of drumming that are related to drum circles include:\n\nIs an inclusive way of life that is focused on creating a positive enhancement of self of identity while enforcing a no harm to the collective group attitude. Neotribalism belief system is evident in the music of Neotribalism; the postmodern drum circle where the only leader is the preservation of the groove or music consciousness this development of musical consciousness takes the participation of individual to create a collective more powerful and beautiful display of sight and sound. \"In beat life begins and it is only the maintenance and sacred keeping of the beat that life will endure\".\n\nNeopagans have created another type of drum circle. At Neopagan festivals, people gather around a large bonfire, the drummers generally sitting on one side to encourage better listening. The musicians sit together and play while dancers dance and circle around the fire. Often, those present will stay and play throughout the night until dawn, treating the evening as a magical (or alchemical) working. Sound is not limited to drumming alone; there is also chanting, singing, poetry, and spoken word pieces. This type of drum circle is not usually facilitated.\n\nThis type of circle tends to center around Native American Cultural Drums and rattles but is primarily focusing on the spiritual rather than the musical aspects of the culture. They are a facilitated circle (This statement is questionable) but the leader is facilitating a shamanic journey type process rather than a musical event. Shamanic drumming is generally simple and repetitive, often considered as a form of prayer or method of trance induction, rather than as music or entertainment. During a shamanic trance or shamanic journey, the shaman uses the steady beat of the drum as a \"lifeline\" to find the way back to the world of ordinary consciousness. Note that in these cultures, the term \"Drum Circle\" would certainly not be used. Rather, the terms 'drumming ceremony\" or \"ceremonial drumming\" would be more accurate.\n\nPracticed by various groups, and outlined step by step in the book, \"Finding Sanctuary in Nature: Simple Ceremonies in the Native American Tradition for Healing Yourself and Others,\" by Jim PathFinder Ewing (Findhorn Press, Scotland, 2007), (page 147), \"the medicine wheel drum circle prayer ceremony\" recognizes the four directions—east, south, west, north—as spiritual Powers that can help balance and heal. The ceremony has four rounds, with drumming by all participants at the instruction of the leader allowing the energy of each direction in each round to come into the circle to facilitate prayers and healing. It has been described as \"like a sweat lodge without the sweat\" (page 148, Finding Sanctuary). Ewing held these ceremonies each month for seven years, as outlined in the book, in addition to shamanic drum circles, and at various sites from coast to coast in the United States since the late 1990s. Groups based on his example and the instructions outlined in the book have resulted in other groups forming worldwide. Note: This description is not of a drum circle, in the sense that the term is commonly used. It is a drumming ceremony that takes place in a circle, but very different in content and form than a drum circle (improvised community drumming jam). This type should probably be listed under shamanic or spiritual drumming and not under drum circles.\n\nCommercial drum circle groups and companies exist in most countries to serve various markets. There is also a growing body of people working in places such as hospitals, prisons, and hospices using drumming as a form of recreational and supportive music making. Music therapists often use various forms of group drumming (including improvised drumming) in their work to reach therapeutic goals and objectives. \nUSA\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term used in literature to refer to a body of work composed of episodes or similar installments is serial. Serials are also known as episodic fiction. \n\nMultiple episodes are usually grouped together into a series through a unifying story arc.

Among others, Max Weber and Ernst Troeltsch were members of the \"Heidelberg Eranos\". \n\nThe name is derived from the Ancient Greek word ἔρανος meaning \"a banquet to which the guests bring contributions of food, a no-host dinner.\" The circle at Moscia was founded by Olga Froebe-Kapteyn in 1933, and these conferences have been held annually on the grounds of her estate (on the shores of Lago Maggiore near Ascona in Switzerland) ever since. For over seventy years this event has served as a point of contact for thinkers from disparate fields of knowledge ranging from depth psychology and comparative religion to history, literary criticism and folklore, and provides a setting and a congenial group within which to discuss all things spiritual. Each conference takes place over eight days, during which time all participants eat, sleep and live together, thereby promoting a camaraderie which fosters an atmosphere of free and open discussion. Each year a new theme is addressed, and each participant scholar delivers a two-hour lecture on a topic of his choice relating to the theme — his/her contribution to the ‘banquet’ of ideas — thereby attempting to draw these multifarious thinkers into productive intellectual discourse.\n\nFroebe-Kapteyn established this group at the suggestion of the eminent German religious historian, Rudolf Otto. Froebe-Kapteyn was the Dutch foundress of the literary salon \"Table Ronde\" (\"Round Table\"), which is indicative of the Eranos’ ‘spiritualist’ bent. Indeed Eranos was from its very outset interested in these issues and its first theme, ‘Yoga and Meditation in East and West’, was a truly pioneering subject in the early 1930s. Past themes include Ancient Sun Cults and the Symbolism of Light in the Gnosis and in Early Christianity (1943), Man and Peace (1958), Creation and Organization (1966) and The Truth of Dreams (1995). Participants over the years have included Heinrich Zimmer (Indian religious art), Karl Kerényi (Greek mythology), Mircea Eliade (history of religions), Carl Gustav Jung and Erich Neumann (analytical psychology), Alfons Rosenberg (symbolism), Gilles Quispel (gnostic studies), Gershom Scholem (Jewish mysticism), Henry Corbin (Islamic religion), Adolf Portmann (biology), Herbert Read (art history), Max Knoll (physics), and Joseph Campbell (comparative mythology). The Eranos conferences have resulted in the publication of a number of books. Anyone may attend the lectures upon payment of a small fee.\n\nSee also: \"Selected Bibliography\", http://www.eranos.org/content/html/start_english.html\n\n"}

From there its range was extended to Venezuela and the east coast of Brazil. Common names include fique, cabuya, pita, penca, penco, maguey, cabui, chuchao and coquiza.\n\nThe fique plant is often confused with the agave plant. The differences are that the agave leaves are stiff, with a strong spine at the tip, while the Fique plant leaves are droopy and lack a spine.\n\nThe pre-Columbian inhabitants extracted and used the fique fibs for several centuries before the arrival of Spanish conquerors to make garments, ropes, hammocks and many other applications.\n\nIn the 17th century, Dutch colonists carried the plant from their Brazilian colonies in Pernambuco to the island of Mauritius. The native inhabitants of the island learned to use the fibre and called it “caraguatá-acú” “croatá-acu” or “gravata”-acú”.\n\nThe fibre was also introduced to St. Helena, India, Sri Lanka, Algeria, Madagascar, East Africa, Mexico and Costa Rica.\n\nIn the 18th century, in Dagua, Valle del Cauca, Colombia, the priest Feliciano Villalobos started the first rope and wrapping materials manufacturing industry; his products were made of fique. In 1880 the Colombian government reported a yearly production of three million kilograms of fibres, the exportation to Venezuela of two million, the fabrication of five millions pairs of alpargatas and four million metres of rope.\n\nBetween 1970 and 1975 the fique industry suffered a crisis brought about by the development of polypropylene, which costs less and is produced faster.\n\nToday, fique is considered the Colombian national fibre and is used in the fabrication of ethnic products, Colombian handicrafts and recently (since July 2007) has been used for the heat protectors (handmade in Barichara) placed around the Colombian coffee cups sold in the Juan Valdez coffee shops worldwide.\n\n\n\nThe fique can be obtained from several species of \"Furcraea\", such as \"F. macrophylla\" Baker, cabuya Trel, andina Trel, and castilla. Depending of the process of the fiber and the species used, many varieties of fique fibers can be obtained. Among others:\n\n\n\nOptimal conditions for the growing of the fique plant are:\n\n\nFique crops bring nitrogen to the soil, improving its fertility. The plant is very adaptable to different ecological conditions. A fique plant can produce 1 to 6 kg of fiber each year.\n\n"}
{"id": "24025135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24025135", "title": "Game pie", "text": "Game pie\n\nGame pie is a form of meat pie featuring game. The dish dates from Roman times when the main ingredients were wild birds and animals such as partridge, pheasant, deer, and hare. The pies reached their most elaborate form in Victorian England, with complex recipes and specialized moulds and serving dishes. Modern versions are simpler but savoury combinations of rabbit, venison, pigeon, pheasant, and other commercially available game.\n\nGame pies were consumed by the wealthy in the days of the Roman Empire. Wilhelm Adolf Becker states that the emperor Augustus consumed pies that contained chicken, pheasants, pigeon, and duck.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, \"bake mete\" described a pie in which meat or fish is baked with fruit, spices, etc. The meats and sauces were placed in a tough and inedible pastry shell, or \"coffin\" with a lid sealed on, then baked. There was no pan: the pie shell itself acted as the container. Frequently the pastry was considered superfluous and was discarded. The process of raising the sides of the pie to form a strong protective crust is described in old cookery books as \"raising the coffin\".\nThe term \"mete\" referred to the pie, not the meat: a 15th-century cookbook gives a bake mete recipe for a pear custard pie.\n\nDescribing the franklin in the 14th-century classic \"The Canterbury Tales\", Chaucer said: \"Withoute bake mete was nevere his hous, Of fissh and flessh, and that so plentvous\". The best meat might be reserved for the wealthy, while their servants ate inferior pies made of the left-over \"umbles\" – liver, heart, tripes, and other offal, hence the term \"eating humble pie\".\n\nIn medieval times, birds that might be found in a game pie included heron, crane, crow, swan, stork, cormorant, and bittern as well as smaller birds trapped by nets such as thrushes, starlings, and blackbirds. The 15th-century cookery book \"Un Vyaunde furnez sanz nom de chare\" describes a croustade of veal, herbs, dates, and eggs baked in a coffin, but other sources describe croustades of chicken and pigeon. Birds were often placed on top of game pies as ornaments, or 'subtelties', a practice that continued into the Victorian age. An 1890s edition of \"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management\" shows a game pie topped by a stuffed pheasant.\n\nThrough most of the period of the Tudor and Stuart monarchs, roughly from 1500 to 1685, it was common for the rulers and their courtiers to stage elaborate feasts where the attraction was as much the entertainment provided by musicians, comedians, jugglers and acrobats as the food itself. Sometimes the two were combined. Around 1630, at a dinner attended by Charles I, a huge game pie was placed on the table. But when the crust was removed, a dwarf armed with sword and buckler sprang from the coffin. On another occasion, the king was served a surprise pie containing live birds, perhaps the origin of the rhyme \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\".\n\nThe game pies of that period were sweeter than in later times, often containing fruit as well as meat, game and spices.\nThe Tudor Christmas Pie was a rich pie of traditional birds such as partridge, chicken and goose with a recent addition, the turkey, which had been introduced to England from the New World in 1523.\nGame pie was not restricted to the rich.\nUntil the 1816 Gaming act, country people had the right to catch small game such as rabbits and pigeons to supplement their diet.\nMore valuable game were reserved for the rich, but perhaps not entirely successfully. Shakespeare in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" alludes to a Venison pasty made from \"ill-killed\" deer.\n\nIn 1653 François Pierre La Varenne published his groundbreaking work \"Le Pâtissier françois\". On the frontispiece is a country kitchen where the cook is making a game pie surrounded by the dead game that would have been included. The \"Oreiller de la Belle Aurore\" is an elaborate game pie named after Claudine-Aurore Récamier, the mother of Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin. The large square pie, which was one of her son's favorite dishes, contains a variety of game birds and their livers, veal, pork, truffles, aspic, and much else, in puff pastry. It is described in the classic encyclopedia of gastronomy, the Larousse Gastronomique.\n\nIn the 18th century, game pies prepared for the prosperous gentry could be very elaborate. Hannah Glasse, in her best-selling \"The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy\", first published in 1747, gave a recipe for a Christmas pie that included pigeon, partridge, a chicken and a goose, all boned and placed one inside the other, and then placed within an enormous turkey. In his 1816 autobiography William Hutton recalls of his maternal grandmother:\n\nShe was a careful yet liberal housekeeper, and well skilled in cookery, pastry, and confectionery. I have heard of a pie she raised in the form of a goose trussed for the spit; the real goose was boned; a duck was boned and laid within it; a fowl was boned and laid within the duck; a boned partridge within the fowl; and a boned pigeon within the partridge. The whole having been properly seasoned, the interstices were filled with rich gravy.\n\nBenjamin Disraeli in his novel \"Venetia\" describes an English dinner around 1770 that included ...that masterpiece of the culinary art, a great battalia pie, in which the bodies of chickens, pigeons, and rabbits, were embalmed in spices, cock's combs, and savoury balls, and well bedewed with one of those rich sauces of claret, anchovy, and sweet herbs ... [on] the cover of this pastry ... the curious cook had contrived to represent all the once-living forms that were now entombed in that gorgeous sepulchre.\n\nAt some point, it became customary for game pies to be served cold. An enormous game pie was made for the Earl of Sefton in the first part of the 19th century to be presented to the corporation of Liverpool. It contained a great variety of game, stuffed one bird within another, as well as truffles, veal, bacon and other ingredients. The meats were first cooked, then cooled with ice and placed in a huge pastry shell with a crust, which was further cooked for three hours. After pouring a hot aspic sauce into the pie through a funnel, it was allowed to cool again for two days before being served cold. The 1845 cookbook \"The practical cook, English and foreign\" describes similar game pies of chickens, pigeons, partridges, hares, rabbits, pheasants, gray plovers, grouse, wild fowls or small birds, which may have slices of ham added. With all of these, calf's foot jelly or the bone of a knuckle of veal stewed down to a jelly was added to form aspic when the pie was cooled. The cold pie would then be sliced and served in the same way as its relative, the modern pork pie.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, potters such as Josiah Wedgwood introduced industrial processes that made it practical to mass-produce glazed pottery containers capable of withstanding the heat of the oven, at relatively low prices. Following a suggestion by Richard Lovell Edgeworth in 1786, Wedgwood started making game pie dishes with an inner liner to hold the contents and an ornamental cover. These were a useful alternative to the traditional pastry coffin, since there were endemic shortages of wheat at this time caused by the early industrial revolution coupled with the disruption of trade during the Napoleonic wars\nWedgwood's dishes often had raised bas-relief ornaments of dead game and vine leaves, and a lid handle often modeled on a hare or root vegetable. Some designs gave the illusion of a pastry coffin and lid. William Jesse in his 1844 biography of Beau Brummel says this design was introduced in 1800 when the royal household prohibited the use of flour for pastry in their kitchens, using rice instead.\n\nThe invention of the sprung metal pie form made it possible to use a finer pastry than the old-fashioned hot water crust pastry, and also to impart much finer decorative detail to the surface of the pastry. The moulds were sold in many different designs. The potter Herbert Minton introduced Majolica wares in 1851, earthenware ceramics decorated with relief figures and brilliant glazes. Until not long before, only the aristocracy and the gentry had had the right to consume game and there were still many restrictions. Expensive Majolica game pie dishes, draped with images of sumptuous game animals, were used by aspiring middle-class families to signal that they had the wealth or connections to obtain the game that they served to their guests legally rather than through the black market.\n\nAs the Victorian age advanced, the middle classes grew rapidly, with aspirations to a lifestyle that had been reserved to the privileged few. Pioneers such as Alexis Soyer introduced new cooking techniques for the masses based on scientific principles and gas ovens.\nMrs. Beeton addressed a broad audience in her 1861 \"Book of Household Management\", giving simple recipes for grouse and partridge pie and for preparing other common game such as wild duck, hare, corn-crake, pheasant, plovers, ptarmigan, quail, venison, etc.\n\nThe game pie gradually waned in snob appeal and popularity. In \"The Mating Season\", P.G. Wodehouse notes that Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright once hit the game pie at the Drones six times with six consecutive bread rolls from a seat at the far window.\nIn \"Vile Bodies\", a novel about the period between the first and second world wars, Evelyn Waugh describes the game pie at Shepheard's, a fictional club, as \"quite black inside and full of beaks and shot and inexplicable vertebrae\".\n\nMany restaurants today serve game pies and there are many modern recipes, but they are usually quite different from the traditional cold game pie. Commonly they contain a savoury stew of commercially available meats such as rabbit and venison, quail and pheasant, but not birds such as pigeons, thrushes, starlings, blackbirds, and crows that were commonly used in the past. They are usually served hot, and may have no shell but only a pastry cover – or in restaurants only a puff-pastry lid added at the last minute.\n\n\n"}

It is part of an elaborate series of celebrations constituting the Bengali wedding. It originates from the Hindu wedding religious ceremony where Lord Shiva and his bride Sati were applied with Haldi to cool the couple and make them look even more beautiful. Later adopted in the Indian subcontinent as a wedding ritual and celebration by different communities (often called Haldi in the western Hindu communities), it continued in different religions down generations. The gaye holud takes place one or two days prior to the religious and legal Bengali wedding ceremonies. The gaye holud may be a joint event for the bride and groom's families, or it may consist of separate events for the bride's family and the groom's family. \n\nSeparate events are held for the bride's gaye holud, the groom's family - minus the groom himself - go in procession to the bride's home. They carry with them the bride's wedding outfit and jewelry, wedding decorations such as the turmeric paste ( \"holud\") and henna ( \"mehedi\"/\"mendi\"), cosmetics, sweets and other gifts. They may also bring fresh fish dressed as a wedding couple, or desserts molded to resemble fish. The procession traditionally centers on the bride's (younger) female relatives and friends, who traditionally dress in matching clothes. The bride, her attendees, and all the guests traditionally wear red, yellow, orange, or green clothing. Nowadays, other colours may be permitted for gaye holud guests. The guests then enjoy a feast, including music, dance and some performances, arranged by the bride's family.\n\nThe bride is seated on a dais, and the henna is used to decorate her hands and feet with elaborate abstract designs. The turmeric paste is applied by the guests to her face and body. Turmeric is known to cleanse, soften and brighten the skin, giving the bride's skin the distinctive yellow hue that gives its name to this ceremony. The sweets are then fed to the bride by all the guests and attendants, piece by piece.\n\nThe groom's gaye holud comes next, and has the same form as the bride's holud ceremony. In this ceremony, the bride does not participate. The groom is accompanied by his younger male relatives and friends, and as with the bride's ceremony, the guests traditionally wear red, yellow, green, or orange clothing. The bride's family brings the gifts for the groom (usually the wedding outfit and some grooming items, along with the turmeric and other gifts) to his house. The guests exchange sweets with and apply turmeric paste to the groom, and a feast (with food, music, dance, and various cultural performances) is arranged for the guests from the groom's family. Unlike the bride, the groom does not get henna applied to his body; henna is only applied to the bride and perhaps also some of her younger female attendants.\n\nAlthough similar ceremonies exist in other parts of the Indian subcontinent, the gaye holud is a custom particular to the Bengali people. It is not considered a religious function, as it is celebrated by Muslims, Hindus, and Christians in both Bangladesh and Indian West Bengal. Although it is considered a part of the Bengali wedding tradition, the couple is not considered married at the end of the gaye holud. There is no legal marriage performed during this ceremony. Unlike the wedding ceremonies, the gaye holud is not a formal or extravagant event; both guests and bridal party members dress more simply and decorate the venue less intricately than at the wedding ceremonies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1025688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1025688", "title": "Hellmouth", "text": "Hellmouth\n\nHellmouth is the entrance to Hell envisaged as the gaping mouth of a huge monster, an image which first appears in Anglo-Saxon art, and then spread all over Europe, remaining very common in depictions of the \"Last Judgment\" and \"Harrowing of Hell\" until the end of the Middle Ages, and still sometimes used during the Renaissance and after. It enjoyed something of a revival in polemical popular prints after the Protestant Reformation, when figures from the opposite side would be shown disappearing into the mouth. A notable late appearance is in the two versions of a painting by El Greco of about 1578. Political cartoons still showed Napoleon leading his troops into one.\n\nMedieval theatre often had a hellmouth prop or mechanical device which was used to attempt to scare the audience by vividly dramatizing an entrance to Hell. These seem often to have featured a battlemented castle entrance, in painting usually associated with Heaven.\n\nThe oldest example of an animal Hellmouth known to Meyer Schapiro was an ivory carving of c. 800 in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and he says most examples before the 12th century are English. Many show the Harrowing of Hell, which appealed to Anglo-Saxon taste, as a successful military raid by Christ. Schapiro speculates that the image may have drawn from the pagan myth of the Crack of Doom, with the mouth that of the wolf-monster Fenrir, slain by Vidar, who is used as a symbol of Christ on the Gosforth Cross and other pieces of Anglo-Scandinavian art. In the assimilation of Christianised Viking populations in northern England, the Church was surprisingly ready to allow the association of pagan mythological images with Christian ones, in hogback grave markers for example.\n\nIn the Anglo-Saxon Vercelli Homilies (4:46-8) Satan is likened to a dragon swallowing the damned:\n\n\"... ne cumaþ þa næfre of þæra wyrma seaðe & of þæs dracan ceolan\nþe is Satan nemned.\" - \"[they] never come out of the pit of snakes and of the throat of the dragon which is called Satan.\"\n\nThe whale-monster Leviathan (translated from Hebrew, Job 41:1, \"wreathed animal\") has been equated with this description, although this is hard to confirm in the earliest appearances. However, in \"The Whale\", an Old English poem from the Exeter Book, the mouth of Hell is compared to a whale's mouth: \nThe whale has another trick: when he is hungry, he opens his mouth and a sweet smell comes out. The fish are tricked by the smell and they enter into his mouth. Suddenly the whale’s jaws close.\n\nLikewise, any man who lets himself be tricked by a sweet smell and led to sin will go into hell, opened by the devil — if he has followed the pleasures of the body and not those of the spirit. When the devil has brought them to hell, he clashes together the jaws, the gates of hell. No one can get out from them, just as no fish can escape from the mouth of the whale. \n\nLater in the Middle Ages the classical Cerberus also became associated with the image, although it is hardly likely that the Anglo-Saxons had him in mind.\n\nSatan himself is often shown sitting in Hell eating the damned, but according to G.D. Schmidt this is a separate image, and the Hellmouth should not be considered to be the mouth of Satan, although Hofmann is inclined to disagree with this. The Hellmouth never bites the damned, remaining wide open, ready for more.\n\nIn late medieval works by Hieronymous Bosch and his followers, where the wide interior of Hell is shown, there is often a Hellmouth leading to some special compartment.\n\n"}

The device arrives in kit form as an intelligence test for scientists who might prove helpful to an alien race.\n\nAn interocitor is an alien device with unusual and strange properties. The concept was invented by science fiction writer Raymond F. Jones, who wrote the original novel \"This Island Earth\" beginning as a series of three sci-fi short stories now known as \"The Peace Engineers Trilogy\" appearing in the sci-fi pulp magazine \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\" from 1949 to 1951. Raymond F. Jones then did a novelization of the complete story into full book form and it was first published in 1952 by Shasta Press. Universal Studios purchased the screen rights to the novel in 1953, since the novel was a popular sci-fi best seller, and made it into a Technicolor film in 1954, which was then released on June 1, 1955. The film was a modest success and has somewhat impressive visual effects. The first third of the trilogy of stories was titled \"The Alien Machine,\" referring to the Interocitor, with original graphic artwork penned by sci-fi artist Virgil Finlay. The story was sold to the press with the help of literary agent Forrest J. Ackerman.\n\nThe term \"interocitor\" itself, rather than referring to a specific device, likely refers to a general class of devices that share a common set of operating principles (similar to the term \"computer\"). This is inferred from the fact an interocitor is observed or described in many different roles:\n\nIn the film, advanced physicist Cal Meacham first becomes aware of an interocitor when a book arrives at his lab titled \"Electronic Service, Unit #16\". Inside is contained a bill of materials for the interocitor, describing it as, \"incorporating greater advances than hitherto known in the field of electronics.\" From the specifications, Meacham opines, \"There's no limit to what it could do. Laying a four-lane highway at the rate of a mile a minute would be a cinch.\"\n\nOf the 2486 components making up an interocitor, only three are mentioned by name in the film:\n\nThe instructions accompanying the components also caution that no interocitor part can be replaced, and to bear this in mind while assembling.\n\nOnce assembled and powered, Meacham places the intensifier disk into the right-hand control and rotates it 18 degrees counter-clockwise. Upon doing so, the telecommunication function of the interocitor is activated, and Meacham establishes contact with Exeter, the party responsible for sending him the components for the device.\n\nDuring their conversation, Meacham's lab assistant, Joe Wilson, attempts to photograph the device but is informed by Exeter that, \"Your camera will pick up nothing but black fog. Images on the interocitor don't register on film.\" Exeter then destroys all evidence of the machine and its blueprints using its functionality as a guided energy weapon Meacham tries to pull the power cord just as Exeter initiates the process, but the interocitor self-destructs, leaving nothing but a pile of debris.\n\nMeacham later boards a Douglas DC-3 autopiloted by an interocitor to join Exeter at his research facility. Exeter is also seen using an interocitor to remotely observe a private conversation between Meacham and two other scientists at the facility, Ruth Adams and Steve Carlson. Exeter's assistant, Brack, later uses the weapons capability of the device to thwart the attempted escape of Meacham, Adams, and Carlson from the facility.\n\n\n"}

The core of the group was formed by Luria, Lebedinsky and Leontiev and their Moscow colleagues, Zaporozhets and Bozhovich, along with a group of such local researchers as Gal'perin, Asnin, P. Zinchenko, Lukov, Khomenko, Kontsevaya, Rozenblyum, etc. The group conducted a wide range of psychological studies on concept formation in children, voluntary and involuntary memory, development of visual-operational thinking, voluntary behaviour, and reasoning, the role of orientation in thought and activity, etc. that laid the foundation for the psychological theory of activity.\n\nIn the postwar period, the scientific work of the school developed under informal leadership of Pyotr Zinchenko in the field of the psychology of memory. The major achievement of the school is the systematic analysis of the phenomenon of involuntary memory from the standpoint of the activity approach in psychology. Soviet studies of involuntary memory carried out by the representatives of the Kharkiv school influenced psychological research both nationally and worldwide (e.g., memory research by A. Brown, Murphy, Meacham, Sophian, Hagen, etc.).\n\nThe information processing or engineering psychology approach to memory and cognition was developed in the research by Zinchenko, Bocharova, Nevel'skii, Repkina. On the other hand, research on the role of involuntary memory in education and memory in thinking and personality development was conducted by Sereda, Ivanova, and associates.\n\nAnother major area of research is the theory and practice of developmental teaching (or the system of El'konin-Davydov) associated with such representatives of the Kharkiv school as Repkin, Bodanskii, Dusavitskii.\n\nSpecial journal issues\nSelected papers In English\n\n\n\n"}

Basque was different enough that it could not be taken as a debased form of Spanish but was despised as a rural language of limited currency, unfit for modern discourse. This never happened at the academic level, though.\n\nAll these policies became less strict and more permissive as time passed.\n\nThe Press Law of Manuel Fraga Iribarne replaced the pre-publication censorship with after-the-fact punishments.\n\nMost notably, several sporting organizations -- including FC Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao, among others -- were forced to change their names from the local language to Spanish. In fact, Atlético Madrid, itself with roots in Athletic Bilbao, received its current name as a result of Franco's language policies, in 1941. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCA Osasuna was allowed to maintain its Basque name, unlike other football teams with non-Spanish names.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The child might be said to be \"marked\" as a result.\n\nMaternal impression, according to a long-discredited medical theory, was a phenomenon that explained the existence of birth defects and congenital disorders. The theory stated that an emotional stimulus experienced by a pregnant woman could influence the development of the fetus. For example, it was sometimes supposed that the mother of the Elephant Man was frightened by an elephant during her pregnancy, thus \"imprinting\" the memory of the elephant onto the gestating fetus. Mental problems, such as schizophrenia and depression, were believed to be a manifestation of similar disordered feelings in the mother. For instance, a pregnant woman who experienced great sadness might imprint depressive tendencies onto the fetus in her womb.\n\nThe theory of maternal impression was largely abandoned by the 20th century, with the development of modern genetic theory.\n\nIn folklore, maternal imprinting, or Versehen (a German noun meaning \"inadvertance\" or as a verb \"to provide\") as it is usually called, is the belief that a sudden fear of some object or animal in a pregnant woman can cause her child to bear the mark of it.\n\nOswald Spengler understood maternal imprinting to be a folkloric understanding of what he called \"blood feeling\" or the formation of a group aesthetic of a bodily ideal:\nWhat is called the \"Versehen\" of a pregnant woman is only a particular and not very important instance of the workings of a very deep and powerful formative principle inherent in all that is of the race side. It is a matter of common observation that elderly married people become strangely like one another, although probably Science with its measuring instruments would \"prove\" the exact opposite. It is impossible to exaggerate the formative power of this living pulse, this strong inward feeling for the perfection of one's own type. The feeling for race-beauty—so opposite to the conscious taste of ripe urbans for intellectual-individual traits of beauty—is immensely strong in primitive men, and for that very reason never emerges into their consciousness. But such a feeling is race-forming. It undoubtedly molded the warrior- and hero-type of a nomad tribe more and definitely on \"one bodily ideal\", so that it would have been quite unambiguous to speak of the race-figure of Romans or Ostrogoths.\n\nPliny the Elder also comments at length about the phenomenon of \"postpartum\" maternal impression in bears, i.e., the folk belief that newborn bears must be licked and molded into bear-shape by their mothers.\n\n\n"}

It was designed to be the bridge between a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, allowing employees to continue advancing their education without affecting their employment and personal commitments. \n\nFirst launched in September 2016 with 19 MicroMasters programs as an extension of its MOOC, edX eventually expanded to include 17 additional programs in February 2017. As of November 2018, 51 different MicroMasters programs are being offered, with 47 in English, 3 in Spanish, and 1 in French. Each MicroMasters program is sponsored by at least one industry partner, including GE, Microsoft, IBM, Hootsuite, Fidelity, Bloomberg, Walmart, PWC, Booz-Allen Hamilton, and Ford. These programs are designed to bridge the gap between job candidates with a bachelor's degree and companies that want employees with an advanced degree by offering credentials that are equivalent to 25 to 50 percent of a master's degree or 20 to 30 ECTS in Europe.\n\nUnlike other existing microcredentials, the MicroMasters programs offer both the benefit of gaining relevant skills in a particular field that can support career development and a pathway to advanced credits in the respective universities offering the course. This includes many of the top universities in the world such as MIT, Columbia University, Delft University of Technology, and Indian Institute of Management. The idea of the MicroMasters program started out as an iteration of the existing MOOC model when Coursera first started offering specializations for its various disciplines and a response to the changing nature of work as well as the major skills shortage currently impacting businesses around the world.\n\nAll MicroMasters programs are currently running on the edX MOOC platform, where learners are free to audit any of the courses. Depending on the program, there are prerequisites ranging from graduate level understanding of various specific disciplines or work experienced. However, these prerequisites serve as recommended guidelines for the learners rather than a strictly enforced rule so there are no specific degree requirements for any of the courses. However, learners will have to pay if they wish to pursue a verified certificate.\n\nTo qualify for a certificate for successfully completing a MicroMasters Program, all learners are required to complete a series of interactive courses as specified in the respective MicroMasters program and achieve a minimum grade according to the institution awarding the certification. \n\nFor learners interested in developing skills for professional advancement, the certificate for completing a MicroMasters Program may be sufficient.\n\nFor learners interested in academic credit, the learner must be admitted into the university's respective master's program. Some programs, such as the MicroMasters Program in Supply Chain Management by MIT also operate on a blended learning model which include a timed examination as well as a final proctored examination. Admission requirements for its on-campus blended learning program differ from its traditional residential admission requirements as applicants are not required to submit scores in a GRE or GMAT as performance in the Micromasters program will be taken as a substitute for it. Some other programs still follow usual admission guidelines and the MicroMasters program has little to no impact on their application apart from receiving advanced credits upon admission into its respective programs. Generally, most courses include practice exercises which are ungraded as well as graded assignments with limited attempts.\n\nThe following is a list of the current MicroMasters programs offered as well as the respective graduate degree options available for each program upon graduation of the MicroMasters program.\n!MicroMasters Program Name\n!Institution\n!Institutions Offering Credit for Advanced Standing\n!Subsequent Degree Options with Advanced Standing\n\nGeorgia Institute launched its online master's in computer science to emulate its residential program as much as possible. Later, in 2017, with edX it also started a MicroMasters program for analytics, which would allow advanced credits for its online master's in analytics (for admitted learners) and also support learners interested in the subject matter and for whom the MicroMasters program certificate met career needs.\n\nedX applied for a trademark for \"MicroMasters\" in response to Udacity registering \"nanodegree\" as its trademark in 2014. The Rocheter Institute of Technology launched its MicroMasters in project management, allowing learners to use it to fulfil the prerequisite of project management education for the PMP certification.\n\nGeneral Electric has promised to interview any Massachusetts resident who completed a MicroMasters program in supply chain management, cybersecurity, cloud computing, or artificial intelligence.\n\nMIT admitted its first batch of 40 students into its blended supply chain management program from graduates of its MicroMasters program, reducing its usual 10-month program to 5 months. This pilot also saw 200,000 people signing up, 19,000 earning certificates and 800 sitting for the final proctored examination. It was reported in July 2018 that the students who were admitted into the blended program had better than average scores across the board than those who were in the residential program. The MIT Statistics and Data Science Center has also announced the launch of its MicroMasters program in Statistics and Data Science slated for the fall of 2018. \n\nIn July 2018, the University of Maryland announced a MicroMasters program for a MBA core curriculum, offering graduates transferable credits to a full MBA degree. In September 2018, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority provided its employees with the opportunity to join the MicroMasters program in data, economics, and development policy led by Esther Duflo as part of a strategy to develop the capabilities of young Emiratis. \n\n"}

{"id": "65071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65071", "title": "Monster", "text": "Monster\n\nA monster is often a hideously grotesque animal or human, or a hybrid of both, whose appearance frightens and whose powers of destruction threaten the human world's social or moral order.\n\nAnimal monsters are outside the moral order, but sometimes have their origin in some human violation of the moral law (e.g. in the Greek myth, Minos does not sacrifice the white bull Poseidon sent him to the god, so as punishment Poseidon makes Minos' wife, Pasiphaë, fall in love with the bull, and she copulates with the beast, and gives birth to the man with a bull's head, the Minotaur). Human monsters are those who by birth were never fully human (Medusa and her sisters) or who through some supernatural or unnatural act lost their humanity (werewolves, Frankenstein's monster), and so who can no longer, or who never could, follow the moral law of human society.\n\nMonsters pre-date written history, and the academic study of the particular cultural notions expressed in a society's ideas of monsters is known as \"monstrophy\".\n\nMonsters have appeared in literature and in feature-length films. Well-known monsters in fiction include Count Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, werewolves, mummies, and zombies.\n\n\"Monster\" derives from the Latin \"monstrum\", itself derived ultimately from the verb \"moneo\" (\"to remind, warn, instruct, or foretell\"), and denotes anything \"strange or singular, contrary to the usual course of nature, by which the gods give notice of evil,\" \"a strange, unnatural, hideous person, animal, or thing,\" or any \"monstrous or unusual thing, circumstance, or adventure.\" \n\nIn the words of Tina Marie Boyer, assistant professor of medieval German literature at Wake Forest University, \"monsters do not emerge out of a cultural void; they have a literary and cultural heritage\".\n\nIn the religious context of ancient Greeks and Romans, monsters were seen as signs of \"divine displeasure\", and it was thought that birth defects were especially ominous, being \"an unnatural event\" or \"a malfunctioning of nature\".\n\nMonsters are not necessarily abominations however. The Roman historian Suetonius, for instance, describes a snake's absence of legs or a bird's ability to fly as monstrous, as both are \"against nature\". Nonetheless, the negative connotations of the word quickly established themselves, and by the playwright and philosopher Seneca's time, the word had extended into its philosophical meaning, \"a visual and horrific revelation of the truth\".\n\nIn spite of this, mythological monsters such as the Hydra and Medusa are not natural beings, but divine entities. This seems to be a holdover from Proto-Indo-European religion and other belief systems, in which the divisions between \"spirit,\" \"monster,\" and \"god\" were less evident.\n\nThe history of monsters in fiction is long, for example Grendel in the epic poem \"Beowulf\" is an archetypal monster, deformed, brutal, with enormous strength and raiding a human settlement nightly to slay and feed on his victims. The modern literary monster has its roots on examples such as the monster in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and the vampire in Bram Stoker's Dracula.\n\nMonsters are a staple of fantasy fiction, horror fiction or science fiction (where the monsters are often extraterrestrial in nature). There is also a burgeoning subgenre of erotic fiction involving monsters, monster erotica.\n\nDuring the age of silent films, monsters tended to be human-sized, e.g. Frankenstein's monster, the Golem, werewolves and vampires. The film \"Siegfried\" featured a dragon that consisted of stop-motion animated models, as in RKO's \"King Kong\", the first giant monster film of the sound era.\n\nUniversal Studios specialized in monsters, with Bela Lugosi's reprisal of his stage role, Dracula, and Boris Karloff playing Frankenstein's monster. The studio also made several lesser films, such as \"Man-Made Monster\", starring Lon Chaney, Jr. as a carnival side-show worker who is turned into an electrically charged killer, able to dispatch victims merely by touching them, causing death by electrocution.\n\nThere was also a variant of Dr. Frankenstein, the mad surgeon Dr. Gogol (played by Peter Lorre), who transplanted hands that were reanimated with malevolent temperaments, in the film \"Mad Love\".\nWerewolves were introduced in films during this period, and similar creatures were presented in \"Cat People\". Mummies were cinematically depicted as fearsome monsters as well. As for giant creatures, the cliffhanger of the first episode of the 1936 \"Flash Gordon\" serial did not use a costumed actor, instead using real-life lizards to depict a pair of battling dragons via use of camera perspective. However, the cliffhanger of the ninth episode of the same serial had a man in a rubber suit play the Fire Dragon, which picks up a doll representing Flash in its claws. The cinematic monster cycle eventually wore thin, having a comedic turn in \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\" (1948).\nFRANKENSTEIN\n\nIn the post–World War II era, however, giant monsters returned to the screen with a vigor that has been causally linked to the development of nuclear weapons. One early example occurred in the American film \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\", which was about a dinosaur that attacked a lighthouse. Subsequently, there were Japanese film depictions, (Godzilla, Gamera), British depictions (\"Gorgo\"), and even Danish depictions (\"Reptilicus\"), of giant monsters attacking cities. A recent depiction of a giant monster is depicted in J. J. Abrams's \"Cloverfield\", which was released in theaters January 18, 2008. The intriguing proximity of other planets brought the notion of extraterrestrial monsters to the big screen, some of which were huge in size (such as King Ghidorah and Gigan), while others were of a more human scale. During this period, the fish-man monster Gill-man was developed in the film series \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\".\n\nBritain's Hammer Film Productions brought color to the monster movies in the late 1950s. Around this time, the earlier Universal films were usually shown on American television by independent stations (rather than network stations) by using announcers with strange personas, who gained legions of young fans. Although they have since changed considerably, movie monsters did not entirely disappear from the big screen as they did in the late 1940s.\n\nOccasionally, monsters are depicted as friendly or misunderstood creatures. King Kong and Frankenstein's monster are two examples of misunderstood creatures. Frankenstein's monster is frequently depicted in this manner, in films such as \"Monster Squad\" and \"Van Helsing\". The Hulk is an example of the \"Monster as Hero\" archetype. The theme of the \"Friendly Monster\" is pervasive in pop-culture. Chewbacca, Elmo, and Shrek are notable examples of friendly \"monsters\". The creatures of \"Monsters, Inc.\" scare children in order to create energy for running machinery, while the furry monsters of \"The Muppets\" and \"Sesame Street\" live in harmony with animals and humans alike. Japanese culture also commonly features monsters which are benevolent or likable, with the most famous examples being the \"Pokémon\" franchise and the pioneering anime \"My Neighbor Totoro\". The book series/webisodes/toy line of Monster High is another example.\nMonsters are commonly encountered in fantasy or role-playing games and video games as enemies for players to fight against. They may include aliens, legendary creatures, extra-dimensional entities or mutated versions of regular animals.\n\nEspecially in role-playing games, \"monster\" is a catch-all term for hostile characters that are fought by the player. Sentient fictional races are usually not referred to as monsters. At other times, the term can carry a neutral connotation, such as in the \"Pokémon\" franchise, where it is used to refer to fictional creatures that resemble real-world animals/objects. Characters in games may refer to all animals as \"monsters\".\n\nMonsters in legend\n\nMonsters in fiction\n\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n"}
{"id": "16447220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16447220", "title": "Māori traditional textiles", "text": "Māori traditional textiles\n\nMāori traditional textiles are the indigenous textiles of the Māori people of New Zealand. The organisation Te Roopu Raranga Whatu o Aotearoa, the national Māori weavers' collective, aims to preserve and foster the skills of making and using these materials.\n\nMāori made textiles from a number of plants, including harakeke, wharariki, tī kōuka, tōī, pingao, kiekie and toetoe—although the paper mulberry was introduced by Māori, who knew it as aute, it seems not to have thrived and bark cloth (tapa) was always rare.\n\nThe prepared fibre (muka) of the New Zealand flax (\"Phormium tenax\") became the basis of most clothing. The flax leaves were split and woven into mats, ropes and nets but clothing was often made from the fibre within the leaves. The leaves were stripped using a mussel shell, dressed by soaking and pounding with stone pounders, (\"patu muka\"), to soften the fibre, spun by rolling the thread against the leg and woven. The fibre within the flax is called muka.\n\nColours for dyeing muka were sourced from indigenous materials. Paru (mud high in iron salts) provided black, raurekau bark made yellow, and tānekaha bark made a tan colour. The colours were set by rolling the dyed muka in alum (potash).\n\nThere were two main types of garments -\n\n\nMen's belts were known as tatua and women's as tu. The man's belt was usually the more ornate. Belts were usually made of flax but occasionally other materials were used such as kiekie and pingao. Flax belts were often plaited in patterns with black and white stripes. The belts tied with a string tie. Women often wore a belt composed of many strands of plaited fibre.\n\nThe weaving process (whatu) for clothing was performed not with a loom and shuttle but with the threads being manipulated and tied with fingers. A strong thread is fastened tautly in a horizontal position between two or four upright weaving sticks (turuturu). To this thread (tawhiu) are attached the upper ends of the warp or vertical threads (io). The warp is arranged close together. The weaving process consisted of working in cross-threads from left to right. The closer these threads are together, the tighter the weave, and the finer the garment.\n\nIn the case of fine garments four threads are employed in the forming of each aho. The weaver passes two of these threads on either side of the first io or vertical thread, enclosing it. In the continuing the process the two pairs of threads are reversed, those passing behind the first vertical thread would be brought in front of the next one, then behind the next and so on. Each of the down threads would be enclosed between two or four cross-threads every half inch or so.\n\nTo meet the cold and wet conditions of the New Zealand winter, a rain cloak called pake or hieke was worn. It was made from tags of raw flax or \"Cordyline\" partly scraped and set in close rows attached to the muka or plaited fibre base.\n\nA type of garment known as a pake karure was made of two-ply closed strands of hukahuka (twisted or rolled cord or tag) interspersed with occasional black-dyed two-ply open type karure (loosely twisted) muka thread cord. Garments such as these were worn interchangeably either around the waist as a piupiu, or across the shoulder as a cape. These types of garments are thought to pre-date European contact, later becoming a more specialised form during the mid to later nineteenth century, which continues today in the standardised form of the piupiu.\n\nPiupiu are a kind of grass skirt. The waistband is plaited or in some cases made from \"tāniko\". The body of the piupiu is usually made from flax leaves that are carefully prepared with the \"muka\" or flax fibre exposed in some sections to cause geometric patterns to emerge. The unscraped leaves will curl naturally into tubes as the leaves dry, and make a percussion sound when the wearer sways or moves. The geometric patterns can be emphasised through dyeing as the dye will soak more into the exposed fibres rather than the dried raw leaf.\n\nThe Captain of HMS New \"Zealand\", a battlecruiser funded in 1911 by the government of New Zealand for the defence of the British Empire and which took an active part in three battles of the First World War, wore into battle a piupiu (as well as a hei-tiki, Māori traditional pendant). The crew attributed to this the \"New Zealand\" being a \"lucky ship\" which sustained no casualties during the entire war.\n\nThere were a number of different types of fine cloaks including korowai, kaitaka, kahu huruhuru and kahu kurī, all woven from muka (prepared harakeke fibre) using the tāniko technique.\n\nKorowai are finely woven cloaks covered with muka tassels (hukahuka). Hukahuka are made by the miro (twist thread) process of dying the muka (flax fibre) and rolling two bundles into a single cord which is then woven into the body of the cloak. There are many different types of korowai that are named depending on the type of hukahuka used as the decoration. Korowai karure have tassels (hukahuka) that appear to be unravelling. Korowai ngore have hukahuka that look like pompoms. Korowai hihima had undyed tassels.\n\nKorowai seem to have been rare at the time of Captain Cook's first visit to New Zealand because they do not appear in drawings made by his artists. But by 1844, when George French Angas painted historical accounts of early New Zealand, korowai with their black hukahuka had become the most popular style. Hukahuka on fine examples of korowai were often up to thirty centimetres long and when made correctly would move freely with every movement of the wearer. Today, many old korowai have lost their black hukahuka due to the dying process speeding up the deterioration of the muka.\n\nKaitaka are cloaks of finely woven muka (\"Phormium tenax\") fibre. Kaitaka are among the more prestigious forms of traditional Maori dress. They are made from muka (flax fibre), which is in turn made from those varieties of \"Phormium tenax\" that yield the finest quality fibre characterised by a silk-like texture and rich golden sheen. Kaitaka are usually adorned with broad tāniko borders at the remu (bottom) and narrow tāniko bands along the kauko (sides). The ua (upper border) is plain and undecorated, and the kaupapa (main body) is usually unadorned. There are several sub-categories of kaitaka: parawai, where the aho (wefts) run horizontally; kaitaka paepaeroa, where the aho run vertically; kaitaka aronui or patea, where the aho run horizontally with tāniko bands on the sides and bottom borders; huaki, where the aho run horizontally with taniko bands on the sides and two broad taniko bands, one above the other, on the lower border; and huaki paepaeroa, which has vertical aho with double tāniko bands on the lower border.\n\nFine feather cloaks called kahu huruhuru were made of muka fibre with bird feathers woven in to cover the entire cloak. These feather cloaks became more common during between 1850 and 1900, when cloaks were evolving in their production. Some early examples include kahu kiwi (kiwi feather cloak), which used the soft brown feathers of the kiwi (\"Apteryx\" spp). Kahu kiwi were regarded as the most prestigious form of kahu huruhuru. Other kahu huruhuru incorporated the green and white feathers of the kererū (New Zealand pigeon: \"Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae\") and blue feathers from the tūī (\"Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae\").\n\nA particularly rare type of cloak is the kahu kurī, made from strips of dog skin with hair attached taken from the now extinct kurī (Māori dog).\n\nThe main body of the cloak is made up of strips of white-haired dog skin of various lengths, which are sewn onto the kaupapa (main body) of the cloak with fine bone needles to form a tightly woven muka (flax fibre) foundation called pukupuku. The pukupuku weaving technique uses the whatu-aho-patahi (single pair twine) method, which is very similar to the decorative geometric tāniko (fine embroidery or weaving in a geometric pattern) border designs usually seen on the kaitaka (fine flax cloak) class of cloak, and forms a thick and heavy protective garment. The awe (the tassels that fringe the outside length of the cloak) is likely to have been taken from the underside of the dog's tail. The kurupatu (plaited hem on the cloak edge) is entirely separate to the main kaupapa and made by threading separate strips together to form a length of collar that has been sewn onto the neck of the finished garment.\n\nKahu kurī are garments possessing great mana (status) and were highly prized heirlooms. Each garment had its own personal name and its history was carefully preserved right up to the time they passed out of Maori ownership. However, most are in museum collections around the world and have lost their provenance. The possession of a kahu kurī immediately identified the owner as a rangatira (chief) or someone who possessed prestige and position within the hapū (family) or iwi (tribe). They were often exchanged between people of rank on important ceremonial occasions and affirmed both the mana of the giver and the recipient. Kahu kurī were made largely between 1500 and 1850, and it is thought that production had ceased altogether by the early nineteenth century.\n\nThere are several different varieties of kahu kurī and some tribal variation in the application of the descriptive terms of these types. Some of the types recorded include topuni, ihupuni, awarua, kahuwaero, mahiti, and puahi, but the construction technique remains essentially the same.\n\nTāniko (or taaniko) refers to any ornamental border typically found on mats and clothes. Tāniko patterns are very geometric in form because they can be reduced down to small coloured squares repeated on a lattice framework. These base square forms, articulated in the hands of a weaver, constitute the larger diamond and triangle shapes that are visible in all traditional weaving crafts.\n\nPātiki or pātikitiki (flounder/flat fish: \"Rhombosolea plebeia\") designs are based on the lozenge or diamond shape of the flounder. They can be quite varied within the basic shape.\n\nThe kaokao (side or rib) pattern is formed by zigzag lines that create chevrons. These can be horizontal or vertical, open with paces or closed repetitive lines. The design is sometimes interpreted as the arms of warriors caught in haka (fierce rhythmic dance) action.\n\nThe niho taniwha (taniwha tooth) pattern is a notched-tooth design found on all types of objects, mats, woven panels, belts, and clothing.\n\nThe poutama is a stepped design signifying the growth of man, striving ever upwards.\n\nTahekeheke (striped) designs refer to any distinct vertical patterning.\n\nThe whetū (stars), purapura whetū (weaving pattern of stars) or roimata (teardrop) pattern is a geometric design using two colours and alternating between them at every stitch. This design is associated with the survival of an iwi (tribe), hapū (sub-tribe), or whānau (extended family), the idea being that it is vital to have a large whanau, just as there are many stars in the Milky Way.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21891", "title": "NATO reporting name", "text": "NATO reporting name\n\nNATO reporting names are code names for military equipment of Russia, China, and, historically, the former Eastern Bloc (Soviet Union and other nations of the Warsaw Pact). They provide unambiguous and easily understood English words in a uniform manner in place of the original designations, which either may have been unknown to the Western world at the time or easily confused codes. For example, the Russian bomber jet Tupolev Tu-160 is simply called Blackjack.\n\nNATO maintains lists of the names. The assignment of the names for the Russian and Chinese aircraft was once managed by the five-nation Air Standardization Coordinating Committee (ASCC) (now called the Air and Space Interoperability Council, or ASIC, which includes representatives of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States), but that is no longer the case.\n\nThe United States Department of Defense (US DoD) expands on the NATO reporting names in some cases. NATO refers to surface-to-air missile systems mounted on ships or submarines with the same names as the corresponding land-based systems, but the US DoD assigns a different series of numbers with a different suffix (i.e., SA-N- vs. SA-) for these systems. The names are kept the same as a convenience. Where there is no corresponding system, a new name is devised.\n\nThe Soviet Union did not always assign official \"popular names\" to its aircraft, but unofficial nicknames were common as in any air force. Generally, Soviet pilots did not use the NATO names, preferring a different, Russian, nickname. An exception was that Soviet airmen appreciated the MiG-29's codename \"Fulcrum\", as an indication of its pivotal role in Soviet air defence.\n\nTo reduce the risk of confusion, unusual or made-up names were allocated, the idea being that the names chosen would be unlikely to occur in normal conversation, and be easier to memorise. For fixed-wing aircraft, single-syllable words denoted piston-prop and turboprop, while multiple-syllable words denoted jets. Bombers had names starting with the letter \"B\" and names like \"Badger\" (2 syllables: jet), \"Bear\" (single syllable: propeller), and \"Blackjack\" were used. \"Frogfoot,\" the reporting name for the Sukhoi Su-25, references the aircraft's close air support role. Transports had names starting with \"C\" (as in \"cargo\"), which resulted in names like \"Condor\" or \"Candid\".\n\nThe initial letter of the name indicated the use of that equipment.\n\n\nThe first letter indicates the type of aircraft, like \"B\"ear for a bomber aircraft, or \"F\"ulcrum for a fighter aircraft.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Usually such sites are listed in a heritage register that is open to the public, and many are advertised by national visitor bureaus as tourist attractions.\n\nUsually such a heritage register list is split by type of feature (natural wonder, ruin, engineering marvel, etc.). In many cases a country may maintain more than one register; there are also registers for entities that span more than one country. \n\nEach country has its own national heritage list and naming conventions. Sites can be added to a list, and are occasionally removed and even destroyed for economic or other reasons. The concept of protecting and taking pride in cultural heritage is something that goes back to the Seven Wonders of the World, but usually it is only after destruction, especially mass destruction in times of war, that new lists are drawn up or revisited. Many countries acknowledge under UNESCO their designation of objects considered to be worthy of having importance to the entire world or world heritage. These listings also acknowledge the need for a separate list of objects judged part of their own unique cultural heritage. The concept of a \"national heritage site\" can be split into many types, each type having its own unique list. \n\nTwo major types of cultural heritage are \"immoveable\" and \"moveable\" objects. Immoveable objects are usually buildings, locations such as gardens or areas such as city districts. Small moveable objects may include old books or artworks, large moveable objects may include automobiles, aircraft and ships. \n\nIn the case of a national heritage site in a populated area, monitoring and protection may be under the jurisdiction of a fire department or local police department, whereas more remote sites may be under the protection of a central conservation agency.\n\nMost countries have passed laws to protect national heritage sites, with various classifications for owners. In Europe, many countries uphold the Venice Charter of 1964 though each country's name and criteria for protection, may change.\n\nThe UNESCO keeps a list of heritage sites per country that are considered internationally important. These sites are almost always also on the national heritage register of the site's country.\n\n"}
{"id": "1493998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1493998", "title": "Nebulous", "text": "Nebulous\n\nNebulous is a post-apocalyptic science fiction comedy radio show written by Graham Duff and produced by Ted Dowd from Baby Cow Productions; it is directed by Nicholas Briggs. The series premiered in the United Kingdom on BBC Radio 4. Set in the year 2099 AD, the show focuses on the adventures of the eponymous Professor Nebulous, director of operations for the eco-troubleshooting team KENT \"(the Key Environmental Non-Judgmental Taskforce)\" as they combat various catastrophes and try to set the world back on the right path following a worldwide environmental disaster known as \"The Withering\". As well as being a parody of a number of famous science fiction programmes, including \"Doctor Who\", \"Quatermass\" and \"Doomwatch\", \"Nebulous\" is considered a cult radio programme, attracting a number of guest appearances from famous actors.\n\nThere have been three series of \"Nebulous\"; the first was broadcast between 6 January and 10 February 2005. The series was well received by critics, and a second series was broadcast between 5 April and 10 May 2006, with a third series commissioned by the BBC which began broadcasting on Thursday, 15 May 2008 at 23:00 BST. The first series was released on compact disc on 5 February 2007 by BBC Audio. Since 2009 all three series have been broadcast on BBC Radio 7. Duff has also announced that he is planning to make an animated series of \"Nebulous\".\n\nThe development of the series began with the production pilot episode, written by Graham Duff and produced by Baby Cow Productions in March 2003. The episode, which eventually became \"Night of the Vegetarians\", featured much of the final cast, but with a number of differences: a different actor played Rory, and Sir Ronald Rolands was voiced by Duff, while Gemini originally had two voices: a female voice played by Julia Dalkin, and a male voice by Nicholas Briggs. Malcolm Boyle - who wrote the Nebulous theme and edited the pilot - had written an entire original score for the show. However, due to BBC radio budget limitations, this was not used in the completed series. Nicholas Briggs had also originally created a very deep, realistic soundscape, similar to those he had created for the Big Finish Productions \"Doctor Who\" audioplays, but was advised that \"it's likely the listener will have distractions and will not listen to it more than once; therefore, the soundscape must be totally accessible from any point in the episode\", toning down the sound effects to match the series' comic nature.\n\nThe Moat Studios in London recorded \"Nebulous\" in stereo, with each half-hour episode typically taking one day to record, including read-through and rehearsal. Nicholas Briggs produced the sound, using a combination of synthesised effects from a Roland SH-101 and foley sound effects. Briggs also carried out the studio editing in order to bring the 30-minute episodes down to the 28 minutes mandated by the BBC to allow time for radio trailers between programmes.\n\nSet in the year 2099, the series depicts the Earth as very different from today. Following a number of environmental disasters, such as \"the Withering\" – which resulted in the loss of a great deal of human knowledge including the vacuum cleaner and fire (although the latter came back fairly quickly) – and a \"Cattle-clasm\" that killed off most of the livestock, the Earth has been reduced to a wasteland separated between \"Withered Zones\" and the remaining inhabitable areas. The Withering shifted the Earth into a new orbit, resulting in disruption to the seasons and a reformed calendar. Every day of the week is now 25-hours long except for Thursday (which, due to time anomalies, has not occurred in over a decade), while the change in the length of the year led to the creation of new months such as Janril, Febtober, and Marchuary. In addition, the dreary season of Hamble was created, which is permanently dark, cold and drizzly. The Withering resulted in vegetarians, pigeons and gays becoming endangered species, and completely wiped out tarts.\n\nThe Earth's geography is also radically altered. A new mountain range was formed in Britain by a day-long ice age, and the Earth now has twelve and a half continents. Many locations have been displaced and reduced to islands, including Oxford University and the London borough of Deptford, which is now in the Indonesian Ocean as a part of the Cockney Islands. The solar system is equally altered: Jupiter has been deep fried by Harry Ramsden's, Mercury and Neptune have been knocked together, and there was an initiative to destroy the Moon, which according to the show was deleterious to the nightlight industry.\n\nReligion also exists in the \"Nebulous\" universe. Pieced together following the Withering, theologians conclude that there were four true deities: the evil twins Yin and Yang, Feng Shui the destroyer, and merciful Bod, based on the children's television programme \"Bod\", the theme tune of which has become a hymn, sung in Gregorian chant. Bod is analogous to God, hence the commonly used phrase \"Oh my Bod!\"\n\n\"Nebulous\" follows the adventures of the eco-troubleshooting team \"KENT\" (the \"Key Environmental Non-Judgmental Taskforce\", named after the English county of Kent). The group is directed by Professor Nebulous toward the goal of restoring a natural balance to Earth. However, they are woefully under-funded; KENT was forced to open a laundry to supplement funds. There is at least one other eco-troubleshooting team based in England, but despite their common goals they have a less-than-hospitable view of each other. LOUGHBOROUGH (the \"Legitimate Organisation Undertaking General Humanitarian Business Operations Requiring Optimum Unconditional Global Harmony\", named after the Leicestershire town Loughborough) is run by Professor Nebulous’ ex-love interest, Doctor Erica Flazenby. By comparison to KENT it is over-funded and well-equipped, with bazers, black helicopters and info pills, which provide the user with information by ingestion.\n\n\"Nebulous\" both parodies and pays homage to several well known science fiction programmes and films in both its setting and plotlines, often incorporating several different elements within a single story: Professor Nebulous himself is similar to Bernard Quatermass, a British scientist who led a research group and fought aliens in the classic science fiction serial \"The Quatermass Experiment\" and its sequels. KENT itself is based partly on the Department of Measurement of Scientific Work, nicknamed \"Doomwatch\", the eponymous organisation from the BBC science fiction television programme \"Doomwatch\", and partly on the Doctor Who Organization \"U.N.I.T\", otherwise known as the \"United Nations Intelligence Taskforce\". The second episode of series one, \"The Loverly Invasion\", is a direct spoof of the \"Doctor Who\" episode \"The Claws of Axos\", while \"The Deptford Wives\" takes both its name and premise from \"The Stepford Wives\" (and also borrows from \"Jurassic Park\"). From the first episode of series 3 onwards, this also began to include the recent \"Doctor Who\" spin-off \"Torchwood\" and the ITV series \"Primeval\", with references to \"baby dinosaurs falling through a hole in time\" and \"the sheer amount of paranormal activity in the Cardiff area alone ... starting to threaten the Earth's plausibility shield\". Episode 6 of that series also parodied the tendency in British sci-fi for attempts to take over the world to start in Britain, with the chief villain (played by Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant) stating \"Funnily enough, that's a tax thing,\" as well as one of the Ninth Doctor's nicknames, (with Nebulous known as \"the oncoming drizzle\").\n\n\nFollowing positive reviews and high listening figures, the second series was able to attract a number of guest appearances from well known actors, including Peter Davison, Steve Coogan, and Kate O'Mara. The third series featured appearances from Julia Davis and David Tennant.\n\nReception to \"Nebulous\" was generally positive: a reviewer from \"The Times\" described the first series as \"a winning blend of Doomwatch, Quatermass and British silliness that has cult written all over it\", while the second series was described as \"cool and cultish\". However, \"The Daily Telegraph\" was more guarded, comparing the show to \"Hitchhiker's without the philosophy or Red Dwarf without the energy\", going on to say that show is \"funny, but not seriously so\". A reviewer for \"Doctor Who\" website UnitNews also initially expressed concerns about the level of jokes in the show, but later claimed \"I should have been more patient because when they did arrive, coinciding with the introduction of the character Harry, they were relentlessly funny\".\n\n"}

The high level of importance placed on it by historians and archaeologists is due to its well preserved and richly decorated nature.\n\nThe drum was accidentally discovered in 1893 in Hà Nam Province, southeast of Hanoi, by workers building a dike, rather than during a planned expedition. The drum was named after the Confucian name of the village where it was found, \"Ngọc Lũ\" (Sino-Vietnamese 玉缕, vernacular tên chữ name \"Làng Chủ\") in Bình Lục District.\n\nIn contrast to most other drums of the Dong Son, the tympanum bears three concentric panels, which depict animals or humans, interleaved with bands of geometric or circular patterns. The innermost panel appears to be a self-referencing depiction, as it is decorated with pictures of humans who appear to be performing a ceremony involving the drums themselves. Other musical instruments and rice growing and harvesting activities are also shown. The two outer panels are decorated with scenes of deer, hornbills and crane egrets.\n\nThe inner panel repeats itself, despite the presence of minor variations. The scenes are the subject of multiple interpretations, but a prominent motif is that of a row of figures who appear to be male. They are plumed, and led by a man holding a spear that is directed towards the ground. He is followed in the line by five more men, at least two of whom appear to playing musical instruments. One appears to be playing a \"khen\" and either cymbals or bells, while another holds a wand-like object in his left hand. The men are wearing a type of kilt and highly feathered headgear, which includes a figure in the shape of a bird's head.\n\nAhead of the leader, there is some sort of a structure that is supported by stilts with either decorated timber walls or some sort of streamers held at the eaves. A board of gongs is being percussed by a person wearing a kilt, but is not wearing a feathered headdress. Three people depicted beyond the house also do not have any headwear, with two having long hair and another with bun-tied hair. Two of the people are depicted threshing rice with a pole ornamented with feathers, while the other is shooing away a hornbill. A house is depicted beyond them which has decorated posts erected at a sharp angle, close to vertical, which is decorated with what appears to be feathers or streamers. The ends of the gables are further decorated with birds' heads. There are three people depicted inside the house, possibly playing percussion instruments.\n\nThere is also a scene where one standing person and three seated people are brandishing long poles that appear to be used to strike a row of drums placed in front of them. This scene is repeated with a few variations. In one scene the drums are all of identical size, while in the others their sizes are sequenced. One percussionist uses one striking device, while another uses two for each hand. There are further variations of this scene with seated and standing percussionists.\n\nArchaeologists are agreed that the scene is likely to depict a festival or ritual of some kind, with the musicians appearing to be part of a parade. The feathered men contrast with those depicted in the house, who have unkempt hair and appear to be female. The decoration on the mantle of the drum depicts plumed warriors in a procession of elegant pirogues with decorated timbers. Birds' heads are found on their headgear, the ends of their water transport vessels and even the rudder.\n"}

The name of the program is often reversed to One Book One City, or is customized to name the city where it occurs. Popular book picks have been Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", Ernest Gaines's \"A Lesson Before Dying\", Ray Bradbury's \"Fahrenheit 451\", and Rudolfo Anaya's \"Bless Me, Ultima\".\n\nOne City One Book programs take the idea of a localized book discussion club and expand it to cover a whole city.\nThe first such program was \"If All of Seattle Read the Same Book\" in 1998, started by Nancy Pearl at Seattle Public Library's Washington Center for the Book.\nThe book chosen for the program was 'The Sweet Hereafter' by Russell Banks, written in 1991. Other cities copied the idea, and the Library of Congress listed 404 programs occurring in 2007.\n\nEach city's program has its own goals; these typically include building a sense of community and promoting literacy.\nNancy Pearl warns against expecting too much from a program: \"Keep in mind that this is a library program, it's not an exercise in civics, it's not intended to have literature cure the racial divide. This is about a work of literature.\"\n\nPrograms typically involve more than having everyone read the same book. Some other activities that have been included are: book discussion sessions, scholarly lectures on the book or related topics, a visit by the author, exhibits, related arts programming (especially showing a movie of the book if there is one), and integration into school curricula.\nIn Boston the \"One City One Story\" program used shorter stories and distributed tens of thousands of free copies of the story over the course of a month.\n\nAmerican Library Association puts out a detailed step-by-step guide on how to organize a local program, including the critical step of picking the one book. The Center for the Book at the Library of Congress tracks all known programs and the books they have used.\n\n\"Most listed are in the United States, perhaps because the meme started there and similar programs elsewhere have a different name.\"\n\nPrograms sponsored by public libraries are tracked each year by the Library of Congress. Most programs maintain their own websites devoted to the annual effort.\n\nThe Library of Congress maintains a website with resources for cities that want to run One Book programs, including a partial list of authors and list of past programs. Some states and the ALA maintain their own resources to help cities get started.\n\n\n\nCity Reads, Brighton is the longest running and most consistent 'big read' in the UK. Led by artistic director Sarah Hutchings, it is delivered by award-winning literary organisation Collected Works CIC. City Reads is an annual collective reading festival conceived to spread a love of books and ideas to the widest possible audience throughout Brighton & Hove, with a healthy reach into the South East region. Over three weeks in October one book is chosen for the whole community to creatively engage with in a series of special events, workshops and performances. Through the outstanding quality of its work, its ability to foster collaboration and the partnerships that support the Festival, City Reads brings regional and national attention to the importance of shared reading and the benefits it can bring to the whole community. 2015 marks the 10th anniversary of City Reads, Brighton. The City Reads slogan is: One city. One book. A thousand conversations... The Festival began in 2005 when the City celebrated Penguin Books' 70th Anniversary and read Lewis Carroll's \"Alice in Wonderland\". In 2013, with the support of writer, broadcaster and former children's laureate Michael Rosen Young City Reads was launched. Working with primary aged children at KS2 level, Young City Reads is thought to be the first 'big read' for children in the UK, on such a large scale.\n\nSouthampton University:\nOne Book, One Southampton (OBOS) is the University of Southampton’s initiative to engage with our community through reading. Similar initiatives have been trialled in other institutions internationally, but there are very few UK University One Book programmes. The University encourage staff, students and our local and international community to join us in debates, lectures, talks and online forums to discuss OBOS and explore the themes, subjects and debates that the book raises. You can listen to discussions on the subject, and attend events about the book. The University of Southampton announced that the 2014 book will be Empire by Jeremy Paxman. \nSome cities that have run independent One Book programs have later joined Big Read instead. An annual \"One World, Many Stories\" summer reading campaign for children, which has a single selection for the country, has become popular as well.\n\nFor some, the mere idea of reading as a communal activity is repellent. The literary critic Harold Bloom said, \"I don't like these mass reading bees... It is rather like the idea that we are all going to pop out and eat Chicken McNuggets or something else horrid at once.\"\n\nOthers are concerned about the temptation to use such a program to promote social values. Phillip Lopate fears a promotion of groupthink, saying \"It is a little like a science fiction plot -- 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' or something.\"\n\nIn New York City in 2002, the effort foundered when the selectors split into two rival groups, each with its own favorite: Chang-Rae Lee's \"Native Speaker\" and James McBride's \"The Color of Water\". Both books were considered to be offensive to some of New York's ethnic groups.\nNancy Pearl said,\n\"It's turned into something not to do with literature but to do with curing the ills in society, and while there is a role for that, to ask a book to fit everybody's agenda in talking about particular issues just does a disservice to literature.\"\n\nGovernments are sometimes concerned that their endorsement of reading a book will be viewed as endorsing the ideas or language of the book. In Texas in 2006, the Galveston County Reads committee recommended Mark Haddon's \"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\" as the choice for their county-wide read. There was much criticism of the choice from the Mayor and Council of Friendswood, who objected to obscenity in the novel, and said that it contained ideas that should not be promoted to kids and that taxpayer money should not be used to promote and purchase a book the community wouldn't approve of.\n"}

{"id": "9031507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9031507", "title": "River valley civilization", "text": "River valley civilization\n\nA river valley civilization or river culture is an agricultural nation or civilization situated beside and drawing sustenance from a river. A \"civilization\" means a society with large permanent settlements featuring urban development, social stratification, specialization of labour, centralized organization, and written or other formal means of communication. A river gives the inhabitants a reliable source of water for drinking and agriculture. Additional benefits include fishing, fertile soil due to annual flooding, and ease of transportation. The first great civilizations, such as those in Mesopotamia and Egypt, all grew up in river valleys.\n\nCivilization first began in 3500 BC, which along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in the Middle East; the name given to that civilization, Mesopotamia, means \"land between the rivers\". The Nile valley in Egypt had been home to agricultural settlements as early as 5500 BC, but the growth of Egypt as a civilization began around 3100 BC. A third civilization grew up along the Indus River around 2600 BC, in parts of what are now India and Pakistan. The fourth great river civilization emerged around 1700 BC along the Yellow River in China, also known as the Huang-He River Civilization.\n\nCivilizations tended to grow up in river valleys for a number of reasons. The most obvious is access to a usually reliable source of water for agriculture and human needs. Plentiful water, and the enrichment of the soil due to annual floods, made it possible to grow excess crops beyond what was needed to sustain an agricultural village. This allowed for some members of the community to engage in non-agricultural activities such as construction of buildings and cities (the root of the word \"civilization\"), metal working, trade, and social organization. Boats on the river provided an easy and efficient way to transport people and goods, allowing for the development of trade and facilitating central control of outlying areas.\n\nMesopotamia was the earliest river valley civilization, starting to form around 3500 BC. The civilization was created after regular trading started relationships between multiple cities and states around the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Mesopotamian cities became self-run civil governments. One of the cities within this civilization, Uruk, was the first literate society in history. Eventually, they all joined together to irrigate the two rivers in order to make their dry land fertile for agricultural growth. The increase in successful farming in this civilization allowed population growth throughout the cities and states within Mesopotamia.\n\nEgypt also created irrigation systems from its local river, the Nile River, more intricate than previous systems. The Egyptians would rotate legumes with cereal which would stop salt buildup from the fresh water and enhance the fertility of their fields. The Nile River also allowed easier travel among the civilization, eventually resulting in the creation of two kingdoms in the north and south areas of the river until both were unified into one society by 3000 BC.\n\nMuch of the history of the Indus valley civilization is unknown. Discovered in the 1920s, Harappan society remains a mystery because the Harappan system of writing has not yet been deciphered. It was larger than either Egypt or Mesopotamia. Historians have found no evidence of violence or a ruling class; there are no distinctive burial sites and there is not a lot of evidence to suggest a formal military. However, historians believe that the lack of knowledge about the ruling class and the military is mainly due to the inability to read Harappan writing.\n\nThe Yellow River (Huang He) area became settled around 4000 BCE. Many tribes settled along the river, sixth longest in the world, which was distinguished by its heavy load of yellow silt and its periodic devastating floods. A major impetus for the tribes to unite into a single kingdom by around 1500 BCE was the desire to find a solution to the frequent deadly floods. The Yellow River is often called \"The Cradle of Chinese Civilization\".\n\n\n"}

It differs from the other Ros-Beiaard horses because it is used only once every ten years and because the horse is carried by people. The Ros Beiaard is on UNESCO's list of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\n\n\nThe Ros Beiaard of Dendermonde is carried through the town every ten years by a guild of bearers, called the 'Pijnders'. In keeping with the legend, four young brothers from Dendermonde (de Vier Heemskinderen) wearing full armour sit astride the horse. The legend of Ros Beiaard is acted out during the procession.\n\nFrom the ground to the tallest part of the head, the Ros Beiaard is 4.85m high. If one adds the decorations on top, then the horse is 5.8m high. From nose to tail, the Ros is 5.2m long and the width is exactly 2m. The head of the Ros Beiaard is made out of oak wood and it is 120 cm long and 50 cm wide. The horse weighs 800 kg without the brothers on top. The wooden frame has three spaces and has space for 12 bearers or 'Pijnders'.\n\nEvery ten years, the selection of the four 'Heemskinderen' is difficult. The criteria are severe:\n\nIn 1807, the Ros was ridden by Pieter-Emmanuel, Pieter-Frans, Pieter-Jan and Bernard-Jozef Blomme. The horse was used to celebrate the birthday of Napoleon I and the Concordate.\n\nIn 1850 the brothers were Edmond, Désiré, Henri and Lodewijk Spanogh. The procession celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Court and the Academy of Arts. The historian David Lindanus was also commemorated and king Leopold II attended the procession.\n\nThe inauguration of the statue of Pater De Smet in 1878 entailed a new procession and the knights were Isidoor, Omer, Petrus and Frans Willems. They also celebrated the inauguration of the new lock in the Dender.\n\nWhen Polydore de Keyser, Lord Mayor of London, visited his birth town Dendermonde in 1888, the Heemskinderen were Henri, Lodewijk, Gustaaf and Alfons Pieters.\n\nIn 1899, the Ros Beiaard was ridden by Pieter, Adhemar, Lucinthe and Leo Dieltjens. They celebrated a new bridge over the Scheldt.\n\nIn 1914, the knights were Jan, Leo, Pieter and Edward De Bruyn. The celebration was the appointment of Leo Bruynincx as mayor of Dendermonde.\n\nIn 1930, Dendermonde celebrated the centenary of the Belgian independence and the Horse was ridden by Henri, Jean, Pierre and Albert Van Damme.\n\nIn 1952, Jozef, Rafaël, Pieter and Jan Bombay were the knights. The town hall existed for 500 years and this was celebrated.\n\nIn 1958, because of the World's Fair in Brussels, the brothers Emiel, Albert, Jozef and Luc Leybaert rode the Ros.\n\nIn 1975 the brothers Dirk, Wim, Boudewijn and Kris De Jonghe rode the Horse. \n\nIn 1990 the honour befell the brothers Veldeman. \n\nIn 2000 the brothers Roy, Nick, Ken and Dean Coppieters rode the Ros.\n\nIn 2010 the procession was held in May and the Van Damme brothers rode the horse.\n\nThe guild of the \"Pijnders\" originated in the 14th century and had the monopoly on loading and unloading ships and cellars with wine and beer. Today, the \"Pijnders\" are the only persons allowed to carry the \"Ros Beiaard\" in the processions.\n\nThe task of the \"Pijnders\" must not be underestimated, as they occupy a main function in the procession in carrying the horse. The movements of the horse have to be synchronized with the directions of the director. The \"Pijnders\" are divided into three groups consisting each of twelve carriers. Every group has its leader who has to set the pace and order the special movements.\n\nThe legend is told in the city hymn of Dendermonde. The hymn also refers to the rivalry with the neighbor city of Aalst who purportedly envy the Dendermonde for its horse.\n\n"}

Widely considered a groundbreaking work in sociology of education, it argues the \"correspondence principle\" explains how the internal organization of schools corresponds to the internal organisation of the capitalist workforce in its structures, norms, and values. For example, the authors assert the hierarchy system in schools reflects the structure of the labour market, with the head teacher as the managing director, pupils fall lower down in the hierarchy. Wearing uniforms and discipline are promoted among students from working class, as it would be in the workplace for lower levels employees. Education provides knowledge of how to interact in the workplace and gives direct preparation for entry into the labour market. \n\nThey also believe work casts a \"long shadow\" in education – education is used by the bourgeoisie to control the workforce. From their point of view schools reproduce existing inequalities and they reject the notion that there are equal opportunities for all. In this way they argue that education justifies and explains social inequality.\n\nThe book is now considered the key text for the Marxist theory of sociology of education.\n\nBowles and Gintis have been criticised:\n\nGottesman, Isaac (2016), \"The Critical Turn in Education: From Marxist Critique to Poststructuralist Feminism to Critical Theories of Race\" (New York: Routledge)\n\n"}
{"id": "28027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28027", "title": "Skateboarding", "text": "Skateboarding\n\nSkateboarding is an action sport which involves riding and performing tricks using a skateboard, as well as a recreational activity, an art form, a entertainment industry job, and a method of transportation. Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years. A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated $4.8 billion in annual revenue with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world. In 2016, it was announced that skateboarding will be represented at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nSince the 1970s, skateparks have been constructed specifically for use by skateboarders, Freestyle BMXers, aggressive skaters, and very recently, scooters. However, skateboarding has become controversial in areas in which the activity, although illegal, has damaged curbs, stoneworks, steps, benches, plazas and parks.\n\nThe first skateboards started with wooden boxes, or boards, with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom. Crate scooters preceded skateboards, having a wooden crate attached to the nose (front of the board), which formed rudimentary handlebars. The boxes turned into planks, similar to the skateboard decks of today. An American WAC, Betty Magnuson, reported seeing French children in the Montmartre section of Paris riding on boards with roller skate wheels attached to them in late 1944. \nSkateboarding, as we know it, was probably born sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s, when surfers in California wanted something to do when the waves were flat. This was called \"sidewalk surfing\" – a new wave of surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular. No one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. The shop owner, Bill Richard, made a deal with the Chicago Roller Skate Company to produce sets of skate wheels, which they attached to square wooden boards. Accordingly, skateboarding was originally denoted \"sidewalk surfing\" and early skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot.\nBy the 1960s a small number of surfing manufacturers in Southern California such as Jack's, Kips', Hobie, Bing's and Makaha started building skateboards that resembled small surfboards, and assembled teams to promote their products. One of the earliest Skateboard exhibitions was sponsored by Makaha's founder, Larry Stevenson, in 1963 and held at the Pier Avenue Junior High School in Hermosa Beach, California. Some of these same teams of skateboarders were also featured on a television show called \"Surf's Up\" in 1964, hosted by Stan Richards, that helped promote skateboarding as something new and fun to do.\n\nAs the popularity of skateboarding began expanding, the first skateboarding magazine, \"The Quarterly Skateboarder\" was published in 1964. John Severson, who published the magazine, wrote in his first editorial:\n\nThe magazine only lasted four issues, but resumed publication as \"Skateboarder\" in 1975. The first broadcast of an actual skateboarding competition was the 1965 National Skateboarding Championships, which were held in Anaheim, California and aired on ABC’s “Wide World of Sports. Because skateboarding was a new sport during this time, there were only two original disciplines during competitions: flatland freestyle and slalom downhill racing.\n\nOne of the earliest sponsored skateboarders, Patti McGee, was paid by Hobie and Vita Pak to travel around the country to do skateboarding exhibitions and to demonstrate skateboarding safety tips. McGee made the cover of \"Life\" magazine in 1965 and was featured on several popular television programs—\"The Mike Douglas Show\", \"What's My Line?\" and \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\"—which helped make skateboarding even more popular at the time. Some other well known surfer-style skateboarders of the time were Danny Bearer, Torger Johnson, Bruce Logan, Bill and Mark Richards, Woody Woodward, & Jim Fitzpatrick.\n\nThe growth of the sport during this period can also be seen in sales figures for Makaha, which quoted $10 million worth of board sales between 1963 and 1965 (Weyland, 2002:28). By 1966 a variety of sources began to claim that skateboarding was dangerous, resulting in shops being reluctant to sell them, and parents being reluctant to buy them. In 1966 sales had dropped significantly (ibid) and Skateboarder Magazine had stopped publication. The popularity of skateboarding dropped and remained low until the early 1970s.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Frank Nasworthy started to develop a skateboard wheel made of polyurethane, calling his company Cadillac Wheels. Prior to this new material, skateboards wheels were metal or \"clay\" wheels. The improvement in traction and performance was so immense that from the wheel's release in 1972 the popularity of skateboarding started to rise rapidly again, causing companies to invest more in product development. Nasworthy commissioned artist Jim Evans to do a series of paintings promoting Cadillac Wheels, they were featured as ads and posters in the resurrected Skateboarder magazine, and proved immensely popular in promoting the new style of skateboarding.\n\nIn the early 1970s skateparks hadn't been invented yet, so skateboarders would flock and skateboard in such urban places as The Escondido reservoir in San Diego, California. Skateboarding magazine would publish the location and Skateboarders made up nicknames for each location such as the Tea Bowl, the Fruit Bowl, Bellagio, the Rabbit Hole, Bird Bath, the Egg Bowl, Upland Pool and the Sewer Slide. Some of the development concepts in the terrain of skateparks were actually taken from the Escondido reservoir. Many companies started to manufacture trucks (axles) specially designed for skateboarding, reached in 1976 by Tracker Trucks. As the equipment became more maneuverable, the decks started to get wider, reaching widths of and over, thus giving the skateboarder even more control. A banana board is a skinny, flexible skateboard made of polypropylene with ribs on the underside for structural support. These were very popular during the mid-1970s and were available in a myriad of colors, bright yellow probably being the most memorable, hence the name.\n\nIn 1975 skateboarding had risen back in popularity enough to have one of the largest skateboarding competitions since the 1960s, the Del Mar National Championships, which is said to have had up to 500 competitors. The competition lasted two days and was sponsored by Bahne Skateboards & Cadillac Wheels. While the main event was won by freestyle spinning skate legend Russ Howell, a local skate team from Santa Monica, California, the Zephyr team, ushered in a new era of surfer style skateboarding during the competition that would have a lasting impact on skateboarding's history. With a team of 12, including skating legends such as Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Peggy Oki & Stacy Peralta, they brought a new progressive style of skateboarding to the event, based on the style of Hawaiian surfers Larry Bertlemann, Buttons Kaluhiokalani and Mark Liddell. Craig Stecyk, a photo journalist for Skateboarder Magazine, wrote about and photographed the team, along with Glen E. Friedman, and shortly afterwards ran a series on the team called the Dogtown articles, which eventually immortalized the Zephyr skateboard team. The team became known as the Z-Boys and would go on to become one of the most influential teams in skateboarding's history.\n\nSoon, skateboarding contests for cash and prizes, using a professional tier system, began to be held throughout California, such as the California Free Former World Professional Skateboard Championships, which featured Freestyle and Slalom competitions.\n\nA precursor to the extreme sport of street luge, that was sanctioned by the United States Skateboarding Association (USSA), also took place during the 1970s in Signal Hill, California. The competition was called \"The Signal Hill Skateboarding Speed Run\", with several competitors earning entries into the Guinness Book of World Records, at the time clocking speeds of over 50 mph on a skateboard. Due to technology and safety concerns at the time, when many competitors crashed during their runs, the sport did not gain popularity or support during this time.\n\nIn March 1976, Skateboard City skatepark in Port Orange, Florida and Carlsbad Skatepark in San Diego County, California would be the first two skateparks to be opened to the public, just a week apart. They were the first of some 200 skateparks that would be built through 1982. This was due in part to articles that were running in the investment journals at the time, stating that skateparks were a good investment. Notable skateboarders from the 1970s also include Ty Page, Tom Inouye, Laura Thornhill, Ellen O'Neal, Kim Cespedes, Bob Biniak, Jana Payne, Waldo Autry, Robin Logan, Bobby Piercy, Russ Howell, Ellen Berryman, Shogo Kubo, Desiree Von Essen, Henry Hester, Robin Alaway, Paul Hackett, Michelle Matta, Bruce Logan, Steve Cathey, Edie Robertson, Mike Weed, David Hackett, Gregg Ayres, Darren Ho, and Tom Sims.\n\nManufacturers started to experiment with more exotic composites and metals, like fiberglass and aluminium, but the common skateboards were made of maple plywood. The skateboarders took advantage of the improved handling of their skateboards and started inventing new tricks. Skateboarders, most notably Ty Page, Bruce Logan, Bobby Piercy, Kevin Reed, and the Z-Boys started to skate the vertical walls of swimming pools that were left empty in the 1976 California drought. This started the \"vert\" trend in skateboarding. With increased control, vert skaters could skate faster and perform more dangerous tricks, such as slash grinds and frontside/backside airs. This caused liability concerns and increased insurance costs to skatepark owners, and the development (first by Norcon, then more successfully by Rector) of improved knee pads that had a hard sliding cap and strong strapping proved to be too-little-too-late. During this era, the \"freestyle\" movement in skateboarding began to splinter off and develop into a much more specialized discipline, characterized by the development of a wide assortment of flat-ground tricks.\n\nAs a result of the \"vert\" skating movement, skate parks had to contend with high liability costs that led to many park closures. In response, vert skaters started making their own ramps, while freestyle skaters continued to evolve their flatland style. Thus, by the beginning of the 1980s, skateboarding had once again declined in popularity.\n\nThis period was fueled by skateboard companies that were run by skateboarders. The focus was initially on vert ramp skateboarding. The invention of the no-hands aerial (later known as the ollie) by Alan Gelfand in Florida in 1976, and the almost parallel development of the grabbed aerial by George Orton and Tony Alva in California, made it possible for skaters to perform airs on vertical ramps. While this wave of skateboarding was sparked by commercialized vert ramp skating, a majority of people who skateboarded during this period didn't ride vert ramps. As most people could not afford to build vert ramps, or did not have access to nearby ramps, street skating increased in popularity.\n\nFreestyle skating remained healthy throughout this period, with pioneers such as Rodney Mullen inventing many of the basic tricks that would become the foundation of modern street skating, such as the \"Impossible\" and the \"kickflip\". The influence that freestyle exerted upon street skating became apparent during the mid-1980s; however, street skating was still performed on wide vert boards with short noses, slide rails, and large soft wheels. In response to the tensions created by this confluence of skateboarding \"genres\", a rapid evolution occurred in the late 1980s to accommodate the street skater. Since few skateparks were available to skaters at this time, street skating pushed skaters to seek out shopping centers and public and private property as their \"spot\" to skate. (Public opposition, in which businesses, governments, and property owners have banned skateboarding on properties under their jurisdiction or ownership, would progressively intensify over the following decades.) By 1992, only a small fraction of skateboarders continuing to take part in a highly technical version of street skating, combined with the decline of vert skating, produced a sport that lacked the mainstream appeal to attract new skaters.\n\nSkateboarding during the 1990s became dominated by street skateboarding. Most boards are about wide and long. The wheels are made of an extremely hard polyurethane, with hardness (durometer) approximately 99A. The wheel sizes are relatively small so that the boards are lighter, and the wheels' inertia is overcome quicker, thus making tricks more manageable. Board styles have changed dramatically since the 1970s but have remained mostly alike since the mid-1990s. The contemporary shape of the skateboard is derived from the freestyle boards of the 1980s with a largely symmetrical shape and relatively narrow width. This form had become standard by the mid '90s.\n\nBy 2001 skateboarding had gained so much popularity that more people under the age of 18 rode skateboards (10.6 million) than played baseball (8.2 million), although traditional organized team sports still dominated youth programs overall. Skateboarding and skateparks began to be viewed and used in a variety of new ways to complement academic lessons in schools, including new non-traditional physical education skateboarding programs, like Skatepass and Skateistan, to encourage youth to have better attendance, self-discipline and confidence. This was also based on the healthy physical opportunities skateboarding was understood to bring participants for muscle & bone strengthening and balance, as well as the positive impacts it can have on youth in teaching them mutual respect, social networking, artistic expression and an appreciation of the environment.\n\nIn 2003 Go Skateboarding Day was founded in southern California by the International Association of Skateboard Companies to promote skateboarding throughout the world. It is celebrated annually on June 21 \"to define skateboarding as the rebellious, creative celebration of independence it continues to be.\"\nAccording to market research firm American Sports Data the number of skateboarders worldwide increased by more than 60 percent between 1999 and 2002—from 7.8 million to 12.5 million.\n\nMany cities also began implementing recreation plans and statutes during this time period, as part of their vision for local parks and communities to make public lands more available, in particular, for skateboarding, inviting skateboarders to come in off of the city streets and into organized skateboarding activity areas. By 2006 there were over 2,400 skateparks worldwide and the design of skateparks themselves had made a transition, as skaters turned designers. Many new places to skateboard designed specifically for street skaters, such as the \"Safe Spot Skate Spot\" program, first initiated by professional skateboarder Rob Dyrdek throughout many cities, allowed for the creation of smaller alternative safe skate plazas to be built at a lower cost. One of the largest locations ever built to skateboard in the world, SMP Skatepark in China, at 12,000 square meters in size, was built complete with a 5,000-seat stadium.\n\nIn 2009 Skatelab opened the Skateboarding Hall of Fame & Skateboard Museum. Nominees are chosen by the International Association of Skateboard Companies (IASC).\n\nEfforts have been taken to improve recognition of the cultural heritage as well as the positive effects of encouraging skateboarding within designated spaces. In 2015, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., hosted an event at which skateboarders accompanied by music did tricks on a ramp constructed for a festival of American culture. The event was the climax of a ten-day project that transformed a federal institution formerly off-limits to the skateboarding community into a platform for that community to show its relevance through shared cultural action in a cultural common space.\n\nBy raising £790,000, the Long Live Southbank initiative managed in 2017 to curb the destruction of a forty years old spot in London due to urban planning, a salvaging operation whose effect extends beyond skateboarding. The presence of a designated skating area within this public space keeps the space under nearly constant watch and drives homeless people away, increasing the feeling of safety in and near the space. The activity attracts artists such as photographers and film makers, as well as a significant number of tourists, which in turn drives economic activity in the neighborhood.\n\nRecently, barefoot skating has been experiencing a revival. Many skaters ride barefoot, particularly in summer and in warmer countries, such as South Africa, Australia, Spain and South America. The plastic penny board is intended to be ridden barefoot, as is the surfboard-inspired hamboard.\n\nIn the 2010s, electric skateboards became popular, along with self-balancing unicycles in a board format.\n\nWith the evolution of skateparks and ramp skating, the skateboard began to change. Early skate tricks had consisted mainly of two-dimensional freestyle manoeuvres like riding on only two wheels (\"wheelie\" or \"manual\"), spinning only on the back wheels (a \"pivot\"), high jumping over a bar and landing on the board again, also known as a \"hippie jump\", long jumping from one board to another, (often over small barrels or fearless teenagers), or slalom. Another popular trick was the Bertlemann slide, named after Larry Bertelemann's surfing manoeuvres.\n\nIn 1976, skateboarding was transformed by the invention of the ollie by Alan \"Ollie\" Gelfand. It remained largely a unique Florida trick until the summer of 1978, when Gelfand made his first visit to California. Gelfand and his revolutionary maneuvers caught the attention of the West Coast skaters and the media where it began to spread worldwide. The ollie was adapted to flat ground by Rodney Mullen in 1982. Mullen also invented the \"Magic Flip,\" which was later renamed the kickflip, as well as many other tricks including, the 360 Kickflip, which is a 360 pop shove-it and a kickflip in the same motion. The flat ground ollie allowed skateboarders to perform tricks in mid-air without any more equipment than the skateboard itself, it has formed the basis of many street skating tricks. A recent development in the world of trick skating is the 1080, which was first ever landed by Tom Schaar in 2012.\n\nSkateboarding was popularized by the 1986 skateboarding cult classic \"Thrashin'\". Directed by David Winters and starring Josh Brolin, it features appearances from many famous skaters such as Tony Alva, Tony Hawk, Christian Hosoi and Steve Caballero. \"Thrashin'\" also had a direct impact on \"Lords of Dogtown\", as Catherine Hardwicke, who directed \"Lords of Dogtown\", was hired by Winters to work on \"Thrashin\"' as a production designer where she met, worked with and befriended many famous skaters including the real Tony Alva, Tony Hawk, Christian Hosoi and Steve Caballero.\n\nThese films have helped improve the reputation of skateboarding youth, depicting individuals of this subculture as having a positive outlook on life, prone to poking harmless fun at each other, and engaging in healthy sportsman's competition. According to the film, lack of respect, egotism and hostility towards fellow skateboarders is generally frowned upon, albeit each of the characters (and as such, proxies of the \"stereotypical\" skateboarder) have a firm disrespect for authority and for rules in general. \"Gleaming the Cube\", a 1989 movie starring Christian Slater as a skateboarding teen investigating the death of his adopted Vietnamese brother, was somewhat of an iconic landmark to the skateboarding genre of the era. Many well-known skaters had cameos in the film, including Tony Hawk and Rodney Mullen, where Mullen served as Slater's stunt double.\n\nSkateboarding was, at first, tied to the culture of surfing. As skateboarding spread across the United States to places unfamiliar with surfing or surfing culture, it developed an image of its own. For example, the classic film short \"Video Days\" (1991) portrayed skateboarders as reckless rebels.\n\nCalifornia duo Jan and Dean recorded the song \"Sidewalk Surfin'\" in 1964, which is the Beach Boys song \"Catch a Wave\" with new lyrics associated with skateboarding.\n\nCertain cities still oppose the building of skate parks in their neighborhoods, for fear of increased crime and drugs in the area. The rift between the old image of skateboarding and a newer one is quite visible: magazines such as \"Thrasher\" portray skateboarding as dirty, rebellious, and still firmly tied to punk, while other publications, \"Transworld Skateboarding\" as an example, paint a more diverse and controlled picture of skateboarding. As more professional skaters use hip hop, reggae, or hard rock music accompaniment in their videos, many urban youths, hip-hop fans, reggae fans, and hard rock fans are also drawn to skateboarding, further diluting the sport's punk image.\n\nGroup spirit supposedly influences the members of this community. In presentations of this sort, showcasing of criminal tendencies is absent, and no attempt is made to tie extreme sports to any kind of illegal activity. Female based skateboarding groups also exist, such as Brujas which is based in New York City. Many women use their participation in skate crews to perform an alternative form of femininity. These female skate crews offer a safe haven for women and girls in cities, where they can skate and bond without male expectations or competition.\n\nThe increasing availability of technology is apparent within the skateboarding community. Many skateboarders record and edit videos of themselves and friends skateboarding. However, part of this culture is to not merely replicate but to innovate; emphasis is placed on finding new places and landing new tricks.\n\nSkateboarding video games have also become very popular in skateboarding culture. Some of the most popular are the \"Tony Hawk\" series and \"Skate series\" for various consoles (including hand-held) and personal computer.\n\nWhilst early skateboarders generally rode barefoot, preferring direct foot-to-board contact, and some skaters continue to do so, one of the early leading trends associated with the sub-culture of skateboarding itself, was the sticky-soled slip-on skate shoe, most popularized by Sean Penn's skateboarding character from the film Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Because early skateboarders were actually surfers trying to emulate the sport of surfing, at the time when skateboards first came out on the market, many skateboarded barefoot. But skaters often lacked traction, which led to foot injuries. This necessitated the need for a shoe that was specifically designed and marketed for skateboarding, such as the Randy \"720\", manufactured by the Randolph Rubber Company, and Vans sneakers, which eventually became cultural iconic signifiers for skateboarders during the 1970s and '80s as skateboarding became more widespread.\n\nWhile the skate shoes design afforded better connection and traction with the deck, skaterboarders themselves could often be identified when wearing the shoes, with Tony Hawk once saying, \"If you were wearing Vans shoes in 86, you were a skateboarder\" Because of its connection with skateboarding, Vans financed the legendary skateboarding documentary \"Dogtown and Z-Boys\" and was the first sneaker company to endorse a professional skateboarder Stacy Peralta. Vans has a long history of being a major sponsor of many of skateboarding's competitions and events throughout skateboarding's history as well, including the Vans Warped Tour and the Vans Triple Crown Series.\n\nAs it eventually became more apparent that skateboarding had a particular identity with a style of shoe, other brands of shoe companies began to specifically design skate shoes for functionality and style to further enhance the experience and culture of skateboarding including such brands as; Converse, Nike, DC Shoes, Globe, Adidas, Zoo York and World Industries. Many professional skateboarders are designed a pro-model skate shoe, with their name on it, once they have received a skateboarding sponsorship after becoming notable skateboarders. Some shoe companies involved with skateboarding, like Sole Technology, an American footwear company that makes the Etnies skate shoe brand, further distinguish themselves in the market by collaborating with local cities to open public Skateparks, such as the etnies skatepark in Lake Forest, California.\n\nIndividuality and a self-expressed casual style have always been cultural values for skateboarders, as uniforms and jerseys are not typically worn. This type of personal style for skateboarders is often reflected in the graphical designs illustrated on the bottom of the deck of skateboards, since its initial conception in the mid seventies, when Wes Humpston and Jim Muri first began doing design work for Dogtown Skateboards out of their garage by hand, creating the very first iconic skateboard-deck art with the design of the \"Dogtown Cross\".\n\nPrior to the mid-seventies many early skateboards were originally based upon the concept of “Sidewalk Surfing” and were tied to the surf culture, skateboards were surfboard like in appearance with little to no graphics located under the bottom of the skateboard-deck. Some of the early manufactured skateboards such as \"Roller Derby\", the \"Duraflex Surfer\" and the \"Banana board\" are characteristic. Some skateboards during that time were manufactured with company logo's or stickers across the top of the deck of the skateboard, as griptape was not initially used for construction. But as skateboarding progressed & evolved, and as artist began to design and add influence to the artwork of skateboards, designs and themes began to change.\n\nThere were several artistic skateboarding pioneers that had an influence on the culture of skateboarding during the 1980s, that transformed skateboard-deck art like Jim Phillips, whose edgy comic-book style \"Screaming Hand\", not only became the main logo for Santa Cruz Skateboards, but eventually transcended into tattoos of the same image for thousands of people and vinyl collectible figurines over the years. Artist Vernon Courtlandt Johnson is said to have used his artwork of skeletons and skulls, for Powell Peralta, during the same time that the music genres of punk rock and new wave music were beginning to mesh with the culture of skateboarding. Some other notable skateboard artists that made contribrutions to the culture of skateboarding also include Andy Jenkins, Todd Bratrud, Neil Blender, Marc McKee, Tod Swank, Mark Gonzales, Lance Mountain, Natas Kaupas and Jim Evans.\n\nOver the years skateboard-deck art has continued to influence and expand the culture of skateboarding, as many people began collecting skateboards based on their artistic value and nostalgia. Productions of limited editions with particular designs and types of collectible prints that can be hung on the wall, have been created by such famous artist as Andy Warhol and Keith Haring. Most professional skateboarders today have their own signature skateboard decks, with their favorite artistic designs printed on them using computer graphics.\n\nSkateboards, along with other small-wheeled transportation such as in-line skates and scooters, suffer a safety problem: riders may easily be thrown from small cracks and outcroppings in pavement, especially where the cracks run across the direction of travel. Hitting such an irregularity is the major cause of falls and injuries. The risk may be reduced at higher travel speeds.\n\nSevere injuries are relatively rare. Commonly, a skateboarder who falls suffers from scrapes, cuts, bruises, and sprains. Among injuries reported to a hospital, about half involve broken bones, usually the long bones in the leg or arm. One-third of skateboarders with reported injuries are very new to the sport, having started skating within one week of the injury. Although less common, involving 3.5–9 percent of reported injuries, traumatic head injuries and death are possible severe outcomes.\n\nSkating as a form of transportation exposes the skateboarder to the dangers of other traffic. Skateboarders on the street may be hit by other vehicles or may fall into vehicular traffic.\n\nSkateboarders also pose a risk to other pedestrians and traffic. If the skateboarder falls, the skateboard may roll or fly into another person. A skateboarder who collides with a person who is walking or biking may injure or, rarely, kill that person.\n\nMany jurisdictions require skateboarders to wear bicycle helmets to reduce the risk of head injuries and death. Other protective gear, such as wrist guards, also reduce injury. Some medical researchers have proposed restricting skateboarding to designated, specially designed areas, to reduce the number and severity of injuries, and to eliminate injuries caused by motor vehicles or to other pedestrians.\n\nThe use, ownership and sale of skateboards were forbidden in Norway from 1978 to 1989 because of the high number of injuries caused by boards. The ban led skateboarders to construct ramps in the forest and other secluded areas to avoid the police. There was, however, one legal skatepark in the country in Frogner Park in Oslo.\n\nThe use of skateboards solely as a form of transportation is often associated with the longboard. Depending on local laws, using skateboards as a form of transportation outside residential areas may or may not be legal. Backers cite portability, exercise, and environmental friendliness as some of the benefits of skateboarding as an alternative to automobiles.\n\nThe United States Marine Corps tested the usefulness of commercial off-the-shelf skateboards during urban combat military exercises in the late 1990s in a program called Urban Warrior '99. Their special purpose was \"for maneuvering inside buildings in order to detect tripwires and sniper fire\".\n\nTrampboarding is a variant of skateboarding that uses a board without the trucks and the wheels on a trampoline. Using the bounce of the trampoline gives height to perform a tricks, whereas in skateboarding you need to make the height by performing an ollie. Trampboarding is seen on YouTube in numerous videos.\n\nSwing boarding is the activity where a skateboard deck is suspended from a pivot point above the rider which allows the rider to swing about that pivot point. The board swings in an arc which is a similar movement to riding a half pipe. The incorporation of a harness and frame allows the rider to perform turns spins all while flying though the air.\n\nSkateboarding damages urban terrain features such as curbs, benches, and ledges when skateboarders perform \"grinds\" and other tricks on these surfaces. Private industry has responded to this problem by using skate deterrent devices, such as the Skatestopper, in efforts to prevent further damage and to reduce skateboarding on these surfaces.\n\nThe enactment of ordinances and the posting of signs stating \"Skateboarding is not allowed\" have also become common methods to discourage skateboarding in public areas in many cities, to protect pedestrians and property. In the area of street skating, tickets and arrest from police for trespassing and vandalism are not uncommon.\n\nSkateboarding has become an important problem in Freedom Plaza, a National Park within the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site in Washington, D.C. The Plaza contains copies of portions of Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's 1791 plan for the nation's capital city that have been inscribed in the park's raised marble surface.\n\nFreedom Plaza has become a popular location for skateboarding, although the activity is illegal and has resulted in police actions. A 2016 National Park Service management plan for the Historic Site states that skateboarding has damaged stonework, sculptures, walls, benches, steps, and other surfaces in some areas of the Plaza. The management plan further states that skateboarding presents a persistent law enforcement and management challenge, as popular websites advertise the Plaza's attractiveness for the activity. The plan notes that vandals have removed \"No Skateboarding\" signs and recommends the replacement of those signs.\n\nA professional skateboarder promoted on Facebook the use of governmental sites for the prohibited activity during the 2013 federal government shutdown in the United States.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "363929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=363929", "title": "Star 80", "text": "Star 80\n\nStar 80 is a 1983 American film based on, though fictionalized somewhat, \"Playboy\" model Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered by her husband Paul Snider in 1980. The film was directed by Bob Fosse, and stars Mariel Hemingway and Eric Roberts. Hugh Hefner sued the producers of the picture, stemming from his disapproval of how he was depicted in the film. In accordance with the family's wishes, Dorothy's mother is never mentioned by name in the movie, and the names of her sister and brother were altered. Other names were also changed due to legal concerns.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Vancouver, British Columbia and Los Angeles, California; the death scene was filmed in the same house in which the murder-suicide actually took place. The story is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Village Voice\" article \"Death of a Playmate\" by Teresa Carpenter; the film's title was taken from Snider's vanity license plates.\n\n\"Star 80\" was the second movie based on the murder of Stratten. It was preceded by the 1981 television film \"\" in which Jamie Lee Curtis portrayed Stratten, and Bruce Weitz portrayed Paul Snider.\n\nRoberts was widely praised for his performance, earning the Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor and a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. \"Star 80\" was the last film to be directed by Bob Fosse.\n\nIn 1980, Dorothy Stratten has been murdered while the murderer reflects on this. The film is interspersed with the murder and events leading up. Two years earlier, she was working at a Dairy Queen in her hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia when Paul Snider, a brash, narcissistic, small-time scam artist and pimp, makes her acquaintance. He charms her into letting him take her to her high-school prom. Dorothy's mother is immediately suspicious of Paul, particularly his attempts to ingratiate himself with Dorothy's younger sister. At the dance, quick-tempered Paul stabs her snide ex-boyfriend in the behind with a pocketknife. Afterwards, however, he wins over Dorothy with his attention and flattery, until finally he gets her to agree to pose nude for Polaroid photographs. He then uses the photographs to persuade a professional to create photographic portfolios of her. After cheating the first professional out of the promised fee, he uses a second professional and sends the second portfolio to \"Playboy\", after forging Dorothy's mother's signature on an age consent form. \"Playboy\" invites Dorothy to come to Los Angeles to pose for a professional photographer.\n\n\"Playboy\" founder and publisher Hugh Hefner is taken with Dorothy's beauty and innocence, which fit the Playboy criteria, making her Playmate of the Month for the issue of August 1979, offering her accommodation and giving her a job as a \"Bunny\" at an L.A. Playboy Club. Paul pressures her into marrying him, which Dorothy agrees to, mostly out of gratitude. She begins an acting career with small film and television roles and is made Playmate of the Year for 1980.\n\nPaul begins spending money they don't have, going as far as to purchase a Mercedes sports car with the vanity license plate STAR 80. He squanders more of her money on failed business ventures and is increasingly eclipsed by Dorothy's success, making him feel dejected. Paul begins inviting himself to the Playboy Mansion, with or without Dorothy, which annoys Hefner. At a party at the Mansion, Dorothy catches the eye of movie director Aram Nicholas, whom Hefner wheedles into letting her read for a part in his upcoming film. Paul is convinced that Aram is sleeping with her, and harasses her at home and work. He hires a private investigator to follow her, who tells him that Dorothy and Aram are indeed sleeping together. Paul investigates suing her in his roles as informal manager and husband but is told that he has a weak case. He then buys a shotgun.\n\nPaul begs Dorothy for one last chance, but she insists that she is going to leave him. Disregarding Aram's plea for her to not see Paul again, she agrees to one last surreptitious meeting with her estranged husband at their house, hoping to placate him with a financial settlement. He first pleads with her not to leave him, then flies into a rage, rapes her, then shoots her. The screen fades to black as another shotgun blast is heard, now on Snider himself, while a voiceover is heard from Dorothy praising \"Playboy\" for what it did for her.\n\n\n\nThe film was screened out of competition at the 34th Berlin International Film Festival. \"The Washington Post\" called it \"Bob Fosse's latest stylish stinker.\" Gene Siskel placed the film on his top-ten list of the best films of 1983, taking into account that the film was very unpleasant to watch. Roger Ebert gave the film four-out-of-four stars and deemed it an \"important movie\".\n\nAppearing with Siskel on an October 1986 edition of \"The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers\", Ebert said, to agreement from Rivers and Siskel, that Roberts \"should have been Oscar nominated.\" Ebert spoke of a \"\"Star 80\" syndrome,\" with Gary Oldman's reading of Sid Vicious in \"Sid and Nancy\" being snubbed for the same reason as Roberts' turn: \"Hollywood will not nominate an actor for portraying a creep, no matter how good the performance is.\"\n\nThe film opened in 16 theaters grossing $233,312 its opening weekend. Eventually the film grossed a total of $6,472,990 domestically with 502 theaters being its widest release. \"Star 80\" maintains an 90% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n"}

Syntactic change affects grammar in its morphological and syntactic aspects and is one of the types of change observed in language change.\n\nIf, however, one pays close attention to evolutions in the realms of phonology and morphology, it becomes evident that syntactic change can also be the result, rather than the cause, of profound shifts in the shape of a language, i.e. the effect of phonological change can trigger morphological reanalysis which can then engender changes in syntactic structures. \n\nSyntactic change is a phenomenon creating a shift in language patterns over time, subject to cyclic drift. The morphological idiosyncrasies of today are seen as the outcome of yesterday's regular syntax. For instance, in English, the past tense of the verb \"to go\" is not \"goed\" or any other form based on the base \"go\", as could be expected, but \"went\", a borrowing from the past tense of the verb \"to wend\".\n\nOver time, syntactic change is the greatest modifier of a particular language. Massive changes may occur both in syntax and vocabulary and are attributable to either creolization or relexification. Some theories of language change hypothesize that it occurs because the grammatical input children receive is ambiguous, and so they analyze the underlying grammatical construction in a different manner than previous generations did. This reanalyzed grammar, in turn, may create new ambiguities, which subsequent generations may analyze in yet another manner.\n\nIn some cases, change can happen in a cyclic manner. For example, prepositions can become reduced over time, until they are reanalyzed as case markers affixed onto the adjacent nouns. These case markers, in turn, may be lost over time, which will lead to the introduction of new prepositions.\n\nAn example of syntactic change in English can be seen in the development from the verb second (V2) word order, used before the 15th Century, to the modern word order. Just as with other Germanic languages, Old and Middle English had V2 word order. An example from Middle English is shown in (1), where \"nu\" 'now' is in first position, and the verb \"loke\" 'look' is in second position.\n\n(1) Nu loke euerich man toward himsuelen.\n\nnow look every man to himself\n\n'Now it's for every man to look to himself.' (as cited in Roberts 2007: 59)\n\nEven though V2 was lost, verb raising was maintained in the 1600s in Early Modern English. Unlike in Modern English, the verb preceded adverbs and negation, as shown in (2). This word order is still apparent in Shakespeare's writing.\n\n(2) if I gave not this accompt to you\n\n'if I didn't give this account to you' (1557: J. Cheke, Letter to Hoby; Görlach 1991: 223, as cited in Roberts 2007: 57)\n\n"}
{"id": "370701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=370701", "title": "Tie-in", "text": "Tie-in\n\nA tie-in work is a work of fiction or other product based on a media property such as a film, video game, television series, board game, web site, role-playing game or literary property. Tie-ins are authorized by the owners of the original property, and are a form of cross-promotion used primarily to generate additional income from that property and to promote its visibility.\n\nCommon tie-in products include literary works, which may be novelizations of a media property, original novels or story collections inspired by the property, or republished previously existing books, such as the novels on which a media property was based, with artwork or photographs from the property. According to publishing industry estimates, about one or two percent of the audience of a film will buy its novelization, making these relatively inexpensively produced works a commercially attractive proposition in the case of blockbuster film franchises. Although increasingly also a domain of previously established novelists, tie-in writing has the disadvantages, from the writers' point of view, of modest pay, tight deadlines and no ownership in the intellectual property created.\n\nTie-in products may also have a documentary or supplemental character, such or \"making-of\" books documenting the creation of a media property. Tie-in products also include other types of works based on the media property, such as soundtrack recordings, video games or merchandise including toys and clothing.\n\nA novelization is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, comic strip or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline.\n\nTie-in novels are often newly published editions of a novel on which a film was based, sometimes renamed to match the film's title and using promotional art created for the film. For example, when Roderick Thorp's 1979 novel \"Nothing Lasts Forever\" was adapted into the 1988 film \"Die Hard\", the novel was republished as a paperback tie-in under the \"Die Hard\" title with the film's poster on the cover.\n\nIf a film is based on a story shorter than a novel — such as a short story, novelette, or novella — a tie-in book may be published featuring the adapted story as well as other stories from the same author. For example, when Stephen King's novella \"Apt Pupil\" was adapted to film, the book originally featuring the story — \"Different Seasons\" — was republished as \"Apt Pupil: A Novella in Different Seasons\". Similarly, tie-in novels were published to promote the films \"Minority Report\" and \"Paycheck\", featuring the original \"Minority Report\" and \"Paycheck\" short stories, both written by Philip K. Dick.\n\nTie-in novels may also continue the story told in the original property, such as the many novels published as part of the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe set before or after the events of the original \"Star Wars\" film trilogy. In 2015, the \"New York Times\" noted the flourishing market for TV series tie-in novels, coinciding with the increasing cultural significance of quality television series. The increasing number of previously established novelists taking on tie-in works has also been credited with these works gaining a \"patina of respectability\" after having previously been disregarded in literary circles as derivative and mere merchandise.\n\nSome video games are tie-in licences for films, television shows or books.\n\nVideo game movie tie-ins are expensive for a game developer to license, and the game designers have to work within constraints imposed by the film studio, under pressure to finish the game in time for the film's release. The aim for the publishers is to increase hype and revenue as the two industries effectively market one another's releases.\n\nMovie license video games have a reputation for being poor quality. For example, \"Amiga Power\" awarding Psygnosis's three movie licenses (\"Dracula\", \"Cliffhanger\" and \"Last Action Hero\", all reviewed in June 1994) 36% \"in total\"; that magazine being cynical towards licensed games in general, with \"The Blues Brothers\" being one of few exceptions. One of the first movie tie-in games, Atari's \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982) was deemed so bad, it was cited as one cause of the video game industry crash. Such poor quality is often due to game developers forced to rush the product in order to meet the movie's release date, or due to issues with adapting the original work's plot into an interactive form, such as in the case of the games based on the last two films of the \"Harry Potter\" film series, where one reviewer criticised some of the game's missions and side-quests as being unrelated to the film's storyline.\n\nVideo tie-in licences for novels tend to be adventure games. \"The Hobbit (1982)\" and \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" are text adventures, whilst \"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\" (1995) is a point-and-click adventure and \"Neuromancer\" (1988) is a graphic adventure. Action games based on novels are less common (\"William Shatner's TekWar\" (1995), a first-person shooter). Novel tie-ins were published less frequently after the 1990s, with developers only taking risks with stories that had already been licensed for movies.\n\nTie-ins are considered an important part of the revenue-stream for any major media release, and planning, and licensing for such works often begins at the very earliest stages of creating such a property. Tie-ins provide both an important way of generating additional income from a property, and a way of satisfying the desires of fans who enthusiastically support a popular media property.\n\nThe lineage of tie-in works can be quite convoluted. For example, a novelization might be done of a video game, which was based on a television show, based on a movie, based on a comic book which was the original media property. In several cases, a novelization has been released based on a movie which was in turn adapted from an original novel. In such cases, it is not uncommon to see the novelization and a movie release of the original novel side-by-side on the same shelf.\n\nThese tie-ins can be considered as forms of \"free advertising\", as they create more exposure for the media property. Tie-ins need not have a direct association with the property. For example, a particular pizza company can offer coupons that are associated with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, but that specific pizza company itself does not necessarily have to appear in the movies. By this association, however, the pizza company is exposed to a bigger audience. If a media property does well, the tie-ins gain that positive exposure as well.\n\nSome early examples of TV tie-in books are \"Leave It to Beaver\" (1960), \"Here's Beaver!\" (1961), and \"Beaver and Wally\" (1961) by Beverly Cleary and \"Star Trek\" (1967) by James Blish.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2753985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2753985", "title": "Totonacan languages", "text": "Totonacan languages\n\nThe Totonacan languages (also known as Totonac–Tepehua languages) are a family of closely related languages spoken by approximately 290,000 Totonac (approx. 280,000) and Tepehua (approx. 10,000) people in the states of Veracruz, Puebla, and Hidalgo in Mexico. At the time of the Spanish conquest Totonacan languages were spoken all along the gulf coast of Mexico . During the colonial period Totonacan languages were occasionally written and at least one grammar was produced . In the 20th century the number of speakers of most varieties have dwindled as indigenous identity increasingly became stigmatized encouraging speakers to adopt Spanish as their main language .\n\nThe Totonacan languages have only recently been compared to other families on the basis of historical-comparative linguistics, though they share numerous areal features with other languages of the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area, such as the Mayan languages and Nahuatl. Recent work suggests a possible genetic link to the Mixe–Zoque language family , although this has yet to be firmly established.\n\nThe family is divided into two branches, Totonac and Tepehua. Of the two, Tepehua is generally considered to consist of three languages—Pisaflores, Huehuetla, and Tlachichilco—while the Totonac branch is considerably more diverse. divides Totonac into four divisions, based on :\n\n\n\"Ethnologue\" currently recognizes 12 languages in the Totonacan family, three Tepehua languages and nine Totonac:\n\nThis classification is the basis of the latest version of the ISO language codes for Totonacan, although some of these classifications are disputed.\n\nThe Mexican Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI) recognizes 10 distinct languages or \"linguistic variants\" in the family, 3 Tepehua and 7 Totonac :\n\nCoyutla Totonac is grouped with South Central Totonac by INALI while Tecpatlán Totonac is included in the North Central Totonac group. Other recent attempts at classification have suggested that some of these divisions, particularly North Central, Costal, and South Central, and are far too broad and include varieties that might also be classified as separate languages (; ; ).\n\nA further drawback of the Ethnologue and INALI classifications is the lack of lower-level subgroups beyond the two-way division into Totonac and Tepehua. In the Totonac branch of the family, Misantla is the most distinctive, and the remaining languages form a more closely related group . Divisions amongst the latter group, which might be referred to as \"Central Totonac,\" are unclear, though most researchers agree that there is at least a three-way division between Northern, Southern/Sierra, and Lowland/Coastal varieties (; ; ). Recent efforts at reconstruction and evidence from lexical similarity further suggest that Southern/Sierra and Lowland group together against Northern , although this is still uncertain, pending more exhaustive investigation. The most recent proposal for the family is as follows (; ):\n\nLexical comparison also suggests that, for Tepehua, Pisaflores and Huehuetla may be more closely related to each other than either is to Tlalchichilco .\n\nThere is some variation is the sound systems of the different varieties of Totonac and Tepehua, but the following phoneme inventory can be considered a typical Totonacan inventory .\n\nThis consonant inventory is essentially equivalent to that reconstructed for proto-Totonacan by , with the exception of the two back fricatives, /x/ and /h/. Most modern languages phonemically have only one of these, but show some allomorphic variation between the two, with one or the other being considered basic. However, Coatepec Totonac is reported to have both phonemes , and more recent reconstructions of the proto-Totonacan consonant inventory have proposed that both were present in that language (; ). The glottal stop is a marginal phoneme in most of the languages and is posited primarily for morphological reasons. The phonological system is fairly typical of Mesoamerica.\n\nMost Totonacan languages have a three-vowel system with each quality making distinctions of length and laryngealization. The following is the \"typical\" Totonacan vocalic inventory.\n\nTepehua has lost the phonemic laryngealization of vowels and has ejective stops where Totonac has creaky vowels preceded by stops . Some Totonac languages have five-vowel systems, having developed /e/ and /o/ phonemes, whereas in others /e/ and /o/ are clearly allomorphs of /i/ and /u/, respectively, conditioned by proximity to uvular stops or fricatives.\n\nFrom a typological perspective, the Totonac–Tepehua family presents a fairly consistent profile, and exhibits many features of the Mesoamerican areal type, such as a preference for verb-initial order, head-marking, and extensive use of body part morphemes in metaphorical and locative constructions . The Totonacan languages are highly agglutinative and polysynthetic with nominative/accusative alignment and a flexible constituent order governed by information structure. Syntactic relations between the verb and its arguments are marked by agreement with the subject and one or sometimes two objects. There is no morphological case on nouns and many languages in the family lack prepositions, making use instead of a rich system of causatives, applicatives, and prefixes for body parts and parts of objects. Possession is marked on the possessed noun, the head of the NP. Otherwise, nouns are uninflected, number being an optional category and grammatical gender being absent from the languages. Numerals quantifying nouns bear classificatory prefixes, something that is unusual cross-linguistically as affixal classifiers tend heavily to be suffixes . Totonacan languages are also known for their use of sound symbolism.\n\nTotonacan languages have a wide assortment of morphemes for increasing the valency of a verb.\n\nAll Totonacan languages have at least one causative morpheme, a prefix \"ma:-\" :\n\nIn many of the languages, the causative prefix is regularly or obligatorily associated with a suffix:\nIn some languages like Upper Necaxa, the suffix is analyzed as part of the causative morpheme , but in others it is treated as a separate transitivizer .\n\nOne of the most frequently used valency-increasing affixes in the Totonacan languages is the dative or benefactive suffix :\n\nAll the languages of the family have a comitative construction in which both an actor and a co-actor of a verb are specified . For instance, in Huehuetla Tepehua a verb such as \"tamakahuːn\" 'stay, be in a place' is intransitive but can take a comitative prefix to form a verb \"ta̰ːtamakahuːn\" meaning 'stay with someone', someone being the co-actor:\n\nSimilarly, the Papantla Totonac verb \"muxuː\" ‘bury something’ is transitive but becomes ditransitive when it takes the comitative prefix:\n\nThe third applicative prefix that is shared across the family is analyzed in most of the languages as an instrumental applicative and is used to add an object used as an instrument or a means to a clause:\nIn some of the languages, the instrumental can also be used for the expression of motives:\n\nAs seen in the last example, this prefix is \"ɬi-\" in Tepehua languages rather than \"liː-\" as it is in Totonac, and in Tlachichilco and Huehuetla it is analyzed as a directional (\"DIR\") rather than an instrumental. The prefix seems to be less frequent in Tepehua than in Totonac.\n\nThe Totonacan languages exhibit a phenomenon similar to noun incorporation whereby special prefixing combining forms of body-parts may be added to verbs , . When these prefixes are added, they generally serve to delimit the verb's locus of affect; that is, they indicate which part of the subject or object is affected by the action.\nThe prefixes can also be used to specify the shape of an affected object:\nIt is worthwhile to note that the prefixation does not decrease the valency of the verb, differentiating this process from true noun incorporation as the term is usually understood .\n\nAnother important role that bodypart prefixes play in Totonacan languages is in the formulation of expressions of the spatial location of objects, which combine a part-prefix with one of four posture verbs (words for ’sit’, ‘stand’, ‘lie’, and ‘be high’):\n\nThese constructions alternate with expressions using the independent (full) form of the part as a preposition-like element:\nIn the last sentence, the independent form of \"a̰kpuː-\" ‘crown’ is formed by combining this prefix with a base \"-n\" which is sometimes (as here) analyzed as a nominalizing suffix. Because words for body parts are inflected for possession, \"a̰kpuːn\" ‘crown’ has a third-person singular possessive prefix, linking it to \"mesa\" ‘table’, the object on whose crown the book is located (see the section below on Possessive constructions).\n\nPossessive constructions in Totonacan languages are marked on the possessed noun rather than on the possessor noun:\n\nThe person of the possessor is indicated by a prefix and the number of the possessor by a suffix, as shown by the follow paradigm from Upper Necaxa :\nIn several of the languages, kinship terms and words referring to parts of the body and objects are inherently possessed—that is, they are obligatorily marked for a possessor. When an inherently possessed noun is used in a generic expression, a special indefinite possessor prefix (\"ša-\" in most of the languages that have it) is used—e.g. Upper Necaxa \"šapúškṵ\" ‘an elder brother/elders brothers in general’ .\n\nNumerals in Totonacan languages are bound roots that require a classificatory prefix which changes based on the type, shape or measure of object being counted. This is illustrated for one of the languages Upper Necaxa Totonac in the table below :\n\nIn total, Upper Necaxa has around 30 classificatory prefixes .\n\nThe following table compares the numeral bases of six Totonacan languages.\n\nA prominent feature of Totonacan languages is the presence of sound symbolism (see ; ; ; ; ; ; ). The most common (but by no means only) sound-symbolic pattern in Totonacan involves fricative alterations, typically /s/ ~ /š/ ~ /ɬ/ and occasionally /ts/ ~ /č/ ~ /š/ correlated either with increasingly more energetic or forceful action or with the size of an event participant, as in the following examples from Upper Necaxa Totonac :\nComparative as well as language-internal evidence suggests that the pattern of consonantal alternations may have their origins in affixes indicating grade—\"s-\" ‘diminutive‘, \"š-\" ‘medium’, \"ɬ-\" ‘augmentative’) (see ; ; ). In general, the productivity of the sound-symbolic alternations is highly variable within and across languages of the family, and many languages preserve for a given stem only one of a set of two or three alternates that can be reconstructed for proto-Totonacan .\n\nTotonacan-language programming is carried by the CDI's radio station XECTZ-AM, broadcasting from Cuetzalan, Puebla.\n\n"}
{"id": "45413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45413", "title": "Tribe", "text": "Tribe\n\nIn anthropology, a tribe is a human social group. Exact definitions of what constitutes a tribe vary among anthropologists, and the term is itself considered controversial in academic circles in part due to its association with colonialism. In general use, the term may refer to people perceived by a population to be primitive and may have negative connotations. The concept is often contrasted with other social groups concepts, such as nations, states, and forms of kinship.\n\nIn some places, such as India and North America, tribes are polities that have been granted legal recognition and limited autonomy by the national or federal government.\n\nThe word tribe first occurs in English in 12th-century Middle English-literature, in reference to the twelve tribes of Israel. The Middle English word is derived from Old French \"tribu\" and, in turn, from Latin \"tribus\" (plural \"tribūs\"), in reference to a supposed tripartite division of the original Roman state along ethnic lines, into \"tribūs\" known as the \"Ramnes\" (or \"Ramnenses\"), \"Tities\" (or \"Titienses\"), and \"Luceres\", corresponding, according to Marcus Terentius Varro, to the Latins, Sabines and Etruscans respectively. The \"Ramnes\" were named after Romulus, leader of the Latins, \"Tities\" after Titus Tatius, leader of the Sabines, and \"Luceres\" after Lucumo, leader of an Etruscan army that had assisted the Latins. In 242–240 BC, the Tribal Assembly (\"comitia tributa\") in the Roman Republic included 35 tribes (four \"urban tribes\" and 31 \"rural tribes\"). According to Livy, the three \"tribes\" were squadrons of cavalry, rather than ethnic divisions.\n\nThe term's ultimate etymology is uncertain, perhaps from the Proto-Indo-European roots \"tri-\" (\"three\") and \"bhew\" (\"to be\"). The classicist Gregory Nagy says, citing the linguist Émile Benveniste, that the Umbrian \"trifu\" (equivalent of the Latin \"tribus\") is apparently derived from a combination of \"*tri-\" and \"*bhu-\", where the second element is cognate with the Greek root \"phúō\" φύω “to bring forth” and the Greek \"phulē\" φυλή \"clan, race, people\" (plural \"phylai\" φυλαί). The Greek \"polis\" (\"state\" or \"city\") was, like the Roman state, divided into three \"phylai\".\n\nIn Europe during the late medieval era, the Bible was written mostly in New Latin and instead of \"tribus\" the word \"phyle\" was used, derived from the Greek \"phulē\". In the historical sense, \"tribe\", \"race\" and \"clan\" have often been used interchangeably.\n\nThe term and concept of a \"tribe\" is controversial among anthropologists and other academics active in the social sciences. The term \"tribe\" was in common use in the field of anthropology until the late 1950s and 1960s, during which time scholars began to reassess its utility. In 1970, anthropologist J. Clyde Mitchell writes:\nWriting in 2013, scholar Matthew Ortoleva notes that \"like the word \"Indian\", \"[t]ribe\" is a word that has connotations of colonialism.\"\n\nConsiderable debate has accompanied efforts to define and characterize tribes. When scholars use the term, they may perceive differences between pre-state tribes and contemporary tribes; there is also general controversy over cultural evolution and colonialism. In the popular imagination, tribes reflect a way of life that predates, and is more natural than that in modern states. Tribes also privilege primordial social ties and are clearly bounded, homogeneous, parochial, and stable. Tribes are an organization among families (including clans and lineages), which generates a social and ideological basis for solidarity that is in some way more limited than that of an \"ethnic group\" or of a \"nation\". Anthropological and ethnohistorical research has challenged all of these notions.\n\nAnthropologist Elman Service presented a system of classification for societies in all human cultures, based on the evolution of social inequality and the role of the state. This system of classification contains four categories:\n\n\nIn his 1975 study, \"The Notion of the Tribe\", anthropologist Morton H. Fried provided numerous examples of tribes that encompassed members who spoke different languages and practiced different rituals, or who shared languages and rituals with members of other tribes. Similarly, he provided examples of tribes in which people followed different political leaders, or followed the same leaders as members of other tribes. He concluded that tribes in general are characterized by fluid boundaries and heterogeneity, are not parochial, and are dynamic.\nFried proposed that most contemporary tribes do not have their origin in pre-state tribes, but rather in pre-state bands. Such \"secondary\" tribes, he suggested, developed as modern products of state expansion. Bands comprise small, mobile, and fluid social formations with weak leadership. They do not generate surpluses, pay no taxes, and support no standing army. Fried argued that secondary tribes develop in one of two ways. First, states could set them up as means to extend administrative and economic influence in their hinterland, where direct political control costs too much. States would encourage (or require) people on their frontiers to form more clearly bounded and centralized polities, because such polities could begin producing surpluses and taxes, and would have a leadership responsive to the needs of neighboring states (the so-called \"scheduled\" tribes of the United States or of British India provide good examples of this). Second, bands could form \"secondary\" tribes as a means to defend against state expansion. Members of bands would form more clearly bounded and centralized polities, because such polities could begin producing surpluses that could support a standing army that could fight against states, and they would have a leadership that could co-ordinate economic production and military activities.\n\nArchaeologists continue to explore the development of pre-state tribes. Current research suggests that tribal structures constituted one type of adaptation to situations providing plentiful yet unpredictable resources. Such structures proved flexible enough to coordinate production and distribution of food in times of scarcity, without limiting or constraining people during times of surplus.\n\n"}

It is on the north end of the island and has controlled-access gates.\n\nWild Dunes was developed in 1972.\n\nWild Dunes has two famous golf courses on it: the Wild Dunes Links Course, and the Harbor Course, both designed by Tom Fazio. It also has a nationally ranked tennis complex with 17 clay courts, and an award-winning family recreation program.\n\nIn early 2008, large-scale beach erosion led to the depletion of the beachfront area of Wild Dunes. The beachfront was greatly reduced, waterfront buildings received structural damage, and the 18th hole of the Links Golf Course was washed out. After a lengthy process, at the end of the Summer of 2008 the City of Isle of Palms finished repairing the beach. Approximately of sand was pumped in from offshore, leading to the restoration of over 150 yards of beachfront. Also, the 18th hole of the Links Course has been repaired, but is now a Par 3 instead of the old Par 5. Wild Dunes worked with the golf course designer Tom Fazio to restore the course's final hole to the Par 5 it used to be, a task that was completed in 2009.\n\n"}
