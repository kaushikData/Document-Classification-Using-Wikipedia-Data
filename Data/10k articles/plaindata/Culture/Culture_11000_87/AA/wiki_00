{"id": "32676152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32676152", "title": "Academic visibility", "text": "Academic visibility\n\nAcademic visibility relates to the dissemination, accessibility, and recognition of scholarship produced by college faculty, especially in terms of promotion and tenure criteria and academic rank. Traditionally, \"visibility\" was a function of printed output like books, book chapters, and peer-reviewed journal articles primarily available in academic libraries. This is rapidly changing with the exponential increase in electronic, online indexing of these materials. Scholarly recognition and reputation increases as visibility increases from works being frequently referred to as authoritative.\n\nFor college professors, the promotion and tenure process takes into account the achievements and reputation of their scholarly activities. Having a national (and international) reputation means that their academic publishing has been disseminated widely and is frequently cited by other scholars. Promotion and tenure typically requires demonstrating a strong record of published research, instruction, and professional/administrative service, with the strongest emphasis on research in many universities.\n\nTenure-track faculty start in the academic rank of Assistant Professor. They need to establish a strong scholarly reputation prior to being promoted to Associate Professor. Among other things, this involves publishing working in respected outlets, presenting their work at academic or professional conferences, and being of service to their profession and/or community. Traditionally, promotion and tenure decisions have been strongly influenced by a professor's scholarly work - which includes books, book chapters, and refereed journal articles. Books, book chapters, and journal articles have been the easiest types of scholarly output to assess because they existed in hard-copy and were mostly peer-reviewed, professionally published, and indexed by libraries. These, however, only represent one of three categories used to assess achievements and reputation with the others being teaching and service. Not being promoted upon tenure review frequently results in dismissal (i.e., termination).\n\nInformation and communications technologies are rapidly changing how academic achievements and reputation can be assessed. The internet is becoming an all-purpose source for scholarship. \"Web mentions\" and URL citations are an analog to journal citations for scholarly work appearing or referenced on web sites or blogs. Like article citations, web citations can represent the noteworthiness of a scholar's contributions. And like frequent academic journal citations, a wide range of web mentions adds to an academic's reputation and prestige.\n\nThe advantage of assessing a wider range of academic output conveys the breadth and reach takes a more holistic view of an academic's body of work, or figuratively, an overall \"academic footprint\". An assessment of the academic footprint and/or visibility approaches that of the actual tenure review process because it can include nearly all of the activities undertaken by a faculty member, including but not limited to: dissertation, book reviews, conference proceedings, conference presentations, research reports, funded grants, and teaching activities.\n\nWebometrics can be used to assess an academic's visibility based on \"web mentions\" or references to academic work by web pages. Metrics include number of URLs, Google Pagerank, and number of sources linking to associated pages (backlinks).\n\n"}

{"id": "44319037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44319037", "title": "Alois Miedl", "text": "Alois Miedl\n\nAlois Miedl (3 March 1903 - 4 January 1990) was a naturalized Dutch art dealer, originally a German Nazi banker, born in Munich, who had moved to and was mainly active in the Netherlands, involved with the sales of properties stolen from Jews who had fled or had been deported.\n\nAlois Miedl was born in 1903 in Munich as son to Alois Miedl and Maria Streicher. His father owned a dairy farm. Alois Miedl married Theodore \"Dorie\" Fleischer, a Jewish girl with whom he had two children, Ruth Marie (born 1925) and Hanns Alois (born 1933). From 1920 to 1924, Alois worked at the bank of Heinrich and Hugo Marx in Munich, and from 1924 to 1929 at the bank Witzig & Co., also in Munich. In 1930 he became a director of the Berlin Schantung-Handelaktiengeselschaft, and in 1932 he moved to the Netherlands as director of Veland, a subsidiary of the Berlin company. At the same time, he was director of a number of companies in Germany and elsewhere. He was an avid mountaineer. He moved to the Netherlands in 1932, because of his new function there, but probably also because he feared for the security of his Jewish wife in Germany.\n\nBefore the war, the Miedls frequented the richest Jewish families in Amsterdam, where they had moved to from Munich in 1932. At the same time, he was a friend of many prominent Nazi leaders, including Hermann Göring and Ferdinand aus der Fünten, the head of the Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Amsterdam. He even stayed several times at Hitler's residence Berghof in Berchtesgaden. After the occupation of the Netherlands had started, Dorie was declared a Honorary Aryan. The Miedls organized galas in their home to celebrate Hitler's birthday, with Miedl wearing an SS-uniform and prominent members of the Dutch Gestapo as guests.\n\nRight from the start of the war, Miedl tried to acquire art works from Jewish owners, threatening them that they had the choice between selling to him at severely reduced prices, or being looted by the Gestapo. Many Jews, not seeing any way out, agreed to the blackmail. Miedl not only dealt in art, but also got his hands on other valuables in this way. He also offered protection to some Jews as a form of business transaction, thereby saving about a dozen Jews from deportation and near-certain death. But in other cases, he had no qualms about letting Jewish associates being deported. For example, his two Jewish accountants were transferred to Theresienstadt in 1943 and died there.\n\nAfter famous collector Jacques Goudstikker had died when fleeing the Netherlands, Miedl bought his collection of 1300 old master paintings and other artworks illegally, and sold 600 of the paintings to Hermann Göring. Alois Miedl acquired for himself the Goudstikker estate Oostermeer in Ouderkerk a/d Amstel, where he would live in splendour, and the gallery including Nijenrode Castle . All of it was bought for 2 million guilders, which was only a fraction of the actual value at the time. Among the pictures sold to Göring were \"Two Philosophers\" by Rembrandt and works by Salomon van Ruysdael, Hans Memling, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Gerard ter Borch, Jacopo del Casentino and Frans Hals. The works kept by Miedl included Rembrandt's \"Young man with a sword\", which he sold in 1944 in Germany to pay off a loan.\n\nHe used the Goudstikker name and fame to do business. In return he protected the Jewish mother of Goudstikker, who hadn't fled the Netherlands with the rest of the family and now faced the same risks as all Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe. Thanks to the deal, she survived the war and acquired the company again afterwards. According to former Dutch resistance member Joseph Piller, who was instructed by the Dutch Army immediately after the war to research the role of the Goudstikker gallery during the war, Miedl used the company as a front to sell looted art to Nazis, and used the profits for the Abwehr.\n\nFrom the collection of the Wolf brothers, who had fled the Netherlands, he bought multiple paintings for the Göring collection, including a Vincent Van Gogh, a Tintoretto, and a Joos van Cleve. For his own, he acquired the bank and the cinema previously owned by the brothers. From Hans Tietje, who was married to a Jewish wife, he bought a \"Madonna and Child\" by Lucas Cranach the Elder. From the Jew Fritz Gutmann, he bought three sixteenth-century silver cups. Other collections he bought include the Proehl collection (which included a \"Venus\" by Cranach) and the Mannheimer collection.\n\nAnother Jewish art collector who dealt with Miedl was Nathan Katz. His heirs claimed that the artworks were sold under duress, similar to that of many other clients of Miedl, but this was disputed by the Dutch government, which had recovered many of the paintings from the Nazis after the war. Katz and Miedl had been friends, and no sufficient evidence could be produced to show that the sale had not been voluntary.\n\nMiedl also dealt with non-Jewish collectors. He bought a collection of 19 old master paintings from German banker Franz Koenigs in 1941: 9 Rubens paintings from it were sold by Miedl to Göring. from the Belgian art collector Émile Renders, he bought 12 old Flemish works, including works attributed to Hans Memling and to Rogier Van der Weyden. 6 Works were sold to Göring, the other half was kept by Miedl.\n\nIn 1942, Miedl bought \"Christ with the Adulteress\", a painting supposedly by Johannes Vermeer but actually a forgery by Han van Meegeren, for 1.65 million Dutch guilders. He then sold it to Hermann Göring in exchange for an undisclosed sum of money and 150 other looted paintings, 54 of them originally from the Goudstikker collection, totalling about 2 million guilders worth.\n\nMiedl was also involved in other business and speculation. His most ambitious plan was to buy, according to the source, either the coast of Labrador or Anticosti Island, or both to have a constant supply of wood for Germany, or alternatively as a foothold to spy on Canada or the United States. It failed when Canada disallowed the sale for fear of espionage. He also was said to have attempted to buy a gold mine in the Dutch East Indies, and was reputedly involved with diamond smuggling.\n\nIn July 1944, Miedl fled to Francoist Spain via Switzerland. He had in February 1944 sent most of his art collection to the country, together with his wife who he felt was no longer safe in the Netherlands despite Göring's protection. It has also been speculated, based on claims made by SS officer Otto Ohlendorf, that he transferred part of Göring's collection to Spain as well, as a safeguard against the fall of the Third Reich. Twenty two paintings he had smuggled out of the Netherlands, including thirteen paintings of the Goudstikker collection, were confiscated in the port of Bilbao. Although they were reclaimed by the Netherlands, it is unclear what happened to them. Miedl remained in Spain and negotiated a deal with the Dutch authorities, who confiscated valuables worth about 1.8 million guilders, and some 150 pictures left by Miedl in the Netherlands when he fled. Other paintings acquired by Miedl were kept in banks in Berlin, and in Switzerland. The works in Switzerland, which included 4 paintings by Paul Cézanne and Van Gogh's \"Self portrait with bandaged ear\", all previously owned by French art dealer and Jew Paul Rosenberg, were confiscated in 1945. The works in Germany were also recovered and claimed by the Dutch government.\n\nNo further trial or repayments were asked, meaning that Miedl was free to keep the rest of his amassed wealth and continue to do business throughout the world. He was estimated to have smuggled some 200 paintings to Spain that were never recovered. He tried to sell a Goya to the Prado. He planned an auction of the others, and had prepared a catalogue, listing works by Cranach, Rubens, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Anthony Van Dyck, Cézanne, Titian and El Greco. He sold a painting he had bought during the war from Émile Renders, a copy of a wing of the \"Braque Triptych\" by Rogier Van der Weyden, perhaps made by Hans Memling, to a private collector in Norway in 1966. He died in 1990.\n"}

{"id": "9464769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9464769", "title": "Brusselization", "text": "Brusselization\n\nIn urban planning, Brusselization (UK and US) or Brusselisation (UK variant) (, ) is \"the indiscriminate and careless introduction of modern high-rise buildings into gentrified neighbourhoods\" and has become a byword for \"haphazard urban development and redevelopment\".\n\nThe notion applies to anywhere whose development follows the pattern of the uncontrolled development of Brussels in the 1960s and 1970s, that resulted from a lack of zoning regulations and the city authorities' laissez-faire approach to city planning.\n\nThe original Brusselization was the type of urban regeneration performed by the city of Brussels in connection with Expo 58. In order to prepare the city for Expo 58, buildings were torn down without regard either to their architectural or historical importance, high-capacity square office/apartment buildings were built, boulevards were created and tunnels dug. Among the most controversial was the large-scale demolition of townhouses for development of the high-rise business district in the Northern Quarter. All of these changes were designed to quickly increase the number of people working and living in the city and improve transportation.\n\nFurther radical changes resulted from Brussels's role as the center of the EU and NATO, beginning with the construction of the European Commission headquarters in 1959. The introduction of a high-speed rail network in the 1990s was the latest excuse to speculate on multiple rows of properties for modern office/hotel redevelopment, which led to the razing of neighborhood blocks near Brussels-South railway station.\n\nThese changes caused outcry amongst the citizens of Brussels and by environmentalist and preservationist organizations. The demolition of Victor Horta's Art Nouveau \"\" in 1965 was one focus of such protests, (see photograph on right for what now stands on its site), as was the construction of the IBM Tower in 1978.\n\nMany architects protested, and it was the architectural world that coined the name Brusselization for what was happening to Brussels. Architects such as and formulated an anti-capitalist urban planning theory, as a rejection of the rampant modernism that they saw overtaking Brussels.\n\nThe 1950s was not the first time that the city had been radically altered by major redevelopment. Two prior sweeping changes to the urban fabric of Brussels were the straight-lined central avenues modeled after Paris, which were created by covering and diverting the Senne river, and the North–South railway connection, which took around 40 years to finish (1911–52) and which had left swaths of the city center filled with debris and craters for decades. Another precedent is the erecting of the Palace of Justice, the largest building in the world constructed in the 1800s. André de Vries asserts that the penchant for heavy-handedness can be traced back to the reign of Leopold II in the late 19th century, and possibly even all the way back to the bombardment of the city by Louis XIV's troops in 1695. \"There is barely one building still standing\", he says, \"from before 1695, with the exception of some churches and the Town Hall\".\n\nLeopold II sought to give Brussels the image of a grand capital city of an imperial/colonial power. By the middle 20th century there was a tacit alliance between urban development entrepreneurs and local government, with a modernist agenda and with their sights set firmly on large-scale development projects. The citizens of Brussels were largely left out of the process.\n\nIn the early 1990s laws were introduced restricting the demolition of buildings that were deemed to have architectural or historical significance; and in 1999 the city authorities' urban development plan explicitly declared high-rise buildings to be architecturally incompatible with the existing aesthetics of the city centre. This led to the rise of what was termed \" — the destruction of the whole interior of a historic building while preserving its historic façade.\n\nThese laws were the Town Planning Act 1991, which gave local authorities the powers to refuse demolition requests on the grounds of historical, aesthetic, or cultural significance, and to designate architectural heritage zones; and the Heritage Conservation Act of 1993, which gave the government of the Brussels Capital Region the power to designate buildings to be protected for historic reasons. However, this system had its deficiencies. Whilst the Capital Region government could designate historic buildings, it was the nineteen municipal authorities within it that were responsible for demolition permits. Not until the introduction of a \" system was this internecine conflict resolved.\n\n\n\n"}

It was co-founded by DJ/promoter Scott Henry and DJ/promoter and DC music store (Music Now) owner Lieven DeGeyndt at the East Side Club and then relaunched in October 1995 at the now demolished Nation, formerly the Capital Ballroom. At its peak it was one of the largest dance parties on the East Coast and voted \"Best Party\" four years in a row by then electronic dance music culture magazine URB (magazine). Buzz attracted the world's top electronic dance music artists to Washington, DC.\n\nBuzz first began in 1993 at the Eastside Club in DC. Early line-ups included prominent east coast DJs like Moby, Little Louie Vega, Frankie Bones, and Josh Wink. The Eastside club events ran in conjunction with a party on the lower level of the club called, Serve, which featured mostly house music. Buzz went through several other venues including a location next to The Ritz and a temporary underground venue off of New York avenue in DC before relaunching at the Capital Ballroom in October 1995. The Capital Ballroom changed management in 1999 and became known as Nation (nightclub).\n\nBuzz was shut down temporarily in 1999 after Fox 5 WTTG reporter Elisabeth Leamy broadcast murky hidden camera footage purportedly showing drug use at the party during sweeps week.

However, the “witch-hunt” was not over.\n\"In an unprecedented move, the United States Military and the DC Police Department joined forces to share information and resources targeting both the Friday night event Buzz and the nightclub Nation.

{"id": "11885169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11885169", "title": "Career counseling", "text": "Career counseling\n\nCareer counseling and career guidance are similar in nature to other types of counseling (e.g. marriage or clinical counseling). What unites all types of professional counseling is the role of practitioners, who combine giving advice on their topic of expertise with counseling techniques that support clients in making complex decisions and facing difficult situations. The focus of career counseling is generally on issues such as career exploration, career change, personal career development and other career related issues. \n\nThere is no agreed definition of career counseling worldwide, mainly due to conceptual, cultural and linguistic differences. This even affects the most central term \"counseling\" (or: \"counselling\" in British English) which is often substituted with the word \"guidance\" as in \"career guidance\". For example, in the UK, \"career counseling\" would usually be referred to as \"careers advice\" or \"guidance\". Due to the widespread reference to both \"career guidance\" and \"career counseling\" among policy-makers, academics and practitioners around the world, references to \"career guidance and counselling\" are becoming common.\nCareer counseling or career guidance includes a wide variety of professional activities which help people deal with career-related challenges. Career counselors work with adolescents seeking to explore career options, experienced professionals contemplating a career change, parents who want to return to the world of work after taking time to raise their child, or people seeking employment. Career counselling is also offered in various settings, including in groups and individually, in person or by means of digital communication.\n\nSeveral approaches have been undertaken to systemize the variety of professional activities related to career guidance and counseling. In the most recent attempt, the Network for Innovation in Career Guidance and Counselling in Europe (NICE) – a consortium of 45 European institutions of higher education in the field of career counseling – has agreed on a system of professional roles for guidance counselors. Each of these five roles is seen as an important facet of the \"career guidance and counselling profession\". Career counselors performing in any of these roles are expected to behave professionally, e.g. by following ethical standards in their practice. The NICE Professional Roles (NPR) are: \n\nThe description of the NICE Professional Roles (NPR) draws on a variety of prior models to define the central activities and competences of guidance counselors. The NPR can, therefore, be understood as a state-of-the-art framework which includes all relevant aspects of career counselling. For this reason, other models haven't been included here so far. Models which are reflected in the NPR include: \n\nEmpirical research attests the effectiveness of career counseling. Professional career counselors can support people with career-related challenges. Through their expertise in career development and labor markets, they can put a person's qualifications, experience, strengths and weakness in a broad perspective while also considering their desired salary, personal hobbies and interests, location, job market and educational possibilities. Through their counseling and teaching abilities, career counselors can additionally support people in gaining a better understanding of what really matters for them personally, how they can plan their careers autonomously, or help them in making tough decisions and getting through times of crisis. Finally, career counselors are often capable of supporting their clients in finding suitable placements/ jobs, in working out conflicts with their employers, or finding the support of other helpful services. It is due to these various benefits of career counseling that policy makers in many countries publicly fund guidance services. For example, the European Union understands career guidance and counseling as an instrument to effectively combat social exclusion and increase citizens' employability. \n\nFrank Parson's \"Choosing a Vocation\" (1909) was perhaps the first major work which is concerned with careers guidance.\n\nWhile until the 1970s a strongly normative approach was characteristic for theories (e.g. of Donald E. Super's \"life-span approach\") and practice of career counseling (e.g. concept of \"matching\"), new models have their starting point in the individual needs and transferable skills of the clients while managing biographical breaks and discontinuities. Career development is no longer viewed as a linear process which reflects a predictable world of work. More consideration is now placed on nonlinear, chance and unplanned influences.\n\nThis change of perspective is evident in the constructivist and social constructionist paradigms for career counselling. The constructivist/social constructionist paradigms are applied as narrative career counseling that emphasizes personal stories and the meaning individuals generate in relation to their education and work.\n\nPostmodern career counselling is a reflective process of assisting clients in creating self through writing and revising biographical narratives taking place in a context of multiple choice from a diversity of options and constraints. The shift moves from emphasizing career choice to empowering self-affirmation and improving decision making.\nRecently this approach is widely applied in Australia such as in Athlete Career and Education (ACE) program by Australian Sports Commission and Scope for artists by Ausdance.\n\nThere is no international standard qualification for professional career counselors, although various certificates are offered nationally and internationally (e.g. by professional associations). The number of degree programs in career guidance and/or career counseling is growing worldwide. The title \"career counselor\" is unregulated, unlike engineers or psychologists whose professional titles are legally protected. At the same time, policy makers agree that the competence of career counselors is one of the most important factors in ensuring that people receive high quality support in dealing with their career questions. Depending on the country of their education, career counselors may have a variety of academic backgrounds: In Europe, for instance, degrees in (vocational/ industrial/ organization) psychology and educational sciences are among the most common, but backgrounds in sociology, public administration and other sciences are also frequent. At the same time, many training programs for career counselors are becoming increasingly multidisciplinary.\n\nThere are many career guidance and counseling centers all over the world. They give services of guidance and counseling on higher studies, possibilities, chances and nature of courses and institutes. There are many such service providers all over the world providing online counseling to people about their career or conducting a psychometric test to know the person's aptitude as well as interests.\n\nAssessment tools used in career counseling to help clients make realistic career decisions. These tools generally fall into three categories: interest inventories, personality inventories, and aptitude tests.\n\nInterest inventories are usually based on the premise that if you have similar interests to people in an occupation who like their job, you will probably like that occupation also. Thus, interest inventories may suggest occupations that the client has not thought of and which have a good chance of being something that the client will be happy with. The most common interest inventory is a measure of vocational interests across six domains: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional. People often report a mixture of these domains, usually with one predominant domain.\n\nAptitude tests can predict with good odds whether a particular person will be able to be successful in a particular occupation. For example, a student who wants to be a physicist is unlikely to succeed if he cannot do the math. An aptitude test will tell him if he is likely to do well in advanced math, which is necessary for physics. There are also aptitude tests which can predict success or failure in many different occupations.\n\nPersonality inventories are sometimes used to help people with career choice. The use of these inventories for this purpose is questionable, because in any occupation there are people with many different personalities. A popular personality inventory is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. It is based on Carl Jung’s theory of personality, but Jung never approved it. According to Jung most people fall in the middle of each scale, but the MBTI ignores this and puts everyone in a type category. For example, according to the MBTI, everyone is either an extrovert or an introvert. According to Jung, most people are somewhere in between, and people at the extremes are rare. The validity of the MBTI for career choice is highly questionable.\n\nOne of the major challenges associated with career counseling is encouraging participants to engage in the process. For example, in the UK 70% of people under 14 say they have had no careers advice while 45% of people over 14 have had no or very poor/limited advice.\n\nIn a related issue some client groups tend to reject the interventions made by professional career counselors preferring to rely on the advice of peers or superiors within their own profession. Jackson et al. found that 44% of doctors in training felt that senior members of their own profession were best placed to give careers advice. Furthermore, it is recognised that the giving of career advice is something that is widely spread through a range of formal and informal roles. In addition to career counselors it is also common for psychologists, teachers, managers, trainers and Human Resources (HR) specialists to give formal support in career choices. Similarly it is also common for people to seek informal support from friends and family around their career choices and to bypass career professionals altogether. Today increasingly people rely on career web portals to seek advice on resume writing and handling interviews; as also to research on various professions and companies. It has even become possible to take vocational assessments online.\n\nIn the United States, the designation, \"career counselor\" is not legally protected; that is, anyone can call themselves a career counselor. However, CACREP, the accrediting body for counselor education programs requires that these programmes include one course in career counseling as a part of the coursework for a masters in counseling.\n\nThe National Career Development Association (NCDA), the credentialing body for career counselors, provides various certifications for qualified career counselors. For those university-trained counselors or psychologists who have devoted a certain number of years to career counseling and taken specific coursework, it offers a Master Career Counselor (MCC) credential. The National Career Development Association is the only professional association of career counselors in the United States that provides certification in career counseling.\n\nIn Australia, career counselling may be provided by professionals from various disciplines (e.g., psychology, education, guidance, and counselling). The Professional Standards for Australian Career Development Practitioners provide guidelines about appropriate qualifications and competencies for career counselling. There are a range of postgraduate degrees (e.g., Master, Doctor) that are endorsed for career development practice according to the Professional Standards. The Career Industry Council of Australia (CICA) endorses career development programs in Australia. There are other relevant qualifications but these may necessarily not be endorsed under the provisions of the Professional Standards by CICA. A Diploma of Counselling and a Certificate IV in Career Development are offered at TAFE colleges and other registered training organisations throughout Australia. \n\n\n\n\n "}

It was intended to encourage better economic ties between France and Morocco and as a demonstration of French power in the region. Goods from across Morocco were displayed at the fair and allowed French scholars to assess the state of the craft industry in Morocco. Their findings resulted in the establishment of training centres for Moroccan craftsmen in an attempt to encourage the industry.\n\nThe French had held a protectorate over Morocco since the Treaty of Fez in 1912 and were engaged in pacification and occupation of much of the country through military operations such as the Zaian War. The French resident-general, Hubert Lyautey, wished to open up the Moroccan markets to French goods and to better integrate Moroccan industries with those of France. The Casablanca fair was the first of several held to further this aim and to demonstrate French power in the region.\n\nThe fair was held between 5 September and 5 November despite the ongoing First World War and indeed occurred during the \"deadliest moment of the war in France\". The organisation of the fair was managed by the French authorities, though they encouraged the participation of the Moroccan population in the fair itself. Separate pavilions were erected to house displays representative of the products of each region of Morocco and for at least one government body, there were also tents erected in which Moorish merchants displayed their goods and various curiosities. The fair was also the catalyst for the creation of a fire department for Casablanca. \n\nOne objective of the fair was to inventory all the items that Morocco imported from Europe so that the French could plan to provide these directly in the future. In addition scholars used the fair to undertake studies on all the resources that Morocco could offer, including her craft industries, and to better organise their exploitation. The scholars concluded that earlier Moroccan pieces were of better quality. They considered that the height of the craft industry had passed with modern items showing a decline in quality of design, raw materials, pigmentation and skill of the craftsmen. Encouraged by examples of work produced by Moroccan children in the new grammar and vocational schools (displayed at the fair by the General Administration of Public Instruction), the French authorities believed that a new generation of craftsmen could be trained at such establishments. They subsequently ran adult education programmes and apprenticeship schemes at the schools, in which Moroccans were taught to copy older examples of craftware collected by French specialists. Two \"Inspection Offices of the Native Craft Industry\" were established at Fes and Rabat with attached museums and workshops to serve as centres for new Moroccan craftware production. Replicas of older items were housed in the new museums and also sent to exhibitions in Morocco and abroad where they were offered for sale.\n"}
{"id": "321449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=321449", "title": "Chanson de geste", "text": "Chanson de geste\n\nThe chanson de geste (, from Latin \"deeds, actions accomplished\") is a medieval narrative, a type of epic poem that appears at the dawn of French literature. The earliest known poems of this genre date from the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, before the emergence of the lyric poetry of the trouvères (troubadours) and the earliest verse romances. They reached their apogee in the period 1150–1250.\n\nComposed in verse, these narrative poems of moderate length (averaging 4000 lines) were originally sung, or (later) recited, by minstrels or jongleurs. More than one hundred \"chansons de geste\" have survived in around three hundred manuscripts that date from the 12th to the 15th century.\n\nSince the 19th century, much critical debate has centered on the origins of the \"chansons de geste\", and particularly on explaining the length of time between the composition of the \"chansons\" and the actual historical events which they reference. The historical events the \"chansons\" allude to occur in the eighth through tenth centuries, yet the earliest \"chansons\" we have were probably composed at the end of the eleventh century: only three \"chansons de geste\" have a composition that incontestably dates from before 1150: the \"Chanson de Guillaume\", \"The Song of Roland\" and \"Gormont et Isembart\": the first half of the \"Chanson de Guillaume\" may date from as early as the eleventh century; \"Gormont et Isembart\" may date from as early as 1068, according to one expert; and \"The Song of Roland\" probably dates from after 1086 to c.1100.\n\nThree early theories of the origin of \"chansons de geste\" believe in the continued existence of epic material (either as lyric poems, epic poems or prose narrations) in these intervening two or three centuries. Critics like Claude Charles Fauriel, François Raynouard and German Romanticists like Jacob Grimm posited the spontaneous creation of lyric poems by the people as a whole at the time of the historic battles, which were later put together to form the epics. This was the basis for the \"cantilena\" theory of epic origin, which was elaborated by Gaston Paris, although he maintained that single authors, rather than the multitude, were responsible for the songs.\n\nThis theory was also supported by Robert Fawtier and by Léon Gautier (although Gautier thought the \"cantilenae\" were composed in Germanic languages). At the end of the nineteenth century, Pio Rajna, seeing similarities between the \"chansons de geste\" and old Germanic/Merovingian tales, posited a Germanic origin for the French poems. A different theory, introduced by the medievalist Paul Meyer, suggested the poems were based on old prose narrations of the original events.\n\nAnother theory (largely discredited today), developed by Joseph Bédier, posited that the early \"chansons\" were recent creations, not earlier than the year 1000, developed by singers who, emulating the songs of \"saints lives\" sung in front of churches (and collaborating with the church clerics), created epic stories based on the heroes whose shrines and tombs dotted the great pilgrimage routes, as a way of drawing pilgrims to these churches. Critics have also suggested that knowledge by clerics of ancient Latin epics may have played a role in their composition.\n\nSubsequent criticism has vacillated between \"traditionalists\" (\"chansons\" created as part of a popular tradition) and \"individualists\" (\"chansons\" created by a unique author), but more recent historical research has done much to fill in gaps in the literary record and complicate the question of origins. Critics have discovered manuscripts, texts and other traces of the legendary heroes, and further explored the continued existence of a Latin literary tradition (c.f. the scholarship of Ernst Robert Curtius) in the intervening centuries. The work of Jean Rychner on the art of the minstrels and the work of Parry and Lord on Yugoslavian oral traditional poetry, Homeric verse and oral composition have also been suggested to shed light on the \"oral\" composition of the \"chansons\", although this view is not without its critics who maintain the importance of \"writing\" not only in the preservation of the texts, but also in their composition, especially for the more sophisticated poems.\n\nComposed in Old French and apparently intended for oral performance by jongleurs, the \"chansons de geste\" narrate legendary incidents (sometimes based on real events) in the history of France during the eighth, ninth and tenth centuries, the age of Charles Martel, Charlemagne and Louis the Pious, with emphasis on their conflicts with the Moors and Saracens, and also disputes between kings and their vassals.\n\nThe traditional subject matter of the \"chansons de geste\" became known as the Matter of France. This distinguished them from romances concerned with the Matter of Britain, that is, King Arthur and his knights; and with the so-called Matter of Rome, covering the Trojan War, the conquests of Alexander the Great, the life of Julius Cæsar and some of his Imperial successors, who were given medieval makeovers as exemplars of chivalry.\n\nA key theme of the \"chansons de geste\", which set them off from the romances (which tended to explore the role of the \"individual\"), is their critique and celebration of community/collectivity (their epic heroes are portrayed as figures in the destiny of the nation and Christianity) and their representation of the complexities of feudal relations and service.\n\nThe subject matter of the \"chansons\" evolved over time, according to public taste. Alongside the great battles and scenes of historic prowess of the early \"chansons\" there began to appear other themes. Realistic elements (money, urban scenes) and elements from the new court culture (female characters, the role of love) began to appear. Other fantasy and adventure elements, derived from the romances, were gradually added: giants, magic, and monsters increasingly appear among the foes along with Muslims. There is also an increasing dose of Eastern adventure, drawing on contemporary experiences in the Crusades; in addition, one series of \"chansons\" retells the events of the First Crusade and the first years of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The conflicts of the 14th century (Hundred Years' War) brought a renewed epic spirit and nationalistic (or propagandistic) fervor to some \"chansons de geste\" (such as \"La Chanson de Hugues Capet\").\n\nThe poems contain an assortment of character types; the repertoire of valiant hero, brave traitor, shifty or cowardly traitor, Saracen giant, beautiful Saracen princess, and so forth. As the genre matured, fantasy elements were introduced. Some of the characters that were devised by the poets in this manner include the fairy Oberon, who made his literary debut in \"Huon de Bordeaux\"; and the magic horse Bayard, who first appears in \"Renaud de Montauban\". Quite soon an element of self-parody appears; even the august Charlemagne was not above gentle mockery in the \"Pèlerinage de Charlemagne\".\n\nThe narrative structure of the \"chanson de geste\" has been compared to the one in the Nibelungenlied and in creole legends by Henri Wittmann on the basis of common narreme structure as first developed in the work of Eugene Dorfman and Jean-Pierre Tusseau\n\nEarly \"chansons de geste\" were typically composed in ten-syllable lines grouped in assonanced (meaning that the last stressed vowel is the same in each line throughout the stanza, but the last consonant differs from line to line) stanzas (called \"laisses\"). These stanzas are of variable length.\n\nAn example from the \"Chanson de Roland\" illustrates the technique of the ten-syllable assonanced form. The assonance in this stanza is on e:\nLater \"chansons\" were composed in monorhyme stanzas, in which the last syllable of each line rhymes fully throughout the stanza. Later \"chansons\" also tended to be composed using alexandrines (twelve-syllable) lines, instead of ten-syllable lines (some early \"chansons\", such as \"Girart de Vienne\", were even adapted into a twelve-syllable version).\n\nThe following example of the twelve-syllable rhymed form is from the opening lines of \"Les Chétifs\", a \"chanson\" in the Crusade cycle. The rhyme is on ie:\nThese forms of versification were substantially different than the forms found in the Old French verse romances (\"romans\") which were written in octosyllabic rhymed couplets.\n\nThe public of the \"chansons de geste\"—the lay (secular) public of the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries—was largely illiterate, except for (at least to the end of the 12th century) members of the great courts and (in the south) smaller noble families. Thus, the \"chansons\" were primarily an oral medium.\n\nOpinions vary greatly on whether the early \"chansons\" were first written down and then read from manuscripts (although parchment was quite expensive) or memorized for performance, or whether portions were improvised, or whether they were entirely the product of spontaneous oral composition and later written down. Similarly, scholars differ greatly on the social condition and literacy of the poets themselves; were they cultured clerics or illiterate jongleurs working within an oral tradition? As an indication of the role played by orality in the tradition of the \"chanson de geste\", lines and sometimes whole stanzas, especially in the earlier examples, are noticeably formulaic in nature, making it possible both for the poet to construct a poem in performance and for the audience to grasp a new theme with ease.\n\nScholarly opinions differ on the exact manner of recitation, but it is generally believed that the \"chansons de geste\" were originally sung (whereas the medieval romances were probably spoken) by poets, minstrels or jongleurs, who would sometimes accompany themselves, or be accompanied, on the \"vielle\", a mediæval fiddle played with a bow. Several manuscript texts include lines in which the jongleur demands attention, threatens to stop singing, promises to continue the next day, and asks for money or gifts. By the middle of the 13th century, singing had probably given way to recitation.\n\nIt has been calculated that a reciter could sing about a thousand verses an hour and probably limited himself to 1000–1300 verses by performance, making it likely that the performance of works extended over several days. Given that many \"chansons\" from the late twelfth century on extended to over 10,000 verses or more (for example, \"Aspremont\" comprises 11,376 verses, while \"Quatre Fils Aymon\" comprises 18,489 verses), it is conceivable that few spectators heard the longest works in their entirety.\n\nWhile poems like \"The Song of Roland\" were sometimes heard in public squares and were no doubt warmly received by a broad public, some critics caution that the \"chansons\" should probably not be characterized as popular literature and some \"chansons\" appear particularly tailored for an audience of aristocratic, privileged or warrior classes.\n\nMore than one hundred \"chansons de geste\" have survived in around three hundred manuscripts that date from the 12th to the 15th century. Several popular \"chansons\" were written down more than once in varying forms. The earliest \"chansons\" are all (more or less) anonymous; many later ones have named authors.\n\nBy the middle of the 12th century, the corpus of works was being expanded principally by \"cyclisation\", that is to say by the formation of \"cycles\" of \"chansons\" attached to a character or group of characters—with new \"chansons\" being added to the ensemble by singing of the earlier or later adventures of the hero, of their youthful exploits (\"enfances\"), the great deeds of their ancestors or descendants, or their retreat from the world to a convent (\"moniage\") – or attached to an event (like the Crusades).\n\nAbout 1215 Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube, in the introductory lines to his \"Girart de Vienne\", subdivided the Matter of France, the usual subject area of the \"chansons de geste\", into three cycles, which revolved around three main characters (see quotation at Matter of France). There are several other less formal lists of \"chansons\", or of the legends they incorporate. One can be found in the fabliau entitled \"Des Deux Bordeors Ribauz\", a humorous tale of the second half of the 13th century, in which a jongleur lists the stories he knows. Another is included by the Catalan troubadour Guiraut de Cabrera in his humorous poem \"Ensenhamen\", better known from its first words as \"Cabra juglar\": this is addressed to a \"juglar\" (jongleur) and purports to instruct him on the poems he ought to know but doesn't.\n\nThe listing below is arranged according to Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube's cycles, extended with two additional groupings and with a final list of \"chansons\" that fit into no cycle. There are numerous differences of opinion about the categorization of individual \"chansons\".\n\nThe chief character is usually Charlemagne or one of his immediate successors. A pervasive theme is the King's role as champion of Christianity. This cycle contains the first of the \"chansons\" to be written down, the \"Chanson de Roland\" or \"The Song of Roland\".\n\nThe central character is not Garin de Monglane but his supposed great-grandson, Guillaume d'Orange. These \"chansons\" deal with knights who were typically younger sons, not heirs, who seek land and glory through combat with the Infidel (in practice, Muslim) enemy.\n\n\nThis cycle concerns traitors and rebels against royal authority. In each case the revolt ends with the defeat of the rebels and their eventual repentance.\n\n\nThis local cycle of epics of Lorraine traditional history, in the late form in which it is now known, includes details evidently drawn from \"Huon de Bordeaux\" and \"Ogier le Danois\".\n\n\nNot listed by Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube, this cycle deals with the First Crusade and its immediate aftermath.\n\n\nThe \"chansons de geste\" reached their apogee in the period 1150–1250. By the middle of the 13th century, public taste in France had begun to abandon these epics, preferring, rather, the romances. As the genre progressed in the middle of the 13th century, only certain traits (like versification, \"laisse\" structure, formulaic forms, setting, and other clichés of the genre) remained to set the \"chansons\" apart from the romances. The 15th century saw the cycles of \"chansons\" (along with other chronicles) converted into large prose compilations (such as the compilation made by David Aubert). Yet, the themes of the epics continued to exert an influence through the 16th century.\n\nThe \"chansons de geste\" created a body of mythology that lived on well after they ceased to be produced in France.\n\nThe French \"chanson\" gave rise to the Old Spanish tradition of the \"cantar de gesta\".\n\nThe \"chanson de geste\" was also adapted in southern (Occitan-speaking) France. One of the three surviving manuscripts of the \"chanson\" Girart de Roussillon (12th century) is in Occitan, as are two works based on the story of Charlemagne and Roland, \"Rollan a Saragossa\" and \"Ronsasvals\" (early 12th century). The \"chanson de geste\" form was also used in such Occitan texts as \"Canso d'Antioca\" (late 12th century), \"Daurel e Betó\" (first half of the 13th century), and \"Song of the Albigensian Crusade\" (c.1275) (cf Occitan literature).\n\nIn medieval Germany, the \"chansons de geste\" elicited little interest from the German courtly audience, unlike the romances which were much appreciated. While \"The Song of Roland\" was among the first French epics to be translated into German (by Konrad der Pfaffe as the \"Rolandslied\", c.1170), and the German poet Wolfram von Eschenbach based his (incomplete) 13th century epic \"Willehalm\" (consisting of seventy-eight manuscripts) on the \"Aliscans\", a work in the cycle of William of Orange (Eschenbach's work had a great success in Germany), these remained isolated examples. Other than a few other works translated from the cycle of Charlemagne in the 13th century, the \"chansons de geste\" were not adapted into German, and it is believed that this was because the epic poems lacked what the romances specialized in portraying: scenes of idealized knighthood, love and courtly society.\n\nIn the late 13th century, certain French \"chansons de geste\" were adapted into the Old Norse \"Karlamagnús saga\".\n\nIn Italy, there exist several 14th-century texts in verse or prose which recount the feats of Charlemagne in Spain, including a \"chanson de geste\" in Franco-Venetian, the \"Entrée d'Espagne\" (c.1320) (notable for transforming the character of Roland into a knight errant, similar to heroes from the Arthurian romances), and a similar Italian epic \"La Spagna\" (1350–1360) in ottava rima. Through such works, the \"Matter of France\" became an important source of material (albeit significantly transformed) in Italian romantic epics. \"Morgante\" (c.1483) by Luigi Pulci, \"Orlando innamorato\" (1495) by Matteo Maria Boiardo, \"Orlando furioso\" (1516) by Ludovico Ariosto, and \"Jerusalem Delivered\" (1581) by Torquato Tasso are all indebted to the French narrative material (the Pulci, Boiardo and Ariosto poems are founded on the legends of the paladins of Charlemagne, and particularly, of Roland, translated as \"Orlando\").\n\nThe incidents and plot devices of the Italian epics later became central to works of English literature such as Edmund Spenser's \"The Faerie Queene\"; Spenser attempted to adapt the form devised to tell the tale of the triumph of Christianity over Islam to tell instead of the triumph of Protestantism over Roman Catholicism.\n\nThe Welsh poet, painter, soldier and engraver David Jones's Modernist poem In Parenthesis was described by contemporary critic Herbert Read as having \"the heroic ring which we associate with the old chansons de geste\".\n\n\n\n"}

The film stars an ensemble cast of Will Smith, Edward Norton, Keira Knightley, Michael Peña, Naomie Harris, Jacob Latimore, Kate Winslet, and Helen Mirren. It follows a man who copes with his daughter's death by writing letters to time, death, and love.\n\nThe film premiered at the Dubai International Film Festival on December 13, 2016, and was released in the United States on December 16, 2016. It was panned by critics, although it grossed $88 million worldwide against its net $36 million budget.\n\nSuccessful advertising executive Howard Inlet becomes clinically depressed after his young daughter's tragic death. He spends his time alone, rarely sleeping or eating, and at the office building domino chains and structures. His estranged friends and business partners, Whit Yardsham, Claire Wilson, and Simon Scott fear for Howard's mental health as well as their company's future, as his behavior has cost them numerous high-profile clients and left them on the verge of bankruptcy. As the majority shareholder, Howard has also undermined their efforts to sell the company.\n\nThe trio hire a private investigator, Sally Price, to acquire evidence that Howard is unfit to run the company, allowing them to take control. Sally intercepts three letters written by Howard which he posted to the abstract concepts of Love, Time, and Death, and presents them to Whit, Claire, and Simon. They hire a trio of struggling actors – Brigitte, Raffi, and Amy – to masquerade as Death, Time, and Love to confront Howard about his letters. Their plan is for Sally to record these encounters and then digitally erase Amy, Raffi, and Brigitte to make Howard appear mentally unbalanced, enabling them to sell the company.\n\nIn preparation for their roles, Brigitte, Raffi, and Amy spend time with Simon, Claire, and Whit, who are going through personal problems of their own: Simon is secretly battling cancer; Whit is struggling to connect with his pre-teen daughter Allison after cheating on her mother; and Claire is looking for sperm donors to conceive a child after neglecting her private life for years.\n\nAfter his encounters with Brigitte, Raffi, and Amy, Howard attends a grief support group and befriends Madeleine, who has lost her daughter, Olivia, to cancer, which led to the end of her marriage. As he meets with Madeleine, she shows him a note from her husband, \"If only we could be strangers again...\" and continues enigmatically \"And now we are.\" Howard tells her about his recent \"conversations\" with Death, Time, and Love. She tells him that on the day Olivia died, an old woman at the hospital had told her to notice the \"Collateral Beauty\", which she has learned to recognize as acts of selfless kindness that follow tragedies.\n\nAs the group is discussing the actors' performances, Amy storms out of the room because she feels guilty about manipulating Howard. Whit goes to convince her to return and declares romantic interest in her. She rejects him, but agrees to commit to their plan if he will make amends with his daughter. Simon similarly confides with Brigitte about his condition and his fear of death. She encourages him to share the burden with his family.\n\nAmy, Raffi, and Brigitte confront Howard again, and he lashes out at them, particularly Amy, externalizing the pain he held inside since his daughter's death. Amy tells Howard he owes it to his daughter's existence to love and that he can't live without it. The next day, Howard attends a meeting with his company's board of directors in which footage of the incidents, with the actors digitally removed, is shown. He realizes his mental state and behavior are ruining the company. He voices his gratitude for all that his friends have done for him, and promises to be there in their times of need. He then signs documents to ensure the agency's survival.\n\nAfter the meeting there is a chain reaction: Simon tells his wife about his health condition, and she comforts him. Claire meets with Raffi, and he states she will make a good mother someday. She says time has caught up to her, to which he replies that her battle with time isn't over yet, and mentions people who had had a positive effect on his young life. Whit visits Allison at school. Although she refuses to speak to him, he expresses his love for her and vows to return every day until she talks to him. Allison reconsiders, and in parting, mentions that \"tomorrow is a half day\".\n\nHoward visits Madeleine on Christmas Eve, and she persuades him to watch a video of her husband playing with their daughter, who turn out to be Howard and Olivia. Howard is able to acknowledge his daughter's name and condition, and hugs Madeleine while crying. Brigitte is revealed to be the woman who had told Madeleine about Collateral Beauty.\n\nAt the end, we see Howard and Madeleine walk hand-in-hand through Central Park. He turns and sees Amy, Raffi and Brigitte watching from a footbridge, but they vanish as Madeleine turns toward them, revealing that they truly are Love, Death and Time, and they appeared to the ones who were in need of help.\n\nOn May 13, 2015, it was announced that Hugh Jackman and Rooney Mara would star in the New York-set drama \"Collateral Beauty\", to be directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon and written by Allan Loeb. Loeb wrote the script on spec, saying, \"It's something that I've meditated on for a couple of years, the idea of someone who's been through a terrible loss, and was angry and twice destroyed and wrote letters to the Universe. I didn't know why or how or what that meant for years, but it wouldn't leave me alone.\" Michael Sugar and Bard Dorros were set to produce through their Anonymous Content banner. On June 9, 2015, PalmStar Media's Kevin Frakes came on board to produce and fully finance the film, and Likely Story was also on board to co-produce the film, with Loeb also producing. On June 15, 2015, \"Variety\" reported that Jason Segel was in talks to join the cast. On July 15, 2015, it was announced that Jackman had exited the project due to his commitment with 20th Century Fox's \"Logan\" film, and producers were eyeing Johnny Depp to star instead.\n\nOn August 4, 2015, Will Smith was cast to play the lead, replacing Jackman, while Smith's Overbrook Entertainment was set to also produce the film. On September 8, 2015, it was announced that New Line Cinema had come on board to handle worldwide distribution for the film, while Mara had left the project. On October 5, 2015, director Gomez-Rejon exited the film due to creative differences with the studio. On November 10, 2015, it was announced that David Frankel was nearing a deal to direct the film. On December 1, 2015, \"Variety\" reported that Helen Mirren was in early talks to join the cast, with filming expected to begin early 2016 in New York City.

It made $2.4 million on its first day, lowering weekend projections to $7.5 million. It ended up grossing $7.1 million, finishing 4th at the box office and marking the lowest opening of Will Smith's career.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 14% based on 167 reviews, and an average rating of 3.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Well-meaning but fundamentally flawed, \"Collateral Beauty\" aims for uplift but collapses in unintentional hilarity.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 23 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 76% overall positive score and a 55% \"definite recommend\".\n\nVince Mancini of \"Uproxx\" criticized the film for its misleading trailers and dialogue, writing, \"Edward Norton's character tells Keira Knightley's about holding his now-estranged daughter (he's a workaholic!) in his arms for the first time. 'It wasn't that I felt love, it was that I felt like I had become love'.\" Richard Roeper gave the film one out of four stars, saying, \"\"Collateral Beauty\" is a fraud. It is built on a foundation so contrived, so off-putting, so treacly, the most miraculous thing about this movie is this movie was actually made.\"\n\nLeon Thomas, of film web-series \"Renegade Cut\" fame, analyzed negatively on the film's plot contrivances and inconsequential details; it was his pick for the worst film of 2016.\n\n"}

A country bumpkin, he is arrested in the first scene for flouting the king's proclamation that all men of the court avoid the company of women for three years. While in custody, the men of the court use him to further their own romantic endeavors. By sending love notes to the wrong women and blurting out secrets (including that of an unplanned pregnancy), Costard makes fools of the royal court. Along with Moth the page and Jaquenetta, a country wench, Costard pokes fun at the upper-class. While mocking a pedantic schoolmaster, Costard uses the word \"honorificabilitudinitatibus\", the longest word by far from any of Shakespeare's works.\n\nCostard makes many clever puns, and is used as a tool by Shakespeare to explain new words such as \"remuneration\". He is sometimes considered one of the smartest characters in the play due to his wit and wordplay.\n\nCostard's name is an archaic term for apple, or metaphorically a man's head.

Earliest depictions of dreadlocks date from over 2000 years ago.\n\nThe ancient Vedic scriptures of India which are thousands of years old have the earliest evidence of jaata/locks which are almost exclusively worn by holy men and women.\nIt has been part of a religious practice for Shiva followers.\n\nSome of the earliest depictions of dreadlocks date back as far as 3600 years to the Minoan Civilization, one of Europe's earliest civilizations, centred in Crete (now part of Greece). Frescoes discovered on the Aegean island of Thera (modern Santorini, Greece) depict individuals with braided hair styled in long dreadlocks. \n\nIn ancient Egypt, examples of Egyptians wearing locked hairstyles and wigs have appeared on bas-reliefs, statuary and other artifacts. Mummified remains of ancient Egyptians with locked wigs have also been recovered from archaeological sites.\n\nDuring the Bronze Age and Iron Age, many peoples in the Near East, Asia Minor, Caucasus, East Mediterranean and North Africa such as the Sumerians, Elamites, Ancient Egyptians, Ancient Greeks, Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Hittites, Amorites, Mitanni, Hattians, Hurrians, Arameans, Eblaites, Israelites, Phrygians, Lydians, Persians, Medes, Parthians, Chaldeans, Armenians, Georgians, Azeris, Cilicians and Canaanites/Phoenicians/Carthaginians are depicted in art with braided or plaited hair and beards.\n\nIn Ancient Greece, kouros sculptures from the archaic period depict men wearing dreadlocks while Spartan hoplites wore formal locks as part of their battle dress. Spartan magistrates known as Ephors also wore their hair braided in long locks, an Archaic Greek tradition that was steadily abandoned in other Greek kingdoms. \n\nThe style was worn by Ancient Christian Ascetics in the Middle East and Mediterranean, and the Dervishes of Islam, among others. Some of the very earliest adherents of Christianity in the Middle East may have worn this hairstyle; there are descriptions of James the Just, first Bishop of Jerusalem, who is said to have worn them to his ankles.\n\nPre-Columbian Aztec priests were described in Aztec codices (including the Durán Codex, the Codex Tudela and the Codex Mendoza) as wearing their hair untouched, allowing it to grow long and matted. Bernal Diaz del Castillo records:here were priests with long robes of black cloth... The hair of these priests was very long and so matted that it could not be separated or disentangled, and most of them had their ears scarified, and their hair was clotted with blood.In Senegal, the Baye Fall, followers of the Mouride movement, a Sufi movement of Islam founded in 1887 AD by Shaykh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke, are famous for growing locks and wearing multi-colored gowns. Cheikh Ibra Fall, founder of the Baye Fall school of the Mouride Brotherhood, popularized the style by adding a mystic touch to it. Warriors among the Fulani, Wolof and Serer in Mauritania, and Mandinka in Mali and Niger were known for centuries to have worn cornrows when young and dreadlocks when old.\n\nLarry Wolff in his book \"Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on the Mind of Enlightenment\" mentions that in Poland, for about a thousand years, some people wore the hair style of the Scythians. Zygmunt Gloger in his \"Encyklopedia staropolska\" mentions that Polish plait (dreadlocks or plica polonica) was worn as a hair style by some people of both genders in the Pinsk region and the Masovia region at the beginning of the 19th century. Gloger argued that according to research done by the Grimm Brothers and Rosenbaum, plica polonica and the idea that it spread from Poland was an error, as it was also found among the Germanic population of Bavaria and Rhine River area. He said that the word \"Weichselzopf\" (Vistula plait) was a later alteration of the name \"Wichtelzopf\", \"plait of a Wichtel\"; \"Wichtel\" means wight in German, a being or sentient thing.\n\nLocks have been worn for various reasons in each culture: as an expression of deep religious or spiritual convictions, ethnic pride, as a political statement and in more modern times, as a representation of a free, alternative or natural spirit. Their use has also been raised in debates about cultural appropriation. \n\nMembers of various African ethnic groups wear locks and the styles and significance may differ from one group to another.\n\nMaasai warriors are famous for their long, thin, red locks. Many people dye their hair red with root extracts or red ochre. In various cultures what are known as shamans, spiritual men or women who serve and speak to spirits or deities, often wear locks. In Nigeria, some children are born with naturally locked hair and are given a special name: \"Dada\". Yoruba priests of Olokun, the Orisha of the deep ocean, wear locks. Another group is the Turkana people of Kenya. In Ghana, the Akan refer to dreadlocks as \"Mpɛsɛ\", which is the hairstyle of Akomfoɔ or priests and even common people. Along with the Asante-Akan drums known as \"Kete\" drums, this hairstyle was later adopted by Rastafarians, with roots in Jamaica from the slave trade era.\n\nHistorically, many indigenous Australians of North West and North Central Australia wore their hair in a locked style, sometimes also having long beards that were fully or partially locked. Some wore the locks loose, while others wrapped the locks around their heads, or bound them at the back of the head. In North Central Australia, the locks were often greased with fat and coated with red ochre, which assisted in their formation. \n\nHindu Vedic scriptures provide the earliest known evidence of dreadlocks. Locks are worn in India by Sadhus or Holy men. \nThe Nagas are ascetics and followers of the god Shiva. They wear their Jaata (locks) above their head and let them down only for special occasions and rituals. Jaata means twisted locks of hair. Indian holy men and women regard locks as sacred, considered to be a religious practice and an expression for their disregard of vanity.\n\nWithin Tibetan Buddhism and other more esoteric forms of Buddhism, dreadlocks have occasionally been substituted for the more traditional shaved head. The most recognizable of these groups are known as the Ngagpas of Tibet. For many practicing Buddhists, dreadlocks are a way to let go of material vanity and excessive attachments. Dreadlocks were required for many esoteric Buddhist rituals in medieval South Asia performed by Buddhist yogis (Buddhist counterparts to contemporary Hindu sadhus). For instance, 1.4.15 of the Hevajratantra states that the practitioner \"should arrange his piled up hair\". In contemporary Tibetan practice matted hair is replaced by crowns with matted hair attached to them.\n\nRastafari movement locks are symbolic of the Lion of Judah which is sometimes centered on the Ethiopian flag. Rastafari hold that Haile Selassie is a direct descendant of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, through their son Menelik I. Their dreadlocks were inspired by the Nazarites of the Bible.\n\nMuch like the adoption of grandiose names by individuals and organisations, the cultivation of dreadlocks in the later Rastafari movement established a closer connection between the movement and the ideology it espoused. It also gave the appearance, if not the substance, of greater authority.\n\nWhen reggae music gained popularity and mainstream acceptance in the 1970s thanks to Bob Marley's music and cultural influence, the locks (often called \"dreads\") became a notable fashion statement worldwide; they have been worn by prominent authors, actors, athletes and rappers.\n\nDreadlocks have become a popular hairstyle among professional athletes, ranging from Larry Fitzgerald's dreads down to his back to Drew Gooden's facial dreadlocks. \n\nIn professional American football, the number of players with dreadlocks has increased ever since Al Harris and Ricky Williams first wore the style during the 1990s. In 2012, about 180 National Football League players wore dreadlocks. A significant number of these players are defensive backs, who are less likely to be tackled than offensive players. Players with very long dreadlocks have been tackled by their hair, which is legal according to NFL rules.\n\nIn the NBA there has been controversy over the Brooklyn Nets guard, Jeremy Lin. Lin, an Asian-American, garnered mild controversy over his choice of dreadlocks. Former NBA player Kenyon Martin accused Lin of appropriating African-American culture in a since-deleted social media post.\nAfrican Americans as well as non-American blacks have developed a large variety of ways to wear dreadlocked hair. Specific elements of these styles include the flat-twist, in which a section of locks are rolled together flat against the scalp to create an effect similar to the cornrows, and braided dreadlocks. Examples include flat-twisted half-back styles, flat-twisted mohawk styles, braided buns and braid-outs (or lock crinkles).\n\nLocked models have appeared at fashion shows, and Rasta clothing with a Jamaican-style reggae look was sold. Even exclusive fashion brands like Christian Dior created whole Rasta-inspired collections worn by models with a variety of lock hairstyles.\n\nWith dreadlocks style in vogue, the fashion and beauty industries capitalized on the trend. A completely new line of hair care products and services in salons catered to a white clientele, offering all sorts of dreadlocks hair care items such as wax (considered unnecessary and even harmful by many), shampoo, and jewelry. Hairstylists created a wide variety of modified locks, including multi-colored synthetic lock hair extensions and \"dread perms\", where chemicals are used to treat the hair.\n\nIn the West, since gatherings of hippies became common in the 1970s, dreadlocks have gained particular popularity among predominantly caucasian, counterculture adherents such as hippies, crust punks, New Age travellers, goths and many members of the Rainbow Family. Many people from these cultures wear dreadlocks for similar reasons: symbolizing a rejection of government-controlled, mass-merchandising culture or to fit in with the people and crowd they want to be a part of (such as those who are fans of reggae music). Members of the cybergoth subculture also often wear blatantly artificial synthetic dreads or \"dreadfalls\" made of synthetic hair, fabric or plastic tubing.\n\nTraditionally, it was believed that in order to create dreadlocks in non afro-textured hair, an individual had to refrain from brushing, combing or cutting. This lack of hair grooming results in what is called \"free form\" or \"neglect\" dreads, where the hair matts together slowly of its own accord. Such dreads tend to vary greatly in size, width, shape, length, and texture. If the wearer is interested in any uniformity of their dreads, they must pull the matted strands of hair apart to ensure large clumps don't form. All that is needed alongside the regular separating of sections is regular washing; oily dirty hair will slide along each other and never form knots. Some people will spray a water solution with added sea salt and essential oils to dry the hair and accelerate the matting process.\n\nA variety of other starter methods have been developed to offer greater control over the general appearance of dreadlocks. They can be formed through a technique called \"twist and rip\", as well as backcombing and rolling.Together, these alternative techniques are more commonly referred to as \"salon\" or \"manicured\" dreadlocks.\n\nUsing beeswax to make dreads can cause problems because it does not wash out, due to the high melting point of natural wax. Because wax is a hydrocarbon, water alone, no matter how hot, will not be able to remove wax.This is often where problems like mold and dread rot come from, the wax clogs inside the length of the dread meaning water can't run out easily. Having wet dreads for long periods of time helps mildew set in, this combined with the wax and every dirt/dust/fluff particle that has stuck to the wax can result in moldy, slimy dreads.\n\nAs with the organic and freeform method, the salon methods rely on hair naturally matting over a period of months to gradually form dreadlocks. The difference is in the initial technique by which loose hair is encouraged to form a rope-like shape. Whereas freeform dreadlocks can be created by simply refraining from combing or brushing hair and occasionally separating matted sections, salon dreadlocks use tool techniques to form the basis of the starter, immature set of dreadlocks. A \"matured\" set of salon dreadlocks won't look the same as a set of dreadlocks that have been started with neglect or freeform.\n\nFor African hair types, salon dreadlocks can be formed by evenly sectioning and styling the loose hair into braids, coils, twists, or using a procedure called dread perming specifically used for straight hair. For European, Indigenous American, Asian, and Indian hair types, Backcombing and Twist and Ripare some of the more popular methods of achieving starter dreadlocks.\n\nRegardless of hair type or texture and starter method used, dreadlocks require time before they are fully matured. The process hair goes through as it develops into matured dreadlocks is continuous.\n\nThere is also the ability to adopt different types of fake dreadlocks that may make the hair look as real as possible. This process is called synthetic dreadlocks. There are two different types of synthetic dreadlocks. The first is dread extensions, in which other hair can be infused with the wearer's own hair. The second is dreadfalls, in which one dread is tied into another with either elastic or lace. Both of these methods are used to make dreads look better and more appealing, and to achieve the desired effect of longer hair.\n\nOn December 10, 2010, the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" rested its \"longest dreadlocks\" category after investigation of its first and only female title holder, Asha Mandela, with this official statement:\n\nFollowing a review of our guidelines for the longest dreadlock, we have taken expert advice and made the decision to rest this category. The reason for this is that it is difficult, and in many cases impossible, to measure the authenticity of the locks due to expert methods employed in the attachment of hair extensions/re-attachment of broken off dreadlocks. Effectively the dreadlock can become an extension and therefore impossible to adjudicate accurately. It is for this reason Guinness World Records has decided to rest the category and will no longer be monitoring the category for longest dreadlock.\n\n\n"}

He was a painter, a sculptor, an etcher, an engraver, and a lithographer of animals, animated landscapes, and portraits.\n\nEugène Verboeckhoven studied under his father, Barthélemy Verboeckhoven, a sculptor. In 1816 he worked under Voituron in Ghent. In the first half of the 19th century, the salons were a home for burgeoning art. Verboeckhoven was a regular participant at the Ghent (1820 and 1824) and Brussels Salons (1827–1860). He visited the Ardennes, France, Great Britain (1826), Germany (1828) and Italy (1841). He was held in high repute and elaborated on the works of artists such as De Jonghe, De Noter, Koekkoek, Daiwaille, Kheelhof, Verheyden, and his pupils Louis-Pierre Verwee and the Tschaggeny brothers. He was a member of the academies of Brussels, Ghent, Antwerp, St. Petersburg and Amsterdam.\n\nVerboeckhoven was an excellent painter of animals and, together with his pupils, appears to have been the last link to a secular tradition with its roots deep in the 17th century, which linked observation of nature, studied composition, and idealized reproduction of reality. Like the Old Masters, he obtained the colour blue for his skies by grinding down lapis lazuli. He was a prolific artist and very meticulous in his preparation: hundreds of sketches and studies were produced on the spot, assembling different elements like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Such was his dexterity that many artists called upon him to enrich their works with some of his animals and figures. Between 1841 and 1842, he visited Italy, Switzerland, and Scotland. His inspiration remained the same and his technique unaltered, but his notebooks were now filled with sketches of different landscapes.\n\nThe beauty that emanates from his paintings occasionally hides Verboeckhoven's fundamental talent for drawing. Attention should first be drawn to his preparatory works: his sketches, lithographs, and engravings. His portraits, historical subjects, and sculptures also merit attention.\n\nA man of his time, he played an important role in the Belgian Revolution of 1830 and was appointed Director General of the Brussels Museums of Fine Arts by the temporary government. Until the end of his life, he was a member of the Committee of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts and when King Leopold I created the category of Fine Arts at the Academy in 1848, he was on the advisory board. Verboeckhoven was also involved in local politics. From 1861 to 1867, he was the Deputy Mayor for the Schaerbeek Council, Brussels.\n\nLike many of his colleagues, Verboeckhoven was a freemason. He joined the Brussels Lodge in 1834 with his brother Charles-Louis, a well-known marine painter, and his initiation took place on 25 February 1834. Shortly after joining, he suggested founding a Freemason museum. He was very attached to his philosophical convictions and from 1834 onwards and systematically after 1850 added the triangle of three Masonic points to his signature. Eugène Verboeckhoven died in Schaerbeek, Brussels, in 1881. His works are held in museums worldwide.\n\n"}

Another definition describes Firgun as a generosity of spirit, an unselfish, empathetic joy that something good has happened, or might happen, to another person. The concept does not have a one-word equivalent in English. The infinitive form of the word, \"Lefargen\", means to make someone feel good without any ulterior motives. This absence of negativity is an integral part of the concept of firgun.\n\nThe word can be traced back to the Yiddish word \"farginen\" (a cognate of the German word \"vergönnen\"). A relatively modern addition to Hebrew, the word was initially used in the 1970s, and gained momentum in subsequent decades. According to Tamar Katriel, professor of communications in the University of Haifa, Firgun differs from giving compliments, since is \"about an affinity that is authentic and without agenda\". The concept of firgun can be found in Talmudic Hebrew as \"ayin tova\" or \"ayin yafa\" - \"a good eye\". Those phrases are not commonly used in modern Hebrew.\n\nIn 2014, Made in JLM, an Israeli non-profit community group, set out to create \"International Firgun Day\", a holiday celebrated yearly on July 17, where people share compliments or express genuine pride in the accomplishment of others on social media.

It is commonly found in arid regions as it provides protection from sunburn, dust and sand. Toward the end of the 1980s, the keffiyeh became a fashion accessory in the United States and, during the 2000s, it became very popular among teenagers in Tokyo, Japan, where it is often worn with camouflage-style clothing.\n\nDuring his sojourn with the Marsh Arabs of Iraq, Gavin Young noted that the local \"sayyids\"—\"venerated men accepted [...] as descendants of the Prophet Muhammad and Ali ibn Abi Talib\"—wore dark green keffiyeh (\"cheffiyeh\") in contrast to the black-and-white checkered examples typical of the area's inhabitants.\n\nMany Palestinian keffiyehs are a mix of cotton and wool, which facilitates quick drying and, when desired, keeping the wearer's head warm. The keffiyeh is usually folded in half (into a triangle) and the fold worn across the forehead. Often, the keffiyeh is held in place by a circlet of rope called an \"agal\" (, \"\"). Some wearers wrap the keffiyeh into a turban, while others wear it loosely draped around the back and shoulders. A \"taqiyah\" is sometimes worn underneath the keffiyeh; in the past, it has also been wrapped around the rim of a fez. The keffiyeh is almost always of white cotton cloth, but many have a checkered pattern in red or black stitched into them. The plain white keffiyeh is most popular in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf—in Kuwait and Bahrain to the exclusion of almost any other style. The keffiyeh is worn by men of all ages, whether on the head or around the shoulders.\n\nIn Jordan, the red-and-white keffiyeh is strongly associated with the country and its heritage, where it is known as the \"shemagh mhadab\". The Jordanian keffiyeh has decorative cotton or wool tassels on the sides; the bigger these tassels, the greater the garment's supposed value and the status of the person wearing it. It has long been worn by Bedouins and villagers and used as a symbol of honor and/or tribal identification. The tasseled red-and-white Jordanian \"shemagh\" is much thicker than the untasseled red-and-white shemagh seen in Persian Gulf countries.\n\nIn Yemen, the keffiyeh is used extensively in both red-white and black-white pattern and in some traditional Yemeni designs and colours. Before the 1950s, multi-colored tribal shemagh were used widely; nowadays, these are mostly worn only in Yemen and Oman, while the black/white, red/white or pure-white styles have come to dominate in the countries of the Persian Gulf and Levant. The shemag is part of an ancient Middle Eastern headgear tradition.\n\nIn Malaysia, the keffiyeh has been worn by Muslim women as one of hijab fashion and during Palestinian struggle against Israel that has caught the attention of international media, many Malaysians wore it to show solidarity for Palestine. \n\nThe keffiyeh, especially the all-white keffiyeh, is also known as the \"ghutrah\". This is particularly common in the Arabian Peninsula, where the optional skullcap is called a keffiyeh. The garment is also known in some areas as the \"\", roughly speaking:\n\nDastmaal Yazdi A traditional scarf in Iran, originally from the Yazd region of Iran.\n\nChafiyeh\n\nA style of Keffiyeh that originated in Iran, based off the Iranian Dastmaal Yazdi with influences from the Palestinian Keffiyeh. Often worn by Shi'a Muslims in Iran as well as Iraq and Lebanon to express support for Shi'a Political parties. The scarf gained popularity during the Iran-Iraq war as a sign of Shi'a resistance against Saddam. The Chafiyeh is also worn by Basij members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, as well as occasionally by members of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces.\n\nTraditionally worn by Palestinian farmers, the keffiyeh became worn by Palestinian men of any rank and became a symbol of Palestinian nationalism during the Arab Revolt of the 1930s. Its prominence increased during the 1960s with the beginning of the Palestinian resistance movement and its adoption by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.\n\nThe black-and-white fishnet pattern keffiyeh would later become Arafat's iconic symbol, and he would rarely be seen without it; only occasionally would he wear a military cap, or, in colder climates, a Russian-style \"ushanka\" hat. Arafat would wear his keffiyeh in a semi-traditional way, wrapped around his head via an \"agal\". He also wore a similarly patterned piece of cloth in the neckline of his military fatigues. Early on, he had made it his personal trademark to drape the scarf over his right shoulder only, arranging it in the rough shape of a triangle, to resemble the outlines of historic Palestine. This way of wearing the keffiyeh became a symbol of Arafat as a person and political leader, and it has not been imitated by other Palestinian leaders.\n\nAnother Palestinian figure associated with the keffiyeh is Leila Khaled, a female member of the armed wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Several photographs of Khaled circulated in the Western newspapers after the hijacking of TWA Flight 840 and the Dawson's Field hijackings. These photos often included Khaled wearing a keffiyeh in the style of a Muslim woman's hijab, wrapped around the head and shoulders. This was unusual, as the keffiyeh is associated with Arab masculinity, and many believe this to be something of a fashion statement by Khaled, denoting her equality with men in the Palestinian armed struggle.\n\nThe colors of the stitching in a keffiyeh are also vaguely associated with Palestinians' political sympathies. Traditional black and white keffiyehs became associated with Fatah. Later, red and white keffiyehs were adopted by Palestinian Marxists, such as the PFLP.\n\nThe color symbolism of the scarves is by no means universally accepted by all Palestinians or Arabs. Its importance should not be overstated, as the scarves are used by Palestinians and Arabs of all political affiliations, as well as by those with no particular political sympathies. \n\nThe black and white chequered keffiyeh has become a symbol of Palestinian nationalism, dating back to the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Outside of the Middle East and North Africa, the keffiyeh first gained popularity among activists supporting the Palestinians in the conflict with Israel.\n\nThe wearing of the keffiyeh often comes with criticism from various political factions in the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The slang \"keffiyeh kinderlach\" refers to young Jews, particularly college students, who sport a keffiyeh around the neck as a political/fashion statement. This term may have first appeared in print in an article by Bradley Burston in which he writes of \"the suburban-exile kaffiyeh kinderlach of Berkeley, more Palestinian by far than the Palestinians\" in their criticism of Israel. European activists have also worn the keffiyeh.\n\nWhile Western protesters wear differing styles and shades of keffiyeh, the most prominent is the black-and-white keffiyeh. This is typically worn around the neck like a neckerchief, simply knotted in the front with the fabric allowed to drape over the back. Other popular styles include rectangular-shaped scarves with the basic black-and-white pattern in the body, with the ends knitted in the form of the Palestinian flag. Since the Al-Aqsa Intifada, these rectangular scarves have increasingly appeared with a combination of the Palestinian flag and Al-Aqsa Mosque printed on the ends of the fabric.\n\nToday, this symbol of Palestinian identity is now largely imported from China. With the scarf's growing popularity in the 2000s, Chinese manufacturers entered the market, driving Palestinians out of the business. In 2008, Yasser Hirbawi, who for five decades had been the only Palestinian manufacturer of keffiyehs, is now struggling with sales.\n\"Mother Jones\" wrote, \"Ironically, global support for Palestinian-statehood-as-fashion-accessory has put yet another nail in the coffin of the Occupied Territories' beleaguered economy.\"\n\nBritish Colonel T. E. Lawrence (better known as Lawrence of Arabia) was probably the best-known Western wearer of the keffiyeh. He wore a plain white one with agal during his involvement in the Arab Revolt in World War I. This image of Lawrence was later popularized by the film epic about him, \"Lawrence of Arabia\", in which he was played by Peter O'Toole.\n\nThe 1920s silent-film era of American cinema saw studios take to Orientalist themes of the exotic Middle East, possibly due to the view of Arabs as part of the allies of World War I, and keffiyehs became a standard part of the theatrical wardrobe. These films and their male leads typically had Western actors in the role of an Arab, often wearing the keffiyeh with the agal (as with \"The Sheik\" and \"The Son of the Sheik\", starring actor Rudolph Valentino).\n\nErwin Rommel also commonly wore a keffiyeh around his neck during the Western Desert Campaign for practical reasons.\n\nFor decades, keffiyeh have been issued to British soldiers who now almost exclusively refer to them as shemaghs (from Arabic \"\"). Their use by some units and formations of the military and police forces of the former British Empire and subsequent Commonwealth dates back to before World War II.\n\nDue to its utility, the keffiyeh has been adopted by the Palestine Police Force, the Transjordan Frontier Force, the Sudan Defence Force, the Arab Legion, the Jordanian Armed Forces, the Libyan Arab Force, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps\nIn the North African campaign of WWII the irregular raiding and reconnaissance units of the Long Range Desert Group, the Special Air Service and \"Popski's Private Army\" wore them while operating in the Western Desert. After the war, their use by the Army continued with the shemagh being worn in both desert and temperate environments in theatres such as Dhofar. Australian Army forces have also used the shemagh since the Vietnam War, and extensively during Iraq and Afghanistan, particularly by Australian Special Forces units. Since the beginning of the War on Terror, these keffiyeh, usually cotton and in military olive drab or khaki with black stitching, have been adopted by US troops as well, a reversal of previous policy which saw them strictly forbidden during the Gulf War.\n\nTheir practicality in arid environments, such as Iraq, explains their enduring popularity with military personnel. Soldiers often wear the keffiyeh folded in half into a triangle and wrapped around the face, with the halfway point being placed over the mouth and nose, sometimes coupled with goggles, to keep sand out of the face. This practice is also common among armoured, mechanised and other vehicle-borne troops, who use it as a scarf in temperate climates to ward off wind chill caused by being in moving vehicles. British soldiers deploying to Iraq or Afghanistan are now issued with a tan-colored shemagh.\n\nThe keffiyeh, called \"chafiyeh\" () in Persian, were extensively used by Iranian infantrymen in Iran–Iraq War.\n\nAs with other articles of clothing worn in wartime, such as the T-shirt, fatigues and khaki pants, the keffiyeh has been seen as chic among non-Arabs in the West. Keffiyehs became popular in the United States in the late 1980s, at the start of the First Intifada, when bohemian girls and punks wore keffiyehs as scarves around their necks. In the early 2000s, keffiyehs were very popular among youths in Tokyo, who often wore them with camouflage clothing. The trend recurred in the mid-2000s in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia, when the keffiyeh became popular as a fashion accessory, usually worn as a scarf around the neck in hipster circles. Stores such as Urban Outfitters and TopShop stocked the item. (After some controversy over the retailer's decision to label the item \"anti-war scarves,\" however, Urban Outfitters pulled it.) In spring 2008, keffiyehs in colors like purple and mauve were given away in issues of fashion magazines in Spain and France. In UAE, males are inclining towards more western headgear while the women are developing preferences for dupatta—the traditional head cover of the Indian subcontinent. The appropriation of the keffiyeh as a fashion statement by non-Arab wearers separate from its political and historical meaning has been the subject of controversy in recent years. While it is worn often as a symbol of solidarity with the Palestinian struggle, the fashion industry has disregarded its significance by using its pattern and style in day-to-day clothing design. For example, in 2016 Topshop released a romper with the Keffiyeh print, calling it a \"scarf playsuit\". This led to accusations of cultural appropriation and Topshop eventually pulled the item from their website\n\n\n\n"}

The display of Kim Il-sung portraits was made mandatory at homes in the 1970s. Gradually, they have become mandatory in certain public places as well, such as factories, airports, railway stations, and rail and subway carriages. Portraits of Kim Jong-il have been hung next to Kim Il-sung since in the late 1970s. A portrait of Kim Jong-un was displayed for the first time in public in 2018.\n\nRules regarding the placement and maintenance of the portraits are complex and change frequently. At homes, they should be placed on the most prominent wall in the living room with nothing else on it, at high and looking downwards. Of importance, and subject to random checks, is that they are kept clean, a responsibility that usually falls on the lady of the house.\n\nSince the 1940s visual depictions of Kim Il-sung have been commonplace in North Korea. The practice was adopted from Stalin portraits in the Soviet Union and portraits of Mao Zedong in China. Displaying a portrait of Kim Il-sung in every house became mandatory in the 1970s. The state distributed such portraits and instructed people to display them in their living rooms. By Kim Il-sung's 60th birthday in 1972, North Korea had more leader portraits than the Soviet Union or China ever did. In 1972, the compulsory display of the portraits was extended to all factories, airports, and railway stations.\n\nAt the end of the decade, North Koreans were told to hang portraits of Kim Jong-il next to their portraits of Kim Il-sung. The regulation was put in place relatively late into Kim Jong-il's cult of personality. The reason was that he had little, an by 1980 virtually no, competition as the heir apparent. The order to do so became unofficially so that North Korean propaganda could claim that there was a spontaneous movement that supported Kim Jong-il. By around 1980, every office and home had the two portraits on display. In the 1980s, the rules on portraits were extended yet again to cover rail and subway carriages. Buses and trams were excluded for unknown reasons. Since the early 1990s, Kim Jong-il portraits have been the same size as those depicting Kim Il-sung, and their display has been standardized so that they are always displayed side-by-side. In the 1990s, a third kind of portrait was added that depicts Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung engaged in discussion about state management. High ranking officials were given yet another portrait, that of Kim Il-sung's first wife and mother of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-suk. Offices, however, do not display this picture. In recent years, the portraits' societal importance has waned.\n\nThe image of Kim Il-sung underwent changes as he aged and according to political currents: early portraits from the 1960s have him in a Mao suit, while those from the 1980s depict him in a Western suit. Years after his death, he began to appear in the military uniform of \"Taewonsu\" (generalissimo). Images of Kim Jong-il, too, went from Mao suit to the \"Taewonsu\" uniform. Under Kim Jong-un, the appearances of the portraits have become increasingly standardized. A portrait of Kim Jong-un was displayed for the first time in public in November 2018 during a visit of Cuban president Miguel Díaz-Canel to Pyongyang.\n\nNorth Korea expert Andrei Lankov notes that the set of rules regarding the portraits changes frequently, making it \"remarkable for its constant fluidity\".\n\nToday, the portraits are can be found everywhere in North Korea. Rules regarding the display and maintenance of the portraits are complex. The portraits should be hung on the most prominent wall of the apartment with nothing else on it, preferably in the living room. They must be kept clean and may not be hung off-center. Any disrespect to the images of the leaders is criminal. This includes not only portraits hung on walls but also e.g. images in newspapers. Damage to the portraits leads to an investigating and, if the suspect is found guilty, punished. A penalty of one day of hard labor at a construction site is reported for failure to properly hang the portraits. The portraits are to be protected even in the case of an emergency. Still, neglecting care for the portraits is considered a rather minor offense, and as such, it is a typical confession that people make during mutual criticism session. Random checks for the portraits are carried out, monthly at least during Kim Il-sung's reign, but the \"inminban\" (neighborhood watch) sometimes tips people off of inspections.\n\nWhen a North Korean changes apparent, he or she must start by hanging the portraits first. The portraits are usually hung on a wall with nothing else, placed high, and looking downwards. Some families bow to the portraits every morning and in the evening, saying greetings, even though bowing to them is not mandatory even in public placers. When a North Korean family mourns a dead member, ceremonial greetings and offerings are made to the deceased, but only after the two portraits have been given the same treatment. The portraits are usually kept clean by adults in the house, typically the mother of the family. They wipe the glass every morning. Sometimes the portraits have a box under them that houses a white cloth used for dusting them that one is not allowed to use for any other purpose.\n\nIn addition to homes, offices, factories, shops, hospitals, classrooms and libraries sport the portraits, as do decks of ships and fronts of trains. In public buildings they are placed above the main entrances. All portraits are made by the Mansudae Art Studio. They are glazed and framed with timber.\n\nStories about North Koreans saving leader portraits from certain destruction have been sported in North Korean media for decades, and they have also been disseminated by the \"inminban\". For instance, in 2007 it was reported that a factory worker rescued his leader portraits and his five-year-old daughter from a flooded house. When he was overpowered by the water, he let go of his daughter but managed to hold onto the portraits. Such a feat can rise the societal status of a person considerably by improving his or her \"songbun\" (ascribed social rank in North Korea). Saving portraits is based on an arbitrary interpretation of the Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System.\n\nIn addition to the standardized portraits, there have been special cases. One of these is a gift from the Syrian Arab Republic, a portrait of Kim Il-sung that is entirely made up of Arabic calligraphy of his work \"The Non-Aligned Movement is a Mighty Anti-Imperialist Revolutionary Force of Our Times\", housed at the International Friendship Exhibition. The largest Kim Il-sung portrait, at least in Pyongyang, was 15 by 11 meters and was hung at the Pyongyang Department Store No. 1 in the 1990s.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2535885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2535885", "title": "Latchkey kid", "text": "Latchkey kid\n\nA latchkey kid, or latchkey child, is a child who returns from school to an empty home, or a child who is often left at home with little parental supervision, because their parent or parents are away at work.\n\nThe term refers to the latchkey of a door to a house. The key is often strung around the child's neck or left hidden under a mat (or some other object) at the rear door to the property. The term seems to first appear in a CBC radio program called \"Discussion Club – Topic: How War Affects Canadian Children\" in 1942, due to the phenomenon of children being left home alone during World War II, when the father would be enlisted into the armed forces and the mother would need to get a job. Given that the \"Discussion Club\" participants are all familiar with the term and allude to it being in colloquial usage, it likely predates 1942. In general, the term latchkey designates \"those children between the ages of five and thirteen who care for themselves after the school day until their parents or guardians return home\".\n\nMore specifically for their purposes, the San Marino (CA) Public Library has defined a Library Latchkey Child as \"one who on a regular basis is required by their parents or guardian to remain at the public library for extended periods of time after school in lieu of day care. 'Regular basis' is defined as three or more days per week. 'Extended period' is defined as two or more hours per day\" (American Library Association 12).\n\nThe term latchkey kid became commonplace to describe members of Generation X, who according to a 2004 marketing study, \"went through its all-important, formative years as one of the least parented, least nurtured generations in U.S. history.\" Latchkey kids were prevalent during this time, a result of increased divorce rates and increased maternal participation in the workforce, at a time before childcare options outside the home were widely available. These latchkey children, referred to as \"day orphans\" in the 1984 documentary, \"To Save Our Children to Save Our Schools\", mainly came from middle or upper-class homes. The higher the educational attainment of the parents, the higher the odds the children of this time would be latchkey kids.\n\nThe effects of being a latchkey child differ with age. Loneliness, boredom and fear are most common for those younger than 10 years of age. In the early teens, there is a greater susceptibility to peer pressure, potentially resulting in such behaviors as alcohol abuse, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity and smoking. The behaviors might stem from \"unspent energy, peer pressure to misbehave, or hostility because of the lack of appropriate adult attention\". However, some children experience positive effects, such as an early development of self-reliance, adaptation to difficult situations, and a desire to contribute to a visible need in the household.\n\nSocioeconomic status and length of time left alone can bring forth other negative effects. In one study, middle school students left home alone for more than three hours a day reported higher levels of behavioral problems, higher rates of depression, and lower levels of self-esteem than other students.\n\nChildren from lower income families are associated with greater externalizing issues (such as conduct disorders and hyperactivity) and academic problems. This association was weaker for children from middle income families as compared to their supervised peers. In 2000, a German PISA study found no significant differences in the scholastic performance between \"latchkey kids\" and kids in a \"nuclear family\".\n\nPositive effects of being a latchkey child include independence and self-reliance at a young age. Deborah Belle, author of \"The After-School Lives of Children: Alone and with Others While Parents Work\" suggests that being left home alone may be a better alternative to staying with baby-sitters or older siblings.\n\nThe legality of the latchkey children's \"alone time\" varies with country, state and local area. In the United States, state and local laws typically do not specify any particular age under 18 when a child can be legally left without supervision. However, some states do have specific age restrictions.\n\nParents can be held accountable by child welfare, child protective services organizations, or law enforcement if children come to harm while left without supervision if, in the opinion of the agency, the children's age or other considerations made such a choice inappropriate. Legal issues also continue to be important concerns for those who work in libraries. They worry about the potential liability should an unattended child be hurt, molested or abducted while at the facility. This issue becomes critical, particularly at closing time when \"parents who are late picking up their children also create safety and possibly legal problems.\"\n\nSome communities offer services through the police departments and community organizations to check in on latchkey kids. Calls can be made by community organizations or by volunteers. Automatic calling programs such as Call Reassurance call households during the week after children arrive home and require the child to answer the phone and positively acknowledge that he or she is okay. If the call is not answered, automatic calls can likewise be sent to the parents, police, or other response centers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6975086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6975086", "title": "Metelkova", "text": "Metelkova\n\nMetelkova (full name in , \"Metelkova City Autonomous Cultural Center\", referred to by the acronym AKC) is an autonomous social and cultural centre in the city centre of Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital city. Formerly, the site was a military headquarter of the Army of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, then it became the Slovenian headquarter of the Yugoslav National Army. It consists of seven buildings (military barracks) extended over a total area of 12,500 m², which have been squatted since September 1993. The squat is named after nearby Metelko Street (Slovene: Metelkova ulica), which is named after the 19th-century Slovenian Roman Catholic priest, philologist, and unsuccessful language reformer Fran Metelko.\n\nThe contested history of Metelkova as a squat begins on June 25, 1991 with the Slovenian and Croatian declaration of independence. This date is considered one of many that mark the end of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the dissolution of Yugoslavia in that year, the Yugoslavian Army left Metelkova, which shortly became a military brownfield with its leftover barracks.\n\nIn 1991 the Network for Metelkova, composed of more than 200 alternative and youth organizations, asked the municipality of Ljubljana for permission to use those barracks for peaceful and creative purposes. As a response, Ljubliana autorities gave the Network for Metelkova formal permission to stay and use the site. Nevertheless, those promises given by the municipality were never really maintained. This example on the request for permission demonstrates the ambiguous role of the municipality of Ljubliana towards the Network for Metelkova, in which the municipality seems to allow them to stay there, but in fact she doesn’t want them to stay.\n\nThis ambiguous role of the municipality of Ljubljana in regard to Metelkova and its Network has remained over the years. In 1993 the cultural center became a squat when a commissioner mandated the demolition of some barracks that were promised to the Network, with the aim of illegally reconverting the area into a commercial site. At that time, Metelkova came into being as an illegal occupation (a squat) and was redefined as a self-organized autonomous zone in 1995.\n\nSince then, the center has been a site of tolerance of minorities, even though it is still threatened by the bad treatment it receives by the city and the Slovene state.\n\nAnother example of the ambiguity in state and municipality actions towards the Network for Metelkova and Metelkova itself are the subsidies from Ljubljana’s city administration for the construction of a little summer lodge also known as the Small School (from the Slovene: Mala Šola). Nevertheless, the lodge, planned and constructed in 2001 by volunteers, was immediately defined as abusive. In fact, the construction was followed by the request of its demolition, right after another municipal office reported it to the State Inspectorate for the Environment and Spatial Planning. After several failed attempts, the building was demolished on August 2, 2006. Although there are plans to rebuild the building, it has not been reconstructed since then.\n\nIn the 2000s, new actors became involved in the Metelkova autonomous zone, for example the LGBT community, other non-governmental organizations and even UNESCO. Although it did not help Metelkova to receive proper legal status, the area was recognized as a national cultural heritage back in 2005.\n\nIn September 1991 the Network for Metelkova was born, merging the Movement for the Culture of Peace and Nonviolence and The Student Cultural Centre Association. When, in 1993, the Metelkova declared its independency from the communal possession, a group of young activists occupied the site. From 1993 onwards, the site has been occupied, in a declared illegal way, mainly by artists, activists and young students, organising a rich agenda of cultural activities. Nowadays, many artists have their own ateliers in Metelkova and some NGOs and LGBT associations have their offices there. Art exhibitions, performances, concerts and engaged activities have taken place in the buildings of Metelkova.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the identity of the site has changed. The district is increasingly attracting more and more tourists and the building are increasingly transformed into shops, bars and clubs. In Metelkova, the cultural aspect is visible during the day, but the atmosphere is different during the night, with music and parties.\n\nAt Metelkova a range of cultural and artistic activities take place in a multiple range of sites. Those include, for example, art galleries, bars, artists’ studios, locals for designers, offices of cultural organizations and concert halls featuring different types of live music from Free Jazz, Rockabilly, Psychobilly, Punk rock, Heavy metal and Noise to Dub and Techno. Thanks to those activities which attract a lot of tourists and the young population of Ljubljana, the money needed to pay for public utilities is raised through Metelkova's many bars, concerts, and art galleries.\n\nThe development of the Metelkova “brand” as an alternative place can be seen as another reason that can explain the existence of Metelkova: in fact, the municipality of Ljubjlana sees the presence of a space of this type in a rather positive way because it attracts a large number of tourists and contributes to the promotion of the Slovenian capital in the world.\n\nOver the last few years Metelkova, like Christiania in Copenhagen, has been the subject of several studies and reflections on the phenomenon of squatting and on living with different laws and institutions that surround it. These districts mentioned above can be defined as heterotopic spaces since they have been present for decades in parallel to the cities of which they are legally part. Nevertheless, they are characterized by a particular relationship with the authorities of their cities in comparison to other districts.\nNowadays, it can be said that there are three different areas in Metelkova: one part is defined by art and social life, the second by civil engagement and the third is commercial; the squatters act in all three areas mentioned. Metelkova's differentiation into three possible sub-entities can be seen through the arrival of different institutional actors in the neighbourhood, such as the Museum of Contemporary Art, different NGOs and different commercial activities, such as the Hotel Celica, which reuses some of the areas of the old barracks.\n\nSquatters represent the heart of the matter of legality and formality in Metelkova: the autonomous part is considered to be in a legal and administrative limbo defined through tolerance and legitimization toward city's authority. A possible explanation for this situation is to be found in the nature of the squatting in Metelkova: in fact the old buildings of the Yugoslav army are not occupied for the sole purpose of living there, but also for the aim of producing culture. From this perspective, it is possible to determine the beginning of the tolerance: since 1997, when Ljubljana was designated as the European Capital of Culture, Metelkova stopped hosting permanent residents, following an agreement reached with the municipality, whereby the city decided to dedicate the Metelkova buildings to the promotion of culture and art.\n\nFinally, the example of Metelkova can be related to the concept of informality in order to explain the situation: at its very first beginning, Metelkova could be considered as completely informal since the occupation of the military warehouse by the squatters was considered illegal and not rules- and code-compliant. Nowadays the situation has slightly changed: the city of Ljubjlana is now linked to the Metelkova’s site, for example thanks to the presence of different institutional actors. It is therefore possible to assume that the situation is constantly changing and that a part of Metelkova is actually normalized and institutionalized, despite the fact that the type of culture and urban development is still not compliant with building codes and urban planning regulation.\n\nIn 2005, Metelkova was declared a national cultural heritage site, prevented from being part of an alternative economic development and from attempts for densification and rehabilitation of the sector through urban planning. Moreover, the European Cultural Fund attributes financial support to Metelkova.\n\nThis general national and international interest in Metelkova represents a sort of insurance for Metelkova’s durability. Besides, it can support the economy of Ljubljana in a context where culture adds value to cities and contributes to cities’ regeneration. For example, Metelkova on its own is said to contribute for 40% of all the music concerts in Ljubljana.\n\nMetelkova is defined as a self-managed and well-organized community. There is no legal status for the site, and the type of urbanism we can find is informal. For example, residents of Metelkova initially illegally siphoned water from Ljubljana. However, today Metelkova is legally connected to the city's water system and power grid. Metelkova is considered as a squat and there is not a clear position of the political parties about the legitimacy of the cultural hub. This paradox around Metelkova makes it difficult to imagine future decisions, especially because military brownfields are good places for urban densification and rehabilitation through urban planning. In fact, in the last decades, theories about urban densification replaced urban sprawl. What could that mean for Metelkova? Does the cultural aspect overlaps environmental and social ones? This kind of cultural, alternative zones are also places where gentrification dynamisms and processes begin. Besides, some associations that defend feminism and LGBT communities are located in Metelkova. That is the reason why there are some attacks from neo-Nazi and skinhead groups. Those attempts of extremist groups add up to the uncertain future of Metelkova.\n\nHowever, Metelkova is known to be a cultural center in Slovenia and in Europe as it attracts many tourists. That may encourage Ljubljana’s authorities to preserve its unique characteristics in order to maintain international visibility in a global cultural context. This may represent a crucial stake in a period when culture is becoming more and more a business rather than an activist, alternative, independent way of living.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15678352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15678352", "title": "New Zealand art", "text": "New Zealand art\n\nNew Zealand art consists of the visual and plastic arts (including architecture, woodwork, textiles, and ceramics) originating from New Zealand. It comes from different traditions: indigenous Māori art, that of the early European (or Pākehā) settlers, and later immigrants from Pacific, Asian, and European countries. Owing to New Zealand's geographic isolation, in the past many artists had to leave home in order to make a living. The visual arts flourished in the latter decades of the 20th century as many New Zealanders became more culturally sophisticated.\n\nCharcoal drawings can be found on limestone rock shelters in the centre of the South Island, with over 500 sites stretching from Kaikoura to North Otago. The drawings are estimated to be between 500 and 800 years old, and portray animals, people and fantastic creatures, possibly stylised reptiles. Some of the birds pictured are extinct, including moa and Haast's eagles. They were drawn by early Māori, but by the time Europeans arrived, local inhabitants did not know the origins of the drawings.\n\nMāori visual art consists primarily of four forms: carving, tattooing (\"ta moko\"), weaving, and painting. It was rare for any of these to be purely decorative; traditional Māori art was highly spiritual and in a pre-literate society conveyed information about spiritual matters, ancestry, and other culturally important topics. The creation of art was governed by the rules of tapu. Styles varied from region to region: the style now sometimes seen as 'typical' in fact originates from Te Arawa, who maintained a strong continuity in their artistic traditions thanks partly to early engagement with the tourist industry. Most traditional Māori art was highly stylised and featured motifs such as the spiral, the chevron and the koru. The colours black, white and red dominated.\n\nCarving was done in three media: wood, bone, and stone. Arguably ta moko was another form of carving. Wood carvings were used to decorate houses, fencepoles, containers, taiaha and other objects. The most popular type of stone used in carving was pounamu (greenstone), a form of jade, but other kinds were also used, especially in the North Island, where pounamu was not widely available. Both stone and bone were used to create jewellery such as the hei-tiki. Large scale stone face carvings were also sometimes created. The introduction of metal tools by Europeans allowed more intricacy and delicacy, and caused stone and bone fish hooks and other tools to become purely decorative. Carving is traditionally a tapu activity performed by men only.\n\nTa moko is the art of traditional Māori tattooing, done with a chisel. Men were tattooed on many parts of their bodies, including faces, buttocks and thighs. Women were usually tattooed only on the lips and chin. Moko conveyed a person's ancestry. The art declined in the 19th century following the introduction of Christianity, but in recent decades has undergone a revival. Although modern moko are in traditional styles, most are carried out using modern equipment. Body parts such as the arms, legs and back are popular locations for modern moko, although some are still on the face.\n\nWeaving was used to create numerous things, including wall panels in meeting houses and other important buildings, as well as clothing and bags (kete). While many of these were purely functional, others were true works of art taking hundreds of hours to complete, and often given as gifts to important people. Cloaks in particular could be decorated with feathers and were the mark of an important chief. In pre-European times the main medium for weaving was flax, but following the arrival of Europeans cotton, wool and other textiles were also used, especially in clothing. The extinction and endangerment of many New Zealand birds has made the feather cloak a more difficult item to produce. Weaving was primarily done by women.\n\nAlthough the oldest forms of Māori art are rock paintings, in 'classical' Māori art, painting was not an important art form. It was mainly used as a minor decoration in meeting houses, in stylised forms such as the koru. Europeans introduced Māori to their more figurative style of art, and in the 19th century less stylised depictions of people and plants began to appear on the walls of meeting houses in place of traditional carvings and woven panels. The introduction of European paints also allowed traditional painting to flourish, as brighter and more distinct colours could be produced.\n\nEuropeans began producing art in New Zealand as soon as they arrived, with many exploration ships including an artist to record newly discovered places, people, flora and fauna. The first European work of art made in New Zealand was a drawing by Isaac Gilsemans, the artist on Abel Tasman's expedition of 1642.\nSir Joseph Banks and Sydney Parkinson of Captain James Cook's ship Endeavour produced the first realistic depictions of Māori people, New Zealand landscapes, and indigenous flora and fauna in 1769. William Hodges was the artist on HMS Resolution in 1773, and John Webber on HMS Resolution in 1777. Their works captured the imagination of Europeans and were an influence in the 19th century movement of art towards naturalism.\n\nCook's artists' paintings and descriptions of moko sparked an interest in the subject in Europe, and led to the tattoo becoming a tradition of the British Navy.\n\nEarly 19th-century artists were for the most part visitors to New Zealand, not residents. Some, such as James Barry, who painted the Ngare Raumati chief Rua in 1818, and Thomas Kendall with the chiefs Hongi Hika and Waikato in 1820, did not visit New Zealand at all, instead painting his subjects when they visited Britain.\n\nLandscape art was popular with early colonisers, and prints were widely used to promote settlement in New Zealand. Notable landscape artists included Augustus Earle, who visited New Zealand in 1827-28, and William Fox, who later became Premier. The first oil portraits of Māori Chiefs with full Tā moko in New Zealand were painted by the portrait artist William Beetham. As colonisation developed a small but derivative art scene began based mostly on landscapes. However the most successful artists of this period, Charles Goldie and Gottfried Lindauer were noted primarily for their portraits of Māori. Most notable Pākehā artists of their period worked in two dimensions; although there was some sculpture this was of limited notability.\n\nPhotography in New Zealand also began at this time and, like painting, initially concentrated mostly on landscape and Māori subjects.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, many Pākehā (New Zealanders not of Maori origin, usually of European ancestry) attempted to create a distinctive New Zealand style of art. Many, such as Rita Angus, continued to work on landscapes, with attempts made to depict New Zealand's harsh light. Others appropriate Māori artistic styles; for example Gordon Walters created many paintings and prints based on the koru. New Zealand's most highly regarded 20th-century artist was Colin McCahon, who attempted to use international styles such as cubism in New Zealand contexts. His paintings depicted such things as the Angel Gabriel in the New Zealand countryside. Later works such as the Urewera triptych engaged with the contemporary Māori protest movement.\n\nFrom the early 20th century, politician Āpirana Ngata fostered a renewal of traditional Māori art forms, for example establishing a school of Māori arts in Rotorua.\n\nThe visual arts flourished in the later decades of the 20th century, with the increased cultural sophistication of many New Zealanders. Many Māori artists became highly successful blending elements of Māori culture with European modernism. Ralph Hotere was New Zealand's highest selling living artist, but other such as Shane Cotton and Michael Parekowhai are also very successful. Many contemporary Maori artists reference ancient myths and cultural practices in their work such as Derek Lardelli, Lisa Reihana, Sofia Minson, Te Rongo Kirkwood, Robyn Kahukiwa, Aaron Kereopa, Rangi Kipa, John Miller, Kura Te Waru Rewiri, Tracey Tawhiao, Roi Toia, Shane Hansen, John Bevan Ford, Jennifer Rendall, Todd Couper, Manos Nathan, Wayne Youle, Lyonel Grant, Wi Taepa and David Teata.\n\nCreative New Zealand is the national agency for the development of the arts in New Zealand.\n\nThe National Art Gallery of New Zealand was established in 1936, and was amalgamated into the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in 1992. The Auckland Art Gallery is New Zealand's largest art institution with a collection numbering over 15,000 works, including major holdings of New Zealand historic, modern and contemporary art, and outstanding works by Māori and Pacific Island artists.\n\nNew Zealand has three university-based fine art schools: Elam School of Fine Arts at the University of Auckland was founded in 1890, the University of Canterbury school of fine arts founded in 1950 and Massey School of Fine Arts founded in 1885, but was not officially a university institution until 2000. There are also several other tertiary level fine arts schools not affiliated to universities.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32754049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32754049", "title": "PASS theory of intelligence", "text": "PASS theory of intelligence\n\nThe Planning, Attention-Arousal, Simultaneous and Successive (PASS) theory of intelligence, first proposed in 1975 (Das, Kirby, and Jarman,1975), and later elaborated by Das, Naglieri & Kirby (1994) and Das, Kar & Parrila, (1996) challenges g-theory on the grounds that the brain is made up of interdependent, but separate, functional systems. Neuroimaging studies and clinical studies of individuals with brain lesions make it clear that the brain is modularized; for example, damage to a very specific area of the left temporal lobe will impair the production (but not the comprehension) of spoken and written language. Damage to an adjacent area will have the opposite impact, preserving the individual's ability to produce, but not understand speech and text.\n\nBased on A. R. Luria's (1966) work on modularization of brain function, and supported by decades of neuroimaging research, the PASS Theory of Intelligence proposes that cognition is organized in three systems and four processes. The first process is Planning, which involves executive functions responsible for controlling and organizing behavior, selecting and constructing strategies, and monitoring performance. The second is the Attention process, responsible for maintaining arousal levels and alertness, and ensuring focus on relevant stimuli. The two processes, Simultaneous Processing and Successive Processing encode, transform, and retain information. Simultaneous processing is engaged for determination of the relationship between items integration into whole units of information is required. Examples of this include recognizing figures, such as a triangle within a circle vs. a circle within a triangle. Successive processing is required for organizing separate items in a sequence such as remembering a sequence of words or actions exactly in the order in which they had just been presented. These four processes are hypothesized to functions of four areas of the brain. Planning is broadly located in the front part of our brains, the frontal lobe. Attention and arousal are combined functions of the frontal lobe and the lower parts of the cortex, although the parietal lobes are also involved in attention as well. Simultaneous processing and Successive processing occur in the posterior region or the back of the brain. Simultaneous processing is broadly associated with the occipital and the parietal lobes while Successive processing is broadly associated with the frontal-temporal lobes. The PASS (Planning/Attention/Simultaneous/Successive) theory is heavily indebted to both Luria (1966, 1973), and studies in cognitive psychology involved in promoting a different look at intelligence.\n\nThe PASS theory provides the theoretical framework for a measurement instrument called the Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System (CAS), published in 1997. This test is designed to provide a nuanced assessment of the individual's intellectual functioning, providing information about cognitive strengths and weaknesses in each of the four processes. This emphasis on processes (rather than abilities) is said to make it useful for differential diagnosis; unlike traditional full-scale IQ tests, the PASS is capable of diagnosing Learning disabilities and Attention Deficit Disorder, Autism, Mental Retardation, cognitive changes in aging and Down syndrome, and more recently changes due to brain impairment in Stroke. Its usefulness as a theory and measurement instrument for Planning and Decision making in management has also been demonstrated.\n\nContemporary theories about intelligence can be divided into two classes, psychometric and cognitive. The quantitative approach to intelligence is better reflected in psychometric theories of which Charles Spearman's is an early example. In contrast, cognitive theories such as PASS theory are both qualitative and quantitative. Such theories advance the idea that intelligence has multiple categories. For example, both Robert Sternberg and Howard Gardner view intelligence as neither a single nor biologically determined factor, but as a number of domains that represent the interaction of the individual's biological predispositions with the environment and cultural context. PASS theory builds upon these principles.\n\nIt is useful to link PASS processes to the brain. The core ideas that cognitive functions can be organized in terms of broad functions of the brain received some support in a recent study (Okuhata et al.) that investigated the psychophysiological basis of two different types of information processing (simultaneous and successive). The authors, investigated EEG coherence patterns during six tasks of Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System. They analyzed beta (12.5 – 25 Hz) coherence while 18 volunteers performed three simultaneous and three successive tasks. The results revealed two significantly distinguishable coherence patterns corresponding to simultaneous and successive processing. The linking of PASS processes to brain becomes helpful, for example, in understanding the loss of sequential and planning functions due to aging in a study of individuals with Down syndrome. In this study, using single positron emission topography, Das found that aging individuals with Down syndrome show a bilateral decreased cerebral blood flow in the temporal-parietal region of the brain. The significance of cognitive profiling studies both in impaired and intact brains awaits further discussion in the broader context of the biology of intelligence.\n\nOne unusual property of the PASS theory of cognitive processes is that it has proven useful for both intellectual assessment (e.g. the CAS) and educational intervention. The theory provides the theoretical framework for the PASS Reading Enhancement Programme (PREP), a remediation curriculum designed to improve the planning, attention and information processing strategies that underlie reading . A related school-readiness program aims at improving the foundations of cognitive processes(COGENT) in preparation for schooling (Das, 2009). Both are evidence-based intervention programs.\n\nA frequently cited criticism is based on the factor analysis of the test battery. In particular, are Attention and Planning two distinct factors? Kranzler, Keith & Flanagan (2000) found only a marginal fit for the four-factor model ; the attention and planning factors were indistinguishable. However the usefulness of considering planning and attention as separate constructs in distinguishing clinical groups, as well as in application of Planning apart from Attention in management decision making has not been questioned. \n\nFurther tests that measure mainly attention such as vigilance, and tests that include strategies and higher levels of planning are necessary . The criticism of CAS measures cannot be repudiated until such additions have been made. . \n\n"}

The technique is used to make belts, sandals, hair bands, saddles, and other leather accessories. The technique is popular in Mexico and Central America, and typical designs include flowers, animals, charreada, and Pre-Hispanic symbols.\n\nJalisco, a Mexican State was famous for this type of handicraft, especially the town of Colotlan. This region has become a big producer of two kinds of non-traditional piteado industry. One which uses automated manufacturing embroidery machines to make imitation piteado products and one where non-precious silvery and golden wires are inserted in leather works which are then fraudulently traded as genuine gold and silver.\n\nThe piteado work is a traditional art craft made by hand used in some Mexican Folklore, and has spread to several communities in other Mexican states, including Hidalgo, Guerrero, Veracruz, San Luis Potosi, State of Mexico, Durango, Zacatecas, Guerrero, Michoacán, and Chiapas.\n\nColotlán a town of Jalisco call itself piteado global capital, because there are many saddlers shops, and piteado dedicated craftsmen as a main source of income for its inhabitants. Each one of those piteado-workshop employs three types of workers, each dedicated to a specialized task: drawers, embroiderers, and \"punteadores\". There is an annual fair in promotion of local piteado artisan's art.\n\nHand embroidering a belt requires about 48 hours of labor. The kind of cactus thread used to embroidery is produced in Veracruz, Chiapas, and Oaxaca. \nArtisans from those regions make well-finished and more elaborate piteado works, but because of the lack of advertising and promotion, it is often not possible for them to sell to their intended market.\n\nThere is a foundation which promotes piteado in Veracruz, with branches in Florida and Shanghai, which embraces, supports, and makes contributions of machinery and equipment to communities of artisans. This organization also encourages scientific research to improve the plant from which the cactus fiber is obtained, bringing together the communities involved. They connect farmers from northern Oaxaca with biochemical and agricultural researchers in the Guatemalan region of Mesaltenango, supporting the experimental designs of some new products, giving resources and support to those potential artisans with great innovative creations, and continuing to preserve these natural non-renewable resources. The group encourages the improvement of the process of manufacturing some traditional products already on the market, the continued propagation of the art form, and the preservation of the history behind it.\n"}

{"id": "15850780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15850780", "title": "Religion in Cambodia", "text": "Religion in Cambodia\n\nBuddhism is the official religion of Cambodia. Approximately 97% of Cambodia's population follows Theravada Buddhism, with Islam, Christianity, and tribal animism making up the bulk of the remainder. The \"wat\" (Buddhist monastery) and \"Sangha\" (monkhood), together with essential Buddhist doctrines such as reincarnation and the accumulation of merit, are at the centre of religious life, but interact with indigenous beliefs such as the central role of ancestors and spirits.\n\nBuddhism has existed in Cambodia since at least the 5th century AD, with some sources placing its origin as early as the 3rd century BC. Theravada Buddhism has been the Cambodian state religion since the 13th century AD (excepting the Khmer Rouge period), and is currently estimated to be the religion of 97% of the population.\n\nThe history of Buddhism in Cambodia spans nearly two thousand years, across a number of successive kingdoms and empires. Buddhism entered Cambodia through two different streams. The earliest forms of Buddhism, along with Hindu influences, entered the Funan kingdom with Hindu merchants. In later history, a second stream of Buddhism entered Khmer culture during the Angkor empire when Cambodia absorbed the various Buddhist traditions of the Mon kingdoms of Dvaravati and Haripunchai.\n\nFor the first thousand years of Khmer history, Cambodia was ruled by a series of Hindu kings with an occasional Buddhist king, such as Jayavarman I of Funan, and Suryvarman I. A variety of Buddhist traditions co-existed peacefully throughout Cambodian lands, under the tolerant auspices of Hindu kings and the neighboring Mon-Theravada kingdoms.\n\nCambodia was first influenced by Hinduism during the beginning of the Kingdom of Funan. Hinduism was one of the Khmer Empire's official religions. Cambodia is the home to one of the only two temples dedicated to Brahma in the world. Angkor Wat of Cambodia is the largest Hindu temple of the world.\n\nIslam is the religion of a majority of the Cham and Malay minorities in Cambodia. According to Po Dharma, there were 150,000 to 200,000 Muslims in Cambodia as late as 1975 while Ben Kiernan's research documents numbers as high as 250,000. Persecution under the Khmer Rouge eroded their numbers, however, and by the late 1980s they probably had not regained their former strength. All of the Cham Muslims are Sunnis of the Shafi'i school. Po Dharma divides the Muslim Cham in Cambodia into a traditionalist branch and an orthodox branch.\n\nThe Cham have their own mosques. In 1962 there were about 100 mosques in the country. At the end of the nineteenth century, the Muslims in Cambodia formed a unified community under the authority of four religious dignitaries—mupti, tuk kalih, raja kalik, and tvan pake. A council of notables in Cham villages consisted of one hakem and several katip, bilal, and labi. The four high dignitaries and the hakem were exempt from personal taxes, and they were invited to take part in major national ceremonies at the royal court. When Cambodia became independent, the Islamic community was placed under the control of a five-member council that represented the community in official functions and in contacts with other Islamic communities. Each Muslim community has a hakem who leads the community and the mosque, an imam who leads the prayers, and a bilal who calls the faithful to the daily prayers. The peninsula of Chrouy Changvar near Phnom Penh is considered the spiritual center of the Cham, and several high Muslim officials reside there. Each year some of the Cham go to study the Qur'an at Kelantan in Malaysia, and some go on to study in, or make a pilgrimage to, Mecca. According to figures from the late 1950s, about seven percent of the Cham had completed the pilgrimage and could wear the fez or turban as a sign of their accomplishment.\n\nThe first known Christian mission in Cambodia was undertaken by Gaspar da Cruz, a Portuguese member of the Dominican Order, in 1555-1556. According to his own account, the enterprise was a complete failure; he found the country run by a \"Bramene\" king and \"Bramene\" officials, and discovered that \"the Bramenes are the most difficult people to convert\". He felt that no one would dare to convert without the King's permission, and left the country in disappointment, not having \"baptized more than one gentile whom I left in the grave\".\n\nDespite the French colonization in the 19th century, Christianity made little impact in the country. In 1972 there were probably about 20,000 Christians in Cambodia, most of whom were Roman Catholics. Before the repatriation of the Vietnamese in 1970 and 1971, possibly as many as 62,000 Christians lived in Cambodia. According to Vatican statistics, in 1953, members of the Roman Catholic Church in Cambodia numbered 120,000, making it at the time, the second largest religion; estimates indicate that about 50,000 Catholics were Vietnamese. Many of the Catholics remaining in Cambodia in 1972 were Europeans – chiefly French; and still, among Catholic Cambodians are whites and Eurasians of French descent. Steinberg reported, also in 1953, that an American Unitarian mission maintained a teacher-training school in Phnom Penh, and Baptist missions functioned in Battambang and Siem Reap provinces. A Christian and Missionary Alliance mission was founded in Cambodia in 1923; by 1962 the mission had converted about 2,000 people.\n\nAmerican Protestant missionary activity increased in Cambodia, especially among some of the hill tribes and among the Cham, after the establishment of the Khmer Republic. The 1962 census, which reported 2,000 Protestants in Cambodia, remains the most recent statistic for the group. In 1982 French geographer Jean Delvert reported that three Christian villages existed in Cambodia, but he gave no indication of the size, location, or type of any of them. Observers reported that in 1980 there were more registered Khmer Christians among the refugees in camps in Thailand than in all of Cambodia before 1970. Kiernan notes that, until June 1980, five weekly Protestant services were held in Phnom Penh by a Khmer pastor, but that they had been reduced to a weekly service after police harassment. His estimates suggest that in 1987 the Christian community in Cambodia had shrunk to only a few thousand members.\n\nVarious Protestant denominations have reported marked growth since the 1990s, and by some current estimates Christians make up 2-3% of Cambodia's population.\n\nThere are around 20,000 Catholics in Cambodia which represents 0.15% of the total population. There are no dioceses, but there are three territorial jurisdictions - one Apostolic Vicariate and two Apostolic Prefectures. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as the Mormons) has a growing population in Cambodia. The church's president, Gordon B. Hinckley, officially introduced missionary work to Cambodia on May 29, 1996. The church now has 31 congregations (27 Khmer language and three Vietnamese language, and one international).\n\nThe introduction of the Bahá'í Faith in Cambodia first occurred in 1920, with the arrival of Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney in Phnom Penh at the behest of 'Abdu'l-Bahá. After sporadic visits from travelling teachers throughout the first half of the 20th century, the first Bahá'i group in Cambodia was established in that city in 1956. By 1963, Bahá'ís were known to reside in Phnom Penh, Battambang, Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, with a functioning Spiritual Assembly present in Phnom Penh.\n\nDuring the rule of the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s, the Bahá'ís of Cambodia became isolated from the outside world. Many of them joined with the flood of refugees that dispersed around the world following the fall of the Khmer Rouge, resettling in places such as Canada and the United States, where special efforts were made to contact them and incorporate them into local Bahá'í community life. Bahá'ís in Thailand and other countries reached out to the Cambodian refugees living in camps on the Thai-Cambodian border; this eventually led to the growth of Bahá'í communities there, including the establishment of Spiritual Assemblies.\n\nThe Bahá'í community has recently seen a return to growth, especially in the city of Battambang. The city hosted one of 41 Bahá'í regional conferences worldwide in 2009, which attracted over 2,000 participants. Two regional youth conferences occurred in Cambodia in 2013, including one in Battambang and one in Kampong Thom. In 2012, the Universal House of Justice announced plans to establish a local Bahá'í House of Worship in Battambang. Its design was unveiled in July 2015, with the groundbreaking following in November. The House of Worship—the first Bahá'í House of Worship to serve a single locality—was dedicated in a ceremony in September 2017, attended by 2,500 people.\n\nAccording to a 2010 estimate, Cambodia is home to approximately 10,000 Bahá'ís.\n\nHighland tribal groups, most with their own local religious systems, include approximately 150,000 people. The Khmer Loeu have been loosely described as animists, but most indigenous ethnic groups have their own pantheon of local spirits. In general they see their world filled with various invisible spirits (often called \"yang\"), some benevolent, others malevolent. They associate spirits with rice, soil, water, fire, stones, paths, and so forth. Shamans, sorcerers or specialists in each village contact these spirits and prescribe ways to appease them. In times of crisis or change, animal sacrifices may be made to placate the anger of the spirits. Illness is often believed to be caused by evil spirits or sorcerers. Some tribes have special medicine men or shamans who treat the sick. In addition to belief in spirits, villagers believe in taboos on many objects or practices. Among the Khmer Loeu, the Austronesian groups (Rhade and Jarai) have a well-developed hierarchy of spirits with a supreme ruler at its head.\n\nThere is a small Jewish community in Cambodia consisting of a little over 100 people. Since 2009, there has been a Chabad house in Phnom Penh.\n"}

SpongeBob and his friends have to stop him, defeat his robot minions and family members, retrieve the batteries, and find the three keys before he does to get the formula back. They fight Plankton in the Dutchman's Triangle, but he retreats. The team then fight two of Plankton's family members, who also have giant robots, in other areas. After getting the first two keys and batteries, they go back to the Krusty Krab and battle Plankton again. After he is defeated, they retrieve the last battery and find the last key under the doormat and use it to open the safe. In the bottle was a note saying the formula is in Mr. Krabs' pocket the whole time. Squidward expresses his shock that they have been through the whole thing for nothing. That night, when SpongeBob and Patrick are watching TV in Patrick's house, SpongeBob wonders where the batteries went and is amazed that Patrick's TV is working so well. It is then revealed that the batteries were powering the TV from the outside.\n\nThe game was announced in March 2013 after THQ shutdown following its file for bankruptcy and liquidation in 2012. A trailer for the game was released in July 2013.\n\nIGN panned the game with a score of 3.5 out of 10. Both \"PlayStation Official Magazine\" and \"Official PlayStation Magazine\" awarded the game a 5/10. GamingBolt rated the game 7 out of 10.\n"}

{"id": "20303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20303", "title": "The Muppets", "text": "The Muppets\n\nThe Muppets are an ensemble cast of puppet characters known for their self-aware, burlesque, and meta-referential style of variety-sketch comedy. Created by Jim and Jane Henson in 1955, they are the namesake for the Disney media franchise that encompasses television, music, film, and other media associated with the characters.\n\nThe Muppets originated in the short-form television series \"Sam and Friends\", which aired from 1955 to 1961. Following appearances on late night talk shows and in advertising during the 1960s, the Muppets began appearing on \"Sesame Street\" in 1969. The Muppets attained celebrity status and international recognition through their breakout roles in \"The Muppet Show\" (1976–1981), a primetime television series that garnered four Primetime Emmy Award wins and twenty-one nominations during its five-year run. \n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Muppets diversified into theatrical feature films, including \"The Muppet Movie\" (1979); \"The Great Muppet Caper\" (1981); and \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\" (1984). The Walt Disney Company began involvement with the Muppets in the late 1980s, during which Henson entered negotiations to sell the Jim Henson Company. The Muppets continued their media presence in the 1990s with television series \"The Jim Henson Hour\" (1989) and \"Muppets Tonight\" (1996–98), both of which were similar in format to \"The Muppet Show\", and three films: \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" (1992), \"Muppet Treasure Island\" (1996), and \"Muppets from Space\" (1999). \n\nDisney acquired the Muppets in February 2004, allowing the characters to gain broader public exposure than in previous years. Under Disney, the Muppets achieved revitalized success, starring in two films - \"The Muppets\" (2011) and \"Muppets Most Wanted\" (2014) - as well as a short-lived primetime television series on ABC and a reboot of the \"Muppet Babies\" animated series.\n\nThroughout their six-decade career, the Muppets have been regarded as a staple of the entertainment industry and popular culture in the United States, receiving recognition from various cultural institutions and organizations, including the American Film Institute, Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, Library of Congress, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nThe Muppets were created by puppeteer Jim Henson in the 1950s, beginning with Kermit the Frog, who would become Henson's most recognizable character. Originally conceived for an adult audience, Henson claimed, and later retracted, that he coined the term \"Muppet\" as a portmanteau of the words \"marionette\" and \"puppet\". In 1955, the Muppets were introduced in \"Sam and Friends\", a short-form television series produced for WRC-TV in Washington D.C. Developed by Henson and eventual wife Jane Nebel, the series was notable for being the first form of puppet media not to incorporate a physical proscenium arch within which the characters are presented, relying instead on the natural framing of the television set through which the program was viewed.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the characters—in particular, Kermit and Rowlf the Dog—appeared in skits on several late-night talk shows and on television commercials, including \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\" Rowlf became the first Muppet character with a regular spot on network television when he began appearing alongside Jimmy Dean on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\". In 1966, Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett began developing an educational television program targeted towards children and approached Henson to design several Muppet characters for the program. Produced by the Children's Television Workshop, the program debuted as \"Sesame Street\" in 1969. \n\nHenson and his creative team performed and created several characters for \"Sesame Street\" during the years that followed; Henson waived his performance fee in exchange for retaining ownership rights to the Muppet characters created for the program. \"Sesame Street\" received critical acclaim, and the Muppets' involvement in the series was touted to be a vital component of its increasing popularity, providing an \"effective and pleasurable viewing\" method of presentation for the series' educational curriculum.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Muppets continued their presence in television, primarily appearing in \"The Land of Gorch\" segments during the first season of \"Saturday Night Live\". As his involvement with \"Sesame Street\" continued, Henson mused about the possibility of creating a network television series featuring the Muppets; as opposed to \"Sesame Street\", however, this proposed series would be aimed at a more adult audience and focus largely on sketch comedy. Two pilot specials, \"The Muppets Valentine Show\" and \"\", aired on ABC in 1974 and 1975, respectively. \n\nAfter ABC passed on the pilots and no other major American network expressed interest in backing the project, British producer Lew Grade approached Henson and agreed to co-produce the series for Associated Television. Debuting in 1976, \"The Muppet Show\" introduced characters such as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, and Animal, in addition to showcasing regulars Kermit and Rowlf. Through its syndication, \"The Muppet Show\" became increasingly popular due to its sketch-variety format, unique brand of humor, and prolific roster of guest stars. The series went on to receive twenty-one Primetime Emmy Award nominations during its run and won four, including Outstanding Variety Series in 1978. The success of \"The Muppet Show\" allowed Henson Associates to diversify into theatrical films centered on the Muppets; the first of these, \"The Muppet Movie\", was released in 1979.\n\nFollowing \"The Muppet Movie\" were \"The Great Muppet Caper\" and \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\", released in 1981 and 1984, respectively. Collectively, the three films received four Academy Award nominations. In 1983, Henson debuted another television series, \"Fraggle Rock\", which ran on HBO in the United States until 1987.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Henson entered discussions with Michael Eisner and The Walt Disney Company, in which the latter would acquire Jim Henson Productions and, in turn, the Muppets. Disney expressed interest in purchasing the company for $150 million. In addition to the company and Muppet characters, Eisner expressed a desire to include the \"Sesame Street\" characters as part of the acquisition. Henson declined the proposal, consistently referring to such a motive as a \"non-starter\" for the deal. As discussions between the two companies continued, Henson and Walt Disney Imagineering preemptively began developing Muppet-themed attractions for the Disney-MGM Studios at Walt Disney World. \n\nHowever, the proposed merger was canceled after Henson's death in 1990. Nevertheless, Disney entered into a licensing agreement with Jim Henson Productions to use the characters in the theme parks. The following year, Muppet*Vision 3D debuted at Disney-MGM Studios, the only attraction to be successfully developed from the original Imagineering plans. Retaining interest in the franchise, Disney co-produced the fourth and fifth Muppet films, \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" and \"Muppet Treasure Island\", with Henson in 1992 and 1996, respectively. Following those films, the characters starred in \"Muppets Tonight\", which ran on ABC and later on Disney Channel from 1996 to 1998; and a sixth film, \"Muppets from Space\", released by Columbia Pictures in 1999.\n\nIn 2000, Henson was sold to EM.TV & Merchandising AG for $680 million. However, EM.TV was plagued with financial problems and the Henson family re-acquired the company in 2003, with the exception of the rights to the \"Sesame Street\" characters, which had been sold by EM.TV to Sesame Workshop.\n\nFourteen years after initial negotiations began, Disney acquired the Muppets intellectual property from the Jim Henson Company for $75 million on February 17, 2004. The acquisition consisted of the Muppets and \"Bear in the Big Blue House\" properties, as well as the Muppets film and television library. Exceptions included the \"Sesame Street\" characters, which were previously sold to Sesame Workshop; the \"Fraggle Rock\" characters, which were retained by Henson; and the distribution rights to \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\", \"Muppets from Space\", and \"Kermit's Swamp Years,\" which were retained by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Following the acquisition, Disney formed The Muppets Holding Company (later known as The Muppets Studio), a wholly owned subsidiary responsible for managing the characters and franchise. As a result, the term \"Muppet\" became a legal trademark of Disney; under license from Disney, Sesame Workshop continues to use the term for their characters, as well archival footage of Kermit the Frog.\n\nThe Jim Henson Company retains the rights to several productions featuring the Disney-owned Muppet characters, including \"Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas\"; \"The Christmas Toy\"; \"\"; \"Henson's Place\"; \"Billy Bunny's Animal Songs\"; the original \"Dog City\" special; and \"Donna's Day\". While some of these have since been released uncut, most current releases of \"Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas\" and \"The Christmas Toy\" omit the appearances by Kermit the Frog.\n\nDisney began gradually reintroducing the franchise to the mainstream in 2008. As a method of regaining a wider audience, Disney began to produce and release a series of comedy shorts on YouTube. After the Muppets' cover version of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was posted on the Muppet Studio's YouTube channel, it ultimately amassed 50 million views and won two Webby Awards. Videos are posted on the site regularly. In 2010, the Muppets starred in \"The Muppets Kitchen with Cat Cora\", which co-starred Cat Cora and showcased cooking demonstrations. A television special, \"\", premiered on NBC on December 17, 2008; and was released on DVD on September 29, 2009. \n\nIn 2010, Disney used the Muppets to promote their volunteerism program at the company's theme parks. A Halloween special featuring the Muppets was developed during that time and expected to air on ABC that October, but was canceled.\n\nIn 2011, the Muppets were featured in an eponymous seventh film, intended to serve as a \"creative reboot\" for the characters. Disney had been furthering development on a Muppets film since 2008 when it considered adapting an unused screenplay by Jerry Juhl. Directed by James Bobin; written by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller; and starring Segel, Amy Adams, Chris Cooper, and Rashida Jones, the film was met with widespread critical acclaim, commercial success, and an Academy Award win for Best Original Song. During the film's publicity campaign, the Muppets appeared in promotional advertisements and in effusive marketing efforts by Disney and were also featured in a promotional video for Google+. In March 2012, the Muppets received a collective star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. That year, the Muppets hosted a \"Just for Laughs\" comedy gala in Montreal.\n\nAfter the successful performance of \"The Muppets\", Disney announced an eighth film in March 2012, with Bobin and Stoller returning to direct and write, respectively. \"Muppets Most Wanted\" was released in 2014, and starred Ricky Gervais; Tina Fey; and Ty Burrell.\n\nDisney Theatrical Productions revealed in 2013 that a live show based on the Muppets was in active development and that a 15-minute show had been conducted by Thomas Schumacher to see how the technical components would work. \"Muppet Moments\", an interstitial television series, premiered on Disney Junior in April 2015. The short-form series features conversations between the Muppets and young children.\n\nAfter the release of \"Muppets Most Wanted\", Disney was interested in expanding the Muppets' presence across various media platforms, particularly in television. Discussions for a new primetime series began internally within the Muppets Studio. By April 2015, Bill Prady was commissioned to write a script for a pilot with the working title, \"Muppets 2015\". In May 2015, ABC announced that it had greenlit a new primetime television series titled \"The Muppets\", co-developed by Prady and Bob Kushell and directed by Randall Einhorn. The series premiered on September 22, 2015 in the United States, and ended on March 1, 2016. In 2017, the Muppets performed a series of live shows from September 8-10 at the Hollywood Bowl, hosted by Bobby Moynihan. A web television series featuring the Muppets is in development as of February 2018, tentatively scheduled to debut alongside the Disney+ streaming service in 2019. In July 2018, the cast performed a series of live shows at London's O2 Arena, their first outside of the United States.\n\nNotable Muppet characters of \"The Muppet Show\" and subsequent media include Kermit the Frog; Miss Piggy; Fozzie Bear; Gonzo; Rowlf the Dog; Scooter; Rizzo the Rat; Pepe the King Prawn; Dr. Bunsen Honeydew; Beaker; Statler and Waldorf; the Swedish Chef; Sam Eagle; Walter; and the Electric Mayhem, consisting of Dr. Teeth on keyboard, Animal on drums, Floyd Pepper on bass, Janice on lead guitar, Zoot on saxophone, and occasionally Lips on trumpet.\n\nAs well as \"The Muppet Show\", Muppet characters feature in such television series as \"The Jimmy Dean Show\", \"Sesame Street\", \"Fraggle Rock\", \"The Jim Henson Hour\", \"Muppets Tonight\", \"Bear in the Big Blue House\", \"\", and \"The Muppets\". An adult-oriented Muppet segment, \"The Land of Gorch\", was a regular feature in the first season of \"Saturday Night Live\". Guest stars on \"Saturday Night Live\" occasionally include both the Muppets and \"Sesame Street\" characters, as well as Muppet likenesses of real people; these likenesses appear recurrently in early episodes of \"The Muppet Show\" and on \"Sesame Street\", and appear occasionally on other series such as \"30 Rock\".\n\nFollowing Disney's acquisition of the Muppets, puppets created by The Jim Henson Company are no longer referred to as Muppets. Puppets created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, such as those in \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Dark Crystal\", have never been considered Muppets, as they are generally more complex in design and performance than regular Muppets. The \"Star Wars\" character Yoda was originally performed by Frank Oz, one of Henson's regular performers, and is often described as a Muppet in media and reference works; he is not, however, and Henson was not involved in the character's conception.\n\nAt the start of the Muppets' formation, Jim and Jane Henson were the group's only performers. In 1961, Jane retired to focus on raising their children. Seeking additional performers, Jim came into contact with Frank Oz that year. Although interested, Oz initially declined due to his youth and commitment to high school, and instead suggested Jerry Juhl, who worked alongside Oz at the Vagabond Puppet Theater in Oakland, California. Upon graduating, Oz subsequently joined in August 1963. By the time \"The Muppet Show\" began, the primary cast of performers grew to consist of Henson; Oz; Dave Goelz; Jerry Nelson; Richard Hunt; and later, Steve Whitmire, while Juhl became head writer for the series. From \"The Muppet Show\" onward, Kevin Clash; Kathryn Mullen; Louise Gold; Karen Prell; Caroll Spinney; and Brian Henson performed several minor characters and often assisted the main performers with puppeteering. Many of these puppeteers performed characters across \"The Muppet Show,\" \"Sesame Street\", \"Fraggle Rock\", and other Henson-related projects.\n\nHenson, Hunt, and Nelson continued performing until their deaths in 1990, 1992, and 2012, respectively. Whitmire; Goelz; and Bill Barretta, who joined the main cast of performers in the 1990s, assumed Henson's characters, with Whitmire also assuming the role of Beaker. The remainder of Hunt's characters were left without a stable performer until David Rudman began performing those characters in the late 2000s. Oz continued performing until his retirement from puppeteering in 2000; Eric Jacobson assumed his characters beginning in 2002. At Nelson's behest, Matt Vogel gradually began performing his characters in 2008. \n\nWhitmire was dismissed from the cast in 2016, with Vogel cast as Kermit the Frog in 2017, and the majority of Whitmire's characters assumed by the remainder of the cast. The Muppets are currently performed by a cast of six principal puppeteers: Jacobson, Goelz, Barretta, Rudman, Vogel and Peter Linz.\n\nThe majority of the Muppets are designed as hand puppets, with several characters utilizing rods. Common design elements of the Muppets include wide mouths and large protruding eyes. The puppets are often molded or carved out of various types of foam, and then covered with any felt-like material. Muppets may represent humans; anthropomorphic characters; realistic animals; robots; extraterrestrial creatures; mythical beings; or other newly-conceived creatures, monsters, or abstract characters.\n\nThe Muppets are distinguished from ventriloquist dummies, which are often animated only in the head and face, in that their arms or other features are also animated. Muppets are also generally made of softer materials. They are presented as being independent of the puppeteer, who is usually not visible—hidden behind a set or outside of the camera frame. Using the camera frame as the \"stage\" was an innovation of the Muppets. Previously on television, there would usually be a stage hiding the performers, as if in a live presentation. Sometimes, they are seen full-bodied; this is achieved by using invisible strings to manipulate the characters, with vocals added at a later point.\n\nSince 2006, Disney has contracted Puppet Heap to produce and maintain newer models of the Muppets. The puppeteer, referred to as the \"Muppet performer\", holds the character above their head or in front of their body, with one hand operating the head and mouth and the other manipulating the hands and arms, either with two separate control rods or - in the case of \"live-hand\" Muppets - wearing the hands similarly to gloves. One consequence of this design is that most Muppets are left-handed, with the performer using their right hand to operate the head while operating the arm rod with their left hand. \n\nIn the case of more complex Muppets, several puppeteers may control a single character; the performer who controls the mouth usually provides the voice for the character. As technology has evolved, the Jim Henson team and other puppeteers have developed several means to operate the Muppets for film and television; these include the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, remote manipulators, and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of different technologies has allowed for scenes in which the Muppets appear to perform such complex movements as riding bicycles, rowing boats, and dancing wholly independently of the performer.\n\nAccording to writer Michael Davis, the characters tend to develop \"organically\", alluding to the performers taking time, often up to a year, slowly developing their characters and voices. The characters are also \"test-driven, passed around from one Henson troupe member to another in the hope of finding the perfect human-Muppet match\". When interacting with them, children tended to act as though the Muppets were living creatures, even when they could see the puppeteers.\n\nOn September 17, 2002, Rhino Records released \"\", a compilation album of music from \"The Muppet Show\" and subsequent film outings. The Muppets also released \"\", with John Denver in 1979.\n\nUnder Disney ownership, albums featuring the Muppets have been released by Walt Disney Records, including \"Best of the Muppets: The Muppets' Wizard of Oz\" (2005), \"\" (2006), \"\" (2011), \"The Muppets: Original Soundtrack\" (2011), and \"Muppets Most Wanted: Original Soundtrack\" (2014). Legal music publishing rights to Muppet-related songs such as \"Rainbow Connection\", are controlled by Fuzzy Muppet Songs and Mad Muppet Melodies, imprints of Disney Music Publishing.\n\nThe Muppets appear at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, having first made appearances at Walt Disney World in 1990. Their first featured attraction, \"Here Comes the Muppets\", was a live stage show that opened shortly after Jim Henson's death and ran at Disney's Hollywood Studios (known then as Disney-MGM Studios) for a year. Muppet*Vision 3D, a 4D film attraction that uses audio-animatronic Muppets and 4D effects, then opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios on May 16, 1991. The attraction is notable for being the final Muppets project to be produced by Jim Henson. Muppet*Vision 3D had a subsequent opening at Disney California Adventure, on February 8, 2001, and operated there until its closure in 2014.\n\nIn addition to their main presence at Disney's Hollywood Studios, the Muppets also appear in \"Great Moments in American History\", a live show at the Magic Kingdom and the Muppet Mobile Lab at Epcot. The latter attraction is a free-roving vehicle with audio-animatronics of Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. As part of Disney's Living Character Initiative, it premiered in 2007 at Epcot and was later previewed at Disney California Adventure and Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nIn 2010, the Muppets were the face of the \"Give a Day, Get a Disney Day\" charity campaign. Guests could register for a select service activity on the Disney website, and in return for completing the service work, participants could print a voucher for a free one-day admission ticket to Disneyland or Walt Disney World Resort. The Muppets appeared in television and print ads for the campaign and were featured prominently on the campaign's website.\n\nDisney has released numerous collector pins featuring the Muppets since 2004. These include Limited Edition pins, Hidden Mickey pin collections, mystery pin sets, 2008 pin sets promoting \"The Muppets\", cast lanyard pins, and assorted individual rack pins. Over 100 pins displaying the characters have been released overall.\n\nSince the late 1970s, numerous Muppet-related comic books have been released over the years. The first comic strips based on the Muppets appeared on September 21, 1981, in over 500 daily newspapers, just months after \"The Muppet Show\" ended its five-year run. \"The Muppets Comic Strip\" was printed daily from 1981 to 1986. By the end of its initial run, the comic strip was seen in over 660 newspapers worldwide. Special strips were also created in color, exclusively for issues of \"Muppet Magazine\".\n\nThe only film in the franchise to see a comic book adaptation was \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\". The comic book series was adapted by Marvel Comics in 1984, as the 68-page story in \"Marvel Super Special\" No. 32, August. The adaptation was later re-printed into three limited series issues, released under Marvel's Star Comics imprint (November 1984 – January 1985).\n\nIn the wake of the success of the \"Muppet Babies\" television show, Star Comics began releasing the \"Muppet Babies\" comic book title on a bi-monthly basis. These were original stories, not adaptations of the show's episodes. In the final \"Disney Adventures\" issue, with a cover date of November 2007, a one-page story single strip focusing on Fozzie Bear, Smedley, Statler, and Waldorf (with a cameo by Scooter) was released. Roger Langridge wrote and drew the comics intending it to be more long running.\n\nIn 2009, Boom! Studios began publishing \"The Muppet Show\", a mini-series based on the eponymous television show and written and drawn by Roger Langridge. An ongoing series titled \"The Muppet Show: The Comic Book\" followed and ran for eleven issues. Additionally, Boom! Studios also published Muppet fairy-tale comic adaptations similar to \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" and \"Muppet Treasure Island\". In 2012, Marvel Comics took over the publishing duties for the series.\n\nA comic strip by Guy Gilchrist and Brad Gilchrist circulated in newspapers during the 1980s. Many of the strips were compiled in various book collections.\n\n\"Muppet Magazine\" was published from 1983 to 1989. The magazine took on the format of being by the Muppets more than about them and had such features as celebrity interviews and comic stories.\n\nThe popularity of the Muppets has been so pervasive that the characters have been viewed by the media as celebrities in their own right. The Muppets have received their own collective star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, with Kermit having his own individual star as well. The characters have also presented at the Academy Awards and Emmy Awards; made cameo appearances in such feature films as \"Rocky III\", \"An American Werewolf in London\" and \"Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium\"; and have been interviewed on the news magazine \"60 Minutes\". \n\nKermit was interviewed early on in Jon Stewart's run on \"The Daily Show\", guest hosted \"The Tonight Show\", \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", \"\", \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" and an April Fools' Day edition of \"Larry King Live\"; and has served as Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade. The characters also appeared in-character on such sitcoms and dramas as \"The Cosby Show\", \"The West Wing,\" and \"The Torkelsons\". The music video for the Weezer song \"Keep Fishin'\" is premised on the band performing on \"The Muppet Show\" and features appearances by several characters. \n\nOn September 28, 2005, the United States Postal Service released a \"Jim Henson and the Muppets\" postage stamp series. The Muppets also appeared on \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\" for the 2008 countdown on December 31, 2007. Kermit, Rizzo, and others welcomed in the new year with a series of messages to welcome viewers back from the advertising breaks. After one such segment, with Kermit in Times Square, co-host Ryan Seacrest thanked his pal \"Kerms\" for the help bringing in '08. Miss Piggy has appeared as a guest on \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\" and Kermit appeared on \"Hollywood Squares\" and as one of the celebrity commentators on VH1's \"I Love\" documentary series. Kermit and the Muppets (and also Bear from \"Bear in the Big Blue House\") have also made many appearances on \"The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon\".\n\nOn July 25, 2007, the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta announced the opening of a new Jim Henson Wing, which would house anywhere from 500 to 700 retired Muppets. The new wing, first set to open in 2012 with films, sketches, and other materials from the Jim Henson Company archives, eventually opened as a gallery within the \"Worlds of Puppetry\" exhibition at the Center in November 2015.\n\nMuppet-like and Muppet-inspired puppets star in the 2004 Tony Award-winning Broadway musical \"Avenue Q\". Peter Jackson's film, \"Meet the Feebles\" is another parody of the Muppets. A vomit-spewing Kermit the Frog was a recurring character on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", and the Muppets were frequently preempted at the beginning of episodes for the Canadian series \"You Can't Do That on Television.\" Seth Green's short-lived show \"Greg the Bunny\" was about sentient hand-puppets working in a Muppet-like children's show. Many other films and television shows such as \"The Simpsons\", \"Family Guy\", \"The West Wing\" and \"Robot Chicken\" have referenced The Muppets.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36398735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36398735", "title": "The Return of the World's Greatest Detective", "text": "The Return of the World's Greatest Detective\n\nThe Return Of The World's Greatest Detective is a 1976 American made-for-television mystery comedy film starring Larry Hagman as an inept motorcycle cop named Sherman Holmes, who, after sustaining a head injury, became convinced that he was actually Sherlock Holmes and as a result of his injury acquired formidable powers of observation and deduction. Dean Hargrove and Roland Kibbee wrote the film's story directly for television, intending it to be a pilot for a series that would have been titled \"Alias Sherlock Holmes.\" The film originally aired on NBC on June 16, 1976.\n\nThe genres into which \"The Return Of The World's Greatest Detective\" fits are comedy-drama and mystery-suspense.\n\nLos Angeles Police Department officer Sherman Holmes (Hagman) is an inept motorcycle cop who can't keep his police motorcycle from falling over on its side. He is lying on the ground reading a copy of \"The Complete Sherlock Holmes\" when his motorcycle again falls over on its side — this time on his head, causing a cranial injury that leaves him comatose.\n\nWhen he regains consciousness, Sherman Holmes has come to believe that he is actually Sherlock Holmes, the civilian consulting detective of literary renown. He also has acquired formidable powers of observation and deduction that he did not possess as a motorcycle officer. Holmes adopts the habits and mode of dress (houndtooth gray deerstalker's cap, houndtooth-gray Inverness cape, and \"full-bent\" meerschaum smoking pipe) of the literary detective, along with a stylized British accent.\n\nThe social worker and psychiatrist assigned to work with Holmes is Dr. Joan Watson (Jenny O'Hara), the psychiatrist who had given Holmes the copy of the Sherlock Holmes \"canon\" in the first place. Her superior (Booth Colman) warns that her job is at risk because of the situation. LAPD Detective Lt. Nicholas \"Nick\" Tinker (Nicholas Colasanto) is somewhat skeptical of what has happened to Holmes, but Watson points out that this Holmes wants anonymity as much as the literary Holmes did. She likewise arranges for him to move into Apartment 221B in an apartment complex located on Baker Street.\n\nThese strange occurrences take place at the same time of a case that has been baffling the LAPD: scandals that appear to involve a judge, the Honorable Clement Harley (Charles Macauley). Among these are the murder of an embezzler and a series of smoke-bombings. Holmes manages to solve both these cases—and expose an instance of judicial corruption in the process.\n\nDean Hargrove, who directed the film and jointly wrote and produced it with Roland Kibbee, loosely re-made the 1971 feature film \"They Might Be Giants\" in producing it. He and Kibbee both hoped it would become the pilot of a series titled \"Alias Sherlock Holmes,\" but NBC-TV declined to pick up that option.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54413498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54413498", "title": "Theatre of Cameroon", "text": "Theatre of Cameroon\n\nTheatre of Cameroon consists in the theatrical plays produced across Cameroon. Its history dates back to the pre-colonial time, but it has gained wide popularity since the 1970s, with practitioners such as Daniel Ndo, Dieudonné Afana and David Kemzeu (alias Deiv K. Moktoï). It is made of different trends, some of them are more inflected by the European theatrical tradition, some others are more attuned to the indigenous performative styles. The comic genre is presently dominating so that laughter has become synonymous with modern Cameroon theatre productions, according to Bole Butake. Theatre of Cameroon is sometimes subdivided in traditional theatre, colonial theatre, and post-independence theatre.\n\nCameroonian theatre production starts well before the annexation of Cameroon by the Germans at the Berlin Conference. Traditional ceremonies and rituals, which are made of a combination of dance, music, spoken word and mime, can be seen as forms of theatrical performance. Ambassa Betoko points at the Mvet among the Betis, the Ngondo among the Sawas, and the So among the Ewondos, while Tala interprets the religious ceremony Menda-Nkwe of the North-West Cameroon as a ritual drama. The traditional theatre’s main features are multi-mediality, improvisation of the dialogues, and the spontaneous participation of members of the audience in the performance. During the pre-colonial time also missionaries stage theatrical plays, in order to spread their religious message and Christianize the native people. These are dramatizations of Bible passages in the local languages, such as «The parable of the ten virgins», «The birth and death of Christ» and «The treachery of Judas».\n\nDuring the colonial era, theatre becomes a didactic tool used by teachers in schools. They organize the staging of European playwrights such as Molière, Shakespeare and La Fontaine, in both colonial and local languages, and encourage the writing of new works. According to the colonialist mentality of the time, the goal is to educate and uplift the local viewers from their so-called “primitive” ways of lives, through plays that celebrate the virtues of Western culture.\n\nAfter independence, there is an upsurge in dramatic production, characterized by artistic-oriented scripts, the use of standard French/English and well-educated publics. The first play of francophone Cameroon is \"Trois prétendants: un mari\" by Guillaume Oyono-Mbia, while \"I am Vindicated\" by Sankie Maimo is the first play of anglophone Cameroon. Many factors contribute to this favorable situation. A first boost comes from the mass-media and particularly the establishment of radio dramas by such stations as BBC and RFI. The \"Concours théâtrale interafricain\" on RFI plays a major role in this regard. The French Cultural Centers are also helpful in so far as they sponsor the staging of plays in French, by offering their halls and giving financial and material assistance to the troupes. The postcolonial state gives some support in the first decades after independence. In 1976, the Ministry of Information and Culture establishes the troupe \"Théâtre National\" in the effort to promote African and especially Cameroonian theatre among the wide public. In addition, schools and universities organize theatre clubs to teach theatre culture to the youths. The professionalism of the Yaounde University theatre groups is here remarkable.\n\nMost of the plays center on the conflicts between modernity and tradition, while openly political plays are rare, due to the repressive regimes of Ahmadou Ahidjo and his successor Paul Biya. Within this context, it is an exception the committed work of Bole Butake, which, for example, denounces the so-called Anglophone problem, namely the cultural, economic and political marginalization of Anglophone Cameroon (North-West and South-West regions) by the francophone elites in power. His major creative works are « Lake God », « And palm wine will flow », « The survivors », « Shoes and four men in arms », « Dance of the vampires » and « The Rape of Michelle ». Bole Butake is sometimes considered the boldest and most committed author of Cameroon. Another important political author is Babila Mutia, whose « Before this time yesterday » touches upon the burning question of the UPC rebellion.\n\nDue to the lack of theatre halls and the scarcity of resources, theatrical plays are rarely staged and tend to circulate as texts, often published by the Yaounde Editions C.L.E. They are read by the educated people, but rarely known by the wider public.\n\nSince the 1970s a new kind of theatre has come up, following the huge success of the Radio Cameroon program \"Radio Trottoir\", which launched the comic character of Jean Miché Kankan, an old and greedy bamileke man, performed by Dieudonné Afana. This new kind of farcical theatre is known as “Cameroonian popular theatre” to distance it from more serious forms of theatre. Followed by ordinary people, such as taxi drivers, beer-retailers, and shop-keepers, it circulates widely. Beyond the radio, it is staged in cultural centers, official ceremonies, bars, conference halls, street corners, and recorded on sound cassettes, CDs and videos, sold in markets and by itinerant paddlers. Its main features are comedy, improvisation and linguistic creativity. Its comic quality comes from the exaggerated and grotesque representation of the everyday, through a series of stock characters such as the poor villager and the old man who does not understand the modern world around him. This type of theatre is motivated by the material interest of the practitioners who aim at winning over the widest public as possible in order to earn a living, but it also conveys some social critic, behind its apparent escapism. Unlike other Cameroonian theatrical productions, it is generally oral, sometimes combining dramatic action with musical performances, singing and dancing. The actors improvise the dialogues on the scene and directly address the public that can participate in the creation of the play. They use \"Camfranglais\" – i.e. the local vernacular language made of a mix of French, English, Pidgin English, local languages and other Western languages - instead of standard French/English. Taking up the slang of the disadvantaged districts of Douala and Yaounde, they embrace the fluidity of this young and oral language to make up hilarious neologisms. As a result, their plays are set in a very specific Cameroonian setting. However, some Cameroonians condemn this linguistic creativity as a bastardization of Western languages, while others see it as a simple way to win over a non-educated public, without transmitting any social message.\n\nThe main promoters of the Cameroonian popular theatre are Daniel Ndo (with the character of Oncle Otsama, the stereotype of the old ewondo villager, who misunderstands the meaning of what is happening in the world around him), Dieudonné Afana (with the character of Jean Miché Kankan, the parody of the stingy and bad-tempered bamileke man), and David Kemzeu (alias Deiv K. Moktoï, with the character of Newrich Proudlove, a professor of “social affarism” who teaches how to get rich fraudulently, without being caught. They are well-known characters not only in Cameroon, but also in the rest of Africa and in the diaspora.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3142697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3142697", "title": "Vintage clothing", "text": "Vintage clothing\n\nVintage clothing is a generic term for garments originating from a previous era. The phrase is also used in connection with a retail outlet, e.g. in \"vintage clothing store.\" Today vintage dressing encompasses choosing accessories, mixing vintage garments with new, as well as creating an ensemble of various styles and periods. Vintage clothes typically sell at low prices for high end named brands. It has been part of the world since World War I as an idea of reusing clothing because of the textile shortage.\n\nVintage clothing can be found in cities at local boutiques or local charities, or also on the internet (e.g. eBay and Etsy). Goodwill and Salvation Army are the top two charites to donate or shop for vintage clothing. Vintage clothing is used as a muse for new designs and is known to be retro clothing. \n\nGenerally speaking, clothing which was produced before the 1920s is referred to as antique clothing and clothing from the 1920s to 20 years before the present day is considered vintage. Retro, short for retrospective, or \"vintage style,\" usually refers to clothing that imitates the style of a previous era. Reproduction, or repro, clothing is a newly made copy of an older garment. Clothing produced more recently is usually called \"modern\" or \"contemporary\" fashion. Opinions vary for these definitions.\n\nVintage clothing is a form of ease in a fast moving world. Re-wearing clothes from a personal wardrobe and wearing newly acquired vintage and retro clothing, can be understood as a desire to recreate familiarity, or felicity, in a world that is rapidly changing and increasingly impersonal.\n\nMost vintage clothing has been previously worn, but a small percentage of pieces have not. These are often old warehouse stock, and more valuable than those that have been worn, especially if they have their original tags. Referred to as deadstock or new old stock (NOS), they nevertheless sometimes have flaws. Vintage clothing may be either commercially produced or handmade by individuals.\n\nIn the United States, due to changes in clothing sizes, vintage sizes are often smaller than the corresponding contemporary size. For example, a garment from the 1970s labeled as Medium (M) might be similar in size to a 2010s Extra Small (XS). As obesity was relatively uncommon prior to the 1980s, larger sizes are typically rare. Vintage sewing patterns offer an option for those who want a historically accurate garment but cannot find one in their size.\n\nPopular places to buy vintage clothing include, charity-run second hand clothing shops, consignment shops, garage sales, car boot sales, flea markets, antique markets, estate sales, auctions, vintage clothing shops and vintage fashion, textile or collectables fairs. One of the first regular fairs that was set up specifically to cater for the current demand for vintage clothing is Frock Me!. This event takes place regularly throughout the year in Chelsea, London as well as in Brighton. Vintage clothing is sometimes also obtained from older friends and relatives.\n\nTypically in the United States, vintage clothing shops can be found clustered in college towns and artsy neighborhoods of cities. Sizing is a major factor – in most locations in the United States, the majority of the population would be unable to find vintage clothing that fits. In contrast to thrift stores that sell both vintage and contemporary used clothing, vintage clothing shops are usually for-profit enterprises, with the market mixed between small chains and independent stores. These stores typically range from 200 to 5,000 square feet in size, and will usually have a fitting room. In addition to selling clothing and accessories, many vintage clothing stores also buy clothing from the public in exchange for cash or store credit.\n\nThe advent of the internet has been a boon to the vintage clothing industry. It has increased the availability of specific and hard-to-get items and opened up prospective markets for sellers around the world. Popular places to acquire garments include online auctions (e.g. eBay), multi-vendor sites (e.g. Etsy), online vintage clothing shops and specialist forums. Many vintage clothing shops with physical locations now also sell their goods online.\n\nVintage clothing offers past and present clothing at low prices.  The reduced name brand clothes accomplish uniqueness and originality. Vintage shopping can be viewed as a continuation of discount culture, while simultaneously achieving an individual identity and exclusivity that the brand names have lost.\n\nSince the beginning of World War I the idea of vintage clothing or reusing clothing was a way of living. During World War I, most clothing was repaired, mended, or tailored for other family members or recycled within the home as rags or quilts. The government conservation campaign used slogans such as “Make economy fashionable lest it become obligatory” resulted in an approximate 10% reduction in the production of trash.\n\nIn the late 20th century there was as increased demand for high end name brands. During the 1980s, vintage clothing in North America increased because of the demand for reduce high-end name brands. Now fashion is non selective as it used to be, as vintage clothing has moved to subculture to mass culture it is often not limited.\n\nFashion is fast and at our finger tips. The very definition of fashion fuels the momentum for change, which creates demand for ongoing replacement of products with something that is new and fresh.\n\nThis increase in interest is due in part to increased visibility, as vintage clothing was increasingly worn by top models and celebrities, e.g. Julia Roberts, Renée Zellweger, Chloë Sevigny, Tatiana Sorokko, Kate Moss, and Dita Von Teese. Popularity of period pieces set in the mid 20th century in television and film have also contributed to vintage's popularity. There is even an international magazine called * Vintage Life – specifically a Women's Fashion and Lifestyle Magazine.\n\nThere has also been an increasing interest in environmental sustainability in terms of reusing, recycling and repairing rather than throwing things away. Sometimes vintage items are upcycled via changing the hemline or other features for a more contemporary look. Vintage items in poor condition are also salvaged for reuse as part of new garments.\n\nThe textile recycling industry is the environmental part of the fashion industry. Throughout the world, used apparel products are salvaged as reclaimed textiles and put to new uses. The textile recycling industry is able to process over ninety percent of the waste without the production of any new hazardous waste or harmful by product.\n\nA resurgence of historically based sub-cultural groups like rockabilly and swing dancing has also played a part in the increased interest in vintage clothes. In Finland the vintage scene has even spawned an officially recognized association or non-profit organization called Fintage out of common interest in the preservation of material culture and the environment.\n\nFashion design, throughout history has turned to previous eras for inspiration. Vintage clothing retains and increases in value due to the fact that it is genuinely from a past era. In addition, authentic garments are made one at a time, with enough attention to detail to create an item that has long lasting value. Garments closely resembling original vintage (retro or antique) clothing are mass-produced, for the most part, in China. An example of this is the simple slip dresses that emerged in the early 1990s, a style that resembles a 1930s design, but upon examination will show that it only superficially resembles the real thing. These styles are generally referred to as \"vintage style\", \"vintage inspired\" or \"vintage reproductions\". They serve as a convenient alternative to those who admire an old style but prefer a modern interpretation. Sellers claim consumer advantage in that, unlike the original garments, they are usually available in a range of sizes and perhaps, colours and/or fabrics, and can be sold much cheaper.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11717690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11717690", "title": "Wildstorm Universe", "text": "Wildstorm Universe\n\nThe Wildstorm Universe is a fictional shared universe where the comic books published by Wildstorm take place. It represents an alternate history of the real world where ideas such as interstellar travel and superhuman abilities are commonplace. It is also the name of one of three brands launched by Wildstorm to help differentiate their titles set in the same universe from other, separate titles. Originally launched as part of the Image Universe, it broke off as its own separate universe during the \"Shattered Image\" storyline.\n\nThe Wildstorm Universe began as part of the Image Comics Universe. During \"Shattered Image\", Wildstorm broke off from Image and constituted a separate universe. The Wildstorm's universe represents an alternate history of the real world, with further similarities to other comic book universes (especially the DC Universe). Interstellar travel and alien races, including the Kherubim and Drahn, are taken for granted, and centuries or more of alien contact gave rise to a distinctive mythology in Wildstorm worlds. Fictional technologies, or technologies only theoretically possible in the real world, are present in the Wildstorm Universe. Superhuman agents are commonplace and involved in world politics: Stormwatch dealt extensively with the United Nations, and The Authority took over governance of the United States.\n\nThe D'rahn are an alien race. They are humanoid in appearance, but are generally larger than humans with grey skin and red eyes without visible iris or pupil. Three bony ridges are on the top of their head. Their ears are rudimentary, little more than large openings in the sides of their heads. There are similar openings in their cheeks, but the purpose of these openings is unclear. Their hands have large claws and a female D'rahn also showed extendable bone claws. While there are recursive traits among members of the D'rahn such as superior Strength, Speed, Flight, Invulnerability, Etc. some possess traits unique to their social standing or generally from individual to individual for starters; Alphas of the hive like breed withhold greater power levels than that of even Kherubim Lords. Other have energy generative and manipulation capability one of the extraterrestrial's most distinguishing feature; prominent only within the female of the species, being the ability of accelerated genetic progression in the form of controlled evolution dubbed 'The Enlightenment'. A process where a fecund entity of their tribe can rework another sentient's very DNA to enhance and progress their developmental evolution by injecting them with her stinger vastly augmenting preexisting attributes and bestowing newer, greater power unto the host involved or irrepressibly destabilize it causing catastrophic biological atrophy and inevitable destruction by effectively rending their very matriculation asunder.\n\nSuperpowered characters in Wildstorm, other than those bioengineered for superhuman powers, represent four categories of metahuman:\n\n\nIn the Wildstorm Universe, one of the sources of superhuman powers is the Gen-factor. The Gen-factor was discovered by Dr. Simon Tsung, who found it in the body of young Ethan McCain, a reincarnation of the extradimensional hero, Sigma. Tsung worked for Project: Genesis, a project run by International Operations for national defense purposes, but Tsung left when he found out that I.O.-leader Miles Craven had his own plans for the use of the Gen-factor. Tsung's work was continued by his protégé Gabriel Newman and after many failures, the first truly successful application of the Gen-factor was the exposure of Team 7 to the substance.\n\nMiles Craven later contacted Kaizen Gamorra and had him create a synthesized version of the Gen-factor. Ivana Baiul, an I.O.-operative and scientist was charged with the creation of activator and booster drugs that would activate and enhance the powers of people who had the Gen-factor, turning them Gen-Active. After Team 7, other experiments were done on humans of their generation; Team 7 and the other successful experiments were all labelled as Gen 12. Kaizen also started selling his synthesized Gen-factor to everyone who could afford it. This led to Gen-active humans worldwide, but many of them were highly unstable and none were as powerful as Team 7.\n\nProject: Genesis restarted 15–20 years later and the subjects this time were the children of Gen 12. Craven hoped that the younger subjects were easier to control and that being born with the Gen-factor made their powers more stable. Apart from children of Gen 12, other children exposed to the Gen-factor in various ways were recruited as well. This time the subjects were labelled as Gen¹³, though this name was taken by a small group of Gen¹³ Gen-Actives. Another group took the name DV8 (also known as the Deviants). Many other Gen-Active teenagers have been seen over the years, mostly the result of various I.O.-experiments; like Nate, Tommy, Sadie (Voodoo Doll) and Leslie (Trauma Queen), four Gen-Actives that befriended Gen¹³ and jokingly called themselves \"The Mongolian Barbecue Avengers\".\n\nAll Gen-Active humans have a telepathic link to each other. This link usually is very weak, even unnoticeable to most, but stronger between relatives (they sometimes can feel when a relative is in extreme pain). The link also allows sensitive Gen-Actives to notice the presence of other Gen-Actives. In case of Team 7, the link also made the sum of their powers greater than each member's individual powers.\n\nThe powers that individual Gen-Actives receive, seem to be completely random; most of Team 7 gained strong telepathic and telekinetic powers and some gained a healing factor. Their children though have displayed very different and unique abilities.\n\nIn addition to humans, at least one human/Kherubim hybrid (Backlash) has also been affected by the Gen-Factor. It has also affected animals, and was used in creating the Kindred.\n\n\nThough storylines in \"The Authority\" had portrayed Wildstorm as a multiverse, the 2006-7 DC Comics event \"52\" situated the Wildstorm Universe as a single parallel universe among 52 such realities in the DC Comics Multiverse.\n\n\"52\" made crossovers between DC and Wildstorm titles likely. The first of these occurred in \"Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer - Wildstorm\", a team called the Challengers visit the Wildstorm Universe on their tour of the multiverse in search of Ray Palmer, the only person capable of stopping a forthcoming Great Disaster. The Challengers conflicted with the Authority, who had killed a speedster left by Palmer as a marker that he had passed through. The fight ended when Majestic interceded and forced the Authority to let the Challengers go. Meanwhile Gen characters encountered another group of DC characters bent on stopping the Challengers.\n\nMajor titles set in the WildStorm Universe include:\n\n\n\"Team 7\" was one of the first comics that served as the backbone in the Wildstorm Universe. It showcased the early days of major characters from many of the ongoing WSU series. Grifter, Dane, Backlash, John Lynch, and Deathblow all starred in books at the time.\n\nThe first Team 7 series was four issues and showed how the characters were exposed to a chemical weapon that resulted in their gaining of a \"Gen-Factor\" which later was the source to many Wildstorm characters. The second miniseries was three issues, the first of which served as a prologue to the first Wildstorm Universe crossover. The final Team 7 miniseries was four issues and helped fill in many of the previously referenced plot points that helped to explain the characters' relationships in the present (why Grifter and Backlash hate each other, how John Lynch lost his eye, and Jackson Dane's apparent amnesia). Team One was, chronologically, a precursor team to Team 7, having character overlaps.\n\nMany Wildstorm Universe stories referred to the Kherubium/Daemonite War, a fictional historical event explored in most depth in the \"WildC.A.T.S\" series.\n\nA storyline that crossed over \"WildC.A.T.S\", \"Stormwatch\", and the movie franchise \"Aliens\" brought significant changes to the Wildstorm Universe, killing off many established characters and laying the ground for the Wildstorm Universe's new flagship series, \"The Authority\".\n\nIn 2005/2006, DCU character Captain Atom appeared in a nine-part limited series entitled \"Captain Atom: Armageddon\" under DC's WildStorm imprint. In this title, he wore the yellow/red outfit seen in the \"Kingdom Come\" series.\n\nIn the story, Captain Atom experiences a time-shift at the moment of his apparent 2005 death in \"Superman/Batman\", transporting him to the WildStorm Universe. He quickly gets into and appears to win a fight with an overzealous Mr. Majestic. Observing the frightened reactions of onlookers, and puzzling over his own altered appearance, he realizes that he has somehow become trapped on an alternate Earth, one where superheroes are feared by the general populace. Mistaken by the local superheroes as the force destined to destroy their universe, he was in fact an instrument used ultimately by Nikola Hanssen, new host for half the essence of the Void, to reclaim her whole power (partially lodged in his own body, and the cause of his altered appearance). During the story, Atom at first cooperates with both WildC.A.T.s and The Authority; as the story closes, these two teams become enemies and are all killed, as Void triggers the reboot of the WildStorm universe.\n\nThe 'reboot' set the ground for a November 2006 relaunch of many Wildstorm titles. At first, the new titles appeared to include major changes to Wildstorm continuity; as stories progressed efforts were made to explain these changes so as to preserve continuity from before the Worldstorm event.\n\nThe relaunched titles were:\n\nNew titles included:\n\nDuring this period in Wildstorm's publishing history, the DC Comics year-long series \"52\" reimagined the Wildstorm Universe as part of the DC Multiverse, designating it Earth-50.\n\nThe Worldstorm relaunch faltered as 2007 drew on. Both flagship titles, \"The Authority\" and \"Wildcats\", were slated to be written by Grant Morrison with \"Wildcats\" drawn by Jim Lee and \"The Authority\" drawn by Gene Ha, but the pair encountered serious delays. Only one issue of \"Wildcats\"' and two of \"The Authority\" ever shipped. Eventually, amid disapproving fan reaction, both series were cancelled.\n\nBefore the announcement that Morrison's series would not continue, Christos Gage filled in with \"The Authority: Prime\". The series shipped promptly, and Gage was hired to write a new cross-universe series \"\". \"Armageddon\" comprised six one-shots based on six of the relaunched titles, and led into successive bi-weekly limited series \"\" and \"Number of the Beast\". These culminated in the \"World's End\" storyline, beginning July 2008, which documented worldwide catastrophe and saw several Wildstorm titles relaunched with new creative teams and a new status quo for the universe.\n\n\"World's End\" titles:\n\nWildstorm editor Ben Abernathy described this storyline as a new direction for the Wildstorm Universe:\n\n[T]his direction evolved following our WorldStorm launch a few years ago. Looking at the landscape of the industry, we realized we needed to move our universe in a different direction, something that the “Big Two” couldn’t, or wouldn’t, do for a long period of time. And we decided that direction should be toward a sci-fi/horror direction of a post-apocalyptic setting (to a degree, an almost logical extension to where the WSU has been headed for years). There have been “visions” of a devastated, bleak future in other mainstream super-hero books, but nothing with the lasting impact or direction that the World’s End books will be tackling.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2111773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111773", "title": "Ćevapi", "text": "Ćevapi\n\nĆevapi () or ćevapčići (formal diminutive, , ) is a grilled dish of minced meat, a type of kebab, found traditionally in the countries of southeastern Europe (the Balkans). They are considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and are also common in Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, Slovenia, as well as in Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria and Austria.\n\nĆevapi has its origins in the Balkans during the Ottoman period, and represents a regional speciality similar to the köfte kebab.\n\nThey are usually served in groups of five to ten pieces on a plate or in a flatbread (\"lepinje\" or \"somun\"), often with chopped onions, sour cream, kajmak, ajvar, feta cheese, minced red pepper and salt. Bosnian ćevapi are made from two types of minced beef meat, hand-mixed and formed with a funnel, while formed ćevapi are grilled. Serb ćevapčići are made of either beef, lamb or pork or mixed.\n\nThe word \"ćevap\" comes from Turkish \"kebab\", sometimes with the South Slavic diminutive ending \"-čići\" (Albanian: \"Qebapa/Qofte\"; Croatian: \"ćevapčići/ćevapi\"; Slovene: \"čevapčiči/čevapi\"; Bosnian, '; , '; , \"\", , ). The word ćevapi is plural; the singular form ćevap is rarely used, as a typical serving consists of several ćevapi.\n\nDuring the Ottoman administration, \"hajduks\" (rebels, outlaws) made the \"hajdučki ćevap\" (\"hajduk cevap\"), which was easy to make, out of pieces of meat and smoked lard on a skewer roasted over fire. The recipe of the \"Leskovački ćevap\" (\"Leskovac ćevap\"), a local specialty of Serbia, was based on traditional Pljeskavica (meat patty), formed as sausage (\"ćevap\"). Leskovac has a long history of grill shops. In Belgrade, ćevapčići first came from Leskovac in the 1860s, into the kafana \"Rajić\" at the Great Marketplace (today Studentski Trg), from where they quickly spread across the city, and subsequently, country. The industry quickly multiplied, as ćevapčići was the drinking public's favourite.\n\nThe ćevapčići were served at shops, known as \"ćevabdžija\" ( \"ćevabdžije\"). A 1927–28 study in Belgrade told that people either ate in the restaurant or outside (\"on the kaldrma\"), often take-away. The shops served from early morning to 10 AM, while often the dish was bought for breakfast.\n\nBefore the 1930s, they spread to the rest of Yugoslavia, including east of Serbia and the Macedonia region. By 1932, ćevapčići were regarded a local specialty in southern Serbia, Skopje and Peć. In 1933, the first street food vendor appeared in Maribor, Slovenia, who came from Leskovac, and served grilled meat, including ćevapčići. In 1940, ten pieces cost one Yugoslav dinar. In the second half of the 20th century, ćevapčići and other Oriental dishes entered Croatian cuisine. The Leskovac-styled grilled meat, including ćevapčići, have today become part of everyday-diet in Slovenia. Today, ćevapčići are found outside former Yugoslavia in the diaspora communities.\n\nToday, the grill shops are known as \"ćevabdžinica\" (pl. \"ćevabdžinice\").\n\nLeskovac organizes an annual grill festival, the Leskovac Grill Festival, as a showcase of ćevapi and other grilled meat.\n\nThey are usually served of 5-10 pieces on a plate or in a flatbread (\"lepinje\" or \"somun\"), often with chopped onions, sour cream, kajmak, ajvar, cottage cheese, minced red pepper and salt. Bosnian-type ćevapi (halal) are made from two types of minced beef meat, hand mixed and formed with a funnel, while formed ćevapi are grilled. Serbian-type ćevapi (ćevapčići) are made of either beef, lamb or pork, or mixed.\n\nIn Austria, Czech Republic and Slovakia, čevapčiči is generally served with mustard mixed with finely chopped raw onions and potatoes or French fries, in a common fast food manner.\n\n\nThere are variations in meat content and seasoning. The dish is kept simple, and traditionally served in somun with onions and/or kajmak and yogurt as appetizer.\n\n\n"}
