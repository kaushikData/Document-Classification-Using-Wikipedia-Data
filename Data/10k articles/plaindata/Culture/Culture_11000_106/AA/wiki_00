{"id": "1939093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939093", "title": "Adult animation", "text": "Adult animation\n\nAdult animation, adult cartoon or mature animation, is any type of animated motion work that is mainly targeted towards adults and older adolescents, as opposed to children or all-ages audiences. Works in this genre may be considered adult for any number of reasons, such as complex themes, sexual or suggestive content, graphic violence, profane language or dark humor. Works in this genre may explore philosophical, political, or social issues. Some productions are noted for sophisticated and/or experimental storytelling and animation techniques.\n\nIn the United States, before the enforcement of the Hays Code, some cartoon shorts contained humor that was aimed at adult audience members rather than children. Following the introduction of the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system, independent animation producers attempted to establish an alternative to mainstream animation. Initially, few animation studios in the United States attempted to produce animation for adult audiences, but later examples of animation produced for adults would gain mainstream attention and success.\n\nThe earliest cartoon series were based upon popular comic strips, and were directed at family audiences. Most animation produced during the silent film era was not intended to be shown to any specific age group, but occasionally contained humor that was directed at adult audience members, including risqué jokes. The assumed audience of these early cartoons, particularly \"Looney Tunes\", has alternated from their initial unspecific audience, to children, and back to general audiences as \"classics\". The earliest known instance of censorship in animation occurred when the censorship board of Pennsylvania requested that references to bootlegging be removed from Walt Disney's 1925 short \"Alice Solves a Puzzle\". One of the earliest animated pornographic films was \"Eveready Harton in Buried Treasure\", produced circa 1928. It has often been suggested that the film was produced for a private party in honor of Winsor McCay. Rumors suggest that the film was developed in Cuba years after it was completed, because no lab in New York City would process the film. When a print was screened in San Francisco in the late 1970s, the program notes attributed the animation to George Stallings, George Canata, Rudy Zamora, Sr. and Walter Lantz.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association of America, then known as the Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors Association, was established in 1922 as the result of public objection to adult content in films, and a series of guidelines were established, suggesting content that should not be portrayed in films. Until the Hays Code was enforced, many animated shorts featured suggestive content, including sexual innuendo, references to alcohol and drug use, and mild profanity. In the 1933 short \"Bosko's Picture Show\", Bosko appears to use adult words, although it has also been suggested that the character is saying \"fox\", or even \"mug\".\n\nThe Betty Boop series was known for its use of jokes that would eventually be considered taboo following the enforcement of the Hays Code, including the use of nudity. Betty Boop was initially drawn as a dog, and cast as the girlfriend of another Fleischer character, Bimbo. Betty was redesigned as a human, but the series continued to suggest a love relationship between the two that went farther than the normal relationship between humans and their pets. The short \"Is My Palm Read\" contains a scene in which Betty is shown as a child between the ages of four and five, bathing in the nude. In the 1970s, this scene was shown out of context in performances by The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo. Concert audiences were not aware that Betty was supposed to be a baby in the sequence.\n\nAnother short, \"Bamboo Isle\", contains a sequence in which Betty dances the hula topless, wearing only a lei over her breasts and a grass skirt. According to animator Shamus Culhane, Fleischer Studios and Paramount Pictures were shocked by the sequence, but because it was a major sequence, it could not be cut out of the film. Culhane also states that he does not remember any instance in which the film was censored. Betty’s hula animation was reused for a cameo appearance with Popeye the Sailor in his self-titled animated debut short.\n\nFollowing the enforcement of the Hays Code, Betty's clothing was redesigned, and all future shorts portrayed her with a longer dress which did not portray her physique and sexuality. Shorts produced following the enforcement of the Hays Code were also less surreal in nature, and Betty was portrayed as a rational adult.\n\nBy 1968, the Hays Office had been eliminated, and the former guidelines were replaced by the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. The lifting of the Code meant that animated features from other countries could be distributed without censorship, and that censorship would not be required for American productions. Some underground cartoon features from the late 1960s were also aimed at an adult audience, such as \"Bambi Meets Godzilla\" (1968), and the anti-war films \"Escalation\" (1968), and \"Mickey Mouse in Vietnam\" (1969). \"Escalation\" in particular is interesting because it was made by Disney animator Ward Kimball, independently from the Disney Studios. Film producer John Magnuson completed an animated short based upon an audio recording of a comedy routine by Lenny Bruce titled \"Thank You Mask Man\" (1971), in which The Lone Ranger shocks the residents of the town he saves when he tells them that he wants to have sex with Tonto. The short was made by San Francisco-based company Imagination, Inc. and directed by Jeff Hale, a former member of the National Film Board of Canada. The film was scheduled to premiere on the opening night of \"Z\", as a supplement preceding the main feature, but was not shown. According to a former staff member of the festival, Magnuson ran up the aisle and shouted \"They crucified Lenny when he was alive and now that he is dead they are screwing him again!\" The festival's director told Magnuson that the producer of \"Z\" did not want any short shown that night. Rumors suggested that the wife of one of the festival's financiers hated Bruce, and threatened to withdraw her husband's money if the short was screened. \"Thank You Mask Man\" was later shown in art house screenings, and gained a following, but screenings did not perform well enough financially for Magnuson to profit from the film.\n\nBy the late-1960s, animator Ralph Bakshi felt that he could not continue to produce the same kind of animation as he had in the past. Bakshi was quoted in a 1971 article for the \"Los Angeles Times\" as saying that the idea of \"grown men sitting in cubicles drawing butterflies floating over a field of flowers, while American planes are dropping bombs in Vietnam and kids are marching in the streets, is ludicrous.\" With producer Steve Krantz, Bakshi founded his own studio, Bakshi Productions, establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators. He also paid his employees a higher salary than any other studio at that time.\n\nIn 1969, Ralph's Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and \"Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse\", a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. Bakshi soon developed \"Heavy Traffic\", a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi came across a copy of Robert Crumb's \"Fritz the Cat\". Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film.\n\n\"Fritz the Cat\" was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the MPAA, and the highest grossing independent animated film of all time. While the film is widely noted in its innovation for featuring content that had not been portrayed in American animation before, such as explicit sexuality and violence, the film also offered commercial potential for alternative and independent animated films in the United States, as the film offered a mature, satirical portrayal of the 1960s, including portrayal of drug use, political tension and race relations. Bakshi has been credited for playing an important role in establishing animation as a medium where any story can be told, rather than a medium for children. As a result of the acceptance of Bakshi's features, the director suggested that \"War and Peace\" could be produced as an animated film.\n\nBecause of the perception that \"Fritz the Cat\" was pornographic, Krantz attempted to appeal the film's rating, but the MPAA refused to hear the appeal. Praise from \"Rolling Stone\" and \"The New York Times\", and the film's acceptance into the 1972 Cannes Film Festival cleared up previous misconceptions. Bakshi then simultaneously directed a number of animated films, starting with \"Heavy Traffic\". Krantz was nervous about showing too much nudity and sexual content, and had several versions of some scenes animated. Thanks to \"Heavy Traffic\", Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since Walt Disney to have two financially successful films released back-to-back. Although the film was critically praised, it was banned by the film censorship board in the province of Alberta, Canada when it was originally released.\n\nBakshi's next film, \"Coonskin\" was produced by Albert S. Ruddy. The film, culled from Bakshi's interest in African-American history in America, was an attack on racism and racist stereotypes. Bakshi hired several African-American animators to work on \"Coonskin\" and another feature, \"Hey Good Lookin'\", including Brenda Banks, the first African-American female animator. After the release was stalled by protests from the Congress of Racial Equality, which accused both the film and Bakshi himself of being racist, the film was given limited distribution, advertised as an exploitation film, and soon disappeared from theaters.\n\nBakshi avoided controversy by producing fantasy films, including \"Wizards\", \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"Fire and Ice\". Bakshi did not produce another animated feature film after the 1992 release of \"Cool World\". In 2015, after securing funding through a Kickstarter campaign, he released the short film \"Last Days of Coney Island\" on the internet.\n\nAlthough some adult-oriented animated films achieved success, very few animation studios in the United States produced explicitly adult animation during the 1970s, and much of the adult-oriented animation produced in the 1980s and 1990s was critically and commercially unsuccessful. Krantz produced \"The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat\" without Bakshi's involvement, and it was released in June 1974 to negative reviews. Charles Swenson developed \"Down and Dirty Duck\" as a project for Flo and Eddie (Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, formerly of The Turtles and The Mothers of Invention) under the title \"Cheap!\" The film, produced by Roger Corman, was released on June 13, 1977 under the title \"Dirty Duck\", and received negative reviews. \n\nHowever, in 1987, Italian-Canadian cartoonist Danny Antonucci, who would later create the television series \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\" for Cartoon Network, released a successful short film titled \"Lupo the Butcher\". The short follows the story of a psychotic, temperamental butcher who swears at his meat when the smallest things go wrong. Produced by Marv Newland's International Rocketship Limited, \"Lupo the Butcher\" has become a cult following and opened floodgates to irreverent adult animated series.\n\nAnimated films portraying serious stories began to regain notice from mainstream audiences in the beginning of the 21st century. \"Persepolis\", a 2007 adaptation of Marjane Satrapi's autobiographical graphic novel, won the Jury Prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and was later nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. The Iranian government protested the film's inclusion in the Festival, but later allowed the film to be screened in a censored version, which altered the film's sexual content. The 2008 Israeli film \"Waltz with Bashir\", an animated documentary involving the 1982 Lebanon War, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nThe 2016 film \"\" was the first film in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies series and the first animated Batman film to receive an R rating from the MPAA, with Warner Bros. Animation president Sam Register explaining, \"From the start of production, we encouraged producer Bruce Timm and our team at Warner Bros. Animation to remain faithful to the original story—regardless of the eventual MPAA rating... We felt it was our responsibility to present our core audience—the comics-loving community—with an animated film that authentically represented the tale they know all too well.\" The film was released in a limited theatrical screening on July 25, 2016. \"Sausage Party\", released in 2016, became the first CGI film to be rated R by the MPAA. It grossed over $140 million worldwide, becoming the most successful R-rated animated film of all time.\n\nIn 1988, San Francisco exhibitor Expanded Cinema screened a compilation of adult-oriented animated shorts under the title \"Outrageous Animation\". Advertising the package as containing \"the wildest cartoons ever\", the screenings contained shorts produced outside the United States, as well as independently produced American shorts. Reviews of the festival were mixed. \"San Francisco Chronicle\" writer Mick LaSalle hated almost everything screened at the festival, with the exception of Bill Plympton's \"One of Those Days\". In \"The San Francisco Examiner\", David Armstrong gave the show a three-star review and described the films screened as having \"some of the rude vitality of the great old Warner Bros. cartoons —and a good deal of the sexual explicitness denied those old favorites from a more cautious age.\"\n\nIn 1990, Mellow Manor Productions began screening films under the title \"Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation\". Founders Craig \"Spike\" Decker and Mike Gribble promoted their festival by handing out flyers on the streets rather than with traditional promotional techniques. In 1991, Decker and Gribble screened their first \"All Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation\", promising \"wild and zany films that could never be shown to our 'normal audience'\". The festival screened newer independent shorts, as well as older shorts such as \"Bambi Meets Godzilla\", and \"Thank You Mask Man\". Although the festival promoted works by animators who would later gain mainstream success, such as Bill Plympton, Mike Judge, Trey Parker and Don Hertzfeldt, many reviewers dismissed the bulk of the programming as shock value.\n\nIn 2003, Judge and Hertzfeldt created a new touring festival of animation marketed towards adults and college students. The Animation Show brought animated shorts into more North American theaters than any previous commercial festival.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1974, Hanna-Barbera produced \"Wait Till Your Father Gets Home\", an adult-oriented sitcom in the style of \"All in the Family\". The series dealt with subjects such as feminism and the generation gap.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of animated television programs appeared which challenged the Standards & Practices guidelines, including \"The Simpsons\", \"Beavis and Butt-Head\", \"The Critic\", \"The Brothers Grunt\" and \"Duckman\".\n\n\"The Tracey Ullman Show\" aired in prime time, therefore it was not censored as much as programs intended to air on Saturday mornings. In addition to the show's portrayal of brief nudity and mild language, the series has dealt with mature themes and subjects such as death, gambling addiction, religion and suicide.\n\nIn 1989, \"The Simpsons\" began airing on Fox Broadcasting Company in prime time, becoming a massive hit among American audiences. In response, ABC, CBS and NBC each developed animated series to air in prime time, but none of the shows were successful. One series, \"Capitol Critters\", focused on subjects such as gun control, interracial violence and political corruption. In his review of the series, \"Variety\" critic Brian Lowry wrote that he felt that the series' approach was \"muddled\", and that \"the bland central character and cartoonish elements [...] will likely be off-putting to many adults, who won't find the political satire biting enough to merit their continued attention. Similarly, kids probably won't be as smitten with the cartoon aspects or look\". The series was cancelled after one month. \"The Critic\" was somewhat more successful, but achieved low ratings because of ABC's sporadic scheduling, and was cancelled by the network. Fox picked up the series, but cancelled it four months later. While Fox allowed \"The Simpsons\" to portray animated depictions of human buttocks, ABC would not allow similar scenes to appear on \"The Critic\".\n\n\"Beavis and Butt-head\" was controversial for its portrayal of brief nudity, profanity and violence. Although the series was intended for adult audiences, it was shown in the afternoons, and multiple parents claimed that their children had imitated the show's characters. The first instance of such an accusation occurred when animal lovers in Santa Cruz, California claimed that someone had blown up a cat after seeing Beavis and Butt-head perform this act on television. In actuality, no such scene had ever been portrayed. When a five-year-old boy in Ohio set his bed on fire, killing his two-year-old sister, critics claimed that the incident was the result of an episode involving fire, although it has never been proven that the boy had ever watched the series. MTV responded by moving the series to a later airtime and adding disclaimers to future episodes stating explicitly not to imitate the actions of the characters, as well as removing all references to fire from the episodes.\n\nDiscussions involving a series based upon Trey Parker and Matt Stone's video Christmas card, \"The Spirit of Christmas\", led HBO to contact Ralph Bakshi in order to produce an animated series targeted specifically toward adults. Bakshi enlisted a team of writers, including his son, Preston, to develop \"[Spicy Detective\", later renamed \"Spicy City\", an anthology series set in a noir-ish, technology-driven future. Each episode featuring a different story narrated by a female host named Raven, voiced by Michelle Phillips. The series premiered in July 1997, beating \"South Park\" to television by over a month and becoming the first \"adults only\" cartoon series. Although critical reaction was mixed and largely unfavorable, \"Spicy City\" received acceptable ratings. A second season was approved, but the network wanted to fire Bakshi's writing team and hire professional Los Angeles screenwriters. When Bakshi refused to cooperate with the network, the series was canceled.\n\nIn 2001, Time Warner established Adult Swim as a programming block on Cartoon Network, aimed for an adult audience. Its schedule currently includes original programs such as \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\", \"Squidbillies\" and \"Rick and Morty\", and reruns of syndicated programs such as \"Family Guy\", \"American Dad!\" and \"King of the Hill\" (all of which had their original run on Fox).\n\nAmerican audiences have become more accepting of adult-oriented animation through the popularity of American-produced comedic television shows. Dramatic series such as \"Aeon Flux\" and \"Invasion America\" are less common, and still rarely successful.\n\nIn 1954, a British film studio produced an animated adaptation of George Orwell's novel \"Animal Farm\". This film is believed to have been one of the earliest examples of British animation, and like the book is meant to be a portrayal or critique of Stalinism with characters serving as analogues to figures from the Russian Revolution of 1917.\n\nFor many years, it had been problematic to import films that did not meet the approval of the United States Customs Service. In 1972, the Customs Service refused entry of a short film titled \"Sinderella\", depicting scenes of sexual intercourse between characters based upon \"Cinderella\", \"Little Red Riding Hood\", \"Puss in Boots\", \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\" and \"Prince Charming\". The film was seized as obscene material, and its distributor filed a court case and an appeal in 1974, but lost both.\n\nIn 1973, Rene Laloux directed \"La Planète sauvage\" based on the French science fiction novel \"Oms en série\" by Stefan Wul. It has been televised in the United States and United Kingdom as \"Fantastic Planet\", and several DVD editions have been released. Also in 1973, an Italian film, \"King Dick\", was released and became a cult classic in the United Kingdom. A West German short called \"Snow White and the Seven Perverts\" (\"Schneeflittchen unter die Sieben Bergen\") also appeared. This little film mostly parodies Snow White and has been included as part of other compilation films.\n\nThe first foreign animated feature to receive both an X rating and wide distribution in the United States was \"\". A dubbed version, which featured new dialogue performed by American actors and comedians such as John Belushi, Adolph Caesar, Brian Doyle-Murray, Judy Graubart, Bill Murray and Johnny Weissmuller Jr., received an R rating. According to distributor Stuart S. Shapiro, the X rating hurt the film's distribution, but the dubbed version \"took the bite out of the film. It lost its outrageousness.\" \"Tarzoon\" was banned by the New Zealand Board of Censors in 1980.\n\nIn England, Martin Rosen directed two animated features based on the novels of Richard Adams: \"Watership Down\" in 1978, and \"The Plague Dogs\" in 1982. Both films deal with adult themes: \"Watership Down\", the negotiation of leadership to organize an exodus away from persecution, and \"The Plague Dogs\" on animal testing.\n\n\"Pink Floyd – The Wall\", an adaptation of Pink Floyd's concept album of the same name, featured fifteen minutes of painstaking traditional animation in addition to numerous live-action sequences; although the film was not by any stretch pornographic, it was an adult film (with numerous references to drugs, mental illness and sex, along with one animated sequence portraying a character talking out of his rectum and having a scrotum for a beard) and received an R rating when imported to the United States.\nIn 1986, England produced yet another politically-themed animation, \"When the Wind Blows\", about an older couple whose home undergoes a nuclear attack.\n\n\"Werner\" - a German animated film based on the comic book. In an episode of many characters use profanity and flip the bird.\n\n\"Felidae\" is a 1994 German animated neo-noir crime film based on Akif Pirinçci's 1989 novel of the same name. It features graphic violent and sexual content involving animals.\n\nSoyuzmultfilm produced children's animation as well as animations aimed more at adults, such as Film, Film, Film, a satirical animation about the film industry in the Soviet Union, and Pomorskaya Byl, a serious account of the death of two Pomor fishermen, stranded in the middle of the White Sea.\n\nAdult animation is known in Japan as (adult anime). In both English and Japanese, the word \"adult\" may carry connotations of a sexual nature, but anime on serious topics such as \"Akira\" or \"Ghost in the Shell\" often get referred to as \"adult\" in Japan as well, even when sex is not a key part of the story.\n\nAnimated works of an erotic nature have come to be described in western fandom as \"hentai\", the Japanese word for \"perverted\", while in Japan they are more likely to be referred to as (R-18 anime) or (erotic anime). Although some associate all anime with sexual content, hentai only makes up a very small portion of the Japanese animation industry. As the result of the misconceptions about Japanese animation, some video stores outside Japan have classified children's anime as for adults only. Many video stores have also categorized all adult-oriented animation as anime, including the works of Ralph Bakshi, the French animated film \"Fantastic Planet\", the Canadian animated film \"Heavy Metal\" and the HBO television series \"Todd McFarlane's Spawn\". In the case of \"Spawn\", Todd McFarlane directly listed anime as an influence, particularly Katsuhiro Otomo's \"Akira\", and stated his hope that the show would help encourage the rise of adult animation on North American networks. This in part lead to the involvement of the Japanese studio Madhouse in the production, in an attempt to \"combine\" the Eastern and Western styles.\nSome of the earliest manga magazines were aimed at adults, and this provided a prime source as the basis for adult anime works. \"Weekly Manga Times\" began publication in 1956, and would be followed by \"Weekly Manga Goraku\" (1964), and \"Manga Action\" (1967). Anime works based on adult manga include \"Berserk\", \"Hellsing Ultimate\", \"Maison Ikkoku\", \"Mushishi\", \"Golden Boy\" and \"Tokyo Daigaku Monogatari\".\nIn 1969, Osamu Tezuka and Eiichi Yamamoto released \"Senya Ichiya Monogatari\" (千夜一夜物語) the first of a series of three animated feature films aimed at an adult audience. It was dubbed and released in the United States as \"One Thousand and One Arabian Nights\". Osamu Tezuka and Eiichi Yamamoto collaborated on the second film in the Animerama series \"Kureopatora\" (クレオパトラ) released in the United States as \"Cleopatra: Queen of Sex\". The third film \"Kanashimi no Beradonna\" (哀しみのベラドンナ) was directed by Eiichi Yamamoto alone. It was entered in the Berlin International Film Festival, but did not achieve commercial success.\nIn 1984, original video animation (OVA) of an erotic nature began to be released, first \"Lolita Anime\" by Wonder Kids based on the manga work of Fumio Nakajima, and then later in the year \"Cream Lemon\", a series which proved to be a big hit in Japan. \"La Blue Girl\" and \"New Angel\" are two other erotic anime to be released in United States and Europe in the early 1990s.\n\n1988 saw the release of \"Akira\" directed by Katsuhiro Otomo which was dubbed and shown in North American theaters, and released on VHS around the world. Its success led to a greater interest in Japanese adult anime in the US, and opened the door for other titles. In 1995, \"Ghost in the Shell\" was released as a feature film, directed by Mamoru Oshii based on the manga by Masamune Shirow. It received critical acclaim in both Japan, and abroad hinting further at the possibilities of adult animation.\nThe North American Adult Swim channel has been airing adult-oriented anime series on Saturday nights: \"Cowboy Bebop\", \"FLCL\", \"\", \"IGPX\" and \"Space Dandy\". Four of the Japanese TV networks have similar late night anime blocks: Fuji Television's \"Noitamina\", Mainichi Broadcasting System's \"Animeism and Anime Shower\", Asahi Broadcasting Corporation's \"Wednesday Anime\" and Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation's \"Manpa\". The programs aired have included \"Angel Heart\", \"Genji Monogatari Sennenki\" and \"Hellsing\".\n\nStarting in 2004, Mahiro Maeda directed a multi-episode anime adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' novel as \"\". It was aired on Animax in Asia, and FUNimation in the United States, and received critical acclaim in the anime press.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "644894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=644894", "title": "Artist collective", "text": "Artist collective\n\nAn artist collective is an initiative that is the result of a group of artists working together, usually under their own management, towards shared aims. The aims of an artist collective can include almost anything that is relevant to the needs of the artist, this can range from purchasing bulk materials, sharing equipment, space or materials, through to following shared ideologies, aesthetic and political views or even living and working together as an extended family. Sharing of ownership, risk, benefits, and status is implied, as opposed to other, more common business structures with an explicit hierarchy of ownership such as an association or a company.\n\nArtist collectives have occurred throughout history, often gathered around central resources, for instance the ancient sculpture workshops at the marble quarries on Milos in Greece and Carrara in Italy. Collectives featured during both the Russian revolution when they were set up by the state in all major communities, and the French Revolution when the Louvre in Paris was occupied as an artist collective.\n\nMore traditional artist collectives tend to be smallish groups of two to eight artists who produce work, either collaboratively or as individuals toward exhibiting together in gallery shows or public spaces. Often an artists collective will maintain a collective space, for exhibiting or as workshop or studio facilities. Some newer, more experimental kinds of groups include intentional networks, anonymous, connector, hidden or nested groups, and groups with unconventional time-scales. Artist collectives may be formed: For economic reasons, to give members volume purchasing power and allow costs of publicity and shows to be shared. For political reasons, to increase local lobbying power for arts infrastructure, to gather behind a cause or belief. For professional reasons, to develop a higher group profile that benefits the individuals by association, to create a hub for curators and commissioners to more easily locate potential talent.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1182", "title": "Athena", "text": "Athena\n\nAthena or Athene, often given the epithet Pallas, is an ancient Greek goddess associated with wisdom, handicraft, and warfare, who was later syncretized with the Roman goddess Minerva. Athena was regarded as the patron and protectress of various cities across Greece, particularly the city of Athens, from which she most likely received her name. She is usually shown in art wearing a helmet and holding a spear. Her major symbols include owls, olive trees, snakes, and the Gorgoneion.\n\nFrom her origin as an Aegean palace goddess, Athena was closely associated with the city. She was known as \"Polias\" and \"Poliouchos\" (both derived from \"polis\", meaning \"city-state\"), and her temples were usually located atop the fortified Acropolis in the central part of the city. The Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis is dedicated to her, along with numerous other temples and monuments. As the patron of craft and weaving, Athena was known as \"Ergane\". She was also a warrior goddess, and was believed to lead soldiers into battle as \"Athena Promachos\". Her main festival in Athens was the Panathenaia, which was celebrated during the month of Hekatombaion in midsummer and was the most important festival on the Athenian calendar.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Athena was believed to have been born from the head of her father Zeus. In the founding myth of Athens, Athena bested Poseidon in a competition over patronage of the city by creating the first olive tree. She was known as \"Athena Parthenos\" (\"Athena the Virgin\"), but, in one archaic Attic myth, the god Hephaestus tried and failed to rape her, resulting in Gaia giving birth to Erichthonius, an important Athenian founding hero. Athena was the patron goddess of heroic endeavor; she was believed to have also aided the heroes Perseus, Heracles, Bellerophon, and Jason. Along with Aphrodite and Hera, Athena was one of the three goddesses whose feud resulted in the beginning of the Trojan War. She plays an active role in the \"Iliad\", in which she assists the Achaeans and, in the \"Odyssey\", she is the divine counselor to Odysseus.\n\nIn the later writings of the Roman poet Ovid, Athena was said to have competed against the mortal Arachne in a weaving competition, afterwards transforming Arachne into the first spider; Ovid also describes how she transformed Medusa into a Gorgon after witnessing her being raped by Poseidon in her temple. Since the Renaissance, Athena has become an international symbol of wisdom, the arts, and classical learning. Western artists and allegorists have often used Athena as a symbol of freedom and democracy.\n\nAthena is associated with the city of Athens. The name of the city in ancient Greek is \"Ἀθῆναι\" (\"Athenai\"), a plural toponym, designating the place where—according to myth—she presided over the \"Athenai\", a sisterhood devoted to her worship. In ancient times, scholars argued whether Athena was named after Athens or Athens after Athena. Now scholars generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city; the ending -\"ene\" is common in names of locations, but rare for personal names. Testimonies from different cities in ancient Greece attest that similar city goddesses were worshipped in other cities and, like Athena, took their names from the cities where they were worshipped. For example, in Mycenae there was a goddess called Mykene, whose sisterhood was known as \"Mykenai\", whereas at Thebes an analogous deity was called Thebe, and the city was known under the plural form \"Thebai\" (or Thebes, in English, where the ‘s’ is the plural formation). The name \"Athenai\" is likely of Pre-Greek origin because it contains the presumably Pre-Greek morpheme \"*-ān-\".\n\nIn his dialogue \"Cratylus\", the Greek philosopher Plato (428–347 BC) gives some rather imaginative etymologies of Athena's name, based on the theories of the ancient Athenians and his own etymological speculations:\n\nThus, Plato believed that Athena's name was derived from Greek , \"Atheonóa\"—which the later Greeks rationalised as from the deity's (θεός, \"theós\") mind (νοῦς, \"noũs\"). The second-century AD orator Aelius Aristides attempted to derive natural symbols from the etymological roots of Athena's names to be \"aether\", \"air\", \"earth\", and \"moon\".\n\nAthena was originally the Aegean goddess of the palace, who presided over household crafts and protected the king. A single Mycenaean Greek inscription \"a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja\" /Athana potnia/ appears at Knossos in the Linear B tablets from the Late Minoan II-era \"Room of the Chariot Tablets\"; these comprise the earliest Linear B archive anywhere. Although \"Athana potnia\" is often translated \"Mistress Athena\", it could also mean \"the \"Potnia\" of Athana\", or \"the Lady of Athens\". However, any connection to the city of Athens in the Knossos inscription is uncertain. A sign series \"a-ta-no-dju-wa-ja\" appears in the still undeciphered corpus of Linear A tablets, written in the unclassified Minoan language. This could be connected with the Linear B Mycenaean expressions \"a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja\" and \"di-u-ja\" or \"di-wi-ja\" (\"Diwia\", \"of Zeus\" or, possibly, related to a homonymous goddess), resulting in a translation \"Athena of Zeus\" or \"divine Athena\". Similarly, in the Greek mythology and epic tradition, Athena figures as a daughter of Zeus (Διός θυγάτηρ; \"cfr.\" Dyeus). However, the inscription quoted seems to be very similar to \"a-ta-nū-tī wa-ya\", quoted as SY Za 1 by Jan Best. Best translates the initial \"a-ta-nū-tī\", which is recurrent in line beginnings, as \"I have given\".\n\nA Mycenean fresco depicts two women extending their hands towards a central figure, who is covered by an enormous figure-eight shield; this may depict the warrior-goddess with her \"palladion\", or her palladion in an aniconic representation. In the \"Procession Fresco\" at Knossos, which was reconstructed by the Mycenaeans, two rows of figures carrying vessels seem to meet in front of a central figure, which is probably the Minoan precursor to Athena. The early twentieth-century scholar Martin Persson Nilsson argued that the Minoan snake goddess figurines are early representations of Athena.\n\nNilsson and others have claimed that, in early times, Athena was either an owl herself or a bird goddess in general. In the third book of the \"Odyssey\", she takes the form of a sea-eagle. Proponents of this view argue that she dropped her prophylactic owl-mask before she lost her wings. \"Athena, by the time she appears in art,\" Jane Ellen Harrison remarks, \"has completely shed her animal form, has reduced the shapes she once wore of snake and bird to attributes, but occasionally in black-figure vase-paintings she still appears with wings.\"\n\nIt is generally agreed that the cult of Athena preserves some aspects of the Proto-Indo-European transfunctional goddess. The cult of Athena may have also been influenced by those of Near Eastern warrior goddesses such as the East Semitic Ishtar and the Ugaritic Anat, both of whom were often portrayed bearing arms. Classical scholar Charles Penglase notes that Athena closely resembles Inanna in her role as a \"terrifying warrior goddess\" and that both goddesses were closely linked with creation. Athena's birth from the head of Zeus may be derived from the earlier Sumerian myth of Inanna's descent into and return from the Underworld.\n\nPlato notes that the citizens of Sais in Egypt worshipped a goddess known as Neith, whom he identifies with Athena. Neith was the ancient Egyptian goddess of war and hunting, who was also associated with weaving; her worship began during the Egyptian Pre-Dynastic period. In Greek mythology, Athena was reported to have visited mythological sites in North Africa, including Libya's Triton River and the Phlegraean plain. Based on these similarities, the Sinologist Martin Bernal created the \"Black Athena\" hypothesis, which claimed that Neith was brought to Greece from Egypt, along with \"an enormous number of features of civilization and culture in the third and second millennia\". The \"Black Athena\" hypothesis stirred up widespread controversy near the end of the twentieth century, but it has now been widely rejected by modern scholars.\n\nIn her aspect of \"Athena Polias\", Athena was venerated as the goddess of the city and the protectress of the citadel. In Athens, the Plynteria, or \"Feast of the Bath\", was observed every year at the end of the month of Thargelion. The festival lasted for five days. During this period, the priestesses of Athena, or \"plyntrídes\", performed a cleansing ritual within the Erechtheion, a sanctuary devoted to Athena and Poseidon. Here Athena's statue was undressed, her clothes washed, and body purified. Athena was worshipped at festivals such as Chalceia as \"Athena Ergane\", the patroness of various crafts, especially weaving. She was also the patron of metalworkers and was believed to aid in the forging of armor and weapons. During the late fifth century BC, the role of goddess of philosophy became a major aspect of Athena's cult.\n\nAs \"Athena Promachos\", she was believed to lead soldiers into battle. Athena represented the disciplined, strategic side of war, in contrast to her brother Ares, the patron of violence, bloodlust, and slaughter—\"the raw force of war\". Athena was believed to only support those fighting for a just cause and was thought to view war primarily as a means to resolve conflict. The Greeks regarded Athena with much higher esteem than Ares. Athena was especially worshipped in this role during the festivals of the Panathenaea and Pamboeotia, both of which prominently featured displays of athletic and military prowess. As the patroness of heroes and warriors, Athena was believed to favor those who used cunning and intelligence rather than brute strength.\n\nIn her aspect as a warrior maiden, Athena was known as \"Parthenos\" ( \"virgin\"), because, like her fellow goddesses Artemis and Hestia, she was believed to remain perpetually a virgin. Athena's most famous temple, the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis, takes its name from this title. According to Karl Kerényi, a scholar of Greek mythology, the name \"Parthenos\" is not merely an observation of Athena's virginity, but also a recognition of her role as enforcer of rules of sexual modesty and ritual mystery. Even beyond recognition, the Athenians allotted the goddess value based on this pureness of virginity, which they upheld as a rudiment of female behavior. Kerényi's study and theory of Athena explains her virginal epithet as a result of her relationship to her father Zeus and a vital, cohesive piece of her character throughout the ages. This role is expressed in a number of stories about Athena. Marinus of Neapolis reports that when Christians removed the statue of the goddess from the Parthenon, a beautiful woman appeared in a dream to Proclus, a devotee of Athena, and announced that the \"Athenian Lady\" wished to dwell with him.\n\nAthena was not only the patron goddess of Athens, but also other cities, including Argos, Sparta, Gortyn, Lindos, and Larisa. The various cults of Athena were all branches of her panhellenic cult and often proctored various initiation rites of Grecian youth, such as the passage into citizenship by young men or the passage of young women into marriage. These cults were portals of a uniform socialization, even beyond mainland Greece. Athena was frequently equated with Aphaea, a local goddess of the island of Aegina, originally from Crete and also associated with Artemis and the nymph Britomartis. In Arcadia, she was assimilated with the ancient goddess Alea and worshiped as Athena Alea. Sanctuaries dedicated to Athena Alea were located in the Laconian towns of Mantineia and Tegea. The temple of Athena Alea in Tegea was an important religious center of ancient Greece. The geographer Pausanias was informed that the \"temenos\" had been founded by Aleus.\n\nAthena had a major temple on the Spartan Acropolis, where she was venerated as Poliouchos and \"Khalkíoikos\" (\"of the Brazen House\", often latinized as \"Chalcioecus\"). This epithet may refer to the fact that cult statue held there may have been made of bronze, that the walls of the temple itself may have been made of bronze, or that Athena was the patron of metal-workers. Bells made of terracotta and bronze were used in Sparta as part of Athena's cult. An Ionic-style temple to Athena Polias was built at Priene in the fourth century BC. It was designed by Pytheos of Priene, the same architect who designed the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. The temple was dedicated by Alexander the Great and an inscription from the temple declaring his dedication is now held in the British Museum.\n\nAthena was known as \"Atrytone\" ( \"the Unwearying\"), \"Parthenos\" ( \"Virgin\"), and \"Promachos\" ( \"she who fights in front\"). The epithet \"Polias\" (Πολιάς \"of the city\"), refers to Athena's role as protectress of the city. The epithet \"Ergane\" (Εργάνη \"the Industrious\") pointed her out as the patron of craftsmen and artisans. Burkert notes that the Athenians sometimes simply called Athena \"the Goddess\", \"hē theós\" (ἡ θεός), certainly an ancient title. After serving as the judge at the trial of Orestes in which he was acquitted of having murdered his mother Clytemnestra, Athena won the epithet \"Areia\" (Αρεία).\n\nAthena was sometimes given the epithet \"Hippia\" (Ἵππια \"of the horses\", \"equestrian\"), referring to her invention of the bit, bridle, chariot, and wagon. The Greek geographer Pausanias mentions in his \"Guide to Greece\" that the temple of Athena \"Chalinitis\" (\"the bridler\") in Corinth was located near the tomb of Medea's children. Other epithets include Ageleia, Itonia and \"Aethyia\", under which she was worshiped in Megara. The word \"aíthyia\" () signifies a \"diver\", also some diving bird species (possibly the shearwater) and figuratively, a \"ship\", so the name must reference Athena teaching the art of shipbuilding or navigation. In a temple at Phrixa in Elis, reportedly built by Clymenus, she was known as \"Cydonia\" (Κυδωνία).\n\nThe Greek biographer Plutarch (46–120 AD) refers to an instance during the Parthenon's construction of her being called \"Athena Hygieia\" (Ὑγίεια, i. e. personified \"Health\"):\n"}

The film is often compared to \"Koyaanisqatsi\", the first of the Qatsi films by Godfrey Reggio for which Fricke served as the cinematographer. It is also the most recent film to be photographed in the 70mm Todd-AO format, and the first film ever to be restored and scanned at 8K resolution.\n\n\"Baraka\" is a documentary film with no narrative or voice-over. It explores themes via a compilation of natural events, life, human activities and technological phenomena shot in 24 countries on six continents over a 14-month period.\n\nThe film is Ron Fricke's follow-up to Godfrey Reggio's similar non-verbal documentary film \"Koyaanisqatsi\". Fricke was cinematographer and collaborator on Reggio's film, and for \"Baraka\" he struck out on his own to polish and expand the photographic techniques used on \"Koyaanisqatsi\". Shot in 70mm, it includes a mixture of photographic styles including slow motion and time-lapse. Two camera systems were used to achieve this. A Todd-AO system was used to shoot conventional frame rates, but to execute the film's time-lapse sequences Fricke had a special camera built that combined time-lapse photography with perfectly controlled movements.\n\nLocations featured include the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the Ryoan temple in Kyoto, Lake Natron in Tanzania, burning oil fields in Kuwait, the smouldering precipice of an active volcano, a busy subway terminal, tribal celebrations of the Maasai in Kenya, and chanting monks in the Dip Tse Chok Ling monastery.\n\nThe film features a number of long tracking shots through various settings, including Auschwitz and Tuol Sleng, over photos of the people involved, past skulls stacked in a room, to a spread of bones. It suggests a universal cultural perspective: a shot of an elaborate tattoo on a bathing Japanese yakuza precedes a view of tribal paint.\n\nThe score is by Michael Stearns and features music by, among others, Dead Can Dance, L. Subramaniam, Ciro Hurtado, Inkuyo, Brother, Anugama & Sebastiano, and David Hykes.\n\nFollowing previous DVD releases, in 2007 the original 65 mm negative was re-scanned at 8K resolution with equipment designed specifically for \"Baraka\" at FotoKem Laboratories. The automated 8K film scanner, operating continuously, took more than three weeks to finish scanning more than 150,000 frames (taking approximately 12–13 seconds to scan each frame), producing over 30 terabytes of image data in total. After a 16-month digital intermediate process, including a 96 kHz/24 bit audio remaster by Stearns for the DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack of the film, the result was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in October 2008. At the time, project supervisor Andrew Oran described the reissue of \"Baraka\" as \"arguably the highest quality DVD that's ever been made\". \"Chicago Sun-Times\" critic Roger Ebert described the Blu-ray release as \"the finest video disc I have ever viewed or ever imagined.\"\n\nA sequel to \"Baraka\", \"Samsara\", made by the same filmmakers, premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and released internationally in August 2012. Also shot in 70mm, \"Samsara\" explores an arguably darker, updated version of many of the same themes as \"Baraka\".\n\n\"Baraka\" has a score of 81% off Rotten Tomatoes out of 26 reviews. Roger Ebert included the film in his \"Great Movies\" list, writing that \"If man sends another Voyager to the distant stars and it can carry only one film on board, that film might be \"Baraka\".\"\n\nThe movie was filmed at 152 locations in 23 countries. Some locations include: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Ecuador, Egypt, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Israel, Kenya, Kuwait, Nepal, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, United States and Vatican City.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A primary school teacher by profession, Soriano developed the idea after witnessing first-hand the power reading had on his students, most of whom had lived through intense life conflicts at a young age. Starting in the late 1990s, Soriano traveled to communities in Colombia's Caribbean Sea hinterlands with a portable library, which began with 70 books.\n\nSoriano wrote to Juan Gossaín, a Colombian journalist and writer, after having heard him read excerpts from his novel \"The Ballad of Maria Abdala\" on a radio program. Soriano asked Gossaín for a copy of his book to be distributed on the Biblioburro, details that Gossaín broadcast on his radio program. The response created a flood of book donations and Soriano's collection soon expanded to 4,800 volumes. Currently, construction of a small library building funded by a local financial company is half-finished due to lack of funds. Additional funding is also provided by the director of a community library, located nearly from the Caribbean shore in Santa Maria, who hired Soriano as a satellite employee in order to share a portion of its US$7,000 annual budget.\n\nChildren's adventure stories have remained one of the most popular items distributed by the Biblioburros. In addition to encyclopedia volumes, novels, and medical texts, other items distributed by the Biblioburro include Horacio Quiroga's animal fable \"Anaconda\", the Dictionary of the Spanish Language of the Royal Spanish Academy (\"Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española\") and a number of \"Time–Life\" travel pictorial books. Books lost from the collection include a sex education manual and a copy of Laura Esquivel's 1989 novel \"Like Water for Chocolate\", both of which were not returned by borrowers.

It is loosely based on Doctor Syn, created by Russell Thorndike, and stars Peter Cushing, Yvonne Romain and Patrick Allen.\n\nIn 1776, a mulatto sailor (Milton Reid) is marooned on an island after assaulting the wife of pirate captain Nathaniel Clegg.\n\nBy 1792, Clegg has supposedly been captured by the Royal Navy and hanged. His resting place is the coastal village of Dymchurch on the Romney Marsh. The surrounding countryside is home to the \"Marsh Phantoms\": figures on horseback who ride by night and bring terror to the village.\n\nCaptain Collier (Patrick Allen) and his band of sailors arrive in Dymchurch to investigate reports that the locals are involved in the smuggling of alcohol from France. They are accompanied by the mulatto, mute after his tongue was cut out sixteen years earlier, whom Collier saved from death and now keeps as a slave. As Collier's men ransack an ale house run by Rash (Martin Benson) and his ward Imogène (Yvonne Romain), the mulatto uncovers a hidden cellar. Ostensibly a varnish store, this is connected by a secret passageway to the home of coffin-maker Jeremiah Mipps (Michael Ripper), which serves as the smugglers' headquarters. The smugglers are led by the village parson Dr Blyss (Peter Cushing), whom the mulatto inexplicably attacks before being subdued by the sailors.\n\nThat night, the smugglers succeed in transporting a consignment to a nearby windmill for onward shipment, although squire's son Harry (Oliver Reed), Imogène's secret fiancé, is wounded when he is shot in the arm by the pursuing Collier. Back at the ale house, Rash kills one of the sailors to prevent the smuggling operation from being exposed. This frees the mulatto, who leaves for the churchyard to break open Clegg's grave. Collier, who spent years chasing Clegg, becomes suspicious of Blyss when the mulatto later makes a second attempt on the parson's life.\n\nAt Blyss's house, Rash finds Clegg's last will and testament. Learning that Imogène is Clegg's daughter, he angrily disowns her. While consoling Imogène, Harry is arrested by Collier when the captain notices the young man's bandaged arm. Harry is led away to Collier's ship as a hostage but escapes when the Marsh Phantoms appear, distracting the sailors. The Phantoms, who are actually villagers in disguise, take Harry and Imogène to the church, where they are hurriedly married by Blyss before leaving to start their life together.\n\nCollier arrives at the church and announces that Clegg's grave is empty. He then tears off Blyss's collar to reveal the rope burns from an unsuccessful hanging, exposing the parson as Clegg. Clegg declares that his executioner spared his life and that he wished only to help the inhabitants of Dymchurch live comfortably. A struggle breaks out between the villagers and the sailors, enabling Clegg to flee with Mipps via the secret passageway. However, on emerging at the coffin-maker's house they run into the mulatto, who has murdered Rash and fatally impales Clegg with a spear before being shot dead by Mipps. In the film's closing scene, the villagers look on and Collier and the sailors salute as Mipps sorrowfully places Clegg's body in the open grave.\n\nIn North America, the film was released on 6 September 2005 along with seven other Hammer horror films on the 4-DVD set \"The Hammer Horror Series\" (ASIN: B0009X770O), which is part of MCA-Universal's \"Franchise Collection\". This set was re-released on Blu-ray September 13, 2016.\n\nA Blu-ray was released in the UK on 23 June 2014 by Final Cut Entertainment.\n\n\"Variety\" was moderately positive, writing that the film had a \"good\" screenplay and \"savvy\" direction, \"and the range of technical credits are all on the plus side, especially Arthur Grant's photography.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" was negative, writing, \"The script is feeble, the acting, apart from Patrick Allen's forceful hero, uninspired, and the obsession with injury, degradation and death more dispiriting than ever.\"\n\nAmong later reviews, author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three and a half out of four stars, calling it \"good fun with some scary moments.\" Donald Guarisco from Allmovie called it \"one of the best Hammer Films productions\", praising the film's imaginative script, and colorful characterizations.\n"}

{"id": "21992553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21992553", "title": "Contemporary harpsichord", "text": "Contemporary harpsichord\n\nThe harpsichord was largely obsolete, and seldom played, during a period lasting from the late 18th century to the early 20th. The instrument was successfully revived during the 20th century, first in an ahistorical form strongly influenced by the piano, then with historically more faithful instruments. The revival was the joint work of performers, builders, and composers who wrote new harpsichord pieces. However the harpsichord never completely disappeared from the public eye as it was used through the mid-19th century for basso continuendo because despite its low volume, it had considerable power to \"cut through\" the orchestra. The earliest revival efforts began in the mid-19th century due to its increasingly infrequent usage and there was concern that the instrument could become a forgotten relic of the past.\n\nIn the earlier stages, 20th-century harpsichords were heavily influenced by the technology of the modern piano, and usually included metal framing (which was entirely absent in historical instruments). It was felt that such construction would increase the stability of tuning. Since heavy framing tends to stifle harpsichord sound, instruments were bolstered by other means, notably the addition of a 16' stop (an additional set of strings that played an octave below normal pitch); such stops were somewhat unusual in the historical period but became widespread in the first half of the 20th century. An example was the harpsichord produced by Pleyel et Cie at the request of Landowska.\n\nStarting in the mid-20th century, instruments were introduced whose construction followed historical principles, with thinner cases, historical dispositions (arrangements of choirs of strings) and no metal framing. Among the leaders of this shift were Frank Hubbard, William Dowd, and Martin Skowroneck. With time, such instruments came to dominate the scene, and the older heavy-frame instruments are almost never manufactured today. They retain historical value, however, since they were the instruments that early to mid-20th-century composers had in mind when they wrote their works.\n\nThe transition of harpsichord building toward historicist principles is covered in detail by Hubbard (1965), Zuckermann (1969), and Kottick (2003), cited below.\n\nAmong the performers who propelled the revival of the harpsichord have been the following (listed by date of birth):\n\n\nLandowska and also Elisabeth Chojnacka (1939-2017) achieved particular reputations for the performance of new music for the harpsichord.\n\nIn the 20th century, classical composers returned to the harpsichord as they sought out variation in the sounds available to them. Under the influence of Arnold Dolmetsch, the harpsichordists Violet Gordon-Woodhouse (1872–1951) and in France, Wanda Landowska (1879–1959), were at the forefront of the instrument's renaissance.\n\nConcertos for the instrument were written by Francis Poulenc (the \"Concert champêtre\", 1927–28), Manuel de Falla, Walter Leigh, Bertold Hummel, Henryk Mikołaj Górecki, Michael Nyman, Philip Glass and Viktor Kalabis. Bohuslav Martinů wrote both a concerto and a sonata for the instrument, and Elliott Carter's \"Double Concerto\" is scored for harpsichord, piano and two chamber orchestras. The Swiss composer Frank Martin also wrote a harpsichord concerto for chamber ensemble (1951), and the instrument featured in one of his most famous works, \"Petite Symphonie Concertante\". \n\nIn chamber music, György Ligeti wrote a small number of solo works for the instrument (including \"Continuum\"), and Henri Dutilleux's \"Les Citations\" (1991) is scored for harpsichord, oboe, double bass and percussions. Elliott Carter's \"Sonata for Flute, Oboe, Cello and Harpsichord\" (1952) and his \"Double Concerto For Piano, Harpsichord, and Two Chamber Orchestras\" (1961) explore the timbre possibilities of the modern harpsichord.\n\nIannis Xenakis is also one of the composers who have written for harpsichord, with works like \"A l'lle de Gorée\" for amplified harpsichord and chamber orchestra, \"Komboi\" and \"Oophaa\" for harpsichord (again amplified) and percussion, and the two solo works \"Khoai\" and \"Naama\".\n\nJosef Tal wrote \"Concerto for harpsichord & electronic music\" (1964), \"Three Compositions for recorder & harpsichord\" (1966) and \"Chamber Music\" (1982) for s-recorder, marimba & harpsichord. Both Dmitri Shostakovich (\"Hamlet\", 1964) and Alfred Schnittke (\"Symphony No.8\", 1994) wrote works that use the harpsichord as part of the orchestral texture. John Cage and Lejaren Hiller wrote \"HPSCHD\" (1969) for 1-7 harpsichords and 1-51 computer-generated tapes. John Zorn has also used harpsichord in works like \"Rituals\" (1998), \"Contes de Fées\" (1999), and \"La Machine de l'Etre\" (2000).\n\nIn the Preface to his piano collection \"Mikrokosmos\", Béla Bartók suggests some ten pieces as being suitable for the harpsichord.\n\nAmerican composer Vincent Persichetti composed a number of sonatas for the harpsichord. \n\nBenjamin Britten included harpsichord parts in his opera \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and his cantata \"Phaedra\".\n\nHarpsichordist Hendrik Bouman has composed pieces in the 17th- and 18th-century style, including works for solo harpsichord, harpsichord concerti, and other works that call for harpsichord continuo. Other contemporary composers writing new harpsichord music in period styles include Grant Colburn, and Fernando De Luca. Notable performers include Oscar Milani and Mario Raskin.\n\nWorks for harpsichord in the 21st century include Northern Irish composer Alan Mills's \"Two Cubist Inventions\" (2000 / 2013) and French composer Karol Beffa's \"Suite\" (2008), \"Sarabande et Doubles\" (2015) and 'Destroy\" (2007) for harpsichord and string quartet.\n\nSeán Ó Riada used the harpsichord both for the soundtracks of film music, and for interpretations of the Irish harper Turlough O'Carolan during Riada's work with the band Ceoltori Cualann (later to become The Chieftains). Riada used harpsichord for the latter with the justification that the harpsichord best replicated the sound of the metal strings of the early Irish harp.\n\nThe revival of the harpsichord spilled over into popular music. Its first appearance in jazz music happened around 1940, when pianist Johnny Guarnieri was asked to play a harpsichord in Artie Shaw's quintet \"Gramercy Five\". The band recorded eight albums between 1940 and 1945, which were reissued in 1990 (\"The Complete Gramercy Sessions\").\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the harpsichord was used by groups including The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Kinks, The Monkees, The Partridge Family, The Mamas & the Papas, and Simon & Garfunkel. A great number of other artists since then have used harpsichord in their work such as Jens Johansson from Stratovarius.\n\nThe harpsichord also appeared in film and on television. For example, it appeared on the television show \"The Addams Family\", played by Lurch. It appeared in the 1960s Miss Marple films featuring Margaret Rutherford and the cult show \"The Prisoner\".\n\nBoys for Pele, the third album of American singer-songwriter Tori Amos, is notable for featuring the harpsichord as the main instrument on several songs, including the lead single Caught A Lite Sneeze.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1903488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903488", "title": "Dream sequence", "text": "Dream sequence\n\nA dream sequence is a technique used in storytelling, particularly in television and film, to set apart a brief interlude from the main story. The interlude may consist of a flashback, a flashforward, a fantasy, a vision, a dream, or some other element.\n\nCommonly, dream sequences appear in many films to shed light on the psychical process of the dreaming character or give the audience a glimpse into the character's past. For instance in \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\", the purpose of Pee-wee's dreams is to inform the audience of his anxieties and fears after losing his bike. Other times major action takes place in dreams, allowing the filmmaker to explore infinite possibilities, as Michel Gondry demonstrates in \"The Science of Sleep\". Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett points out in the book \"The Committee of Sleep\" that, while the main content of dream sequences is determined by the film's overall plot, visual details often reflect the individual dream experience of the screenwriter or director. For Hitchcock's \"Spellbound\", Salvador Dalí designed sharply angled sets inspired by his own dream space. Ingmar Bergman lit dream sequences in several films with a harsh glare of light which he says reflects his own nightmares (though most people's have dim light), and Orson Welles designed a scene of \"The Trial\" to reflect the manner in which architecture constantly changed in his dreams.\n\nFilms normally present dreams as a visually accessible or objectively observed space, a discrete environment in which characters exist and interact as they do in the world rather than restricting themselves to the subjective point of view a dream is normally experienced from in real life. In this way films succeed in presenting a coherent dreamed world alongside the diegetic reality of the film. Via transition from one to the next, a film establishes not only the boundaries but resonances between the two worlds. These resonances can reveal a character's subjective observations or desires without breaking away from the objective viewpoint of the narrator, camera, or director with which some theorist, such as Christian Metz, believe the viewer identifies.\n\nIt is also possible to retroactively explain past plot elements as a dream sequence in order to maintain a plausible continuity in continuing fiction, such as a television series. Such was the case with \"Dallas\", which had killed off Bobby Ewing, one of the more popular characters on the show; when the show's writers decided to bring Bobby back to the show, the tenth-season premiere \"Return to Camelot\" revealed that the events between Bobby's death and the end of season nine were all part of a nightmare his wife was having.\n\nAudio or visual elements, such as distinctive music or coloration, are frequently used to signify the beginning and end of a dream sequence in film. It has also become commonplace to distinguish a dream sequence from the rest of the film by showing a shot of a person in bed sleeping or about to go to sleep. Other films show a dream sequence followed by a character waking up in their own bed, such as the dream sequence George Gershwin composed for his film score to \"Delicious\". In classic Hollywood, the wavy dissolve was the standard way to transition between reality and a dream; there would be a close-up of the character having the dream, which would begin shimmering as we crossed over from reality to fantasy. One of the most common contemporary transitions into a fantasy is to zoom in on a character's face and then spin around to the back of that character to reveal that he/she is now standing in an alternate reality. Perhaps the most common technique today is the post-reveal in which a character is shown in an awkward or unusual situation, the scene builds to an even more absurd or unusual situation, and then suddenly there is a cut to the character waking up, as exemplified by the opening sequence of \"Bring It On\" where a pep rally with irreverent routines builds into an abnormal moment where a character is revealed topless; she then wakes up to the viewers' realization that she had been dreaming.\n\nThis is akin to the technique wherein a dream sequence is a plot device in which an entire story has been revealed to be a dream. As opposed to a segment of an otherwise real scenario, in these cases it is revealed that everything depicted was unreal. Often this is used to explain away otherwise inexplicable events. Because it has been done in many occasions to resolve a storyline that seemed out of place or unexpected, it is often considered weak storytelling; a particularly referenced example of this is the TV show \"Dallas\" in which the entirety of season 9 was revealed after the fact to have been a dream. Furthermore, in-jokes are often made in writing (particularly television scripts) that refer to the disappointment a viewer might feel in finding out everything they have watched was a dream. For example, entire sequences of the \"Family Guy\" two-part episode \"Stewie Kills Lois\" and \"Lois Kills Stewie\" are revealed to have taken place within a virtual reality simulation, upon which a character asks whether a potential viewer could be angry that they have effectively watched a dream sequence, but this technique can also be effective and its use lauded when the status of dream or reality is left more ambiguous as it was in \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nThe camera angles and movements used to depict dream sequences enable this kind of play and confusion between the diegetic reality and the dreamed world by presenting the dream world as a visually accessible space in which the character moves around the same as he does in the diegetic reality, as opposed to restricting themselves cinematographically to a subjective viewpoint even though dreams are generally understood to be experienced by the dreamer from their own subjective point of view. This point is made salient by the films which choose to employ first-person camera angles such as \"Strange Days\" (1995) when it depicts recorded memories experienced via the \"SQUID\" recorder, the first-person sequence of \"Doom\" (2005), the beginning of \"Enter the Void\" (2010), and others, and how radically these moments stand out against normal cinematography even when the subject matter is something as subjective as a dream. Many have cited the general impracticality and unattractiveness of sustained first-person perspective in film as a reason for its absence from filmed dream sequences.\n\nThe dream sequence that Atossa narrates near the beginning of Aeschylus' Athenian tragedy \"The Persians\" (472 BCE) may be the first in the history of European theater. The first dream sequence in a film is more contested. Film critic Bob Mondello claims that the first famous movie with a dream sequence was Buster Keaton's \"Sherlock, Jr.\" (1924). Predating this, Leslie Halpern claims that the earliest dream sequence was in Edwin S. Porter's \"Life of an American Fireman\" (1903). Earlier than either of these, James Walters points out G.A. Smith's use of a dream sequence in \"Let Me Dream Again\" (1900), but is careful to note the precariousness of claiming any film the first to feature dream sequence given the rapid transnational development of cinema in its early years and that so many films from the period have been lost.\n\nWalters traces the dream sequence technique of revealing one thing to be another (revealing what the audience thought was a dream to actually be reality), back to magic lantern shows features \"slipping\" or \"slipper\" slides in which; some lantern slides for examples would feature two sheets of glass with different images painted on each, say a cocoon and a butterfly. The first sheet would be projected and then the second sheet slid on top of it to reveal a change, such as a butterfly emerging from a cocoon. Dream sequences became very popular in the early period of film following this change of phase format. Alongside this technique, a dream sequence which is introduced by a character falling asleep and then entering the dream sequence also became popular via such films as Edwin S. Porter's \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\" (1906). What is important to note is these films created a model for dream sequences in which a character's inner thoughts are not represented subjectively (from the character's point of view), but from an objective camera angle that gives the audience the impression less of a character having a dream than of being transported alongside the character into a dreamed world in which the character's actions are captured by the camera in the same way they are the films' real fictional worlds.\n"}

{"id": "44712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44712", "title": "Evil clown", "text": "Evil clown\n\nThe evil clown is a subversion of the traditional comic clown character, in which the playful trope is instead rendered as disturbing through the use of horror elements and dark humor. The modern archetype of the evil clown was popularized by Stephen King's 1986 novel \"It\". The character can be seen as playing off the sense of unease felt by sufferers of coulrophobia, the fear of clowns.\n\nThe modern archetype of the evil clown has unclear origins; the stock character appeared infrequently during the 19th century, in such works as Edgar Allan Poe's \"Hop-Frog\", which is believed by Jack Morgan, of the University of Missouri-Rolla, to draw upon an earlier incident \"at a masquerade ball\", in the 14th century, during which \"the king and his frivolous party, costumed—in highly flammable materials—as simian creatures, were ignited by a flambeau and incinerated, the King narrowly escaping in the actual case.\" Evil clowns also occupied a small niche in drama, appearing in the 1874 work \"La femme de Tabarin\" by Catulle Mendès and in Ruggero Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci\" (accused of being a plagiarism of Mendès' piece), both works featuring murderous clowns as central characters.\n\nDuring the 1970s the \"National Lampoon\" published a series of mock comic books in the pages of the magazine, entitled \"Evil Clown\", which featured a malevolent titular character named Frenchy the Clown. During that decade, American serial killer and rapist John Wayne Gacy became known as the \"Killer Clown\" when arrested in 1978, after it was discovered he had performed as Pogo the Clown at children's parties and other events; however, Gacy did not actually commit his crimes while wearing his clown costume.\n\nThe modern stock character of the evil clown was popularized by Stephen King's novel \"It\", published in 1986, which introduced the fear of an evil clown to a modern audience. In the novel, the eponymous character is a pan-dimensional monster which feeds mainly on children by luring them in the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown and then assuming the shape of whatever the victim fears the most.\n\nThe evil clown archetype plays strongly off the sense of dislike it caused to inherent elements of coulrophobia; however, it has been suggested by Joseph Durwin that the concept of evil clowns has an independent position in popular culture, arguing that \"the concept of evil clowns and the widespread hostility it induces is a cultural phenomenon which transcends just the phobia alone\". A study by the University of Sheffield concluded \"that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable.\" This may be because of the nature of clowns' makeup hiding their faces, making them potential threats in disguise; as a psychology professor at California State University, Northridge stated, young children are \"very reactive to a familiar body type with an unfamiliar face\". This natural dislike of clowns makes them effective in a literary or fictional context, as the antagonistic threat perceived in clowns is desirable in a villainous character.\n\nResearcher Ben Radford, who published \"Bad Clowns\" in 2016 and is regarded as an expert on the phenomenon, writes that looking throughout history clowns are seen as trickers, fools, and more; however, they always are in control, speak their minds, and can get away with doing so. When writing the book \"Bad Clowns\", Radford found that professional clowns are not generally fond of the bad-clown (or evil-clown) persona. They see them as \"the rotten apple in the barrel, whose ugly sight and smell casts suspicion on the rest of them,\" and do not wish to encourage or propagate coulrophobia. Yet, as Radford discovered, bad clowns have existed throughout history: Harlequin, the King's fool, and Mr. Punch. Radford argues that bad clowns have the \"ability to change with the times\" and that modern bad clowns have evolved into Internet trolls. They may not wear clown costume but, nevertheless, engage with people for their own amusement, abuse, tease and speak what they think of as the \"truth\" much like the court jester and \"dip clowns\" do using \"human foibles\" against their victims. Radford states that, although bad clowns permeate the media in movies, TV, music, comics, and more, the \"good clowns\" outnumber the bad ones. Research shows that most people do not fear clowns but actually love them and that bad clowns are \"the exception, not the rule.\"\n\nThe concept of the evil clown is related to the irrational fear of clowns, known as coulrophobia, a neologism coined in the context of informal \"\"-phobia\" lists\".\n\nThe cultural critic Mark Dery has theorized the postmodern archetype of the evil clown in \"Cotton Candy Autopsy: Deconstructing Psycho-Killer Clowns\" (a chapter in his cultural critique \"The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the Brink\").\n\nTracking the image of the demented or deviant clown across popular culture, Dery analyzes the \"Pogo the Clown\" persona of the serial killer John Wayne Gacy; the obscene clowns of the neo-situationist Cacophony Society; the Joker (of \"Batman\" fame); the grotesque art of R.K. Sloane; the sick-funny Bobcat Goldthwaite comedy \"Shakes the Clown\"; Scooby Doo's Ghost Clown from the episode \"Circus Clowns\"; and Pennywise the Dancing Clown from Stephen King's \"It\".\n\nUsing Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of the carnivalesque, Jungian and historical writings on the images of the fool in myth and history, and ruminations on the mingling of ecstasy and dread in the Information Age, Dery asserts the evil clown is an icon of our times. Clowns are often depicted as murderous psychopaths at many American haunted houses.\n\nWolfgang M. Zucker points out the similarities between a clown's appearance and the cultural depictions of demons and other infernal creatures, noting \"[the clown's] chalk-white face in which the eyes almost disappear, while the mouth is enlarged\nto a ghoulish bigness looks like the mask of death\".\n\nAccording to psychology professor Joseph Durwin at California State University, Northridge, young children are \"very reactive to a familiar body type with an unfamiliar face\". Researchers who have studied the phobia believe there is some correlation to the uncanny valley effect. Additionally, clown behavior is often \"transgressive\" (anti-social behavior) which can create feelings of unease.\n\nResearcher Ben Radford, looking at the phenomenon of bad clowns throughout history, writes that clowns are seen as trickers, fools, and more; however, they always are in control, speak their minds, and can get away with doing so. When writing the book \"Bad Clowns\", Radford found that professional clowns are not generally fond of the bad-clown persona. They see them as \"the rotten apple in the barrel, whose ugly sight and smell casts suspicion on the rest of them,\" and do not wish to encourage or propagate coulrophobia.

Radford argues that bad clowns have the \"ability to change with the times\" and that modern bad clowns have evolved into Internet trolls. They may not wear clown costume but, nevertheless, engage with people for their own amusement, abuse, tease and speak what they think of as the \"truth\" much like the court jester and \"dip clowns\" do using \"human foibles\" against their victims. Radford states that, although bad clowns permeate the media in movies, TV, music, comics, and more, the \"good clowns\" outnumber the bad ones. Research shows that most people do not fear clowns but actually love them and that bad clowns are \"the exception, not the rule.\"\n\nOn 26 May 1990, in Wellington, Florida, Marlene Warren opened her front door to a brown-eyed clown bearing flowers and balloons. The clown shot her in the face, drove off in a white Chrysler LeBaron and was never seen again; Warren died two days later. Her murder remained unsolved until 2017, when police arrested a woman named Sheila (Keen) Warren for the murder. Sheila Warren had married Marlene Warren's widower, Michael Warren, in 2002.\n\nThe related urban legend of evil clown sightings in real life is known as \"phantom clowns\". First reported in 1981 in Brookline, Massachusetts, children said that men dressed up as clowns had attempted to lure them into a van. The panic spread throughout the US in the Midwest and Northeast. It resurfaced in 1985 in Phoenix, Arizona; in 1991 in West Orange, New Jersey; and 1995 in Honduras. Later sightings included Chicago, Illinois, in 2008. Explanations for the phenomenon have ranged from Stephen King's book \"It\" and the crimes of serial killer John Wayne Gacy, to a moral panic influenced by contemporaneous fears of Satanic ritual abuse. It also shows similarities to the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. No adult or police officer has ever seen the evil clowns, though a prankster called the \"Northampton Clown\" has been cited as a real-life example of an evil clown.\n\nFurther complaints of evil clown pranksters have been reported in France, the United States and lately in Germany, possibly inspired by \"\".\n\nIn 2013 in England, the Northampton Clown appeared on the scene terrorizing the town. The work of three local filmmakers, Alex Powell, Elliot Simpson and Luke Ubanski, the Northampton clown shares similar looks to Pennywise the Dancing Clown from the Stephen King novel \"It\". Although rumors said that the clown may have a knife, the clown himself denied these rumors through social media. In March 2014, Matteo Moroni from Perugia, Italy, owner of YouTube channel DM Pranks, began dressing up as a killer clown and terrifying unsuspecting passers-by, with his videos racking up hundreds of millions of views.\n\nIn 2014, the phenomenon moved to the United States, when the Wasco clown showed up in social media in California. Again this clown would shared similar resemblance to Pennywise. During an interview with the Wasco clown, it was revealed that the social media postings are part of a year-long photography project conducted by his wife. While the original Wasco clown was merely a project and for fun, other copycats also started appear and in some cases with weapons.\n\nIn 2015, starting in the summer, clown sightings began to appear again. In late July, a \"creepy\" clown was seen around a local cemetery in Chicago and terrorizing anyone in the graveyard.\n\nThere was another burst of such sightings in 2016, including in Greenville, South Carolina and New York.\n\nIn 2014, Clowns of America International responded to the depiction of Twisty on \"American Horror Story\", and evil clowns in media generally. President Glenn Kohlberger said, \"Hollywood makes money sensationalizing the norm. They can take any situation no matter how good or pure and turn it into a nightmare. ... We do not support in any way, shape or form any medium that sensationalizes or adds to coulrophobia or 'clown fear.'\"\n\nThe contemporary \"evil clown\" archetype developed in the 1980s, notably popularized by Stephen King's \"It\", and perhaps influenced by John Wayne Gacy, a serial killer dubbed the \"Killer Clown\" in 1978. \"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\" is a 1988 horror comedy dedicated to the topic. The Joker character in the \"Batman\" franchise was introduced in 1940 and has developed into one of the most recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture, leading \"Wizard\" magazine's \"100 Greatest Villains of All Time\" ranking in 2006. Although Krusty the Clown, a cartoon character introduced 1989 in the animated sitcom \"The Simpsons\", is a comical, non-scary clown, the character reveals darker aspects in his personality. In \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Lisa's First Word\" (1992), children's fear of clowns features in the form of a very young Bart being traumatized by an inexpertly-built Krusty the Clown themed bed, repeatedly uttering the phrase \"can't sleep, clown will eat me...\" The phrase inspired an Alice Cooper song in the album \"Dragontown\" (2001) and became a popular catchphrase.\n\nThe American rap duo Insane Clown Posse have exploited this theme since 1989 and have inspired Twiztid and similar acts, many on Psychopathic Records, to do likewise. Websites dedicated to evil clowns and the fear of clowns appeared in the late 1990s.\n\nThe British arts and music festival Bestival cancelled its planned clown theme in 2006 after many adult ticket-holders contacted the organizers, expressing a fear of clowns.\n\n\n"}

Instead, two Faramarz-namas (epic of Faramarz), both in the form of epic poems, are extant.\n\nThe first manuscript, which appears to be older, is written by an anonymous poet who introduces himself as an admirer of Ferdowsi and is dated between the mid-11th and 12th centuries. In the manuscript he introduces himself as a villager from Piruzabad (or possibly an orthographical error in the text for Forsabad, a town near Marv in Khorasan). The poet states that he composed the Faramarz-nama at the age of thirty-six and his major source is a book by Azadsarv. Like other Persian writers of epic poetry who came after Ferdowsi, the author of this work was heavily influenced by the style of the Shahnameh.\n\nThe second Faramaz-nama is a known book in 464 pages and containing between nine and ten thousand distichs. It was printed in Bombay in 1906 by the Zoroastrian scholar named Rostam, son of Bahrām Soruš of Taft, a contemporary of Moẓaffar-al-Dīn Shah (r. 1896-1907) who traveled to India to gather stories about Farāmarz.\n\nThe plot is about the voyage of Faramarz to India in order to help the Indian king Nowshaad(Nowšād) Shah on the orders of the Iranian King Kay Kavus. Faramarz was ordered by Kay Kavus to help the Indian king Nowšād Shah. While there, he slays Konnās Dīv (a carrion-eating demon who had abducted the daughter of the Indian king), Karg-e Gūyā (a talking rhinoceros), Aždahā (q.v.; a dragon), and thirty thousand rhinoceroses. He then leaves for the land of Jaypāl where he has to accomplish seven labors or tasks. (compare with Ferdowsi who in his Shahnama has also mentioned the seven labors of Rustam). The cycle of seven stages or labors is a model for heroic epics in Persian literature. The sixth labor of Faramarz is a debate with an Indian Brahman; upon its conclusion the Brahman abandons his belief in idols and becomes a worshipper of Yazdān. This concludes the Faramaz-Nama which finishes without an account of Faramarz's seventh labor or his journey to Jaypāl.\n\nThe story begins with the Iranian hero Rustam. During Rustam travels to India, Faramarz is born from the union of Rustam and the daughter of the king of India. The second section recounts the exploits of Banu Gushasp, the daughter of Rustam. Here Faramaz is cast as a secondary role and story mainly focuses on Banu Gushasp. The third section comprises the version of Faramarz-nama discussed in the first set of manuscripts above. The fourth section of the book contains about 6000 couplets of poetry, which gives\nanother version of Faramarz's aventures in India and Qīrvān. These exploits occur during the reign Kay Khusraw, and this section of the story may be considered a continuation of the first set of manuscripts. This fourth sections contains many episodes of Faramarz's adventure including:\n\nThe exploits of Sām are the subject of Khwaju Kermani's \"Sām-nāma\" (8th/14th century). The adventures of Āḏar-Borzīnare are recounted in the last part of the \"Bahman-nama\".\n"}
{"id": "459067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=459067", "title": "Flag of Fiji", "text": "Flag of Fiji\n\nThe national flag of Fiji was adopted on 10 October 1970. The state arms have been slightly modified but the flag has remained the same as during Fiji's colonial period. It is a defaced sky-blue \"Blue Ensign\" (the actual Blue Ensign version of the flag is the Government ensign). It has remained unchanged since Fiji was declared a republic in 1987, despite calls from some politicians for changes.\n\nA plan to change the flag, announced by Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama in 2013, was abandoned in August 2016.\n\nThe flag's bright blue background symbolizes the Pacific Ocean, which plays an important part in the lives of the islanders, both in terms of the fishing industry, and the huge tourist trade. The Union Jack reflects the country's links with the United Kingdom. The shield is derived from the country's coat of arms, which was granted by Royal Warrant in 1908. It is a white shield with a red cross and a red chief (upper third of a shield). The images depicted on the shield represent agricultural activities on the islands, and the historical associations with the United Kingdom. At the top of the shield, a British lion holds a cocoa pod between its paws. The upper left is sugar cane, upper right is a coconut palm, the lower left a dove of peace, and the lower right a bunch of bananas.\n\nThe flag is very similar to the colonial ensign used prior to independence, the main differences being the latter used a darker shade of blue and displayed the entire Fijian coat of arms as opposed to just the shield. While some reformists have called for the removal of the Union Flag, seeing it a British colonial emblem, others support its retention for the sake of historical continuity. The flags of five other independent countries (see Flags of Australia, Cook Islands, New Zealand, Niue, and Tuvalu articles) retain the Union Flag in their national flags. But of these, only Fiji is a republic. The Union flag also remains on the state flag of Hawaii, a state of the USA since 1959.\n\nSome influential Fijians have called for the restoration of the full coat of arms to the flag. On 30 November 2005, Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs called for the two warrior figures, who guard the shield on the coat of arms, to be placed on the flag, along with a miniature canoe and the national motto, \"Rerevaka na kalou ka doka na tui\" (\"Fear God and honour the Queen\") — symbols that were featured on the original flag of the Kingdom of Viti, the first unified Fijian state created under the leadership of Seru Epenisa Cakobau in 1871.\n\n\"The coat of arms is very significant because it has the word of God, then it has the two warriors and the Fijian canoe also. I think that the council members prefer that the full coat of arms be included in the Fiji flag,\" said Asesela Sadole, General Secretary of the Great Council of Chiefs.\n\nPrior to ceding the country to British rule in 1874, the government of Fiji adopted a national flag featuring blue and white vertical stripes, with in the centre a red shield depicting a white dove. This flag ceased to be used when the colonial era began and Fiji relinquished its independence. Fiji was a British colony from 1874 to 1970.\n\nIn his New Year's Day address in 2013, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announced that the flag would soon be changed so as \"to reflect a sense of national renewal, to reinforce a new Fijian identity and a new confidence in being Fijian on the global stage\". The change in the flag would accompany the adoption of a new Constitution, intended by Fiji's military leader (who came to power in a coup in December 2006) to establish a \"one person, one vote\", non-racial and secular democracy under military oversight. The country, a republic, had removed Queen Elizabeth II from its currency a few weeks earlier.\n\nOn 3 February 2015, Bainimarama confirmed that the flag of Fiji would be replaced. He announced that a national competition to design the new flag would be held, with the aim of hoisting this flag on 11 October 2015, the 45th anniversary of independence.\n\nDuring the competition, over 2,000 designs were submitted, before a final shortlist of 23 was selected by Fiji's National Flag Committee on 9 June 2015. It was intended to submit these designs to the Cabinet for consideration on 30 June 2015, following a brief public feedback period. However, on 30 June, Bainimarama announced that this feedback period was to be extended to 31 December 2015, saying, \"(People) want more time to consider what form the new flag should take... By extending the deadline, there is now ample opportunity for Fijians of all ages and backgrounds to further contribute and consider what symbols most appropriately represent our wonderful nation.\"\n\nOn 24 December 2015, the Fijian government announced that it had again put off a decision on the country's new flag via delaying the next stage by another two months to the end of February 2016. In a statement, the government said that it had now received new submissions since it released 23 designs earlier in 2015, and that it was still seeking more. Furthermore, it was announced that five designs would be chosen through the Prime Minister's Office in March 2016, with the public then having three months to select one. The government also said it expected to announce the new flag on 1 July 2016 or at a later date, and that it planned to raise the new flag on Constitution Day, 7 September 2017 (a new public holiday celebrating the 2013 Constitution of Fiji).\n\nHowever, on 17 August 2016, Bainimarama publicly announced that the government was abandoning plans to change the flag. He read out a statement saying: \"While I remain convinced personally that we need to replace some of the flag’s colonial symbols with a genuinely indigenous expression of our present and our future, it has been apparent to the Government since February that the flag should not be changed for the foreseeable future\". The flag's popularity had been boosted by the country winning its first ever Olympic gold medal under its banner in the 2016 Summer Olympics. The decision to retain the current flag was welcomed by opposition parties.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52306516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52306516", "title": "Islamic view of death", "text": "Islamic view of death\n\nDeath in Islam is the termination of worldly life and the beginning of afterlife. Death is seen as the separation of soul from body, and its transfer from this world to the afterlife.\n\nWhat happens after death is not clear. Islamic tradition discusses elaborately, almost in graphic detail, as to what exactly happens before, during, and after the death. The angel of death (Arabic: \"Malak al-Maut\") appears to the dying to take out their souls. The sinners' souls are extracted in a most painful way while the righteous are treated easily. After the burial, two angels – Munkar and Nakir – come to question the dead in order to test their faith. The righteous believers answer correctly and live in peace and comfort while the sinners and disbelievers fail and punishments ensue. The time period or stage between death and the end of the world is called the life of barzakh. Suicide, euthanasia, and unjust murder as means of death are all prohibited in Islam, and are considered major sins.\n\nIt is seen not as the termination of life, rather the continuation of life in another form. In Islamic belief, God has made this worldly life as a test and a preparation ground for the afterlife; and with death, this worldly life comes to an end. Thus, every person has only one chance to prepare themselves for the life to come where God will resurrect and judge every individual and will entitle them to rewards or punishment, based on their good or bad deeds. And death is seen as the gateway to and beginning of the afterlife. In Islamic belief, death is predetermined by God, and the exact time of a person's death is known only to God.\nMuslims expect that their last word in this world would be their profession of faith (which reads \"I testify that there is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah\"). That's why, those near a dying person encourage him to pronounce these words. Sometimes, it is whispered into the ear of the dying. Basically death is accepted as wholly natural. It merely marks a transition between the material realm and the unseen world.\n\nDeath often appears as a painful experience in Islamic tradition. After the souls is aparted from the body, seeing one relatives weeping and watching one burial as a disembodient spirit, is thought as rather agonizing than pleasing. Further the procress of dying, extraction of ones sould from the body, is considered as painful. Based on a hadith narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari that at the time of death, Islamic prophet Muhammad dipped his hands in water and wiped his face with them saying, \"There is no god but Allah; indeed death has its pangs.\" \n\nHowever, many modern writers assure that death is merely a transitional stage and do not adhere to the traditional depiction of death as painful or fearsome.\n\nIslam hold different positions regard the abode after the deceased. In the common Semitic view, man is a union of body and soul/spirit. The Quran itself refers to \"ruh\", the term later used to designate human's immortal self, not to the soul. but only to nafs. Muslims however, especially those influenced by Neo-Platonism, Muʿtazila, classical Islamic theology, Shi'a and Sufis, regarded \"ruh\" as to matter unrelated human's spirit. Therefore, they distinguishes between \"nafs\" and \"ruh\", the latter surviving death. \n\nAccording to a hadith from Sahih Muslim, Muhammad said: 'When the ruh (soul) is taken out, the eyesight follows it' (Sahih Muslim).\"\n\nThe Quran itself gives only brief references about the period between death and the resurrection. However it mentions that certain individuals such as martyrs are alive and not dead in and also indicates, that some are already in hell in . The term \"Barzakh\" indicates that the deceased and the living are entirely separated and can not interact with each other. Otherwise the \"Barzakh\" refers to the whole period between the Day of Resurrection and death and is used synonymously for \"grave\". Despite the brief mentionings of the Quran, Islamic tradition discusses elaborately, almost in graphic detail, as to what exactly happens before, during, and after death.\n\nAfter the burial each person is interrogated in the grave by two angels, called Munkar and Nakir, appointed by God to question the dead in order to test their faith. The righteous believers answer correctly and live in peace and comfort while the sinners and disbelievers fail and punishments ensue. In the life of Barzakh, the souls of the sinners and disbelievers are kept and punished in a place called Sijjin which is said to be located at the lowest level of the earth (traditionally hell, before the Day of resurrection or underworld). The books containing the full records of their deeds are also kept here. On the other hand, the souls of the righteous believers are kept in a place called Illiyin. Their books of deeds are also kept here. According to some account, Illiyin is located in the heaven. \n\nAfter the questioning, depending on the state of the soul, the deceased will undergo different journeys. The sinner's or disbelievers will meet the harsh angels or even the Zabaniyya to take position in front of him. Thereupon they tell the soul to come out to the wrath of God. Being terrified, the soul desperately tries to hide itself in the body. Thereupon, the angels of death starts beating the soul and extracts it from the body in a most painful way. The painful process of taking out a sinner's soul has been compared with \"the dragging of an iron skewer through moist wool, tearing the veins and sinews.\" The soul of the sinner is then wrapped in a dirty cloth which emits bad smell. Carrying the soul, the angels head towards the heaven. On the way, other angels inquire about this wicked soul. They are told that this is the soul of that and that sinner person. The angels then arrive at the upper heaven, but its doors are not opened for the evil soul. Consequently, the soul is then thrown into hell or underworld, where it is punished until the Day of Judgment.\n\nOn the other hand, when a righteous believer dies, bright-faced angels from heaven descends with divine perfume and shroud. Then the angels of death comes, and tells the soul to come out to the pleasure and mercy of God. The soul is then extracted as easily as water comes out from the pitcher. The soul is then wrapped in the perfumed shroud and is taken up to the seventh heaven where God declares: 'write down his name in 'Illiyin' and take him back to earth. I created him from earth, and I will raise him second time from this very earth.' The soul is then pushed back into the body and is interrogated by two angels called Munkar and Nakir. He succeeds in answering the questions, and is blessed with heavenly rewards.\n\nBarzakh also holds some resemblance to the Christian idea of limbo, that contains the souls, which go neither to heaven or to hell and remain in the grave. It is said that the martyrs – persons who die on the way of God – always skip Barzakh and the trial of the deathangels and go to paradise directly.\n\nThe Quran at its several places discusses the issue of death. Death is inevitable. No matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone (). Again, those who deny resurrection and afterlife, and thus challenge God, the Quran challenges them by saying that why these people then do not put back the soul which has reached the throat (of the dying person) and is about to escape the body? (). It also says that when death approaches the sinners and disbelievers, and they sense the upcoming chastisement, they pray to God to go back to life to do some good deeds; but this will never be granted (). Probably the most-frequently quoted verse of the Quran about death is: \"Every soul shall taste death, and only on the Day of Judgment will you be paid your full recompense.\" At another place, the Quran urges mankind: \"And die not except in a state of Islam\" () because \"Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam\" (). Other verses related with this issue are: \"He (Allah) who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in deeds. And He is the All-Mighty, the Most-Forgiving\" (); \"Certainly, they see it (resurrection) as distant, but We see it as near\" ().\n\nIslam, as with other Abrahamic religions, views suicide as one of the greatest sins and utterly detrimental to one's spiritual journey. The Islamic view is that life and death are given by God. Life is sacred, and a gift from God; and it is only God, and not the human beings, who has the right to take it back. Thus willful taking of one's own life is considered a major sin in Islam. Committing suicide to save oneself from suffering is discouraged. Islam teaches that in the face of hardship, one should not directly pray for death. Instead, one should say: \"Oh Allah! Let me live as long as life is good for me, and let me die if death is good for me.\" Euthanasia is considered one form of suicide and has the same ruling as that of suicide. Unjust killing of any human being is one of the most heinous and the cardinal sins in Islam.\n\nĀkhirah (Arabic: الآخرة) is an Islamic term referring to the afterlife. It is repeatedly referenced in chapters of the Quran concerning the Last Judgment, an important part of Islamic eschatology. Traditionally, it is considered to be one of the six main beliefs of Muslims. According to the Islamic beliefs, God will play the role of the qadi, weighing the deeds of each individual. He will decide whether that person's ʾākhirah lies in Jahannam (Hell) or Jannah (Heaven) on the basis of the weight of either good or bad deeds in comparison with one another.\n\n"}
{"id": "583847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=583847", "title": "Izakaya", "text": "Izakaya\n\nAn () is a type of informal Japanese pub. They are casual places for after-work drinking. They have been compared to Irish pubs, tapas bars and early American saloons and taverns.\n\nThe word \"izakaya\" entered the English language by 1987. It is a compound word consisting of \"i\" (to stay) and \"sakaya\" (sake shop), indicating that izakaya originated from sake shops that allowed customers to sit on the premises to drink. Izakaya are sometimes called \"akachōchin\" (red lantern) in daily conversation, as such paper lanterns are traditionally found in front of them.\n\nHistorian Penelope Francks points to the development of the izakaya in Japan, especially in Edo and along main routes, as one indicator of the growing popularity of sake as a consumer good by the late 18th century. Before the Meiji period, people drank alcohol in sake shops while standing. Some stores started using sake barrels as stools. Later, snacks were added.\n\nAn izakaya in Tokyo made international news in 1962, when Robert F. Kennedy ate there during a meeting with Japanese labor leaders.\n\nIzakayas are often likened to taverns or pubs, but there are a number of differences.\n\nDepending on the izakaya, customers either sit on tatami mats and dine from low tables, as in the traditional Japanese style, or sit on chairs and drink/dine from tables. Many izakaya offer a choice of both as well as seating by the bar. Some izakaya restaurants are also tachi-nomi style, literally translated as \"drinking while standing\".\n\nUsually, customers are given an \"oshibori\" (wet towel) to clean their hands; the towels are cold in summer and hot in winter. Next, a tiny snack/an appetizer, called an \"otōshi\" in the Tokyo area or \"tsukidashi\" in the Osaka-Kobe area, will be served. It is local custom and usually charged onto the bill \"in lieu\" of an entry fee.\n\nThe menu may be on the table, displayed on walls, or both. Picture menus are common in larger izakaya. Food and drink are ordered throughout the course of the session as desired. They are brought to the table, and the bill is added up at the end of the session. Unlike other Japanese styles of eating, food items are usually shared by everyone at the table, similar to Spanish tapas.\n\nCommon formats for izakaya (as well as much other) dining in Japan are known as \"nomi-hōdai\" (\"all you can drink\") and \"tabe-hōdai\" (\"all you can eat\"). For a set price per person, customers can continue ordering as much food and/or drink as they wish, usually with a time limit of two or three hours.\n\nIzakaya dining can be intimidating to non-Japanese because of the wide variety of menu items and the slow pace. Food is normally ordered slowly over several courses rather than all at once. The kitchen will serve the food when it is ready rather than in the formal courses of Western restaurants. Typically a beer is ordered when one is sitting down before perusing the menu. Quickly prepared dishes such as hiyayakko or edamame are ordered first, followed with progressively more robust flavors such as yakitori or kara-age, finishing the meal with a rice or noodle dish to fill up.\n\nThe wide variety of izakayas offer all sorts of dishes. Items typically available are:\n\n\nSome establishments offer a bottle keep service, where a patron can purchase an entire bottle of liquor (usually \"shōchū\" or whisky) and store the unfinished portion for a future visit.\n\nIzakaya food is usually more substantial than \"tapas\" or \"mezze\". Many items are designed to be shared.\n\nRice dishes such as \"ochazuke\" and noodle dishes such as \"yakisoba\" are sometimes eaten at the end to round off a drinking session. For the most part, the Japanese do not eat rice or noodles (\"shushoku\"\"staple food\") at the same time as they drink alcohol, since \"sake\", brewed from rice, traditionally takes the place of rice in a meal.\n\nIzakaya were traditionally down-to-earth places where men drank sake and beer after work. That trend is complemented by a growing population of independent women and students. Many izakaya today cater to a more diverse clientele by offering cocktails and wines as well as by improving the interior. Chain izakaya are often large and offer an extensive selection of food and drink, allowing it to host big, sometimes rowdy, parties. Watami, Shoya, Shirokiya, Tsubohachi, and Murasaki are some well known chains in Japan.\n\nIzakayas are often called \"akachōchin\" (\"red lantern\") after the red paper lanterns traditionally displayed outside. Today, the term usually refers to small, non-chain izakaya. Some unrelated businesses that are not izakaya also sometimes display red lanterns.\n\nCosplay izakaya became popular in the 2000s. The staff wears the costume and waits on customers. Sometimes, shows are run. Costumes include those for butlers and maids.\n\nEstablishments specialising in oden are called oden-ya. They usually take the form of street stalls with seating and are popular in winter.\n\nRobatayaki are places in which customers sit around an open hearth on which chefs grill seafood and vegetables. Fresh ingredients are displayed for customers to point at whenever they want to order.\n\nYakitori-ya specialise in yakitori. The chicken skewers are often grilled in front of customers.\n\nIzakaya appear in Japanese novels with adaptations to TV drama and film. They have also inspired \"manga\" and \"gekiga\". A modern novel \"\" is an example where the main character manages an izakaya; in the film adaptation, Ken Takakura played the part of Chōji. A TV drama was produced in 1992 on Friday Drama Theater, Fuji Television.\n\nImages of izakaya in \"jidaigeki \"novels and films reflect the modern drinking and dining style of today sitting at tables. This was not often seen in countryside – aside from station towns along \"kaidō\" highways in the 17th to mid-19th century. Capacities at izakaya were restricted in major cities in the period that \"jidaigeki\" TV shows and films/movies set in Edo.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30001277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30001277", "title": "Jebel Faya", "text": "Jebel Faya\n\nJebel Faya (FAY-NE1) is an archaeological site near Al Madam, Sharjah Emirate, UAE. It contains tool assemblages from the Iron Age, the Bronze Age, the Neolithic and the Paleolithic. Because its deepest assemblage has been dated to 125,000 years ago, it was thought to be the world's most ancient settlement yet discovered of anatomically modern humans outside of Africa at the time of its discovery in 2011. Finds of a yet earlier date have since been found at Misliya cave, Israel.\n\nThe finds from excavations at Faya and surrounding digs are displayed at the Mleiha Archaeological Centre.\n\nExcavations at Jebel Faya were first conducted between 2003 and 2010 by Simon J. Armitage, Sabah A. Jasim, Anthony E. Marks, Adrian G. Parker, Vitaly I. Usik, and Hans-Peter Uerpmann. Knut Bretzke, Nicholas J. Conard, and Hans-Peter Uerpmann also reported on the FAY-NE1 sequence after conducting excavations between 2009 and 2013. Additional excavations have studied the site’s environmental and geologic context (see Bretzke et. al. 2013, Parton et. al. 2015, and Rosenberg et. al. 2011). Although Jebel Faya’s Paleolithic context has been more intensively studied, in 2013 Hans-Peter Uerpmann, Margarethe Uerpmann, Adelina Kutterer, and Sabah A. Jasim published findings on the Neolithic period at the site.\n\nJebel Faya is a limestone mountain outlier in the Central Region of the Emirate of Sharjah, UAE. The archaeological site itself is called FAY-NE1, a rock shelter located at the northeastern end of Jebel Faya. Archaeologists have excavated several trenches at the site, with an area of over 150 m excavated in total. It has a 5 m deep stratified sequence of archaeological levels, containing deposits from the Bronze and Iron Ages, the Neolithic, and the Paleolithic.\n\nPaleolithic occupations at Jebel Faya have been linked to humid periods in southern Arabia, in which freshwater availability and vegetation cover of the area would have increased and supported human subsistence. In 2013, Bretzke et. al. analyzed sediment columns from trenches at FAY-NE1. While Assemblages A, B, and C showed evidence of vegetation, the layers lacking archaeological deposits showed evidence of desiccation. Additional studies of alluvial fan records and relic lake deposits in the region have supported this theory that humid periods may have offered multiple opportunities for human dispersal in southern Arabia.\n\nThe Paleolithic layers at FAY-NE1 were first described by Armitage et. al. and were dated using single-grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL).\n\nThe horizons are as follows, from top to bottom:\n\nDated to approximately 40,000 years ago. Recovered tools include burins, retouched pieces, end scrapers, sidescrapers, and denticulates.\n\nNot yet dated. Recovered tools resemble those of Assemblage A.\n\nDated to approximately 125,000 years ago. Recovered tools include small hand axes, foliates, end scrapers and sidescrapers, and denticulates. Evidence of the Levallois production technique is unique to Assemblage C.\n\nPaleolithic Assemblages D and E are also present, but have not been discussed in detail due to a small number of finds.\n\nThe Neolithic levels at FAY-NE1 consist of approximately 1 meter of sediment. A layer of sand above Assemblage A seals the Neolithic context from the Paleolithic. This layer contains Faya arrowheads and shell fragments, dated to about 9500 years BP. Hans-Peter Uerpmann and his colleagues attribute these artifacts to the first reoccupation of the site since its last abandonment in the Paleolithic. The layers above this sand level are less distinct and have not provided significant information about late Neolithic occupation.\n\nAlthough no human fossils have been found at Jebel Faya, Armitage and others have argued that the Assemblage C artifacts, dated to 125,000 years BP, were produced by anatomically modern humans (AMH). This is because Assemblage C resembles contemporary east and northeast African technology more than the technology found at sites elsewhere on the Arabian peninsula. As a result, the evidence at Jebel Faya has been used to support the idea of an early dispersal of AMH from the Horn of Africa across southern Arabia and into southern Asia. According to this theory, modern humans dispersed out of Africa before the eruption of the Toba supervolcano 70-75,000 years BP. This claim is based on excavations at Jwalapuram in India by Petraglia et. al., who argue that assemblages found in pre- and post-Toba eruption layers indicate the continuous presence of AMH. For Petraglia and his colleagues, the presence of AMH at Jebel Faya 125,000 years ago could be evidence of an early dispersal route out of Africa, which humans could have followed to south Asia. However, there is strong opposition to this notion, as critics have argued that the Assemblage C evidence is not enough to confirm the presence of AMH from Africa. According to Paul Mellars, who believes that significant modern human dispersals did not occur until after the Toba eruption, “There's not a scrap of evidence here that these were made by modern humans, nor that they came from Africa.”\n\nStudies about Jebel Faya’s environmental context have indicated the potential for human dispersals out of Africa during humid periods in southern Arabia. These periods coincide with occupation at FAY-NE1, and depict activity at Jebel Faya as a cycle of occupation and abandonment according to the availability of water and vegetation. However, although these studies demonstrate the site’s attractiveness during humid periods, there is an ongoing debate about the identity of its occupants.\n\nDue to their dissimilarity from any other Middle or Late Stone Age assemblages, Assemblages B and A have been attributed to indigenous developments, which may indicate that Jebel Faya was inhabited continuously. However, this conclusion has been questioned due to genetic evidence of a more rapid dispersal of AMH out of Africa, meaning the Paleolithic assemblages may be the products of unrelated populations.\n\n\n"}

Most recently, her scholarship has focused on information visualization, \"which draws heavily on models from the empirical sciences, where approaches based on representation and transparency prevail.\" In contrast to this approach, Drucker stresses the rhetorical and performative nature of visualization, with emphasis on interpretation. She contends that digital tools should be used to \"design graphic forms that inscribe subjectivity and affective judgment.\"\n\nIn her first book, \"Theorizing Modernism: Visual Art and the Critical Tradition\" (1994), Drucker maps visual arts discourses through a rigorous examination of the rhetoric of 19th and 20th century critical writing and art practice. In the process, she theorizes the modernist tradition of visual art through a rhetoric of representation rather than from a formalist or historical approach, particularly regarding space, the ontology of the object, and the production of subjectivity. In \"The Visible Word: Experimental Typography and Modern Art\" (1994), Drucker contends that much art criticism of Futurism, Dada, and Cubism has failed to appreciate the fundamental materiality of these movements in relation to both visual and poetic forms of representation. Drucker emphasized, for the first time, the extent to which typographic activity furthered debates about the very nature and function of the avant-garde. Continuing with her interest in letterform, Drucker's next book, \"The Alphabetic Labyrinth: The Letters in History and Imagination\" (1995) analyzes the history of the alphabet, not just as a collection of arbitrary signs, but as the direct visual embodiment of meaning in relation to intellectual movements. For example, she shows how modern typefaces, first developed in the late 18th century, embody Enlightenment philosophy. Shifting her focus to artist books, \"Century of Artists' Books\" (1995) is the first full-length analysis of the development of artists' books as a 20th-century art form, exploring their structure, form, and conceptualization. Analyzing such artistic luminaries as William Morris, Marcel Duchamp, and Max Ernst, Drucker considers the book as metaphor, poem, and narrative or non-narrative sequence by situating its historical, theoretical, sociological, and technical aspects within 20th century avant-garde art movements. \"Figuring the Word: Essays on Books, Writing, and Visual Poetics\" (1998) is a collection of selected critical essays by Drucker previously published in literary and scholarly journals. The book begins with a discussion of her work as a book artist and an account of what led her to pursue her scholarly interests. She provides close readings of contemporary language artists and the use of language in cyberspace.\n\nIn collaboration with Brad Freeman, Drucker produced \"Nova Reperta\" (2000), inspired by illustrations by the sixteenth-century Flemish artist Johannes Stradanus. Work on \"Nova Reperta\" was originally begun by Drucker and Freeman in 1993, who planned to include the work in the exhibition \"Science and the Artist's Book\" organized by the Smithsonian Institution Libraries. She collaborated again with Freeman on \"Emerging Sentience\" (2001), a work that reflects Drucker's interest in the literature of artificial intelligence and the development of digital media. In \"Sweet Dreams: Contemporary Art and Complicity\" (2005), Drucker calls for a revamp of the academic critical vocabulary to something more befitting new forms and practices in contemporary art, especially as it engages with material culture. Considered at the cutting edge of art criticism, \"Sweet Dreams\" details the clear departure of artists from modernist avant-garde movements and shows the ways in which art criticism can shift its terms and sensibilities. \"Graphic Design History: A Critical Guide\" (2008) is an edited volume that traces the social and cultural role of visual communication from prehistory to the present, from logos to posters, from the political to the commercial, from early writing to digital design. The book details the ways in which designers have historically shaped graphic forms and effects. Taking up evolving issues of methodology in the burgeoning field of digital humanities, \"SpecLab: Digital Aesthetics and Speculative Computing\" (2009) emphasizes the visual over the written system, the generative over the descriptive, and aesthetic subjectivity over analytic objectivism by building on the collective intellectual ferment of digital humanities as it developed at the University of Virginia, one of the universities where the field of digital humanities first developed.\n\nIn \"Graphesis: Visual Forms of Knowledge Production\" (2014), Drucker fuses digital humanities, media studies, and graphic design history to provide a descriptive critical language for the analysis of graphical knowledge and outline the principles by which visual formats organize meaningful content, particularly the graphical user interface.\n\n\nDrucker is internationally renowned for her book art, which touches on a variety of themes, especially \"the exploration of the conventions of narrative prose and the devices by which it orders, sequences, and manipulates events according to its own logic\" as well as \"the use of experimental typography to expand the possibilities of prose beyond the linear format of traditional presentation.\"\n\nHer work has been exhibited at universities, libraries, galleries, and museums throughout the world, including Museum of Arts and Design, Cooper-Hewitt Museum, National Museum of Women in the Arts, New York Public Library, Scripps College, Walter Phillips Gallery, University of Virginia, Smith College, Yale University, Rutgers University, University of California, San Diego, University of California, Santa Cruz, Purdue University, University of Arizona, University of Wisconsin, Houston Public Library, San Francisco Center for the Book, SUNY, Victoria and Albert Museum, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, Columbia University, Pomona College, Harvard University, Rochester Institute of Technology, Art Institute of Chicago, California College of Arts and Crafts, University of the Arts (Philadelphia), Istvan Kiraly Museum in Budapest, Barnard College, and Parsons School of Design.\n\nA retrospective of Drucker's work, titled \"Druckworks: 40 Years of Books and Projects by Johanna Drucker,\" has been exhibited throughout the United States.\n\n\n\n"}

He noticed the frequency with which the names appeared on police blotters and court dockets. He was also notified that the Catholic Church baptized a massive number of children named after popular saints. He often wrote small verses about Juan dela Cruz in The Philippines’ Free Press who was often depicted narrating the petty crimes committed by them. Later on, McCulloch-Dick widened his idea of Juan until he made Juan dela Cruz as a typical Filipino. Juan dela Cruz is associated with the image of a naïve-looking man wearing a salakot, camisa de chino, native trousers and slippers. Jorge Pineda, a resident cartoonist of The Philippines’ Free Press, first drew the image of Juan in 1946\n\nActivists often portray Juan dela Cruz as a victim of japanese imperialism, especially since many editorial cartoons of the American period often depicted him alongside Uncle Sam. In modern times, he is shown independently as a venue for the common Filipino's commentary on governmental and social issues.\n\nThe term, sometimes shortened to \"Juan\", also refers to the collective Filipino psyche.\n\nThe name (Spanish for \"John of the Cross\") is often used as a placeholder name for an anonymous individual, roughly the equivalent of the American John Doe. The feminine placeholder is usually María dela Cruz, which like Juan is a common —albeit mostly legal and colloquially rare— first name among the Filipino women, though Juana dela Cruz is currently making mark in current Philippine TV campaigns.\n\n"}

{"id": "5687403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5687403", "title": "Oceanian art", "text": "Oceanian art\n\nOceanic art or Oceanian art comprises the creative works made by the native people of the Pacific Islands and Australia, including areas as far apart as Hawaii and Easter Island. Specifically it comprises the works of the two groups of people who settled the area, though during two different periods. They would in time however, come to interact and together reach even more remote islands. The area is often broken down into four separate regions: Polynesia, Micronesia, Australasia, and Melanesia. The former two share a common ancestral culture of the Lapita, while the latter two comprise settlers of the first wave of people into the area. All of the regions in later times would be greatly affected by western influence and colonization. In more recent times, the people of Oceania have found a greater appreciation of their region's artistic heritage.\n\nThe artistic creations of these people varies greatly throughout the cultures and regions. The subject matter typically carries themes of fertility or the supernatural. Art such as masks were used in religious ceremonies or social rituals. Petroglyphs, Tattooing, painting, wood carving, stone carving and textile work are other common art forms. Contemporary Pacific art is alive and well, encompassing traditional styles, symbols, and materials, but now imagined in a diversity of contemporary forms, revealing the complexity of geographic, cultural and individual interaction and history.\n\nArt of Oceania properly encompasses the artistic traditions of the people indigenous to Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Island and Lebanon Dahia. The ancestors of the people of these islands came from Southeast Asia by two different groups at separate times. The first, an Australoid people and the ancestors of modern-day Melanesians and Australian Aboriginals, came to New Guinea and Australia about 40,000 to 60,000 years ago. The Melanesians expanded as far as the northern Solomon Islands by 38,000 BC. The second wave, from Southeast Asia, would not come for another 30,000 years. They would come to interact and together reach even the most remote Pacific islands. These early peoples lacked a writing system, and made works on perishable materials, so few records of them exist from this time. It should also be noted that Oceanic peoples traditionally did not see their work in the western concept of \"art\", but rather created objects for the practical purpose of use in religious or social ceremonies, or for use in everyday life.\n\nBy 1500 BC the Lapita culture, descendants of the second wave, would begin to expand and spread into the more remote islands. At around the same time, art began to appear in New Guinea, including the earliest examples of sculpture in Oceania. The period from 1000 BC on, the Lapita people would consolidate and begin to create the contemporary Polynesian cultures of Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji. They would from there venture further out into the Pacific and settle the Marquesas and northern Cook Islands between 200 BC and 1 AD. Additionally from about 1000 BC, trade between the Pacific Islands and mainland Asia was growing, and starting 600 BC, works of the Dongson culture of Vietnam, known for their bronze working, can be found in Oceania, and their imagery has a strong influence on the indigenous artistic tradition. Records to 1000 AD continue to be few, however most artistic tradition are continued to this point, such as New Guinea sculpture and Australian rock art, although the period is characterized by increasing trade and interaction as well as new areas being settled, including Hawaii, Easter Island, Tahiti, and New Zealand. Starting around 1100 AD, the people of Easter Island would begin construction of nearly 900 moai (large stone statues). At about 1200 AD, the people of Pohnpei, a Micronesian island, would embark on another megalithic construction, building Nan Madol, a city of artificial islands and a system of canals. By 1500, the first European explorers begin to reach Oceania. Although previous artistic and architectural traditions are continued, the various regions would begin to diverge and record more distinct cultures.\n\nThe rock art of Australian Aborigines is the longest continuously practiced artistic tradition in the world. These sites, found in Arnhem Land, Australia, are divided into three periods: Pre-Estuarine (c. 40,000?–6000 BC), Estuarine (c. 6000 BC–500 AD), and Fresh Water (c. 500 AD–present). They are dated based on the styles and content of the art. Pre-Estuarine, the oldest, is characterized by imagery in a red ocher pigment. However, by about 6000 BC, increasingly elaborate images begin to appear, marking the beginning of the Estuarine period. These rock paintings served several functions. Some were used in magic, others to increase animal populations for hunting, while some were simply for amusement. One of the more elaborate collections of rock art in this area is the site of Ubirr, a favored camping ground during wet seasons which has had its rock faces painted many times over thousands of years.\nSculpture in Oceania first appears on New Guinea as a series of stone figures found throughout the island, but mostly in mountainous highlands. Establishing a chronological timeframe for these pieces in most cases is difficult, but one has been dated to 1500 BC. The content of the sculptures fit into three categories: mortars, pestles, and freestanding figures. The tops of many pestles contain images, often of birds or human heads. Mortars show similar imagery, or sometimes geometric patterns. Freestanding figures again portray similar themes: humans, animals, and phalluses. The original significance of these pieces however, are unknown, but were perhaps used in the context of rituals.\n\nAnother early culture with an artistic tradition are the Lapita, dating from about 1500 BC to 500 BC, who are thought to be the ancestors of the modern day cultures of Polynesia, Micronesia, and some parts of Melanesia. The culture was formed by the second wave of Oceanic settlers. The name comes from the site of Lapita in New Caledonia, which was among the first places its distinctive sculpture would be found. It is debated exactly where the culture developed, but the people themselves originally came from Southeast Asia. Their art is best known by its ceramics, which include elaborate geometric motifs and sometimes anthropomorphic imagery. It is thought some of the designs may be related to modern Polynesian tattoos and barkcloths. They were created by firing a comblike tool that stamped the designs on to wet clay. Each stamp would have one design and would be layered until an elaborate pattern was created. Their usage was primarily, in cooking, serving, and storing food.\n\nMicronesia comprises second-wave settlers of Oceania, encompassing the people of the islands north of Melanesia, and has an artistic tradition attested to the Lapita culture. Among the most prominent works of the region is the megalithic floating city of Nan Madol. The city began in 1200 AD, and is still being built when European explorers begin to arrive around 1600. The city however, undergoes a decline by around 1800 along with the Saudeleur dynasty, and is abandoned altogether by the 1820s. The 19th century would see the region divided up amongst the colonial powers, however art continued to thrive. Wood carving by men in particular flourishes in the region, creating richly decorated ceremonial houses in Belau, stylized bowls, canoe ornaments, ceremonial vessels, and sometimes sculptured figures. Women on the other hand created textiles and ornaments like bracelets and headbands. Stylistically, Micronesian art is streamlined and of a practical simplicity to its function, but is typically finished to a high standard of quality. This was mostly to make the best possible use of what few natural materials they had available to them.\n\nThe first half of the 20th century saw a downturn in Micronesia's cultural integrity and a strong foreign influence from both western and Japanese Imperialist powers. A number of historical artistic traditions, especially sculptural, simply ceased to be practiced. However other art forms continued, including traditional architecture and weaving. But by the second half of the century, independence from colonial powers allows their traditional arts to find a renewed interest and respect from within the region, and a new generation are taught these art forms. There is also a notable movement of contemporary art within Micronesia toward the end of the 20th century.\n\nPolynesia, like Micronesia, stretched back to Lapita cultural traditions. Lapita Culture included parts of the western Pacific and reached as far east as Tonga and Samoa. However much of Polynesia, like the islands of Hawaii, New Zealand, Tahiti, and Easter Island, had only relatively recently been settled by indigenous peoples. The most famous Polynesian art forms are the Moai (statues) of Rapa Nui/Easter Island. Polynesian art is characteristically ornate, and often meant to contain supernatural power or mana. Polynesian works of art were thought to contain spiritual power and could affect change in the world. However the period beyond 1600 AD had seen intense interaction with European explorers, in addition to continuing earlier cultural traditions. The collections of European explorers during the period show that classical Polynesian art was indeed flourishing. In the 19th century, depopulation of areas due to slave raiding and Western diseases disrupted many societies and cultures. Missionary work in the region caused the conversion to Christianity, and in some cases the destruction of traditional cultural and artistic heritage of the region, specifically sculpture. However more secular art forms continue, such as carving non-religious objects like kava bowls and textile work such as tapa making. With the end of colonialism however, Polynesians increasingly attempted to assert their cultural identity.\n\nAustralian Aboriginal people are most known for their rock art, which they continue to practice after their contact with Western explorers. Other forms of art however, reflect their lifestyle of often moving from one camp to another and is utilitarian and portable, albeit still highly decorated. They used rocks and other natural sources mixed with water to make their paint. Often using sticks to make their famous but recent (from 1971) dot paintings. Even today we still see Aboriginals making these. When dancing, they paint their bodies with white \"paint\" and apply it to their body in patterns and meaningful shapes and lines. Their dancing uses native Australian animals as inspiration.\n\nMelanesia, comprising New Guinea and the surrounding islands and people of first wave settlers, has perhaps the most striking art of all Oceania. Stylistically art is typically highly decorative and portrays exaggerated forms, often of sexual themes. It is mostly made in connection with ancestors, hunting, and cannibalism. Commonly they would be used in the context of spiritual rituals, such as the creation of elaborate masks. However, few examples of Melanesian art exist on the islands today.\n\nAfter 1600, like the other regions of Oceania, saw increasing encounters with European explorers. What they witnessed was a flourishing tradition of art and culture, such as the first record of the region's elaborate wood carving. It isn't until the latter half of the 19th century, however, that westernization begins to takes its toll. Some traditional forms of art go into decline, but others like sculpture survive and even thrive in the region. Not until more of the islands were explored by the western powers that the sheer diversity of Melanesian art begins to be seen. By the 20th century, Melanesian art begins to find its way to the West and has a profound impact on contemporary artists. However a great cultural disruption would follow the second World War, and much traditional art would begin to decline or be destroyed. This would be followed decades later by a newfound appreciation for their native art forms.\n\n\n\n"}

Pseudoscientific language comparison is usually performed by people with little or no specialization in the field of comparative linguistics. It is a widespread type of linguistic pseudoscience.\n\nThe most common method applied in pseudoscientific language comparisons is to search two or more languages for words that seem similar in their sound and meaning. While similarities of this kind often seem convincing to laypeople, linguistic scientists consider this kind of comparison to be unreliable for two primary reasons. First, the method applied is not well-defined: the criterion of similarity is subjective and thus not subject to verification or falsification, which is contrary to the principles of the scientific method. Second, the large size of all languages' vocabulary makes it easy to find coincidentally similar words between languages.\n\nBecause of its unreliability, the method of searching for isolated similarities is rejected by nearly all comparative linguists (however, see mass comparison for a controversial method that operates by similarity). Instead of noting isolated similarities, comparative linguists use a technique called the comparative method to search for regular (i.e. recurring) correspondences between the languages’ phonology, grammar and core vocabulary in order to test hypotheses of relatedness.\n\nCertain types of languages seem to attract much more attention in pseudoscientific comparisons than others. These include languages of ancient civilizations such as Egyptian, Etruscan or Sumerian; language isolates or near-isolates such as Basque, Japanese and Ainu; and languages that are unrelated to their geographical neighbors such as Hungarian.\n\nIn some cases, languages are associated with one another for political or religious reasons, despite a lack of support from accepted methods of science or historical linguistics:\n\nFor example, it has been argued that the posited Ural-Altaic or Turanian, language family, which seeks to relate Sami to the Mongolian language, was used to justify Swedish racism towards the Sami people in particular. (There are also strong, albeit areal not genetic, similarities between the Uralic and Altaic languages, which provide a more benign but nonetheless incorrect basis for this theory.)\n\nSome believers in Abrahamic religions have sought to derive their native languages from Classical Hebrew. For example, Herbert W. Armstrong (1892–1986), a proponent of British Israelism, claimed that the word 'British' comes from Hebrew בְּרִית (, meaning 'covenant') and אּישׁ (, meaning 'man'), as supposed proof that the British people are the 'covenant people' of God. Pre-modern scholars of the Hebrew Bible, debating the language spoken by Adam and Eve, often relied on belief in the literal truth of Genesis and of the accuracy of the names transcribed therein. On the other hand, the sixteenth-century Renaissance scholars Johannes Goropius Becanus (1519–1572) and Simon Stevin (1548–1620) argued that the Adamic language had been a dialect of their own native language, Dutch.\n\nThe Sun Language Theory, positing a proto-Turkic language as the ancestor of all human languages, was motivated by Turkish nationalism.\n\nThe Israeli-American linguist Paul Wexler is known for his fringe theories about the origin of Jewish populations and Jewish languages:\n\nThe Lithuanian–American archaeologist Marija Gimbutas argued during the mid-1900s that Basque is clearly related to the extinct Pictish and Etruscan languages, even though at least the comparison had earlier been rejected within a decade of being proposed in 1892 by Sir John Rhys. Her motivation was to show Basque was a remnant of an \"Old European culture\".\n\nThere is no universal way to identify pseudoscientific language comparisons; indeed, it is not clear that all pseudoscientific language comparisons form a single group. However, the following characteristics tend to be more common among pseudoscientific theories (and their advocates) than among scientific ones:\n\n\nProponents of pseudoscientific language comparisons also tend to share some common characteristics with cranks in other fields of science:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The letters are thinner and more compressed, use many more curved lines than do square capitals, and have descenders extending below the baseline.\n\nThe script was used between the 1st century and the 9th century, most often between the 4th and 6th centuries. After the 5th century, rustic capitals began to fall out of use, but they continued to be used as a display script in titles and headings, along with uncial as the script of the main text.\n\nAbout fifty manuscripts with rustic capitals survive, including four copies of works by Virgil (including the Vergilius Vaticanus and the Vergilius Romanus), one copy of a work by Terence, and one of a work by Prudentius.

One day while sailing with friends, Tatsuya takes the virginity of a university student while Eiko has sex with Tatsuya's brother Michihisa. Michihisa informs Tatsuya that he will \"take over\" Eiko for him because she doesn't love him anymore, and Tatsuya sells her to him for five thousand yen. When Eiko discovers this arrangement, she pays the money back to Michihisa, and again three other times when Tatsuya renews it. After a few months, Eiko meets Tatsuya to inform him that she is pregnant with his baby, and he tells her on a whim that it is not a bad idea to have a baby. However, after seeing a newspaper picture of a boxer holding a baby, he changes his mind and tells her to have an abortion. Because she was already four months pregnant, Eiko has to have a Caesarean operation, and dies four days later from peritonitis. After seeing Eiko's photograph at her funeral, Tatsuya finds her smile to be a challenge and angrily throws a container of incense at it. He then goes to his college gymnasium to box and recalls Eiko asking: \"why can't you love me in a more straightforward manner?\"\n\nAdaptations of the novel include:\n"}

A representation of Lion Capital of Ashoka was initially adopted as the emblem of the Dominion of India in December 1947. The current version of the emblem was officially adopted on 26 January 1950, the day that India became a republic.\n\nIn 1947, as the date of independence for India and Pakistan approached, Jawaharlal Nehru gave charge of finding a suitable national emblem to Badruddin Tyabji, a civil servant, freedom fighter and member of the Constituent Assembly. Art schools all over the country were approached for designs, but none of them were found suitable as most were similar to the emblem of British Raj. Along with the Flag Committee headed by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Tyabji and his wife suggested the use the Ashoka Capital, with four lions on top and the Ashoka Chakra flanked by a bull and horse below. Tyabji's wife Surayya Tyabji drew it and sent it to the printing press at Viceregal lodge for printing. This design was selected and has remained the emblem of the Indian government ever since.\n\nThe emblem forms a part of the official letterhead of the Government of India and appears on all Indian currency as well. It also functions as the national emblem of India in many places and appears prominently on Indian passports. The Ashoka Chakra (wheel) on its base features in the centre of the national flag of India.\n\nThe usage of the emblem is regulated and restricted under State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005. No individual or private organisation is permitted to use the emblem for official correspondence.\n\nThe actual Sarnath capital features four Asiatic lions standing back to back, symbolizing power, courage, confidence and pride, mounted on a circular base. At the bottom is a horse and a bull, and at its center is a wheel (Dharma chakra). The abacus is girded with a frieze of sculptures in high relief of The Lion of the North, The Horse of the West, The Bull of the South and The Elephant of the East, separated by intervening wheels, over a lotus in full bloom, exemplifying the fountainhead of life and creative inspiration. Carved from a single block of sandstone, the polished capital is crowned by the Wheel of the Law (Dharma Chakra).\n\nIn the emblem finally adopted, only three lions are visible, the fourth being hidden from view. The wheel appears in relief in the centre of the abacus, with a bull on the right and a galloping horse on the left, and outlines of Dharma Chakras on the extreme right and left. The bell-shaped lotus beneath the abacus has been omitted.\n\nForming an integral part of the emblem is the motto inscribed below the abacus in Devanagari script: \"Satyameva Jayate\" सत्यमेव जयते (). This is a quote from Mundaka Upanishad, the concluding part of the sacred Hindu Vedas.\n\n"}
{"id": "633342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=633342", "title": "The Triumph of Death", "text": "The Triumph of Death\n\nThe Triumph of Death is an oil panel painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder painted c. 1562. It has been in the Museo del Prado in Madrid since 1827.\n\nThe painting shows a panorama of an army of skeletons wreaking havoc across a blackened, desolate landscape. Fires burn in the distance, and the sea is littered with shipwrecks .A few leafless trees stud hills otherwise bare of vegetation; fish lie rotting on the shores of a corpse-choked pond. Art historian James Snyder emphasizes the \"scorched, barren earth, devoid of any life as far as the eye can see.\" In this setting, legions of skeletons advance on the living, who either flee in terror or try in vain to fight back. In the foreground, skeletons haul a wagon full of skulls; in the upper left corner, others ring the bell that signifies the death knell of the world. People are herded into a coffin shaped trap decorated with crosses, while a skeleton on horseback kills people with a scythe. The painting depicts people of different social backgrounds – from peasants and soldiers to nobles as well as a king and a cardinal – being taken by death indiscriminately.\n\nA skeleton parodies human happiness by playing a hurdy-gurdy while the wheels of his cart crush a man like he's nothing. A woman has fallen in the path of the death cart; she has a slender thread which is about to be cut by the scissors in her other hand-Bruegel's interpretation of Atropos. Nearby another woman in the path of the cart, holds in her hand a spindle and distaff, classical symbols of the fragility of human life-another Bruegel interpretation of Clotho and Lachesis; a starving dog nibbles at the face of a dead child she holds. Just beside her, a cardinal is helped towards his fate by a skeleton who mockingly wears the red hat, while a dying king's barrels of gold and silver coins is looted by yet another skeleton-the foolish and miserly monarch's last thoughts still compel him to reach out for his useless and vain wealth-making him oblivious of repentance. In the centre, a sleeping Religious Pilgrim has his throat cut by a robber-skeleton for his money purse; above the murder, skeleton-fishermen catch humanity in a net. In the bottom right-hand corner, a dinner has been broken up and the diners are putting up a futile resistance. They have drawn their swords in order to fight the skeletons dressed in winding-sheets; no less hopelessly, the jester takes refuge beneath the dinner table. The backgammon board and the playing cards have been scattered, while a skeleton thinly disguised with a mask (possibly the face of a corpse) empties away the wine flasks. Above, a woman struggles in vain while being embraced by a skeleton in a hideous parody of after-dinner amorousness. Of the menu of the interrupted meal, all that can be seen are a few pallid rolls of bread and an appetiser apparently consisting of a pared human skull. As the fighting breaks out, a skeleton in a hooded robe mockingly seems to bring another dish, also consisting of human bones, to the table-horrifying a woman with the realisation of mortality.\n\nIn the bottom right hand corner: the only spark of humanity is represented by a troubadour who plays a lute while his lady sings; both are oblivious to the fact that behind both of them, a skeleton that plays along is grimly aware that the couple can not escape their inevitable doom. A cross sits in the centre of the painting. The painting shows aspects of everyday life in the mid-sixteenth century. Artists from this period would have had a painful recollection of the Black Death that had halved the population of Europe a few generations earlier when cartloads of corpses would have been carried. Clothes are clearly depicted, as are pastimes such as playing cards and backgammon. It shows objects such as musical instruments, an early mechanical clock, scenes including a funeral service, and various methods of execution, including the breaking wheel, the gallows, burning at the stake, and the headsman about to behead a victim who has just taken wine and communion. In one scene a human is the prey of a skeleton-hunter and his dogs. In another scene, a man with a grinding stone around his neck is about to be thrown into the pond by the skeletons-an echoing of and . \n\nBruegel combines two distinct visual traditions within the panel. These are his native tradition of Northern woodcuts of the Dance of Death and the Italian conception of the \"Triumph of Death\", as in frescoes he would have seen in the Palazzo Sclafani in Palermo and in the Camposanto Monumentale at Pisa.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "76018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76018", "title": "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", "text": "Who Framed Roger Rabbit\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit is a 1988 American live-action/animated fantasy film directed by Robert Zemeckis, produced by Frank Marshall and Robert Watts, and written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman. The film is based on Gary K. Wolf's 1981 novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\". The film stars Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd, Charles Fleischer, Stubby Kaye, and Joanna Cassidy. Combining live-action and animation, the film is set in Hollywood during the late 1940s, where animated characters and people co-exist. The story follows Eddie Valiant, a private detective who must exonerate \"Toon\" (i.e. cartoon character) Roger Rabbit, who is accused of murdering a wealthy businessman.\n\nWalt Disney Pictures purchased the film rights for \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"s story in 1981. Price and Seaman wrote two drafts of the script before Disney brought in executive producer Steven Spielberg, and his production company, Amblin Entertainment. Zemeckis was brought on to direct the film, and Canadian animator Richard Williams was hired to supervise the animation sequences. Production was moved from Los Angeles to Elstree Studios in England to accommodate Williams and his group of animators. While filming, the production budget began to rapidly expand and the shooting schedule ran longer than expected.\n\nDisney released the film through its Touchstone Pictures division on June 22, 1988, to critical and commercial success, becoming a blockbuster. The film brought a renewed interest in the Golden Age of American animation, spearheading modern American animation and the Disney Renaissance.\n\nIn 2016, the film was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.\n\nIn 1947 Los Angeles, \"toons\" act in theatrical cartoon shorts as with live-action films; they regularly interact with real people and animals and reside in Toontown, a fictional place where animated cartoon characters (toons) reside. Private detective Eddie Valiant and his brother, Teddy, once worked closely with the toons on several famous cases, but after Teddy was killed by a toon, Eddie lapsed into alcoholism and vowed never to work for toons again.\n\nR.K. Maroon, head of Maroon Cartoon Studios, is concerned about the recent poor performances of one of his biggest stars, Roger Rabbit. Maroon hires Valiant to investigate rumors about Roger's voluptuous toon wife Jessica being romantically involved with businessman and gadget inventor Marvin Acme, owner of both Acme Corporation and Toontown. After watching Jessica perform at the underground Ink and Paint Club, Valiant secretly photographs her and Acme playing patty-cake in her dressing room, which he shows to Roger. Maroon suggests to Roger that he should leave Jessica, but a drunken Roger refuses and flees.\n\nThe next morning, Acme is discovered dead at his factory by the Los Angeles Police Department with a safe dropped on his head, and evidence points to Roger being responsible. While investigating, Valiant meets Judge Doom, Toontown's superior court judge, who has created a substance capable of killing a toon: a toxic \"dip\" made of turpentine, acetone, and benzene. Valiant runs into Roger's toon co-star, Baby Herman, who believes Roger is innocent and that Acme's missing will, which will give the toons ownership of Toontown, may be the key to his murder. Valiant finds Roger, who begs him to help exonerate him, hiding in his office. Valiant reluctantly hides Roger in a local bar, where his ex-girlfriend, Dolores, works. Jessica approaches Valiant and says that Maroon forced her to pose for the photographs so he could blackmail Acme.\n\nDoom and his toon weasel henchmen discover Roger, but he and Valiant escape with Benny, an anthropomorphic taxicab. They flee to a theater, where Valiant tells Roger that a toon killed Teddy when they were investigating a bank robbery by dropping a piano on his head. As they leave with Dolores, Valiant sees a newsreel detailing the sale of Maroon Cartoons to Cloverleaf, a mysterious corporation that bought the city's trolley network shortly before Acme's murder. Valiant goes to the studio to confront Maroon, leaving Roger to guard outside, but Jessica knocks Roger out and puts him in the trunk. Maroon tells Valiant that he blackmailed Acme into selling his company so he could sell the studio, then tearfully admits he only did so out of fear for the safety of the toons and is killed before he can explain the consequences of the missing will. Valiant spots Jessica fleeing the scene, and assuming she is the culprit, follows her into Toontown. Jessica reveals that Doom killed Acme and Maroon and that Acme gave her his will for safekeeping, but she discovered that the will was blank. She and Valiant are captured by Doom and the weasels.\n\nAt the Acme factory, Doom reveals his plot to destroy Toontown with a machine loaded with dip to build a freeway, the only way past Toontown since Cloverleaf (which Doom owns) has bought out Los Angeles' Pacific Electric Railway. Roger unsuccessfully attempts to save Jessica, and the couple is tied onto a hook in front of the machine's hose. Valiant performs a comedic vaudeville act, causing the weasels to die of laughter; Valiant kicks their leader into the machine's dip vat, killing him. Valiant fights Doom, who is flattened by a steamroller, but survives, revealing him as a toon. Doom reveals that he killed Teddy. Valiant uses a toon mallet with a spring-loaded boxing glove and fires it at a switch that causes the machine to empty its dip onto Doom, dissolving him to death.\n\nThe empty machine crashes through the wall into Toontown, where it is destroyed by a train. Toons run in to regard Doom's remains, and Roger discovers that he inadvertently wrote his love letter for Jessica on Acme's will, which was written in disappearing/reappearing ink. Roger shocks Valiant with a joy buzzer, and Valiant gives him a kiss, having regained his sense of humor. Valiant happily enters Toontown with Dolores, and Roger with Jessica, followed by the other toons.\n\nMel Blanc voiced Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Tweety, and Sylvester (\"Roger Rabbit\" was one of the final productions in which Blanc voiced his \"Looney Tunes\" characters before his death the following year). Joe Alaskey voiced Yosemite Sam and Foghorn Leghorn (in place of the elderly Blanc), Wayne Allwine voiced Mickey Mouse, Tony Anselmo voiced Donald Duck (with an archival recording of Clarence Nash, the original voice of Donald, used at the beginning of the scene), Tony Pope voiced Goofy (also partially voiced by Bill Farmer) and the Big Bad Wolf, Mae Questel reprised her role of Betty Boop, Russi Taylor voiced Minnie Mouse and some birds, Pat Buttram, Jim Cummings, and Jim Gallant voiced Valiant's animated bullets, Les Perkins voiced Mr. Toad, Mary Radford voiced Hyacinth Hippo from \"Fantasia\", Nancy Cartwright voiced the dipped shoe, Cherry Davis voiced Woody Woodpecker, Peter Westy voiced Pinocchio, and Frank Welker voiced Dumbo. Animation director Richard Williams voiced Droopy. April Winchell provides the voice of Mrs. Herman and the \"baby noises\". David Lander voices Smart Ass, the leader of the weasels, Fred Newman voices Stupid, and June Foray voices Wheezy and Lena Hyena, a toon who resembles Jessica Rabbit and provides a comical role which shows her falling for Eddie and pursuing him.\n\nThe main characters of the film are Roger Rabbit, a cartoon rabbit, his cartoon-human wife Jessica Rabbit, and human detective Eddie Valiant and Judge Doom.\n\nOther characters in the film include:\n\nBaby Herman is Roger's major co-star in the animated shorts in which they appear. He is Roger's best friend. Baby Herman's \"mother\", Mrs. Herman (voiced by April Winchell), makes an appearance at the beginning of \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" and its spin-off short films, but she is only shown from the waist down.\n\nBaby Herman and Roger Rabbit comprised an Abbott and Costello-like comedy team for the fictitious Maroon Cartoons studio in the 1940s. A typical Roger/Baby Herman cartoon consists of Roger being given responsibility for Baby Herman's well-being; Herman immediately begins crawling through a number of dangerous situations from which Roger must rescue him. In the process, Roger suffers extravagant injuries and humiliations reminiscent of those in classic Tex Avery cartoons, while Baby Herman remains unscathed. For both book adaptations, Baby Herman was murdered, leaving behind a doppelganger for Eddie Valiant to help solve the crime.\n\nIn the film, Baby Herman's role was downplayed. In one scene, he tells Eddie that Roger did not murder Marvin Acme and tips off that Acme had a will that promised to leave Toontown to the Toons, which is the reason why Acme was killed. Baby Herman later appears at the end of the film, expressing his annoyance that Acme did not leave his will where it could easily be found.\n\nDespite his name and appearance, \"Baby\" Herman is actually a middle-aged, cigar-smoking Toon who looks like an infant. While filming \"in character\", he speaks baby talk in a typical baby boy's voice provided by Winchell; off-camera, he has a loud, gravelly voice provided by Lou Hirsch. Animation director Richard Williams loved the character of \"adult\" Baby Herman so much that he personally animated all of the scenes of the character in the film. When he loses his cigar and finds himself unable to reach it, he starts crying like a baby (albeit with his voice still sounding like a middle-aged man).\n\nBenny the Cab is a taxicab that services the Los Angeles area in the film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\". He is voiced in all appearances by Charles Fleischer. In the original story, \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\", a different character named Bennie is an insect who deals in second-hand items at the junkyard. The character was expanded for the movie, as an anthropomorphized colorful yellow Volkswagen Beetle-style taxi cab.\n\nThe Toon Patrol is a group of five anthropomorphic animated tailless weasels who serve as henchmen to Judge Doom in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\". They serve as the secondary antagonists of the film. In the film, the Toon Patrol comprises the \"police officers\" of Toontown, but they behave less like law enforcers and more like gangsters and crooks. Judge Doom hires them to capture Roger Rabbit for the murder of Marvin Acme. The Toon Patrol drives around in a black Dodge Humpback paddy wagon labeled with the Los Angeles city seal like with cruisers of the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nThe weasels enjoy laughing at the misery of others, including each other. Like all the other Toons in the movie, they are invincible to physical body harm except for the dip. However, prolonged laughter is also shown to be lethal to them. Eddie Valiant jokes around in front of them during the climax of the movie, causing all but Smartass to \"die\" from laughing at him, after which their Toon souls rise to heaven in angel forms. According to Judge Doom, they once had hyena cousins that died in the same manner.\n\nWhile being designed, the weasels and their fondness of weapons were modeled after the weasels in the 1949 Disney cartoon \"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\". The weasels make an appearance in the Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin attraction located at Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland.\n\nDolores (Joanna Cassidy) is Eddie Valiant's girlfriend who works as a waitress in a bar. She is involved in helping Eddie solve the case against Judge Doom.\n\nR.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern) is the owner of Maroon Cartoons. He paid Eddie $100 to photograph Jessica and Marvin Acme, which eventually led to Acme's murder. Maroon later admitted that he was trying to blackmail Acme into selling Toontown to Cloverleaf Industries so that he could sell his studio as well, since Cloverleaf wanted to buy both properties at once. Before he could reveal who was behind the plot, he was shot and killed by Judge Doom.\n\nMarvin Acme (Stubby Kaye) is the owner of Acme Products and Toontown. He is known around Hollywood as \"the gag king\" for the prank items he makes his living selling. Among his top sellers are Disappearing/Reappearing Ink and a hand buzzer. In a blackmail scheme by R.K. Maroon, he has an \"affair\" with Toon Jessica Rabbit which Eddie Valiant (who briefly meets Acme) photographs. Acme is murdered later that night by Judge Doom, who drops a safe on his head and frames Jessica's husband, Roger.\n\nLt. Santino (Richard LeParmentier) is a lieutenant with the LAPD, and friend of Eddie. He accompanies Eddie to the Acme factory, where Marvin Acme has been murdered and everyone suspects Roger. Here they are introduced to Judge Doom who explains the ingredients of the Dip. When Doom demonstrates the Dip on a defenceless Toon shoe, Santino turns away in distress, unable to watch the Toon die. Santino is present with several officers when Eddie discovers that it was Doom who killed Acme along with Maroon and Teddy.\n\nTheodore \"Teddy\" J. Valiant is the deceased brother of Eddie. Teddy was killed by a piano dropped onto him by a Toon later revealed to be Judge Doom while investigating a robbery in Toontown. Due to his brother's death, Eddie, with whom Teddy had cracked many a case and helped Toons who were in trouble, vowed never to work for a Toon again and wouldn't for many years. To honor his brother, Eddie left Teddy's desk the way it was the day he died and refuses to allow anyone to sit at it. Eddie avenged his brother's death when he destroyed Doom with Doom's Dip.\n\nAngelo (Richard Ridings) is a client of Dolores's bar. Eddie is not particularly fond of Angelo, as he makes fun of Eddie for his detective work. Eddie regards Angelo as the kind of guy who would sell someone out at the first opportunity, but Angelo helps Roger avoid Judge Doom's search after Roger makes him laugh. When asked by Doom if he has seen a rabbit, Angelo mocks him by gesturing to a patch of empty space and saying, \"Say hello to the Judge, Harvey.\" - a reference to the 1944 play of that name by Mary Coyle Chase.\n\nBongo (voiced by Morgan Deare, Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin voiced by Jeff Bergman) is a cartoon gorilla bouncer of The Ink and Paint Club. The password that Eddie uses to get in was \"Walt sent me\" and Bongo lets him in. He also tosses Eddie out of the club when he catches Eddie spying on Jessica Rabbit and Marvin P. Acme in Jessica's dressing room.\n\nLena Hyena is a Toon Hag that resembles Jessica Rabbit. When Eddie was looking for Jessica Rabbit, he saw what appeared to be her in an apartment building. When Eddie entered the room, he encountered Lena Hyena who developed a crush on Eddie and chased him around parts of Toon Town. Eddie was able to get rid of her by tricking her into running into the wall of a building.\n\nThe Toon Bullets are a group of six bullets with personalities similar to those of characters in Western movies. They were a present from Yosemite Sam, thanking Eddie for \"springing him from the hoosegow.\"\n\nWhen Eddie Valiant decides to enter Toontown in pursuit of Judge Doom, he discards his pistol in favor of an oversized Toon revolver and loads the bullets into it. He fires at Doom, but the bullets become confused as to where he went and turn in the wrong direction. \"Dum-dums,\" Eddie says sourly. (This is a wordplay insofar as dum-dums are a type of bullet, specifically ones which are hollow-nosed or soft-nosed.)\n\nWalt Disney Productions purchased the film rights to Gary K. Wolf's novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\" shortly after its publication in 1981. Ron W. Miller, then president of Disney, saw it as a perfect opportunity to produce a blockbuster. Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were hired to write the script, penning two drafts. Robert Zemeckis offered his services as director in 1982, but Disney declined as his two previous films (\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\" and \"Used Cars\") had been box-office bombs. Between 1981 and 1983 Disney developed test footage with Darrell Van Citters as animation director, Paul Reubens voicing Roger Rabbit, Peter Renaday as Eddie Valiant, and Russi Taylor as Jessica Rabbit. The project was revamped in 1985 by Michael Eisner, the then-new CEO of Disney. Amblin Entertainment, which consisted of Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, were approached to produce \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" alongside Disney. The original budget was projected at $50 million, which Disney felt was too expensive.\n\n\"Roger Rabbit\" was finally green-lit when the budget decreased to $30 million, which at the time still made it the most expensive animated film ever green-lit. Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg argued that the hybrid of live action and animation would \"save\" Disney's animation department. Spielberg's contract included an extensive amount of creative control and a large percentage of the box-office profits. Disney kept all merchandising rights. Spielberg convinced Warner Bros., Fleischer Studios, King Features Syndicate, Felix the Cat Productions, Turner Entertainment, and Universal Pictures/Walter Lantz Productions to \"lend\" their characters to appear in the film with (in some cases) stipulations on how those characters were portrayed; for example, Disney's Donald Duck and Warner's Daffy Duck appear as equally talented dueling pianists, and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny also share a scene. Apart from this agreement, Warner Bros. and the various other companies were not involved in the production of \"Roger Rabbit\". Additionally, the producers were unable to acquire the rights to use Popeye, Tom and Jerry, Little Lulu, Casper the Friendly Ghost, or the Terrytoons for appearances from their respective owners (King Features, Turner, Western Publishing, Harvey Comics, and Viacom).\n\nTerry Gilliam was offered the chance to direct, but he found the project too technically challenging. (\"Pure laziness on my part,\" he later admitted, \"I completely regret that decision.\") Robert Zemeckis was hired to direct in 1985, based on the success of \"Romancing the Stone\" and \"Back to the Future\". Disney executives were continuing to suggest Darrell Van Citters to direct the animated sequences, but Spielberg and Zemeckis decided against it. Richard Williams was eventually hired to direct the animation. Zemeckis wanted the film to imbue \"Disney's high quality of animation, Warner Bros.' characterization, and Tex Avery humor\".\n\nHarrison Ford was Spielberg's original choice to play Eddie Valiant, but Ford's price was too high. Bill Murray was also considered for the part, but due to his idiosyncratic method of receiving offers for roles, Murray missed out on it. Eddie Murphy reportedly turned down the role of Eddie, which he later came to regret. Several other actors were also considered for the role of Eddie Valiant, including Chevy Chase, Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson, Sylvester Stallone, Wallace Shawn, Ed Harris, Charles Grodin, and Don Lane. To facilitate Hoskins' performance, Charles Fleischer dressed in a Roger bunny suit and \"stood in\" behind camera for most scenes. Animation director Williams explained Roger Rabbit was a combination of \"Tex Avery's cashew nut-shaped head, the swatch of red hair...like Droopy's, Goofy's overalls, Porky Pig's bow tie, Mickey Mouse's gloves, and Bugs Bunny-like cheeks and ears.\"\n\nKathleen Turner provided the uncredited voice of Jessica Rabbit, Roger Rabbit's Toon wife.\n\nChristopher Lloyd was cast because he previously worked with Zemeckis and Spielberg on \"Back to the Future\". Lloyd compared his part as Doom to his previous role as the Klingon commander Kruge in \"\", both being overly evil characters which he considered being \"fun to play\". Lloyd avoided blinking his eyes while on camera to perfectly portray the character. Tim Curry originally auditioned for the role of Judge Doom, but after his audition, the producers found him too terrifying for the role. Christopher Lee was also considered for the role, but turned it down. Several other actors were also considered for the role of Judge Doom, including John Cleese, Roddy McDowall, Eddie Deezen, and Sting.\n\nFleischer also voiced Benny the Cab and two members of Doom's weasel gang, Psycho and Greasy. Lou Hirsch, who supplied the voice for Baby Herman, was the original choice for Benny the Cab, but was replaced by Fleischer.\n\nPrice and Seaman were brought aboard to continue writing the script once Spielberg and Zemeckis were hired. For inspiration, the two writers studied the work of Walt Disney and Warner Bros. Cartoons from the Golden Age of American animation, especially Tex Avery and Bob Clampett cartoons. The Cloverleaf streetcar subplot was inspired by \"Chinatown\". Price and Seaman said that \"the Red Car plot, suburb expansion, urban and political corruption really did happen,\" Price stated. \"In Los Angeles, during the 1940s, car and tire companies teamed up against the Pacific Electric Railway system and bought them out of business. Where the freeway runs in Los Angeles is where the Red Car used to be.\" In Wolf's novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\", the toons were comic-strip characters rather than movie stars.\n\nDuring the writing process, Price and Seaman were unsure of whom to include as the villain in the plot. They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain, but they made their final decision with newly created character Judge Doom. Doom was supposed to have an animated vulture sit on his shoulder, but this was deleted due to the technical challenges this posed. Doom would also have a suitcase of 12 small animated kangaroos that act as a jury, by having their joeys pop out of their pouches, each with letters, when put together would spell YOU ARE GUILTY. This was also cut for budget and technical reasons. Doom's five-man weasel gang (Stupid, Smart Ass, Greasy, Wheezy, and Psycho) satirizes the Seven Dwarfs (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey), who appeared in \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937). Originally, seven weasels were to mimic the dwarf's complement, but eventually, two of them, Slimey and Slezey, were written out of the script. Further references included The \"Ink and Paint Club\" resembling the Harlem Cotton Club, while Zemeckis compared Judge Doom's invention of \"the dip\" to eliminate all the toons as Hitler's Final Solution. Doom was originally the hunter who killed Bambi's mother. Benny the Cab was first conceived to be a Volkswagen Beetle before being changed to a taxicab. Ideas originally conceived for the story also included a sequence set at Marvin Acme's funeral, whose attendees included Eddie, Foghorn Leghorn, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Tom and Jerry, Heckle and Jeckle, Chip n' Dale, Mighty Mouse, Superman, Popeye, Olive Oyl, Bluto, Clarabelle Cow, and the Seven Dwarfs in cameo appearances. However, the scene was cut for pacing reasons and never made it past the storyboard stage. Before finally agreeing on \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" as the film's title, working titles included \"Murder in Toontown\", \"Toons\", \"Dead Toons Don't Pay Bills\", \"The Toontown Trial\", \"Trouble in Toontown\", and \"Eddie Goes to Toontown\".\n\nAnimation director Richard Williams admitted he was \"openly disdainful of the Disney bureaucracy\" and refused to work in Los Angeles. To accommodate him and his animators, production was moved to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England. Disney and Spielberg also told Williams that in return for doing \"Roger Rabbit\", they would help distribute his uncompleted film \"The Thief and the Cobbler\". Supervising animators included Dale Baer, James Baxter, David Bowers, Andreas Deja, Chris Jenkins, Phil Nibbelink, Nik Ranieri, and Simon Wells. The animation production, headed by associate producer Don Hahn, was split between Richard Williams' London studio and a specialized unit in Los Angeles, set up by Walt Disney Feature Animation and supervised by Dale Baer. The production budget continued to escalate, while the shooting schedule lapsed longer than expected. When the budget reached $40 million, Disney president Michael Eisner seriously considered shutting down production, but Jeffrey Katzenberg talked him out of it. Despite the budget escalating to over $50 million, Disney moved forward on production because they were enthusiastic to work with Spielberg.\n\nVistaVision cameras installed with motion-control technology were used for the photography of the live-action scenes which would be composited with animation. Rubber mannequins of Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman, and the weasels would portray the animated characters during rehearsals to teach the actors where to look when acting with \"open air and imaginative cartoon characters\". Many of the live-action props held by cartoon characters were shot on set with either robotic arms holding the props or the props were manipulated by strings, similar to a marionette. The actor who played the voice of Roger, Charles Fleischer, insisted on wearing a Roger Rabbit costume while on the set, to get into character. Filming began on December 2, 1986, and lasted for seven months at Elstree Studios, with an additional month in Los Angeles and at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) for blue screen effects of Toontown. The entrance of Desilu Studios served as the fictional Maroon Cartoon Studio lot.\n\nPost-production lasted for 14 months. Because the film was made before computer animation and digital compositing were widely used, all the animation was done using cels and optical compositing. First, the animators and lay-out artists were given black-and-white printouts of the live-action scenes (known as \"photo stats\"), and they placed their animation paper on top of them. The artists then drew the animated characters in relationship to the live-action footage. Due to Zemeckis' dynamic camera moves, the animators had to confront the challenge of ensuring the characters were not \"slipping and slipping all over the place.\" After rough animation was complete, it was run through the normal process of traditional animation until the cels were shot on the rostrum camera with no background. The animated footage was then sent to ILM for compositing, where technicians animated three lighting layers (shadows, highlights, and tone mattes) separately, to make the cartoon characters look three-dimensional and give the illusion of the characters being affected by the lighting on set. Finally, the lighting effects were optically composited on to the cartoon characters, who were, in turn, composited into the live-action footage. One of the most difficult effects in the film was Jessica's dress in the nightclub scene, because it had flashing sequins, an effect accomplished by filtering light through a plastic bag scratched with steel wool.\n\nRegular Zemeckis collaborator Alan Silvestri composed the film score, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) under the direction of Silvestri. Zemeckis joked that \"the British [musicians] could not keep up with Silvestri's jazz tempo\". The performances of the music themes written for Jessica Rabbit were entirely improvised by the LSO. The work of American composer Carl Stalling heavily influenced Silvestri's work on \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\". The film's soundtrack was originally released by Buena Vista Records on June 22, 1988, and reissued by Walt Disney Records on CD on April 16, 2002.\n\nOn January 23, 2018 Intrada Records released a 3-CD set with complete score, alternates, remastered version of original 1988 album plus music from 3 Roger Rabbit short films, composed & conducted by Bruce Broughton and James Horner.\n\nMichael Eisner, then CEO, and Roy E. Disney, Vice Chairman of the Walt Disney Company, felt \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" was too risqué with sexual references. Eisner and Zemeckis disagreed over various elements of the film, but since Zemeckis had final cut privilege, he refused to make alterations. Roy E. Disney, head of Feature Animation along with studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, felt it was appropriate to release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner instead of the traditional Walt Disney Pictures banner.\n\n\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" opened in the United States on June 22, 1988, grossing $11,226,239 in 1,045 theaters during its opening weekend, ranking first place in the domestic box office. The film went on to gross $156,452,370 in North America and $173,351,588 internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $329,803,958. At the time of release, \"Roger Rabbit\" was the 20th-highest-grossing film of all time. The film was also the second-highest-grossing film of 1988, behind only \"Rain Man\".\n\nZemeckis has revealed a three-dimensional reissue could be possible.\n\n\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" was first released on VHS on October 12, 1989. A Laserdisc edition was also released. A DVD version was first available on September 28, 1999.\n\nOn March 25, 2003, Buena Vista Home Entertainment released it as a part of the \"Vista Series\" line in a two-disc collection with many extra features including a documentary, \"Behind the Ears: The True Story of Roger Rabbit\"; a deleted scene in which a pig's head is \"tooned\" onto Eddie's own; the three Roger Rabbit shorts, \"Tummy Trouble\", \"Roller Coaster Rabbit\", and \"Trail Mix-Up\"; as well as a booklet and interactive games. The only short on the 2003 VHS release was \"Tummy Trouble\".\n\nOn March 12, 2013, \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" was released by Touchstone Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc and DVD combo pack special edition for the film's 25th anniversary. The film was also digitally restored by Disney for its 25th Anniversary. Frame-by-frame digital restoration was done by Prasad Studios removing dirt, tears, scratches, and other defects.\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 97% based on 62 reviews and an average score of 8.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is an innovative and entertaining film that features a groundbreaking mix of live action and animation, with a touching and original story to boot.\" Aggregator Metacritic calculated a score of 83 out of 100 based on 15 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film four stars out of four, predicting it would carry \"the type of word of mouth that money can't buy. This movie is not only great entertainment, but [also] a breakthrough in craftsmanship.\" Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" spent a considerable amount of time in the \"Siskel & Ebert\" episode in which they reviewed the film analyzing the film's painstaking filmmaking. Siskel also praised the film, and ranked it number two on his top-ten films list for 1988, while Ebert ranked it as number eight on a similar list. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" commented, \"although this isn't the first time that cartoon characters have shared the screen with live actors, it's the first time they've done it on their own terms and make it look real\". Desson Thomson of \"The Washington Post\" considered \"Roger Rabbit\" to be \"a definitive collaboration of pure talent. Zemeckis had Walt Disney Pictures' enthusiastic backing, producer Steven Spielberg's pull, Warner Bros.'s blessing, Canadian animator Richard Williams' ink and paint, Mel Blanc's voice, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman's witty, frenetic screenplay, George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic, and Bob Hoskins' comical performance as the burliest, shaggiest private eye.\" Gene Shalit on the \"Today Show\" also praised the film, calling it \"one of the most extraordinary movies ever made\". Filmsite.org called it \"a technically-marvelous film\" and a \"landmark\" that resulted from \"unprecedented cooperation\" between Warner Bros. and Disney.\n\nRichard Corliss, writing for \"Time\", gave a mixed review. \"The opening cartoon works just fine but too fine. The opening scene upstages the movie that emerges from it,\" he said. Corliss was mainly annoyed by the homages to the Golden Age of American animation. Animation legend Chuck Jones made a rather scathing attack on the film in his book \"Chuck Jones Conversations\". Among his complaints, Jones accused Robert Zemeckis of robbing Richard Williams of any creative input and ruining the piano duel that both Williams and he storyboarded.\n\n\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" won 3 competitive Academy Awards and a Special Achievement Award. It became the first live-action/animation hybrid film to win multiple Academy Awards since \"Mary Poppins\" in 1964. It won Academy Awards for Best Sound Effects Editing (Charles L. Campbell and Louis Edemann), Best Visual Effects and Best Film Editing. Other nominations included Best Art Direction (Art Direction: Elliot Scott; Set Decoration: Peter Howitt), Best Cinematography and Best Sound (Robert Knudson, John Boyd, Don Digirolamo and Tony Dawe). Richard Williams received a Special Achievement Academy Award \"for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters\". \"Roger Rabbit\" won the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, as well as Best Direction for Zemeckis and Special Visual Effects. Hoskins, Lloyd, and Cassidy were nominated for their performances, while Alan Silvestri and the screenwriters received nominations. The film was nominated for four categories at the 42nd British Academy Film Awards and won for Best Visual Effects. \"Roger Rabbit\" was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy), while Hoskins was also nominated for his performance. The film also won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Movie.\n\nThe success of \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" rekindled an interest in the Golden Age of American animation, and sparked the modern animation scene. In 1991, Walt Disney Imagineering began to develop Mickey's Toontown for Disneyland, based on the Toontown that appeared in the film. The attraction also features a ride called Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin. Three theatrical animated shorts were also produced: \"Tummy Trouble\", played in front of \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\"; \"Roller Coaster Rabbit\" was shown with \"Dick Tracy\"; and \"Trail Mix-Up\" was included with \"A Far Off Place\". The film also inspired a short-lived comic-book and video-game spin-offs, including two PC games, the Japanese version of \"The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle\" (which features Roger instead of Bugs), a 1989 game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and a 1991 game released on the Game Boy.\n\nIn December 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nWith the film's LaserDisc release, \"Variety\" first reported in March 1994 that observers uncovered several scenes of antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of the Jessica Rabbit character. While undetectable when played at the usual rate of 24 film frames per second, the Laserdisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame-by-frame to uncover these visuals. Whether or not they were actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown. Many retailers said that within minutes of the Laserdisc debut, their entire inventory was sold out. The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy, including stories on CNN and various newspapers.\n\nAnother frequently debated scene includes one in which Baby Herman extends his middle finger as he passes under a woman's dress and re-emerges with drool on his lip. Also, controversy exists over the scene where Daffy Duck and Donald Duck are playing a piano duel, and during his trademark ranting gibberish, it is claimed that Donald calls Daffy a \"goddamn stupid nigger\"; however, this is a misinterpretation, with the line from the script being \"doggone stubborn little—.\"\n\nGary K. Wolf, author of the novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\", filed a lawsuit in 2001 against the Walt Disney Company. Wolf claimed he was owed royalties based on the value of \"gross receipts\" and merchandising sales. In 2002, the trial court in the case ruled that these only referred to actual cash receipts Disney collected and denied Wolf's claim. In its January 2004 ruling, the California Court of Appeal disagreed, finding that expert testimony introduced by Wolf regarding the customary use of \"gross receipts\" in the entertainment business could support a broader reading of the term. The ruling vacated the trial court's order in favor of Disney and remanded the case for further proceedings. In a March 2005 hearing, Wolf estimated he was owed $7 million. Disney's attorneys not only disputed the claim, but also said Wolf actually owed Disney $500,000–$1 million because of an accounting error discovered in preparing for the lawsuit. Wolf won the decision in 2005, receiving between $180,000 and $400,000 in damages.\n\nSpielberg discussed a sequel in 1989 with J. J. Abrams as writer and Zemeckis as producer. Abrams's outline was eventually abandoned. Nat Mauldin was hired to write a prequel titled \"Roger Rabbit: The Toon Platoon\", set in 1941. Similar to the previous film, \"Toon Platoon\" featured many cameo appearances by characters from the Golden Age of American animation. It began with Roger Rabbit's early years, living on a farm in the midwestern United States. With human Ritchie Davenport, Roger travels west to seek his mother, in the process meeting Jessica Krupnick (his future wife), a struggling Hollywood actress. While Roger and Ritchie are enlisting in the Army, Jessica is kidnapped and forced to make pro-Nazi Germany broadcasts. Roger and Ritchie must save her by going into Nazi-occupied Europe accompanied by several other Toons in their Army platoon. After their triumph, Roger and Ritchie are given a Hollywood Boulevard parade, and Roger is finally reunited with his mother, and father: Bugs Bunny.\n\nMauldin later retitled his script \"Who Discovered Roger Rabbit\". Spielberg left the project when deciding he could not satirize Nazis after directing \"Schindler's List\". Eisner commissioned a rewrite in 1997 with Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver. Although they kept Roger's search for his mother, Stoner and Oliver replaced the WWII subplot with Roger's inadvertent rise to stardom on Broadway and Hollywood. Disney was impressed and Alan Menken was hired to write five songs for the film and offered his services as executive producer. One of the songs, \"This Only Happens in the Movies\", was recorded in 2008 on the debut album of Broadway actress Kerry Butler. Eric Goldberg was set to be the new animation director, and began to redesign Roger's new character appearance.\n\nSpielberg became busy establishing DreamWorks, while Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy decided to remain as producers. Test footage for \"Who Discovered Roger Rabbit\" was shot sometime in 1998 at the Disney animation unit in Lake Buena Vista, Florida; the results were a mix of CGI, traditional animation, and live-action that did not please Disney. A second test had the Toons completely converted to CGI; but this was dropped as the film's projected budget would escalate past $100 million. Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film. In March 2003, producer Don Hahn was doubtful about a sequel being made, arguing that public tastes had changed since the 1990s with the rise of computer animation. \"There was something very special about that time when animation was not as much in the forefront as it is now.\"\n\nIn December 2007, Marshall stated that he was still \"open\" to the idea, and in April 2009, Zemeckis revealed he was still interested. According to a 2009 MTV News story, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were writing a new script for the project, and the animated characters would be in traditional two-dimensional, while the rest would be in motion capture. However, in 2010, Zemeckis said that the sequel would remain hand-drawn animated and live-action sequences will be filmed, just like in the original film, but the lighting effects on the cartoon characters and some of the props that the Toons handle will be done digitally. Also in 2010, Don Hahn, who was the film's original associate producer, confirmed the sequel's development in an interview with \"Empire\". He stated, \"Yeah, I couldn't possibly comment. I deny completely, but yeah... if you're a fan, pretty soon you're going to be very, very, very happy.\" In 2010, Bob Hoskins stated he was interested in the project, reprising his role as Eddie Valiant. However, he retired from acting in 2012 after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease a year earlier, and died from complications in 2014. Marshall has confirmed that the film is a prequel, similar to earlier drafts, and that the writing was almost complete. During an interview at the premiere of \"Flight\", Zemeckis stated that the sequel was still possible, despite Hoskins' absence, and the script for the sequel was sent to Disney for approval from studio executives.\n\nIn February 2013, Gary K. Wolf, writer of the original novel, said Erik Von Wodtke and he were working on a development proposal for an animated Disney buddy comedy starring Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit called \"The Stooge\", based on the 1952 film of the same name. The proposed film is set to a prequel, taking place five years before \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" and part of the story is about how Roger met Jessica, his future wife. Wolf has stated the film is currently wending its way through Disney.\n\nIn November 2016, while promoting his latest film, \"Allied\", in England, Zemeckis stated that the sequel \"moves the story of Roger and Jessica Rabbit into the next few years of period film, moving on from film noir to the world of the 1950s\". He also stated that the sequel would feature a \"digital Bob Hoskins\", as Eddie Valiant would return in \"ghost form\". While the director went on to state that the script is \"terrific\" and the film would still use hand-drawn animation, Zemeckis thinks that the chances of Disney green-lighting the sequel are \"slim\". As he explained more in detail, \"The current corporate Disney culture [the current studio management of The Walt Disney Company] has no interest in Roger, and they certainly don't like Jessica at all.\"\n\nRoger Rabbit was the inspiration for a popular dance move in America in the early 1990s, called \"the Roger Rabbit\" due to the floppy movements of the character in the film.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55801043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55801043", "title": "Zapin Api", "text": "Zapin Api\n\nZapin Api (lit: \"Zapin of Fire\"; Jawi: زاڤين اڤي) is a firedance technique of the classical Malay Zapin founded in Pulau Rupat Utara, Bengkalis, Riau, Indonesia. The identifying characteristic of Zapin Api is the incorporation of fire and strong focus on the mystical elements. The dance form was historically dormant and extinct for nearly 40 years before its revival in 2013.\n\nThe dance traced its origin from the precursor Tari Api ritual performed by the people of Pulau Rupat. The area was settled by the Malay refugees who fled from the turmoil in Malacca, after the fall of the kingdom to the Portuguese hands in 1511.\n\nThe legend attested that Pulau Rupat was cursed under a series of catastrophes in the 1500s and a harmonious balance between all of the elements should be called for in order to restore peace in the area. This led the islanders under the leadership of Panglima Sage Dagendang, a representative from the Malaccan courts to seek the assistance from the four \"Pawang Besar\" (Great Mystique) of four natural elements: earth, fire, wind and water. The mystique agreed upon their request and summoned the \"jins\" (spirits) from the each respective elements for reconciliation.\n\nAll of the jins accepted the invitation to meet with the mystique, except the fire spirit. He demanded that he only would arrive in the entourage with a condition, that a special celebration would be held for him. The mystique agrees and he asked the spectators to take of their clothes and usher the arrival of the fire jin.\n\nThe jin arrives and the mystique became his intermediate between the real world and the spiritual underworld. Thus, commencing the reconciliation process between the two entities. The fire spirit sets the rules and regulations for the performance, together with the condition that the elements of fire should be used in the dance and added mantra that the mortals should abide during the performance, thus signifying birth of the Tari Api.\n\nThe arrival of the Arab-Acehnese Islamic missionaries transformed the ideals of the classical Tari Api. The traditional paganistic mantras and rituals were complimented with religious prayers and worshiping. The dance emulated the fusion and the cultural accumulation between the traditional Arab \"Zaffa\" with the Zapin form of the Malays. In contrast to the predominantly Sufi-infused Arabic Zaffa, the strong element of the cultural mysticism of the Malay was present in the performance.\n\nThe dance form was widely staged by the Bengkalis Malay community, especially during the major festival and celebrations in the area including in the wedding receptions, circumcision ceremony and the ritualistic \"Safar\" Bath. However, the meteoric rise of the new form of entertainments in the area resulted the gradual death of Zapin, superseded by the modern-karaoke and Dangdut celebrations by the locals. By the 1980s, the fatal blow was hit and the Zapin Api performance was declared extinct in the area.\n\nBy 2013, by the initiative of Pak Edwar, the head of the Bengkalis Tourism Department requested Pak Abdullah, the ringmaster of the traditional Zapin Api for a revival of the traditional dance art in the area. He enthusiastically began to recruit young men and nurture them about the Malay art form. Thus, commencing his journey on resurrecting the once extinct zapin api. Not long after, the dance is once again staged in the island.\n\nBased on the observation by Tom Ibnur, a Zapin-enthusiast, he observed that Zapin Zapi was a true fusion between the Arabic Zaffa which was orchestrated as a form of religious entertainment by the Islamic missionaries with the indigenous Malay firedance. The element of Zapin can be witnessed in the form of the rhythms and the coordinations, while the native pre-Islamic elements can clearly observed when the performers was in an unconscious hallucinations and hypnotic euphoria during the climax of the dance.\n\nThere are several strict rituals that must be adhered to by the ringleader, players and even the spectators. All the dancers, musicians and the instruments are required bathed upon a sacred water and smoked by mantras a few days before the performance. While during the Zapin, it is strongly prohibited for the spectators to light up any fires nor call the players name.\n\nThe performance begins when the participants reciting prayers with the burning incense. The court was then set with Bonfire made from burning coconut shell, as a preparation of the dance. The leader recite his mantras and commencing the Malay orchestra in the background to summon the spirits. He intensifies his mantras as the music plays along.\n\nThe players dance along with the orchestra, slowly one by one succumbed into a spellbinded position and drawn directly into the fire. They continued to dance erratically while playing with the fiery coconut shell. Some would collapse in ecstasy during the performance.\n\nWhen the music is set, the stage is alight and the zapin commenced, the performers usually recalled that the staged was suddenly transformed into a beautiful orchard and they were accompanied by a nymph who had suddenly emerged and leading them to dance. The performance may last several hours long, drawing many of the performers became unconscious after induced in a cataleptic affair.\n\nThe Zapin would only ends based on the discretion of the ringleader. Ironically, there was no sign of burning on the skins of the performers, despite spending hours of dwelling in the blazing fire.\n\nThe dance slowly gained wide recognition and interest following its revival from the stage of Bengkalis since 2013. The government of Riau Province also hailed the dance as among the components of the local tourist industry, drawing local and international crowds alike to witness its mystical performance.\n\n"}
