{"id": "74968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74968", "title": "A Movie", "text": "A Movie\n\nA Movie (styled as A MOVIE) is a 1958 experimental collage film by American artist Bruce Conner. It combines pieces of found footage taken from various sources such as newsreels, soft-core pornography, and B movies, all set to a score featuring Ottorino Respighi's \"Pines of Rome\".\n\nThe film is recognized as a landmark work in American experimental cinema, particularly as an early example of found footage. \"A Movie\" was inducted into the National Film Registry in 1994.\n\n\"A Movie\" opens with its longest shot, an extended production credit with Bruce Conner's name. After the opening credits, the countdown leader is interrupted by a shot of an undressed woman removing her stockings. Once the countdown completes, an intertitle falsely announces \"The End\" of the film. The film moves into a montage of cavalry, tanks, race cars, and a charging elephant.\n\nAnother false ending precedes footage of zeppelins and tightrope walkers. In one well-known sequence, a man in a submarine looks through a periscope to see a woman posing in a bikini, leading to the launch of a torpedo and a mushroom cloud. This leads to water sporting accidents and racing mishaps. As the musical score swells, a succession of violent scenes ensues, including aerial bombings, the \"Hindenburg\" disaster, and firing squads. The film closes with a scuba diver exploring a shipwreck.\n\nBruce Conner developed the concept for \"A Movie\" many years before he began working on it. He was inspired early on by a battle scene in the Marx Brothers' \"Duck Soup\" that builds a montage from stock footage. He envisioned a film combining images and sounds from many different movies and, when watching movies, often imagined possible sequences that could be created from them.\n\nConner and Larry Jordan began the Camera Obscura Film Society during the late 1950s. Conner was interested in the film leader used by projectionists that went unseen by the audience. He had a filmstrip given to him by writer Lee Streiff which showed a nude woman, and he thought about inserting the strip in the countdown leader at a Camera Obscura screening of \"Triumph of the Will\". When Jordan found out about the plan, he threatened to quit the society. Conner decided that the only way for him to carry out this vision would be to insert such a sequence in a film of his own.\n\nJordan showed Conner how to edit film and offered him the use of a Griswold film splicer. Describing cinema as \"a rich man's art form\", Conner looked to store-bought footage as an economical alternative to shooting original material. He purchased a condensed Hopalong Cassidy western, a short novelty film called \"Thrills and Spills\", a Castle home movie containing German propaganda, and a newsreel compilation titled \"Headlines of 1953\".\n\nConner primarily worked in assemblage at the time, and he originally planned to use the film as part of an installation piece. The installation would fill a cube into which people could walk. The film would have no soundtrack; instead, the installation would play the film as a loop with sound coming from tape players, radio, and television. However, Conner was not able to fulfill his original vision. The cost of a rear projection machine for the installation was prohibitively expensive.\nHe decided to make the film a stand-alone work and edited the segments together using a radio to time them. During one editing session, Respighi's \"Pines of Rome\" came on the radio and synced well with the ending. \"Pines of Rome\" had been used ten years earlier by Kenneth Anger for his avant-garde short film \"Fireworks\". Conner made a recording from the first, second, and fourth movements and added the music to the completed image track. He was unsure how to clear the rights to the music and used the recording without authorization. He completed the film on a budget of $350.\n\n\"A Movie\" premiered June 10, 1958, at the East and West Gallery in San Francisco. It was part of a reception for Conner's first solo art show. Shortly after, the film was acquired for distribution by Cinema 16 in New York. When local distributor Canyon Cinema emerged in the early 1960s, \"A Movie\" was one of its more well-known offerings.\n\nAt its 1960 Creative Film Awards Presentation, the Creative Film Foundation gave \"A Movie\" an Award of Distinction, with Michael McClure describing its comedy \"not [as] a free laugh but the reconstruction of human depth, achievement and emotion\". It has gone on to be recognized as a landmark piece of avant-garde cinema. In 1994, \"A Movie\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nFilmmaker Peter Hutton has cited \"A Movie\" as an influence on his work. Artist Christian Marclay first saw the film as a student, and it influenced his own practice of appropriating materials and establishing new connections between them. Alan Berliner's 1985 film \"Everywhere at Once\" uses \"Pines of Rome\" for its soundtrack in an homage to \"A Movie\". Jennifer Proctor remade it in 2010 as \"A Movie by Jen Proctor\". Her digital remake follows the original nearly shot for shot, using footage downloaded from YouTube and LiveLeak.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6901384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6901384", "title": "Artist's statement", "text": "Artist's statement\n\nAn artist's statement (or artist statement) is an artist's written description of their work. The brief verbal representation is for, and in support of, his or her own work to give the viewer understanding. As such it aims to inform, connect with an art context, and present the basis for the work; it is, therefore, didactic, descriptive, or reflective in nature.\n\nThe artist's text intends to explain, justify, extend, and/or contextualize his or her body of work. It places or attempts to place the work in relationship to art history and theory, the art world and the times. Further, the statement serves to show that the artist is conscious of their intentions, aware of their practice and its position within art parameters and of the discourse surrounding it. Therefore not only does it describe and place, but it indicates the level of the artist's own comprehension of their field and making. The artist statement serves as a \"vital link of communication between you [the artist], and the rest of the world.\" Most people encounter a work of art through a reproduction first, and there are many elements that are not present within a reproduction. That is why it is imperative that the artist knows how to properly convey their work through their own words. What the artist writes in their statement may be integrated in wall text, hand outs at an exhibition or a paragraph in a press release. Judgments will be made based both on the nature of the art, as well as the words that accompany it. \nArtists often write a short (50-100 word) and/or a long (500-1000 word) version of the same statement, and they may maintain and revise these statements throughout their careers. They may be edited to suit the requirements of specific funding bodies, galleries or call-outs as part of the application process.\n\nThe writing of artists' statements is a comparatively recent phenomenon beginning in the 1990s. In some respects, the practice resembles the art manifesto and may derive in part from it. However, the artist's statement generally speaks for an individual rather than a collective, and is not strongly associated with polemic. Rather, a contemporary artist may be required to submit the statement in order to tender for commissions or apply for schools, residencies, jobs, awards, and other forms of institutional support, in justification of their submission.\n\nIn their 2008 survey of North American art schools and university art programs, Garrett-Petts and Nash found that nearly 90% teach the writing of artist statements as part of the curriculum; in addition, they found that, \n\nLike prefaces, forewords, prologues, and introductions to literary works, the artist statement performs a vital if complex rhetorical role: when included in an exhibition proposal and sent to a curator, the artist statement usually provides a description of the work, some indication of the work's art historical and theoretical context, some background information about the artist and the artist's intentions, technical specifications – and, at the same time, it aims to persuade the reader of the artwork's value. When hung on a gallery wall, the statement (or \"didactic\") becomes an invitation, an explanation, and, often indirectly, an element of the installation itself.\n\nOn at least two occasions, artist's statements have been the subject of gallery exhibitions. The first exhibition of artists' statements, \"The Art of the Artist's Statement\", was curated by Georgia Kotretsos and Maria Pashalidou at the Hellenic Museum, Chicago, in the spring of 2005. It featured the work of 14 artists invited to create artwork offering a visual commentary on the subject of artist statements. The second exhibition, \"Proximities: Artists' Statements and Their Works\", was installed in the fall of 2005 at the Kamloops Art Gallery, Kamloops, British Columbia. Co-curated by W.F. Garrett-Petts and Rachel Nash, the exhibition asked nine contributing artists to respond to the topic of artists’ statements by taking one or more of their own artist’s statements and working with the text(s) in a manner that documented, represented, and annotated the original work, creating a new work in the process.\n\nArtist's statements have been the subject of a research project on the professional language of the contemporary art world by sociologist Alix Rule and artist David Levine. Presented in their 2012 article \"International Art English,\" published in the American art journal Triple Canopy, Levine & Rule collated and analysed thousands of gallery press releases, published by e-flux since 1999, in an attempt to dissect and understand the peculiar language of the professional art world. It has since become one of the most widely circulated pieces of online cultural criticism.\n\n"}
{"id": "2560301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2560301", "title": "Baemi", "text": "Baemi\n\nThe Baemi, (Bæmi) or Baimoi, were a Germanic tribe who are only known by their mention in Ptolemy's \"Geography\". He described them as a large tribe living on the north side of the Danube, near the Luna forest, and the Quadi, and with the Gambreta forest of the Marcomanni to their northwest. This would place them in or around modern Slovakia, Moravia and Lower Austria.\n\nCommentators generally compare the term to another one found in the same text (but located further north), the \"Bainochaimai\". And both terms are considered related to references to similar terms in older authors, Strabo and Tacitus, who were both referring to a place rather than an ethnic group. Strabo describes Boihaemum, as the domain of Marabodus, in the Hercynian forest, where he had moved some of his Suebian people and based his kingdom. Tacitus describes Boiemum in the same region, and specifically as a name derived from the more ancient Celtic tribe, the Boii, who had lived there in the past. The second element of these names is thought to derive from an old Germanic term meaning \"home of\" (cf the modern German \"\", English \"home\"; more at \"*haimaz\") therefore giving the complete term the meaning \"the place where the Boii lived\".\n\nThese terms survive today in the modern name Bohemia, and more generally the name of the Boii survives not only in \"Bohemia\" but also in the name of the neighbouring German region of Bavaria.\n\n"}
{"id": "1017477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1017477", "title": "Blonde stereotype", "text": "Blonde stereotype\n\nBlonde stereotypes are stereotypes of blond-haired people, especially women. Sub-types include the \"blonde bombshell\" and the \"dumb blonde\". Blondes are differently stereotyped from brunettes as more desirable and less intelligent. There are many blonde jokes made on these premises. Although chiefly aimed at women, jokes of this style have also been aimed at similar stereotypes associated with men, such as the \"dumb jock\" and the \"surfer dude\".\n\nThere are several aspects to the stereotypical perception of blonde-haired women. On one hand, over history, blonde hair in women has often been considered attractive and desirable. Blonde hair has been considered attractive for long periods of time in various European cultures, particularly when coupled with blue eyes. This perception is exploited in culture and advertising.\n\nIn contemporary popular culture, it is often stereotyped that men find blonde women more attractive than women with other hair colors. For example, Anita Loos popularized this idea in her 1925 novel \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\". Blondes are often assumed to have more fun; for example, in a Clairol commercial for hair colorant, they use the phrase \"Is it true blondes have more fun?\" Some women have reported they feel other people expect them to be more fun-loving after having lightened their hair. In much of the Americas, such as in North America, the blonde stereotype is also associated with being less serious or less intelligent.\n\nOn the other hand, a blonde woman is often perceived as making little use of intelligence and as a \"woman who relies on her looks rather than on intelligence.\" At the same time, people tend to presume that blondes are less serious-minded and less intelligent than brunettes, as reflected in \"blonde jokes\". The roots of this notion may be traced to Europe, with the \"dumb blonde\" in question being a French courtesan named Rosalie Duthé, satirised in a 1775 play \"Les Curiosites de la Foire\" for her habit of pausing a long time before speaking, appearing not only stupid but literally dumb (in the sense of mute). The latter stereotype of \"dumb blonde\" is exploited in blonde jokes. In Brazil, this extends to blonde women being looked down upon, as reflected in sexist jokes, as also sexually licentious.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock preferred to cast blonde women for major roles in his films as he believed that the audience would suspect them the least, comparing them to \"virgin snow that shows up the bloody footprints\", hence the term \"Hitchcock blonde\". This stereotype has become so ingrained it has spawned counter-narratives, such as in the 2001 film \"Legally Blonde\" in which Reese Witherspoon succeeds at Harvard despite biases against her beauty and blonde hair, and terms developed such as cookie cutter blonde (CCB), implying standardized blonde looks and standard perceived social and intelligence characteristics of a blonde. Many actors and actresses in Latin America and Hispanic United States have blond hair and blue eyes and/or pale skin, such as Christina Aguilera and Shakira.\n\nAnnette Kuhn divides blonde stereotypes in cinema into three categories in \"The Women's Companion to International Film\":\n\nIn cognitive linguistics, the stereotype uses expressivity of words to affect an emotional response which determines a gender role of a certain kind. In feminist critique, stereotypes like the blonde bombshell or the \"dumb blonde\" are seen as negative images that undermine the power of women.\n\nThe blonde bombshell is a gender stereotype that connotes a very attractive woman with blonde hair. The blonde bombshell is one of the most notable and consistently popular female character types in cinema. Many showbiz stars have used it to their advantage, including Jean Harlow, Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, Brigitte Bardot and Mamie Van Doren. A review of English language tabloids from the United Kingdom has shown it to be a recurring blonde stereotype, along with \"busty blonde\" and \"blonde babe\".\n\nJean Harlow started the stereotype with her film \"Bombshell\". Following her, Monroe, Mansfield and Van Doren helped establish the stereotype typified by a combination of curvaceous physique, very light-colored hair and a perceived lack of intelligence. During the 1950s, the \"blonde bombshell\" started to replace the \"Femme fatale\" as the mainstream media stereotype. Marjorie Rosen, the historian of women in films, says of the two top blonde bombshells of the time that \"Mae West, firing off vocal salvos with imperious self-assurance, and Jean Harlow, merchandising her physical allure for the masses, transformed the idea of passive female sexuality into an aggressive statement of fact\". In 1993, Sharon Stone hosted a documentary about Jean Harlow, \"Harlow: The Blonde Bombshell\".\n\nThe notion of \"dumb blonde\" has been a topic of academic research reported in scholarly articles and university symposia, which tend to confirm that many people hold to the perception that light-haired women are less intelligent than women with dark hair. While there is no evidence that suggests that blondes are less intelligent than other people, it has been suggested that the state of being blond creates opportunities that do not require investing in education and training. It is believed the originator of the \"dumb blonde\" was an 18th-century blonde French prostitute named Rosalie Duthé whose reputation of being beautiful but dumb inspired a play about her called \"Les Curiosites de la Foire\" (Paris 1775). The French tradition may be that blondes are fatally attractive, rather than merely \"dumb,\" as attested by the true story and myths associated with \"Casque d'Or,\" Amélie Hélie (1879-1933), commemorated in a public park in Paris.\n\nA possible explanation is that attractive women have less pressing incentives to cultivate and demonstrate their intellect in order to ensure their future, since attractiveness is an asset, or correlatively that intelligent women have less pressing incentives to dye their hair to a presumed attractive color. The validity of this explanation is corroborated by its applicability to a similar pervasiveness of the \"dumb athlete\" stereotype. The dumb blonde stereotype (and the associated cognitive bias) may have some negative consequences and it can also damage a blonde person's career prospects.\n\n\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" (a comic novel, a Broadway musical, and two films) explores the appeal of blonde women. The \"Encyclopedia of Hair\" describes Marilyn Monroe's blonde role as that of \"a fragile woman who relied on her looks rather than on intelligence—what some people refer to as 'dumb blonde'.\" At the same time, in the film she demonstrates a certain amount of wit regarding her life position expressed in her hit \"Diamonds are a girl's best friend\". Madonna emulated that screen-persona of Monroe in her music video \"Material Girl\".\n\nMany blonde actresses have played stereotypical \"dumb blondes\", including Monroe (dyed blonde), Judy Holliday, Jayne Mansfield (dyed blonde), Carol Wayne and Goldie Hawn, best known as the giggling \"dumb blonde\", stumbling over her lines, especially when she introduced Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In \"News of the Future\". In the American sitcom \"Three's Company\" the blonde girl (originally Chrissy played by Suzanne Somers, and later Cindy and Terri) is sweet and naïve, while the brunette (Janet played by Joyce DeWitt) is smart.\n\nCountry music legend Dolly Parton has embraced the \"dumb blonde\" stereotype as part of her naturally bubbly persona, even dedicating a song to it, Dumb Blonde.\nThere is a category of jokes called \"blonde jokes\" that employs the dumb blonde stereotype. It overlaps at times with other jokes that portray the subject of the joke as promiscuous and/or stupid. Some blonde jokes rely on sexual humour to portray or stereotype their subjects as promiscuous. Many of these are rephrased sorority girl or Essex girl jokes, much as other jokes about dumb blondes are based on long-running ethnic jokes. Many of these jokes are mere variants on traditional ethnic jokes or jests about other identifiable groups (such as Italian jokes involving Carabinieri, Sardarji jokes or Pathan jokes). Similar jokes about stereotyped minorities have circulated since the seventeenth century with only the wording and targeted groups changed.\n\nBlonde jokes have been criticized as sexist by several authors, as most blondes in these jokes are female, although male variations also exist. In fact, dumb blonde jokes are overwhelmingly female-specific: according to an extensive search in various publications and on the Internet, about 63% of dumb blonde jokes are directed exclusively at females (compared to less than 5% that directly referenced dumb blond men). Research indicates that because of this, men report being amused by blonde jokes significantly more than women do. The fact that in most of these jokes the target is invariably dim-witted, female and sexually promiscuous makes them even more sexist. In the 20th century, a class of meta-jokes about blondes (i.e. jokes about blonde jokes) has emerged. In a typical plot of this type a blonde complains about the unfairness of the stereotype propagated by blonde jokes, with a punch line actually reinforcing the stereotype.\n\nIn a November 16, 2011 article titled \"Blondes vs. Brunettes: TV Shows with Betty and Veronica-Style Love Triangles\", media critic Tucker Cummings cited several TV shows that featured a \"classic war between blonde and brunette love interests\", including \"The Office\" (where lighter haired Pam Beesly competes with brunette Karen Filipelli for the attention of Jim Halpert), \"Suits\" (where blonde Jenny Griffith competes with brunette Rachel Zane for the attention of Mike Ross), and \"Dexter\" (where blonde Rita Bennent and brunette Lila West compete for the affections of Dexter Morgan, the main character). Typically, she wrote, \"... the blonde (is) stable, and typifies the 'girl next door,' while (the) ... brunette, is haughty, and a bit more exotic.\" In Archie comics, Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge have been engaged in a mostly friendly competition for over 70 years.\n\nA number of studies have been conducted over the years to measure society's attitude toward blondes and brunettes. Many of the studies have shown that men, especially those of European descent, find blonde women more attractive than brunettes, redheads, or women of other races who had darker hair, eyes, or complexion. A Cornell University study showed that blonde waitresses receive larger tips than brunettes, even when controlling for other variables such as age, breast size, height and weight.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with NBC News, Dr. Lisa Walker, Sociology Department Chair at the University of North Carolina said that hair color \"absolutely\" plays a role in the way people are treated and claimed that numerous studies had shown that blonde women were paid higher salaries than other women. In a study by Diana J. Kyle and Heike I. M. Mahler (1996), the researchers asked subjects to evaluate photographs of the same woman with \"natural\" (not dyed) looking brown, red, and blonde hair in the context of a job application for an accounting position. The researchers found that the blonde-haired applicant was rated as significantly less capable than her brunette counterpart. In addition, participants designated the female applicant's starting salary as significantly lower when she was depicted as a blonde than when she was shown with brown hair.\n\nA study that looked at the CEOs of the London Financial Times Stock Exchange's (FTSE) top 500 companies investigated how hair color could be a potential barrier to professional success. In another study by Brian Bates, two sets MBA graduates were given the same Curriculum vitae of the same women split between two sets of attached photos - blonde and brunette. The brunette was considered more for a managerial position and for a higher salary. A 2011 University of Westminster study evaluated how men perceived women who entered a London nightclub as a blonde or a brunette. The study, published in the Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, used the same woman and had her dye her hair a different color for each visit. The results showed that, as a blonde, she was more likely to be approached for conversation than as a brunette. However, when the researchers interviewed the men who spoke to her, the men rated her more intelligent and attractive as a brunette than as a blonde.\n\nFrench magazine \"Le Monde\" believes that the rivalry is more prevalent in the United States. In a 2012 article, \"Le Monde\" argued that American TV has almost, without exception, characterized blonde women as having the positive values of purity, goodness, and sincerity, frequently at the expense of their brunette counterparts. The article provided several examples including \"Bewitched\" (where Samantha, the blonde witch, displays a sense of tolerance while her dark haired cousin Serena plays the wild one), \"Dynasty\" (where blonde Krystal pitted against brunette Alexis), and \"V\" (in both the original series in 1984 and the remake in 2009 shows an intelligent, humanistic blonde battling a brunette leader of the alien cannibals).\n\nIn Russia, according to a 2011 survey by the Southern Federal University, brunettes are considered more attractive than blondes. One theory forwards, as an explanation, the concept the feminization of blond hair, which can be seen by the overwhelming association of the dumb blond persona with females. This idea draws on the stereotype that females have a lower psychometric intelligence than males.\n\nAt the same time, there are many examples where the stereotype is exploited only to combat it. The film \"Legally Blonde\" starring Reese Witherspoon featured the stereotype as a centerpiece of its plot. However, the protagonist turns out to be very intelligent and is shown to have been underachieving due to society's low expectations of her.\n\nCountry music entertainer Dolly Parton, aware of this occasional characterization of her, addressed it in her 1967 hit \"Dumb Blonde\". Parton's lyrics challenged the stereotype, stating \"just because I'm blonde, don't think I'm dumb 'cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool\". Parton has said she was not offended by \"all the dumb-blonde jokes because I know I'm not dumb. I'm also not blonde.\"\n\nThe author of the comic strip \"Blondie\", Chic Young, starting with \"Dumb Dora\", gradually transformed the titular character into a smart, hard-working, family-oriented woman.\n\nIn \"The Simpsons\" episode \"To Surveil with Love\" Lisa faces prejudice with her brunette peers because of her blonde hair. She dyes her hair dark brown to prove her point that not all blondes are dumb and people need to look past every stereotype.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23641576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23641576", "title": "Cabin Pressure (radio series)", "text": "Cabin Pressure (radio series)\n\nCabin Pressure is a radio sitcom written and created by John Finnemore and directed and produced by David Tyler. It follows the exploits of the eccentric crew of the single aeroplane owned by \"MJN Air\" as they are chartered to take all manner of items, people or animals across the world. The show stars Finnemore, Stephanie Cole, Roger Allam and Benedict Cumberbatch. The series was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2008.\n\nCritical reception to the series was positive and four series have been broadcast, along with a special 2010 Christmas Day episode. The fourth series consisting of six episodes was broadcast in January and February 2013. The show's finale, entitled \"Zurich\", was broadcast as a two-part special on 23 and 24 December 2014. The series' opening music is Mikhail Glinka's Overture to \"Ruslan and Lyudmila\".\n\nThe story takes place at MJN Air, the world's smallest airline, consisting of just one 16-seater plane: a \"Lockheed McDonnell 312\", registration Golf Echo Romeo Tango India (G-ERTI), and thus nicknamed \"Gerti\". The company name derives from when owner Carolyn Knapp-Shappey (Stephanie Cole) was awarded Gerti as part of her divorce settlement with her awful Australian husband Gordon Shappey (Timothy West) and thus proudly proclaimed that Gerti was: \"My Jet Now\". The company is so small, with Carolyn joking that rather than an airline MJN is more of an \"airdot\" than an \"airline\", that everything is run on a tight budget and they are willing to take on any job to keep the business going. The company is based in the fictional Fitton Airport, located somewhere in the Midlands.\n\nEach episode is named after a different city (often a destination for MJN in the episode) each beginning with successive letters of the alphabet. The episodes were not broadcast in alphabetical order, but \"The Complete Cabin Pressure: From A to Z\" collection does play the episodes alphabetically.\n\nThe story follows the day-to-day working life of MJN Air and its crew of four: Carolyn (Stephanie Cole), the owner and stewardess; First Officer Douglas Richardson (Roger Allam), an experienced pilot formerly at Air England until he was sacked for smuggling; Captain Martin Crieff (Benedict Cumberbatch), whose love of flying and planes is let down by his lack of natural ability; and Arthur Shappey (John Finnemore), Carolyn's overexcited and idiotic son who works as a steward.\n\nMuch of the plot revolves around the relationship between Douglas and Martin. While Martin is the captain, Douglas is more experienced, and most people consider Douglas to be superior to him in almost every way. When meeting both men most guests mistakenly believe Douglas to be the captain rather than Martin. Carolyn refers to Douglas as the \"good pilot\" and Martin as the \"safe pilot\". Also, while Douglas gets paid, Martin does not because Carolyn cannot afford it. Thus Martin also has a second job with his own business, Icarus Removals, using a van he inherited from his late father, and lives a life of poverty.\n\nDouglas, meanwhile, has to do his job in order to pay two different alimonies, and tries to keep secret from his third wife Helena that he is not a captain. It is later revealed that Helena is having an affair. Douglas is also a recovering alcoholic, having been sober for a period of several years at the time the story begins, although he tries to prevent anyone else from knowing about it, fearing it will tarnish his image.\n\nMuch of the time spent on the flight-deck is spent with the crew playing various games to pass the time such as \"People Who Aren't Evil But Have Evil Sounding Names\", \"Brians of Britain\", \"Books That Sound More Interesting with the Final Letter Knocked Off\" (e.g. \"Three Men in a Boa\", \"Of Mice and Me\") and \"The Travelling Lemon\", in which the crew try to hide a lemon in plain sight of the passengers without anyone complaining. This is the origin of the phrase \"The lemon is in play,\" used by Douglas in the episodes Qikiqtarjuaq and Zurich Part 2. \n\nThough MJN squabble among themselves, in several episodes the crew unite to combat a common enemy or problem. A recurring antagonist is Gordon Shappey (Timothy West), Carolyn's ex-husband and Arthur's father, who resents Carolyn obtaining the jet in the divorce and frequently tries to reacquire it through fair means and foul. Other recurring characters include Mr Birling (Geoffrey Whitehead), who every year hires the plane to take him to see the final match in the Six Nations Rugby Union tournament. On \"Birling Day\", the crew toady to Birling in the hope that he will give them all large tips. Every Birling Day Douglas attempts to steal Birling's whisky and sell it on while Carolyn and the rest of the crew try to stop him.\n\nAnother recurring character is Captain Hercules \"Herc\" Shipwright (Anthony Head), a former colleague of Douglas who now works at Scottish airline Air Caledonia. Herc is an occasional rival to Douglas and a love interest to Carolyn, though she is reluctant to reciprocate Herc's affections.\n\nPrincess Theresa of Liechtenstein (Matilda Ziegler) appears in the final season, first appearing when she hires MJN to take her younger brother and ruling monarch King Maxi to Fitton so he can return to school. She and Martin begin a romantic relationship.\n\nIn the two-part series finale Martin is given a paid job at Swiss Air, which means MJN has to close down and Gerti has to be sold. However, when Gordon tries to purchase Gerti, Arthur puts in a gigantic bid to stop his father from buying the plane. Douglas suspects that there is something valuable hidden on the plane and MJN manage to buy back Gerti. His suspicions prove correct when he discovers that Gordon had replaced the wiring of the plane with gold, not expecting that Carolyn would get the plane in their divorce. Martin concludes he is more skilled pilot than he thought, having been struggling in the past years with a poorly weighted plane, and the solution to Carolyn's financial problems has been right under her nose all along. Carolyn uses the money to secure the company's future, renaming it OJS Air (\"Our Jet Still\"). Martin takes up his new job securing paid employment and living close to Princess Theresa, Douglas is promoted to Captain, and Herc — who accepts a downwards career move due to his affections for Carolyn — is hired as the new First Officer. The series ends with OJS flying to Addis Ababa, bringing the alphabetical progression of cities full circle.\n\nWriting in \"The Independent\" newspaper, Nicholas Lezard praised the first series highly, called \"the writing and performances ... exceptional\" and suggested that the show \"deserves an award\". Gillian Reynolds of \"The Daily Telegraph\" called \"Cabin Pressure\" \"one of the best written, cast, acted and directed comedies on anywhere.\"\n\nPartly due to the popularity of leading actor Benedict Cumberbatch, the show has a significant fandom, and its final episode received a record number of requests for audience tickets for a Radio 4 comedy recording: 22,854 requests for just 200 available tickets. It has been argued that this is an example of the Odagiri effect occurring in western media.\n\n\"Cabin Pressure\" was nominated for a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, John Finnemore won the Best Radio Comedy 2011, awarded by the Writers' Guild of Great Britain.\n\nIt was nominated for the Best Scripted Comedy category at the 2012 BBC Audio Drama Awards.\n\nThe series has won numerous Comedy.co.uk Awards, voted for by readers of the British Comedy Guide. The series won the award for \"Best British Radio Sitcom\" for 2011, 2013, and 2014. Also it was voted \"Comedy of the Year\" across TV and radio for 2014, making it the first radio show to be given the honour.\n\nThe episode titles follow an alphabetical sequence, beginning with the first episode, \"Abu Dhabi\", followed by \"Boston\" etc. In Series 2 and 3 episodes were broadcast out of the original intended order for various reasons. The episodes however are listed in alphabetical order in \"The Complete Cabin Pressure: From A To Z\" collection, and Finnemore has stated that the series was always meant to be heard alphabetically.\n\nFinnemore announced a fourth series consisting of six episodes recorded in December 2012 and January 2013. It was broadcast from 9 January 2013.\n\nA number of CD releases for the show have been made by BBC Physical Audio and the production company Pozzitive.\n\n"}

This ranking is determined by the extent of availability of the Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Programs in the school's curriculum and the number of graduating students. \n\nFor each school, the study tallies the total number of AP and IB exams are taken that year in the high school. This sum is divided by the number of students graduating in that same year. This ratio is the Challenge Index. Not incorporated with the study are magnet schools, or any school that accepts over 50% of its students via a placement test or other type of admission criterion. The study effectively demonstrates the public schools with greatest opportunity for all students to challenge themselves with college level courses. \n\nHowever, critics argue that this ranking system does a disservice by not taking into consideration the actual performance of the student exams, but merely the quantity of exams taken. Administrators of the study acknowledge that the system is \"not a measurement of the overall quality of the school but illuminates one factor that many educators consider important.\"\nThe validity of the Challenge Index has been strongly criticized by education analysts Andrew J. Rotherham and Sara Mead of Education Sector in Washington, DC. Their 2006 paper,Challenged Index showed how many schools that are among the top 100 nationally, according to Newsweek, actually have high dropout rates and wide gaps in achievement separating students by race and income. A summary of their argument appeared recently in The Washington Post and Jay Mathews responded. \n\nThe editors, primarily Jay Mathews, defend their ratings by citing recent studies by U.S. Department of Education senior researcher Clifford Adelman. In 1999 and 2005, Adelman showed that the best predictor of college graduation was not good high-school grades or test scores, but whether or not a student had an intense academic experience in high school. The demands of higher level, college-type courses in high school would, according to \"Newsweek\", provide that experience. The editors are critical of some other indices of school excellence, such as \"US News & World Report\" “America’s Best Colleges”, as including too many factors, and of American high schools in general, since only 5% of all US high schools make the \"Newsweek\" list by having at least 1 AP or IB test score per each graduating senior.\n\nTabulated results of the Challenge Index are published for Washington area high schools in the Washington Post annually. Newsweek also publishes nationwide results each year.\n\n"}

Although most of the time, letters are formed by using a simple consonant with the inherent value vowel \"a\" (as with \"k\" , pronounced \"ka\" in Brahmi), or by combining a consonant with an vowel in the form of an diacritic (as with \"ki\" in Brahmi), the usage of conjunct consonant permits the creation of more sophisticated sounds (as with \"kya\" , formed with the consonants k and y assembled verticaly). Conjuncts are often used with loan words. Native words typically use the basic consonant and native speakers know to suppress the vowel.\n\nIn modern Devanagari the components of a conjunct are written left to right when possible (when the first consonant has a vertical stem that can be removed at the right), whereas in Brahmi characters are joined vertically downwards. \n\nSome simple examples of conjunct consonants in Devanagari are: त + व = त्व tva, ण + ढ = ण्ढ ṇḍha, स + थ = स्थ stha, where the vertical stroke of the first letter is simply lost in the combination. Sometimes, conjunct consonants are not clearly derived from the letters making up their components: the conjunct for kṣ is क्ष (क् + ष) and for jñ it is ज्ञ (ज् + ञ). \n\nConjunct consonants are used in many other scripts as well, usually derived from the Brahmi script. In Balinese, conjunct consonants are called \"Haksara Wrehastra\".\n\nConjunct consonant are not limited to Brahmic languages, and can be seen in Navajo for example.\n"}

Recycled cotton may come from older, previously used garments or by textile leftovers which are then spun into new yarns and fabrics. There are some notable limitations of recycled cotton, including separation of materials that are cotton/polyester mix. There may also be limits to durability in using recycled cotton.\n\nCotton can be recycled from pre-consumer (post-industrial) and post-consumer cotton waste. Pre-consumer waste comes from any excess material produced during the production of yarn, fabrics and textile products, e.g. selvage from weaving and fabric from factory cutting rooms. Post-consumer waste comes from discarded textile products, e.g. used apparel and home textiles. During the recycling process, the cotton waste is first sorted by type and color and then processed through stripping machines that first breaks the yarns and fabric into smaller pieces before pulling them apart into fiber. The mix is carded several times in order to clean and mix the fibers before they are spun into new yarns.\n\nThe resulting staple fiber is of shorter length compared to the original fiber length, meaning it is more difficult to spin. Recycled cotton is therefore often blended with virgin cotton fibers to improve yarn strengths. Commonly, not more than 30% recycled cotton content is used in the finished yarn or fabric.\n\nBecause waste cotton is often already dyed, re-dyeing may not be necessary. Cotton is an extremely resource-intense crop in terms of water, pesticides and insecticides. This means that using recycled cotton can lead to significant savings of natural resources and reduce pollution from agriculture. Recycling one tonne of cotton can save 765 cubic metres (202,000 US gal) of water.\n\nRecycled cotton is often combined with recycled plastic bottles to make clothing and textiles, creating sustainable, earth-conscious products. Recycled cotton can also be used in industrial settings as polishing and wiper cloths and can even be made into new, high-quality paper. When reduced to its fibrous state, cotton can be used for applications like seat stuffing or home and automotive insulation. It is also sold as recycled cotton yarn for consumers to create their own items. Additionally, cotton waste can be made into a stronger, more durable paper than traditional wood-pulp based paper, which may contain high concentration of acids. Cotton paper is often used for important documents and also for bank notes since it does not wear off as easily. Cotton waste can also be used to grow mushrooms (particularly the indoor cultivation of Volvariella volvacea otherwise known as Straw Mushrooms).\n\nEven though recycling cotton cuts down on the harsh process of creating brand new cotton products, it is a natural fiber and is biodegradable, so any cotton fibers that cannot be recycled or used further can be composted and will not take up space in landfills.\n\n\n\n"}

The Falkland Islands have a large non-native born population, mainly white and from England (and to a much lesser extent, other parts of the British Isles), but also from Saint Helena.\n\nThe native born population is mainly of English and Scottish descent, with other strains such as Gibraltarian.\n\nThe English language is used, mainly in its British English form. However, due to the isolation of the islands, the small population retains its own accent/dialect. In rural areas (i.e. anywhere outside Port Stanley), known as \"Camp\" (from Spanish \"campo\", \"countryside\"), the Falkland accent tends to be stronger. The dialect has resemblances to Australian, New Zealand, West Country and Norfolk dialects of English, as well as Lowland Scots.\n\nOther notable Falkland island terms are the words \"kelper\" meaning a person who lives in the Falklands, etymologically, the term comes from the kelp surrounding the islands (although this term is sometimes considered pejorative); and \"smoko\" referring to a smoking break.\n\nThe official language of \"Falkland Islands\" is English and also spoken languages in the Falkland Islands are Lowland Scots, Spanish (mostly spoken by Chileans, with some Spaniards), Yaghan and French.\n\nDue to the low population of the islands, most of the literature of the islands has been written by outsiders, and is non-fiction. However some poetry has been written by Falklanders, including, Ernest Spencer's \"Motherland\".\n\nThe \"1911 Britannica\" states:\n\nThe government barrack is now a guesthouse and is somewhat more in keeping with the surrounding houses.\n\nSince this date, many more buildings have been erected in Stanley. In 1998, the Government of the Falkland Islands started a programme to encourage building of private houses, the development is known as East Stanley as it developed Stanley to the East. This led to a boom in the housing construction market with many new timber kit houses imported, largely from Scotland. These range from single bedroom bungalows to large 4-5 bedroom houses, the style of cladding and colours varying immensely.\n\nFalkland houses are renowned for being brightly painted with immaculately maintained gardens, older houses frequently have intricately carved wooden fascia boards.\n\nThe Bodie Creek Suspension Bridge is sometimes stated to be the most southerly in the world.\n\nThere is one major newspaper, the Penguin News and also a radio station the Falkland Islands Radio Service (FIRS).\n\nThe islands also have their own national football team and national cricket team.\n\n"}
{"id": "7398725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7398725", "title": "Cyprian and Justina", "text": "Cyprian and Justina\n\nSaints Cyprian and Justina are honored in the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodoxy as Christians of Antioch, who in 304, during the persecution of Diocletian, suffered martyrdom at Nicomedia (modern-day İzmit, Turkey) on September 26. It is, however, certain that no Bishop of Antioch bore the name of Cyprian.\n\nThe story must have arisen as early as the 4th century, as it is mentioned both by St. Gregory Nazianzen and Prudentius; both, nevertheless, have conflated Cyprian with St. Cyprian of Carthage, a mistake often repeated. The attempt has been made to find in Cyprian a mystical prototype of the Faustian legend. The legend is given in Greek and Latin in \"Acta SS.\" September, VII. Ancient Syriac and Ethiopic versions of it have been published.\n\nCyprian, known by the title of the magician, to distinguish him from Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, received a liberal education in his youth, and particularly applied himself to astrology; after which he traveled for improvement through Greece, Egypt, India, etc. Cyprian was a magician in Antioch and dealt in sorcery. \n\nJustina of Antioch is a Christian saint, known for converting Cyprian, a pagan magician of Antioch. She is said to have been martyred in the year 304 AD. Justina was said to have been a young woman who took private vows of chastity and was killed during the persecutions of the Roman emperor Diocletian. \n\nThe outline of the legend or allegory is found with diffuse descriptions and dialogues in the unreliable \"Symeon Metaphrastes\" and was made the subject of a poem by Empress Aelia Eudocia.\n\nA would-be suitor sought a magic spell to induce Justina to marry him. The charms had no effect on Justina, who spent her time in prayer and fasting. Brought to despair, Cyprian made the sign of the cross himself and in this way was freed from the toils of Satan. He was received into the Church, was made pre-eminent by miraculous gifts, and became in succession deacon, priest and, finally, bishop, while Justina became the abbess of a convent. \n\nShe is mentioned in \"Foxe's Book of Martyrs\". It was under the 10th Persecution in 303 AD while Diocletian was Emperor of Rome. It says:\n\" In the course of time he [Cyprian] became acquainted with Justina, a young lady of Antioch, whose birth, beauty, and accomplishments, rendered her the admiration of all who knew her. A pagan gentleman applied to Cyprian, to promote his suit with the beautiful Justina; this he undertook, but soon himself converted, burnt his books of astrology and magic, received baptism, and felt animated with a powerful spirit of grace. The conversion of Cyprian had a great effect on the pagan gentleman who paid his addresses to Justina, and he in a short time embraced Christianity. During the persecutions of Diocletian, Cyprian and Justina were seized upon as Christians, the former was torn with pincers, and the latter chastised; and, after suffering other torments, both were beheaded.\"\n\nDuring the Diocletian persecution, both were seized and taken to Damascus, where they were tortured. As their faith never wavered, they were brought before Diocletian at Nicomedia, where at his command they were beheaded on the bank of the river Gallus. The same fate befell a Christian, Theoctistus, who observing Cyprian's faith, declared himself a Christian.\n\nAfter the bodies of the saints had lain unburied for six days, they were taken by Christian sailors to Rome, where they were interred on the estate of a noble lady named Rufina and later were entombed in Constantine's basilica.\n\nTheir feast day appeared in the calendar of Roman Rite celebrations from the thirteenth century until 1969, when it was removed because of the lack of historical evidence of their existence. Their names were also removed from the subsequent (2001) revision of the Roman Martyrology, the official but professedly incomplete list of saints recognized by the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Martyrology, however, includes five saints called Cyprian and two named Justina. Some traditionalist Catholics continue to observe pre-1970 versions of the Roman Calendar.\n\nCharles Borromeo dedicated the chapel of the Collegio Borromeo (built in 1561) in Pavia to her.\n\nSaint Justina's [of Padua???] remains rest in the Church of Saint Anthony, in Lisbon, after being transferred from St. Lawrence's Cemetery in Rome by Pope Pius VI in 1777.\n\nThe Spanish author, Pedro Calderón de la Barca, took the story as the basis of a drama: \"El mágico prodigioso\". In 2005, American author Tono Rondone published a novel, \"The Martyrs\", which is a continuation of this tradition.\n\"The Great Book of Saint Cyprian\" is full of prayers and spells, and is widely sold in the Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking world.\n\n\"Cyprianus\" is a popular name for a grimoire in Scandinavian folklore.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "923343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=923343", "title": "Ethnoarchaeology", "text": "Ethnoarchaeology\n\nEthnoarchaeology is the ethnographic study of peoples for archaeological reasons, usually through the study of the material remains of a society (see David & Kramer 2001). Ethnoarchaeology aids archaeologists in reconstructing ancient lifeways by studying the material and non-material traditions of modern societies. Ethnoarchaeology also aids in the understanding of the way an object was made and the purpose of what it is being used for. Archaeologists can then infer that ancient societies used the same techniques as their modern counterparts given a similar set of environmental circumstances.\n\nOne good example of ethnoarchaeology is that of Brian Hayden (1987), whose team examined the manufacture of Mesoamerican quern-stones, providing valuable insights into the manufacture of prehistoric quern-stones. Many other studies have focused on the manufacture and use of ceramics, architecture, food, fiber, and other types of material culture. In the best cases, these studies have involved long term ethnographic fieldwork (for example, Herbich 1987, Kramer 1997, Deal 1998, Dietler & Herbich 1998, Hinshaw 2000, Longacre & Skibo 2000, Kohn 2010).\n\nAlthough ethnography has long been used by archaeologists to draw analogies to the past, ethnographic data is not gathered with specifically archaeological goals in mind. Ethnoarchaeology developed as a response to the feeling among archaeologists that ethnography did not adequately answer their own specific research questions.\n\nAmerican archaeologist Jesse Walter Fewkes first mentioned the \"ethno-archaeologist\" in 1900, and encouraged archaeologists to conduct their own ethnographic field work. Widespread acceptance of ethnoarchaeology as a true subdiscipline of archaeology did not emerge until the late 1950s and 1960s, as archaeologists began to explore the different scientific applications it might have.\nEthnoarchaeology today has become a widely accepted research practice, with a few archaeologists even identifying as \"ethnoarchaeologists\" rather than simply \"archaeologists.\" \n\nAnalogy in archaeology is, essentially, applying observed behavior to non-observed behavior. It is perhaps one of the most used research tools in archaeological interpretation. Analogies can best be drawn between those cultures who share similar environments. More importantly, these cultures must interact with their habitats in ways that are comparable to one another.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that analogies can only provide clues and not sound, definitive answers to research questions. For this reason, G.S. McCall calls for a comparative view for analysis in his cross-cultural study of the Gamo and Konso of southern and central Ethiopia, the Siberian Chukchi, highland New Guinea, highland Maya of Guatemala and Mexico, central, northern, and western arid regions of Australia, the Tjmba of northern Namibia, and the Xeta of Amazonia and their uses of lithics.\n\nFormal analogies are made with the assumption that, as Paul Lane describes, \"because two objects or contexts share a similar appearance or shape, they are likely to share other properties as well, typically that of function.\" One of the major issues with this approach is that often these objects or contexts that initially appeared similar may have been used for very different purposes or served different functions. Perhaps the different objects were even created differently. In a 1971 study, Gould and his team compared working edge angle of Mousterain Quina scrapers and modern Western Desert Aboriginal scrapers and found the Mousterain angles to be steeper. Gould reasoned this was due to the Western Desert Aborigines retouching the scrapers further than the Hominids of the Mousterian. Gould et al. concluded that this method of studying ethnographic tool use for comparison could be employed to determine what tools were used for.\n\nRelational analogies are opposite from formal analogies. Instead of just drawing the conclusions, one must prove the relationship, and both sides of the analogy are studied and a relationship must be demonstrated between the ethnographic object and the archaeological object.\n\nOne popular method in ethnoarchaeology is the use of the direct historical approach. This approach relies on living cultures that may be closely genetically or spatially related to the archaeological culture of interest in order to form analogies that may be used to explain findings. Gould and his team explains how archaeologists should be able to measure the degree of differences between the tools found with the ethnographic material and the artifacts However, while this technique may be useful it is important to note that it does not account for cultural change over time. The \"folk cultural approach\" is the Old World equivalent to this and the term may be used in place of the direct historical approach.\n\nEthnography can provide insights of value to archaeologists into how people in the past may have lived, especially with regard to their social structures, religious beliefs and other aspects of their culture. However, it is still unclear how to relate most of the insights generated by this anthropological research to archaeological investigations. This is due to the lack of emphasis by anthropologists on the material remains created and discarded by societies and on how these material remains vary with differences in how a society is organised.\n\nThis general problem has led archaeologists (for example, London <nowiki>[2000]</nowiki>) to argue that anthropological work is not adequate for answering archaeological problems, and that archaeologists should therefore undertake ethnoarchaeological work to answer these problems. These studies have focused far more on the manufacture, use and discard of tools and other artifacts and have sought to answer such questions as what kinds of objects used in a living settlement are deposited in middens or other places where they may be preserved, and how likely an object is to be discarded near to the place where it was used.\n\nAnother issue often faced in ethnoarchaeology is the potential for a single archaeological situation to have multiple possible analogies drawn from it. A process of elimination must take place to narrow down all of the possibilities until the best solution can be discovered.\n\n\n"}

During the 18th and 19th centuries, a feu de joie has celebrated a military victory or birthday. In recent years, it has marked, in Royal presence, the 80th Birthday and Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, as well as the Royal Air Force Centenary. Feux de joie also mark annual national or army days in, e.g., Canada, Malta, Nepal and Singapore.\n\nA spectacular feu de joie ran up and down double lines of infantrymen at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, on 6 May 1778 to celebrate the alliance between the newly independent United States of America with France.The men were placed in specified positions to fire a feu de joie with muskets and cannon—three times three discharges of thirteen cannon. At the first the army huzzaed, \"Long live the King of France\"; at the second, \"Long live the friendly European powers\"; and at the third there was a shout, \"The American States.\"\n\nFrom his headquarters at Ross Hall, General George Washington ordered a \"feu de joie\" to celebrate the anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\nIn May 1782 a feu de joie at West Point celebrated the birth of the Dauphin of France, and was witnessed by a Dr. Thacher.The arbor was, in the evening, illuminated by a vast number of lights, which, being arranged in regular and tasteful order, exhibited a scene vying in brilliancy with the starry firmament. The officers having rejoined their regiments, thirteen cannon were again fired as a prelude to the general feu-de-joie, which immediately succeeded throughout the whole line of the army on the surrounding hills, and being three times repeated, the mountains resounded and echoed like tremendous peals of thunder, and the flashing from thousands of firearms in the darkness of the evening, could be compared only to the most vivid flashes of lightning from the clouds. The feu-de-joie was immediately followed by three shouts of acclamation and benediction for the Dauphin by the united voices of the whole army on all sides.\n\nThe same event was also recollected by Captain Eben Williams:At a given signal, a running fire began at the south end of the line and extended along the west side of the river to the north end, when the feu-de-joie was caught by the troops on the opposite side of the river and carried south. Thus did the rattle of musketry three times make its distant circuit along the Hudson . . . .\n\nOn Tuesday 26 January 1841, west of the centre of the north shore of Hong Kong Island, British sailors and Marines - under Commodore James John Gordon Bremer of HMS Calliope - went ashore to claim the island for Britain. They gave 'three cheers', drank their queen's health, raised the British flag and gave forth a feu de joie, on the spot that became known as 'Possession Point'. Today, the site is marked by Hollywood Road Park.\nIn his book \"The King's Shilling,\" Gordon Johnson Walker remembered how the feu-de-joie was incorporated into the annual ceremony held on the first day of every New Year when the reigning Monarch was proclaimed ‘Emperor of India’. This was known as the Proclamation Parade - \"Each soldier had a blank cartridge, which, on the command, he would load into his rifle and fire a salute known as a 'feu-de-joie', which set the seal on the proceedings.\"\n\nQueen Victoria's proclamation as Empress of India in Delhi on 1 January 1877 was followed by a feu de joie described by Field Marshal Lord Roberts.A salute of one hundred and one salvos of artillery was fired, with a feu-de-joie from the long line of troops. This was too much for the elephants. As the feu-de-joie approached nearer and nearer to them, they became more and more alarmed, and at last scampered off, dispersing the crowd in every direction.\n\nAt the 1911 Delhi Coronation Durbar of King George V, a feu de joie followed the 101-Gun Salute during the State Entry ceremony on 12 December 1911.\n\nNumerous feux de joie were performed to commemorate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth on 2 June 1953. These ranged from elaborate ceremonies at home and in Europe, to a \"combat\" feu de joie in Korea.\n\nFeux de joie have marked occasions of national rejoicing. These often take place on the Forecourt of Buckingham Palace, in the presence of the Royal Family.\n\nAs part of Elizabeth II's 80th birthday celebrations, a spectacular feu de joie occurred on the Forecourt of Buckingham Palace on 17 June 2006 following the RAF flypast after Trooping the Colour. (Although there was a feu de joie outside the Commonwealth buildings in Berlin, 1953 to mark her coronation, this was the first feu de joie during Her Majesty's reign to be performed in her presence.)\n\nA cascade of rounds was fired by the Old Guard, the New Guard and six Half Companies of Street-Liners in the Forecourt of the Palace. The cascades of blank gunshots were interspersed with the National Anthem, \"God Save the Queen\". After the feu de joie the troops on the Forecourt laid down their weapons, removed their headgear and gave \"Three Cheers for Her Majesty The Queen\".\n\nOn 5 June 2012 a weekend of celebrations for the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II culminated in a feu de joie given at Buckingham Palace. This followed a Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral, reception at Mansion House, a luncheon given in her honour by the Livery at Westminster Hall, and a balcony appearance with flypast by the Red Arrows and historic aircraft, including the last flying Lancaster bomber in Britain.\n\nOn 10th July 2018, this was officially celebrated with a service at Westminster Abbey, attended by the Royal Family. The Queen presented a new Queen's Colour to the Royal Air Force. Then followed a historic flypast of 100 aircraft over Buckingham Palace, watched by the Royal Family from the Palace balcony and an estimated 70,000 people on The Mall and in surrounding streets and Royal Parks. The celebrations culminated in several feux de joie fired on the Forecourt of the Palace, interspersed with sections of the National Anthem as on the Queen's 80th birthday.\n\nThe Royal Military College of Canada also performs a feu de joie on the annual graduation parade where the graduates are commissioned. The feu de joie is performed with 500 C7 rifles on average.\n\nAt the Cadet Summer Training Centre Blackdown, as well as Cadet Summer Training Centre Vernon, cadets from the Alpha and Foxtrot Companies (Drill & Ceremonial Instructor Course) perform a feu de joie in the camp's annual \"Sunset Ceremony.\" This is performed with Lee–Enfield No.4 rifles.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Malta performs a feu de joie on Republic Day.\n\nThe Nepal Army performs a feu de joie as part of the Army Day celebrations that coincide with the Hindu festival of Mahashivaratri. The feu de joie is generally performed using the 1A1 Self Loading Rifle (SLR), a variant of the L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle, manufactured in India.\n\nThe venue of the celebrations is the Royal Nepal Army Pavilion in Tundikhel, a relatively large open space in the city center is the venue of the Army Day celebration and the events there in.\n\nThe Guards-of-Honour (GOH) from the three Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) branches (the Army, the Navy and the Air Force), together with their counterparts from the Singapore Police Force (SPF), performs the feu-de-joie as a standard element of the country's National Day celebrations on the 9th of August every year.

It has been serialized by Kadokawa Shoten in the magazine \"Monthly Shōnen Ace\" and collected in twelve \"tankōbon\" volumes. The English version was then released digitally on BookWalker on October 29, 2014. A prequel anime series, \"\", aired from October 5, 2008 to December 21, 2008, which details the backstory of key characters Kagura and Yomi.\n\nKensuke Nimura is just your average high school student—except for the fact that he can see spirits. This ability generally hinders him more than it helps him, especially in trying to get a girlfriend. However, everything changes when he encounters Kagura Tsuchimiya while being pursued by evil spirits. They accidentally kiss and manage to destroy a source of energy drawing the evil spirits. A few days later, Kagura transfers into Kensuke's class, much to his surprise. Kagura is an agent of a government agency that defends the public against supernatural enemies. She wields a \"Ga-rei\", a \"spirit devourer,\" named Byakuei that she uses to fight. Kensuke's spiritual awareness and his attraction to Kagura compels him to follow her to the agency, where he is recruited to fight the supernatural.\n\nTheir first enemy is Yomi Isayama, Kagura's best friend, now an evil spirit due to a stone known as a \"sesshouseki\" embedded in her forehead. Also introduced is another old friend, the perverted Izuna Noriyuki. Yomi tries to release an ancient immortal demon sealed under Tokyo. The Agency manage to stop her after a long battle, resealing the demon and putting Yomi to rest in the process. A mysterious boy removes her \"sesshouseki\" and disappears.\n\nThe next story arc concerns the re-emergence of the \"Juugondō\" organization and its heir, Shizuru Imawano. She encounters and alternatively threatens and flirts with Kensuke, angering Kagura. Soon, a contest begins between her and Kagura as to who can collect more \"sesshōseki\", with Kensuke—and the \"Kyūbi-kitsune\" (or nine-tailed fox)—as the prize. The pressure is building as Kagura starts losing control of Byakuei and the \"Juugondō\" arrive in full force. Shockingly, Shizuru's long-lost sister Setsuna arrives, kills her father and takes over the \"Juugondō\". She attacks and demolishes the Agency and the government try to distance themselves from the Agency for fear of revealing secrets to the public.\n\nKagura, Kensuke, Kyouko and Iwahata survive and meet Izuna and Shizuru at an agency hideout. After resting, the group faces off against Setsuna inside Tamamo-no-Mae's garden, with Kagura as the winner. However, Kensuke was gravely injured in the battle, leading Kagura to use the power of the \"sesshōseki\" to save his life. As a result, she loses control and becomes the core of the newly created Kyūbi, destroying the center of Tokyo. Kensuke manages to reach the Kyūbi, using his new \"Michael Revolution\" sword to free Kagura.\n\nDue to her brief time as the Kyūbi's core, Kagura has suffered amnesia, much to everyone's shock. She and Kensuke resume their daily lives at school, but start investigating ghosts alongside Kensuke, Tanaka, and Izumi, a new student who bears a resemblance to Yomi. Investigations lead the group closer to \"Naraku\", the area in Tokyo destroyed by the Kyūbi and now filled with spirits. Kensuke later meets Mikado and Tsuina from the Agency. A few days later, Kensuke and Izumi are attacked by Kirin, a black wolflike monster from \"Naraku\", who cuts Kensuke's right eye. Izumi is later revealed to be Yomi, who has dissociative identity disorder, alternating between Yomi and Izumi. When the revived Agency imprisons Izumi with the intention of exorcising Yomi, which will likely kill Izumi as well, Kagura breaks her free and the two go on the run. Kagura resolves to defend Yomi, disregarding others' opinions. Fending evil spirits and eventually the escorts of the Black Priestess—Yomi—they are cornered on a snow-covered cliff. There, Kensuke and Tsuina arrive to save them, leading to Kagura completely regaining her memories. The ensuing ruckus causes the cliff to collapse, causing them to fall near Micheal Kohara's residence, where Izuna and Shizune find them unconscious.\n\nAfter recovering, Kensuke and the others learn of Earth's impending destruction at the Black Priestess's (Yomi) hands and the White Priestess's (Kagura) potential to stop it. While everyone recuperates from resulting disbelief, government agents arrive to efface them: Izuna sacrifices himself for Yomi, relieving his guilt at allowing her previous deaths. She retreats with her retainers, mired in sorrow and her miasma, despite Kagura's pleas. After resurrecting Izuna with an escort's soul, Yomi arrives at Tokyo's Naraku, releasing all her miasma and disrupting the \"Reimyaku\". Consequently, this gives rise to Immortals and \"Naraku\"s worldwide. Kagura, Micheal, Kensuke, Tsuina and Shizuru search for Yomi. Following clashes with the Tengu, Okama and a revived Kyūbi, they encounter Yomi and Izuna, now a corrupted soul like herself. During the battle the Black Priestess's Black Kirin (opposing the White Priestess's Byakuei, together they are yin & yang) breaks Byakuei's chains thus tearing apart both Byakuei and Kagura's souls. To save Kagura, Yomi melds with Kagura's soul after comprehending Kagura's devotion to her, as Byakuei dies. Izuna subsequently vanishes. Two years later, after the miasma clears and society rebuilds itself, Yomi, Kyouko, Kensuke, Kagura, and Izuna, a free-floating ghost, continue exorcism duties and live together, per Kensuke's suggestion. Mikado finally proposes to Tsuina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ga-Rei\" was published by Kadokawa Shoten in the shōnen magazine \"Shōnen Ace\" and was collected in twelve tankōbon volumes. In addition, a single volume side-story manga titled \"Ga-rei: Tsuina no Shō\" was also published by Kadokawa Shoten in the shōnen magazine \"Shōnen Ace\". In Europe, the series was licensed by Pika Édition for France, by Planet Manga for Italy and by Tokyopop for Germany. Kadokawa Shoten has then made the digital English version of the Manga available on BookWalker.\n\n\"Ga-Rei: Zero\" is directed by Ei Aoki and animated by AIC Spirits and asread. The show is aired on AT-X, Chiba TV, KBS Kyoto, Sun TV, Tokyo MX TV, TV Aichi, TV Hokkaido, TV Kanagawa, TV Saitama and TVQ Kyushu Broadcasting Co., Ltd.\n\nThe adaptation was announced on the promotional sleeve wrapper of \"Ga-rei\"'s sixth volume regarding the green lighting of the show. A \"Ga-Rei: Zero\" television ad was soon aired to promote the show's upcoming release, followed by 30 second commercials that were on the \"Ga-Rei: Zero\" websites. Originally, it was announced that the anime would be an original story, suggesting that it had nothing to do with the manga except its setting: however, after the first episode aired, viewers were confused as the entire cast was suddenly killed off. It was only later revealed in the second episode and still later in a radio interview with cast members Minoru Shiraishi, Kaoru Mizuhara & Minori Chihara, that the anime in fact tells the backstories of Yomi and Kagura before the events of the manga, thus making \"Ga-Rei: Zero\" a prequel to the original \"Ga-Rei\" series.\n\nFunimation Entertainment announced \"Ga-Rei: Zero\"s English license in August 2010 and released the series on Blu-ray and DVD in 2011. Funimation will stream the subtitled episodes on their video portal and YouTube channel.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter reported that Craig Kyle will adapt the manga into a live-action Hollywood TV series.\n\n"}
{"id": "34827386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34827386", "title": "Gilles (stock character)", "text": "Gilles (stock character)\n\nGilles ()—sometimes Gille—is a stock character of French farce and Commedia dell'Arte. He enjoyed his greatest vogue in 18th-century France, in entertainments both at the fairgrounds of the capital and in private and public theaters, though his origins can be traced back to the 17th century and, possibly, the century previous. A \"zanni\", or comic servant, he is a type of bungling clown, stupid, credulous, and lewd—a character that shares little, problematically, with the sensitive figure in Watteau's famous portrait that, until the latter half of the 20th century, bore his name alone. Gilles fades from view in the 19th century, to persist in the 20th and 21st as the Belgian Gilles of Binche Carnival.\n\nGilles' origins are obscure. There was a \"zanni\" Giglio in the Italian troupe of the academic \"Intronati\" as early as 1531, and some historians link him to Gilles. But no line of succession has been traced. The French expression \"faire gilles\", meaning \"to go bankrupt\" or \"to run away\", dates from the 16th century, and some dictionaries find a source for both the name and the character in the phrase, since \"the Gilles of the fair\", by their authority, \"is he who runs away when he is called.\"\n\nThe most likely origin of the name and type is the 17th-century Gilles le Niais (Gilles the Simpleton), a character who may or may not have known multiple incarnations. According to some lines in \"Les Véritables prétieuses\" (1660) by Antoine Baudeau de Somaize, Gilles le Niais was the creation of a single actor, the Sieur de la Force, said to have descended from a venerable line of French \"farceurs\", most immediately from . His small troupe performed, around 1646, farces that he himself composed, laced with songs that were popular among the idlers and \"flâneurs\" of the Pont-Neuf. His name appears among several of the Mazarinades following the uprising of the Fronde: \"Le Dialogue burlesque de Gilles le Niais et du capitan Spacamon\" (The Burlesque Dialogue between Gilles le Niais and Captain Spacamon, 1649), \"Les Entretiens sérieux de et de Gilles le Niais, rétourné de Flandres, sur le temps présent\" (The Serious Discussions of Jodelet with Gilles le Niais, back from Flanders, on the Present Times, 1649), and \"Le Véritable Gilles le Niais, en vers burlesques\" (The Real Gilles le Niais, in Burlesque Verse, n.d.).\n\nBut this claim of single parentage is weakened by Victor Fournel's admission that Gilles le Niais could have been \"a sobriquet of a type, applied to several personages\". What seems most clearly beyond dispute is that the copiously documented appearances of Gilles the comic servant at the Parisian fairs of the 18th century, the Foires Saint-Germain and Saint-Laurent, owed their origins to an actor-tumbler called Marc, who in 1697 first performed as Gilles at the popular Foire Saint-Germain.\n\nMarc's Gilles was followed in quick succession at the fairs by Gilles of other actors and acrobats: the tumblers Benville and Drouin, in the same year as Marc's debut; Crespin, called Gilles le Boiteux (Gilles the Gimp), \"a performer of 'grace and lightness' despite the infirmity of his body\", in 1701; Nicolas Maillot, \"one of the best Gilles to appear at the Foire\", in 1702; and Génois, a grimacing rope-dancer in wooden clogs, in 1711.\n\nGilles was sometimes given a major role in a \"regular\" comedy, such as \"La Conquête de la Toison d'or\" (The Conquest of the Golden Fleece, 1724) by Lesage and Dorneval. But he could be found more commonly at the fairgrounds (as the citations above suggest) at the acrobatic venues and, rather more revealingly, in the entertainments known as \"parades\". An outdoor performance, usually on a trestle-stage, that was contrived to lure spectators inside a theater, the \"parade\" was typically comprised, as William Driver Howarth notes, of five standard elements:\n\nThe focus here is upon that fool who feels the brunt of the mayhem: he was almost invariably Gilles. In 1756 a three-volume collection of \"parades\" was published anonymously as \"Théâtre des Boulevards\", and in its pages Gilles acquires a distinct sharpness of outline. Robert Storey traces it with trenchancy: \"A character of more simplicity than sense and of less decency than either, Gilles inherits the ignoble side of the \"commedia\"'s comic masks.\" His inventiveness rarely exceeds the strategem of \"Isabelle, Grosse par vertu\" (Isabelle, Knocked-up by Virtue), in which he advises his mistress to enlarge her belly with a hidden tureen, thereby convincing the amorous Doctor that he has been beaten to the erotic prize. When Arlequin, the first \"zanni\" (and his superior in every way), tells him that shit is fetching high prices on the market, he produces a large batch of it and peddles it through the streets (\"Who'd like some of my shit? ... it's nice and fresh\"—\"Le Marchand de Merde\": The Shit Merchant, scene X). Gilles's appetites are, in one of his chroniclers' words, \"prodigiously insatiable\", and his guardian spirits (\"Sainte Merde!\") are always provocatively profane. If his Italian predecessor, Pedrolino, \"often shares the ether with Ariel,\" as Storey writes, he himself \"tumbles, with Puck's witless companions, among the cornflowers.\"\n\nQuite early in the century, the \"parade\" acquired the status of what Howarth calls a \"cult entertainment\" among the leisured classes. Thomas-Simon Gueullette, a lawyer and \"friend of letters, of theater, and of pleasure\" (in the words of his biographer, J.-E. Gueullette), was so enamored of a \"parade\" he had seen one night around 1707 at the Foire Saint-Laurent that he and his friends performed it at a private soirée. It proved such a success that Gueullette formed a theater society, built a playhouse at Auteuil, and began receiving \"an astonishing concourse of spectators of the first rank\" to laugh at the ribaldry of Gilles. After he established other theaters at Maisons and Choisy, the \"parade\" \"very soon became \"à la mode\".\" Writers of ambition, such as Charles Collé and Barthélemy-Christophe Fagan, seized upon the entertainment and soon \"made it one of the favourite genres performed in the 'théâtres de société', or private playhouses, which were to blossom from about 1730 onwards in aristocratic \"châteaux\" and the townhouses of the capital.\" In the 1760s, the author of \"Le Mariage de Figaro\", Beaumarchais, set himself to writing \"parades\", most of which were probably performed in the private theater of his friend and patron, Charles-Guillaume Le Normant d'Etiolles, ex-husband of Madame de Pompadour. Even in a piece like \"Les Bottes de sept lieues\" (The Seven-League Boots), the \"least substantial\" of Beaumarchais' \"parades\", Gilles gives ample evidence of that winning credulity that \"makes him a ready victim for Arlequin's comic invention.\"\n\nGilles acquired a kind of respectability toward the end of the century, when he was adopted by the boulevard theaters that catered to the predominantly middle-class. We find his name among many of the comedies at the Théâtre de la Cité (1792–1807) and the Variétés Amusantes (1778–89, 1793–98).\n\nAs the famous portrait by Watteau attests (see inset), Gilles and Pierrot were often confused during this century. The scholar Ludovic Celler suggests that the actor Nicolas Maillot, who, as noted above, played Gilles from 1702, was responsible for the confusion: \"at first,\" Celler writes, Maillotplayed the roles of Pierrot under the pseudonym of Gilles: since he was talented and successful, his \"nom de guerre\" served to designate the employ. Hence was created the Gilles who took, as a result, a rather important place in the \"parades\" of the Boulevards and caused the French Pierrot to be almost completely forgotten ... Apparently, the confusion was abetted by the erosion of integrity of Pierrot's original character: Giuseppe Giaratone, who played Pierrot in the Comédie-Italienne of the previous century, had brought a rich and unifying consistency to the role. But as the Pierrots of the Foires began to multiply—among dancers, tumblers, and actors—and to accommodate themselves to the disparate Foire genres—puppet shows, comic operas, and every imaginable permutation of both mute and spoken theater—his character began inevitably to coarsen. It is therefore not surprising that Colombine should call Pierrot a \"Gille\" in Alexis Piron's \"L'Ane d'Or\" (The Golden Ass, 1725) or that a police report detailing the suspicious goings-on in Lesage's prologue to \"Arlequin, valet de Merlin\" (Harlequin, Merlin's Valet, 1718) should refer to Pierrot indiscriminately as \"Pierrot\" or as \"Gilles\". (It should also not be surprising that, when the illustrious Pierrot Hamoche was forbidden, in 1721, to play \"opéras-comiques\", impelling Lesage and Dorneval to lay his Pierrot to rest in \"Les Funérailles de la Foire\" [The Foire's Funeral, 1718], Gilles came bustling in in their subsequent play, \"Le Rappel de la Foire à la Vie\" [The Recall of the Foire to Life, 1721], to take his double's place. As late as the second decade of the 19th century, we find Pierrot's name changing inexplicably to \"Gilles\" in the middle of the script of a pantomime performed at the Théâtre des Funambules.) The two characters were often so much alike as to be virtually indistinguishable.\n\nAs Francis Haskell has pointed out (and the remarks above imply), not only did Gilles \"wear the same costume\" as Pierrot, but both generally \"had the same character\" throughout the 18th century: Pierrot, like Gilles, \"was a farcical creature, not a tragic or sensitive one\". (Pierrot will become tearful and incipiently tragic only in the middle of the 19th century, in the hands of Paul Legrand.) \"It is\", writes Haskell, \"hard to resist the conclusion that the consumptive Watteau has invested the figure of Gilles with some degree of self-identification, and Mrs. [Erwin] Panofsky has also pointed out that on many other occasions when painting Pierrot figures Watteau not only gave them a predominance which was absolutely not justified by the nature of the parts they were called upon to act, but may even have hinted at something Christ-like in their role.\" As Haskell seems to be implying, there may be at least as much Watteau as either Gilles or Pierrot in the portrait.\n\nIf it was Maillot who \"caused the French Pierrot to be almost completely forgotten\", it was the Pierrot of the great mime Deburau who turned the tables on Gilles in the early 19th century. Partly because of Deburau's dominance in both the theatrical and literary imaginations of French enthusiasts of the Commedia dell'Arte, Gilles faded from view in that century, appearing occasionally in a vaudeville like \"Gilles en deuil de lui-même\" (Gilles in Mourning for Himself, 1847) at the Théâtre de la Rue de Chartres or a farce like Mélésville's \"Les Deux Gilles\" (The Two Gilles, 1855) at the Folies-Nouvelles. At the end of the century, he makes a brief spectral appearance in Albert Giraud's \"Pierrot lunaire\" (overlooked in Arnold Schoenberg's selective immortalizing of that work). In the 20th century and later in the 21st, he survives most robustly at the Binche Carnival in Belgium—though a redoubtable student of that carnival insists that its many Gilles share with the \"zanni\" of the French fairgrounds only one thing: his name.\n\n\n"}

It is bounded on the north by Bhutan, on the east by the Kamrup region, in the south by Meghalaya and in the west by Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri in West Bengal and Rangpur in Bangladesh. The natural landmarks are: Sankosh and Brahmaputra rivers on the west, the Manas river on the east in the north bank, and a corresponding region in the south bank; the Garo Hills in the south and Bhutan Hills in the north.\n\nIn ancient times, it was part of Ratnapith, a division of the Kamarupa kingdom. After the fall of the Kamarupa dynasties Sandhya, a later Kamarupa king, moved his capital from Kamarupanagara (present-day Guwahati) to Kamatapur (near Cooch Behar town) in the middle of the 13th century, and established the Kamata kingdom. This situation prevailed till the time of Naranarayana, when it became a part of Koch Hajo. It was defined as an administrative unit for the first time in the 17th century when it was called \"Sarkar Dhekuri\" under the Bengal Subah of the Mughals. After the transfer of the Bengal \"Diwani\" to the East India Company, the Goalpara region, minus the Assam Dooars, then under Bhutan, came to be called Rangamatty, and after 1816, \"Northeast Rangpur\". When the British constituted this as a district in 1833 it came to be known after its headquarters which was in Goalpara town. A portion of the Assam Dooars areas were added to this district after the Bhutan war of 1865.\n\nA majority of the people belong to the Rajbongshi speaking Koch-Rajbongshi community, who are converts from Mech, Rabha, Keot/Kaibarta and Kachari communities in earlier times. Goalpariya dialect spoken here is a part of Rajbongshi which is a constituent of the Bengali-Assamese linguistic group. Assamese Brahmins and Kayastha communities are small, and even the Kalitas, who have a dominating presence in the adjoining Kamrup region, are not as significant.\n\nThe Bodos form a strong presence in the region. Traditionally, they are called Kacharis in the south and in the rest of Assam, but called Mech in the north bank of the Brahmaputra river and the whole of North Bengal. Their strongest presence is in the present Kokrajhar district in the north bank. The Rabhas, who along with the Bodos, are a semi-Hinduized group concentrated in the south bank. The Garos and the Hajongs too are not insignificant in the south.\n\nThe Muslim population, which is not insignificant, a distinction is made between the local (\"deshi\") communities that are descendants of early settlers, and non-local (\"bhatiya\") who have immigrated in recent times from downstream East Bengal.\n\n"}
{"id": "35349024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35349024", "title": "Heathen Gods in Old English Literature", "text": "Heathen Gods in Old English Literature\n\nHeathen Gods in Old English Literature is a historical study of the literary references for several pagan deities in Anglo-Saxon England. Written by the English studies scholar Richard North of University College London, it was first published by Cambridge University Press in 1997. The book was released as the twenty-second monograph in the Press' series, \"Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England\", edited by Simon Keynes, Michael Lapidge and Andy Orchard. Prior to the book's publication, North had previously authored other studies of Anglo-Saxon paganism, such as \"Pagan Words and Christian Meanings\" (1991).\n\n\"Heathen Gods in Old English Literature\" details North's theory that the god Ing played a prominent role in the pre-Christian religion of Anglo-Saxon England, and highlights references to him in such texts as \"Beowulf\" and the sole surviving Anglo-Saxon copy of the \"Book of Exodus\".\n\nThe book received a mixed reviewed in peer reviewed journals such as \"The Modern Language Review\". Critics argued that North's interpretations of the evidence were too speculative.\n\nIn the opening chapter, entitled \"Nerthus and Terra Mater: Anglian religion in the first century\", North begins by describing the approach that he has taken in this particular study of Anglo-Saxon paganism. Highlighting how little information regarding pre-Christian beliefs was recorded in the surviving Old English literature, all of which was produced in the Christian period, he argues that scholars must approach the subject by looking at the literary evidence produced by related Germanic-language societies elsewhere in Europe. He argues that by studying both the 1st-century accounts of Tacitus regarding religion in continental Germania and the Late Medieval accounts from Iceland and Scandinavia, scholars can shed further light on lost aspects of Anglo-Saxon heathenism.\n\nChapter two, \"Ingui of Bernicia\" looks at the concept of an Anglo-Saxon god named Ing. He discusses the existence of the \"Ingvaeones\", a tribe in first-century Germania, arguing that they may have been devoted to Ing. Drawing comparisons from the cult of Dionysus in the Classical world, North argues that \"\"Ing-\" was first a functional term for a human embodiment of Nerthus, then for a man representing Nerthus.\" Proceeding to discuss the role of the Vanir in Norse mythology, he deals with Ingvi-Freyr of Uppsala in Sweden and then Ingui of Bernicia in Northern England, ultimately concluding that in early Anglo-Saxon history, a deity named Ingui was believed to be the progenitor of Anglian kings.\n\nThe third chapter is entitled \"Ingui's cult remembered: Ing and the \"ingefolc\"\" and deals with the literary evidence for a figure called Ing in Anglo-Saxon England.\n\nNorth spends much of his book devoted to the argument that there was a god known as \"Ing\" in Anglo-Saxon England. He highlights the fact that this \"Ing\"-hypostasis appears in various different contexts within Germanic-speaking Europe; it appears in the name of the Ingvaeones, a tribal grouping referred to in Tacitus' \"Germania\", while in the later records of Norse mythology, the son of the god Njǫrð is known as Ignvi-freyr.\n\nFrom an examination of Tacitus' account, North argues that the Ingvaeone tribe would have worshiped the deity Nerthus, whom Tacitus described as an earth goddess. Although Tacitus never explicitly stated that the Ingvaeone worshiped Nerthus, North considers it likely because they lived \"proximi Oceano\", near the sea, while Tacitus located the temple of Nerthus \"in insula Oceani\", within the land of the Suebi tribe; North believes that these are sufficiently close to one another that they would have worshiped the same deity. North translates \"Ingvaeone\" as meaning \"friends of Ing-\".\n\nNorth's work was reviewed by T.A. Shippey of Saint Louis University for \"The Modern Language Review\". Taking a critical approach to the book, Shippey was of the opinion that the author's arguments relied \"very heavily on assumptions about the precise (one might say gnostic) meanings of sometimes rather common words.\" He argues that many will not accept some of North's \"more complex arguments\" and that North's interpretation of \"Deor\", 11. 14-6, via \"Hdvamdl\", stanzas 96-102 as a political satire on \nÆthelwulf of Wessex was \"especially strained\". However, on a more positive note Shippey accepted the \"intrinsic plausibility\" of North's presentation of Anglo-Saxon paganism as a \"natural religion\" which posed little threat or opposition to the incoming Christianity.\n\nIn his book, \"The Elder Gods: The Otherworld of Early England\" (2011), the English Anglo-Saxonist Stephen Pollington noted that North's book had been criticised for being \"too free\" in the interpretation of sources, but felt that it nonetheless \"relieved the researcher from the emasculating fear of making an assumption or two and testing them against the evidence.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "29722995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29722995", "title": "Hierotopy", "text": "Hierotopy\n\nHierotopy (from , sacred + , place, space) is the creation of sacred spaces viewed as a special form of human creativity and also a related academic field where specific examples of such creativity are studied. The concept and the term were developed in 2002 by Russian art-historian and byzantinist Alexei Lidov. Hierotopy accounts for the ways in which a vast array of media (e.g. religious images, ritual, song, incense, light) are used to organize sacred spaces. As an academic field, it spans the disciplines of art history, archeology, cultural anthropology, ethnology and religious studies, but it possesses an object of study and a methodology of its own. It differs from the phenomenology of the sacred (which has been studied by Mircea Eliade, Rudolf Otto and Pavel Florensky) insofar as it focuses on historical examples of hierotopic projects, that is, projects establishing a medium of communication between the mundane and the sacred. Though related with religious mysticism, hierotopy deals first and foremost with forms of conscious, creative activity. \n\nAccording to the hierotopic approach, icons and other sacred artifacts are viewed not as isolated objects, but as components of larger hierotopic projects. Though such artifacts often play a prominent role in hierotopic studies, it is these projects themselves – including both their conceptual and artistic aspects, as well as the historical developments leading to their formation – that are the primary focus of study. The role played by the creators of sacred spaces is also of chief importance, and could be compared with that of an artist. The creative element at work here resembles the work of contemporary film directors, for both involve the coordinated effort of various artists and specialists in shaping a single, comprehensive vision. As examples of hierotopic projects, one can consider King Solomon's construction of the First Temple, the erection of Hagia Sophia by Emperor Justinian, as well as the work of Abbot Suger in the conception of first Gothic cathedrals. Hierotopic projects are not limited to churches and sanctuaries; in other cases, landscapes, architectural compounds and even cities and countries have become products of hierotopic creativity. \n\nThe topics of hierotopic study cover a broad span of interests and range, for example, from the role played by light in church architecture to the study of religious ceremonies, feasts and folk customs. The comparison of hierotopic models at work in different cultures is another focus of interest. \n\nSix international symposia (2004, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2014, 2017) have been organized on hierotopic subjects.\n\nThe concept of the \"spatial icon\" plays a central role in hierotopy and is used to describe the perception of sacred spaces. Spatial icons are understood to play a mediating role between the mundane and the sacred. They are mediatory images that are evoked, for example, in the space of a temple or sanctuary. Hierotopic creativity is a sort of art, which can be described as the creation of spatial icons. This concept applies to the way in which the perception of architecture, light, image, ritual practice, as well as various other components forming sacred spaces, is unified into a single vision. It is also used in the study both of \"sacred landscapes\", such as the New Jerusalem Monastery near Moscow, as well as of various ritual practices creating iconic medium, such as the Donkey walk in medieval Moscow. Spatial icons are essentially dynamic and performative in nature, such that the formal boundary between ‘image’ and ‘beholder’ no longer pertains. Typically, the beholders of spatial icons are actively involved in some way and become, to a certain extent, co-creators of the icons.\n\nThe transfer of sacred spaces is an important form of hierotopic creativity. While an original sacred space often appears as the result of a theophany, such as a divine visitation or omen, this primary sacred space is then consciously reproduced in sanctuaries or temples as a spatial icon. For example, the construction of the First Temple, as recounted in the Old Testament, can be viewed as the reproduction of the sacred space of the Tabernacle. Similarly, in the design and construction of many Christian churches, the First Temple itself has been taken as a hierotopic prototype. Multiple \"New Jerusalems\" (reproductions of the Holy City of Jerusalem), aimed to establish a link to the space of the Holy Land, are common both to the Eastern and Western branches of the Christian tradition.\n\nThe perception of sacred spaces has been analyzed by Lidov in terms of \"image-paradigms\". According to his conception, an image-paradigm is a guiding image-vision that is created with the help of various media and that is aimed at evoking the same image in the mind of beholders of a sacred space. An image-paradigm, which is essentially different from an illustrative picture or representation, is a means of communication between the creators of sacred spaces and their beholders. It constitutes a kernel of meaning that gives form to an entire hierotopic project. As an example, the image of the Heavenly Jerusalem, which was present in Medieval churches without being directly represented, is one of the most significant image-paradigms in the Christian tradition.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1062194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1062194", "title": "Hungarian phonology", "text": "Hungarian phonology\n\nThe phonology of the Hungarian language is notable for its process of vowel harmony, the frequent occurrence of geminate consonants and the presence of otherwise uncommon palatal stops.\n\nThis is the Hungarian consonantal system, using symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).\n\n\nAlmost every consonant may be geminated, written by doubling a single letter grapheme: for , for , for etc., or by doubling the first letter of a grapheme cluster: for , for , etc.\n\nThe phonemes and can appear on the surface as geminates: \"bridzs\" ('bridge'). (For the list of examples and exceptions, see Hungarian dz and dzs.)\n\nHungarian orthography, unlike that of the surrounding Slavic languages, does not use \"háčky\" or any other consonant diacritics. Instead, the letters \"c, s, z\" are used alone (, , ) or combined in the digraphs \"cs, sz, zs\" (, , ), while \"y\" is used only in the digraphs \"ty, gy, ly, ny\" as a palatalization marker to write the sounds , , (formerly ), .\n\nThe most distinctive allophones are:\n\nHungarian has seven pairs of corresponding short and long vowels. Their \"phonetic\" values do not exactly match up with each other, so represents and represents ; likewise, represents while represents . For the other pairs, the short vowels are slightly lower and more central, and the long vowels more peripheral:\n\nThe sound marked by is considered to be by Tamás Szende and by Mária Gósy. Gósy also mentions a different short that contrasts with both and , present in a few words like \"Svájc\" ('Switzerland'), \"svá ('schwa'), advent\" ('advent'), \"hardver\" ('hardware', this usage is considered hyperforeign), and \"halló\" (used when answering the phone; contrasting with \"haló\" 'dying', and \"háló\" 'web').\n\nThere are two more marginal sounds, namely the long as well as the long . They are used in the name of the letters \"E\" and \"A\", which are pronounced and , respectively.\n\nAlthough not found in Budapest, some dialects contrast three mid vowels (written in some works, but not in the standard orthography), , and . Thus \"mentek\" could represent four different words: \"mëntëk\" ('you all go'), \"mëntek\" ('they went'), \"mentëk\" ('I save'), and \"mentek\" ('they are exempt'). In Budapest, the first three collapse to , while the latter one is unknown, having a different form in the literary language (\"mentesek\").\n\nAs in Finnish, Turkish, and Mongolian, vowel harmony plays an important part in determining the distribution of vowels in a word. Hungarian vowel harmony classifies the vowels according to front vs. back assonance and rounded vs unrounded for the front vowels. Excluding recent loanwords, Hungarian words have either only back vowels or front vowels due to these vowel harmony rules.\n\nWhile , , , and are all front unrounded vowels, they are considered to be \"neutral vowels\" in Hungarian vowel harmony. Therefore, if a word contains back vowels, neutral vowels may appear alongside them. However, if only neutral vowels appear in a stem, the stem is treated as though it is of front vowel assonance and all suffixes must contain front vowels.\n\nVowel harmony in Hungarian is most notable when observing suffixation. Vowel harmony must be maintained throughout the entire word, meaning that most suffixes have variants. For example, the dative case marker vs. . Stems that contain back vowels affix back vowel suffixes, and stems that contain only front vowels affix front vowel suffixes. However, the front vowel stems distinguish rounded vs. unroundedness based on the last vowel in the stem. If the last vowel is front and rounded, it takes a suffix with a front rounded vowel; otherwise it follows the standard rules. While suffixes for most words have front/back vowel variants, there are not many that have rounded/unrounded variants, indicating that this is a rarer occurrence.\n\nOne is able to observe the distinction when looking at the plural affix, either (back), (front unrounded), or (front rounded).\n\nAs can be seen above, the neutral vowels are able to be in both front and back vowel assonance words with no consequence.\n\nHowever, there are about fifty monosyllabic roots that only contain , , or that all take a back vowel suffix instead of the front vowel suffix.\n\nThese exceptions to the rule are hypothesized to have originated from the roots originally having contained a phoneme no longer present in modern Hungarian, the unrounded back vowel , or its long counterpart . It is theorized that while these vowels merged with or , less commonly or , the vowel harmony rules sensitive to the backness of the original sound remained in place. The theory finds support from etymology: related words in other languages generally have back vowels, often specifically unrounded back vowels. For example, \"nyíl\" 'arrow' (plural \"nyíl-ak\") corresponds to Komi ньыл , Southern Mansi .\n\nThe overall characteristics of the consonant assimilation in Hungarian are the following:\n\n\nIn a cluster of consonants ending in an obstruent, all obstruents change their voicing according to the last one of the sequence. The affected obstruents are the following:\n\n\n\nNasals assimilate to the place of articulation of the following consonant (even across word boundaries):\n\nCombination of a \"palatalizable\" consonant and a following palatal consonant results in a palatal geminate. Palatalizable consonants are palatal ones and their non-palatal counterparts: \"gy\" ~ \"d\" , \"l\" ~ \"ly\" , \"n\" ~ \"ny\" , \"ty\" ~ \"t\" .\nLong consonants become short when preceded or followed by another consonant, e.g. \"folttal\" 'by/with (a) patch', \"varrtam\" 'I sewed'.\n\nThe middle alveolar stops may be omitted in clusters with more than two consonants, depending on speed and articulation of speech: \"azt hiszem\" ~ 'I presume/guess', \"mindnyájan\" 'one and all', \"különbség\" ~ 'difference'. In morpheme onsets like \"str-\" , middle stops tends to be more stable in educated speech, \"falanxstratégia\" ~ ~ 'strategy based on phalanxes'.\n\n\n also tends to be omitted between a preceding vowel and an adjacent stop or affricate rapid speech, causing the lengthening of the vowel or diphthongization (e.g. \"volt\" 'was', \"polgár\" 'citizen'). This is considered non-standard.\n\nStandard Hungarian prefers hiatus between adjacent vowels. However some optional dissolving features can be observed:\n\nThe stress is on the first syllable of the word. The articles \"a\", \"az\", \"egy\", and the particle \"is\" are usually unstressed.\n\n"}

The group is thought to contain as many as 100,000 species, many of which have not yet been described. Like other parasitoid wasps, they were long placed in the \"Parasitica\", variously considered as an infraorder or an unranked clade, now known to be paraphyletic.\n\nThe name is derived from Latin 'ichneumon', from Ancient Greek ἰχνεύμων (ikhneúmōn, \"tracker\"), from ἴχνος (íkhnos, \"track, footstep\"). The name is shared with the Egyptian mongoose, \"Herpestes ichneumon\".\n\nThe superfamily is defined by fusion of the costal and radial veins of the fore wing, and almost all species have more than 11 antennal segments. Both included families have a cosmopolitan distribution. Ichneumonoids have morphological similarities with relatives within the order Hymenoptera, including ants and bees. Ichneumonoidea contains a great deal of morphological diversity, with species ranging in size from long. Most are slender, and the females of many species (particularly in the genus \"Megarhyssa\") have extremely long ovipositors for laying eggs.\n\nThe ichneumonid wasps may be more familiar to non-entomologists than braconids, as they are generally larger. The two families are distinguished from each other primarily by details of wing venation.\n\nMost are brownish or black, not brightly colored. Fore wings lack vein 2m-cu.\n\nIchneumonids vary greatly in size and their color varies from brightly colored yellow to uniform black. Fore wing with vein 2m-cu present and tubular.\n\nParasitoidism evolved only once in the Hymenoptera, during the Permian, leading to a single clade, the Apocrita. The Apocrita emerged during the Jurassic.\n\nIchneumonoids are solitary insects, and the vast majority are parasitoids; the larvae feed on or in another insect until it finally dies. Most hosts are holometabolus insect larvae, but there are many exceptions. In general, ichneumonoids are host specific, and only attack one or a few closely related host species. Many species use polydnaviruses to suppress the immune systems of their host insects. Due to the wide variety in hosts and lifestyles, see subfamily pages for more detail.\n\nThe female ichneumonoid finds a host and lays an egg on, near, or inside the host's body. The ovipositor of ichneumonoids generally cannot deliver a sting as many wasps or bees do. It can be used to bore wood and lay eggs on hosts deep inside, or reach hosts hidden inside leaf shelters. Upon hatching, the larva feeds either externally or internally, killing the host when it is ready to pupate.\n\nVarious ichneumonoids are used as biological control agents in controlling horticultural or forest pests. An example is the relationship between the species \"Ichneumon eumerus\" and its host butterfly \"Phengaris rebeli\". The butterfly larva is a parasite within \"Myrmica\" ant nests. The adult \"I. eumerus\" searches for ant nests and only enters when they contain \"P. rebeli\" caterpillars. Once inside, they oviposit their eggs within the caterpillars and escape the nest by releasing a chemical which causes the worker ants to fight each other rather than the intruding wasp. The wasp eggs then hatch inside the caterpillar and eventually consume and kill the host.\n\n"}

The collection of Australian Aboriginal artifacts from the local area and western Queensland, some of which are extremely rare, has national historic significance by its association with Australia's indigenous peoples.\n\nThe Barunggam clan lived in the area from Tchanning Creek near Yuleba on the west, to Myall Creek near Dalby on the east, north to the Great Dividing Range, and south to the Moonie and Condamine watersheds. There are no known descendents in the area today, as the Barunggam were moved to Taroom in 1916, and then eventually to Cherbourg or Woorabinda.\n\nOn the sandstone slabs that abound on the banks of L Tree Creek north of Miles, grooves in the stone are clear evidence that they were popular spear sharpening spots. There were places on Dogwood Creek and Chinaman's Lagoon (about 1 km south of Miles) where the aborigines stopped and ate, and there are old middens of mussel shells on the west bank of the river at Condamine, and at the Round Waterhole north of Dulacca.\n\nThe region was also a transition stop for other aboriginal tribes as they travelled through every three years until 1876 on their way to the Bunya Mountains for the ripening of the bunya nuts. The Village collection includes the 'Ilbalunga Cave' as an example of a transition stop. Local aboriginal people were involved in its creation and decorated the cave with their hand prints.\n\nThe collection also includes a map showing the tribal areas, an extensive assortment of rubbing stones, boomerangs, stone axes, grinding and milling stones and other tools, predominantly from two major donors – the Keenan and the Mayfield families as well as dilly bags and other handcrafted items. Of particular significance are a Koala skin rug, an original Notice regarding the Aboriginal Protection Act, and a chest plate which are detailed below.\n\nAs few rugs of aboriginal origin are in existence today, this koala skin rug is rare and of great historical significance as a handcrafted aboriginal artefact. It may also be useful for researching sewing and rug construction techniques. The rug was found in a cave on Mt Moffatt Station, near Roma, by Mr Dayne Vincent. The twine is made of boodioorie bark and the stitching is particularly unusual. The rug would have provided warmth and comfort due to the thick and soft nature of the koala fur.\n\nOther koala skin rugs exist in Australian Museums, however they are not of aboriginal manufacture but made after British colonisation when native furs were used in Australia for clothing and other wares. Millions of koalas were killed for their pelts up until the 1930s when protective measures were implemented by State governments to rebuild their numbers and stop the fur trade. Today koala is protected by legislation in all States and Territories where they are found.\n\nThis notice came from Taroom where it had been displayed in the old Police Station for over 50 years, probably since 1897. The Notice is written in English and Chinese, and could be very rare as there are no other known copies.\n\nEleven of the 32 sections dealt stringently with control of the supply of opium to Aboriginal people. However the Act had wider social significance as its practical outcome was oppressive and restricted the rights and freedoms of Aboriginal people.\n\nThe legislation established reserves – geographically isolated enclaves – to which Aboriginal people could be forcibly removed by designated 'Aboriginal Protectors' – civil servants, police and missionaries. People were restricted to these reserves ostensibly to protect them from the ravages of European immorality and disease. Furthermore, the legislation was used to control Aboriginal people at the workplace and to remove their basic civil rights, reducing them to the position of State wards. This Act was not overturned until the Community Services Act 1984.\n\nKing plates were a form of regalia used in pre-Federation Australia by white colonial authorities to recognise local Aboriginal leaders. This chest plate belonged to a chief of the Palparara tribe of western Queensland in the Winton – Windorah area, near Julia Creek.\n\nKing plates were metallic crescent-shaped plaques worn around the neck which sat across the chest. This chest plate belonged to King Dick of Boondie. A 'boondie' is an Australian term for a sand cake that is carved from, or broken off, a larger, hardened pocket of sand and can be thrown like a snow ball. Boondies are common in Western Queensland.\n\nKnown 'Kings' of the Miles district were King Billy of Tiereyboo who came in to live at Chinaman's Lagoon (near Miles) in the early 1900s, and King Sandy of Moraby. Tiereyboo was one of the early holdings taken up in this area, and was situated between the Condamine River and Dogwood Creek, and Moraby was an adjoining early holding further west.\n\n"}
{"id": "263104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263104", "title": "Instructional scaffolding", "text": "Instructional scaffolding\n\nInstructional scaffolding is the support given during the learning process which is tailored to the needs of the student with the intention of helping the student achieve his/her learning goals This learning process is designed to promote a deeper level of learning.\n\nInstructional scaffolding provides sufficient support to promote learning when concepts and skills are being first introduced to students. These supports may include resource, compelling task, templates and guides, and/or guidance on the development of cognitive and social skills. Instructional scaffolding could be employed through modeling a task, giving advice, and/or providing coaching.\n\nThese supports are gradually removed as students develop learning strategies, thus promoting their own cognitive, affective and psychomotor learning skills and knowledge. Teachers help the students master a task or a concept by providing support. The support can take many forms such as outlines, recommended documents, storyboards, or key questions.\n\nThere are three essential features of scaffolding that facilitate learning. The first feature has to do with the interaction between the learner and the expert. This interaction should be collaborative for it to be effective. The second, learning should take place in the learner's zone of proximal development. To do that the expert needs to be aware of the learner's current level of knowledge and then work to a certain extent beyond that level. The third feature of scaffolding is that the scaffold, the support and guidance provided by the expert, is gradually removed as the learner becomes more proficient. The support and guidance provided to the learner is compared to the scaffolds in building construction where the scaffolds provide both \"adjustable and temporal\" support to the building under construction. The support and guidance provided to learners facilitate internalization of the knowledge needed to complete the task. This support is weaned gradually until the learner is independent.\n\nFor scaffolding to be effective teachers need to pay attention to the following: \n\n\"Scaffolding theory\" was first introduced in the late 1950s by Jerome Bruner,a cognitive psychologist. He used the term to describe young children's oral language acquisition. Helped by their parents when they first start learning to speak, young children are provided with informal instructional formats within which their learning is facilitated. A scaffolding format investigated by Bruner and his postdoctoral student Anat Ninio whose scaffolding processes are described in detail is joint picture-book reading (Ninio & Bruner, 1978). By contrast, bed-time stories and read alouds are examples of book-centered parenting events (Daniels, 1994) without scaffolding interaction. Scaffolding is inspired by Lev Vygotsky's concept of an expert assisting a novice, or an apprentice. Scaffolding is changing the level of support to suit the cognitive potential of the child. Over the course of a teaching session, one can adjust the amount of guidance to fit the child's potential level of performance. More support is offered when a child is having difficulty with a particular task and, over time, less support is provided as the child makes gains on the task. Ideally, scaffolding works to maintain the child's potential level of development in the ZPD. An essential element to the ZPD and scaffolding is the acquisition of language. According to Vygotsky, language (and in particular, speech) is fundamental to children's cognitive growth because language provides purpose and intention so that behaviors can be better understood. Through the use of speech, children are able to communicate to and learn from others through dialogue, which is an important tool in the ZPD. In a dialogue, a child's unsystematic, disorganized, and spontaneous concepts are met with the more systematic, logical and rational concepts of the skilled helper. Empirical research suggests that the benefits of scaffolding are not only useful during a task, but can extend beyond the immediate situation in order to influence future cognitive development. For instance, a recent study recorded verbal scaffolding between mothers and their 3- and 4-year-old children as they played together. Then, when the children were six years old, they underwent several measures of executive function, such as working memory and goal-directed play. The study found that the children's working memory and language skills at six years of age were related to the amount of verbal scaffolding provided by mothers at age three. In particular, scaffolding was most effective when mothers provided explicit conceptual links during play. Therefore, the results of this study not only suggest that verbal scaffolding aids children's cognitive development, but that the quality of the scaffolding is also important for learning and development.\n\nA construct that is critical for scaffolding instruction is Vygotsky's concept of the zone of proximal development (ZPD). Zone of proximal development is that field between what a learner can do by himself (expert stage) and what can be achieved with the support of a knowledgeable peer or instructor (pedagogical stage) (Ellis & Worthington, 1994). Vygotsky was convinced that a child could be taught any subject efficiently using scaffolding practices by implementing the scaffolds at the Zone of proximal development. Students are escorted and monitored through learning activities that function as interactive conduits to get them to the next stage. Thus the learner obtains or raises new understandings by presenting on their prior knowledge through the support delivered by more capable individuals (Raymond, 2000). Several peer reviewed studies have shown that when there is a deficiency in guided learning experiences and social interaction, learning and development are obstructed (Bransford, Brown, and Cocking, 2000).\n\nIn writing instruction, typically support is presented in verbal form (discourse). The writing tutor engages the learner's attention, calibrates the task, motivates the student, identifies relevant task features, controls for frustration, and demonstrates as needed (Rodgers, 2004). Through joint activities, the teacher scaffolds conversation to maximize the development of a child's intrapsychological functioning. In this process, the adult controls the elements of the task that are beyond the child's ability all the while increasing the expectations of what the child is able to do. Speech, a critical tool to scaffold thinking and responding, plays a crucial role in the development of higher psychological processes (Luria, 1979) because it enables thinking to be more abstract, flexible, and independent (Bodrova & Leong, 1996). From a Vygotskian perspective, talk and action work together with the sociocultural fabric of the writing event to shape a child's construction of awareness and performance (Dorn, 1996). Dialogue may range from casual talk to deliberate explanations about features of written language. The talk embedded in the actions of the literacy event shapes the child's learning as the tutor regulates his or her language to conform to the child's degrees of understanding. Clay (2005) shows that what may seem like casual conversational exchanges between tutor and student actually offer many opportunities for fostering cognitive development, language learning, story composition for writing, and reading comprehension. Conversations facilitate generative, constructive, experimental, and developmental speech and writing in the development of new ideas (Smagorinsky, 2007).\n\nIn Vygotsky's words, \"what the child is able to do in collaboration today he will be able to do independently tomorrow\" (Vygotsky, 1987, p. 211).\n\nSome ingredients of scaffolding are predictability, playfulness, focus on meaning, role reversal, modeling, and nomenclature.\n\nAccording to Saye and Brush, there are two levels of scaffolding: soft and hard (2002). An example of soft scaffolding in the classroom would be when a teacher circulates the room and converses with his or her students (Simon and Klein, 2007). The teacher may question their approach to a difficult problem and provide constructive feedback. According to Van Lier, this type of scaffolding can also be referred to as contingent scaffolding. The type and amount of support needed is dependent on the needs of the students during the time of instruction (Van Lier, 1996). Unfortunately, applying scaffolding correctly and consistently can be difficult when the classroom is large and students have various needs (Gallagher, 1997). Scaffolding can be applied to a majority of the students, but the teacher is left with the responsibility to identify additional scaffolding.\n\nIn contrast with contingent or soft scaffolding, embedded or hard scaffolding is planned in advance to help students with a learning task that is known in advance to be difficult (Saye and Brush, 2002). For example, when students are discovering the formula for the Pythagorean Theorem in math class, the teacher may identify hints or cues to help the student reach an even higher level of thinking. In both situations, the idea of \"expert scaffolding\" is being implemented (Holton and Clarke, 2006): the teacher in the classroom is considered the expert and is responsible for providing scaffolding for the students.\n\nReciprocal scaffolding, a method first coined by Holton and Thomas, is a method that involves a group of two or more collaboratively working together. In this situation, the group can learn from each other's experiences and knowledge. The scaffolding is shared by each member and changes constantly as the group works on a task (Holton and Clarke, 2006). According to Vygotsky, students develop higher-level thinking skills when scaffolding occurs with an adult expert or with a peer of higher capabilities (Stone, 1998). Conversely, Piaget believes that students discard their ideas when paired with an adult or student of more expertise (Piaget, 1928). Instead, students should be paired with others who have different perspectives. Conflicts would then take place between students allowing them to think constructively at a higher level.\n\nTechnical scaffolding is a newer approach in which computers replace the teachers as the experts or guides, and students can be guided with web links, online tutorials, or help pages (Yelland and Masters, 2007). Educational software can help students follow a clear structure and allows students to plan properly (Lai and Law, 2006).\n\nSilliman and Wilkinson (1994) distinguish two types of scaffolding: 'supportive scaffolding' that characterises the IRF (Initiation-Response-Follow-up) pattern; and 'directive scaffolding' that refers to IRE (Initiation-Response-Evaluation). Saxena (2010) develops these two notions theoretically by incorporating Bhaktin's (1981) and vanLier's (1996) works. Within the IRE pattern, teachers provide 'directive scaffolding' on the assumption that their job is to transmit knowledge and then assess its appropriation by the learners. The question-answer-evaluation sequence creates a predetermined standard for acceptable participation and induces passive learning. In this type of interaction, the teacher holds the right to evaluate and asks 'known-information' questions which emphasise the reproduction of information. The nature and role of the triadic dialogue have been oversimplified and the potential for the roles of teachers and students in them has been undermined (Nassaji and Wells, 2000).\n\nIf, in managing the talk, teachers apply 'constructive power' (Saxena, 2009) and exploit students' responses as occasions for joint exploration, rather than simply evaluating them, then the classroom talk becomes dialogic (Nystrand, 1997). The pedagogic orientation of this talk becomes 'participation orientation', in contrast to 'display/assessment orientation' of IRE (van Lier, 1996). In this kind of pattern of interaction, the third part of the triadic dialogue offers 'follow-up' and teachers' scaffolding becomes 'supportive'. Rather than producing 'authoritative discourse' Bakhtin's (1981), teachers constructs 'internally persuasive discourse' that allows 'equality' and 'symmetry' (van Lier, 1996:175), wherein the issues of power, control, institutional managerial positioning, etc. are diffused or suspended. The discourse opens up the roles for students as the 'primary knower' and the 'sequence initiator' (Nassaji and Wells, 2000), which allows them to be the negotiator and co-constructor of meaning. The suspension of asymmetry in the talk represents a shift in the teacher's ideological stance and, therefore, demonstrates that supportive scaffolding is more than simply a model of instruction (Saxena, 2010: 167).\n\nLearner support in scaffolding is known as guidance. While it takes on various forms and styles, the base of guidance is any type of interaction from the instructor that is intended to aid and/or improve student learning. While this a broad definition, the role and amount of guidance is better defined by the instructor's approach. Instructionists and constructionists approach giving guidance within their own instructional frameworks. Scaffolding involves presenting learners with proper guidance that moves them towards their learning goals. Providing guidance is a method of moderating the cognitive load of a learner. In scaffolding, learners can only be moved toward their learning goals if cognitive load is held in check by properly administered support.\n\nInstructionists tend to give a higher level of guidance in light of the inquiry driven style of learning. With each piece of a complex task being broken down, instructors give guidance for each of the separated parts of the learning. In this way, higher guidance is a function of reducing cognitive load when students are working in a more individual manner.\n\nConstructivists approach guidance differently as a result of their focus on transfer. The concept of transfer focuses on a learner's ability to apply learned tasks in a context other than the modality in which it was learned. This results in constructivists giving a lower level of guidance, as learners work through a complete task, only being given guidance in transfer. The role of guidance is to ensure that cognitive load is moderated while the learner works at more complete and complex task; guidance is given during aspects of the task that will help enable transfer.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that higher level of guidance has a greater effect on scaffolded learning, but is not a guarantee of more learning. The efficacy of higher amount of guidance is dependent on the level of detail and guidance applicability. Having multiple types of guidance (i.e. worked examples, feedback) can cause them to interact and reinforce each other. Multiple conditions do not guarantee greater learning, as certain types of guidance can be extraneous to the learning goals or the modality of learning. With this, more guidance (if not appropriate to the learning) can negatively impact performance, as it gives the learner overwhelming levels of information. However, appropriately designed high levels of guidance, which properly interact with the learning, is more beneficial to learning than low levels of guidance.\n\nConstructivists pay close attention to the context of guidance, because they believe instruction plays a major role in knowledge retention and transfer. Research studies demonstrate how the context of isolated explanations can have an effect on student-learning outcomes. For example, Hake's (1998) large-scale study demonstrated how post-secondary physics students recalled less than 30% of material covered in a traditional lecture-style class. Similarly, other studies illustrate how students construct different understandings from explanation in isolation versus having a first experience with the material. A first experience with the material provides students with a \"need to know\", which allows learners to reflect on prior experiences with the content, which can help learners construct meaning from instruction. Worked examples are guiding tools that can act as a \"need to know\" for students. Worked examples provide students with straightforward goals, step-by-step instructions as well as ready-to-solve problems that can help students develop a stronger understanding from instruction.\n\nGuiding has a key role both in constructivism and 'instructivism'. For instructivists the timing of guidance is immediate, either at the beginning or when the learner makes a mistake, whereas in constructivism it can be delayed. It has been found that immediate feedback can lead to working memory load as it does not take in consideration the process of gradual acquisition of a skill, which also relates to the amount of guidance being given. Research on intelligent-tutoring systems suggests that immediate feedback on errors is a great strategy to promote learning, as the learner is able to integrate the feedback from short-term memory into the overall learning and problem solving task; the longer the wait on feedback, the harder it is for the learner to make this integration. Yet, in another study it was found that providing feedback right after the error can deprive the learner of the opportunity to develop evaluative skills. Wise and O'Neill bring these two, seemingly contradictory findings, and argue that it does not only prove the importance of the role of feedback, but that points out a timing feature of feedback: immediate feedback in the short term promotes more rapid problem solving but delaying feedback can result in better retention and transfer in the long term.\n\nConstructivism views knowledge as a \"function of how the individual creates meaning from his or her own experiences\". Constructivists advocate that learning is better facilitated in a minimally guided environment where learners construct important information for themselves. According to constructivism, minimal guidance in the form of process or task related information should be provided to learners upon request and direct instruction of learning strategies should not be used because it impedes the natural processes learners use to recall prior experiences. \nIn this view, for learners to construct knowledge they should be provided with the goals and minimal information and support. Applications that promote constructivist learning require learners to solve authentic problems or \"acquire knowledge in information-rich settings\". An example of an application of constructivist learning is science instruction, where students are asked to discover the principles of science by imitating the steps and actions of researchers.\n\nInstructionism are educational practices characterized for being instructor-centered. Some authors see instructionism as a highly prescriptive practice that mostly focuses on the formation of skills, that is very product-oriented and is not interactive; or that is a highly structured, systematic and explicit way of teaching that gives emphasis to the role of the teacher as a transmitter of knowledge and the students as passive receptacles. The 'transmission' of knowledge and skills from the teacher to the student in this context is often manifested in the form of drill, practice and rote memorization. An 'instructionist', then, focuses on the preparation, organization and management of the lesson making sure the plan is detailed and the communication is effective. The emphasis is on the up-front explicit delivery of instruction.\n\nInstructionism is often contrasted with constructivism. Both of them use the term guidance as means to support learning, and how it can be used more effectively. The difference in the use of guidance is found in the philosophical assumptions regarding the nature of the learner, but they also differ in their views around the quantity, the context and the timing of guidance. An example of application of instructionism in the classroom is direct instruction.\n\nInstructional scaffolding can be thought of as the strategies that a teacher uses to help learners bridge a cognitive gap or progress in their learning to a level they were previously unable to accomplish. These strategies evolve as the teachers evaluate the learners initial level of ability and then through continued feedback throughout the progression of the task. In the early studies, scaffolding was primarily done in oral, face- to-face learning environments. In classrooms, scaffolding may include modelling behaviours, coaching and prompting, thinking out loud, dialogue with questions and answers, planned and spontaneous discussions, as well as other interactive planning or structural assistance to help the learner bridge a cognitive gap. This can also include peer mentoring from more experienced students.\n\nThere are a wide variety of scaffolding strategies that teachers employ. One approach to looking at the application of scaffolding is to look at a framework for evaluating these strategies.\nThis model was developed based on the theoretical principles of scaffolding to highlight the use of scaffolding for educational purposes. It highlights two components of an instructors use of scaffolding. The first is the instructors intentions and the second refers to the means by which the scaffolding is carried out.\n\nScaffolding intentions:\nThese groups highlight the instructors intentions for scaffolding\n\nScaffolding means:\nThese groups highlight the ways in which the instructor scaffolds\n\nAny combination of scaffolding means with scaffolding intention can be construed as a scaffolding strategy, however, whether a teaching strategy qualifies as good scaffolding generally depends upon its enactment in actual practice and more specifically upon whether the strategy is applied contingently and whether it is also part of a process of fading and transfer of responsibility.\n\nExamples of scaffolding:\n\nInstructors can use a variety of scaffolds to accommodate different levels of knowledge. The context of learning (i.e. novice experience, complexity of the task) may require more than one scaffold strategy in order for the student to master new content. The following table outlines a few common scaffolding strategies:\n\nWhen we teach students who are not physically present in the classroom, instructors need to adapt to the environment and their scaffolding needs to be adjusted to fit this new learning medium. It can be challenging to find a way to adjust the verbal and visual elements of scaffolding to construct a successful interactive and collaborative learning environment for distance learning.\n\nThe recent spread of technology used in education has opened up the learning environment to include hypermedia, hypertext, collaborative learning environments, and web-based learning environments. This challenges traditional learning design conceptions of scaffolding for educators.\n\nA recent review of the types of scaffolding used in online learning identified four main types of scaffolding:\n\n\nThese four types are structures that appropriately support students' learning in online environments. Other scaffolding approaches that were addressed by the researchers included: technical support, content support, argumentation template, questioning and modelling. These terms were rarely used, and it was argued that these areas had unclear structure to guide students, especially in online learning, and were inadequately justified.\n\nAs technology changes, so does the form of support provided to online learners. Instructors have the challenge of adapting scaffolding techniques to this new medium, but also the advantage of using new web-based tools such as wikis and blogs as platforms to support and discuss with students.\n\nAs the research in this area progresses, studies are showing that when students learn about complex topics with computer-based learning environments (CBLEs) without scaffolding they demonstrated poor ability to regulate their learning, and failure to gain a conceptual understanding of the topic. As a result, researchers have recently begun to emphasize the importance of embedded conceptual, procedural, strategic, and metacognitive scaffolding in CBLEs.\n\nIn addition to the four scaffolding guidelines outlined, recent research has shown:\n\nAn online learning environment warrants many factors for scaffolding to be successful, this includes basic knowledge of the use of technology, social interactions and reliance on student’s individual motivation and initiative for learning.  Collaboration is key to instructional scaffolding and can be lost without proper guidance from an instructor creating and initiating an online social space.  \n\nThe instructor’s role in creating a social space for online interaction has been found to increase student’s confidence in understanding the content and goals of the course.  If an instructor does not create this space a student misses out on critical-thinking, evaluating material and collaborating with fellow students to foster learning.  Even with instructors implementing a positive social space online, a research study found that students perceptions of incompetence to other classmates is not affected by positive online social spaces but found this to be less of a problem in face-face courses.  \n\nDue to the distance learning that encompasses an online environment, self-regulation is essential for scaffolding to be effective, a study has shown that procrastinators are at a disadvantage in online distance learning and are not able to be scaffolded in the same degree as if there was an in-person instructor.  \n\nStudents who had more desire to master the content than to receive higher grades were more successful in the online courses.  A study by Artino and Stephens found that graduate students were more motivated in online course than undergraduate students but suggests academic level may contribute to the amount of technological support that is needed for positive learning outcomes, finding that undergraduate students needed less support than graduate students when navigating an online course.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "244111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244111", "title": "Law of Jante", "text": "Law of Jante\n\nThe Law of Jante () is a code of conduct said to be common in Nordic countries, that portrays doing things out of the ordinary, being overtly personally ambitious, or not conforming, as unworthy and inappropriate. \n\nThe attitudes were first formulated in the form of the ten rules of Jante Law by the Dano-Norwegian author Aksel Sandemose, in his satirical novel \"A Fugitive Crosses His Tracks\" (\"En flyktning krysser sitt spor\", 1933), but the actual attitudes themselves would be older. His novel portrays the fictional small Danish town Jante, which he modelled upon his native town Nykøbing Mors in the 1930s, which was typical of all small towns and communities, where nobody was anonymous.\n\nUsed generally in colloquial speech in the Nordic countries as a sociological term to denote a condescending attitude towards individuality and success, the term refers to a mentality that diminishes individual effort and places all emphasis on the collective, while simultaneously denigrating those who try to stand out as individual achievers.\n\nThere are ten rules in the law as defined by Sandemose, all expressive of variations on a single theme and usually referred to as a homogeneous unit: \"You are not to think you're anyone special or that you're better than us.\" \nThe ten rules state:\n\nIn the book, the Janters who transgress this unwritten 'law' are regarded with suspicion and some hostility, as it goes against the town's communal desire to preserve harmony, social stability and uniformity.\n\nAn eleventh rule recognised in the novel as 'the penal code of Jante' is:\n\nFrom the chapter \"Maybe you don't think I know something about you\":\n\"\"That one sentence (the eleventh rule), which acts as the penal code of Jante, as such was rich in content. It was a charge of all sorts of things, and that it also had to be, because absolutely nothing was allowed. It was also an elaborate indictment, with all kinds of unspecified penalties given to be expected. Furthermore it was useful, depending fully on tone of voice, in financial extortion and enticement into criminal acts, and it could also be the best means of defense.\" \n\nSandemose wrote about the working class in the town of Jante, a group of people of the same social position. He expressly stated in later books that the social norms of Jante were universal and not intended to depict any particular town or country. Sandemose did not invent the rules; he was seeking to formulate and describe attitudes that had already been part of the Danish and Norwegian psyche for centuries.\n\nAlthough intended as criticism, the meaning of the Law of Jante has shifted to refer to personal criticism of people who want to break out of their social groups and reach a higher position in society in general.\n\nIt is common in Scandinavia to claim the Law of Jante as something quintessentially Danish, Norwegian or Swedish. The rules are treated as a way of behaving in order to fit in and results in dressing similarly and the types of cars that people buy and buying similar products for their homes.\n\nIt's commonly stated that Jante Law is for people in the provinces, but commentators have suggested that metropolitan areas are also affected.\n\nWhile the original intention was as satire, Kim Orlin Kantardjiev, a Norwegian politician and educational advisor, claims that the Law of Jante is taught in schools, is treated more as a social code to encourage group behaviour, and has been credited with making Nordic countries more harmonious and equal by pointing out the intrinsic conflicts between individuality and social conformity. He also asserts that the laws may be one of the reasons Nordic countries have high happiness scores. and feels the law might be summarised as \"You shouldn't think you're better than everyone else.\" Though the law, as defined by Sandemose, is meant to control and shame achievers of all kinds, regardless of wealth, Kantardjiev makes the association that in countries such as America, being rich allows people to behave differently, and Jante Laws tend to level out society, as the people as a whole get to set the rules, not the rich alone.\n\nIn Scandinavia, articles appear regularly, however, which link the Law of Jante to high suicide rates.\n\nBacklash has occurred against the rules, and in Norway someone even placed a grave for Jante Laws, declaring them dead in 2005. However, others have questioned whether they will ever go away, as they may be firmly entrenched in society.\n\n\n\nAndersen, Steen: Nye forbindelser. Pejlinger i Aksel Sandemoses forfatterskab.

{"id": "226126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226126", "title": "Legalism (theology)", "text": "Legalism (theology)\n\nLegalism (or nomism), in Christian theology, is the act of putting the Law of Moses above the gospel, which is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, by establishing requirements for salvation beyond faith (trust) in Jesus Christ, specifically, trust in His finished work - the shedding of His blood for our sins, and reducing the broad, inclusive, and general precepts of the Bible to narrow and rigid moral codes. It is an over-emphasis of discipline of conduct, or legal ideas, usually implying an allegation of misguided rigour, pride, superficiality, the neglect of mercy, and ignorance of the grace of God or emphasizing the letter of law at the expense of the spirit. Legalism is alleged against any view that obedience to law, not faith in God's grace, is the pre-eminent principle of redemption. On the viewpoint that redemption is not earned by works, but that obedient faith is required to enter and remain in the redeemed state, see covenantal nomism.\n\nThe words 'legalism' or 'legalist' do not occur in the Old or New Testaments. Legalism's root word, \"law\" (Greek \"nomos\"), occurs frequently in the New Testament, and sometimes is interpreted as legalism. In 1921, Ernest De Witt Burton stated that in , \"\"nomou\" is here evidently used ... in its legalistic sense, denoting divine law viewed as a purely legalistic system made up of statutes, on the basis of obedience or disobedience to which individuals are approved or condemned as a matter of debt without grace. This is divine law as the legalist defined it.\" The Greek of Paul's day lacked any term corresponding to the distinct position of \"legalism\", \"legalist\", or \"legalistic\", leading C.E.B. Cranfield to commend \"the possibility that Pauline statements which at first sight seem to disparage the law, were really directed not against the law itself but against that misunderstanding and misuse of it for which we now have a convenient terminology\" (legalism). Messianic Jewish Bible translator David H. Stern cited these two scholars to support the translation framework that often \"<nowiki>'</nowiki>\"nomos\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> means 'legalism' and not God's \"Torah\"\", especially in Paul's constructs \"erga nomou\" (literally \"works of law\", rendered by Stern \"legalistic observance of \"Torah\" commands\") and \"upo nomon\" (literally \"under law\", rendered by Stern by 13 words, \"in subjection to the system which results from perverting the \"Torah\" into legalism\").\n\nOne concept of legalism, the belief that salvation can be earned by obedience to laws, is referred to in various New Testament books, including Galatians. In this case, some Jews who had become Christians believed that in order to obtain salvation, both faith in Christ (as Messiah), and obedience to the Mosiac laws were required, such as the cases of the circumcision controversy and the Incident at Antioch. Generally, however, these cases are referred to as the Judaizer controversy, rather than a legalism controversy, but the two are related.\n\nLegalism refers to any doctrine which states salvation comes strictly from adherence to the law. It can be thought of as a works-based religion. Groups in the New Testament said to be falling into this category include the Pharisees, Sadducees, Scribes, Judaizers, and Nicolaitans. They are legalists because they emphasized obeying the Law of Moses, in the case of the Pharisees and Scribes, to the letter without understanding the concept of grace. Jesus condemned their legalism in Matthew 23. The Pharisees love of the praises of men for their strict adherence is said to be a prime example of legalism.\n\nLegalism is sometimes confused with obedience. New Testament books such as Romans, speak of grace and obedience together. An example is found in Romans 1:5 (New American Standard Version) speaking of Christ 'through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles, for His name's sake...' The goal of receiving the grace was to bring about obedience of faith. Here grace, faith and obedience are tied together. Other references are in Acts 5:29, 32; Romans 16:19; 2 Corinthians 7:15; Hebrews 5:9.\n\nLegalism is also confused with discipline, which is often spoken of in a positive light. See 1 Corinthians 9:17; 1 Timothy 4:7; 2 Timothy 1:7 and Hebrews 12:5–11.\n\nA third common misunderstanding of legalism is the word law. Law in many places in the Bible refers to the Law of Moses, see also Biblical law in Christianity. In Galatians the Judaizers were trying to insist that salvation required that a person be circumcised prior to obeying the Law of Christ. Galatians 2:16 says, \"Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified\" (King James Version). The faith here is the Law of Christ and the law here is the Law of Moses. The legalism of the Judaizers was that obedience to the law of Moses was necessary to be saved.\n\nLegalism in the New Testament is believed by some as being revealed by the life of Saul prior to his conversion. Some believe that Saul sought to redeem himself by his works of persecution of the church and its ultimate destruction. Acts 26:9–11 reveals, \"I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities\" (King James Version). Galatians 1:13–14 states, \"For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers\" (King James Version). These two texts emphasize the nature of Saul's religion, works.\n\nHowever, in this passage the obedience is not tied to the obeying of specific Old Testament laws, such as keeping Sabbath or circumcision.\n\nAt the Council of Jerusalem, c. 50, James the Just decreed the \"Apostolic Decree\":\n\nThough the \"Apostolic Decree\" is no longer observed by many Christian denominations today, it is still observed in full by the Greek Orthodox. and it was a very effective philosophy during that time.\n\nIn Roman Catholicism, good works are done in service to God and one's neighbour, by faith working through love. In contrast, a severity in the imposition of, or overly scrupulous conformity to any rule of piety, may be charged with legalism.\n\nIn an attempt to resolve the dispute over legalism, the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification was a document issued in 1999 by Lutheran-Catholic clerical representatives, declaring a common belief in \"Sola gratia\", that grace alone can save the faithful, and that there is a \"progressive infusion\" of grace in the spirit of the believer.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox, for another example, rejects the satisfaction theory of the atonement as \"legalistic\". The satisfaction theory states that mankind's Original Sin violated God's law, resulting in all men being born guilty: an idea prevalent in the writings of Tertullian and Augustine of Hippo of the Western Church. Anselm formally developed the theory that the legal problem of guilt before the Law, required the legal solution of retribution, in order to achieve a just salvation. The solution was for God's son Jesus to willingly die on the Cross in place of humanity, thus allowing the legal penalty to be fully carried out, satisfying the justice of God, and thus clearing the way for mercy to be shown to sinners. The Eastern Orthodox charge that this theory is too dependent upon Roman legal concepts of retribution and justice. [citation needed]\n\nIn Protestant, Evangelical, Christian theology, especially in popular versions of the same, the charge of legalism is an accusation of overzealous adherence to the word of the Bible (as law) in all things said, established or accomplished in a believer's life (cf. bibliolatry). In that context, to apply the criticism of legalism to a theological position or religious attitude implies that the accused has overturned the Gospel of salvation through faith and new life in Jesus Christ and has instead substituted some principle of personal works of strict adherence to the word, through action, thought, or speech for the unearned grace of God.\n\nThroughout the history of Christianity, certain beliefs and practices have tended to draw charges of legalism. These include:\n\n\nSeveral underlying dynamics appear in these controversies. The permitted scope of veneration of material objects versus claims that such veneration is idolatry, affects the perceived sanctity of ritual spaces and objects, and therefore of the rituals and customs themselves. Teachings about the authority of the church, the sources of legitimacy of that authority, and the role of clergy versus the priesthood of all believers, also affect these debates.\n\n\n"}

The term originates from wolf behavior. Normally a pack animal, wolves that have left or been excluded from their pack are described as lone wolves.\n\nAs an animal, a lone wolf is a wolf that lives independently rather than with others as a member of a pack.\n\nIn the animal kingdom, lone wolves are typically older female wolves driven from the pack, perhaps by the breeding male, or young adults in search of new territory. Many female wolves between the ages of one to four years old leave their family to search for a pack of their own. This has the effect of preventing inbreeding as there is typically only one breeding pair in a wolf pack. Very few wolves will simply remain lone wolves; as such, these lone wolves may be stronger, more aggressive and far more dangerous than the average wolf that is a member of a pack. However, lone wolves have difficulty hunting, as wolves' favorite prey, large ungulates, are troublesome for a single wolf to bring down alone. Instead, lone wolves will generally hunt smaller animals and scavenge carrion.\n\nAs a person, a lone wolf is an individual who prefers solitude, expresses introversion, or works alone.\n\nIn literature, lone wolves are aloof and emotionally unable or unwilling to directly interact with other characters in the story. A stereotypical lone wolf will be dark or serious in personality; they are often taciturn and distinguished by their reserved nature. A lone wolf often has undergone some emotional trauma which separates them from the crowd.\n\nA similar concept is the lone wolf of a particular group, who spends enough time with a group to be considered a member but not enough time to be very close to the other members. Such people tend to not take part in the group activities or \"get-togethers\". Part of this concept arises from the fact that the lone wolf has been pushed away from the group but still has a very strong bond to the \"pack\". He or she will use the traits of the former pack to find and develop a new one if possible. This may involve establishing mating dominance of a certain member of another pack. This refreshes the idea that this behavior is suggestive of rejected inbreeding within a social system.\n\n"}

It may also be described as a belief in malignant occult powers possessed by certain people.\n\nElsdon Best (1859-1931) portrayed the belief in mākutu as \"universal and prominent in pre-European times\", stating that it acted as \"a disciplinary force in the old days; it was one of the substitutes for civil law that preserved order in a Māori community\". Best noted that the effectiveness of mākutu was heightened by the fact that it could be carried out in secret; the element of uncertainty produced caution on the part of those who might otherwise transgress the laws of the community. It was widely believed that those expert in mākutu were able to use the art to kill people. But there were limits on their freedom to act: should an irresponsible practitioner of the dark arts become a nuisance to a tribe, the solution to the problem simply involved killing the errant magician without delay. The training undergone by an apprentice was long and difficult, involving secret rituals and tests. \n\nAn October 2007 mākutu-lifting in the Lower Hutt suburb of Wainuiomata led to the death by drowning of a woman and the hospitalisation of a teen, allegedly due to attempts to remove such a curse.\n\n"}

This method of distributing red envelopes is now quite popular in the country.\n\nRed envelopes are gifts presented at social and family gatherings such as weddings or holidays such as Chinese New Year. The red color of the envelope symbolizes good luck and is a symbol to ward off evil spirits. The act of requesting red packets is normally called \"tao hongbao\" () or \"yao lishi\" (), and in the south of China, \"dou li shi\" (). Red envelopes are usually given out by married couples to single people, regardless of age, or by older to younger ones during holidays and festivals.\n\nThe amount of money contained in the envelope usually ends with an even digit, in accordance with Chinese beliefs; odd-numbered money gifts are traditionally associated with funerals. The exception being the number 9 as it pronunciation of \"nine\" is homophonus to the word \"long\" and is the largest digit. Still in some regions of China and in its diaspora community, odd numbers are favored for weddings because they are difficult to divide. There is also a widespread tradition that money should not be given in fours, or the number four should not appear in the amount, such as in 40, 400 and 444, as the pronunciation of the word \"four\" is homophonous to the word \"death\".\n\nAt wedding banquets, the amount offered is usually intended to cover the cost of the attendees as well as signify goodwill to the newlyweds. Amounts given are often recorded in ceremonial ledgers for the new couple to keep.\n\nDuring the Chinese New Year, in Southern China, red envelopes are typically given by the married to the unmarried, most of whom are children. In northern and southern China, red envelopes are typically given by the elders to the younger under 25 (30 in most of the three northeastern provinces), regardless of marital status, while in some regions red envelopes are only given to the young people without jobs. The amount of money is usually notes to avoid heavy coins and to make it difficult to judge the amount inside before opening. It is traditional to put brand new notes inside red envelopes and also to avoid opening the envelopes in front of the relatives out of courtesy.\n\nIt is also given during the Chinese New Year in workplace from a person of authority (supervisors or owner of the business) out of his own fund to employees as a token of good fortune for the upcoming year.\n\nIn acting, it is also conventional to give an actor a red packet when he or she is to play a dead character, or pose for a picture for an obituary or a grave stone. \n\nRed packets are also used to deliver payment for favorable service to lion dance performers, religious practitioners, teachers, and doctors.\n\nDuring the Chinese New Year holiday in 2014, the mobile instant messaging service WeChat introduced the ability to distribute virtual red envelopes of money to contacts and groups via its mobile payment platform. The feature became considerably popular, owing to its contemporary interpretation of the traditional practice, and a promotional giveaway held during the CCTV New Year's Gala, China's most-watched television special, where viewers could win red envelopes as prizes. Adoption of WeChat Pay saw a major increase following the launch, and two years later, over 32 billion virtual envelopes were sent over the Chinese New Year holiday in 600bc (itself a tenfold increase over 2015). The popularity spawned a \"red envelope war\" between WeChat owner Tencent and its historic rival, Alibaba Group, which added a similar function to its competing messaging service and has held similar giveaway promotions, and imitations of the feature from other vendors. Analysts estimated that over 100 billion digital red envelopes would be sent over the New Year holiday in 2017.\n\nIn China, during the Qin Dynasty, the elderly would thread coins with a red string. The money was referred to as \"money warding off evil spirits\" () and was believed to protect the person of younger generation from sickness and death. The \"yasui qian\" was replaced by red envelopes when printing presses became more common and is now found written using the homophone for \"\" that means \"old age\" instead of \"evil spirits\" thus, \"money warding off old age\" (). Red envelopes continue to be referred to by such names today.\n\nOther similar traditions also exist in other countries in Asia. In Thailand, Myanmar (Burma) and Cambodia, the Chinese diaspora and immigrants have introduced the culture of red envelopes.\n\nIn Cambodia, red envelopes are called Ang Pav or Tae Ea(give Ang Pav). Ang Pav is delivered with best wishes from elder to younger generations. The money amount in Ang Pav makes young children happy and is a most important gift which traditionally reflects the best wishes as a symbol of good luck for the elders. Ang Pav can be presented in the day of Chinese New Year or \"Saen Chen\", when relatives gather together. The gift is kept as a worship item in or under the pillowcase, or somewhere else, especially near the bed of young while they are sleeping in New Year time. Gift in Ang Pav can be either money or a cheque, and more or less according to the charity of the donors.\nThe tradition of the delivery of Ang Pav traditionally descended from one generation to another a long time ago. Ang Pav will not be given to some one in family who has got a career, but this person has to, in return, deliver it to their parents and/or their younger children or siblings.\nAt weddings, the amount offered is usually intended to cover the cost of the attendees as well as help the newly married couple.\n\nIn Vietnam, red envelopes are considered to be lucky money and are typically given to children. They are generally given by the elders and adults, where a greeting or offering health and longevity is exchanged by the younger generation. Common greetings include \"Sống lâu trăm tuổi\", \"An khang thịnh vượng\" (安康興旺), \"Vạn sự như ý\" (萬事如意) and Sức khỏe dồi dào, which all relate back to the idea of wishing health and prosperity as age besets everyone in Vietnam on the Lunar New Year. The typical name for lucky money is lì xì or, less commonly, mừng tuổi.\n\nIn South Korea and Japan, a monetary gift is given to children by their relatives during the New Year period. In both countries, however, white envelopes are used instead of red, with the name of the receiver written on the back. A similar practice, Shūgi-bukuro, is observed for Japanese weddings, but the envelope is folded rather than sealed, and decorated with an elaborate bow.\n\nIn the Philippines, Chinese Filipinos exchange red envelopes (termed \"ang pao\") during the Lunar New Year, which is an easily recognisable symbol. The red envelope has gained wider acceptance among non-Chinese Filipinos, who have appropriated the custom for other occasions such as birthdays, and in giving monetary \"aguinaldo\" during Christmas.\n\nRed packets as a form of bribery in China's film industry were revealed in 2014's Sony hack.\n\nMalay Muslims in Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and Singapore have adopted the Chinese custom of handing out monetary gifts in envelopes as part of their Eid al-Fitr (Malay: \"Hari Raya Aidilfitri\") celebrations, but instead of red packets, green envelopes are used. Customarily a family will have (usually small) amounts of money in green envelopes ready for visitors, and may send them to friends and family unable to visit. Green is used for its traditional association with Islam, and the adaptation of the red envelope is based on the Muslim custom of \"sadaqah\", or voluntary charity. While present in the Qur'an, \"sadaqah\" is much less formally established than the sometimes similar practice of \"zakat\", and in many cultures this takes a form closer to gift-giving and generosity among friends than charity in the strict sense, i.e. no attempt is made to give more to guests \"in need\", nor is it as a religious obligation as Islamic charity is often viewed.\n\nThe tradition of \"ang pao\" has also been adopted by the local Indian Hindu populations of Singapore and Malaysia for Deepavali. They are known as \"Deepavali ang pow\" (in Malaysia), \"purple ang pow\" or simply \"ang pow\" (in Singapore). Yellow coloured envelopes for Deepavali have also been available at times in the past.\n\n\n\n"}

The word “regional heritage” is a parallel to the word world heritage but does not refer to a specific object, but rather sets of sites, buildings and landscapes perceived to be valuable. Regional heritage are not formally appointed. Instead, it is subject to constant evaluation and discussion, and appears more or less clearly in the consensus among local, regional and national stakeholders.\n\nRegional heritage is physical environments, as perceived by humans. And in addition, its history, stories, customs and the \"genius loci\" that are constantly recreated and is transferred from generation to generation, creating a sense of identity and continuity.\n\nKeith Dewar writes: \"Heritage can be world heritage, regional heritage, or it can belong to a particular culture or simply to an extended family. Heritage should not be seen simply as cultural elements, since the natural environment also contains places of significance. Heritage value can be found in a national park or a farm woodlot.

However, unlike submarines, they cannot be entirely submerged below the surface of the water.\n\nThe most common design is one similar to a ship. The passenger cabin is relatively low, a few meters below sea level. The cabin is equipped with large windows into the water. The passengers can observe the marine environment that is passed during the voyage.\n\nThere are significant differences between a submarine and a semi-submarine from an engineering point of view. Submarines are human-occupied pressure vessels, while pressure concerns apply to a lesser extent to semi-submarines. As the pressure close to the water surface is relatively low, the viewing windows can be bigger. In some advanced designs the windows enclose the majority of the submersed hull, creating an experience comparable to scuba diving. Customers can leave the submerged cabin for the unsubmerged deck at any time.\n\nSemi-submarines can be used for research, but they are most commonly used in the tourism industry. However, large tourism-orientated semi submarines should not be confused with narco-submarines which are smaller home-made semi-submarines used to smuggle drugs.\n\nSemi-submarines do not have an international classified status.

Guests are expected to acknowledge and greet every person at a social occasion, including children and babies.\n\nWhen shaking hands, it is appropriate for the guest to first greet the person on their right-hand side, and then work their way left. This ensures that the guest's palm makes contact with the palm of the person receiving the handshake - touching the back of the hand instead of the palm is considered insulting or unlucky. Guests are expected to greet the most elderly person present first.\n\nThe same ritual is expected to be observed upon departure and should be carried out until sufficient familiarity has been established, at which point the ritual becomes redundant.\n\nWhen greeting dignitaries, this procedure is expected to be carried out by all persons present regardless of age or status.\n\nAsking a person to a social event (e.g. a bar or a restaurant) implies that the person offering the invite will be paying for everything. Inviting a person out and then expecting them to pay for themselves is considered extremely rude. When a foreigner is invited to visit a home or community, the guest is expected to bring a gift, commonly a bottle of Schnapps or Kasapreko gin which is available in any shop.\n\nNaming ceremonies and marriages are marked by family ceremonies. Seasonal festivals serve to bring people together in a spectacular fashion.\n\nWhen attending funerals, weddings, or naming ceremonies; women, including foreign women, must cover their heads with a hat or simple black cloth wound around the head. A man must not have his head covered.\n\nIt is unacceptable for women, particularly young foreign women, to wear revealing clothing. Women's clothing that would be acceptable in the West (shorts, low-cut strapped tops, etc.) is not socially acceptable in Ghanaian society. Similarly it is unacceptable for foreign men to be shirtless in public, and unacceptable for Ghanaian men to a lesser degree. Ghanaian social norms are sometimes difficult to establish as younger adults are generally much less inhibited about wearing revealing clothing or being shirtless, while older Ghanaian citizens may find such apparel to be insulting. A general rule is to dress conservatively unless in the company of people of one's own gender or age with whom one is well-acquainted.\n\nDrinking alcohol and smoking in public are serious \"faux pas\" and should be avoided. Public intoxication to any degree is generally viewed with extreme disapproval. Such activities are perfectly acceptable in a local bar though. When drinking alcohol, it is a common custom to pour the last few drops on the ground as a libation for the gods. People who decline from drinking alcohol may accept an alcoholic drink with gratitude, raise it to their lips without drinking, and then pour it on the ground. Raising the glass to the lips signifies gratitude and pouring the drink away is thus a socially acceptable alternative for those who do not drink. This custom permits non-drinking Ghanaians to join social events without offending those present by refusing a drink.\n\nTaking photographs of people unknown to the photographer must be conducted with the same level of consideration as in one's own country. Most Ghanaians are happy to pose for pictures, as it is considered polite.\n\n"}

It is the fourth game in the \"Syphon Filter\" series.\n\nThe gameplay is a huge departure from the previous games. Rather than playing as Gabe Logan, the player is given the role of a new recruit working for Gabe's secret anti-terrorist organization, the IPCA. Players are able to create an original agent using a character customization system.\n\nThe game also gives a non-linear, open-ended experience where players are given choices to take on certain tasks, or avoid them altogether. RPG elements were added so that players could create characters, level up their ranks, and unlock new weapons. Enemies constantly spawn so that players can never completely clear an area.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the original Syphon Filter virus, Gabriel Logan repurposes the agency Agency as the International Presidential Consulting Agency, serving as a counterterrorism unit. As Commander-in-Chief, Logan has Lian Xing, Teresa Lipan, Lawrence Mujari, and Dr. Elsa Weissenger serve as his officers.\n\nAn Agency team headed by Imani Gray is deployed to a besieged Carthage, Michigan in order to rescue Mujari, who disappeared while investigating Dr. Richard Broussard’s ties with the Anarchiste Liberation Army. Imani and her team successfully rescue Mujari, and assassinate the ALA leadership then prepare for their next assignment.\n\nMeanwhile, IPCA commander Gary Stoneman assassinates Italian mafia leader Dimitri Alexopoulous to prevent his acquisition of the Omega Strain in Italy. The team follows Stone to Belarus and tracks a shipment of infected cattle to Ivankov’s residence. They discover that his courier Yuschenko is selling the Omega Strain, and Agency pilot Alima Haddad is captured by the Chechens during the operation.\n\nDuring the Belarus operation, Lian is deployed to Kyrgistan in order to eliminate an arms deal involving a local warlord and the North Koreans.\n\nGabe reluctantly enlists help from Mossad agent Ehud Ben Zohar upon determining Yuschenko’s plans to sell the virus to Fatha Al-Hassan, a Yemeni leader. Zohar only cares about stopping Al-Hassan’s network, so he steals the viral canister after the Agency retrieves it from Yuschenko. Zohar and the team enter Al-Hassan's palace disguised as the dead Chechens in order to assassinate him. In the aftermath, they exchange the contracts for the virus.\n\nThe team investigates a lead recovered from the Belarus operation that shows Dr. Nikolai Jandran is conducting virus tests at a local university. Maggie Powers assists in recovering evidence before the university’s destruction.\n\nShortly after recovering, Mujari conducts his own investigation into the Chechens and photographs Russian forces committing war atrocities for future blackmail. Afterwards, Mujari takes control of the Agency team as they check the wreckage of the S.S. Lorelei. The university turned up salvaged boxes, indicating an undersea operation. The team evacuates the salvage rig before destroying the viral containers for good. However, Jandran dies from a serum before he can be brought back for questioning.\n\nWhile Gabe faces pressure from the U.S. president and Alex Birchim of the White House Internal Affairs, he sends Lian and the team to track North Korean agent Yong-jun Kim, a man connected to the Yakuza’s Murakawa Industries in Japan. The investigation reveals that Murakawa was helping develop the Omega Strain. Aramov arrived before Lian and forced Murakawa to commit suicide for trusting Kim. Kim posed as an employee working with Murakawa so he could get the virus.\n\nShortly after destroying the Japanese labs, the team is re-deployed to recover Imani in Myanmar. The plane carrying Imani and Kim had been shot down. Guilt-ridden, Lian takes the team to recover her body and the viral sample Kim was carrying. Despite claims that inclement weather brought down the jet, they find evidence indicating that Aramov had bribed the Myanmar army to shoot down the plane.\n\nGabe becomes frustrated with his investigation into the secret corporation Meta Global Funds, which he believes controls the Syphon Filter conspiracy. The purchase of Murakawa Industries by Meta Global was possible through Niculescu Funds, headed by international banker Mihai Niculescu. He deduces that Niculescu as the mastermind behind the conspiracy. Against Birchim's commands, Gabe brings the Agency team to the headquarters in Zurich. They find evidence linking Birchim to bribes, but nothing implicating Niculescu, and upload a virus to sabotage Niculescu financially.\n\nGabe conducts a solo investigation into Niculescu's Montenegro estate in a final effort to expose him. Although he did not find physical evidence, he learns of Aramov’s ties to Niculescu and learns that Ivankov plans to nuke Russia.\n\nHaving learned of Ivankov's location from Mara, the Agency mobilises to his base and prevents the missile's launch. Stone recovers an injured Alima. Ivankov is eventually killed by Gabe while attempting to escape.\n\nThanks to tissue and virus samples recovered by the IPCA, a vaccine for the Omega Strain virus is successfully synthesized, ending the threat with the aid of the World Health Organization. The President congratulates the IPCA and has Birchim arrested. Niculescu is killed by two anonymous gunmen as a result of his bank’s sabotage. Dr. Weissenger gives a written admission that she had the recruit kill Dr. Jandran, as well as signs of mental instability before disappearing from the Agency. Lastly, Stone aims his rifle at Aramov to assassinate her on Logan’s order.\n\nIn a June 2007 interview with GameSpy, franchise veteran John Garvin maintained his attachment to the game, and explained that it was originally not intended to feature a single player mode. Garvin implied that the ability to play through the campaign alone had been tacked on at the demand of parent company Sony Computer Entertainment, late into the development process, in order to broaden the game's appeal.\n\n\"Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain\" received mixed reviews. It received a score of 65.36% on GameRankings based on 48 reviews and 65/100 on Metacritic based on 47 reviews.\n"}

Usually danced as a group of boys and girls, all dressed in \"more\" (the Tahitian grass skirt, however not made of grass but of the fibers from the bark of the \"pūrau\" (hibiscus)). \n\nThe boys shake their knees (as scissors, from there the use of the word \"pāoti\" (scissors) for this movement), and the girls shake their hips (and their long, loose hairs, if they have them). In reality the movement of their knees is the engine which drives their hips. Their feet should stay flat on the ground and their shoulders should remain stationary. However traditionally in the Ote'a or Ura Pa'u, the hips in Tahiti are shaken round and round (in what is known as the fa'arapu) while in the Cook Islands the hips are in a side to side movement. But due to the tamure, this emphasis is less important. The movements of the hands is of secondary importance. The girls are largely standing still, the boys move around their partner, either facing her in front or hiding behind her back (as seen from the public). The tempo of the music is continuously increased up to the point where only the most experienced and fittest dancers can keep their shakings up. Depending on the performers, the sexual innuendo may be more or less obvious. The predecessor of the tāmūrē, the traditional upaupa was outlawed by the LMS missionaries for that reason.\nTāmūrē is a foreign word, the name of a fish in the Tuamotu, the real name of the dance is \"ori Tahiti\" (Tahitian dance). Shortly after the Second World War a soldier of the Pacific battalion, Louis Martin, wrote a song on a classic rhythm in which he used the word tāmūrē quite often as a tra-la-la. He afterwards was known as Tāmūrē Martin, and a new genre was born.\n\n"}

The goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus.\n\nIn the semantic web era, a growing number of communities and networked enterprises started to access and interoperate through the internet. Modeling these communities and their information needs is important for several web applications, like topic-driven web crawlers, web services, recommender systems, etc. The development of terminology extraction is also essential to the language industry.\n\nOne of the first steps to model the knowledge domain of a virtual community is to collect a vocabulary of domain-relevant terms, constituting the linguistic surface manifestation of domain concepts. Several methods to automatically extract technical terms from domain-specific document warehouses have been described in the literature.\n\nTypically, approaches to automatic term extraction make use of linguistic processors (part of speech tagging, phrase chunking) to extract terminological candidates, i.e. syntactically plausible terminological noun phrases, NPs (e.g. compounds \"credit card\", adjective-NPs \"local tourist information office\", and prepositional-NPs \"board of directors\" - in English, the first two constructs are the most frequent). Terminological entries are then filtered from the candidate list using statistical and machine learning methods. Once filtered, because of their low ambiguity and high specificity, these terms are particularly useful for conceptualizing a knowledge domain or for supporting the creation of a domain ontology or a terminology base. Furthermore, terminology extraction is a very useful starting point for semantic similarity, knowledge management, human translation and machine translation, etc.\n\nThe methods for terminology extraction can be applied to parallel corpora. Combined with e.g. co-occurrence statistics, candidates for term translations can be obtained. Bilingual terminology can be extracted also from comparable corpora (corpora containing texts within the same text type, domain but not translations of documents between each other).\n\n"}

These works are counted among the most important and definitive treatises in Carnatic music theory. Each of these works contributed seminally to the growth of the Carnatic music tradition. These nine works are the \"Sangitasara\" by the sage Vidyaranya, \"Taladipika\" by Salva Gopa Tippendra, \"Sangitakalanidhi\" by Kallinatha, Bhandaru Vittaleshwara's commentary on the \"Sangita Ratnakara\", Bhandaru Lakshminarayana's \"Sangitasuryodaya\", Achyutadevaraya's \"Talakalabdhi/Talakalavriddhi\" and the much celebrated \"Swaramelakalanidhi\" by Ramamatya.\n\nThe reign of Vijayanagara empire was a watershed period in the cultural history of South India, particularly the history of Carnatic music. The period witnessed the prolific contributions of numerous musicians, saints and theoreticians. By virtue of the geo-political influence it exerted, Vijayanagara had become the confluence of many religions, art forms and cultures. Society and culture went through a process of conflict and eclectic assimilation of the traditional and elite values on the one hand and the emerging folk and foreign influences on the other. There was a strong interaction between traditional and elite values on the one hand and folk and foreign influences on the other. Much of this was also the result of a reaction and revolt against emerging sociological and aesthetic trends. Even as this assimilation and nativization of the contending or opposing influences took place, traditional purity and historical continuity continued to be preserved. These cultural trends and objectives were later sustained and fostered in the several feudatory states that continued to thrive beyond the fall of the Vijayanagar empire. Some of the notable states included Anegundi, Penukonda, Tanjore, Mysore Kingdom, Madurai, Ikkeri etc..\n\nA wide range of experiments and innovations were carried out in the field of instruments too. The Tamburi introduced during the period soon became the principal drone instrument. Seminal work and innovations also took place in the Vina keyboards with regard to the accordatura, tonal range and instrumental parameters. The \"mela\" replaced the \"grama\" and it's the theoretical possibilities were fully explored through mathematical schemes of tabulation. The innovation of the concept of \"mela\" and organization of the entirety of contemporary melodic material under its umbrella culminated in Venkatamakhin's \"Melakarta\" scheme, one which continues to influence greatly the theory and practice of Carnatic music to this day. New classificatory models emerged for ragas; \"svayambhusvara\" (upper partials), \"paryaya-svara\" (alternative svara denomination) and \"pratinidhi-svara\" (representative note) scales and intervals were tuned to be brought into alignment with contemporary musical practice.\n\nVarious melodic and rhythmic structures found their way art music. All music became \"desi\" and \"marga\" music passed into oblivion as did the \"madhyamagrama\" and its paraphernalia. The totality of melody came to be referred to \"sadja grama\" alone. The arbitrary, archaic and prolific \"desi talas\" made way for the suladi talas engendered by the Haridasas. These were further refined based on the principles of the ten vital elements called \"taladasaprana\". \n\nAt the height of the Vijayanagara empire great saint-composers like Purandara Dasa, Sripadaraya, Vyasaraya, Vadirajatirtha, Kanaka Dasa, Tallapakam Annamacharya and his descendants, and Nijagunashivayogi flourished. Musical forms, the \"Kriti\", the \"Suladi\", the \"Ugabhoga\", the \"Dandaka\", the \"Urttanama\", the \"Namavali\", the \"Mundige\", the \"Gita\", the \"Thaya\" and the \"Prabandha\" developed and found wide currency during this period.\n\nThroughout the Vijayanagara period, theory and musical practice kept pace with each other closely. Great musicologists like Vidyaranya, Salva Gopa Tippendra, Kallinatha, Kumbhakarna, Ramamatya, Laksmanarayana, Pandarika Vittala, Somanatha, Locana Jha and Hrdayanarayanadeva contributed to musical theory of both North and South India during this period. Tanappacharya, Govinda Dikshita and Venkatamakhin made foundational contributions from Tanjore about a century later. Each work of these scholars records a revolutionary and seminal concept or development which cumulatively resulted in modern Carnatic music. Nine musicological treatises of great significance were composed in the Vijayanagar period and these have been called the Vijayanagara \"Sangitashastra Navaratna\" or the 'Vijayanagara Musicological Nonet'.\n\nThe first of the \"navaratnas\" is Vidyaranya's \"Sangitasara\", composed in the second half of the fourteenth century. The work dealt with, among other things, the fifteen \"melas\" and their fifty \"janya ragas\" as well as certain types of singers. Some of this even found its way into Govinda Dikshita's \"Sangitasudha\" (\"nidhi\"), authored in the early seventeenth century.\n\nThe second of the nonet (chronologically) is the \"Taladipika\". Authored in the mid-fifteenth century by Salva Gopa-Tippendra, brother-in-law of king Praudha Devaraya II and a viceroy of Mulbagal, the work deals at great length with the tala. It describes over a hundred desi talas including some of the author's own inventions. Most importantly, the concept of \"taladasaprana\" (ten vital elements of tala) is elucidated for the first time in the work. This innovation was to prove so influential that, following its explication, all temporal activities in music and dance came to be organized and consolidated under these elements.\n\nTo the same period belongs the third work of the Nonet, Kallinatha's\"Sangitakalanidhi\", a versatile commentary on Sharngadeva's \"Sangita Ratnakara\", the encyclopedic magnum opus on Indian music. It was about dancing and aesthetics of the thirteenth century. In the work, Kallinatha meticulously annotated, explicated, criticised and emphasised all the central issues of the \"Ratnakara\"; he also illumined it through comparison with contemporary practices, theories and norms of music and dance. He anticipated many developments in these arts.\n\nA Telugu commentary by Bhandaru (-ri?) Vittaleshwara on the \"Sangitaratnakara\" in the last quarter of the fifteenth century forms the fourth of the \"navaratnas\".\nIn 1525, Vittaleshwara's son Bhandaru (ri?) Lakshminarayana composed the fifth treatise, the \"Sangitasuryodaya\", under the patronage of king Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagara.\n\nIn the generation that immediately followed, Achyutadevaraya's \"Talakalabdhi\"/\"Talakalavridhi\" was written. This was an important treatise on \"tala\". This work organizes for the first time the theory and practice of the \"suladi talas\" of the Haridasas in terms of the \"dasapranas\". In the work, he also compiles views from several earlier works on \"tala\" such as Talakalavilasa, Sangitavidyavinoda, Jainamata, Sangitamarga, Chaturasabhavilasa, Sangitachudamani, Anjaneyamata, Nrttachudamani, Sangitamanidarpana, Katyayaniya, Sangitarnava, Rangaraja Bharatabhashya, Kapardi, and Parameshvara (all of them non-extant), and refutes them. \nFurther, Achyutaraya applies all the five \"laghu-jatis\" to each \"suladi tala\" and thereby expands the scope and function of the \"suladi talas\". Around the same time, Ashtavadana Somabhatta composed the \"Svararagasudharasa\" or \"Natyachudamani\" under the guidance of his guru Sitarama and probably under Achyutaraya's patronage. This work is now available only in fragments.\n\nThe final 'gem' in the series is the much celebrated \"Svaramelakalanidhi\" authored by the illustrious Kallinatha's grandson, Ramamatya ca. 1550. Ramamatya was the royal composer and architect in the court of de facto king Aliya Rama Raya. He described himself as \"abhinavabharatacharya\" and \"todara-malla\" (meaning \"the hero(malla) who wears the honorific anklet(\"todar\")). The last epithet however, is usually interpreted by scholars as alluding to the Todarmal, a minister in Akbar's court, the anachronism notwithstanding. The Kannada term, in fact translates to 'the hero (malla) who wears the honorific anklet (todar)'.\n\n\"Svaramelakalanidhi\" importance lies in the fact that it is more relevant and related to modern practice than the books written prior to it. The work, spread over five chapters deals primarily with \"Raga\" and preliminary to it, describes the \"Mela-s\" for the classification of \"Raga\" - and the different \"Suddha svara-s\" and \"Vikrta svara-s\" constituting the \"Mela-s\". Similar works by other celebrated contemporaries like Pandarika Vitthala and Somanatha project a common theme, namely the description of \"Ragas\", classification under \"Melas\" and the enumeration of the \"Suddha\" and \"Vikrta svaras\" constituting the \"Melas\". Minor ideological differences can however be discerned among these works.\n\nThe \"Svaramelakalanidhi\" brings the theory up to date, rationalizes intervals and scales, introduces the concepts of \"svayambhu-svara\" (self-generating note, upper partial), \".dharashruti paryayatattva\" and \"pratinidhitattva\" of \"svaras\". \"Mukhari\" is established as the \"shuddhasvara saptaka\". It also fixes and standardizes musical intervals on the keyboard, defines the accordatura, range, preferred strings (for particular notes) etc., for a variety of stringed keyboards. It also innovates and dedicates a new keyboard to Achyutaraya. A new scheme for classifying ragas into \"uttama\" (superior), \"madhyama\" (middling) and \"adhama\" (inferior) on the basis of their expressive potential is also expounded in the work. It also resolves the problem of the \"antara\" and \"kaishiki\" notes.\n\n\n\n"}

It is home to about 160,000 people, and is also the native land of the Wassoulou genre of music.\n\nWassoulou surrounds the point where the borders of three present-day countries meet: Mali, Ivory Coast, and Guinea. It includes portions of southwestern Mali, northwestern Ivory Coast, and eastern Guinea. It is bordered by the Niger River to the northwest, and by the Sankarani River to the east.\n\nThe name \"Wassoulou\" is alternately spelled Wassulu, Wassalou, and Ouassalou.\n\nWassoulou is best known internationally as the birthplace of Wassoulou music, a style which blends traditional and modern influences with strong female vocalists and a pentatonic hunter's harp. Wassoulou music is one of the two forms of West African music ethnomusicologists believe to be the origin of the American blues, which developed out of music forms dating back to the American slave trade from West Africa. Some of the most famous residents of Wassoulou include the singers Oumou Sangare, Ramata Diakite and Coumba Sidibe.\n\nWassoulou's cultural importance is reflected in the development of internet resources, and the creation of \"Radio Wassoulou\" broadcasting from Yanfolila.\n\nWassoulou is also a dialect of the Eastern Maninkakan language, and is closely related to Kankan Mandinka. Speakers of Wassoulou number some 73,500 in Guinea, with 41,200 speakers estimated in Mali, where the closely related Bamanankan is also spoken. In the far northwest of Côte d'Ivoire there are some 21,000 Wassoulou speakers, where it is related to Wojenaka Maninka.\n\nInhabitants are known as Wassulu, Wassulunka or Wassulunke.\n\nThe Wassoulou area is a center for the mingling of several ethnic groups. The nomadic Fula people, who were believed to have emigrated from the Fouta Djallon highlands to the west, integrated into the indigenous Mandé peoples and adopting their language and customs sometime prior to the 18th century, at roughly the same time Islam spread into the area. There are also large populations of Mandinka peoples native to Wassoulou.\n\nWassoulou is also the name of an Islamic state, the Wassoulou Empire (1870–1898), ruled by Samori Ture and centered on his capital, Bissandugu. In 1870, Samori overthrew an older Wassoulou state within the Kingdom of Kénédougou, whose \"faama\" (ruler) was Dyanabufarina Modi, and expanded his empire from there, taking the Wassoulou name. While the history of the Mandinka Wassoulou states remain unclear, the small kingdoms of Kenedugu and Wassulu existed from at least the 1650s, benefiting from gold mining and trade in the area.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1853097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853097", "title": "Well-made play", "text": "Well-made play\n\nThe well-made play (, pronounced ) is a dramatic genre from nineteenth-century theatre first codified by French dramatist Eugène Scribe. Dramatists Victorien Sardou, Alexandre Dumas, fils, and Emile Augier wrote within the genre, each putting a distinct spin on the style. The well-made play was a popular form of entertainment. By the mid-19th century, however, it had already entered into common use as a derogatory term. Henrik Ibsen and the other realistic dramatists of the later 19th century (August Strindberg, Gerhart Hauptmann, Émile Zola, Anton Chekhov) built upon its technique of careful construction and preparation of effects in the genre problem play. \"Through their example\", Marvin Carlson explains, \"the well-made play became and still remains the traditional model of play construction.\"\nIn the English language, that tradition found its early 20th-century codification in Britain in the form of William Archer's \"Play-Making: A Manual of Craftmanship\" (1912), and in the United States with George Pierce Baker's \"Dramatic Technique\" (1919).\n\nThe form has a strong Neoclassical flavour, involving a tight plot and a climax that takes place close to the end of the play. The well-made play retains the shape of Aristotle's ideal Greek-tragedy model outlined in his \"Poetics\".\n\nThe well-made play can be broken down into a specific set of criteria. First, the story depends upon a key piece of information kept from some characters, but known to others (and to the audience). Most of the story takes place before the action of the play begins, making the beginning of the play a late point of attack. Exposition during act one explains actions that precede the opening scene, and generates the audience's sympathy for the hero (or heroes) over their rival (or rivals). The plot moves forward in a chain of actions that use minor reversals of fortune to create suspense. The pace builds towards a climactic obligatory scene, in which the hero triumphs. This scene contains a climactic reversal of fortune, or peripeteia. A dénouement follows, in which all remaining plot points are unraveled and resolved.\n\nA recurrent device that the well-made play employs is the use of letters or papers falling into unintended hands, in order to bring about plot twists and climaxes. The letters bring about an unexpected and climactic reversal of fortune, in which it is often revealed that someone is not who they pretend to be. Mistaken or mysterious identity as a basis for plot complications is referred to as \"qui pro quo\".\n\nEugene Scribe contributed over 300 plays and opera libretti to the dramatic literature canon. Thirty-five of these works are considered well-made-plays.\n\nHistory of French Neoclassic form lays a critical foundation for Scribe, who draws upon devices determined by the French Academy to create his dramatic structure. French Neoclassicism conceives of Verisimilitude, or the appearance of a plausible truth, as the aesthetic goal of a play. In 1638, the French Academy codified a system by which dramatists could achieve Verisimilitude in a verdict on the Le Cid debate. The monarchy enforced the standards of French Neoclassicism with a system of censorship under which funding and practice permits were issued to a limited number of theater companies. This system underwent small modifications, but remained essentially the same up until the French Revolution. Until then, restrictive laws inhibited the growth of new practices with the exception of those advocated by a few intrepid dramatists such as Voltaire, Diderot, and Beaumarchais. After the French Revolution, adherence to the form became an artistic choice instead of a political necessity.\n\nAlthough Scribe drew heavily upon Neoclassic devices, he used them in original ways that would not have been acceptable without new popular forms, such as those developed at the Boulevard theatres. In order to work around the formal monopoly of the Comédie Française in the middle of the 18th century, theater troupes experimenting with new dramatic forms sprang up along the Boulevard du Temple. Their aim was to escape the censors, and please the public. Popular reception of the boulevard theatres' explorations helped to crack the edifice of Neoclassic form. After the French Revolution, French theater opened to the influence of practices that had meanwhile developed in other places around Europe.\n\nScribe's development of a form that could be used repeatedly to turn out new material suited the demands of a growing middle class theater audience.\n\nScribe's influence on theater, according to Marvin J. Carlson, \"cannot be overestimated\". Carlson observes that, unlike other influential theater thinkers, Scribe did not write prefaces or manifestos declaiming his ideas. Scribe influenced theater, instead, with craftsmanship. He honed a dramatic form into a reliable mould that could be applied not only to different content, but to different content from a variety of playwrights. Carlson identifies a single instance of Scribe's critical commentary from a speech Scribe gave to the Académie française in 1836. Scribe expressed his view of what draws the audiences to theater:\n\n\"not for instruction or improvement, but for diversion and distraction, and that which diverts them [audience] most is not truth, but fiction. To see again what you have before your eyes daily will not please you, but that which is not available to you in every day life - the extraordinary and the romantic.\"\n\nAlthough Scribe advocated for a theater of amusement over didacticism, other writers, beginning with Alexandre Dumas, fils, adopted Scribe's structure to create didactic plays. In a letter to a critic, Dumas \"fils\" states,\"... if I can find some means to force people to discuss the problem, and the lawmaker to revise the law, I shall have done more than my duty as a writer, I shall have done my duty as a man.\". Dumas' thesis plays are plays written in the well-made style that take clear moral positions on social issues of the day. Emile Augier also used Scribe's formula to write plays addressing contemporary social issues, although he declares his moral position less strongly.\n\nBy the late 19th century, the well-made play had fallen out of critical favor. Shaw was among those who held the form in low regard, \"Why the devil should a man write like Scribe when he can write like Shakespeare or Moliere, Aristophanes or Euripides? Who was Scribe that he should dictate to me or anyone else how a play should be written?\" In reference to the form's tendency to favor amusing plot twists over complexly drawn characters, Shaw referred to the genre as Sardoodledom after Victorien Sardou, who also wrote in the well-made style.\n\nThe opening to the preface to \"Three Plays by Brieux\" offers another example of Shavian disdain for the well-made plays. Shaw identifies the process of creating them as an industry, and their creators as “literary mechanics” instead of artists. To convey how vulgar he finds a widely used playwrighting formula, Shaw interprets the aphorism \"Art for art's sake,\" as \"Success for money's sake.\"\n\nIn an essay published in PMLA in 1951, \"Pygmalion: Bernard Shaw’s Dramatic Theory and Practice\", Milton Crane reasons that Shaw’s disparagement of the classic well-made formula, and his desire to pry Ibsen’s work away from association with the works of Scribe and Sardou, serve a specific agenda. Crane argues that Shaw aims to prevent his own use of the well-made formula from linking his plays with work considered out of fashion. Shaw’s theory of the problem play and discussion ideas align his plays with Ibsen’s, and distinguishes them from stale plays of the past. Crane observes that Shaw, by his own admission, learned dramatic structure from contemporary popular theatre which was then dominated by the well-made formula. Crane goes on to argue how that formula is present in \"Pygmalion\", \"Man and Superman\", and \"The Doctor’s Dilemma\".\n\nShaw discusses the notion of the problem play in an essay of the same title published in 1895. He defines a problem play as one that puts a person or people in conflict with an institution, confronting a contemporary social question. He cites the \"Woman question\" as a contemporary example. Ibsen's engagement with the \"Woman question\" in \"A Doll's House\" and \"Ghosts\" qualifies those works as problem plays. Shaw distinguishes between the problem play and literature with conflicts reflecting a more universal view of the human condition. Works whose fundamental conflict does not pit human against institution, he argues, are more apt to remain relevant through generations. He cites \"Hamlet\", \"Faust\", and \"Les Misérables\" as examples of stories whose conflicts involve more eternal human questions. Shaw observes that the immediacy of the institutional question addressed in a problem play will render the play \"flat as ditchwater\" once society progresses and the issue is resolved. Although Ibsen was hailed by feminists, he did not regard himself as an advocate for any particular group.\n\nIbsen's aim, according to Raymond Williams, was to express tragedies in the human condition. Ibsen qualifies a human tragedy as the state \"[when a person] stands in a tight place; he cannot go forwards or backwards.” Williams also cites the specific characteristic that distinguishes his and Ibsen's modern drama from the preceding well-made formula. The well-made formula, Shaw observes, can be divided into three sections: Exposition, Situation, Unraveling. The plays of Ibsen and Shaw, Shaw himself asserts, do not end with a classic unraveling. Their work can be divided as: Exposition, Situation, Discussion.\n\nOscar Wilde's \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" exaggerates many of the conventions of the well-made play, such as the missing papers conceit (the hero, as an infant, was confused with the manuscript of a novel) and a final revelation (which, in this play, occurs about thirty seconds before the final curtain).\n\nHenrik Ibsen's \"A Doll's House\" follows most of the conceits of the well-made play, but transcends the genre when, after incriminating papers are recovered, Nora rejects the expected return to normality. Several of Ibsen's subsequent plays build on the general construction principles of the well-made play. \"The Wild Duck\" (1884) can be seen as a deliberate, meta-theatrical deconstruction of the Scribean formula. Ibsen sought a compromise between Naturalism and the well-made play which was fraught with difficulties since life does not fall easily into either form.\n\nAlthough George Bernard Shaw scorned the \"well-made play\", he accepted the form, and even thrived by it, for it concentrated his skills on the conversation among characters, his greatest asset as a dramatist. Other classic twists on the well-made play can be seen in his use of the General's coat and the hidden photograph in \"Arms and the Man\".\n\nAlso, J. B. Priestley's 1946 \"An Inspector Calls\" may in some ways be considered a \"well-made play\" in that its action happens before the play starts, and in the case of the older Birlings no moral change takes place. The similarity between Priestley's play and this rather conservative genre might strike some readers/audiences as surprising because Priestley was a socialist. However, his play, like Ibsen's \"A Doll's House\" transcends this genre by providing another plunge into chaos after the return to normality. He replaced the dramatic full stop with a question mark by revealing in the last scene that the 'inspector' who has exposed the complicity of a prosperous industrial family in the murder or suicide of a working-class girl, is not an inspector at all (perhaps a practical joker, an emanation of the world to come, or a manifestation of the world to come), and the curtain falls on the news that a real girl has died and a real inspector is on the way.\n\nThe techniques of well-made plays also lend themselves to comedies of situation, often farce. In \"The Quintessence of Ibsenism\", Bernard Shaw proposed that Ibsen converted this formula for use in \"serious\" plays by substituting discussion for the plausible dénouement or conclusion. Thus, plays become open-ended, as if there were life for the protagonists beyond the last act curtain.\n\n\n"}
