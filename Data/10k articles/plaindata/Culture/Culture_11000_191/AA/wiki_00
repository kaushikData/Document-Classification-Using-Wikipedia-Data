Eighty-eight people were killed as a result of the attacks, the majority of them Egyptians, and over 200 were injured, making the attack the deadliest terrorist action in Egypt's history, until it was surpassed by the 2017 Sinai attack.\n\nThe attack took place on Egypt's Revolution Day, a public holiday in Egypt, and was part of a strategy of hurting Egypt's economy by disrupting tourism, a major industry.\n\nAfter the attacks, many arrests took place, especially of the Bedouin in the Sinai, who allegedly aided the attack, and Egypt started erecting a separation barrier around the city, cutting it off from possible attacks and the nearby Bedouin community.\n\nHistorically, foreign tourists have been a common target of attacks since the early 1990s. Militants have typically been motivated by a combination of Qutbism and opposition to the Mubarak government, and attacking foreigners including non-Muslims while hurting Egypt's tourist trade was seen as serving both goals.\n\nThe most bloody attack prior to the Sharm El Sheikh attacks was the November 1997 Luxor massacre, in which 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians died. The 2004 Sinai bombings killed 34 people in October in Taba, also on the Sinai Peninsula. In the April 2005 Cairo terrorist attacks three foreign tourists were killed.\n\nUnlike the October 2004 Taba attacks, the Sharm El Sheikh attack does not appear to have been directed in particular against Israelis, for whom Sharm is a popular destination. However, one Israeli Arab was killed and another was injured.\n\nThe attacks took place in the early morning, at a time when many tourists and locals were still out at restaurants, cafés and bars. The first bomb blast took place at 1:15 am Egypt summer time (22:15 UTC) at the Old Market bazaar in downtown Sharm El Sheikh, killing 17 people, mostly Egyptians. The bomber had to abandon his truck bomb in the market because of a police roadblock. The second bomb was a truck bomb that was driven into the lobby of the Ghazala Gardens hotel, a 176-room four-star establishment in the Naama Bay area, a strip of beachfront hotels some 6 km from the town centre. About 45 people died in the blast. The final bomb was hidden in a suitcase and exploded outside the Moevenpick Hotel, killing six tourists.\n\nThe blasts were powerful, shaking windows miles away. Fire and smoke could be seen rising from the explosion sites.\n\nThe official government toll a few days after the attacks was put at 64, but hospitals reported that 88 people had been killed. The majority of dead and injured were Egyptians. Among those killed were 11 Britons, two Germans, six Italians, four Turks, one Czech, one Israeli, and one American. Other casualties, dead and injured, included foreign visitors from France, Kuwait, the Netherlands, Qatar, Russia, and Spain.\n\nA group calling itself the Abdullah Azzam Brigades was the first to claim responsibility for the attacks. On a website the group stated that \"holy warriors targeted the Ghazala Gardens hotel and the Old Market in Sharm El Sheikh\" and claimed it has ties to Al-Qaeda.\n\nThe Egyptian government said that the bombers were Bedouin militants from the same group that carried out the 2004 Sinai bombings in Taba. Arrested suspects claimed to have been motivated by the War in Iraq.\n\n\n"}

Our culture is West Indian since, in the course of history, it has brought together and combined in an original syncretism all these elements derived from the four corners of the earth, without being any one of those elements in particular.\"\n\nOriginally intended as a counter to the doctrine of Négritude, and its stress on an African rather than Caribbean identity, Antillanité was positively received by a number of prominent Martinican intellectuals, in particular the Groupe de Recherches de l'Institut Martiniquais d'Etudes headed by Édouard Glissant, which published the results of its discussions on Caribbean identity in the short-lived journal \"Acoma\" (1971–73).\n\nLike its predecessor, Négritude, Antillanité is, at its base, an assertion of the difference in the face of the encroachments of the same. The whole of Glissant's theoretical work may be seen as a sustained polemic, conducted in the name of \"le Divers,\" (the different) against the claims of the universal, to which a succession of derogatory epithets are attached in a more or less routine fashion.\n\nFor Glissant, \"the preoccupation with the universal is the alienated reverse side of the uniquely western pretension to exercise universal control\", and it therefore follows that proponents of Antillanité must adopt a \"firm opposition to any ideology of universal culture.\" Where Antillanité differs most markedly from Négritude is in its conception of the constitution of the different. For Négritude, the different was monolithic, being essentially African in character; however, in the view of Glissant, the different is, itself, diverse, complex, and heterogeneous, made up of a multiplicity of relations held in place by a complex process of attraction and repulsion. Thus, it could be said that while Négritude looked inwards, to African heritage, for its models and values Antillanité looked both inwards, and outwards, towards the Caribbean and Meso-America as a whole, in its quest for self-invention from which proponents conceived identity as an archipelago of signifiers, none of which enjoys primacy over the others and whose unity lies not in the fact of possessing a single source but, rather, in the complex amalgamation of these myriad forces which hold themselves in relation to each other. One of the major advances made by Antillanité is that it has, in large measure, shed the regressive, matrocentric orientation common to both assimilationism and Négritude.\n\nSuzanne Césaire\n\n"}

{"id": "1204311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1204311", "title": "Autopen", "text": "Autopen\n\nAn autopen or signing machine is a device used for the automatic signing of a signature or autograph. Many celebrities, politicians and public figures receive hundreds of letters a day, many of which request a personal reply; this leads to a situation in which either the individual must artificially reproduce their signature or heavily limit the number of recipients who receive a personal response. Given the exact verisimilitude to the real hand signature, the use of the autopen allows for a small degree of wishful thinking and plausible deniability as to whether a famous autograph is real or reproduced, thus increasing the perception of the personal value of the signature by the lay recipient. However, known or suspected autopen signatures are also vastly less valuable as philographic collectibles; legitimate hand-signed documents from individuals known to also use an autopen usually require verification and provenance to be considered valid.\n\nThe early autopens used a plastic matrix of the original signature which is a channel cut into an engraved plate in the shape of a wheel. A stylus driven by an electric motor followed the x and y axis of a profile or shape engraved in the plate (which is why it is called a matrix). The stylus is mechanically connected to an arm which can hold almost any common writing instrument, so the favourite pen and ink can be used to suggest authenticity. The Autopen signature is made with even pressure (and indentation in the paper), which is how these machines are distinguishable from original handwriting where the pressure varies.\n\nModern day autopens use a signature smart card or USB flash drive to store signatures and phrases instead of the plastic matrices. In addition, certain models can replicate entire pages of writing once a custom font has been created in a user's handwriting.\n\nThe first signature duplicating machines were developed by an Englishman named John Isaac Hawkins. Hawkins received a United States patent for his device in 1803. In 1804, Thomas Jefferson began using the device extensively. This early device was known at the time as a polygraph (an abstracted version of the pantograph) and bears little resemblance to today's autopens in design or operation. The autopen called the Robot Pen was developed in the 1930s, and became commercially available in 1937 (used as a storage unit device, similar in principle to how vinyl records store information) to record a signer's signature. A small segment of the record could be removed and stored elsewhere to prevent misuse. The machine would then be able to mass-produce a template signature when needed.\n\nWhile the Robot Pen was commercially available, the first commercially successful autopen was developed by Robert M. De Shazo, Jr., in 1942. De Shazo developed the technology that became the modern autopen in reference to a Request For Quote (RFQ) from the Navy, and in 1942, received an order for the machine from the Secretary of the Navy. This was the beginning of a significant market in government for the autopen, as the machines soon ended up in the offices of members of Congress, the Senate and the Executive branches. At one point, De Shazo estimated there were more than 500 autopens in use in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. Justice Department issued a legal opinion upholding the right of the U.S. President to sign bills by autopen.\n\nConfidentiality is extremely important to autopen owners and most will not divulge whether they own one or not. Some say Harry Truman was the first United States President to use the Autopen as a way of responding to mail and signing checks. Others credit Gerald Ford as the first President to openly acknowledge his use of the Autopen, but Lyndon Johnson allowed photographs of his autopen to be taken while he was in office, and in 1968 the \"National Enquirer\" ran them along with the front-page headline \"The Robot That Sits In For The President.\" \n\nAutopen devices are used today by politicians and fundraisers to sign letters to constituents written by administrative assistants and clerical staff, and by other famous people to sign autographs.\n\nWhile visiting France, US President Barack Obama authorized the use of an autopen to create his signature which signed into law an extension of three provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. On January 3, 2013, he signed the extension to the Bush tax cuts, using the Autopen while vacationing in Hawaii. In order to sign it by the required deadline, his other alternative would have been to have had the bill flown to him overnight. Republican leaders have questioned whether this use of the Autopen meets the Constitutional requirement for signing a bill into law, but the validity of presidential use of an autopen has not been actually tested in court. During his term in office, President George W. Bush asked for and received a favorable opinion from the Department of Justice regarding the constitutionality of using the autopen, but did not use it himself.\n\nFurther developing the class of devices known as autopens, Canadian author Margaret Atwood created a device called the Longpen, which allows audio and video conversation between the fan and author while a book is being signed remotely.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29541453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29541453", "title": "Bedsitcom", "text": "Bedsitcom\n\nBedsitcom is a British reality television hoax series that was broadcast on Channel 4 in December 2003. Pitched as \"somewhere between a sitcom and a reality TV show\", the show documented the lives of six young people living in a loft flat in London. Its hook was that its TV audience was aware that three of the participants—named Mel, Paul and Rufus—were actually actors being directed by a trio of \"writers\" in a garage on the ground floor.\n\n\"Bedsitcom\" was commissioned by the Channel Four Television Corporation and produced by Objective Productions. Producers auditioned thousands of people to be the show's genuine subjects and selected from them six young adults to live in the flat with the three actors. These six participants were told that they would be starring in a new reality TV series called \"Making Friends\", and featured on the show three at a time over a period of eight weeks. The programme ran for a single series of eight episodes and featured various storylines, involving dead goldfish, dodgy dealings, promiscuous mothers and telephone psychics.\n\nThe show received largely negative feedback from television reviewers, who criticised the show's premise as a \"deeply offensive\" idea. It received a viewership peak of 1.2 million with its final episode, giving it an audience share of 8.9 per cent. \"Bedsitcom\" was not recommissioned for a second series and is currently not available either on DVD or on Channel 4's on demand service, 4oD.\n\n\"Bedsitcom\" was created by Peter James and Andrew O'Connor, and was conceived as a parody of both reality television and the traditional sitcom. It combined these two elements by featuring three members of the public being unknowingly placed in extraordinary situations by three actors being directed by writers. After being commissioned for Channel 4 by Danielle Lux, \"Bedsitcom\" was produced by Matt Crook and Kirsty Smith of Objective Productions.\n\nThe show was pitched as \"somewhere between a sitcom and a reality TV show\" and was promoted as \"an entirely new genre of television programme\". Its title is a portmanteau of the words \"bedsit\"—a British term referring to a form of rented accommodation consisting of a single room and shared bathroom—and \"sitcom\". The title is technically a misnomer: as the accommodation's bedroom and sitting area were separate, it was not a bedsit.\n\nMelanie Ash, Paul Gibbon and Rufus Jones were selected as the three actors to feature in \"Bedsitcom\". Jones had previously portrayed the part of Crispin in the 2002 drama \"White Teeth\"; Gibbon had played the lead role of Link in the series \"Stone Cold\". To avoid breaking character, all three used their real names while living in the flat and went through weeks of rehearsals. O'Connor described the entire process as \"exhausting\".\n\nTo find suitable candidates to live with the three actors, producers auditioned roughly 10,000 people, who were told that they would be taking part in a new reality television programme in London called \"Making Friends\". Six members of the public, named Barrington, Bob, Dave, David, Jessica and Shirine, were selected to feature on the show.\n\nThe plots for \"Bedsitcom\" were devised by a team of writers (led by Rob Gibbons, Neil Gibbons and producer Matt Crook) located in a garage on the ground floor of the apartment building that the contestants were staying in. The writers would often appear on screen and explain to the TV audience what their intention for each episode was. They communicated with Ash, Gibbon and Jones either by ringing them on their mobile phones, or by calling them downstairs to speak to them in person. They would occasionally change their plans for an episode—in \"Worst Case Scenario\", for example, the writers altered their storyline from having Mel bring various animals into the flat to having the group kill Mel's goldfish after only one night.\n\nAmong the team of writers were Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, who had created the Channel 4 sitcom \"Peep Show\" with O'Connor earlier that year, plus Rob Gibbons and Neil Gibbons. Filming of \"Bedsitcom\" began in May 2003 and lasted for approximately eight weeks. The flatmates were filmed for 12 hours a day, with this footage then being edited down to roughly 25 minutes per week of filming.\n\n\"Bedsitcom\" documented the lives of six young adults living in a loft flat in London. Eight episodes in total were created, which were divided into two distinct halves. The first four episodes centred on the lives of Mel, Paul and Rufus, the three actors, as they lived in the flat with Bob, Dave and Shirine, the three unaware members of the public who believed they were taking part in a genuine reality TV show. After Bob, Dave and Shirine had learnt the true nature of the show at the end of episode four, they moved out and were replaced by three new members of the public named Barrington, David and Jessica. These three new cast members remained on \"Bedsitcom\" for the final four episodes.\n\nReviewers gave \"Bedsitcom\" generally negative feedback. Some were critical of the storylines that had been devised by the writers, calling them unimaginative and clichéd. Others were critical of the premise of the show itself, describing it as \"deeply offensive and manipulative\" and \"morally reprehensible\"—all three actors, particularly Jones, received criticism for their acting abilities. Frances Traynor of \"The Daily Record\" called the show \"about as funny as sharing a flat with that German cannibal\" and Paddy Sherman of \"The Liverpool Echo\" branded the show \"intensely irritating\". Paul Hoggart of \"The Times\" called it \"a show that seemed to have nothing to recommend it whatsoever\",—after watching the first episode, Charlie Catchpole of \"The Daily Star\" simply stated: \"It isn't funny.\" Critics on \"Newsnight Review\" also spoke harshly about the programme, with Tom Paulin calling it \"a disgraceful piece of television\" and Jeanette Winterson describing it as \"incredibly dull\".\nA slightly more positive review came from Joe Joseph of \"The Times\", who suggested that \"if [the format] works, [it] could be profitably franchised around the world\". Deborah Bull said that, while it was \"a terrible programme\", there were \"some funny lines\". Chris Wilson, editor of Collective, similarly wrote that \"while the end results are often amusing and tackle some interesting storylines, the whole project smacks of lazy, cruel television\".\n\nIn a 2005 interview, series creator Andrew O'Connor spoke about \"Bedsitcom\" and the critical reaction that it had received. He said that he felt that the premise of the show was a \"great idea\", but that it did not make \"great television\". He also remarked: \"We didn't cast it right and the public didn't take to the series.\"\n\nGiven the level of exposure and promotion that it had been granted, Channel Four were disappointed by ratings for \"Bedsitcom\". The pilot, shown on 8 December 2003, generated 1 million viewers, but this figure had fallen to 700,000 by 10 December. The ratings rose to 1.1 million viewers for the fourth episode, \"Fag Ends\". On average, the series attracted an audience share of less than 6 per cent. The final episode, \"P.I.G\", gained a viewership of 1.2 million with a market share of 8.9 per cent, which was its highest audience for the series. \"Bedsitcom\" was nominated for a single award at the 2004 Rose d'Or festival, a European awards show that commemorates achievement in entertainment television. The programme was submitted in the Best Situation Comedy category, but was beaten by \"Peep Show\".\n\"Bedsitcom\" was distributed by the Channel Four Television Corporation, who broadcast the show on its eponymous channel. It premiered in the UK at 10:40 p.m. on 8 December 2003. Bedsitcom's eight episodes were 'stripped' over two weeks: the first four were broadcast nightly until 11 December and the remaining four were shown each night from 15 December. There are currently no plans to revive the series, and it is not available either on DVD or on 4oD, Channel 4's on demand service.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9660402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9660402", "title": "Blackout (drug-related amnesia)", "text": "Blackout (drug-related amnesia)\n\nA drug-related blackout is a phenomenon caused by the intake of any substance or medication in which short-term and long-term memory creation is impaired, therefore causing a complete inability to recall the past. Blackouts are most frequently associated with GABAergic drugs. Blackouts are frequently described as having effects similar to that of anterograde amnesia, in which the subject cannot recall any events after the event that caused amnesia.\n\nResearch on alcohol blackouts was done by E. M. Jellinek in the 1940s. Using data from a survey of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) members, he came to believe that blackouts would be a good determinant of alcoholism. However, there are conflicting views whether this is true. The negative psychological effects of an alcohol-related blackout are often worsened by those who suffer from anxiety disorders. Impairment of the liver will also allow more alcohol to reach the brain and hasten the individual's blackout.\n\nThe term \"blackout\" can also refer to a complete loss of consciousness, or syncope.\n\nVarious studies have also given rise to proof of links between general alcohol consumption and its effects on memory capacity. These studies have shown in particular, how the inebriated or intoxicated individual makes poorer associations between words and objects than does the sober individual. Later blackout-specific studies have indicated that alcohol specifically impairs the brain's ability to take short-term memories and experiences and transfer them to long-term memory.\n\nIt is a common misconception that blackouts generally occur only in alcoholics; research suggests that individuals who engage in binge drinking, such as many college students, are often at risk as well. In a 2002 survey of college students by researchers at Duke University Medical Center, 40% of those surveyed who had consumed alcohol recently reported having experienced a blackout within the preceding year.\n\nIn one study, a sample of individuals was gathered and divided into groups based on whether they had a fragmentary blackout within the last year or not. Groups were also divided based on those who had received alcohol and those who had not. In their beverage challenge, participants were given one drink per ten minutes until the target of .08%BAC was achieved. Drinks for the alcohol condition contained a 3:1 ratio of mixer to vodka. After 30 minutes, breathalyzer samples were recorded and recorded every 30 minutes thereafter. In the test for narrative recall those who received alcohol and FB+(those who admitted to having a fragmentary blackout within the last year) recalled fewer narrative details after a 30-minute delay, but there were no significant interaction effects. The next day participants were called and tested on their narrative recall and cued recall and the results were that those who consumed alcohol showed poorer 30-minute delay recall and next-day recall than those who did not consume alcohol, but there were no significant effects on cued recall of details. Their study also revealed that those who were FB+ and consumed alcohol also performed worse on contextual recall than the other participants.\n\nAlcohol impairs delayed and next-day narrative recall, but not next-day cued recall which suggests that information is available in memory but is temporarily inaccessible. Those with a history of fragmentary blackouts also performed worse on delayed recall than those with no prior blackouts. Neuroimaging shows that cued recall and free recall are associated with differential neural activation in distinct neural networks: sensory and conceptual. Together, these findings suggest that the differential effects of alcohol on free and cued recalls may be a result of substance altering neural activity in conceptual rather than sensory networks. Prior blackout experiences also appear to be related to impaired conceptual networks.\n\nBlackouts can generally be divided into 2 categories, \"en bloc\" blackouts and \"fragmentary\" blackouts. En bloc blackouts are classified by the inability to later recall any memories from the intoxication period, even when prompted. These blackouts are characterized also by the ability to easily recall things that have occurred within the last 2 minutes, yet being unable to recall anything prior to this period. As such, a person experiencing an en bloc blackout may not appear to be doing so, as they can carry on conversations or even manage to accomplish difficult feats. It is difficult to determine the end of this type of blackout as sleep typically occurs before they end, although it is possible for an en bloc blackout to end if the sufferer has stopped drinking in the meantime. Fragmentary blackouts are characterized by a person having the ability to recall certain events from an intoxicated period, and yet being unaware that other memories are missing until reminded of the existence of those 'gaps' in memory. Research indicates that such fragmentary blackouts, also known as brownouts, are far more common than en bloc blackouts. Memory impairment during acute intoxication involves dysfunction of episodic memory, a type of memory encoded with spatial and social context. Recent studies have shown that there are multiple memory systems supported by discrete brain regions, and the acute effects of alcohol and learning and memory may result from alteration of the hippocampus and related structures on a cellular level. A rapid increase in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is most consistently associated with the likelihood of a blackout. However, not all subjects experience blackouts which implies that genetic factors play a role in determining central nervous system (CNS) vulnerability to the effects of alcohol. The former may predispose an individual to alcoholism, as altered memory function during intoxication may affect an individual’s alcohol expectancy, one may perceive positive aspects of intoxication while unintentionally ignoring the negative aspects.\n\nBlackouts are commonly associated with the consumption of large amounts of alcohol; however, surveys of drinkers experiencing blackouts have indicated that they are not directly related to the amount of alcohol consumed. Respondents reported they frequently recalled having \"drunk as much or more without memory loss,\" compared to instances of blacking out. Subsequent research has indicated that blackouts are most likely caused by a rapid increase in a person's blood-alcohol concentration. One study, in particular, resulted in subjects being stratified easily into two groups, those who consumed alcohol very quickly, and blacked out, and those who did not black out by drinking alcohol slowly, despite being extremely intoxicated by the end of the study.\n\nIn another study hospital file data showed, that of 67 participants, 39 had reported a blackout. The presence or absence of blackouts was cross-tabulated against various measures of alcohol problem severity. The presence of blackouts was associated to some degree with some indications of severity such as withdrawal and loss of control, but not with duration of problem drinking, physical complications or abnormal liver function.\n\nThe presence of blackouts was related to some measures of severity of the problem – withdrawal symptoms and loss of control. The hypotheses that blackouts either reflect a general vulnerability to the cerebral consequences of alcohol abuse or are associated with other forms of more enduring cognitive impairment did not receive any support.\n\nIn another study which looked at subjective responses to alcohol as a prime for 21st birthday alcohol consumption, subjective responses to the initial drink were viewed as a prime for more alcohol consumption during 21st birthday celebrations. Current findings show that subjective responses to alcohol have direct effects on both the final BAC achieved and on the experiences of blackouts and hangover that are not explained by level of intoxication. Where a variety of social factors, such as peer pressure and 21st birthday traditions such as 21 shots may influence the amount of alcohol people consume, their subjective experiences with alcohol have clear influences on both consumption and the physiological consequences of drinking. These physiological responses to alcohol may have a biological vulnerability that extends beyond the dose-dependent effects of alcohol.\n\nSelf reports from another study showed that 63% of patients in the study gulped their drinks rather than sipped. Five patients recollected vomiting during the drinking episode while 32 drank on an empty stomach and 41 drank more than originally planned. During the drinking episode 31% subjects described blackouts, 20% described brownouts, and 49% reported no amnesic episode.\n\nMemory disruptions by alcohol leading to blackout have been linked to inhibition of long-term potentiation, particularly in the hippocampus, by affecting gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate neurotransmission (\"see Effects of alcohol on memory\").\n\nAlcohol induced blackouts are associated with the development of alcohol abuse and dependence, so it is important to consider potential neurobiological risk factors for experiencing this problem prior to onset of substance use. Results showed that prior to beginning substance use, blackout and youth showed greater activation during inhibitory processing than nondrinkers and blackout – youth in frontal and cerebellar brain regions. Activation during correct inhibitory responses relative to go responses in the left and middle frontal gyri at baseline predicted future blackout experience, after controlling for follow-up externalizing behaviors and lifetime alcohol consumption. The conclusion of this study was that substance-naïve adolescents who later experience alcohol-induced blackouts show increased neural effort during inhibitory processing, as compared to adolescents who go on to drink at similar levels, but do not experience blackouts and healthy, nondrinking controls, suggesting a neurobiological vulnerability to alcohol-induced memory impairments.\n\nAlcohol acts as an agonist of the GABA type receptor, leading to memory disruption (\"see Effects of alcohol on memory\"). Benzodiazepines (such as flunitrazepam, midazolam, and temazepam), barbiturates (such as phenobarbital), and other drugs which also act as GABA agonists, are known to cause blackouts as a result of high dose use.\n\nResearch indicates that some users of alcohol, particularly those with a history of blackouts, are predisposed to experience blackouts more frequently than others. One such study indicated a link between prenatal exposure to alcohol and vulnerability towards blackouts, in addition to the oft-cited link between this type of exposure and alcoholism. Alternatively, another study has indicated that there appears to be a genetic predisposition towards blacking out, suggesting that some individuals are made to be susceptible to alcohol-related amnesia.\n\nFrom a neurobiological perspective, central serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neurotransmission has been shown to modulate both alcohol consumption and impulsivity. Some variations in 5-HT neurotransmission may thus contribute to a risk of AD (alcohol dependence), especially the forms of AD associated with a high level of impulsivity 2.\n\nAs the extracellular concentration of 5-HT is regulated by the activity of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), the gene SLC6A4 encoding this protein represents an important potential candidate gene for AD risk. Using a meta-analysis approach, Feinn et al. found evidence for an association of the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR (SLC6A4) with AD, but the overall effect size estimated by odd ratios was found weak. As expected in a complex condition like alcohol dependence, the disagreement in the association between AD and 5-HTTLPR likely reflects the impossibility for a single genetic determinant to explain the whole of the risk.\n\nAside from chemical components which may cause a predisposition to alcohol dependence and blackouts, expectations of alcohol use may predispose drinkers toward alcoholism and blackouts. In a study of 123 college students significant correlations were found between students’ alcohol expectancies, level of alcohol abuse, and blackout history. The students who experienced blackouts (38.6%) had much higher positive alcohol expectancies than those without blackouts. Positive and negative expectancies were positively correlated among the no-blackout group, but negatively correlated among the blackout group.\n\nAlcohol dependence is not prerequisite to blackouts (either en bloc or fragmentary). Students in one study who reported blackouts were demographically similar to other drinking students. Importantly, however, students reporting blackouts drank more, and had other symptoms of alcoholic drinking, even though they did not fall into the alcoholic range on the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST). Half of the students reported having had a blackout during their drinking careers, which closely followed other research findings.\n\nIn another study 25% of healthy college students reported being familiar with alcoholic blackouts. 51% of the students reported that they had had at least one blackout. Blackouts were reported during activities such as spending money (27%), sexual conduct (24%), fighting (16%), vandalism (16%), unprotected intercourse (6%), and driving a car (3%). So a significant number of students were engaged in a range of possibly hazardous activities during blackouts.\n\nOf 545 individuals in another study, 161 (29.5%) reported driving drunk, 139 (25.5%) reported a regretted sexual situation, 67 (12.3%) reported unprotected sex, 60 (11%) reported having damaged property, 55 (10.1%) reported getting into a physical fight, and 29 (5.3%) reported injuring someone while under the influence of alcohol in the past 6 months.\n"}

Their blood was supposed to appease the infernal gods, and render them propitious to the remains of the deceased. In later ages, this custom appeared too barbarous; and in lieu of these victims, they appointed gladiators to fight, whose blood, it was supposed, might have the same effect.\n\nAccording to Valerius Maximus and Florus, Marcus and Decimus, sons of Brutus, were the first, at Rome, who honored the funerals of their father with spectacles of this kind, in the year of Rome 489. Some authors in the previous century claimed that the Romans borrowed this custom from the Etrurians, though the evidence now points to Campania, and to a campanian influence and thus to a Greek borrowing since the Greeks settled in Campania since the eighth century BC.\n"}

{"id": "403097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=403097", "title": "Culture of Argentina", "text": "Culture of Argentina\n\nThe culture of Argentina is as varied as the country's geography and is composed of a mix of ethnic groups. Modern Argentine culture has been largely influenced by Italian, Spanish and other European immigration, although there are lesser elements of Amerindian and African influences, particularly in the fields of music and art. Buenos Aires, its cultural capital, is largely characterized by both the prevalence of people of European descent, and of conscious imitation of European styles in architecture. Museums, cinemas, and galleries are abundant in all the large urban centers, as well as traditional establishments such as literary bars, or bars offering live music of a variety of genres.\n\nArgentine writer Ernesto Sabato reflected on the nature of the culture of Argentina as follows:\nThe spoken languages of Argentina number at least 40, although Spanish is dominant. Others include native and other immigrant languages; some languages are extinct and others are endangered, spoken by elderly people whose descendants do not speak the languages.\n\nThe most prevalent dialect is \"Rioplatense\", also known as \"Argentine Spanish\", whose speakers are located primarily in the basin of the Río de la Plata. Argentines are amongst the few Spanish-speaking countries (like Uruguay, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras) that almost universally use what is known as \"voseo\" — the use of the pronoun \"vos\" instead of \"tú\" (Spanish for \"you\").\n\nIn many of the central and north-eastern areas of the country, the “rolling r” takes on the same sound as the ll and y ('zh' - a voiced palatal fricative sound, similar to the \"s\" in the English pronunciation of the word \"vision\").\n\nSouth Bolivian Quechua is a Quechuan language spoken by some 800,000 people, mostly immigrants who have arrived in the last years. There are 70,000 estimated speakers in Salta Province. The language is also known as Central Bolivian Quechua, which has six dialects. It is classified as a Quechua II language, and is referred to as Quechua IIC by linguists.\n\nGuaraní is also spoken, mainly in the Mesopotamia, and is an official language in the province of Corrientes.\n\nArgentina has a detailed literary history, as well as one of the region's most active publishing industries. Argentine writers have figured prominently in Latin American literature, since becoming a fully united entity in the 1850s, with a strong constitution and a defined nation-building plan. The struggle between the Federalists (who favored a loose confederation of provinces based on rural conservatism) and the Unitarians (pro-liberalism and advocates of a strong central government that would encourage European immigration), set the tone for Argentine literature of the time.\n\nThe ideological divide between gaucho epic \"Martín Fierro\" by José Hernández, and \"Facundo\" by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, is a great example. Hernández, a federalist, was opposed to the centralizing, modernizing, and Europeanizing tendencies. Sarmiento wrote in support of immigration as the only way to save Argentina from becoming subject to the rule of a small number of dictatorial \"caudillo\" families, arguing such immigrants would make Argentina more modern and open to Western European influences, and therefore a more prosperous society.\n\nArgentine literature of that period was fiercely nationalist. It was followed by the modernist movement, which emerged in France in the late 19th century, and this period in turn was followed by vanguardism, with Ricardo Güiraldes as an important reference. Jorge Luis Borges, its most acclaimed writer, found new ways of looking at the modern world in metaphor and philosophical debate, and his influence has extended to writers all over the globe. Borges is most famous for his works in short stories, such as \"Ficciones\" and \"The Aleph\".\n\nSome of the nation's notable writers, poets, and intellectuals include: Juan Bautista Alberdi, Jorge Luis Borges, Roberto Arlt, Enrique Banchs, Adolfo Bioy Casares, Silvina Bullrich, Eugenio Cambaceres, Julio Cortázar, Esteban Echeverría, Leopoldo Lugones, Eduardo Mallea, Ezequiel Martínez Estrada, Tomás Eloy Martínez, Victoria Ocampo, Manuel Puig, Ernesto Sabato, Osvaldo Soriano, Alfonsina Storni, María Elena Walsh and Oliverio Girondo.\n\nArgentine painters and sculptors have a rich history, dating from both before and since the development of modern Argentina in the second half of the 19th century. Artistic production did not truly come into its own, until after the 1852 overthrow of the repressive regime of Juan Manuel de Rosas. Immigrants like Eduardo Schiaffino, Eduardo Sívori, Reynaldo Giudici, Emilio Caraffa, and Ernesto de la Cárcova left behind a realist heritage influential to this day.\n\nImpressionism did not make itself evident among Argentine artists until after 1900, however, and never acquired the kind of following it did in Europe, though it did inspire influential Argentine post-impressionists such as Martín Malharro, Ramón Silva, Cleto Ciocchini, Fernando Fader, Pío Collivadino, Cesáreo Bernaldo de Quirós, Realism, and aestheticism continued to set the agenda in Argentine painting and sculpture, noteworthy during this era for the sudden fame of sculptor Lola Mora, a student of Auguste Rodin's.\n\nAs Lola Mora had been until she fell out of favor with local high society, monumental sculptors became in very high demand after 1900, particularly by municipal governments and wealthy families, who competed with each other in boasting the most evocative mausolea for their dearly departed. Though most preferred French and Italian sculptors, work by locals Erminio Blotta, Ángel María de Rosa, and Rogelio Yrurtia resulted in a proliferation of soulful monuments and memorials made them immortal. Not as realist as the work of some of his \"belle-époque\" predecessors in sculpture, Yrurtia's subtle impressionism inspired Argentine students like Antonio Pujía, whose internationally prized female torsos always surprise admirers with their whimsical and surreal touches, while Pablo Curatella Manes' sculptures drew from cubism.\n\nBecoming an intellectual, as well as artistic circle, painters like Antonio Berni, Lino Enea Spilimbergo, and Juan Carlos Castagnino were friends as well as colleagues, going on to collaborate on masterpieces like the ceiling at the \"Galerias Pacifico\" arcade in Buenos Aires, towards 1933.\n\nAs in Mexico and elsewhere, muralism became increasingly popular among Argentine artists. Among the first to use his drab surroundings as a canvas was Benito Quinquela Martín, whose vaguely cubist pastel-colored walls painted in his Buenos Aires neighborhood of La Boca during the 1920s and 1930s, have become historical monuments and Argentine cultural emblems, worldwide. Lithographs, likewise, found a following in Argentina sometime after they had been made popular elsewhere. In Argentina, artists like Adolfo Bellocq, used this medium to portray often harsh working conditions in Argentina's growing industrial sector, during the 1920s and 1930s. Antonio Seguí, another lithographer, transferred his naïve style into murals in numerous nations, as did Ricardo Carpani, though in a realist style.\n\nThe vanguard in culturally conservative Argentina, futurists and cubists like Xul Solar and Emilio Pettoruti earned a following as considerable as that of less abstract and more sentimental portrait and landscape painters, like Raúl Soldi. Likewise, traditional abstract artists such as Romulo Macció, Anselmo Piccoli, Eduardo Mac Entyre, Luis Felipe Noé, and Luis Seoane co-existed with equal appeal as the most conceptual mobile art creators such as the unpredictable Pérez Celis, Gyula Kosice of the Argentine Madí Movement, and Marta Minujín, one of Andy Warhol's most esteemed fellow Conceptual artists.\n\nThe emergence of avant-garde genres in Argentine sculpture also featured Pablo Curatella Manes and Roberto Aizenberg, and constructivists such as Nicolás García Uriburu and Leon Ferrari, one of the world's foremost artists in his genre, today. In the 1960s and 1970s, many of these figures' abstract art found their way into popular advertising and even corporate logos.\n\nGenerally possessing a strong sentimental streak, the Argentine public's taste for naïve art and simple pottery cannot be overlooked. Since Prilidiano Pueyrredón's day, artists in the naïve vein like Cándido López have captured the absurdity of war; Susana Aguirre, and Aniko Szabó, the idiosyncrasies of everyday neighborhoods; Guillermo Roux's watercolors, a circus atmosphere; and Gato Frías, childhood memories. Illustrator Florencio Molina Campos's tongue-in-cheek depictions of gaucho life have endured as collectors' items.\n\nTo help showcase Argentine and Latin American art and sculpture, local developer and art collector Eduardo Constantini set aside a significant portion of his personal collection, and in 1998, began construction on Buenos Aires' first major institution specializing in works by Latin American artists. His foundation opened the Buenos Aires Museum of Latin American Art (MALBA) in 2001.\n\nIn the 1920s, Buenos Aires was overflowing with creative drawings and design. Argentine illustrators and sketchers were attracting worldwide recognition, including artists such as Jose Freire Segundo, creator of gráfica of Aikal (1940); Jose Luis Salinas, called upon by King Features to create a comic strip of worldwide fame, \"Cisco Kid\"; and Florencio Molina Campos, the brilliant sketcher of the Alpargatas Almanacs of rural life (1930), who collaborated on three Walt Disney films.\n\nThe culmination was the arrival, in 1927, of French painter, poster artist and sculptor Lucien Achille Mauzan, who was part of the artistic Art Deco movement. He settled in Buenos Aires and founded his own company \"Editorial Affiches Mauzan\" (Editorial Mauzan Posters) and created between 130 and 150 posters in the six years he spent in Argentina. He marks deeply in the poster art in Argentina, where his reputation is enormous. One of his well-known works is the amicably tortured head of Geniol.\n\nIn the 1950s renowned Uruguayan-Argentine journalist, caricaturist Hermenegildo Sábat, portrayed political figures, as well as artists and other personalities. Many of his \"Argentine cultural icons\" are reproduced in ceramic tile in the Buenos Aires Underground.\n\nArgentine comics were living its \"Golden Age\" between the 1940s and the 1960s. Cartoonists and comic creators have contributed prominently to national culture, including Alberto Breccia, Dante Quinterno, Oski, Francisco Solano López, Horacio Altuna, Guillermo Mordillo, Roberto Fontanarrosa, whose grotesque characters captured life's absurdities with quick-witted commentary, and Quino, known for the soup-hating Mafalda, and her comic strip gang of childhood friends, the theorist Oscar Masotta synthesized its contributions in the development of their own models of action comics (Héctor Oesterheld, Hugo Pratt), humor comics (Divito, Quino) and folkloric comics (Walter Ciocca) and the presence of four great artists (José Luis Salinas, Arturo Pérez del Castillo, Hugo Pratt and Alberto Breccia).\n\nThe architecture of Argentina can be said to start at the beginning of the Spanish colonization, though it was in the 18th century that the cities of the country reached their splendour. Cities like Córdoba, Salta, Mendoza, and also Buenos Aires conserved most their historical Spanish colonial architecture in spite of their urban growth.\n\nThe simplicity of the \"Rioplatense\" baroque style can be clearly appreciated in Buenos Aires, in the works of Italian architects such as André Blanqui and Antonio Masella, in the churches of San Ignacio, Nuestra Señora del Pilar, the Cathedral, and the Cabildo.\n\nItalian and French influences increased after the war for independence at the beginning of the 19th century, though the academic style persisted until the first decades of the 20th century. Attempts at renovation took place during the second half of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, when the European tendencies penetrated into the country, reflected in numerous important buildings of Buenos Aires, such as the Santa Felicitam Church, by Ernesto Bunge; the Central Post Office and Palace of Justice, by Norbert Maillart; and the National Congress and the Colón Opera House, by Vittorio Meano.\n\nThe architecture of the second half of the 20th century continued adapting French neoclassical architecture, such as the headquarters of the National Bank of Argentina, and the NH Gran Hotel Provincial, built by Alejandro Bustillo, and the Museo de Arte Hispano Fernández Blanco, by Martín Noel.\n\nNumerous Argentine architects have enriched their own country's cityscapes, and in recent decades, those around the world. Juan Antonio Buschiazzo helped popularize Beaux-Arts architecture, and Francisco Gianotti combined Art Nouveau with Italianate styles, each adding flair to Argentine cities during the early 20th century. Francisco Salamone and Viktor Sulĉiĉ left an Art Deco legacy, and Alejandro Bustillo created a prolific body of Rationalist architecture. Clorindo Testa introduced Brutalist architecture locally, César Pelli's and Patricio Pouchulu's Futurist creations have graced cities, worldwide. Pelli's 1980s throwbacks to the Art Deco glory of the 1920s, in particular, made him one of the world's most prestigious architects.\n\nArgentina cities have varied architecture. Commonly each house has an individual design, and is very rare to find any tract housing neighborhood.\n\nThe Argentine film industry created around 170 full-length titles in 2012. The world's first animated feature films were made and released in Argentina, by cartoonist Quirino Cristiani, in 1917 and 1918. Argentine cinema enjoyed a 'golden age' in the 1930s through the 1950s with scores of productions, many now considered classics of Spanish-language film. The industry produced actors who became the first movie stars of Argentine cinema, often tango performers such as Libertad Lamarque, Floren Delbene, Tito Lusiardo, Tita Merello, Roberto Escalada, and Hugo del Carril.\n\nMore recent films from the \"New Wave\" of cinema since the 1980s have achieved worldwide recognition, such as \"The Official Story\" (Best foreign film oscar in 1986), \"Man Facing Southeast\", \"A Place in the World\", \"Nine Queens\", \"Son of the Bride\", \"The Motorcycle Diaries\", \"Blessed by Fire\", \"The Secret in Their Eyes\", winner of the 2009 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and \"Wild Tales\". Although rarely rivaling Hollywood productions in popularity, local films are released weekly, and widely followed in Argentina and internationally. A number of local films, many of which are low-budget productions, have earned prizes in cinema festivals (such as Cannes), and are promoted by events such as the Mar del Plata Film Festival and the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema.\n\nThe per capita number of screens is one of the highest in Latin America, and viewing per capita is the highest in the region. A new generation of Argentine directors have caught the attention of critics worldwide. Cinema is an important facet of local culture, as well as a popular pastime, and levels of cinema attendance are comparable to those of European countries. Argentine composers Luis Bacalov, Gustavo Santaolalla, and Eugenio Zanetti have been honored with Academy Award for Best Original Score nods. Lalo Schifrin has received numerous Grammys, and is best known for the \"\" theme.\n\n\"Tango\", the music and lyrics (often sung in a form of slang called \"lunfardo\"), is Argentina's musical symbol. The Milonga dance was a predecessor, slowly evolving into modern \"tango\". By the 1930s, tango had changed from a dance-focused music to one of lyric and poetry, with singers such as Carlos Gardel, Hugo del Carril, Roberto Goyeneche, Raúl Lavié, Tita Merello, and Edmundo Rivero. The golden age of tango (1930 to mid-1950s) mirrored that of jazz and swing in the United States, featuring large orchestral groups too, like the bands of Osvaldo Pugliese, Aníbal Troilo, Francisco Canaro, Julio de Caro, and Juan d'Arienzo. Incorporating acoustic music and later, synthesizers into the genre after 1955, \"bandoneón\" virtuoso Astor Piazzolla popularized \"new tango\" creating a more subtle, intellectual and listener-oriented trend. Today, tango enjoys worldwide popularity; ever-evolving, \"neo-tango\" is a global phenomenon with renowned groups like Tanghetto, Bajofondo, and the Gotan Project.\n\nArgentine rock, called \"rock nacional\", is the most popular music among the youth. Arguably the most listened-to form of Spanish-language rock, its influence and international success are owed to a rich, uninterrupted development. Bands such as Soda Stereo or Sumo, and composers like Charly García, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Fito Páez and Andrés Calamaro are referents of national culture. Mid-1960s Buenos Aires and Rosario were cradles of the music, and by 1970, Argentine rock was well established among middle class youth (see: Almendra, Sui Generis, Pappo, Crucis, Pescado Rabioso). Serú Girán bridged the gap into the 1980s, when Argentine bands became popular across Latin America and elsewhere (Enanitos Verdes, Fabulosos Cadillacs and Virus). There are many subgenres: underground, pop-oriented, and some associated with the working class (La Renga, Divididos, Hermética, V8 and Los Redonditos). Current popular bands include Babasónicos, Los Auténticos Decadentes, Rata Blanca, Horcas, Attaque 77, Bersuit, Los Piojos, Catupecu Machu, Carajo and Callejeros.\n\nEuropean classical music is well represented in Argentina. Buenos Aires is home to the world-renowned Colón Theater. Classical musicians, such as Martha Argerich, Eduardo Alonso-Crespo, Daniel Barenboim, Eduardo Delgado, and Alberto Lysy, and classical composers such as Juan José Castro and Alberto Ginastera, and contemporary composers such as Osvaldo Golijov, Gerardo Gandini, and Oscar Edelstein are internationally acclaimed. All major cities in Argentina have impressive theaters or opera houses, and provincial or city orchestras. Some cities have annual events and important classical music festivals like Semana Musical Llao Llao in San Carlos de Bariloche, and the multitudinous Amadeus in Buenos Aires.\nArgentine folk music is uniquely vast. Beyond dozens of regional dances, a national folk style emerged in the 1930s. Perón's Argentina would give rise to Nueva Canción, as artists began expressing in their music objections to political themes. Atahualpa Yupanqui, the greatest Argentine folk musician, and Mercedes Sosa would be defining figures in shaping Nueva Canción, gaining worldwide popularity in the process. The style found a huge reception in Chile, where it took off in the 1970s, and went on to influence the entirety of Latin American music. Today, Chango Spasiuk and Soledad Pastorutti have brought folk back to younger generations. León Gieco's \"folk-rock\" bridged the gap between Argentine folklore and Argentine rock, introducing both styles to millions overseas in successive tours.\n\nBuenos Aires is one of the world's great capitals of theater. The Teatro Colón is a national landmark for opera and classical performances; built at the end of the 19th century, its acoustics are considered the best in the world, and is currently undergoing a major refurbishment in order to preserve its outstanding sound characteristics, the French-romantic style, the impressive Golden Room (a minor auditorium targeted to Chamber Music performances), and the museum at the entrance. With its theatre scene of national and international caliber, Corrientes Avenue is synonymous with the art. It is thought of as \"the street that never sleeps\", and sometimes referred to as the Broadway of Buenos Aires. Many great careers in acting, music, and film have begun in its many theaters. The \"Teatro General San Martín\" is one of the most prestigious, along Corrientes Avenue, and the \"Teatro Nacional Cervantes\" functions as the national stage theater of Argentina. The \"Teatro Argentino de La Plata\", \"El Círculo\" in Rosario, \"Independencia\" in Mendoza, and \"Libertador\" in Córdoba are also prominent. Griselda Gambaro, Copi, Roberto Cossa, Marco Denevi, Carlos Gorostiza, and Alberto Vaccarezza are a few of the more prominent Argentine playwrights. Julio Bocca, Jorge Donn, José Neglia, and Norma Fontenla are some of the great ballet dancers of the modern era.\n\nBesides many of the pasta, sausage, and dessert dishes common to continental Europe, Argentines enjoy a wide variety of Indigenous and Criollo creations, which include \"empanadas\" (a stuffed pastry), \"locro\" (a mixture of corn, beans, meat, bacon, onion, and gourd), humitas, and yerba mate, all originally indigenous Amerindian staples, the latter considered Argentina's national beverage. Other popular items include chorizo (a pork sausage), \"facturas\" (Viennese-style pastry), dulce de leche, a sort of milk caramel jam and the alfajor.\n\nThe Argentine barbecue \"asado\", includes suculent types of meat, among them chorizo, sweetbread, chitterlings, and \"morcilla\" (blood sausage). Thin sandwiches, known as sandwiches de miga, are also popular. Argentines have the highest consumption of red meat in the world.\n\nThe Argentine wine industry, long among the largest outside Europe, has benefited from growing investment since 1992; in 2007, 60% of foreign investment worldwide in viticulture was destined to Argentina. The country is the fifth most important wine producer in the world, with the annual \"per capita\" consumption of wine among the highest. Malbec grape, a discardable varietal in France (country of origin), has found in the Province of Mendoza an ideal environment to successfully develop and turn itself into the world's best Malbec. Mendoza accounts for 70% of the country's total wine production. \"Wine tourism\" is important in Mendoza province, with the impressive landscape of the Cordillera de Los Andes, and the highest peak in the Americas, Mount Aconcagua ( high) providing a very desirable destination for international tourism.\n\nThe official national sport of Argentina is pato, although it is not very popular. It is played with a six-handle ball on horseback.\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Argentina. The national football team has won 25 major international titles, including two FIFA World Cup, two Olympic gold medals and fourteen Copa América. Over one thousand Argentine players play abroad, the majority of them in European football leagues. There are 331,811 registered football players, with increasing numbers of girls and women, who have organized their own national championships since 1991, and were South American champions in 2006.\n\nThe Argentine Football Association (AFA) was formed in 1893, and is the eighth oldest national football association in the world. The AFA today counts 3,377 football clubs, including 20 in the Premier Division. Since the AFA went professional in 1931, fifteen teams have won national tournament titles, including River Plate with 33 and Boca Juniors with 24. Over the last twenty years, futsal and beach football have become increasingly popular. The Argentine national beach football team was one of four competitors in the first international championship for the sport, in Miami in 1993.\n\nBasketball is the second most popular sport; a number of basketball players play in the NBA and European leagues including Emanuel Ginóbili, Andrés Nocioni, Carlos Delfino, Luis Scola, Pablo Prigioni, Juan Ignacio Sánchez and Fabricio Oberto. The national basketball team won the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics and the bronze medal in 2008. Argentina is currently ranked third by the International Basketball Federation.\n\nArgentina has an important rugby union team, \"Los Pumas\", with many of its players playing in Europe. Argentina beat host nation France twice in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, placing them third in the competition. The Pumas are currently ranked fifth in the official world rankings.\n\nHistorically, Argentina has had a strong showing within Auto racing. Juan Manuel Fangio was five times Formula One world champion under four different teams, winning 102 of his 184 international races, and is widely ranked as the greatest driver of all time. Other distinguished racers were Oscar Alfredo Gálvez, Juan Gálvez, José Froilán González and Carlos Reutemann.\n\nField hockey with the national team \"Las Leonas\" is one of the world's most successful, with four Olympic medals, two World Cups, a World League and seven Champions Trophy. Luciana Aymar is recognized as the best female player in the history of this sport.\n\nArgentina reigns undisputed in Polo, having won more international championships than any other country and been seldom beaten since the 1930s. The Argentine Polo Championship is the sport's most important international team trophy. The country is home to most of the world's top players, among them Adolfo Cambiaso, the best in Polo history.\n\nOther popular sports include tennis, handball, boxing, volleyball and golf.\n\nThe Vamos vamos Argentina chant is a trademark of Argentine fans during sporting events.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4987382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4987382", "title": "Demerit good", "text": "Demerit good\n\nIn economics, a demerit good is \"a good or service whose consumption is considered unhealthy, degrading, or otherwise socially undesirable due to the perceived negative effects on the consumers themselves\". It is over-consumed if left to market forces. Examples of demerit goods include tobacco, alcoholic beverages, recreational drugs, gambling, junk food and prostitution. Because of the nature of these goods, governments often levy taxes on these goods (specifically, sin taxes), in some cases regulating or banning consumption or advertisement of these goods.\n\nThere is an important conceptual distinction between a demerit good and a negative externality. A negative externality occurs when the consumption of a good has measurable negative consequences on others who do not consume the good themselves. Pollution (due, for example, to automobile use) is the canonical example of a negative externality. Another example is cigarettes. It not only affects a deliberate or addicted smoker through damage to health, but also indirect smokers exposed to the smoke (second hand smoking). By contrast, a demerit good is viewed as undesirable because its consumption has negative effects upon the consumer. \n\nTwo fundamental views in welfare economics, welfarism and paternalism, differ in their conceptual treatment of 'demerit goods'. Simply, welfarism takes the individual's \"own\" perception of the utility of a good as the final judgement of the utility of the good for that person, and thereby disallows the concept of a 'demerit good' (while allowing the analysis of negative externalities). As an extreme example, if a heroin addict purchases heroin, they must have done so because heroin makes them better off, and this transaction is viewed as a net social positive (assuming that the addict does not commit any other crimes as the result of their addiction). Paternalism, on the other hand, judges that heroin \"isn't good for you\", and feels free to override the judgement of the addicts themselves (see 'Welfare Economics, Boadway and Bruce, Basil Blackwell 1984).\n\n"}

Therefore, education policy can directly affect the education people engage in at all ages.\n\nExamples of areas subject to debate in education policy, specifically from the field of schools, include school size, class size, school choice, school privatization, tracking, teacher selection, education and certification, teacher pay, teaching methods, curricular content, graduation requirements, school infrastructure investment, and the values that schools are expected to uphold and model.\n\nIssues in education policy also address problems within higher education. The Pell Institute analyzes the barriers experienced by teachers and students within community colleges and universities. These issues involve undocumented students, sex education, and federal grant aides.\n\nEducation policy analysis is the scholarly study of education policy. It seeks to answer questions about the purpose of education, the objectives (societal and personal) that it is designed to attain, the methods for attaining them and the tools for measuring their success or failure. Research intended to inform education policy is carried out in a wide variety of institutions and in many academic disciplines. Important researchers are affiliated with departments of psychology, economics, sociology, and human development, in addition to schools and departments of education or public policy. Examples of education policy analysis may be found in such academic journals as \"Education Policy Analysis Archives\" and in university policy centers such as the National Education Policy Center housed at the University of Colorado Boulder University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nEducation reform is a topic that is in the mainstream currently in the United States. Over the past 30 years, policy makers have made a steady increase at the state and federal levels of government in their involvement of US schools. US states spend most of their budgets funding schools, whereas only a small portion of the federal budget is allocated to education. Although states hold the constitutional right on education policy, the federal government is advancing their role by building on state and local education policies. In the state of Texas during the 84th Legislature, there were several education reform bills filed and sponsored by many education reform groups, such as Texans for Education Reform. Lawmakers want to create more involvement at the local level, and more transparency in our public schools. These groups are being pressured and opposed by teachers' unions saying that accountability and transparency policies are targeting educators, and that they are trying to hold them responsible for the education system.\n\nTeacher policy is education policy that addresses the preparation, recruitment, and retention of teachers. A teacher policy is guided by the same overall vision and essential characteristics as the wider education policy: it should be strategic, holistic, feasible, sustainable, and context-sensitive. Overall objectives and major challenges to be addressed, the funding to achieve these objectives, the demographic parameters of the learner population and the human resources required to achieve universally accessible quality education should all be addressed in a comprehensive teacher policy.\n\nNine key dimensions are considered crucial to any comprehensive teacher policy: Teacher Recruitment and Retention, Teacher education (initial and continuing), Deployment, Career Structures/Paths, Teacher Employment and Working Conditions, Teach Reward and Remuneration, Teacher Standards, Teacher Accountability, and School Governance.\n\nAn effective education system must have a way to attract and retain outstanding educators. There has been a growing demand for teachers but the supply continues to diminish and many of them leave their profession. This development is a threat to the “academic and economic welfare of students.” It affects learning and drain taxpayers’ money. The federal and state governments along with the districts must invest in complete human capital systems. It is the best approach in preparing and retaining committed and capable mentors for the long-term. A reasonable strategy in talent management for the education sector must focus on recruitment, development, and retention of intelligent and efficient teachers. \n\nTeachers need to go back to school periodically to become better educators. Good mentors can become outstanding by going further than textbooks. This is the logic behind continuing education. Technology in the form of web-based workshops and lectures will be helpful. School administrators and district officials must push their teachers to make use of available resources and opportunities to continue the learning process. Conferences with workshops are also valuable because these activities provide teachers with tools for integration of technology in the classrooms and Continuing Professional Development Units in boosting their careers. \n\n\nInformation on education policy, OECD - Contains indicators and information about education policy in OECD countries.\n\n"}
{"id": "26306034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26306034", "title": "English Romantic sonnets", "text": "English Romantic sonnets\n\nThe sonnet was a popular form of poetry during the Romantic period: William Wordsworth wrote 523 sonnets, John Keats 67, Samuel Taylor Coleridge 48, and Percy Bysshe Shelley 18. \n\nThe sonnet is a poem of fourteen lines that follows a strict rhyme scheme and specific structure, the invention of which is credited to the thirteenth century Italian poet Giacomo Da Lentini, and was subsequently made famous by Petrarch. Thomas Wyatt, in the early 16th century, introduced the sonnet into England. However, it was the Earl of Surrey who developed the rhyme scheme – \"abab cdcd efef gg\" – which now characterizes the English or Shakespearean sonnet.\n\nRomantic literature in English includes both Shakespearean and Petrarchan sonnets.\n\nThe sonnet has been a popular literary form since its creation, made famous by Dante, Petrarch, Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare, John Donne, and John Milton, but during the late 17th century and early 18th century the sonnet fell out of favor. Many sonnets were still being produced but were not as popular. Revival began with poets like Thomas Edwards and Charlotte Turner Smith before later including the other Romantics such as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats and Shelley. \n\nThe Romantic poets were influenced by all their famous predecessors, when writing sonnets, but the most important single influence was Milton, who had written less than 30 sonnets himself. In the 17th century Milton kept the sonnet form alive while also expanding the subject matter – which hitherto had mainly been love – by writing about ideas, events, history, and contemporary issues. Like Milton, the Romantics wrote relatively few love sonnets and the sonnet of the Romantic era include politics, nature, friendship, art, history, religion, life and death. In fact some of the Romantic poets even wrote sonnets about sonnets. Wordsworth’s \"Scorn not the Sonnet\" is an example of this. Keats also wrote about sonnets, most notably in \"On the Sonnet\" (1819), which like Wordsworth's poem defends the form in content and by using it himself.\n\nMilton especially had a strong influence on Wordsworth after he heard his sonnets read aloud. Of sonnets he said, “Rather [I] like to employ them occasionally, tho’ I have done it much less in proportion than my great Masters, especially Milton”. Although Wordsworth wrote hundreds of sonnets, he saw himself in Milton's shadow. Wordsworth loved the sonnet form because once the simple rules were mastered he could take as much liberty as he wanted to explore topics of interest. He believed that poets should write sonnets to add variety to their work and keep them out of the trap of routine.\n\nThe sonnet form humbled many of the Romantics who are usually noted for their strong “I” assertion in lyric narratives. Coleridge too felt unsure of himself saying, “The sonnet has ever been a favourite species of composition with me; but I am conscious that I have not succeeded in it\".\n\nAlthough the Romantics wrote sonnets about a variety of subjects, the most common was nature. Petrarch also wrote many sonnets which included descriptions of nature, as did Shakespeare, but their use of nature was often incidental to the main theme relating to love or part of an analogy. Milton moved away from nature and it is missing from many of his sonnets. Nature, however, is the main subject of many of the Romantics sonnets. Many of the sonnets and poems of the era describe the calm, beauty, power or sublimity of nature and Nature is often personified to emphasise the closeness in the relationship between people to and nature. In other poems an analogy is made between man and nature. For instance, in Keats’s \"The Human Seasons\", the changes of the seasons are compared with the stages of human life.\n\nThe two classic forms that the Romantics used the most were the Petrarchan sonnet and the Shakespearean sonnet. The Petrarchan or Italian form usually follows a rhyme scheme of abba abba cde cde. The poem is usually divided into two sections with the first eight lines, an octave, and the last six, a sestet. There is usually a turn in the poem around line nine. The Shakespearean form has a rhyme scheme of abab cdcd efef gg. The end rhyming couplet is often used to turn the idea that has been building through the poem.\n\nThe Romantics played with these forms. Since the general topic and focus of the sonnet shifted in this era, it makes sense that the form would also change to mirror the content. A sonnet like Shelley’s \"Ozymandias\" uses neither a complete Shakespearian nor Petrarchan rhyme scheme. The pattern of ab ab ac dc ed ef ef, is no less a sonnet than those of conventional patterns. The movement away from set structures could be to mirror the feelings of detachment in the poem.\n\nCharlotte Turner Smith (1749 – 1806) was one of the first Romantics to bring back the use of the sonnet. She is noted for her experimentation with forms, combining In new ways the Petrarchan and Shakespearean forms, picking and choosing the best features of both. Her poem, \"Sonnet LVI, The Captive Escaped in the Wilds of America\", has end lines that turn the whole poem in a new direction using mostly near rhymes. \n\nThe ode might seem a much more likely form for the Romantics, because it is an irregular form and adapted in many ways to the speaker and subject. These elements of the ode were often used to convey rapid changes in thoughts and emotions. However, the sonnet form gave the Romantic poets the best of both worlds. A poem like Shelley’s \"Ode to the West Wind\" contains violent shifts reflecting the blowing wind, but it consists of sections made up of sonnets. The Romantics prove with this that they could master the ways of their predecessors that they so admire and still move on to something new. The form of the sonnet helps Shelley to contain something that is uncontainable. Following the form of Dante in his \"Divine Comedy\", Shelley uses a unique terza rima pattern to create a structure like the flow of the wind, and yet contain the poem, so there is a sense of closure at the end.\n"}

Adopted in 1921 after being officially enshrined into the nation's constitution, it has been the flag of the Principality of Liechtenstein since that year. The crown was added to the flag in 1937 after the country found out at the Summer Olympics held the previous year that their flag was identical to the flag of Haiti.\n\nLiechtenstein was formed in 1719 as a principality within the Holy Roman Empire, and gained complete independence in 1866. Within this period, the colours blue and red were selected to feature on the flag, instead of the gold and red on the coat of arms that would have customarily been employed instead. These new livery colours were first utilized by Prince Joseph Wenzel I in 1764.\n\nA new constitution for the Principality was formulated and proclaimed in October 1921. It made the blue and red banner the national flag by granting it \"official status\". Fifteen years later, during the 1936 Summer Olympics, the country came to the realization that its flag was identical to the flag of Haiti, even though Haiti did not participate in the Olympics that year. Because of this finding, the government added the prince's crown to the canton. This change served two purposes – to signify Liechtenstein's position as a principality, and to distinguish its flag from Haiti's. This modified design was adopted on June 24, 1937.\n\nThe colors and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The blue represents the sky, while red alludes to the \"evening fires\" that are lit inside houses throughout the country. The crown – whose colour is disputed – epitomizes the \"unity of the people and their prince.\" While \"The World Factbook\" and Reuters describe it as gold in colour, other sources – such as Whitney Smith in the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" – describe it as yellow.\n\nIn February 2004, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of Liechtenstein called for the capture of a Falcon 50 private jet that was owned by the former regime of Saddam Hussein and kept in Amman, Jordan. They sought this action because the plane flew the flag of Liechtenstein and had a registration number from Switzerland, which keeps the civil aviation records of the Principality. This was carried out shortly afterwards in order to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483. After being transported to Basel and revamped entirely, the Liechtensteiner government returned the plane to the new government of Iraq on December 5, 2005. This marked the first Iraqi aircraft seized under UN sanctions to be given back to the country.\n\nThe eleven municipalities each have their own flag.\n\n"}

Many grinders identify with the biopunk movement, open-source transhumanism, and techno-progressivism. The Grinder movement is strongly associated with the body modification movement and practices actual implantation of cybernetic devices in organic bodies as a method of working towards transhumanism, such as designing and installing do-it-yourself body-enhancements such as magnetic implants. Biohacking emerged in a growing trend of non-institutional science and technology development.\n\nAccording to Biohack.me, \"Grinders are passionate individuals who believe the tools and knowledge of science belong to everyone. Grinders practice functional extreme body modification in an effort to improve the human condition. [Grinders] hack [them]selves with electronic hardware to extend and improve human capacities. Grinders believe in action, [thei]r bodies the experiment.\"\n\n\"Biohacking\" can also refer to managing one's own biology using a combination of medical, nutritional and electronic techniques. This may include the use of nootropics, non-toxic substances, and/or cybernetic devices for recording biometric data (as in the Quantified Self movement).\n\nGrinders largely identify with transhumanist and biopunk ideologies. Transhumanism is the belief that it is both possible and desirable to so fundamentally alter the human condition through the use of technologies as to inaugurate a superior post-human being. Kara Platoni categorizes such technological modifications as \"hard\" biohacking, noting the desire to expand the boundaries of human perception and even create \"new senses\".\n\nBiopunk is a techno-progressive cultural and intellectual movement which advocates open access to genetic information and espouses the liberating potential of truly democratic technological development. Like other punk movements, Biopunk encourages the DIY ethic. \"Grinders\" adhere to an anarchist strain of biopunk that emphasizes non-hierarchical science and DIY.\n\nCyborgs and cyborg theory strongly influence techno-progressivism and transhumanism and are thus influential to both the DIY-bio movement and grinder movement in general. Some biohackers such as Grinders and the British professor of cybernetics Kevin Warwick actively design and implement technologies which are integrated directly into the organic body. Examples of this include DIY magnetic fingertip implants or Warwick’s \"Project Cyborg\". Cyborg theory was kickstarted in 1985 with the publication of Donna Haraway’s influential \"Cyborg Manifesto\" but can be traced back all the way to Manfred Clynes and Nathan Klines’ article, \"Cyborgs and Space\". This body of theory criticizes the rigidity of ontological boundaries and attempts to denaturalize artificial dichotomies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

By the time of Louis XIV's death in 1715, there were several hundred guéridons at Versailles, and within a generation they had taken an infinity of forms: columns, tripods, termini and mythological figures. Some of the simpler and more artistic forms were of wood carved with familiar decorative motives and gilded.

Once detonated, it employs the radioactive energy source Solinium 2 (an element not yet discovered by humans), destroying all living tissue in the area while leaving landscape and buildings untouched. It was used on Fowl Manor in \"Artemis Fowl\", and, later, in \"\", Opal Koboi manufactures a larger missile-guided bio-bomb and a compact bio-bomb with a plasma screen that can only be blocked by the rigid polymer of a LEP helmet.\n\nThe Book of the People is the Fairy bible, known by the fairies themselves simply as the Book. It is written in Gnommish, the fairy language. As it contains the history of the People and their life teachings, Artemis Fowl manages to secure a copy from an alcoholic fairy in Ho Chi Minh City and use it to kidnap Holly Short, and to decode Gnommish. The first few lines are included in the first book.\n\nSome of the first lines are:\n\nIt also states the proper Ritual in which one buries an acorn to regain his or her powers. Apart from Artemis and his bodyguard, no humans are said to have seen the Book. If a human touches the Book without the fairy's permission it will combust.\n\nOriginally, the book was printed in spirals, which is how ancient fairy texts were read. However, reading in circles gave fairies migraines, so normally printed version have been made (ordinary Gnommish), this is in the typical western version of reading, left-to-right, top-to-bottom.\n\nA fairy weapon, primarily used by the LEP to incapacitate any foes they may face. They are designed as bludgeoning weapons, and once powered, they will send a 1000 volt shock (10,000 volts in Artemis Fowl and the Atlantis Complex when used by Turnball) into the target- presumably enough to incapacitate a fairy, but insufficient when used against a human. An LEPretrieval squad attempted to use them against Butler in the Fowl Manor siege, to no avail.\n\nA script only known by centaurs. The cipher is slightly easier to translate than Gnommish because many of the symbols look similar to their English counterparts. It can be read fluently once familiar, and is more like a recognisable font than a language.\n\nA thin sheet of foil that is wrapped around the body to imitate invisibility and to blend in with the surrounding environment. The foil is dotted with a series of micro-cameras, which enable the sheet to make an image of the wearer's background. Unfortunately, the entire surface uses circuits, which means that the invisibility can fail in rain or if the sheet is flattened by an object.\n\nIn \"\", however, Eoin Colfer states that the cam-foils are made of fairy-made diamonds that reflect light regardless of the direction and angle of viewing. Crushing the beads causes the sheet to fail.\n\nA specialized cannon designed to incapacitate any creature whose DNA is coded into the cannon with a laser. Most notably, the Koboi Laboratories is protected with DNA stun cannons.\n\nA tiny LEP-issue camera within a contact lens; once attached to the user's eye, it is virtually invisible. However, to lower visibility, fairies tend to use one that matches their eye color. In \"The Eternity Code\", Artemis uses a hazel-colored lens, causing Jon Spiro to realize that something is \"wrong with [his] eyes\". It is used as a remote camera, which also has several filters, including thermal and x-ray. It should be noted that whenever one changes filters, a small shock passes through the iris-cam, which may cause discomfort. The invention of the iris cam won Foaly a school science project, Opal Koboi being runner up with her wing designs.\n\nPart of the official LEP uniform, the LEP Helmet was developed by Foaly. The helmet includes a motion-sensor filter which flags moving objects \"with an orange corona\". The casing of the LEP helmet is made of impregnable polymer. An LEP helmet contains a visor, a camera, two 400-watt lamps, and a pollution mask, as well as a microphone, and loudspeaker. All LEP helmets have a self-destruct system which can be activated remotely. When activated, the self-destruct system releases acid, which dissolves the helmet and anyone who was wearing it. Section Eight helmets, which are more sophisticated than normal LEP helmets, have more advanced functions, such as a visor with digital display, plus all of a normal LEP helmet's capabilities. Section Eight helmets can also be controlled from Haven and be moved around independently using microbead bags and the officers Section 8 helmet also have flying thrusters as demonstrated by Foaly in the fifth book.\n\nMagnastrips power the automobiles in Haven City. LEP automobiles have the ability to push other vehicles out of the way in case of emergency During the lockdown in \"\", all non-emergency vehicles lost power.\n\nInvented by Foaly, the medi-pac is an ice pack infused with magic healing crystals. Activated by crumpling the crystals together, it is applied to the wounded area. It is not as effective as magic, but it can be useful in a tight spot.\n\nA magical power, similar to hypnosis, that most of the fairy families are able to use, since only a small amount of magic is needed to \"mesmerize\" someone. It is even said that some humans have the power to do it. Someone who is under the \"mesmer\" has no control over their actions, and becomes entranced with the voice of the one mesmerizing. It requires direct eye contact, as well as a voice laced with suggestion; thus, the \"mesmer\" is useless against mirrored surfaces such as mirrored sunglasses or mirrored contact lenses, it is shown that a person of high intelligence can resist the mesmer, such as at the beginning of \"Artemis Fowl, the Arctic Incident\" when Holly was using the mesmer against Butler to command him to put down his weapon. Butler had been able to resist the mesmer although he gave in in the end. It is also notable that the Book forbids fairies from \"mesmerizing\" other fairies. It is also said that if someone resists the mesmer too much, his or her brain cells might be fried. If a someone is constantly mesmerized their pupils become increasingly ragged until they eventually go blind. In Book 6, \"The Time Paradox\", Butler had a heart attack when he tried to resist Opal Koboi's mesmer. It is also stated in Book 7, \"Artemis Fowl and the Atlantis Complex\", that when a person was mesmerized, \"A large part of their brains were switched off and the parts left awake were not going to be winning any Nobel prizes\".\n\nThe mind-wipe is a technology designed to erase parts of sentient memory, usually human. Any sighting of the People by a human being is erased from the memory of any humans involved. The mind-wipe has two forms; the block wipe, which obliterates the memory of a set period of time from the targeted mind, and the fine-tuned wipe, designed to remove only specific memories from the targeted mind. It was also mentioned that a block mind-wipe can cause a drop in IQ. A part of the process not fully understood by the People is that human minds usually invent new memories to fill in the gaps. However, if a human (or fairy for that matter) sees something related to what was mind wiped from them, the brain recalls the lost information. Example: You have been mind wiped to forget that a fairy shot you with a Neutrino 3000. If you later see a Neutrino 3000, \"residual memories\" may be sparked, and you will start to remember what happened.\n\nArtemis Fowl II, Domovoi Butler and Juliet all submitted to a fine-tune mind-wipe at the end of \"The Eternity Code\", but Artemis and Butler managed to initiate a total recall through a disk containing specific knowledge to trigger recall. Artemis' was an in-depth description of his escapades, as was Butler's, but Butler was able to recall all the memories totally after hearing merely his first name, Domovoi. There was nothing on the disk for Juliet, although Juliet herself achieves total recall in \"\", by listening to Turnball mesmerizing people.\n\nThe mood blanket is a multi-sensor massage and homeopathic garment meant for centaurs, created by Foaly.\n\nThe terms 'Mud People', 'Mud Men', 'Mud Woman', 'Mud Maid', 'Mud Boy', 'Mud Girl' and 'Mud Kid' are generalizations used by fairies to address humans. This term comes from the age of the Battle of Taillte, when the People were battling the \"Mud People\" to stay above ground, they gave up due to overwhelming numbers. This term also conveys fairies' dislike and even contempt towards the human race because of their pollution and the fact that humans forced fairies underground (partly because fairies can only have a child every twenty years).\n\nThis is the most basic model of the Neutrino in the Artemis Fowl books. It is used in the short story \"LEPrecon\". It is only mentioned in this story and is currently outdated.\n\nThe latest, lightweight model of fairy handguns, with three settings: \"Scorched, well done, and crisped to a cinder.\" The Neutrinos are nuclear powered, so they have almost unlimited ammunition. Neutrinos can only knock out people, they can't kill. The gun shoots an orange beam of heat at the target.\n\nThe new version of the Neutrino 2000 that Foaly designed after the . The guns are registered to only respond to one person, and every shot loosed by the Neutrino 3000 is recorded on a computer log. There are no metal parts, and, as Foaly describes, it is \"powered by kinetics, the motion of your body, with a backup mini-nuke cell... The casing is virtually impregnable\".\n\nA device that is capable of picking most human locks. Seen in \"Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code\" and \"Artemis Fowl: The Time Paradox\".\nHolly's mother had one, which she passed down to Holly. However, Mulch Diggums stole it during the Hamburg Incident as mentioned in \"The Time Paradox\".\n\nPowered by \"gaseous columns vented from the earth's core\", fairies can ride in titanium eggs or more leisurely shuttles to the surface to perform the Ritual or for other business. The elevators are natural vents which allow magma streams to shoot toward the surface; these irregular pressure releases are watched by the LEP technicians, and \"flare-prediction teams\" are accurate to about a tenth of a second with a 99.8% accuracy rating.\n\nA piece of fairy technology developed by Foaly that infallibly tells whether or not a person has seen a specific image before. Based on the premise that every image that a person sees leaves an infinitesimal etching on the retina that never disappears and therefore cannot be fooled by a mind-wipe, two suction cups resembling plungers are used to read the etchings on the subject's retinas. The seals on the suction cups are implanted with micro needles, which inject sedative through the subject's pores.\n\nThe Ritual is explained in the Book (the \"Fairy Bible\"). It consists of picking an acorn from an ancient oak tree at a bend in a river during a full moon and planting it far from the ancient oak. When a fairy does this, his or her magic is replenished. In \"\", it is shown that magic may be replenished with the help of a warlock, demonstrated by N1. In \"Artemis Fowl\", Artemis and Butler captured Holly Short while she was attempting to complete the Ritual.\nAn extract from the Fairy Bible describing the Ritual reads,\n\"From the earth thine power flows, \nGiven through courtesy, so thanks are owed. \nPluck thou the magick seed, \nWhere full moon, ancient oak and twisted water meet. \nAnd bury it far from where it was found, \nSo return your gift into the ground.\"\n\nA computer system invented by Foaly that monitors all human telecommunications and reviews phone calls with fairy-related \"buzzwords\". Because of the sheer amount of fairy-related culture, this method was somewhat unreliable for detecting breaches of security.\n\nA shield is a form of magic which allows the user to stay invisible to most observers. Fairies shield by increasing their heart rate, causing their bodies to vibrate so quickly that they are never in one place long enough to be seen by the naked eye. Usually, when using the shield, the fairy encounters resistance from non-vibrating clothing, equipment, etc., which causes a slight shimmer in the air. A shielded fairy would cause any object they were sitting upon to shatter under the high vibrations. Fairies have difficulty shielding in areas with high levels of radiation, like northern Russia.\nA shielded fairy can also be seen by if an anti-shield filter or by a high-speed camera, but requires viewers to look at the video frame by frame. In \"The Atlantis Complex\", Butler and Juliet see a shielded fairy using a type of sunglasses that Artemis had created which enable the wearer to see through fairy shields. However, rats and two species of monkey can naturally see through the shield.\n\nThe softnose laser is an illegal type of laser weapon with a lifetime of less than ten years. They were originally powered with solar cells, but were adapted to be powered by simple AA alkaline batteries in \"The Arctic Incident\". The softnose fires a laser at a slower speed, penetrating the target (instead of incapacitating), causing greater damage than a normal laser. The B'wa Kell goblin triad was armed with these weapons by Opal Koboi in the failed storming of Police Plaza.\n\nA radioactive element, still not in the human periodic table. It has a half-life of 14 seconds and is the main energy source of a bio-bomb.\n\nThe \"bio bomb\" used by the LEP utilizes Solinium in order to kill only living tissue. It is standard procedure to spray any LEP property with solinium-based tracker, as shown in \"The Arctic Incident\". Foaly was able to find Mulch Diggums by tracking the gold he stole from the \"Fowl Manor Siege\". Artemis Fowl also used a Solinium-based device, concealed in a button on his bodyguard Butler's jacket, to prevent electronic devices spying on him in Spain, as seen in \"The Lost Colony\" – it is noted by Butler that they \"may have ruined a few honeymoon videos\", showing the Solinium wipes digital visual recordings as well as preventing them.\n\nA tool used by the Fairies in the \"Artemis Fowl\" series. It stops time in a selected area using magic. Historically, time-stop fields were created by five warlocks who created a pentagram around the intended area. However, the process was mechanized by Foaly; the warlocks send their magic into lithium batteries, in which it can be stored until needed. Time-stops cut off an area entirely from the outside world; communications to the \"outside world\" are rendered useless, as nothing is able to penetrate the field. Once in a time-stop, it is impossible to change one's state of consciousness. If, upon entering the field, one is conscious, then it will be impossible to fall asleep, and vice versa. However, if one's state of consciousness is artificially changed (using sleeping pills, for example), the person in question will have dropped out of the time-stopped area into the outside world. The person will later wake up after the time-stop has disappeared, while to anyone still in the time-stop, the person will have disappeared.\n\nA fairy with strong magic skills who is highly trained in the magical arts. In the past warlocks have been used to stop time and wipe minds. In modern times, since Foaly \"had them do their thing into lithium batteries,\" Warlocks are still trained in the magical arts, but their training leans more towards the medical sides, such as emergency medicine. Most warlocks have a strong pacifist creed.\n\nDemon Warlock<br>\nDemon Warlocks are the most powerful warlocks by far, and risked being shunned by other demons owing to the fact normal demons are bloodthirsty and non-magical. Their powers extend to time-travel and firing bolts of magic. In the 21st century, only three Demon Warlocks are still alive: Qwan was the only survivor of the petrification following Leon Abbot's interference in the time-spell; his apprentice Qweffor was melded with Abbot and eventually suppressed in the Leader's mind, and No 1 was the first Warlock born since the time-spell. Following the return of the Demon island Hybras to Earth, No 1 releases Qweffor from Abbot's control, and begins training under Qwan.\n\nA device made by Artemis Fowl II from stolen fairy technology in \"\".

{"id": "508606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=508606", "title": "Little black dress", "text": "Little black dress\n\nA little black dress (LBD) is a black evening or cocktail dress, cut simply and often quite short. Fashion historians ascribe the origins of the little black dress to the 1920s designs of Coco Chanel and Jean Patou intended to be long-lasting, versatile, affordable, accessible to the widest market possible and in a neutral colour. Its ubiquity is such that it is often simply referred to as the \"LBD\".\n\nThe \"little black dress\" is considered essential to a complete wardrobe by many women and fashion observers, who believe it a \"rule of fashion\" that every woman should own a simple, elegant black dress that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion: for example, worn with a jacket and pumps for daytime business wear or with more ornate jewelry and accessories for evening or a formal event such as a wedding or a ball.\n\nBlack has always been a color rich in symbolism. In the early 18th century, black represented romance and artistry. As Ann Demeulemeester said of it, \"Black is poetic. How do you imagine a poet? In a bright yellow jacket? Probably not.\" In the early 19th century, black was adopted by the Romantics such as Byron, Shelley, and Keats, due to its melancholic aura. As the Victorian era began, black transitions from a color of art to one of grief and mourning – widows were expected to wear black for at least four years – and also for service livery, as the uniform for maids.\n\nIn 1926 Gabrielle \"Coco\" Chanel published a picture of a short, simple black dress in American \"Vogue\". It was calf-length, straight and decorated only by a few diagonal lines. \"Vogue\" called it \"Chanel's Ford\". Like the Model T, the little black dress was simple and accessible for women of all social classes. \"Vogue\" also said that the LBD would become \"a sort of uniform for all women of taste\". This, as well as other designs by the house of Chanel helped disassociate black from mourning, and reinvent it as the uniform of the high-class, wealthy, and chic. As Coco herself proclaimed, \"I imposed black; it's still going strong today, for black wipes out everything else around.\"\n\nThe little black dress continued to be popular through the Great Depression, predominantly through its economy and elegance, albeit with the line lengthened somewhat. Hollywood's influence on fashion helped the little black dress's popularity, but for more practical reasons: as Technicolor films became more common, filmmakers relied on little black dresses because other colors looked distorted on screen and botched the coloring process. During World War II, the style continued in part due to widespread rationing of textiles, and in part as a common uniform (accessorized for businesswear) for civilian women entering the workforce.\nThe rise of Dior's \"New Look\" in the post-war era and the sexual conservatism of the 1950s returned the little black dress to its roots as a uniform and a symbol of the dangerous woman. Hollywood femme fatales and fallen women characters were portrayed often in black halter-style dresses in contrast to the more conservative dresses of housewives or more wholesome Hollywood stars. Synthetic fibres made popular in the 1940s and 1950s broadened the availability and affordability of many designs.\n\nThe generation gap of the 1960s created a dichotomy in the design of the little black dress. The younger \"mod\" generation preferred, in general, a miniskirt on their versions of the dress and designers catering to the youth culture continued to push the envelope - shortening the skirt even more, creating cutouts or slits in the skirt or bodice of the dress, using sheer fabrics such as netting or tulle. Many women aspired to simple black sheath dresses similar to the black Givenchy dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in the film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\".\n\nThe popularity of casual fabrics, especially knits, for dress and business wear during the 1980s brought the little black dress back into vogue. Coupled with the fitness craze, the new designs incorporated details already popular at the time such as broad shoulders or peplums: later in the decade and into the 1990s, simpler designs in a variety of lengths and fullness were popular. The grunge culture of the 1990s saw the combination of the little black dress with both sandals and combat boots, though the dress itself remained simple in cut and fabric.\n\nThe new glamour of the late 1990s led to new variations of the dress but, like the 1950s and the 1970s, colour re-emerged as a factor in fashion and formalwear and repeatedly shows an aversion to black. The resurgence of body conscious clothing, muted colour schemes, and the reemergence of predominant black, along with the retrospective trends of the 1980s in the late 2000s paved way to the return of interest to the dress.\n\nThe black Givenchy dress of Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly in \"Breakfast at Tiffany’s\", designed by Hubert de Givenchy, epitomized the standard for wearing little black dresses accessorized with pearls (together called \"basic black\"), as was frequently seen throughout the early 1960s. The dress set a record in 2006 when it was auctioned for £410,000, six times its original estimate. Betty Boop, a cartoon character based in part on the 1920s \"it girl\" Clara Bow, was drawn wearing a little black dress in her early films, though with Technicolor later, Betty's dress became red.\n\nWallis Simpson, Duchess of Windsor, was known to own several little black dresses and said much in praise of the garments. One quote of the Duchess: \"When a little black dress is right, there is nothing else to wear in its place.\" Edith Piaf, the French folk icon, performed in a black sheath dress throughout her career: for this habit she was nicknamed \"little black sparrow\". It was thought that the dress helped audiences focus more on Piaf's singing and less on her appearance.\n\nIn an incident at London's Covent Garden theatre in 2004, a director fired the then-obese soprano Deborah Voigt from an opera because she could not fit into a \"little black cocktail dress\", replacing her with the slimmer Anne Schwanewilms.\n\n"}

Mat Rempits are not involved in street racing but rather go against each other for cheap thrills and to rebel against authorities while some of them perform stunts for fun, such as the wheelie, superman (lying flat on the seat), wikang, and scorpion (standing on the seat with one leg during a wheelie).\n\nThe word \"Rempit\" comes from \"ramp-(rev)-it\" (ramp the throttle). According to Kamus Dewan, the definition of \"Rempit\" is \"the act of whipping with a cane\". An alternative source of the word is derived from the noise made by a 2-stroke motorcycle. \"Mat\" is a Malay slang term used to address or to refer to a male person who is usually of Malay descent but is generally used derogatorily.\n\nMat Rempits usually travel in groups and create disturbance in bustling city centres on weekend nights. Mat Rempits are usually associated with gangsterism, gang robbery, street fighting, assault, vandalism, theft and bullying. Most motorcycles used by the Mat Rempits do not meet standard specifications, or have been modified extensively for greater speed, or just to make the exhaust noisier.\n\nAdditionally, most Mat Rempits do not have valid motorcycle licenses, do not pay road taxes, and ride stolen motorcycles. A growing number of housing estates have also been turned into racing tracks. It is estimated that there are about 200,000 Mat Rempits in Malaysia.\n\nIn April 2009, Malaysia's Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Musa Hassan said that the Mat Rempit had become violent and brazen instead of just being a public nuisance. He said \"We have to come down hard on the Mat Rempit who have started to become involved in robberies, snatch thefts and are even attacking innocent road users and we also need to use harsh tactics to catch the Mat Rempit that try to runaway from the roadblocks .\" He also added that \"Parents must be more responsible and should not allow their underage children to drive cars or ride motorcycles\"\n\nMat Rempits often end up being hospitalised after they fail to perform their actions or stunts such as 'superman', 'spider' and many more. Every weekend, around 10 people are hospitalised after being involved in accidents when riding motorcycles at high speed.\n\nAccording to Selangor police chief Datuk Tun Hisan Tun Hamzah, it was the parents who are the ones who should be blamed on this and while Kuala Lumpur deputy police chief, Datuk Amar Singh said that it was due to lack of parents' attention, Amar also pointed out that especially when they are in a big group, they would act beyond the limit by attacking the authorities and challenging traffic laws indiscriminately, further pointed out that their peers will challenge them to do something outrageous like assaulting police officers and challenging road rules, just to prove that they're not cowards.\" \n\nThe widespread phenomenon of the subculture has driven some politicians in Malaysia to voice out concern and need to help rehabilitate the people involved in activities pertaining to that culture. Khairy Jamaluddin and Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim as he was formerly mat rempit. Khairy says\" should become the \"Eyes and Ears\" of Malaysian\"\n\nIn 2006, a Member of Parliament representing Jenderak, Pahang suggested that the Mat Rempit should be accepted and guided to save them from indulging in dangerous activities.\n\nIn 2008, newspaper Kosmo! reported that the Mat Rempit in the state of Kelantan would be allowed to show off their skills at a special track to be built by the state government in Tanah Merah. The then-Menteri Besar, Datuk Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat said amidst the criticism that the track was not a waste of money, stating:\n\nA similar approach had been taken note of by neighbourly state Kedah, where its state government is looking into the possibility of building such an infrastructure, to \"overcome the menace\", saying another option was to create more job opportunities for them as most of them were jobless. The former state's Chief Minister Azizan Abdul Razak said:\nOn 3 May 2009, the Bukit Aman Traffic Division of the Royal Malaysian Police, together with the Road Transport Department, have launched a major integrated operation to crack down on both car and Mat Rempit motorcycle illegal racing. More than 115 motorcycles were impounded in the major operation which was held simultaneously in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Penang and Negeri Sembilan.\n\nThe subculture surrounding the Mat Rempit has been the focus of numerous films and songs in Malaysia. Film depictions of the subculture began in 1984 with \"Gila-Gila Remaja\", \"Ali Setan\" (1985), \"Litar Kasih\" (1996), \"KL Menjerit\" (2002) and its prequel \"KL Menjerit 1\" (2005), \"REMP-IT\" (2006), \"Bohsia: Jangan Pilih Jalan Hitam\" (2009), \"Adnan Semp-It\" and \"V3 Samseng Jalanan\" (both in 2010).\n\n\nDeejays JJ and Rudy (The Morning Crew) from hitz.fm radio station have made a parody of Teriyaki Boyz's called \"We're Not So Furious\", designed to mock Mat Rempit culture.\n\nMat Rempit was also the main influence for the song \"Salut\" by the Malaysian band, Spider, in their album Bintang 12\n\n\n"}

It is played by throwing wooden spears at the opponent while riding a horse to celebrate the rice-planting season. The word \"pasola\" means spear in the local language and derives from the Sanskrit \"sula\". According to legend, pasola originated with a woman from the village of Waiwuang. When her husband – a local leader – left home for an extended period, she believed him to be dead and eloped with a new lover from another village. After her husband returned, the woman still chose to stay with her new lover, and the two were married. To forget their leader's sadness, the people of Waiwuang held the festival of pasola. Originally the participants rode horses and threw spears at each other in an attempt to spill blood to the ground, as a way of thanking the ancestors for a successful harvest and ensuring another prosperous rice harvest. The ritual changed over time into more of a mock battle. The spear tips are now blunt and their metal tips removed. Whereas it was once considered an honour to die during pasola, only accidental deaths occasionally occur today. The human and horse blood which used to drench the field is now solely from sacrificed pigs, dogs, and chickens. Armed police are kept on guard to prevent fights from breaking out. Beginning in the 2010s, pasola has been promoted as a \"game\" for visiting spectators. The event traditionally begins when a certain kind of sea worm swims to shore, signifying the end of the wet season and the beginning of crop-planting. Today, the elders decide on the date in advance for the sake of tourists. Pasola is always held for four weeks in February and March.\n\n\n"}

First published in 1991, it hypothesizes a conspiracy by the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and possibly the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, to fabricate the Anno Domini dating system retrospectively, in order to place them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence. According to this scenario, the entire Carolingian period, including the figure of Charlemagne, is a fabrication, with a \"phantom time\" of 297 years (AD 614–911) added to the Early Middle Ages. The proposal has been universally rejected by mainstream historians.\n\nIllig was born in 1947 in Vohenstrauß, Bavaria.\nHe was active in an association dedicated to Immanuel Velikovsky, catastrophism and historical revisionism,\n\"Gesellschaft zur Rekonstruktion der Menschheits- und Naturgeschichte\".\nFrom 1989 to 1994 he acted as editor of the journal \"Vorzeit-Frühzeit-Gegenwart\".\nSince 1995, he has worked as a publisher and author under his own publishing company, \"Mantis-Verlag\", and publishing his own journal, \"Zeitensprünge\".\nOutside of his publications related to revised chronology, he has edited the works of Egon Friedell.\n\nBefore focusing on the early medieval period, Illig published various proposals for revised chronologies of prehistory and of Ancient Egypt.\nHis proposals received prominent coverage in German popular media in the 1990s. His 1996 \"Das erfundene Mittelalter\" also received scholarly recensions, but was universally rejected as fundamentally flawed by historians.\nIn 1997, the journal \"Ethik und Sozialwissenschaften\" offered a platform for critical discussion to Illig's proposal, with a number of historians commenting on its various aspects.\nAfter 1997, there has been little scholarly reception of Illig's ideas, although they continued to be discussed as pseudohistory in German popular media.\nIllig continued to publish on the \"phantom time hypothesis\" until at least 2013.\nAlso in 2013, he published on an unrelated topic of art history, on German Renaissance master Anton Pilgram, but again proposing revisions to conventional chronology, and arguing for the abolition of the art historical category of Mannerism.\n\nThe bases of Illig's hypothesis include:\n\n\nPublications by Illig:\n\n\n\n"}

Formed in 1971 by the Association of American Colleges (AAC), known today as the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AACU), PSEW worked to improve access to and equity within higher education for women, addressing the needs of university students, faculty, staff, and administrators. PSEW produced and distributed materials about the status of women in higher education, advised colleges and universities about policies related to affirmative action, women's studies programs, and hiring women faculty, and worked with policymakers to introduce legislation to improve gender equity in American higher education. PSEW's periodical, \"On Campus with Women\" (OCWW), ran from 1971-2013 through the AACU, publishing articles and research related to women in higher education. PSEW also played a significant role in the development and passage of Title IX, the portion of the U.S. Education Amendments of 1972 that prohibits discrimination in education on the basis of sex.\n\nPSEW was dissolved as a separate project on June 30, 1991 and reincorporated into the AACU as the Program on the Status and Education of Women. The program was directed by Caryn McTighe Musil until its conclusion in 2012. An extensive collection of the materials and publications produced by PSEW is held at the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University.\n\nThe Project on the Status and Education of Women was founded in 1971 as the first step in a shift by the Association of American Colleges (now the Association of American Colleges and Universities) towards attention to student diversity. Located in the headquarters of the AACU in Washington, D.C., the organization operated with a small staff. PSEW received funding through grants, including from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Ford Foundation.\n\nPSEW was integral in the passage of Title IX. As part of this effort, the organization visited schools, educated lawmakers on women's issues in academia, and advocated for policies to improve women's situation on campuses. PSEW pursued a focus on sexual harassment and rape on campus, producing educational materials on these subjects in the 1980s. Notably, the organization coined the term \"chilly climate\", used in many of its works to describe the challenges faced by women in education.\n\nBernice Resnick Sandler served as the director of PSEW from 1971-1991. Sandler was also active in the Women's Equity Action League (WEAL), through which she did similar work promoting gender equity in higher education. After Sandler, Caryn McTighe Musil served as director of the successor Program on the Status and Education of Women (PSEW) until 2012.\n\nMargaret C. Dunkle served as the Associate President of PSEW from 1972-1977. Roberta M. Hall and Grace L. Mastalli were also important staff members.\n\nPSEW was founded to aid colleges and universities in developing policies that addressed gender discrimination and sexual harassment. However, their work soon expanded beyond this mission, as PSEW staff began publishing original work on women in higher education. PSEW published over 100 reports, as well as booklets, pamphlets, and their newsletter \"On Campus with Women\". Their publications addressed a range of subjects including recruiting women students and faculty, issues relevant to minority students, sex discrimination in hiring, sex bias in research, Title IX, financial assistance, sexual harassment on campus, and the academic climate for women. Their materials reached college presidents and faculty as well as policymakers, and not only disseminated information about events and research relating to women in education, but also informed women directly about their own legal rights to education. PSEW published the first papers on women of color in higher education and the first national reports on sex discrimination in college sports, hostile classroom environments, campus gang rape, and sexual harassment.\n\nThe organization additionally produced publications addressing a term it coined, the \"chilly climate\" facing women at colleges and universities, a program of discourse which became a defining initiative for the group's contributions to equality in education. The \"chilly climate\" was illustrated by descriptions of challenges experienced by women students and faculty, from disparaging comments made about women and their academic capacities to the sidelining and interruption of women in class. PSEW's discussion of these challenges to women's experiences in a learning environment contributed to wider dialogue about the unequal learning environments experienced by people from various underserved groups.\n\nThe project published several influential works on the topic. In 1982, Hall and Sandler published \"The Classroom Climate: A Chilly One for Women?\" The paper was funded by a grant from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) of the U.S. Department of Education. PSEW held a conference in November 1982 called \"The Chilly Classroom Climate: Sharing Strategies for Change\" to publicize and discuss its findings. The final paper distributed at the conference sold over 40,000 copies between 1982 and 1990.\n\nPerhaps PSEW's most prominent publication was their periodical, \"On Campus with Women\" (OCWW), which published research and articles on issues pertaining to women in higher education. Founded by Sandler at the inception of the PSEW in 1971, its content focused on women's leadership, campus climate, curriculum and pedagogy, and new research on women's participation in higher education. In the fall of 2002, OCWW moved exclusively online. In 2013, the publication of \"On Campus with Women\" as a separate periodical ended, and its mission to cover gender issues in higher education was absorbed by the AACU's other journals, such as \"Liberal Education\" and \"Diversity and Democracy\".\n\nPSEW played in an integral role in working with Congressional staff and other organizations on the drafting and implementation of Title IX, interfacing with other organizations and Congress to construct and pass the law. PSEW also acted as a resource for universities to consult on potential implementation and policy between the law's June 1972 passage and the 1975 final report on enforcement and regulations from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The organization helped colleges and universities to institute policies that limited their risk of violating the Title IX requirements. During this interim period, PSEW often worked with the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education (NCWGE), a consortium of organizations founded to advocate for implementation regulations of Title IX on the enforcement, implementation, and funding of women's educational programs.\n\nAfter Title IX became law, PSEW continued to educate policymakers and government officials about women's issues on college campuses. PSEW staff often visited college campuses to identify issues and to work with administrations on the implementation and enforcement of Title IX. PSEW also created educational materials on rape and sexual harassment as resources for campuses.\n\nThe Project on the Status and Education of Women was the first national project directed at women of higher education and was one of first programs to address gender differences regarding campus climate. The project's involvement on the continued enforcement and implementation of Title IX has had lasting effects, as well as its creation and distribution of educational materials related to sexual harassment. Since its formation, PSEW has spearheaded a number of initiatives advocating gender equity in higher education.\n\nPSEW was dissolved as a separate project on June 30, 1991 as part of a push to focus on women's issues throughout the programming of the AAC. Sandler left her position of leadership and the group was reconstituted as the Program on the Status and Education of Women (PSEW). Upon being absorbed into the AACU, PSEW's primary source of funding no longer came from grants, as they were able to receive funding from the AACU. Musil directed the program until its conclusion in 2012, as the AACU redefined its mission to incorporate issues of gender equity. Some important reports and projects that were created during Musil's tenure were the report \"A Measure of Equity: Women's Progress in Higher Education (2008)\" and the establishment of the Campus Women Lead, which offered workshops on women's leadership, and the Women's Leadership Project for Inclusive Excellence.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "989897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=989897", "title": "Psychometry (paranormal)", "text": "Psychometry (paranormal)\n\nPsychometry (from Greek: ψυχή, \"psukhē\", \"spirit, soul\" and μέτρον, \"metron\", \"measure\"), also known as token-object reading, or psychoscopy, is a form of extrasensory perception characterized by the claimed ability to make relevant associations from an object of unknown history by making physical contact with that object. Supporters assert that an object may have an energy field that transfers knowledge regarding that object's history.\n\nThere is no scientific evidence that psychometry exists and the concept has been widely criticized.\n\nJoseph Rodes Buchanan coined the word \"psychometry\" (measuring the soul) in 1842. Buchanan came up with the idea that all things give off an emanation.\n\n\"The Past is entombed in the Present!\" The world is its own enduring monument; and that which is true of its physical, is likewise true of its mental career. The discoveries of Psychometry will enable us to explore the history of man, as those of geology enable us to explore the history of the earth. There are mental fossils for psychologists as well as mineral fossils for the geologists; and I believe that hereafter the psychologist and the geologist will go hand in hand — the one portraying the earth, its animals and its vegetation, while the other portrays the human beings who have roamed over its surface in the shadows, and the darkness of primeval barbarism! Aye, the mental telescope is now discovered which may pierce the depths of the past and bring us in full view of the grand and tragic passages of ancient history!\n\nBuchanan asserted that his particular psychism would supersede empiric science. He wrote a comprehensive treatise, \"Manual of Psychometry: the Dawn of a New Civilization\" (1885), detailing how the direct knowledge of psychometry would be applied to and affect the many various branches of science. It also would elevate the various schools of philosophy and arts thereby affecting wide social change and ultimately an enlightenment of humanity:\n\nThe thermometer measures caloric (\"thermo\" temperature). The barometer measures the weight (\"baro\", weight) of the atmosphere; the electrometer measures electric conditions; the psychometer measures the soul (\"psyche\"). In the case of Psychometry, however, the measuring assumes a new character, as the object measured and the measuring instrument are the same psychic element, and its measuring power is not limited to the psychic as it was developed in the first experiments, but has appeared by successive investigation to manifest a wider and wider area of power, until it became apparent that this psychic capacity was really the measure of all things in the Universe.\n\nBuchanan continued to promote psychometry throughout his life and his followers believed that it would revolutionize science in a comprehensive way as \"the dawn of a new civilization\". Buchanan's work on psychometry was continued by the geologist William Denton (1823-1883). In 1863, Denton published a book on the subject \"The Soul of Things\". Their work was criticized by Joseph Jastrow as based on delusion and wishful thinking.\n\nOthers, such as Stephen Pearl Andrews who promoted Psychometry along with his own new science of Universology, built upon Buchanan's ideas. As a lecturer Andrews asserted that such inquiries, as paraphrased by an 1878 \"New York Times\" article, \"demonstrated that the sympathy between the mind and body is an exact science\".\n\nIn the later nineteenth century demonstrations of psychometry became a popular part of stage acts and séances; with participants providing a personal object for \"reading\" by a medium or psychic. It is also commonly offered at psychic fairs as a type of psychic reading. At New Age events psychometry has claimed to help visitors \"meet the dearly departed\" (a form of spiritualism).\n\nThere is no scientific evidence that psychometry exists. Skeptics explain alleged successes of psychometry by cold reading and confirmation bias.\nSkeptic Robert Todd Carroll describes psychometry as a pseudoscience.\n\nThe majority of police departments polled do not use psychics and do not consider them credible or useful on cases. Proponents of psychometry have argued that psychic detectives have been used by law enforcement agencies on specific cases. However, psychologist Leonard Zusne has noted that \"enquiries with police officials... reveal that the involvement of psychics has not been very helpful, and that second-hand reports of it are often in gross error.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13442181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13442181", "title": "RēR Quarterly", "text": "RēR Quarterly\n\nThe RēR Quarterly (also known as Rē Records Quarterly and RēR Records Quarterly) was an English \"quarterly\" sound-magazine comprising an LP record and a magazine. It was published at irregular intervals between 1985 and 1997 by Recommended Records and November Books, and edited by English percussionist, lyricist and music theorist, Chris Cutler. It was sold internationally by Recommended Records via mail order and in specialist record shops.\n\nA total of thirteen issues were published (four volumes of four, four, three and two issues respectively) plus two \"collection\" issues featuring music selections from volumes 1 and 2. From volume 4 the LP was replaced by a CD and the CD and the magazine (now entitled unFILEd: The RēR Sourcebook) were sold separately or together as a set.\n\nThe idea for \"RēR Quarterly\" began in 1982 when Recommended Records released the \"Recommended Records Sampler\", a sampler double album by various artists that contained newly recorded and previously unreleased work by musicians and groups on the Recommended Records catalogue at the time.\n\nThe record in each issue of \"RēR Quarterly\" contained previously unreleased music by artists from across the world, including commissioned pieces, projects and live recordings. The A4 magazine (varying from 42 to 112 pages per issue) included artwork and theoretical and practical articles on music, often by the composers and performers featured on the record. In keeping with the goals of Recommended Records and its , Rock in Opposition, a number of new musicians and groups appeared on the records, many having their music published internationally for the first time.\n\nEditor Chris Cutler described the \"RēR Quarterly\" as:\n\"RēR Quarterly\" was distributed primarily to international subscribers by Recommended Records in London. Individual issues were also sold by the record label and other specialist record stores. Subscribers received special Subscription Editions that were numbered and signed, and included \"something extra\". For example, issue 1/1 included additional artwork by Peter Blegvad from his and John Greaves's 1977 album, \"Kew. Rhone.\", and issue 1/2 contained a cassette tape of Soviet pop songs from the early 1980s (at that time musicians in the former Soviet Union had little to no exposure in the West).\n\nWhen the \"RēR Quarterly\" was first published in 1985, it was entitled \"The Rē Records Quarterly\", \"Rē\" being the label Cutler had set up for his own projects in 1978 alongside Recommended Records which served for distribution, mailorder and as a label for outside projects. In 1988 the name changed to \"The RēR Records Quarterly\" since the distinction between the two operations no longer needed to be marked. In 1994 the magazine title was reduced to \"The RēR Quarterly\", which remained until it mutated again into the \"Sourcebook\" series.\n\nWhile \"RēR Quarterly\" was intended to be a quarterly sound-magazine, the gaps between issues varied from four months to four years. Cutler remarked that \"It was always hard to get sufficient material of quality for the Quarterly, and so it always took a long time to prepare each issue.\" Most of the pieces featured on the disc and magazine were commissioned, and as the magazine's circulation was small and it received no subsidy (each issue generally ran at a loss), the contributors received very little for their work. In addition, Cutler was not a full-time editor of the magazine and preparing each issue had to be squeezed into his schedule of recording, touring and running Recommended Records.\n\nPaul Oldfield wrote in the English music newspaper, \"Melody Maker\" in 1985: \"Theirs [\"RēR Quarterly\"] is the pursuit of unimaginable, packed in artwork of giddy luminescence.\"\n\nIn a review of Vol. 4 No. 1 at AllMusic, François Couture wrote that the music on the CD covers a broad range of styles, and that \"[i]t takes wide ears and a solid stomach to switch from Cornelius Cardew's sweet-and-sour orchestral music to N.O.R.M.A.'s street band exuberance\". He praised the tracks by Thinking Plague, Tom Nunn, Al Margolis and N.O.R.M.A., and said the album is \"important\" because pieces by Les Sales Combles, Diledadafish and Koongoortoog are the only recorded works left by these \"occulted projects\". Couture described this CD as \"an accurate snapshot\" of avant-garde music at the time, and gave it 3 stars out of 5.\n\nTom Schulte gave the Vol. 4 No. 2 CD 3 stars out of 5 in a review at AllMusic. He wrote that the album highlights include \"[w]ave-like shapes of ambient noise\" in \"Feu Brilliant\" by Keith Rowe and Alaid De Phillips, and extracts from a live radio performance in \"After Hours\" / \"The Colour of Blood\" by Shelley Hirsch, Jon Rose and Chris Cutler. Schulte called the latter a \"very interesting listen\" and described it as a \"collage of conversation and instrumentation\" that sounds like a \"bizarre radio play\".\n\nAll tracks written by the artist, except where noted.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll tracks written by the artist, except where noted.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll tracks written by the artist, except where noted.\n\n\n\n\nAll tracks written by the artist, except where noted.\n\n\n\nAll tracks written by the artist, except where noted.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "106004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=106004", "title": "Sex and sexuality in speculative fiction", "text": "Sex and sexuality in speculative fiction\n\nSexual themes are frequently used in science fiction or related genres. Such elements may include depictions of realistic sexual interactions in a science fictional setting, a protagonist with an alternative sexuality, or exploration of the varieties of sexual experience that deviate from the conventional.\n\nScience fiction and fantasy have sometimes been more constrained than non-genre narrative forms in their depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction also offers the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures, making it an incisive tool to examine sexual bias and forcing the reader to reconsider his or her cultural assumptions.\n\nPrior to the 1960s, explicit sexuality of any kind was not characteristic of genre speculative fiction due to the relatively high number of minors in the target audience. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture. New Wave and feminist science fiction authors imagined cultures in which a variety of gender models and atypical sexual relationships are the norm, and depictions of sex acts and alternative sexualities became commonplace.\n\nThere also exists , which explores sexuality and the presentation of themes aimed at inducing arousal.\n\nAs genres of popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem even more constrained than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterization and the effects that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Sex is often linked to disgust in science fiction and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also offer more freedom than do non-genre literatures to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculine superiority that permeate many cultures.\n\nIn speculative fiction, extrapolation allows writers to focus not on the way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way things could be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that Darko Suvin has called \"cognitive estrangement\": the recognition that what we are reading is not the world as we know it, but a world whose difference forces us to reconsider our own world with an outsider's perspective. When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider their heteronormative cultural assumptions; the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures makes science fiction an incisive tool to examine sexual bias. In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures (for example, mythological deities and heroic archetypes) who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted. Science fiction has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex.\n\n\"Uranian Worlds\", by Eric Garber and Lyn Paleo, is an authoritative guide to science fiction literature featuring gay, lesbian, transgender, and related themes. The book covers science fiction literature published before 1990 (2nd edition), providing a short review and commentary on each piece.\n\nSome of the themes explored in speculative fiction include:\n\n\"True History,\" a Greek-language tale by Assyrian writer Lucian (120-185 CE), has been called the first ever science fiction story. The narrator is suddenly enveloped by a typhoon and swept up to the Moon, which is inhabited by a society of men who are at war with the Sun. After the hero distinguishes himself in combat, the king gives him his son, the prince, in marriage. The all-male society reproduces (male children only) by giving birth from the thigh or by growing a child from a plant produced by planting the left testicle in the Moon's soil.\n\nIn other proto-SF works, sex itself, of any type, was equated with base desires or \"beastliness,\" as in \"Gulliver's Travels\" (1726), which contrasts the animalistic and overtly sexual Yahoos with the reserved and intelligent Houyhnhnms. Early works that showed sexually open characters to be morally impure include the first lesbian vampire story \"Carmilla\" (1872) by Sheridan Le Fanu (collected in \"In a Glass Darkly\").\n\nThe 1915 utopian novel \"Herland\" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman depicts the visit by three men to an all-female society in which women reproduce by parthenogenesis.\n\nDuring the pulp era, explicit sexuality of any kind was not characteristic of genre science fiction and fantasy. The frank treatment of sexual topics of earlier literature was abandoned. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published, such as Kay Tarrant, assistant editor of \"Astounding Science Fiction\", felt that they had to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents. Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed. In this sense, genre science fiction reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices. This was particularly true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time.\n\nIn Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel \"Brave New World\" (1932), natural reproduction has been abolished, with human embryos being raised artificially in \"hatcheries and conditioning centres.\" Recreational sex is promoted, often as a group activity, and marriage, pregnancy, natural birth, and parenthood are considered too vulgar to be mentioned in polite conversation.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of genre science fiction that involves a challenging amount of unconventional sexual activity is \"Odd John\" (1935) by Olaf Stapledon. John is a mutant with extraordinary mental abilities who will not allow himself to be bound by many of the rules imposed by the ordinary British society of his time. The novel strongly implies that he has consensual intercourse with his mother and that he seduces an older boy who becomes devoted to him but also suffers from the affront that the relationship creates to his own morals. John eventually concludes that any sexual interaction with \"normal\" humans is akin to bestiality.\n\n\"War with the Newts\", a 1936 satirical science fiction novel by Czech author Karel Čapek, concerns the discovery in the Pacific of a sea-dwelling race, an intelligent breed of newts - who are initially enslaved and exploited by humans and later rebel and go war against them. The book includes a detailed appendix entitled 'The Sex Life of the Newts', which examines the Newts' sexuality and reproductive processes in a pastiche of academese. This is one of the first attempts to speculate on what form sex might have among non-human intelligent beings.\n\nAs the readership for science fiction and fantasy began to age in the 1950s, writers were able to introduce more explicit sexuality into their work.\n\nPhilip José Farmer wrote \"The Lovers\" (1952), arguably the first science fiction story to feature sex as a major theme, and \"Strange Relations\" (1960), a collection of five stories about human/alien sexual relations. In his novel \"Flesh\" (1960), a hypermasculine antlered man ritually impregnates legions of virgins in order to counter declining male fertility.\n\nTheodore Sturgeon wrote many stories that emphasised the importance of love regardless of the current social norms, such as \"The World Well Lost\" (1953), a classic tale involving alien homosexuality, and the novel \"Venus Plus X\" (1960), in which a contemporary man awakens in a futuristic place where the people are hermaphrodites.\n\nRobert A. Heinlein's time-travel short story \"All You Zombies\" (1959) chronicles a young man (later revealed to be intersex) taken back in time and tricked into impregnating his younger, female self before he underwent a sex change. He then turns out to be the offspring of that union, with the paradoxical result that he is both his own mother and father.\n\nWhen Heinlein's \"The Puppet Masters\" was originally published, it was censored by the publisher to remove various references to sex. The opening scene, where the protagonist is called urgently to HQ on an early morning hour, was re-written to remove all mention of his being in bed with a girl he had casually picked up. The published version did mention that the book's alien invaders cause human beings whose bodies they take over to lose sexual feeling - but removed a later section mentioning that after some time on Earth the invaders \"discovered sex\" and started engaging in wild orgies and even broadcasting them on TV in areas under their control. Thirty years later, with changing mores, Heinlein published the book's full, unexpurgated text. \n\nIn \"Time Enough for Love\" (1973), Heinlein's recurring protagonist Lazarus Long - who never grows old and has an extremely long and eventful life - travels backward in time to the period of his own childhood. As an unintentional result, he falls in love with his own mother. He has no guilt feeling about pursuing and eventually consummating that relationship - considering her simply as an extremely attractive young woman named Maureen who just happens to have given birth to him thousands of years ago (as far as his personal timeline is concerned). The sequel,\"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\" takes place after Maureen had discovered the true identity of her lover - and shows that for her part, she was more amused than shocked or angry. \nPoul Anderson's 1958 novel \"War of the Wing-Men\", centers on a species of winged intelligent creatures and sexual differencws are central to its plot. Of the two mutually-hostile societies featured in the book, one practices monogamous marriage, while in the other there are every spring several days of a wild indiscriminate orgy - and a complete celibacy for the rest of the year. Ironically, both societies alike consider themselves chaste and the other depraved: \"We keep faithful to our mates while they fuck around indiscriminately - disgusting!\" ; \"We keep sex where it belongs, to one week per year where you are not really yourself. They do it all over the year- disgusting!\". Humans who land on the planet intervene in the centuries-long war, by showing members of the two societies that they are not all that different from each other.\n\nAnother Poul Anderson novel of the same period, \"Virgin Planet\" (1959), deals in a straightforward manner with homosexuality and polyamory on an exclusively female world. The plot twist is that the protagonist is the only male on a world of women, and though quite a few of them are interested in sex with him, it is never consummated during his sojourn on the planet.\n\nA mirror image was presented by A. Bertram Chandler in \"Spartan Planet\" (1969), featuring an exclusively male world, where by definition homosexual relations are the normal (and only) sexual relations. The plot revolves around the explosive social upheaval resulting when the planet is discovered by a spaceship from the wider galaxy, whose crew includes both men and women. \n\nUntil the late 1960s, few other writers depicted alternative sexuality or revised gender roles, nor openly investigated sexual questions.\n\nMore conventionally, A. Bertram Chandler's books include numerous episodes of free fall sex, his characters (male and female alike) strongly prone to extramarital relations and tending to while away the boring months-long Deep Space voyages by forming complicated love triangles.\n\nBy the late 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture. Within the genres, these changes were incorporated into a movement called \"the New Wave,\" a movement more skeptical of technology, more liberated socially, and more interested in stylistic experimentation. New Wave writers were more likely to claim an interest in \"inner space\" instead of outer space. They were less shy about explicit sexuality and more sympathetic to reconsiderations of gender roles and the social status of sexual minorities. Notable authors who often wrote on sexual themes included Joanna Russ, Thomas M. Disch, John Varley, James Tiptree, Jr., and Samuel R. Delany. Under the influence of New Wave editors and authors such as Michael Moorcock (editor of the influential \"New Worlds\" magazine) and Ursula K. Le Guin, sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality and gender multiplied in science fiction and fantasy, becoming commonplace.\n\nRobert A. Heinlein's \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" (1961) and \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\" (1966) both depict heterosexual group marriages and public nudity as desirable social norms, while in Heinlein's \"Time Enough for Love\" (1973), the main character argues strongly for the future liberty of homosexual sex. Heinlein's character Lazarus Long, travelling back in time to the period of his own childhood, discovers, to his surprise and (initial) shame, a sexual desire of his own mother - but overcoming this initial shame, he comes to think of her simply as \"Maureen\", an attractive young woman who is far from indifferent to him. \n\nSamuel R. Delany's Nebula Award-winning short story \"Aye, and Gomorrah\" (1967) posits the development of neutered human astronauts, and then depicts the people who become sexually oriented toward them. By imagining a new gender and resultant sexual orientation, the story allows readers to reflect on the real world while maintaining an estranging distance. In his 1975 science fiction novel entitled \"Dhalgren\", Delany colors his large canvas with characters of a wide variety of sexualities. Once again, sex is not the focus of the novel, although it does contain some of the first explicitly described scenes of gay sex in science fiction. Delany depicts, mostly with affection, characters with a wide variety of motivations and behaviours, with the effect of revealing to the reader the fact that these kinds of people exist in the real world. In later works, Delany blurs the line between science fiction and gay pornography. Delany faced resistance from book distribution companies for his treatment of these topics.\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin explores radically alternative forms of sexuality in \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" (1969) and again in \"Coming of Age in Karhide\" (1995), which imagine the sexuality of an alien \"human\" species in which individuals are neither \"male\" nor \"female,\" but undergo a monthly sexual cycle in which they randomly experience the activation of either male or female sexual organs and reproductive abilities; this makes them in a sense bisexual, and in other senses androgynous or hermaphroditic. It is common for an individual of that species to undergo at some moment of life pregnancy and birth-giving. while at another time having the male role and impregnating somebody else. Le Guin has written considerations of her own work in two essays, \"Is Gender Necessary?\" (1976) and \"Is Gender Necessary? Redux\" (1986), which respond to feminist and other criticism of \"The Left Hand of Darkness\". In these essays, she makes it clear that the novel's assumption that Gethenians would automatically find a mate of the gender opposite to the gender they were becoming produced an unintended heteronormativity. Le Guin has subsequently written many stories that examine the possibilities science fiction allows for non-traditional sexuality, such as the sexual bonding between clones in \"Nine Lives\" (1968) and the four-way marriages in \"Mountain Ways\" (1996).\n\nIn his 1972 novel \"The Gods Themselves\", Isaac Asimov describes an alien race with three genders, all of them necessary for sexual reproduction. One gender produces a form of sperm, another gender provides the energy needed for reproduction, and members of the third gender bear and raise the offspring. All three genders are included in sexual and social norms of expected and acceptable behavior. In this same novel, the hazards and problems of sex in microgravity are described, and while people born on the Moon are proficient at it, people from Earth are not.\n\nSimilarly, Poul Anderson's \"Three Worlds to Conquer\" depicts centaur-like beings living on Jupiter who have three genders: female, male and \"demi-male\". In order to conceive, a female must have sex with both a male and a demi-male within a short time of each other. In the society of the protagonist, there are stable, harmonious three-way families, in effect a formalized Menage a Trois, with the three partners on equal terms with each other. An individual in that society feels a strong attachment to all three parents - mother, father and demi-father - who all take part in bringing up the young. Conversely, among the harsh invaders who threaten to destroy the protagonist's homeland and culture, males are totally dominant over both females and demi-males; the latter are either killed at birth or preserved in subjugation for reproduction - which the protagonist regards as a barbaric aberration. \n\nFeminist science fiction authors imagined cultures in which homo- and bisexuality and a variety of gender models are the norm. Joanna Russ's award-winning short story \"When It Changed\" (1972), portraying a female-only lesbian society that flourished without men, and her novel \"The Female Man\" (1975), were enormously influential. Russ was largely responsible for introducing radical lesbian feminism into science fiction.\n\nThe bisexual female writer Alice Bradley Sheldon, who used James Tiptree, Jr. as her pen name, explored the sexual impulse as her main theme. Some stories by Tiptree portray humans becoming sexually obsessed with aliens, such as \"And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill's Side\" (1972), or aliens being sexually abused. \"The Girl Who Was Plugged In\" (1973) is an early precursor of cyberpunk that depicts a relationship via a cybernetically controlled body. In her award-winning novella \"Houston, Houston, Do You Read?\" (1976), Tiptree presents a female-only society after the extinction of men from disease. The society lacks stereotypically \"male\" problems such as war, but is stagnant. The women reproduce via cloning, and consider men to be comical.\n\nIn Robert Silverberg's novelette \"The Way to Spook City\" the protagonist meets and has an affair with a woman named Jill, who seems completely human - and convincingly, passionately female human. Increasingly in love with her, he still has a nagging suspicion that she is in fact a disguised member of the mysterious extraterrestrial species known as \"Spooks\", who had invaded and taken over a large part of the United States. Until the end, he repeatedly grapples with two questions: Is she human or a Spook? And if she is a Spook, could the two of them nevertheless build a life together? \n\nElizabeth A. Lynn's science fiction novel \"A Different Light\" (1978) features a same-sex relationship between two men, and inspired the name of the LGBT bookstore chain A Different Light. Lynn's The Chronicles of Tornor (1979–80) series of novels, the first of which won the World Fantasy Award, were among the first fantasy novels to include gay relationships as an unremarkable part of the cultural background. Lynn also wrote novels depicting sadomasochism.\n\nJohn Varley, who also came to prominence in the 1970s, is another writer who examined sexual themes in his work. In his \"Eight Worlds\" suite of stories and novels, humanity has achieved the ability to change sex quickly, easily and completely reversibly - leading to a casual attitude with people changing their sex back and forth as the sudden whim takes them. Homophobia is shown as initially inhibiting the uptake of this technology, as it engenders drastic changes in relationships, with bisexuality becoming the default mode for society. Varley's Gaea trilogy (1979-1984) features lesbian protagonists.\n\nFemale characters in science fiction films, such as \"Barbarella\" (1968), continued to be often portrayed as simple sex kittens.\n\nAfter the pushing back of boundaries in the 1960s and 70s, sex in genre science fiction gained wider acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional science fiction stories with little comment.\n\nJack L. Chalker's Well World series, launched in 1977, depicts a world - designed by the super science of a vanished extraterrestrial race, the Markovians - which is divided into numerous \"hexes\", each inhabited by different sentient race. Anyone entering one of these hexes is transformed into a member of the local race. This plot device gives a wide scope for exploring the divergent biology and cultures of the various species - including their sex life. For example, a human entering a hex inhabited by an insectoid intelligent race is transformed into a female of that species, feels sexual desire for a male and mates with him. Too late does she discover that in this species, pregnancy is fatal - the mother being devoured from the inside by her larvae. In a later part, a very macho villain gains control of a supercomputer whose power includes the ability to \"redesign\" people's bodies to almost any specification. He uses the computer to give himself a \"super-virile\" body, capable of a virtually unlimited number of erections and ejaculations - and then proceeds to transform his male enemies into beautiful women and induce in them a strong sexual desire towards himself. However, a computer breakdown restores to these captives their normal minds. Though they are still in women's bodies, these bodies were designed with great strength and stamina, so as to enable them to undergo repeated sexual encounters. Thus, they are well-equipped to chase, catch and suitably punish their abuser. \n\nSet on an alien planet, Octavia E. Butler's acclaimed short story \"Bloodchild\" (1984) depicts the complex relationship between human refugees and the insect-like aliens who keep them in a preserve to protect them, but also to use them as hosts for breeding their young. Sometimes called Butler's \"pregnant man story,\" \"Bloodchild\" won the Nebula Award, Hugo Award, and Locus Award. Other of Butler's works explore miscegenation, non-consensual sex, and hybridity.\n\nIn Robert Silverberg's 1982 novella \"Homefaring\", the protagonist enters the mind of an intelligent lobster of the very far future and experiences all aspects of lobster life, including sex: \"He approached a female, knowing precisely which one was the appropriate one, and sang to her, and she acknowledged his song with a song of her own, and raised her third pair of legs for him, and let him plant his gametes beside her oviducts. There was no apparent pleasure in it, as he remembered pleasure from his time as a human. Yet it brought him a subtle but unmistakable sense of fulfillment, of the completion of biological destiny, that had a kind of orgasmic finality about it, and left him calm and anchored at the absolute dead center of his soul\". When finally returning to his human body and his human lover, he keeps longing for the lobster life, to \"his mate and her millions of larvae\". \n\nQuentin and Alice, the extremely shy and insecure protagonists of Lev Grossman's fantasy novel \"The Magicians\", spend years as fellow students at a School of Magic without admitting to being deeply in love with each other. Only the experience of being magically turned into foxes enables them at last to break through their reserve: \"Increasingly, Quentin noticed one scent more than the others. It was a sharp, acrid, skunky musk that probably would have smelled like cat piss to a human being, but to a fox it was like a drug. He tackled the source of the smell, buried his snuffling muzzle in her fur, because he had known all along, with what was left of his consciousness, that what he was smelling was Alice. Vulpine hormones and instincts were powering up, taking over, manhandling what was left of his rational human mind. He locked his teeth in the thick fur of her neck. It didn't seem to hurt her any, or at least not in a way that was easily distinguishable from pleasure. He caught a glimpse of Alice's wild, dark fox eyes rolling with terror and then half shutting with pleasure. Their tiny quick breathes puffed white in the air and mingled and disappeared. Her white fox fur was coarse and smooth at the same time, and she made little yipping sounds every time he pushed himself deeper inside her. He never wanted to stop\". When resuming their human bodies, Quentin and Alice are initially even more shy and awkward with each other, and only after going through some harrowing magical experiences are they finally able to have human sex. \n\nLois McMaster Bujold explores many areas of sexuality in the multiple award-winning novels and stories of her Vorkosigan Saga (1986-ongoing), which are set in a fictional universe influenced by the availability of uterine replicators and significant genetic engineering. These areas include an all-male society, promiscuity, monastic celibacy, hermaphroditism, and bisexuality.\n\nIn the Mythopoeic Award-winning novel \"Unicorn Mountain\" (1988), Michael Bishop includes a gay male AIDS patient among the carefully drawn central characters who must respond to an irruption of dying unicorns at their Colorado ranch. The death of the hedonistic gay culture, and the safe sex campaign resulting from the AIDS epidemic, are explored, both literally and metaphorically.\n\nSex has a major role in Harry Turtledove's 1990 novel \"A World of Difference\", taking place on the planet Minerva (a more habitable analogue of Mars). Minervan animals (including the sentient Minervans) are hexameristically radially symmetrical. This means that they have six eyes spaced equally all around, see in all directions and have no \"back\" where somebody could sneak on them unnoticed. Females (referred to as \"mates\" by the Minervans) give birth to litters that consist of one male and five females, and the \"mates\" always die after reproducing because of torrential bleeding from the places where the six fetuses were attached; this gives a population multiplication of 5 per generation if all females live to adolescence and reproduce. Females reach puberty while still hardly out of childhood, and typically experience sex only once in the lifetime - leading to pregnancy and death at birth-giving. Thus, in Minervan society male dominance seems truly determined by a biological imperative - though it takes different forms in various Minervan societies: in some females are considered expendable and traded as property, in other they are cherished and their tragic fate mourned - but still their dependent status is taken for granted. The American women arriving on Minerva and discovering this situation consider it intolerable; a major plot element is their efforts, using the resources of Earth medical science, to find a way of saving the Minervan females and let them survive birth-giving. At the end, they do manage to save a particularly sympathetic Minervan female - potentially opening the way for a complete upheaval in Minervan society.\n\n\"Glory Season\" (1993) by David Brin is set on the planet Stratos, inhabited by a strain of human beings designed to conceive clones in winter, and normal children in summer. All clones are female, because males cannot reproduce themselves individually. Further, males and females have opposed seasons of sexual receptivity; women are sexually receptive in winter, and men in summer. (This unusual heterogamous reproductive cycle is known to be evolutionarily advantageous for some species of aphids.) The novel treats themes of separatist feminism and biological determinism.\n\nElizabeth Bear's novel \"Carnival\" (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, as a pair of gay male ambassador-spies attempt to infiltrate and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers have all but enslaved their men.\n\nThe plot of \"The Tamír Triad\" by Lynn Flewelling has a major Transsexual element. To begin with the protagonist, Prince Tobin, is to all appearances a male - both in his own perception and in that of others. Boys who swim naked together with Tobin have no reason to doubt his male anatomy. Yet, due to the magical reasons which are an important part of the plot, in the underlying, essential identity Tobin had always been a disguised girl. In the series' cataclysmic scene of magical change this becomes an evident physical fact, and Prince Tobin becomes Queen Tamír, shedding the male body and gaining a fully functioning female one. Yet, it takes Tamír a considerable time and effort to come to terms with her female sexuality.\n\nLateral Magazine, \"The freedom of a genre: Sexuality in speculative fiction\": 'In another twist of today’s society, \"Nontraditional Love\" by Rafael Grugman (2008) puts together an upside-down society where heterosexuality is outlawed, and homosexuality is the norm. A ‘traditional’ family unit consists of two dads with a surrogate mother. Alternatively, two mothers, one of whom bares a child. In a nod to the always-progressive Netherlands, this country is the only country progressive enough to allow opposite sex marriage. This is perhaps the most obvious example of cognitive estrangement. It puts the reader in the shoes of the oppressed by modelling an entire world of opposites around a fairly “normal” everyday heterosexual protagonist. A heterosexual reader would not only be able to identify with the main character, but be immersed in a world as oppressive and bigoted as the real world has been for homosexuals and the queer community throughout history.\n\n"}
{"id": "429885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=429885", "title": "Show Boat", "text": "Show Boat\n\nShow Boat is a musical in two acts, with music by Jerome Kern and book and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, based on Edna Ferber's best-selling novel of the same name. The musical follows the lives of the performers, stagehands and dock workers on the \"Cotton Blossom\", a Mississippi River show boat, over 40 years from 1887 to 1927. Its themes include racial prejudice and tragic, enduring love. The musical contributed such classic songs as \"Ol' Man River\", \"Make Believe\", and \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\".\n\nThe musical was first produced in 1927 by Florenz Ziegfeld. The premiere of \"Show Boat\" on Broadway was an important event in the history of American musical theatre. It \"was a radical departure in musical storytelling, marrying spectacle with seriousness\", compared with the trivial and unrealistic operettas, light musical comedies and \"Follies\"-type musical revues that defined Broadway in the 1890s and early 20th century. According to \"The Complete Book of Light Opera\":\n\nHere we come to a completely new genre – the musical play as distinguished from musical comedy. Now … the play was the thing, and everything else was subservient to that play. Now … came complete integration of song, humor and production numbers into a single and inextricable artistic entity.\n\nThe quality of \"Show Boat\" was recognized immediately by critics, and it is frequently revived. Awards did not exist for Broadway shows in 1927, when the show premiered, or in 1932 when its first revival was staged. Late 20th-century revivals of \"Show Boat\" have won both the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical (1995) and the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival (1991).\n\nIn doing research for her proposed novel \"Show Boat\", writer Edna Ferber spent several weeks on the \"James Adams Floating Palace Theatre\" in Bath, North Carolina, gathering material about a disappearing American entertainment venue, the river showboat. In a few weeks, she gained what she called a \"treasure trove of show-boat material, human, touching, true\". Jerome Kern was impressed by the novel and, hoping to adapt it as a musical, asked the critic Alexander Woollcott to introduce him to Ferber in October 1926. Woollcott introduced them that evening during the intermission of Kern's latest musical, \"Criss Cross\".\n\nFerber was at first shocked that anyone would want to adapt \"Show Boat\" as a musical. After being assured by Kern that he did not want to adapt it as the typical frivolous \"girlie\" show of the 1920s, she granted him and his collaborator Oscar Hammerstein II the rights to set her novel to music. After composing most of the first-act songs, Kern and Hammerstein auditioned their material for producer Florenz Ziegfeld, thinking that he was the person to create the elaborate production they felt necessary for Ferber's sprawling work. Ziegfeld was impressed with the show and agreed to produce it, writing the next day, \"This is the best musical comedy I have ever been fortunate to get a hold of; I am thrilled to produce it, this show is the opportunity of my life...\"\"Show Boat\", with its serious and dramatic nature, was considered an unusual choice for Ziegfeld, who was best known for revues such as the \"Ziegfeld Follies\".\n\nThough Ziegfeld anticipated opening his new theatre on Sixth Avenue with \"Show Boat\", the epic nature of the work required an unusually long gestation period and extensive changes during out-of-town tryouts. Impatient with Kern and Hammerstein and worried about the serious tone of the musical (he strongly disliked the songs \"Ol' Man River\" and \"Mis'ry's Comin' Around\"), Ziegfeld decided to open his theatre in February 1927 with \"Rio Rita\", a musical by Kern's collaborator Guy Bolton. When \"Rio Rita\" proved to be a success, \"Show Boat\"'s Broadway opening was delayed until \"Rita\" could be moved to another theatre.\n\nNote: Although the basic plot of \"Show Boat\" has always remained the same, over the years revisions and alterations were made by the creators, and over time by subsequent producers and directors. Some of these revisions were for length and some for convenience, as when a different actor played a certain role and was unable to perform a specialty piece written for the role's creator. Some have been made to reflect contemporary sensitivities toward race, gender and other social issues.\n\nIn 1887, the show boat \"Cotton Blossom\" arrives at the river dock in Natchez, Mississippi. The Reconstruction era had ended a decade earlier, and white-dominated Southern legislatures have imposed racial segregation and Jim Crow rules. The boat's owner, Cap'n Andy Hawks, introduces his actors to the crowd on the levee. A fistfight breaks out between Steve Baker, the leading man of the troupe, and Pete, a rough engineer who had been making passes at Steve's wife, the leading lady Julie La Verne. Steve knocks Pete down, and Pete swears revenge, suggesting he knows a dark secret about Julie. Cap'n Andy pretends to the shocked crowd that the fight was a preview of one of the melodramas to be performed. The troupe exits with the showboat band, and the crowd follows.\n\nA handsome riverboat gambler, Gaylord Ravenal, appears on the levee and is taken with eighteen-year-old Magnolia (\"Nolie\") Hawks, an aspiring performer and the daughter of Cap'n Andy and his wife Parthenia Ann (Parthy). Magnolia is likewise smitten with Ravenal (\"Make Believe\"). She seeks advice from Joe, a black dock worker aboard the boat, who has returned from buying flour for his wife Queenie, the ship's cook. He replies that there are \"lots like [Ravenal] on the river.\" As Magnolia goes inside the boat to tell her friend Julie about the handsome stranger, Joe mutters that she ought to ask the river for advice. He and the other dock workers reflect on the wisdom and indifference of \"Ol' Man River\", who doesn't seem to care what the world's troubles are, but \"jes' keeps rollin' along\".\n\nMagnolia finds Julie inside and announces that she's in love. Julie cautions her that this stranger could be just a \"no-account river fellow\". Magnolia says that if she found out he was \"no-account\", she'd stop loving him. Julie warns her that it's not that easy to stop loving someone, explaining that she'll always love Steve, singing a few lines of \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\". Queenie overhears – she is surprised that Julie knows that song as she has only heard \"colored folks\" sing it. Magnolia remarks that Julie sings it all the time, and when Queenie asks if she can sing the entire song, Julie obliges.\n\nDuring the rehearsal for that evening, Julie and Steve learn that the town sheriff is coming to arrest them. Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut on the back of her hand, sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists the show cannot proceed because Julie is a mulatto who has been passing as white and local law prohibits mixed marriages. Julie admits that her mother was black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has \"black blood\" in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but they still have to leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap'n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them.\n\nRavenal returns and asks for passage on the boat. Andy hires him as the new leading man and assigns his daughter Magnolia as the new leading lady, over her mother's objections. As Magnolia and Ravenal begin to rehearse their roles and in the process, kiss for the first time (infuriating Parthy), Joe reprises the last few lines of \"Ol' Man River\".\n\nWeeks later, Magnolia and Ravenal have been a hit with the crowds and have fallen in love. As the levee workers hum \"Ol' Man River\" in the background, he proposes to Magnolia, and she accepts. The couple joyously sings \"You Are Love\". They make plans to marry the next day while Parthy, who disapproves, is out of town. Parthy has discovered that Ravenal once killed a man and arrives with the Sheriff to interrupt the wedding festivities. The group learns that Ravenal was acquitted of murder. Cap'n Andy calls Parthy \"narrow-minded\" and defends Ravenal by announcing that he also once killed a man. Parthy faints, but the ceremony proceeds.\n\nSix years have passed, and it is 1893. Ravenal and Magnolia have moved to Chicago, where they make a precarious living from Ravenal's gambling. At first they are rich and enjoying the good life (\"Why Do I Love You?\") By 1903, they have a daughter, Kim, and after years of varying income, they are broke and rent a room in a boarding house. Depressed over his inability to support his family, Ravenal abandons Magnolia and Kim. Frank and Ellie, two former actors from the showboat, learn that Magnolia is living in the rooms they want to rent. The old friends seek a singing job for Magnolia at the Trocadero, the club where they are doing a New Year's show. Julie is working there. She has fallen into drinking after having been abandoned by Steve. At a rehearsal, she tries out the new song \"Bill.\" She appears to be thinking of Steve and sings it with great emotion. From her dressing-room, she hears Magnolia singing \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\" for her audition, the song which Julie taught her years ago. Julie secretly quits her job so that Magnolia can fill it, without learning of her sacrifice. \n\nRavenal visit his daughter Kim at the convent where she goes to school to say goodbye before leaving her forever (\"Make Believe\" (reprise)). On New Year's Eve, Andy and Parthy go to Chicago for a surprise visit to their daughter Magnolia. He goes to the Trocadero without his wife, and sees Magnolia overcome with emotion and nearly booed off stage. Andy rallies the crowd by starting a sing-along of the standard, \"After the Ball\". Magnolia becomes a great musical star.\n\nMore than 20 years pass, and it is 1927. An aged Joe on the \"Cotton Blossom\" sings a reprise of \"Ol' Man River\". Cap'n Andy has a chance meeting with Ravenal and arranges his reunion with Magnolia. Andy knows that Magnolia is retiring and returning to the \"Cotton Blossom\" with Kim, who has become a Broadway star. Kim gives her admirers a taste of her performing abilities by singing an updated, Charleston version of \"Why Do I Love You?\" Ravenal sings a reprise of \"You Are Love\" to the offstage Magnolia. Although he is uncertain about asking her to take him back, Magnolia, who has never stopped loving him, greets him warmly and does. As the happy couple walks up the boat's gangplank, Joe and the cast sing the last verse of \"Ol' Man River\".\n\nThe 1951 MGM film changed the final scenes of the story, as well as many small details. It reconciles Ravenal and Magnolia a few years after they separate, rather than 23. When Ravenal leaves Magnolia in Chicago, she is pregnant. By a chance meeting with Julie, Ravenal learns that Magnolia gave birth to his daughter. He returns to her and sees the child Kim playing. Magnolia sees them together and takes him back, and the family returns to the show boat. Joe and the chorus start singing \"Ol' Man River\" as the scenes unfold, then the paddlewheel starts turning in tempo with the music, as the ship heads down river. Julie is shown, viewing from a distance. She had watched the scene from the shadows.\n\nThe musical numbers in the original production were as follows:\nThe original production ran four-and-a-half hours during tryouts but was trimmed to just over three by the time it got to Broadway. During previews, two songs, \"Mis'ry's Comin' Aroun\" and \"Let's Start the New Year\", were cut from the show. \"Mis'ry's Comin' Aroun\" was published in the complete vocal score and fragments of it are also heard in the scoring, notably in the original 1927 overture and in the miscegenation scene. The song \"Be Happy, Too\" was also cut after the Washington, D.C., tryout The 1988 studio cast album reinstated the entire song, and it was also included in the 1994 Hal Prince revival. \"Let's Start the New Year\" was performed in the 1989 Paper Mill Playhouse production.\n\nTwo songs, \"Till Good Luck Comes My Way\" (sung by Ravenal) and \"Hey Feller!\" (sung by Queenie), were written mainly to cover scenery changes. They were discarded beginning with the 1946 revival, although \"Till Good Luck\" was included in the 1993 Harold Prince revival of the show. The comedy song, \"I Might Fall Back On You,\" was also cut beginning in 1946. It was restored in the 1951 film version and several stage productions since the 1980s. On record, \"Hey Feller!\" appears only on the 1988 EMI album. Kern and Hammerstein wrote two new songs for revivals and three more for the 1936 film version.\n\nThe Harold Fielding production in London in the early 1970s claimed to use the entire original score, but it omitted \"Hey, Feller!\" and \"In Dahomey\", among others. This cast album broke ground in being the first two-LP version of \"Show Boat\" ever released.\n\nThe score also includes four songs not originally written for \"Show Boat\": \"Bill\" was originally written by Kern and P. G. Wodehouse in 1917 and was reworked by Hammerstein for \"Show Boat\". Two other songs not by Kern and Hammerstein, \"Goodbye, My Lady Love\" by Joseph E. Howard and \"After the Ball\" by Charles K. Harris, were included by the authors for historical atmosphere and are included in revivals. The New Year's Eve scene features an instrumental version of \"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight\".\n\nSome of the following numbers have been cut or revised in subsequent productions, as noted below (the songs \"Ol' Man River\", \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\", and \"Bill\" have been included in every stage and film production of \"Show Boat\"):\nAdditional numbers have been included in films and revivals as follows:\n\n\nZiegfeld previewed the show in a pre-Broadway tour from November 15 to December 19, 1927. The locations included the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., the Nixon Theatre in Pittsburgh, the Ohio Theatre in Cleveland, and the Erlanger Theatre in Philadelphia. The show opened on Broadway at the Ziegfeld Theatre on December 27, 1927. The critics were immediately enthusiastic, and the show was a great popular success, running a year and a half, for a total of 572 performances.\n\nThe production was staged by Oscar Hammerstein II. Choreography for the show was by Sammy Lee. The original cast included Norma Terris as Magnolia Hawks and her daughter Kim (as an adult), Howard Marsh as Gaylord Ravenal, Helen Morgan as Julie LaVerne, Jules Bledsoe as Joe, Charles Winninger as Cap'n Andy Hawks, Edna May Oliver as Parthy Ann Hawks, Sammy White as Frank Schultz, Eva Puck as Ellie May Chipley, and Tess Gardella as Queenie. The orchestrator was Robert Russell Bennett, and the conductor was Victor Baravalle. The scenic design for the original production was by Joseph Urban, who had worked with Ziegfeld for many years in his \"Follies\" and had designed the elaborate new Ziegfeld Theatre itself. Costumes were designed by John Harkrider.\n\nIn his opening night review for the \"New York Times\", Brooks Atkinson called the book's adaptation \"intelligently made\", and the production one of \"unimpeachable skill and taste\". He termed Terris \"a revelation\"; Winninger \"extraordinarily persuasive and convincing\"; and Bledsoe's singing \"remarkably effective\".\n\nThe character Joe, the stevedore who sings \"Ol' Man River\", was expanded from the novel and written specifically by Kern and Hammerstein for Paul Robeson, already a noted actor and singer. Although he is the actor most identified with the role and the song, he was unavailable for the original production due to its opening delay. Jules Bledsoe premiered the part. Robeson played Joe in four notable productions of \"Show Boat\": the 1928 London premier production, the 1932 Broadway revival, the 1936 film version and a 1940 stage revival in Los Angeles.\n\nReviewing the 1932 Broadway revival, the critic Brooks Atkinson described Robeson's performance: \"Mr. Robeson has a touch of genius. It is not merely his voice, which is one of the richest organs on the stage. It is his understanding that gives 'Old Man River' an epic lift. When he sings...you realize that Jerome Kern's spiritual has reached its final expression.\"\n\n After closing at the Ziegfeld Theatre in 1929, the original production toured extensively. The national company is notable for including Irene Dunne as Magnolia. Hattie McDaniel played Queenie in a 1933 West Coast production, joined by tenor Allan Jones as Ravenal.\n\nDunne was soon offered a contract by RKO Studios and appeared in the 1936 Universal Studios film adaptation of \"Show Boat\", as did Jones as Ravenal, McDaniel as Queenie and Robeson as Joe. The film also featured Winninger (Cap'n Andy), Morgan (Julie), White (Frank), and Francis X. Mahoney (Rubberface) recreating their original Broadway stage roles.\n\n\"Show Boat\" was revived by Ziegfeld on Broadway in 1932 at the Casino Theatre with most of the original cast, but with Paul Robeson as Joe and Dennis King as Ravenal.\n\nIn 1946, a major new Broadway revival was produced by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II at the show's original home, the Ziegfeld Theatre. The 1946 revival featured a revised score and new song by Kern and Hammerstein, and a new overture and orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett. The show was directed by Hammerstein and Hassard Short and featured Jan Clayton (Magnolia), Charles Fredricks (Ravenal), Carol Bruce (Julie), Kenneth Spencer (Joe), Helen Dowdy (Queenie), and Buddy Ebsen (Frank). The successful production ran for 418 performances and then toured extensively. Kern, however, died just weeks before the January 5, 1946 opening, making it the last show he worked on.\n\nAdditional New York revivals were produced in 1948 and 1954 at the New York City Center. The Music Theater of Lincoln Center company produced \"Show Boat\" in 1966 at the New York State Theater in a new production. It starred Barbara Cook (Magnolia), Constance Towers (Julie), Stephen Douglass (Ravenal), David Wayne (Cap'n Andy), Margaret Hamilton (Parthy) and William Warfield (Joe). It was produced by Richard Rodgers, and Robert Russell Bennett once again provided a new overture and revised orchestrations.\n\n1983 brought a production at the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C., that starred Mickey Rooney as Cap'n Andy, and another at the Uris Theatre in New York. The latter revival was presented by Douglas Urbanski and starred Donald O'Connor as Cap'n Andy.\n\nIn 1989 the Paper Mill Playhouse of Millburn, New Jersey, mounted a production which was noted for its intention to restore the show in accordance with the creators' original intentions. The production restored part of the original 1927 overture and one number discarded from the show after the Broadway opening, as well as the song \"Ah Still Suits Me\", written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film version. It was directed by Robert Johanson and starred Eddie Bracken as Cap'n Andy. The Paper Mill production was preserved on videotape and broadcast on PBS.\n\nLivent Inc. presented the most recent major production of \"Show Boat\" on Broadway in 1994. Produced and directed by Harold Prince, it premiered in Toronto, Ontario, in 1993 prior to opening in New York on October 2, 1994, at the George Gershwin Theatre. It ran for 947 performances, Broadway's longest-running \"Show Boat\" to date. This production went on tour, playing at the Kennedy Center; and it was also staged in London and Melbourne, Australia. Prince's production revived interest in the show by tightening the book, dropping and adding songs cut in various productions, and highlighting its racial elements. Perhaps the most notable change in the score was Prince's transforming \"Why Do I Love You?\" from a duet between Magnolia and Ravenal to a lullaby sung by Parthy Ann to Magnolia's baby girl. The change was partly to accommodate the song's being performed by stage actress Elaine Stritch. The love duet for Magnolia and Ravenal, \"I Have the Room Above Her\", originally written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film, was added to the production. Two new mime and dance \"Montages\" in Act 2 depicted the passage of time through changing styles of dance and music.\n\nThe original London West End production of \"Show Boat\" opened May 3, 1928, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and featured among the cast, Cedric Hardwicke as Capt. Andy, Edith Day as Magnolia, Paul Robeson as Joe, and Alberta Hunter as Queenie. Mabel Mercer, later famed as a cabaret singer, was in the chorus. Other West End presentations include a 1971 production at the Adelphi Theatre, which ran for 909 performances.\n\nThe Hal Prince production ran at the Prince Edward Theatre in 1998, and was nominated for the Olivier Award, Outstanding Musical Production (1999). Other notable revivals in England have included the joint Opera North/Royal Shakespeare Company production of 1989, which ran at the London Palladium in 1990, and the 2006 production directed by Francesca Zambello, presented by Raymond Gubbay at London's Royal Albert Hall. It was the first fully staged musical production in the history of that venue.\n\nA production was transferred from Sheffield's Crucible Theatre to London's New London Theatre with previews beginning on April 9, 2016, and an official opening on April 25 2016. It was directed by Daniel Evans using the Goodspeed Musicals version of the show. The cast included Gina Beck as Magnolia, Lucy Briers as Parthy Ann and Malcolm Sinclair as Cap'n Andy. Despite very favorable reviews, the show closed at the end of August 2016.\n\n\"Show Boat\" has been adapted for film three times, and for television once.\n\n\"Show Boat\" was adapted for live radio at least seven times. Due to network censorship rules, many of the radio productions eliminated the miscegenation aspect of the plot. Notable exceptions were the 1940 \"Cavalcade of America\" broadcast and the 1952 \"Lux Radio Theatre\" broadcast.\n\n\n\n\nThere have been many other studio cast recordings of \"Show Boat\" in addition to those mentioned above. The soundtrack of the 1936 film version has appeared on a so-called \"bootleg\" CD label called Xeno.\n\n\"Show Boat\" boldly portrayed racial issues and was the first racially integrated musical, in that both black and white performers appeared and sang on stage together. Ziegfeld’s \"Follies\" featured solo African American performers such as Bert Williams, but would not have included a black woman in the chorus. \"Show Boat\" was structured with two choruses – a black chorus and a white chorus. One commentator noted that \"Hammerstein uses the African-American chorus as essentially a Greek chorus, providing clear commentary on the proceedings, whereas the white choruses sing of the not-quite-real.\" In \"Show Boat\" Jerome Kern used the AABA-chorus form exclusively in songs sung by African American characters (\"Ole Man River\", \"Can't Help Lovin' dat Man\"), a form that later would be regarded as typical of 'white' popular music.\n\n\"Show Boat\" was the first Broadway musical to seriously depict an interracial marriage, as in Ferber's original novel, and to feature a character of mixed race who was \"passing\" for white. (Although the musical comedy \"Whoopee!\" (1930), starring Eddie Cantor, supposedly depicted a romance between a mixed-blood Native American man and a white woman, the man turns out to be white.)\n\nThe show has generated controversy for the subject matter of interracial marriage, the historical portrayal of blacks working as laborers and servants in the 19th-century South, and the use of the word \"niggers\" in the lyrics (this is the first word in the opening chorus of the show). Originally the show opened with the black chorus onstage singing:\n\nIn subsequent productions, \"niggers\" has been changed to \"colored folk\", to \"darkies\", and in one choice, \"Here we all\", as in \"Here we all work on the Mississippi. Here we all work while the white folks play.\" In the 1966 Lincoln Center production of the show, produced two years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, this section of the opening chorus was omitted rather than having words changed. The 1971 London revival used \"Here we all work on the Mississippi\". The 1988 CD for EMI restored the original 1927 lyric, while the Harold Prince revival chose \"colored folk\".\n\nThe Paper Mill Playhouse production, videotaped and telecast by PBS in 1989, used the word \"nigger\" when said by an unsympathetic character, but otherwise used the word \"Negro\".\n\nMany critics believe that Kern and Hammerstein wrote the opening chorus to give a sympathetic voice to an oppressed people, and that they intended its use in an ironic way, as it had so often been used in a derogatory way. They wanted to alert the audience to the realities of racism:\n\n\"'Show Boat\" begins with the singing of that most reprehensible word – nigger – yet this is no coon song... [it] immediately establishes race as one of the central themes of the play. This is a protest song, more ironic than angry perhaps, but a protest nonetheless. In the singers' hands, the word nigger has a sardonic tone... in the very opening, Hammerstein has established the gulf between the races, the privilege accorded the white folks and denied the black, and a flavor of the contempt built into the very language that whites used about African Americans. This is a very effective scene... These are not caricature roles; they are wise, if uneducated, people capable of seeing and feeling more than some of the white folk around them.\n\nThe racial situations in the play provoke thoughts of how hard it must have been to be black in the South. In the dialogue, some of the blacks are called \"niggers\" by the white characters in the story. (Contrary to what is sometimes thought, black slavery is not depicted in the play; U.S. slavery was abolished by 1865, and the story runs from the 1880s to the late 1920s.) At first, it is shocking to believe they are allowed to use a word that negative at all in a play... But in the context in which it is used, it is appropriate due to the impact it makes. It reinforces how much of a derogatory term \"nigger\" was then and still is today.\n\nThe word has not been used in any of the film versions of the musical. In the show, the Sheriff refers to Steve and Julie as having \"nigger blood.\" In the 1936 and 1951 film versions, this was changed to \"Negro blood\". Likewise, the unsympathetic Pete calls Queenie a \"nigger\" in the stage version but refers to her as \"colored\" in the 1936 film, and does not use either word in the 1951 film.\n\nThose who consider \"Show Boat\" racially insensitive often note that the dialogue and lyrics of the black characters (especially the stevedore Joe and his wife Queenie) and choruses use various forms of African American Vernacular English. An example of this is shown in the following text:\n\nWhether or not such language is an accurate reflection of the vernacular of blacks in Mississippi at the time, the effect of its usage has offended some critics, who see it as perpetuating racial stereotypes. The character Queenie (who sings the above verses) in the original production was played not by an African American but by the Italian-American actress Tess Gardella in blackface (Gardella was perhaps best known for portraying Aunt Jemima in blackface). Attempts by non-black writers to imitate black language stereotypically in songs like \"Ol' Man River\" was alleged to be offensive, a claim that was repeated eight years later by critics of \"Porgy and Bess\". But such critics sometimes acknowledged that Hammerstein's intentions were noble, since \"'Ol' Man River' was the song in which he first found his lyrical voice, compressing the suffering, resignation, and anger of an entire race into 24 taut lines and doing it so naturally that it's no wonder folks assume the song's a Negro spiritual.\"\n\nThe theatre critics and veterans Richard Eyre and Nicholas Wright believe that \"Show Boat\" was revolutionary, not only because it was a radical departure from the previous style of plotless revues, but because it was a show written by non-blacks that portrayed blacks sympathetically rather than condescendingly:\n\nInstead of a line of chorus girls showing their legs in the opening number singing that they were happy, happy, happy, the curtain rose on black dock-hands lifting bales of cotton and singing about the hardness of their lives. Here was a musical that showed poverty, suffering, bitterness, racial prejudice, a sexual relationship between black and white, a love story which ended unhappily – and of course show business. In \"Ol' Man River\" the black race was given an anthem to honor its misery that had the authority of an authentic spiritual.\n\nSince the musical's 1927 premiere, \"Show Boat\" has both been condemned as a prejudiced show based on racial caricatures and championed as a breakthrough work that opened the door for public discourse in the arts about racism in America. Some productions (including one planned for June 2002 in Connecticut) have been cancelled because of objections.\n\nSuch cancellations have been criticized by supporters of the arts. After planned performances by an amateur opera company in Middlesbrough, England were \"stopped because [they] would be 'distasteful' to ethnic minorities\", a local newspaper declared that the actions were \"surely taking political correctness too far\". A British theatre writer was concerned that \"the kind of censorship we've been talking about – for censorship it is – actually militates against a truly integrated society, for it emphasizes differences. It puts a wall around groups within society, dividing people by creating metaphorical ghettos, and prevents mutual understanding\". Specifically, the cancellation was based on protests of plans to have all the black roles to be played in this production by white actors in blackface, as the company had no black members.\n\nAs attitudes toward race relations have changed, producers and directors have altered some content to make the musical more \"politically correct\": \"\"Show Boat\", more than many musicals, was subject to cuts and revisions within a handful of years after its first performance, all of which altered the dramatic balance of the play.\"\n\nThe 1993 Hal Prince revival, originating in Toronto, was deliberately staged to cast attention on racial disparities; throughout the production, African-American actors constantly cleaned up messes, appeared to move the sets (even when hydraulics actually moved them), and performed other menial tasks. After a New Year's Eve ball, all the streamers fell on the floor and African Americans immediately began sweeping them away. A montage in the second act showed time passing using the revolving door of the Palmer House in Chicago, with newspaper headlines being shown in quick succession, and snippets of slow motion to highlight a specific moment, accompanied by brief snippets of \"Ol' Man River\". African-American dancers were seen performing a specific dance, and this would change to a scene showing white dancers performing the same dance. This was meant to illustrate how white performers \"appropriated\" the music and dancing styles of African Americans. Earlier productions of \"Show Boat\", even the 1927 stage original and the 1936 film version, did not go this far in social commentary.\n\nDuring the production in Toronto, many black community leaders and their supporters expressed opposition to the show, protesting in front of the theatre, \"shouting insults and waving placards reading SHOW BOAT SPREADS LIES AND HATE and SHOW BOAT = CULTURAL GENOCIDE\". Various theatre critics in New York, however, commented that Prince highlighted racial inequality in his production as to show its injustice, as well as to show the historical suffering of blacks. A critic noted that he included \"an absolutely beautiful piece of music cut from the original production and from the movie [\"Mis'ry's Comin' Round\"] ... a haunting gospel melody sung by the black chorus. The addition of this number is so successful because it salutes the dignity and the pure talent of the black workers and allows them to shine for a brief moment on the center stage of the showboat\".\n\nMany commentators, both black and non-black, view the show as an outdated and stereotypical commentary on race relations that portrays blacks in a negative or inferior position. Douglass K. Daniel of Kansas State University has commented that it is a \"racially flawed story\", and the African-Canadian writer M. Nourbese Philip claims:\n\nThe affront at the heart of \"Show Boat\" is still very alive today. It begins with the book and its negative and one-dimensional images of Black people and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.\n\nSupporters of the musical believe that the depictions of racism should be regarded not as stereotyping blacks but rather satirizing the common national attitudes that both held those stereotypes and reinforced them through discrimination. In the words of \"The New Yorker\" theatre critic John Lahr:\n\nDescribing racism doesn't make \"Show Boat\" racist. The production is meticulous in honoring the influence of black culture not just in the making of the nation's wealth but, through music, in the making of its modern spirit.\"\n\nAs described by Joe Bob Briggs:\n\nThose who attempt to understand works like \"Show Boat\" and \"Porgy and Bess\" through the eyes of their creators usually consider that the show \"was a statement AGAINST racism. That was the point of Edna Ferber's novel. That was the point of the show. That's how Oscar wrote it...I think this is about as far from racism as you can get.\"\n\nAccording to Rabbi Alan Berg, Kern and Hammerstein's score to \"Show Boat\" is \"a tremendous expression of the ethics of tolerance and compassion\". As Harold Prince (not Kern, to whom the quote has been mistakenly attributed) states in the production notes to his 1993 production of the show:\n\nThroughout pre-production and rehearsal, I was committed to eliminate any inadvertent stereotype in the original material, dialogue which may seem \"Uncle Tom\" today... However, I was determined not to rewrite history. The fact that during the 45-year period depicted in our musical there were lynchings, imprisonment, and forced labor of the blacks in the United States is irrefutable. Indeed, the United States still cannot hold its head high with regard to racism.\n\nOscar Hammerstein's commitment to idealizing and encouraging tolerance theatrically started with his libretto to \"Show Boat\". It can be seen in his later works, many of which were set to music by Richard Rodgers. \"Carmen Jones\" is an attempt to present a modern version of the classic French opera through the experiences of African Americans during wartime, and \"South Pacific\" explores interracial marriage and prejudice. Finally, \"The King and I\" deals with different cultures' preconceived notions regarding each other and the possibility for cultural inclusiveness in societies.\n\nRegarding the original author of \"Show Boat\", Ann Shapiro states that\n\nEdna Ferber was taunted for being Jewish; as a young woman eager to launch her career as a journalist, she was told that the \"Chicago Tribune\" did not hire women reporters. Despite her experience of antisemitism and sexism, she idealized America, creating in her novels an American myth where strong women and downtrodden men of any race prevail... \"[Show Boat]\" create[s] visions of racial harmony... in a fictional world that purported to be America but was more illusion than reality. Characters in Ferber's novels achieve assimilation and acceptance that was periodically denied Ferber herself throughout her life.\n\nWhether or not the show is racist, many contend that productions of it should continue as it serves as a history lesson of American race relations. According to African-American opera singer Phillip Boykin, who played the role of Joe in a 2000 tour,\n\nStreaming audio\n"}

It can be expressed as an infinite series of sinusoids:\n\nwhere formula_2 is the amplitude of the individual harmonics.\n\nIn SCA however, one decomposes the spectrum into optimized discrete frequencies. As a consequence, and as the period of the sampled function is supposed to be infinite or not yet known, each of the discrete periodic functions that compose the sampled function fragment can not be considered to be a multiple of the fundamental frequency:\n\nAs such, SCA does not necessarily deliver formula_4 periodic functions, as would have been the case in Fourier analysis.\nFor real-valued functions, the SCA series can be written as:\n\nwhere \"A\" and \"B\" are the series amplitudes. The amplitudes can only be solved if the series of values formula_6 is previously optimized for a desired objective function (usually least residuals).\nformula_7 is not necessarily the average value over the sampled interval: one might prefer to include predominant information on the behavior of the offset value in the time domain.\n\nSCA deals with the prediction problem of continuing a frequency spectrum beyond a sampled (usually stochastic) time series fragment. Unlike ordinary Fourier analysis that infinitely repeats an observed function period or time domain, SCA filters the exact composing frequencies out of the observed spectrum and let them continue (resp. precede) in the time domain. \nIn the scientific terminology, therefore preference is given to the term \"continuation\" rather than for instance \"extrapolation\".\n\nAn algorithm is required to cope with several problems: detrending, decomposition, frequency resolution optimization, superposition, transformation and computational efficiency.\n\n\nSince discrete Fourier transform is inherently related to Fourier analysis, this type of spectral analysis is by definition not suitable for spectrum decomposition in SCA. DFT (or FFT) may provide however an initial approximation, which often speeds up the decomposition.\n\n\nAfter decomposition of a discrete frequency, it should be filtered for optimal resolution (i.e. varying three parameters: frequency value, amplitude and phase).\n\n\nCompared to DFT (or FFT), which is characterized by perfect spectral resolution, but poor temporal information, SCA favours temporal information, but yields higher spectrum dispersion. This property shows where the analytic strength of SCA is located. For instance, discrete composing frequency resolution is by definition far better in SCA than in DFT.\n"}
{"id": "46453694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46453694", "title": "Spillings Hoard", "text": "Spillings Hoard\n\nThe Spillings Hoard () is the world's largest Viking silver treasure, found on Friday 16July 1999 in a field at the Spilling farm northwest of Slite, on northern Gotland, Sweden. The silver hoard consisted of two parts with a total weight of before conservation and consisted of, among other things, 14,295 coins most of which were Islamic from other countries. A third deposition containing over of bronze scrap-metal was also found. The three caches had been hidden under the floorboards of a Viking outhouse sometime during the 9th century.\n\nOn Friday 16July 1999, a team of reporters from the Swedish television TV4 were in the socken of Othem on Gotland to film a cultural feature from Almedalen Week. They chose to do a segment on the problem with looting of archaeological sites with archaeologist Jonas Ström acting as their guide along with Kenneth Jonsson, a professor of numismatics, who happened to be on the island at that time. Spillings farm was selected for the filming since about 150 silver coins and bronze objects had been found there earlier by the landowner Björn Engström.\n\nWith filming complete, Ström and Jonsson decided to continue their survey of the field. Twenty minutes after the TV-crew had left, they heard a strong signal from their metal detector, which led them to the smaller of the two silver caches. A couple of hours later and only from the first find, they received another signal from the detector:\n\nThe site was hurriedly cordoned off, back-up crew from the museum was sent for, permission for an archaeological excavation was immediately sought at the County Administrative Board and guards were posted. However, instead of keeping the find a secret, the Gotland Museum decided to go public with the find immediately. During the first weekend, over 2,000 people visited the excavation site.\n\nSome days later, the metal detector indicated a third metal cache approximately from the first find. The archaeologists concentrated on uncovering the two first finds before starting with the third. Due to the size of the hoards and the fragility of the objects, the bottom layers of the depositions were encapsulated in plaster. Only when they tried to lift the finds out of the soil did the archaeologists realize how heavy the hoards were. The smaller weighed and the larger one . An attempt to X-ray the finds at the local hospital failed because they contained so much silver that the X-ray plates remained blank.\n\nThe larger find was intact but the smaller had been damaged by a plough. A previous landowner who visited the excavation commented that he had found metal wires around the find-spot several years earlier, but thinking that they were only steel wire, he had thrown them away. It was therefore concluded that the treasure had originally been even larger.\n\nWith the two first caches taken care of, the third deposition was excavated almost a year after the first discovery. It contained over of bronze scrap-metal, most of which had been partially melted into a 'cake'. This find was deemed even more valuable since very few finds contain such large amounts of bronze intended for smelting.\n\nAdditional excavations were conducted in the summer of 2000 and in 2003-06. Remnants of wood, iron rivets and mounts as well as a lock mechanism were found, leading to the conclusion that the caches had been stored in chests.\n\nAn extended survey and excavation revealed the foundations of a building and indicated that the hoards had been placed under the floorboards of what would probably have been a warehouse, shed or storage rather than a dwelling since it had no hearth. Carbon dating showed that the building had been in use between 540 and 1040. The foundations and the remaining postholes indicated a regular Viking Age structure, about with a slanting sedge-covered roof, much like other similar finds on Gotland. It had been built on an older Iron Age foundation.\n\nThe silver deposits were roughly square-shaped with rounded corners, about , suggesting that they had been in sacks of cloth, leather or pelt, inside boxes or chests of wood. In the bronze deposit were found substantial pieces of wood and iron, such as fittings, ironwork, nails and a lock-device, showing that the bronze had been kept in a sturdy chest. A carbon dating of the chest dated it to approximately 675, making it older than the objects stored inside it.\n\nAlthough silver hoards and treasures are not unusual on Gotland, this was an exceptionally large find. One explanation may be found in the location near some of the island's best and most significant harbours during the Viking Age. The silver in the caches would have been enough to pay the tax to the Swedish king for all of Gotland for five years.\n\nThe following surveys and excavations of the fields surrounding the find-site showed that the site had been inhabited continuously over 1,000 years up until the 19th century. Over 700 more objects were retrieved, such as objects of bronze and copper, fired clay, clothes pins, a piece of glass, tile pieces, chains, needles, glass beads, slag, iron nails, polished semi-precious stones and brick.\n\nThe Spillings Hoard is the world's largest Viking silver treasure. A finder's fee of SEK 2,091,672 (approx. US$242,400) was paid to the landowner for the treasure, although the real value of it is much higher. It was the largest amount of money ever paid for a find in Sweden, according to director of the Swedish National Heritage Board Sven Göthe. The hoard was dated to have been hidden some time after 870–71. The treasure is on permanent display in the Gotland Museum.\n\n, more than of silver from over 700 caches deposited between the 9th and 12th centuries have been found on Gotland. This includes 168,000 silver coins from the Arab world, North Africa and Central Asia.\n\nThe caches contained silver objects ranging from coins, bars, thread and hacksilver to be used as raw material, to jewelry such as fingerings, bangles and pendants. Much of the material had been bundled up to correspond with the mark-weight system of the Viking Age, in which made one mark.\n\nAlmost 60% of the find consisted of 486 bangles or parts thereof, making it the largest ever find of such silver jewellery . Most of the bracelets weighed around 100 grams under the mark-weight system and were of traditional Gotlandic design, a number of them have very detailed ornamentation. There were also bangles of British and Western Scandinavian design as well as plain, undecorated fingerings of Finnish and British design, known as \"ring money\".\nOf the 14,295 coins found, 14,200 were Islamic dirhams, four were Nordic (from Hedeby), one was Byzantine and 23 were from Persia. The earliest, a Persian coin, dates from 539 and the latest from 870. Many of the coins (as well as the bangles) had marks that may have been made when the purity of the silver was tested. There were several imitations and fakes among the coins. The illegal copies were made from good silver, but made in other places than where the originals were minted. All in all, 69 different minting locations from 15 present-day countries were identified in the hoard.\n\nDuring the conservation work of the larger hoard (No 2) it became evident that the larger objects had been placed at the bottom of the cache and the smaller ones, ending with the cut coins, had been strewn on top.\n\nOne of the most noted coins in the hoard, dated to 800, is from the Khazar Kingdom and designated the \"Moses Coin\". According to written sources the Khazars are believed to be Hebrews, but few objects have been found to support this claim. The coin is inscribed with \"Moses is the messenger of God\" instead of the usual Muslim text \"Muhammad is the messenger of God\".\n\nExcavated in the same manner as the silver hoards, the bronze cache was encapsulated on site and transported to the Gotland Museum for further examination. The objects were removed layer after layer from top to bottom until the large melted 'cake', about in diameter was uncovered. Most of the bronze objects were broken, fragmented or partially melted, suggesting that they were kept in the heartwood chest to be used as raw material for new artifacts. Individual finds consisted of parts of, and some complete, necklaces, bangles, fingerings, pins for clothes and mounts for drinking horns. The bronze objects span a period of 200–300 years and are mostly of Baltic origin or possibly Russian with only a few of them Scandinavian. Even though several scholars have been involved in identifying the deposition, no consensus have been reached regarding why the hoard was collected or the dating of it. Two theories are that it was either the stock of a foundryman living on Gotland, or booty from a Viking raid that was hidden under the floor of the outhouse.\n"}

Although criticized for smaller line-up compared to former years, the organizers announced this was \"a decision essential to switch back to the fields and prepare for 2015, which should be the biggest event both by line-up and scale\". Due to heavy rain and storm on the 2nd day of the festival, Chinawoman and Lapalux were cancelled on 7 June and were added to the 8 June line-up.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2013 the festival was held on the Dinamo Arena Stadium. Total attendance was 19 000. With Deep Purple as headliner, the line-up was the biggest happening in the region and received a lot of local and foreign media interest, especially from Armenia, Russia, Turkey and Azerbaijan. Despite this, after the event the organizers of the festival stated their opinion that Tbilisi Open Air belonged more to outdoor fields than Stadiums or any kind of buildings. \"We received invaluable experience, but the heart of the festival stays with the fields\" - stated organizer Achiko Guledani - \"next time we will try to accept the challenge to bring even bigger line-up there.\"\n\n\nThe 2012 event was held on Tbilisi Valley at the outskirts of the city. Headliner of the festival was a legendary Russian band DDT, which caused a lot of local interest. Total attendance was over 50 000, which remains as a record not only in Georgia, but in whole Caucasus region.\n\n\n\nThe 2011 event was held on Tbilisi Hippodrome. Total Attendance was 10 000.\n\n\n\nThe 2009 event was held in Tbilisi, on Sharden Street (May 15) and on local hippodrome (May 16–17). Total attendance was 35 000. As it was the first big happening since 1980 Tbilisi Rock Festival, the festival was covered by foreign media: Times Online, Reuters, El Mundo, Corriere della Sera, Associated Press, Nouvel Observateur etc. 23 bands from nine countries participated in the festival. It served as an important simulator to the local music business and caused a boost in the numbers of new artists.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2012 Tbilisi Open Air started allowing tent camping as an option for festival lodging. The campground site is adjacent to the venue grounds and has its own entrance from the venue. Since then festival receives campers from different countries.\n\nThe festival is held most often in June. Temperatures during the festival's history have ranged from 25 °C in May to 32 °C on June. Tbilisi has mostly welcoming weather in summer and the same holds true for the event.\n\nTbilisi Open Air is run by Altervision Group which mainly consists of former and active musicians/producers. The first concept of the festival was created by Achiko Guledani, Vaho Babunashvili and Beqa Japaridze in 2009. Nowadays the decision making board of Tbilisi Open Air consists of 7-8 people.

The walls are painted with geometric, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic patterns in red, black and white. Some statues and remains of pottery and fabrics can be seen scarcely due to grave robbery before the hypogea were constituted as protected areas.\n\nThe pre-Columbian culture that created this funeral complex inhabited this area during the first millennium A.C. Tierradentro Archaeological park features hypogea dating from 6th to 9th centuries AD. The details in the sculptures and pictoric patterns are similar to the San Agustín culture.\n\nThe park generates significant revenue to the local economy due to the high volume of tourists, both Colombian and foreigners. These sites form a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The site was listed on the World Monuments Fund's 2012 World Monuments Watch list of 100 Most Endangered Sites.\n\n"}

Speech as a means of communication cannot strictly be separated from the whole of human communicative activity which includes the visual and the term 'language' in relation to vision is an extension of its use to describe the perception, comprehension and production of visible signs.\n\nAn image which dramatizes and communicates an idea presupposes the use of a visual language. Just as people can 'verbalize' their thinking, they can 'visualize' it. A diagram, a map, and a painting are all examples of uses of visual language. Its structural units include line, shape, colour, form, motion, texture, pattern, direction, orientation, scale, angle, space and proportion.\n\nThe elements in an image represent concepts in a spatial context, rather than the linear form used for words. Speech and visual communication are parallel and often interdependent means by which humans exchange information.\n\nVisual units in the form of lines and marks are constructed into meaningful shapes and structures or signs. Different areas of the cortex respond to different elements such as colour and form. Semir Zeki has shown the responses in the brain to the paintings of Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Magritte, Malevich and Picasso.\n\nWhat we have in our minds in a waking state and what we imagine in dreams is very much of the same nature. Dream images might be with or without spoken words, other sounds or colours. In the waking state there is usually, in the foreground, the buzz of immediate perception, feeling, mood and as well as fleeting memory images. In a mental state between dreaming and being fully awake is a state known as 'day dreaming' or a meditative state, during which \"the things we see in the sky when the clouds are drifting, the centaurs and stags, antelopes and wolves\" are projected from the imagination. Rudolf Arnheim has attempted to answer the question: what does a mental image look like? In Greek philosophy, the School of Leucippus and Democritus believed that a replica of an object enters the eye and remains in the soul as a memory as a complete image. Berkeley explained that parts, for example, a leg rather than the complete body, can be brought visually to the mind. Arnheim considers the psychologist, Edward B. Titchener's account to be the breakthrough in understanding something of how the vague incomplete quality of the image is 'impressionistic' and carries meaning as well as form.\n\nAbstract art has shown that the qualities of line and shape, proportion and colour convey meaning directly without the use of words or pictorial representation. Wassily Kandinsky showed how drawn lines and marks can be expressive without any association with a representational image. From the most ancient cultures and throughout history visual language has been used to encode meaning: \"The Bronze Age Badger Stone on Ilkly Moor is covered in circles, lines, hollow cups,winged figures, a spread hand, an ancient swastika, an embryo, a shooting star? … It's a story-telling rock, a message from a world before (written) words.\" Richard Gregory suggests that, \"Perhaps the ability to respond to absent imaginary situations,\" as our early ancestors did with paintings on rock, \"represents an essential step towards the development of abstract thought.\"\n\nThe sense of sight operates selectively. Perception is not a passive recording of all that is in front of the eyes, but is a continuous judgement of scale and colour relationships, and includes making categories of forms to classify images and shapes in the world. Children of six to twelve months are to be able through experience and learning to discriminate between circles, squares and triangles.The child from this age onwards learns to classify objects, abstracting essential qualities and comparing them to other similar objects. Before objects can be perceived and identified the child must be able to classify the different shapes and sizes that a single object may appear to have when it is seen in varying surroundings and from different aspects.\n\nThe perception of a shape requires the grasping of the essential structural features, to produce a \"whole\" or \"gestalt\". The theory of the \"gestalt\" was proposed by Christian von Ehrenfels in 1890. He pointed out that a melody is still recognisable when played in different keys and argued that the whole is not simply the sum of its parts but a total structure. Max Wertheimer researched von Ehrenfels' idea, and in his \"Theory of Form\" (1923) – nicknamed \"the dot essay\" because it was illustrated with abstract patterns of dots and lines – he concluded that the perceiving eye tends to bring together elements that look alike (similarity groupings) and will complete an incomplete form (object hypothesis). An array of random dots tends to form configurations (constellations). All these innate abilities demonstrate how the eye and the mind are seeking pattern and simple whole shapes. When we look at more complex visual images such as paintings we can see that art has been a continuous attempt to \"notate\" visual information.\n\nThought processes are diffused and interconnected and are cognitive at a sensory level. The mind thinks at its deepest level in sense material, and the two hemispheres of the brain deal with different kinds of thought. The brain is divided into two hemispheres and a thick bundle of nerve fibres enable these two halves to communicate with each other. In most people the ability to organize and produce speech is predominantly located in the left side. Appreciating spatial perceptions depends more on the right hemisphere, although there is a left hemisphere contribution. In an attempt to understand how designers solve problems, L. Bruce Archer proposed \"that the way designers (and everybody else, for that matter) form images in their mind's eye, manipulating and evaluating ideas before, during and after externalising them, constitutes a cognitive system comparable with but different from, the verbal language system. Indeed we believe that human beings have an innate capacity for cognitive modelling, and its expression through sketching, drawing, construction, acting out and so on, that is fundamental to human thought.\"\n\nThe visual language begins to develop in babies as the eye and brain become able to focus, and be able to recognize patterns. Children's drawings show a process of increasing perceptual awareness and range of elements to express personal experience and ideas. The development of the visual aspect of language communication in education has been referred to as graphicacy, as a parallel discipline to literacy and numeracy. The ability to think and communicate in visual terms is part of, and of equal importance in the learning process, with that of literacy and numeracy. The visual artist, as Michael Twyman has pointed out, has developed the ability to handle the visual language to communicate ideas. This includes both the understanding and conception and the production of concepts in a visual form.\n\n\n\n"}
