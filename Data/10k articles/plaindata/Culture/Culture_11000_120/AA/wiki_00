This usage of \"aiguillette\" derives from lacing used to fasten plate armor together. As such, a knot or loop arrangement was used which sometimes hung from the shoulder.\n\nThese aiguillettes should not be confused with lanyards, which are cords also worn from the shoulder (or around the neck), but do not have the pointed aiguillette tips and are usually of fibre rather than gold or silver wire, and often not braided.\n\nThe modern aglet or shoelace tip and the decorative tips on bolo ties are types of aiguillettes.\n\nPortraits of the 16th and 17th centuries show that aiglets or metal tips could be functional or purely decorative, though many were used to \"close\" seams and slashes that are not always apparent on dark garments in portraits. They were made in matched sets, might be of silver, silver-gilt, or gold, and were worn in masses.\n\nA 1547 inventory of Henry VIII of England's wardrobe includes one coat with 12 pairs of aiglets, and 11 gowns with a total of 367 pairs. The \"Day Book of the Wardrobe of Robes\" of Elizabeth I records items given and received into storage, including details of buttons and aiglets lost from the Queen's clothing. This entry suggests the huge numbers of matching aiglets fashionable forty years later:\n\nLost the 2 of February ... [1582] 1 bunsh of small gold tagges or aglettes from a gowne of black satten at Sittingbourne parcell [part] of uppon the same gowne 193 bunshes\n\nElizabeth's aiglets were variously enameled with white, red, black, blue, and purple details or set with diamonds, garnets, rubies, and those of Anne of Denmark in the early years of the 17th century were larger, shaped in triangles and pyramids. One set of 24 were made three-sided, with \"27 diamonds in the sides and one in the top\", for a total of 642 diamonds in the set. \nThe modern aiguillette derives from the laces used to secure plates of armor together—the breast- and back-plates would be attached on one side with short loops of cord acting as a hinge, and on the other by a longer and more ornate tied one,to support the arm defences. The ensuing knots would hang down the shoulder. (As with combat boots, the longer the lace, the less the need to undo the entire lace.) As armour became more ornamental and less practical, so too did the ties. This would also explain the aiguillettes of varying levels of complexity in the uniforms of the Household Cavalry (see picture above), as opposed to other \"unarmored\" troops.\n\nA version that says that aiguillettes originated in aides-de-camp and adjutants wearing a pencil at the end of a cord hanging from the shoulder has no historical base.\n\nAiguillettes are worn on the right shoulder by armed forces officers serving in specific positions, such as aide-de-camp to the President, the Minister of Defense, each service's chief of staff and unit commanding officers, and by military attachés to Argentinian embassies abroad. The color of the aiguillette may be golden, silver or tan, depending the nature of the assignment.\n\nOlive green aiguillettes are worn with the combat uniform in very special circumstances, such as ceremonies and inspections. Otherwise, aiguillettes are not worn with the combat uniform. A special red aiguillette is worn by the adjutants to the commanding officers of the Horse Grenadiers Regiment (the presidential guard) and the Military Academy. Also, a red aiguillette is worn on the left shoulder by the senior NCO of each Army unit. A thinner, yellow aiguillette is worn on the right shoulder by NCOs who have completed the instructor course.\n\nIn the Navy, adjutants to very senior officers wear golden aiguillettes on the left shoulder.\n\nAiguillettes distinguish officers of Flag, General and Air rank in specific command appointments, Military Attachés and Aides-de-camp. Most senior officers and aides-de-camp to the Governor-General or state governors wear the Aiguillette on the right shoulder, whilst Military Attachés and staff aides-de-camp wear the Aiguillette on the left. Royal Aiguillettes are of plain gold, naval aiguillettes are of blue and gold, army aiguillettes are of red and gold, air force aiguillettes of light blue and gold.\n\nThe Governor-General of Australia, as the Commander in Chief of the Australian Defence Force, is entitled to wear a uniform on which an Aiguillette made of platinum is worn.\n\nAiguillettes with shoulder boards are worn by military aides-de-camp to the Governor General. The aiguillette is gold with brass tags and worn on the right shoulder. Aides-de-camp to the provincial lieutenant governors wear the same gold-pattern aiguilette on the right shoulder, but do not wear shoulder boards. Aiguillettes are worn on the left shoulder by aides-de-camp to generals, flag officers and diplomats. Aides-de-camp assigned to the Sovereign or officers holding a royal appointment wear the aiguillette on the right shoulder. Obsolete-style gold-braid aiguilettes mixed with army crimson, navy blue, or air force blue may also still be worn by aides-de-camp to lieutenant governors, flag and general officers and diplomats who still have them.\n\nThe Danish military uses Aiguillettes for a number of different positions.\n\nThe aiguillettes are worn only with the dress uniform. There are several types of aiguillettes in the French military:\n\nAiguillettes should not be confused with \"fourragères\", which can be worn in the same way on the left shoulder in parade dress.\n\nIn Ghana, aiguillettes form part of the ceremonial uniforms of commissioned officers in the army and other security services including the police, Prisons service, Fire service, customs and immigration. Senior police officers wear white aiguillettes with dark-blue uniforms, prison officers also wear yellow aiguillettes over the official ceremonial number one uniform while customs and immigration officials wear red aiguillettes with olive-green outfits. When worn, the aigullettes denote on-duty status.\n\nAiguillettes are worn by the aides-de-camp to the President and Taoiseach. The President's ADC wears it on the right shoulder, the Taoiseach's ADC on the left.\nCivil Defence (Cosaint Sibhialta) personnel wear a white aiguillette on their dress uniform.\n\nGold aiguillettes are also worn by officers in the Defence Forces with their Mess Dress uniform. They are worn on the left hand shoulder.\n\nIn the IDF, soldiers who wear an aiguillette are mostly instructors.\nList of aiguillette's colors and roles in the IDF:\n\nIn the Israeli Police, policemen mainly wear a black aiguillette, and Israeli Border Police policemen wear a dark green aiguillette.\n\nAiguillettes are worn by honor guard personnel. A single silver aiguillette is worn on enlisted cut uniforms of minor detachments. A single gold aiguillette is worn on officer cut uniforms of minor detachments. A double gold aiguillette is worn on officer cut uniforms of major detachments. All personnel of major detachments wear officer cut uniforms. Also, dembels (demobilized soldiers) often decorate their uniforms with makeshift aiguillettes.\n\nAiguillettes are worn on the right shoulder by officers of certain appointments only. They include the: \n\nAiguillettes are also worn on the left shoulder by musicians of the Singapore Armed Forces Band and the Singapore Police Force Band. Student musicians from both the National Cadet Corps Command Band and National Police Cadet Corps Band similarly wear aiguillettes mirroring the respective parent bodies.\n\nIn Singapore, ADCs who are officers of the Singapore Armed Forces and the Singapore Civil Defence Force wear gold aiguillettes and police officers wear silver aiguillettes. Singapore Armed Forces ADCs wear a gold braid lanyard in lieu of an aiguillette when in No.3 and No.5(T). \n\nAdditionally the newly commissioned ADC badges are worn across all five services' no.4 uniform.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, full aiguillettes are worn by members of the personal staff of the President of Sri Lanka and General officers, flag officers and air officers, while half aiguillettes are worn by the Colonels and Lieutenant Colonels in ceremonial uniforms. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Sri Lanka Police, the Inspector General of Police, wear gold aiguillettes on the right shoulder, while Senior gazetted police officers wear black aiguillettes on the left shoulder in both formal and ceremonial dress.\n\nThere are four types of aiguillette worn by the British Armed Forces.\n\n\nThe aiguillette is worn on the right shoulder by military aides to the President and the Vice President. It is worn on the left shoulder by military assistants to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security, aides to the Service Secretaries (Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy & Secretary of the Air Force), aide to the NOAA Administrator, military attachés, General Staff Corps officers, and aides to flag officers. The cord colors are gold for the Army and silver for the Air Force, gold and blue for the Coast Guard, Navy and NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps,with one braid \"per star\" of the Flag Officer (one for RDML, two for RADM, three for VADM and four for ADM), and gold and red for the Marines, with the number of braids corresponding to the rank of the General Officer similar to the Navy use. The gold cord aiguillette is worn by the directors of the United States Marine Band, while the enlisted personnel wear aiguillettes of white cord.\n\nA red aiguillette is worn on the left shoulder by United States Navy Recruit Division commanders, whereas a blue aiguillette is worn by Recruit Division commanders in training, Recruit Division commanders wearing these are referred colloquially as \"red ropes\" and \"blue ropes\" respectively. The U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard in Washington, D.C. wears a blue aiguillette on summer white uniforms and a white one on winter blue uniforms.\n\nA blue aiguillette is worn on the left shoulder by cadets in charge of quarters at the United States Air Force Academy, as well as by military training leaders at technical training bases. Student airmen leaders at technical training bases (sometimes called \"ropes\" in reference to the aiguillette) also wear aiguillettes, with green representing the lowest level of student leadership, yellow representing the intermediate level of student leadership, and red representing the highest level of student leadership. Students wearing a white rope are commonly referred to as chapel guides, and are charged with providing social or moral support to their fellow airmen. Airmen who wear the black rope are experts in drill, choir, or ceremonies, and pride themselves on appearance and uniform wear. Airmen who wear a blue and white rope are members of the drum & bugle corps for their base. In the United States Air Force, honor guard members wear a silver aiguillette on the left shoulder.\n\nThe aiguillette should not be confused with the fourragère, which is worn by soldiers and Marines who are assigned to units that were awarded certain decorations by the French and Belgian governments for valorous conduct in the First and Second World Wars.\n\nNor should it be confused with the Schützenschnur, a multi-weapon marksmanship decoration awarded by Germany to qualifying soldiers of NATO countries serving in Germany.\n\nA similar, albeit thicker, device, the Infantry Blue Cord, is worn on the right shoulder by all enlisted soldiers and officers in the United States Army whose primary military occupational speciality is infantry.\n\nMany military units wear dress lanyards.\n\n"}

It was commissioned by Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, the future pope Julius II.\n\nThe polyptych includes two levels: the lower one has at center a Nativity scene and, at the sides, two arched panels depicting Michael the Archangel, John the Baptist, Jerome and Saint George, sharing the same background. The upper one as, in the center, a lunette with a \"Crucifixion\", flanked by two small panels, with the Annunciation Angel and the Annunciation to the Virgin, set in a double portico.\n\nThe main scene, that of the Nativity, is perhaps inspired by that painted by Perugino in the Sistine Chapel, which is now lost. The Child is housed in the Virgin's dress, lying on a red cushion; Mary and Saint Joseph are adoring him, flanked by two kneeling angels and, behind, the ox and the donkey. The scene is set inside a perspective portico, while the background includes a series of hills.\n"}
{"id": "2614980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2614980", "title": "Anthony Godby Johnson", "text": "Anthony Godby Johnson\n\nAnthony Godby Johnson is the subject and supposed author of the 1993 memoir \"A Rock and a Hard Place: One Boy's Triumphant Story\". Subsequent investigations suggest that Johnson may have been the literary creation of Vicki Johnson, who purported to be Johnson's adoptive mother.\n\nThe book initially appeared as an autobiography, describing Johnson's survival of an abusive childhood at the hands of his parents and their friends, his adoption by a new family, and his subsequent contraction of HIV/AIDS.\n\nA second, lesser-known book was published under Johnson's name in 1994, a collaboration with Maya Angelou entitled \"Love Letters To Hawaii From Aboard The A-Train\".\n\nWhen several magazines and journalists, including \"Newsweek\" and Keith Olbermann, attempted to investigate the claims of the book and profile Anthony, they contacted the woman who claimed to be his adoptive mother, Vicki Johnson. Suspicion was raised when it was learned that no one other than Vicki Johnson had actually seen Anthony – not his agent, his editor, nor his publicist. Further concerns were raised when a voice analysis expert analyzed calls from \"Anthony\" and identified the voice to be that of Vicki Johnson. As a result of these irregularities, Olbermann hired an investigator, who suggested that there was no Anthony and the story was fabricated.\n\n\"A Rock and a Hard Place\" claimed that Anthony's biological parents were arrested and tried for abusing him, and that his police officer father was killed in prison. An alleged conspiracy of rogue police officers trying to kill Anthony was Vicki Johnson's justification for zealously preserving Anthony's privacy. However, no case matching that description could be found at any social service agency.\n\nMany sources find it medically implausible that Anthony could be alive, given that he has supposedly been living with AIDS for over 19 years. Most long-term survivors are actually living with HIV but had not yet developed AIDS; furthermore the medications that slow the progress of the disease were not known at the time that Anthony's AIDS allegedly became severe.\n\nWith so many similarities between the purported life of Anthony and proven hoaxes such as that of Kaycee Nicole and Kodee Kennings, the prevailing belief is that Anthony never existed.\n\nFurther investigation by snopes.com has turned up still more evidence that Anthony never existed. No birth records are available for Anthony and adoption is a time consuming and lengthy legal process. The state of New York has no record of a boy by that name or fitting that description having ever been adopted by anyone with his supposed adoptive mother's name. Even in a time before computers, it would have been impossible to adopt a child without creating a paper trail. Also, in his book Anthony stated that his biological father was an ex-police officer in New York, and that he had been tried, convicted, and killed in prison. However, no record exists of a police officer with his supposed biological father's name, and the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision lists no inmate by that name having ever been incarcerated, let alone killed in prison. Were these things true, verification could easily be obtained by internet searches or Freedom of Information Act requests. Lastly, no court records exist which list a couple with the names of Anthony's supposed biological mother and father, who were supposedly tried and convicted of the crimes Anthony alleged in his book.\n\nPaul Monette wrote a foreword for an edition of \"A Rock and a Hard Place\", later defending the book's veracity. Armistead Maupin, who wrote a blurb for an edition of \"A Rock and a Hard Place\", later wrote \"The Night Listener\", a novel subsequently made into a film, in which the main character begins correspondence with an HIV-positive boy who is not what he seems. The book parallels Maupin's experience with Johnson. The story was also adapted for a 2002 episode of \"\" entitled \"\", with the child's sex being changed to female and illness to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nOn January 12, 2007, the ABC newsmagazine program \"20/20\" revealed new evidence that Anthony was Vicki Johnson's fictional creation. The photo of \"Anthony\" that Vicki had sent to Anthony's supporters was revealed to be a childhood photo of a healthy adult man who was shocked to find his childhood photo being represented to people as that of Anthony Godby Johnson; one childhood teacher of this man had been Vicki Johnson, who was said to have taken pictures of the children in her class.\n\nVicki Johnson, whose real name was Joanne Vicki Fraginals, had allegedly handed Anthony over to another caretaker in 1997 when she moved to Chicago and married Marc Zackheim, a child psychologist and owner of the \"Associates of Clinical Psychology\". In 2004, Zackheim was indicted for abusing child patients at a treatment center for troubled children in Indiana; his trial began in 2006 at the Marshall County courthouse. He was acquitted of one felony count of practicing medicine without a license and three misdemeanor counts of battery for inappropriately touching boys.\n\nThree years later Zackheim was found in court again, confessing to accepting Medicaid for patients no longer in his clinic, accepting payments before services had been provided or for services never received, billing for therapeutic services when no licensed therapist was on site, billing for more expensive therapy services than provided, and fabricating diagnosis. In 2009 Marc Allen Zackheim was charged and sentenced to prison in federal court on felony charges for aiding and abetting health care fraud.\n\nZackheim died of a heart attack in November 2009 before his sentence was served.\n\nABC subsequently ran an update to the story, which included a 147-page response from Vicki Johnson's lawyer in response to ABC's questions. ABC also reported that Johnson and Zackheim have both died since their original 2007 story. Since the alleged death of Vicki Johnson, Anthony has seemingly vanished and has not been in contact with any of his previous supporters, lending credence to the assertion that he never existed. Since Vicki has supposedly died, the truth or fiction of Anthony and his story cannot be verified, leaving the story without resolution. Though the majority of people now believe that he never existed, there are still some people that believe that Anthony is/was real, and with the death of Vicki Johnson, their claims cannot be completely disproven.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22258399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22258399", "title": "Boat shoe", "text": "Boat shoe\n\nBoat shoes (also known as deck shoes) are typically canvas or leather with non-marking rubber soles designed for use on a boat. A siping pattern is cut into the soles to provide grip on a wet deck; the leather construction, along with the application of oil, is designed to repel water; and the stitching is highly durable. Boat shoes are traditionally worn without socks.\n\nModern boat shoes were invented in 1935 by American Paul A. Sperry of New Haven, Connecticut after noticing his dog's ability to run easily over ice without slipping. Using a knife, he cut siping into his shoes' soles, inspiring a shoe perfect for boating and a company called Sperry Top-Sider. Sperry Top-Siders are still a popular brand of boat shoe today, among many others, including Sebago and Timberland. Boat shoes are worn by both women and men.\n\nBoat shoes are used by sailors, as the name suggests; however, since the 1970s they have become casual footwear in coastal areas of the Netherlands, United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia, China, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Some boat shoes today have traditional white, non-marking soles, though many others today have dark non-marking soles. They usually have a \"moc-toe\" (like a moccasin) construction. They are usually seen as somewhat of a status symbol (owning boating shoes usually denotes the owner of a boat with a deck large enough to walk around on- a moderately expensive vessel)\n\nIn the 1980s through to the early 1990s, they became a fashion trend and returned in 2007-2008 and continuing in the 2000 10's,as a fashion trend and were worn with everyday and dressy wear alike by both boys and girls and men and women. Taking off big time with the upper elementary through middle school, high school, and college crowds. Besides being worn by themselves, many children and adults wear them with socks, especially low-cut, ankle socks and crew in white and many other bright neon and pastel colors. Many schools with uniform requirements allow boat shoes as acceptable uniform shoes. \n\nIn the 1980's through the early 1990's they were worn with the slouch socks trend. They were worn a lot with tight rolled/french rolled jeans to show off the slouch socks. Girls would also wear them with a crew neck or v neck sweater over a turtleneck or a crew neck top with the v neck sweater and leggings with slouch socks over them and Sebagos with many wearing their hair with a hair band or or hair wrap or ponytail and scrunchie and bangs for a comfortable and fashionable look that could be worn casually everyday to school, college, church, hanging out, etc or would look just as in as a dressy casual or dressy informal wear. Sebago, Sperry Top-Siders and Eastland were the three most popular brands at the time and have remained so through the 2008 into 2000 10's fashion trend revival.\n"}
{"id": "41660263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41660263", "title": "Critical making", "text": "Critical making\n\nCritical making refers to the hands-on productive activities that link digital technologies to society.\nIt was invented to bridge the gap between creative physical and conceptual exploration. The purpose of critical making resides in the learning extracted from the process of making rather than the experience derived from the finished output. The term \"critical making\" was popularized by Matt Ratto, an Associate Professor at the University of Toronto. Ratto describes one of the main goals of critical making as way \"to use material forms of engagement with technologies to supplement and extend critical reflection and, in doing so, to reconnect our lived experiences with technologies to social and conceptual critique.\" \"Critical making\", as defined by practitioners like Matt Ratto and Stephen Hockema, \"is an elision of two typically disconnected modes of engagement in the world — \"critical thinking,\" often considered as abstract, explicit, linguistically based, internal and cognitively individualistic; and \"making,\" typically understood as tacit, embodied, external, and community-oriented.\"\nMatt Ratto coined the term in 2008 to describe his workshop activities that linked conceptual reflection and technical making. This concept explores how learning is influenced by the learner's participation towards creating and/or making things within a technological context. Ratto's first publication to use the term was in 2009. Ratto claims that his goal was to connect the conceptual understanding of technology in social life to materialized activities. By situating himself within the area of \"design-oriented research\" rather than \"research-oriented research,\" Ratto believes that critical making enhances the shared experience in both theoretical and practical understandings of critical socio-technical issues. However, critical making should not be reviewed as design, but rather as a type of practice. The quality of a critical making lab is evaluated based on the physical \"making\" process, regardless of quality of the final material production. Prior studies have noted the separation between critical thinking and physical \"making\". Specifically, experts in technology lack a knowledge of art, and vice versa. However it is very important that technology be embedded in a context rather than being left in isolation, especially when it comes to critical making.\n\nThe Critical Making Lab was founded by Matt Ratto in the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto. The Critical Making Lab provides participants tools and basic knowledge of digital technology used in critical making. The mission of the lab is to enhance collaboration, communication, and the practice-based engagement in critical making.\n\nThe main focus of critical making is open design.Open design develops a critical perspective on the current institutions, practices and norms of society, reconnecting materiality and morality. Matt Ratto introduces Critical Making as processes of material and conceptual exploration and creation of novel understandings by the makers themselves. Critical Making includes digital software and hardware. Software usually refers to the Raspberry Pi or Arduino. Hardware refers to a computer, or any other device that facilitates an operation.\n\nIn 2012, Garnet Hertz adopted the term for a series of ten handmade booklets titled \"Critical Making\" published in 2012. It explores how hands-on productive work ‐ making ‐ can supplement and extend critical reflection on technology and society. It works to blend and extend the fields of design, contemporary art, DIY/craft and technological development. In this project, 70 different authors - including Norman White, Julian Bleecker, Dunne & Raby, Daniel Charny, Albert Borgmann, Golan Levin, Matt Ratto, Natalie Jeremijenko, McKenzie Wark, Paul Dourish, Mitch Altman, Dale Dougherty, Mark Pauline, Scott Snibbe, Reed Ghazala and others - reflected on the term and critical responses to the maker movement. Generally speaking, Hertz's use of the term critical making is focused around studio production and the creation of objects as \"things to think with\".\n\nHertz initially set out to make a zine of about 50 pages but was flooded with almost 300 pages of original content from approximately sixty people. It consisted of academic papers, detailed technical projects, interviews and documented pieces of artwork. He then categorised the information into specific topics thereby producing multiple booklets. The booklet itself is a testament to critical making. It was printed using a hacked photocopier and roughly 100,000 pages were manually folded and stapled to create 300 copies of 10 booklets each. The publication asks us to look at aspects of the DIY culture that go beyond buying an Arduino, getting a MakerBot and reducing DIY to a weekend hobby. These books embrace social issues, the history of technology, activism and politics. The project also stems from a specific disappointment. Recently, Make received a grant from DARPA to create \"makerspaces\" for teenagers. Everyone who had assumed that a culture built on openness was antithetical to the murkiness that surrounds the military world was bitterly disheartened. However, CM is not the anti-Make Magazine, it is simply an alternative, a forum for electronic DIY practice to discuss hacking, making, kludging, DIYing in a less sanitized, mass-market way.\n\nIn 2014, Hertz founded \"The Studio for Critical Making\" at Emily Carr University of Art and Design as Canada Research Chair in Design and Media Arts. The facility \"explores how humanities-based modes of critical inquiry – like the arts and ethics – can be directly applied to building more engaging product concepts and information technologies. The lab works to replace the traditional engineering goals of efficiency, speed or usability with more complex cultural, social and human-oriented values. The end result is technology that is more culturally relevant, socially engaged and personalized.\" \n\nIn 2012, John Maeda began using the term while at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD): first as a title for their strategic plan for 2012-2017 and next as part of the title of an edited collection titled \"The Art of Critical Making: Rhode Island School of Design on Creative Practice\" published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Other individuals who use the term critical making to orient their work include Amaranth Borsuk (University of Washington-Bothell), Jentery Sayers (University of Victoria), Roger Whitson (Washington State University), Kari Kraus (University of Maryland), Amy Papaelias (SUNY-New Paltz), and Jessica Barness (Kent State University).\n\nTraditional DIY is criticized due to its costs and standards. DIY products are difficult to spread in lower-income areas where issues of cost and ease are more commonly cited (William, 276). Today, TET increases the technological standard of DIY, enhance the modernity of it, and open up a more practical and advanced area for DIY projects to develop. It is not only a lifestyle choices but also a technological product. \"DIY activity is not for example seen as a coping practice used by those unable to afford to externalise the activity to formal firms and/or self-employed individuals. Instead, and reflecting the broader cultural turn in retail studies, their explanation for engagement in DIY is firmly grounded in human agency\" (Williams, 273).\n\nAccording to DiSalvo and Lukens, \"Speculative design is an approach to design that emphasizes inquiry, experimentation, and expression, over usability, usefulness or desirability. A particular characteristic of speculative design is that it tends to be future-oriented. However this should not be mistaken as being fantasy-like sense, suggesting, that is \"unreal\" and therefore dismissible (DiSalvo and Lukens, 2009).\"\n\nThe term speculative design involves practices from various disciplines, including visionary or futurist forms of architecture, design fiction, and critical design or design for debate instead of referring a specific movement or style. More than just diagrams of unbuilt structures, speculative design aims to explore the space of interaction between culture, technology, and the built environment (Lukens and DiSalvo, 2012, p. 25). Practitioners of speculative design engage in design as a sort of provocation, one that asks uncomfortable questions about the long-term implications of technology. These practices also integrate pairs of concerns that are traditionally separate, such as fact and fiction, science and art, and commerce and academia. This provocation extends to questions about design itself.\n\n3D Printing allows for the relatively cheap and customizable design of objects which are often integrated into critical making projects. There are two types of industrial manufacturing. The first is subtractive manufacturing, which involves shaping a material through a process of chipping / removing some of its substance (think whittling a figure out of wood). The second is additive manufacturing, which is created by adding material into a product. The basic steps of 3D printing are digital design: design the object you want to print using digital design software OR download a design from a website (like Thingiverse, for example), press print and the printer will begin creating a physical version of your digital design. 3D printers use layerization to create objects. 3D printers use a variety of materials to create objects, including plastic, metal and nylon (Flemming, What is 3D printing?). The Makerbot, for example, uses polylactic acid (PLA), a substance derived from corn. The coiled PLA filament is pulled into the machine via a tube and then heated up by the extruder, causing the PLA to melt. This melted material forms the model's layers, which is applied in approximately .02 - 1 millimeter layers. The model is built up until it is finished.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "996149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=996149", "title": "Cultural system", "text": "Cultural system\n\nA cultural system, is the interaction of different elements in culture. While a cultural system is very different from a social system, sometimes both systems together are referred to as the sociocultural system.\n\nA major concern in the social sciences is the problem of order. One way that social order has been theorized is according to the degree of integration of cultural and social factors.\n\nTalcott Parsons, a major figure in sociology, who was the main originator of action theory in the early 20th century, based his sociological theory of action system is built up around a general theory of society, which is codified within a cybernetic model featuring four functional imperatives: adaptation, goal-attainment, integration, and pattern maintenance. The hierarchy of systems is, from least to most encompassing system, respectively, behavioral organism, personality system, social system, and cultural system as well. Ritzer and Goodman (2004) summarize Parsons view, \"Parsons saw these action systems acting at different levels of analysis, starting with the behavioral organism and building to the cultural system. He saw these levels hierarchically, with each of the lower levels providing the impetus for the higher levels, with the higher levels controlling the lower levels.\" In an article, late in life, Parsons maintained that the term \"functionalism\" was an inappropriate characterization of his theory.\n\nThe British Sociologist David Lockwood argued for a contrast between social content and social transmission in his work on social structure and agency. Noting that social systems were distinct in structure and transmission. Lockwood's conceptual distinction influenced Jürgen Habermas' discussion in the classic \"Legitimation Crises\", who made the now famous distinction between system integration and social integration of the lifeworld.\n\nMargaret Archer (2004) in a revised edition of her classic work \"Culture and Agency\", argues that the grand idea of a unified, integrated culture system, as advocated by early Anthropologists such as Bronisław Malinowski and later by Mary Douglas, is a myth. Archer reads this same myth through Pitirim Sorokin's influence and then Talcott Parsons' approach to cultural systems (2004:3). The myth of a unified, integrated cultural system was also advanced by Western Marxists such as by Antonio Gramsci through the theory of cultural hegemony through a dominant culture. Basic to these mistaken conceptions was the idea of culture as a community of meanings, which function independently in motivating social behavior. This combined two independent factors, community and meanings which can be investigated quasi-independently (2004:4)\n\nArcher, a proponent of critical realism, suggests that cultural factors can be objectively studied for the degree of compatibility (and that various aspects of cultural systems may be found to contradict each other in meaning and use). And, social or community factors in socialization may be studied in the context of the transmission of cultural factors by studying the social uniformity (or lack thereof) in the transmitted culture. Cultural systems are used (and inform society) both through idea systems and the structuring of social systems. To quote Archer in this regard:\n\nArcher notes that the opposite may be the case: low cultural logical consistency and high social consistency. Complex societies can include complex sociocultural systems that mix of cultural and social factors with various levels of contradiction and consistency.\n\nAccording to Burrowes (1996), in two recent approaches to the study of culture, in the 1980-1990s, the \"cultural studies\" and \"cultural indicators\" approaches, investigators explored the traditionally functionalist concern of \"cultural systems integration.\" These two approaches could be synthesized in the investigating cultural systems. Burrowes (1996) writes, \"If functionalism offers to this cross-fertilization a focus on the normative orders of society, the cultural indicators approach provides a rigorous methodology, and cultural studies caution a greater sensitivity to social hierarchies.\" Constrained by Merton's middle range theory [note: to be discussed here], the specification of cultural elements and social structures makes possible the investigation of specific cultural and social systems and their interaction.\n\n"}

It was directed and produced by Shu Takumi and Shintaro Kojima, respectively. The game was released for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan in July 2015, with Android and iOS versions following in August 2017; a release outside Japan is not currently planned. A sequel, \"Dai Gyakuten Saiban 2: Naruhodō Ryūnosuke no Kakugo\", was released in 2017.\n\nThe game carries on the courtroom style gameplay of previous installments in the \"Ace Attorney\" series, including the fully 3D environments and character models previously featured in \"\". Like previous titles, the game is divided between investigation, in which players explore areas to gather evidence and testimonies, and courtroom battles, in which players must find contradictions in witness testimonies to find the truth behind a case. Similarly to Takumi's previous game, \"\", the player sometimes have to cross-examine multiple witnesses at the same time.\n\nTrials in the game feature a jury, not just one judge; this also was the case in the fourth case of \"\", however, in \"Dai Gyakuten Saiban\" the jury directly influences the trial. The jurors are able to interrupt the trial at any time to enter their vote of either \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" if they feel the defendant's guilt or innocence, respectively, as been conclusively demonstrated. If every juror has entered a vote of \"guilty\", then the defendant is given a guilty verdict. However, the player is able to present a closing argument after the verdict during which they interview the jurors, attempting to change their minds. If after the closing argument the player has persuaded at least a majority; four out of six, of the jurors to withdraw their votes of guilty, the court acknowledges the misalignment of the verdict, and the trial continues. If they fail, then the verdict stays as is and the trial is adjourned.\nNew to this game is Joint Reasoning, which takes place during investigations alongside Sherlock Holmes. In these segments, Holmes makes quick deductions about a witness, and it is up to the player to point out contradictions in his theories. This will occasionally require the player to inspect the witness from various angles, similar to how certain bits of evidence could be examined in previous installments, in order to find hidden clues that can help lead Holmes to the proper conclusion.\n\nTaking place near the end of the 19th century (known in Japan as the Meiji Period, in Britain as the Victorian era), \"Dai Gyakuten Saiban\" focuses on Ryūnosuke Naruhodō – an ancestor of Phoenix Wright, the primary protagonist of the \"Ace Attorney\" series – who seeks to become a full-fledged defense attorney. Joined by his assistant, Susato Mikotoba, Ryūnosuke travels to England to further his studies, where he encounters world-famous detective Sherlock Holmes and works alongside him in solving mysterious cases.\n\nThe first chapter, The Adventure of the Great Departure, takes place in Japan, and has Ryūnosuke get put on trial for the murder of a Japanese university teacher, Dr John H Watson. He is represented by Asōgi, while the prosecutor is Taketsuchi Auchi, the Meiji Period ancestor of recurring character Takefumi Auchi (Winston Payne in the English localizations). With help from Susato, Ryūnosuke and Asōgi prove that the real murderer is Jezail Brett, an English exchange student who had been studying under Watson at the university, though her motive is left a mystery and she is subsequently released back to England. Following the trial, Asōgi leaves Japan to complete his studies in Great Britain, but has Ryūnosuke travel with him as a stowaway.\n\nIn the second chapter, The Adventure of the Unbreakable Speckled Band, Asōgi hides Ryūnosuke in his baggage and then in his room in order to bring him along to England for Asōgi's debut in the courts. However, while Ryūnosuke is asleep, Asōgi is found murdered within his cabin, and now exposed stowaway Ryūnosuke is once again blamed for the murder. Working with Susato and eccentric passenger Sherlock Holmes, Ryūnosuke discovers that the real killer is Nikomina Borschevitch, a world-famous Russian ballerina who fled Russia, and had unintentionally killed Asōgi by pushing and breaking his neck on his bed's wooden knob after fearfully assuming that he was going to turn her in to the captain (in truth he attempted to introduce her to her fellow stowaway Ryūnosuke as an act of trust and similar circumstances). After the incident is settled, Ryūnosuke persuades with Susato for him to take Asōgi's place as a representative lawyer in Britain, which she agrees to and begins to heavily tutor him on English Law for the remainder of the journey.\n\nThe third chapter, The Adventure of the Runaway Room, has Ryūnosuke and Susato suddenly assigned to defend a philanthropist Cosney Megundal, who has been accused of murdering a bricklayer named \"Thrice-Fired\" Mortar Milverton within a moving carriage, shortly after they arrive in Britain. They go up against Barok van Zieks, a legendary British Prosecutor known as the \"Death God of the Old Bailey\" and are introduced to the British legal system, which uses a jury of 6 people to judge the verdict. During the trial, a smoke bomb is let off, forcing an evacuation of the courtroom. After court resumes, Ryūnosuke and Susato discover evidence proving that Mortar had been killed on the carriage roof, though Zieks claims that this evidence had been forged after the smoke bomb had gone off. He is unable to prove this, and Megundal is subsequently acquitted, though Ryūnosuke remains unsure of Megundal's innocence. Shortly after the trial, Megundal is murdered in a fire.\n\nIn the fourth, The Adventure of Clouded Kokoro, Ryūnosuke and Susato take on the defense of the soon to be famous Japanese novelist Natsume Sōseki, who is currently in London studying English as an nervous exchange student, and has been charged with aggravated assault following a stabbing in the street. During the trial, Ryūnosuke proves that the stabbing was actually the result of a domestic disturbance between landlord John Garrideb and his wife Joan, who had thrown a knife at her husband, only for the knife to fall outside their window and unintentionally hit the victim with it. Sōseki is declared not guilty and explains that he is going to go back to Japan, no longer as nervous of the public as he was before. Sherlock invites Ryūnosuke and Susato to live with him and Iris at 221B Baker Street and set up their law office in their attic.\n\nIn the fifth and final case, The Adventure of the Unspeakable Story the mystery of the third case is returned to, as a bigger game at hand is revealed through the murder of a pawnshop owner, Hutch. It turns of one of the jurors, a \nTelegraph station technician named Robert Crogley, was the son of Mortar Milverton and had the baliff set the fire that killed Megundal. After the case is solved, Susato heads back to Japan.\n\n\n\"Dai Gyakuten Saiban\" was developed by Capcom for the Nintendo 3DS. It was directed by Shu Takumi and produced by Shintaro Kojima, and features character designs and art direction by Kazuya Nuri and music by Yasumasa Kitagawa and Hiromitsu Maeba.\n\nDevelopment began in 2013, a few months after the Japanese release of Takumi's previous project, \"\", when he was asked to work on a new \"Ace Attorney\" game. At one point, he considered having the game focus on civil trials, but remembered a game idea he had come up with earlier: around 2000, he had the idea of a mystery game in which a detective makes incorrect deductions, and where players have to correct the detective and lead him towards the truth. He thought it would be fun to combine the idea with \"Ace Attorney\", but did not expect Capcom to accept the idea.\n\nTakumi had also been wanting to make a Sherlock Holmes game for a long time; because of this, Holmes was part of the concept all the way from the start. According to Takumi, he had several reasons for wanting Holmes in the game: both due to the gameplay, and as a way to separate the game from the main \"Ace Attorney\" series, as Holmes is from a different time period than the one the main series games take place in. This led to Takumi thinking about how Japan was at that time, and lead to new possibilities for the game's mysteries. Initially, Takumi had intended for the game to begin in London, thinking that it would be too much to create a Japanese court only for the prologue; this changed when Nuri said that he thought it should begin in Japan.\n\nTakumi found it challenging to write dialogue and using expressions appropriate for the way the Japanese language was during the Meiji period, as he had to avoid both too old-fashioned and too modern dialogue. As the Meiji period was a time when the lawyer profession was new in Japan, and when there was a lot of focus on becoming a part of \"the new world\" and becoming more Western, Takumi made sure to make the game reflect this. As Takumi had to create a new world for the story to take place in, it took longer than expected to write the game's scenario. The protagonist Ryūnosuke's character was based on how the main series protagonist Phoenix Wright would speak and act if he had lived during the Meiji period. When the development team wrote a list of ideas for names for the protagonist, \"Ryūnosuke\" was the first one to be suggested; it only took a few seconds for them to decide on it. Susato is based on the same concept as that of previous \"Ace Attorney\" heroines: she was designed to be a \"perfect partner\" and fun to spend time with, as the heroines of the series always are by the main characters' side. her name was decided by choosing kanji characters that Takumi found pretty. The development team decided to change \"Sherlock's Watson\" from the original, as they thought it would be more interesting if Watson weren't another English gentleman.\n\nUnlike previous \"Ace Attorney\" games, both characters and environments are fully made in 3D. Like Takumi's earlier game \"\", spotlights light up characters while they dance; this was something that had not been done in previous \"Ace Attorney\" games. Motion capture of the former Takarazuka Revue actress Shiotsuki Shuu was used for some animations; as the \"Ace Attorney\" series is known for its poses and animations, this was chosen as a way to make the animation more dynamic. Nuri designed the characters to make them look simple while also conveying a lot of information. He intended to make the graphics look like illustrations, and wanted to convey the feeling of the materials clothes and items from the Meiji period were made from. Characters were designed to be partially realistic, as realistic animations and facial expressions were needed for the game. Witnesses and jury members were however designed in a more stylized way, to ensure that players immediately recognize them when they see the characters sitting next to each other.\n\nRyūnosuke was designed to have \"the sharp look of a university student\", which went without problems. It did, however, take a long time to design his haircut; Takumi wanted the haircut to be recognizable from Ryūnosuke's silhouette, but said that most people during the Meiji period had simple haircuts. Nuri tried designing various haircuts from that time, and designed around 50 variations. Susato was designed to be an elegant Japanese woman; because of the time period, it was decided that she was to wear a kimono. Takumi had several ideas for various items she could hold, but it was decided that it was best to keep her design simple, as contrast to the English characters. Several different variations were made for Holmes' design, including \"depressed\", \"cute\", \"adventurous\", \"dark\", and \"sleeping\" variations; eventually, they used a variation on how Holmes traditionally is depicted, as contrast to his personality. Additionally, he was given a gun as contrast to Ryūnosuke's sword. Iris' design included gothic elements, as well as elements of a mad scientist, and was created to look good when appearing together with Holmes. Asōgi's clothes were designed with influences from both Japanese and Western cultures. His headband, which flutters in the wind, was something Nuri really wanted in the game, and was something they were only able to do with 3D graphics. Van Zieks was designed to give off a \"dark aura\", with elements of vampires, wolves, and fallen angels.\n\nWhen composing the game's music, Kitagawa used a mindset similar to that when composing for older games, trying to work within limitations to create strong music. He focused on creating catchy melodies, and went through a lot of trial and error. Takumi wanted the music to sound more \"festive\" than the electronic music used in earlier \"Ace Attorney\" games, so he asked Kitagawa to make use of a live orchestra, but with fewer instruments than in the previous game. He also wanted it to sound British, so Kitagawa ended up using sounds similar to chamber music. They did not think piano sounded right for the game, which led to difficulties in differentiating the instruments, as they only had string and wind instruments; because of this, they ended up introducing Spanish elements to the music. As a reference to how Holmes is known for playing the violin, they also tried using violins in the music.\n\nThe game was released by Capcom for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan on July 9, 2015. It was made available in various different editions. A limited edition, which is only sold through Capcom's \"e-Capcom\" store, includes the game, a box based on Holmes' briefcase, Holmes and Iris plush toys, a pin based on the one Ryuunosuke wears, postcards, and a Holmes-themed sticker. Another edition, also exclusive to e-Capcom, includes the game, a soundtrack CD, and a collection of illustrations. Additionally, there is one edition that includes the game and all the bonus items from the other editions. Pre-orders of the game also included a \"Dai Gyakuten Saiban\" theme for the Nintendo 3DS home screen. A limited edition bundling \"Dai Gyakuten Saiban\" with its sequel and a soundtrack CD with music from both games is planned for release on August 3, 2017. The original soundtrack release was published by Capcom in Japan on July 15, 2015. Android and iOS versions of the game were released in Japan on August 30 and August 31, 2017, respectively.\n\nAccording to Capcom France, there were no plans for a Western release of the game as of September 2015. In June 2016, Eshiro said that they want to release the game in the West, and that he is aware of fans asking Capcom for it, but that \"certain circumstances\" are preventing it from happening. A fan translation in the form of subtitled videos was created over the course of eight months and uploaded to YouTube; it was taken down by Capcom in June 2017, but reinstated by YouTube in July 2017 following a counter-notification by the translators.\n\nThe game won VGMO's 2015 Scores of the Year award in the \"Traditional / Acoustic\" category; the music was described as exceeding the \"already high expectations\" for the series, and being streamlined and varied with \"high-quality instrumentation and engaging melodies\".\n\nIn 2014, Takumi said that the game was planned to be the first title in a new series; A sequel, \"Dai Gyakuten Saiban 2: Naruhodō Ryūnosuke no Kakugo\", was announced in September 2016, and was released in Japan for the Nintendo 3DS on August 3, 2017, and for iOS and Android on April 24, 2018. The game won the \"Famitsu\" Awards 2017 in the Excellency category.\n\n"}
{"id": "84941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84941", "title": "Di indigetes", "text": "Di indigetes\n\nIn Georg Wissowa's terminology, the di indigetes or indigites were Roman deities not adopted from other religions, as distinguished from the \"di novensides\". Wissowa thus regarded the \"indigetes\" as \"indigenous\" gods, and the \"novensides\" as \"newcomer gods\". Ancient usage, however, does not treat the two terms as a dichotomy, nor maintain this clear-cut distinction. Wissowa's interpretation is no longer widely accepted and the meaning remains uncertain.\n\nIn classical Latin, the epithet \"Indiges\", singular in form, is applied to Sol \"(Sol Indiges)\" and to Jupiter of Lavinium, later identified with Aeneas. One theory holds that it means the \"speaker within\", and goes back to before the recognition of divine persons. Another, which the Oxford Classical Dictionary holds more likely, is that it means \"invoked\" in the sense of \"pointing to\", as in the related word \"indigitamenta\".\n\nIn Augustan literature, the \"di indigites\" are often associated with \"di patrii\" and appear in lists of local divinities (that is, divinities particular to a place). Servius notes that Praeneste had its own \"indigetes\".\n\nEvidence pertaining to \"di indigites\" is rarely found outside Rome and Lavinium, but a fragmentary inscription from Aletrium (modern Alatri, north of Frosinone) records offerings to \"di Indicites\" including Fucinus, a local lake-god; Summanus, a god of nocturnal lightning; Fiscellus, otherwise unknown, but perhaps a local mountain god; and the Tempestates, weather deities. The inscription has been interpreted as a list of local or nature deities to whom transhumant shepherds should make propitiary offers.\n\nWissowa listed 33 \"di indigetes\", including two collectives in the plural, the Lares of the estate and the Lemures of the dead. Any list of \"indigetes\", however, is conjectural; Raimo Anttila points out that \"we do not know the list of the \"di indigetes\".\"\n\nCarl Koch compiled a list of Latin authors and inscriptions using the phrase \"di indigetes\" or \"Indiges\":\n\n\nC. Koch, A. Grenier, H. J. Rose, Hendrik Wagenvoort, E. Vetter, K. Latte, G. Radke, R. Schilling and more recently R. Anttilla have made contributions to the enquiry into the meaning of the word \"Indiges\" and on the original nature of the \"di indigetes\".\n\nParticularly complete is Carl Koch's analysis which centres mainly on the question of \"Sol Indiges\".\nKoch has argued that \"Sol Indiges\" is the god to which is devoted the \"Agonium\" of December 11 on the grounds of the fragment of the \"fasti\" discovered at Ostia in 1921 which reads ag]ON IND[igeti CIL XIV 4547 and of Johannes Lydus \"de Mensibus\" IV 155: \"...Agonalia daphneephorooi kai genarcheeei Heliooi...\": Agonalia for the laurel bearer and primaeval ancestor Sol, that Lydus compares to a similar custom in Athens terminating with laurel bearing. \"Sol Indiges\" had two festivals, the other one being on August 9 on the Quirinal. He remarks too that the festival of December 11 is in correspondence with the \"Matralia\" of June 11 dedicated to Mater Matuta, considered the goddess of dawn and, in the ritual, the aunt of the sun, son of the night. Koch was the first to advance the hypothesis of the Sol Indiges as the Forefather (Stammvater) of the Roman nation.\n\nAlbert Grenier has contributed a paper in which he expounds the results obtained by Koch and pays more attention to the original nature of the di Indigetes. As Koch had already done he cites the formula of the oath of loyalty to M. Livius Drusus in 91 B.C. by a Latin chief preserved by Diodorus\nSiculus in which are mentioned, after Iuppiter Capitolinus, Vesta and Mars Pater, \"Helios genarchees\" and \"euergetin zooin te kai phytoon Geen\", 'the mother Earth which benefits animals and plants'. Grenier thinks \"Sol Indiges\" and the \"Good Mother Earth\", whom he interprets to be the \"Mater Matuta\" of the \"Matralia\", would be the \"di Indigetes\" of the \"devotio\" of Decius Mus. He goes on to analyse the other testimonies related to the cult of the \"di indigetes\" found in Dionysius of Halicarnassus. The first is the inscription on the monument on the Numicius supposed to be dedicated to \"Aeneas Iuppiter Indiges\" which reads: \"Of the Father God chthonios who rules the flow of the Numicius\". Grenier remarks the inscription does not mention Aeneas and is in fact just a small sanctuary of the god of the river. In this same region Pliny (see above) mentions a \"Sol Indiges\" and Dionysius describes a monument called at his time \"Sanctuary of the Sun\", made up by two altars on an East–West line by a marsh: it was believed to have been erected by Aeneas as a token of thanksgiving for the miracle of the spring. On this evidence Grenier concludes that \"Sol Indiges\" is connected to Lavinium and to the cult of the \"Penates publici\" of Rome, this fact being supported by Varro: \"Lavinium ibi dii penates nostri\". This identification is further supported by the tradition that the new consuls upon entering office sacrificed on this \"Sanctuary of the sun\" to Iuppiter Indiges and by the fact that the formulae of the oaths never mention the \"di indigetes\" along with Iuppiter: e.g. the Table of Bantia reads: \"Iuranto per Iovem deosque Penates\". Grenier concludes from such evidence that the \"Penates\" were included within the \"indigetes\". The Roman \"Penates publici\" were represented as two male youngsters similar to the Dioscures and identified with the gods brought by Aeneas from Troy to Latium. As the true identity of the Indigetes was secret to avoid exauguration Grenier considers a later development the identification with Aeneas and Romulus and thinks the original \"indigetes\" were naturalistic gods, forces like the sun, the earth and the waters which make the wheat and the children grow. Finally he concludes they should have been the \"turba deorum\" of the \"indigitamenta\" which in his view expressed the animistic nature of the most ancient Roman religion.\n\nA relevant point in the discussion of the sources that Grenier has though overlooked is the fact that the inscription quoted in Greek by Dionysius (I 64 end), \"Patros Theoy Chthonioy...\", must translate Latin \"Dei Patrii Indigetis\". For a correspondence see the Greek interpretation of Tages as \"Hermes Chthonios\".\n\nSimilar conclusions have been reached by Hendrik Wagenvoort in his book \"Roman Dynamism\" Oxford 1947, chapter III \"Numen, Novensiles and Indigetes\", p. 73–103, as Grenier acknowledges.\n\nH. J. Rose has refused Koch's interpretation of the di Indigetes as the primordial ancestors (Stammvater) of the Roman nation on the grounds that the formula of Diodorus is not a Roman original but is framed along the Greek fashion and looks to reflect a Greek model.\n\nKurt Latte has supported Carl Koch's thesis that the most ancient Roman religious concepts were based on the natural forces of the sun, moon and waters. He cites and quotes the invocations to the goddess of the Moon at the beginning of every month by the \"pontifex minor\", who repeated for five or seven times the invocation: \"\"Dies te quinque calo Iuno Covella\" or when the Nonae were on the seventh day: \"Septem dies te calo Iuno Covella\". The invocation to the god of the \"Tiber\" during the summer draught: \"Adesto Tiberine, cum tuis undis\"\". These invocations he supposes were justified by a faith in the magic power of words. \"Pater Indiges\" is attested by Solinus (II 15) as referred to Aeneas after his disappearance on the Numicius and Dionysius too makes reference to the Numicius. Latte thinks that it must be the same cult and the question is whether in augustan times the original Pater Indiges was transformed into \"Iuppiter Indiges\". Whereas Dionysius's text may imply the latter interpretation to be the right one Latte thinks the material is insufficient to reach a decision.\n\nThe other occurrence of \"Indiges\" in the singular is that of \"Sol Indiges\" of which two festivals are known as well as the location of his cult on the Quirinal (from the Fasti) one of which is the \"Ag]on. Ind[igeti\" mentioned in the Fasti of Ostia and in Lydus \"De Mensibus\" IV 155. Latte argues that the date of this latter festival does not allow to be brought into any correspondence with the yearly course of the sun, but could perhaps be the day on which sowing should be completed, citing Columella, thus the sacrifice should refer to the power of the sun on vegetation.\n\nLatte concludes that by putting all the above elements together it could be argued that \"Indiges\" might be traced to a representation in which man requests the god to ensure the safety of his sowing. As \"Numicus\" has its parallel with \"Tiber\" so \"Sol\" has its own one in the goddess of the Moon. The naive faith in the influence of celestial bodies has countless parallels even e.g. in Athens.\n\nLatte goes on to say that besides these two there are only instances in the plural which were already not understood by the ancient in Varro's times. The poets of the augustan times had just a vague idea that the word was an archaism that entailed a strong ancient Roman taint in appealing to the gods, without any clear idea of its original meaning. Latte refuses Wissowa's position that it was a central concept in Roman theology, also on the grounds of its irrelevance in the Roman calendar which reflects the most ancient known religious historical representation. The inscription from Sora dating to 4 B. C. could be the issue of augustan restoration and not a proof of an original \"Iuppiter indiges\". Another inscription from Ardea mentions \"novem deivo\" and the context clearly does not allow the interpretation of \"newly imported\", disproving Wissowa's assumptions.\n\nLatte has also enquired into the etymology of the word \"indiges\". He recalls the attempt by Krestchmer to explain it with \"digitus\" (finger) which meets difficulties because in Rome one did not use fingers in invoking the gods and in the common original exit of the ancient singular. The most ancient connection with \"ag-ye\", \"aio\" by Corssen is based on \"indigitare\" (frequentative as \"agitare\" for \"agere\"). However more recent discussions have asked this interpretation into question as such formations are usually found only for monosyllabic verbal themes showing a vocalic shift with a preverbal, such as \"comes\", \"superstes\", \"trames\", which \"aio\" excludes; moreover they have in Latin an active meaning. Also the hypothesis of a retrograde formation from \"indigitare\" meets both linguistic and semantic difficulties: the construction with \"agere\" in the meaning of \"rendering oneself present\" implies an impossible formation from a consonantic shift and the semantics of \"agere\" to render oneself present is highly unlikely for ancient times.\n\nAnother relevant remark by Latte concerns the belief in the effecacy of the divine appellatives, which are sometimes the same for different gods such as \"Heries Iunonis\" and \"Heres Martea\". The Iguvine Tables mention a \"ahtu iuvio\" and a \"ahtu marti\" interpreted as \"Actui Iovio\" and \"Actui Martio\" to which sacrifices are offered. Latte remarks that here the offer is made to the abstract concept of the virtue or power of the god and not to the god himself. Other gods had special entities representing their power as in Rome \"Salacia Neptuni\" and \"Lua Saturni\".\n\nLatte finally refuses the interpretation \"indigetes divi\" for Greek \"daimones\" found in the translation by Macrobius of Hesiod \"Opera\" 121 considering it influenced by late time speculations. The connexion of the gentilician cult of the sun of the Aurelii with that of \"Sol Indiges\" is impossible to prove.\n\nMost recently glottologist Raimo Anttilla has made renewed attempts into the enquiry of the original meaning of the word \"indiges\" in his book on protoindoeuropean root *ag.\n\nHe thinks all the etymological and formal impasses mentioned by Latte could be overcome if one makes the basis of \"indiges\" instead of verb \"aio\" (I say) verb \"ago\" in the sense of to impel, to drive, in this case to drive from within (\"*endo agentes\"). The action of the gods would be that of driving man just as man drives cattle e.g. also in sacrifice (agonium, etymology already cited by Ovid in his \"Fasti\" I 319 ff).\n\nAnttilla bases his analysis on the results of Latte, Radke, Schilling and Ancellotti and Cerri.\n\nOn the basis of this big picture Anttilla attempts to draw a more precise conclusion and overcome the remaining formal difficulties. He argues that holding to the old interpretation of \"indiges\" as 'the caller (forth)' and interpreting the uncertain Umbrian consonant-stem dative plural \"acetus\" 'to the callers forth' as Ancellotti and Cerri do is doubtful and the etymology would be better represented by an *ag- drive than by an *ag-ye say, as the supposed root *kei/*ki is a moving root too and not a calling root. Radke has also proposed the possibility of *en-dhigh-et- grade 0 as in \"figulus\" (from IE stem DHEIG) as a nomen agentis menaing 'forming, shaping, generating from within', close to impelling.\n\nTo support his analysis Anttilla cites a medical term \"indigo/indigere\" meaning to drive bodily fluids, which is not attested in ancient texts. A hard tumor (scirosis) 'fit ex glutinoso et spisso humore quod confluendo ita membris indigitur ut insitus locis ubi considerit unum esse videatur': the tumor is formed by humours that run together to a certain location by pushing the limbs from the inside so as it looks one thing with the limb where they set. So tumors are pushed in as tubers and plants. Although the lexicographic evidence is flimsy Anttilla thinks it is important owing to the close relation between medicine and religion. \"Indiges, indigere\" would hint to something coming out and bringing forth an end result (pushing into a state). Drive in is at the same time come out. The richness of nature deities or their epithets (ahtu) brings about the beneficial result of life/food. The coordinator would be Iuppiter Indiges, the Impeller corresponding to \"Zeus Ageetoor\" at Sparta.\n\nFinally Anttilla considers the worst formal difficulty left that of the suffix -et- and its vowel not rising in indigetes, as remarked by Radke p. 151. Similar formations are merges/mergitis sheaf, ales/alitis winged, mansues/mansuetis tame, seges/segetis cornfield, harvest, produce, two of which pertain to the growing and reaping domain; Anttilla thinks in archaic religious language peculiar forms are often preserved. \"Indigitare\" evoking gods would be to drive them in for our needs and \"Sol Indiges\" would be the force that drives all of nature, particularly food. Radke and Ancellotti e Cerri interpret the -t- form as a kind of active participle or agent noun and this would be the only possibility. Latte too gives as a background for \"indiges\" the general appeal to natural forces in Roman religion, e.g. the summoning of the Moon goddess and other instances.\n\nAt Lavinium in 1958 was excavated an inscription dated to the 3rd century BC reading \"Lare Aineia\" and in 1971 a templet built over a princely cenotaph in the Oriental style of the 7th century BC probably on the site of a \"heroon\" described by Dionysius Halicarnassus. This would support an ancient assimilation of Aeneas to \"Indiges Pater\".\n\n"}

{"id": "466042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=466042", "title": "Décollage", "text": "Décollage\n\nDécollage, in art, is the opposite of collage; instead of an image being built up of all or parts of existing images, it is created by cutting, tearing away or otherwise removing, pieces of an original image. The French word \"décollage\" translates into English literally as \"take-off\" or \"to become unglued\" or \"to become unstuck\". Examples of décollage include etrécissements and cut-up technique. A similar technique is the \"lacerated poster\", a poster in which one has been placed over another or others, and the top poster or posters have been ripped, revealing to a greater or lesser degree the poster or posters underneath.\n\nAn important practitioner of décollage was Wolf Vostell. Wolf Vostell noticed the word \"décollage\" in Le Figaro on 6 September 1954, where it was used to describe the simultaneous take-off and crash of an aeroplane. He appropriated the term to signify an aesthetic philosophy, applied also to the creation of live performances, Vostell’s working concept of décollage, was the Dé-coll/age and begun in 1954, is as a visual force that breaks down outworn values and replaces them with thinking as a function distanced from media. He also called his Happenings Dé-coll/age-Happening.\n\nThe most celebrated artists of the décollage technique in France, especially of the lacerated poster, are François Dufrene, Jacques Villeglé, Mimmo Rotella and Raymond Hains. Raymond Hains used the lacerated poster as an artistic intervention that sought to critique the newly emerged advertising technique of large-scale advertisements. In effect his decollage destroys the advertisement, but leaves its remnants on view for the public to contemplate. Often these artists worked collaboratively and it was their intention to present their artworks in the city of Paris anonymously. These four artists were part of a larger group in the 1960s called Nouveau Réalisme (New realism), Paris' answer to the American Pop Art movement. This was a mostly Paris-based group (which included Yves Klein and Christo and was created with the help of critic Pierre Restany), although Rotella was Italian and moved back to Italy shortly after the group was formed. Some early practitioners sought to extract the defaced poster from its original context and to take it into areas of poetry, photography, or painting.\n\nLacerated posters are also closely related to Richard Genovese's practice of excavations. Contemporary artists employing similar décollage techniques are Mark Bradford, Michael Viviani and Brian Dettmer, who employs a novel method of decollage by removing material from books, leaving behind select images and text to form sculptural collages. Also there is Fizz Fieldgrass, an English artist, who uses digitally enhanced photographic images, overlaid by duplication on either Japanese Conservation Grade or fine Paper Mulberry, torn and rolled back to reveal other layers generating the three-dimensional image.\n\nDécollage is now commonly used in the French language in regard to aviation (as when an aeroplane lifts off the ground). More recently the term has been used in space flight; the web page for ESA indicates its use equivalent to \"We have lift-off!\" at a NASA launch center.\n\nDéchirage (from the French, déchirer: 'to tear') is an artistic style that distresses paper to create a three-dimensional patchwork. It is a form of décollage, taking the original image apart physically through incision, parting and peeling away. Romare Bearden (b. 1911 – d. 1988) the African American collage artist used déchirage as an important element of his abstract expressionist paintings. The first public display of \"Photographic\" Déchirage (the tearing of layers of digital photographs to create a distinctive three-dimensional image) was at the \"Art of Giving\" exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in 2010.\n\nIt can be argued that the depliage is a form of décollage, as it is made by initially removing the staples from a staple-bound magazine.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2576917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2576917", "title": "Evan Almighty", "text": "Evan Almighty\n\nEvan Almighty is a 2007 American fantasy disaster comedy film and the stand-alone sequel and spin-off of \"Bruce Almighty\" (2003). The film was directed by Tom Shadyac, written by Steve Oedekerk, based on the characters created by Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe from the original film, and starring Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham and John Goodman.\n\nProduction of the film began in January 2006. Several visual effect companies were used to provide CGI for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. The main plot is a modern-day retelling of Noah's Ark. By the time the film had completed production, it had become the most expensive comedy film ever at the time; it was later overtaken by \"Men in Black 3\". In October 2007, the film was released on DVD and HD DVD.\n\nThe film grossed less than its budget of $175 million worldwide, and received generally negative reviews. \"Evan Almighty\" was also notable for allegations that the many animals used in the film were treated poorly, but Universal Pictures stressed that the animals' conditions were acceptable.\n\nNewly elected to Congress, former local television news reporter Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) leaves his hometown of Buffalo, New York and later moves to the fictional community of Prestige Crest, Virginia, where his congressional campaign officially declares that he will change the world. Evan prays to God (Morgan Freeman) to give him this opportunity. His wife, Joan (Lauren Graham), also prays that she, Evan and their three sons Dylan (Johnny Simmons), Jordan (Graham Phillips) and Ryan (Jimmy Bennett) will be closer together as a family. On his first day, Evan receives a letter from Congressman Chuck Long (John Goodman), who provides him with a prime office and the opportunity to join Long as the junior co-sponsor to his Citizens' Integration of Public Lands Act (CINPLAN) bill. Over the next several days, strange events in Evan's life occur:\n\n\nEvan comes to realize that this number actually refers to verse 14 in chapter 6 of the Book of Genesis, where God instructs Noah to build an ark in preparation for a coming flood. Although Evan initially rejects this idea, God himself starts appearing to Evan in various guises, assuring him a flood is coming and the only way Evan can save the world will be to save his community instead. Evan himself decides to start building the ark with the tools and materials provided, giving him an opportunity to get closer to his sons, though Joan sees this as a mid-life crisis.\n\nAlthough Evan still maintains his career in Congress, his appearance alienates his staffers Rita Daniels (Wanda Sykes), Marty Stringer (John Michael Higgins) and Eugene Tennanbaum (Jonah Hill), and the animals that follow him everywhere become very disruptive. God reappears and provides Evan a robe, though warns him the flood will come mid-day on September 22. When Evan dons the robe, he finds he is unable to wear any other clothes, the robe seemingly displacing anything else he wears. Outraged by Evan's slothful appearance, Long fires him and his name is removed from the Public Land Act bill. Evan suspects God had him fired to spend more time on the ark, and continues to do so, becoming a public spectacle and of ridicule. Believing that Evan has gone insane, Joan leaves him, although she encounters God in disguise as a waiter at a diner. After hearing her concern about Evan's mental state, God assures Joan that she should see this as an opportunity for the entire family to get closer to each other. Joan is inspired and finally returns to help Evan finish the ark to prepare for the flood.\n\nAs September 22 nears, many people have come out to support Evan's project, including the staffers he had. One shows Evan researches that he had found on Long, specifically that he had planned to build Prestige Crest after damming off a nearby water source, but Long had cut many corners in building the dam. The staffers suspect Long would do the same with the Public Land Act Bill. On September 22, with the ark complete, the police try to destroy the ark with a wrecking ball, as it violates land codes. As animals start to amass near the ark, and rain falls, Evan realizes that the flood will be a result of Long's dam failing, destroying Prestige Crest. He warns the onlookers to either evacuate or get aboard the ark as he loads his entire family and the gathered animals aboard. The dam indeed breaks, destroying all the houses of Prestige Crest, but Evan's foresight saves all the lives there. The ark later floods the streets of Washington D.C. and comes to its final destination in front of the Capitol during the controversial vote of the Public Land Act Bill, interrupting it. This results in Evan accusing Long's cost-cutting for the dam's failure, leading to several other members of Congress voting against the bill.\n\nLong is being put under investigation for his profiteering and ethics, while all the animals are returned to their natural habitats. Evan is finally reinstated in Congress, all the changes forced on him by God no longer remaining. Evan re-encounters God during the hike, and expresses concern that he did not need to build the ark to show the problem with Long's dam, but God retorts that Evan's life is now perfect as he prayed for, being closer to his family and having changed the world for the better through his one Act of Random Kindness (ARK). During the film's closing credits, God issues a new commandment to the outgoing audience: \"Thou shalt do the dance.\" This is later followed by a footage depicting the film's cast and crew members dancing to C+C Music Factory's hit song \"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now).\"\n\n\n\nJon Stewart has a cameo appearance as himself\n\nThe film's screenplay was originally titled \"The Passion of the Ark\" and was written by Bobby Florsheim and Josh Stolberg. It became the subject of a seven-studio bidding war in April 2004. The script was sold to Sony Pictures in a deal worth $2,500,000 plus a percentage of the profits, a record for a spec script from previously unproduced writers. Universal Studios immediately made a deal to co-produce the script with Sony and have Steve Oedekerk rewrite it into the sequel to \"Bruce Almighty\". Steve Oedekerk had been involved with \"Bruce Almighty\" as an executive producer and co-writer of the screenplay (with Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe, who wrote the story). The studio later discarded the original \"The Passion of the Ark\" script completely, and Oedekerk fashioned a new script from scratch (only he received final credit on the finished film as screenwriter). Jim Carrey was asked to reprise his role as Bruce in the sequel and, when he declined, director Tom Shadyac convinced Steve Carell to accept the leading role. Shadyac, reflecting on the first film, stated \"[Carell] delivered some of the funniest stuff in the movie. We thought, 'Why not take that character and spin him off into a different film?'\"\n\nJim Carrey declined to reprise his role from the original \"Bruce Almighty\". Although Carrey did act in a , he has said that he is \"not a big fan of doing the same character twice.\" This marked the third time a sequel has been made to a film for which Carrey declined to reprise his role; the other being \"\" and \"Son of the Mask\".\n\nThe initial budget, at approximately $140 million, led \"Evan Almighty\" to become the most expensive comedy film ever made. Added costs such as set construction, visual effects, and problems with filming multiple animals in a controlled location brought the budget up to $175 million. Once marketing for the film was also included, the film's entire budget was estimated to be around $200 million. The ballooning budget caused Sony to drop the project and hand it over entirely to Universal Studios. Part of the budget was Carell's payroll, where he earned a reported $5 million for his leading role. The Virginia Film Office estimates the film brought $20–25 million to Virginia, with the majority of it in the Charlottesville area.\n\nConstruction of the ark began in January 2006 and the scenes involving the ark were shot in a Crozet, Virginia subdivision called Old Trail. The ark was designed to meet the actual measurements of the biblical ark, measuring long, wide, and high. The ark's layout was also based on pictures in several children's books that crew members had read in their childhoods. When the characters were filmed during the day building the ark or were on location elsewhere, crew members would further construct the ark at night. A concrete base was built to support the weight of the large ark; after filming was completed, the ark was taken down in a week, and the base in another week.\n\nIn disassembling the set, everything that was salvageable from the ark was donated to Habitat for Humanity. \"Leave no trace\" was the slogan used by the director as part of the DVD's bonus features, \"The Almighty Green Set\".\n\nTo create Evan's beard and long hair, three designers would take three hours each day adding individual hairs using prosthetic adhesive and making Carell wear custom wigs. The wigs consisted of both human and yak hair. With his new look, Carell was sometimes nicknamed \"Mountain Man\", \"Retrosexual\", or \"Unabomber.\" For his costumes, designers spoke with textile experts, researched historical information on the clothing that was likely worn at the time of Noah, and used aged fibers for the clothing.\n\nScenes for the film were filmed in various locations in Virginia, including areas in and around Crozet, Waynesboro, Richmond, Charlottesville, and Staunton, though some filming did take place at Universal Studios in Hollywood, California.\n\nFor the CGI used throughout the film, companies Rhythm & Hues (R&H) and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) developed different parts of the film. R&H focused on the animation of the animals, while ILM completed the final scene of the ark rushing through Washington D.C. Lindy De Quattro, the ILM associate visual effects supervisor, revealed that \"This is the first time where we had to do a whole series of shots that were happening mid-day, where you were going to get a really long look at the water and what it was doing.\" The company initially experienced problems creating the water effects and had to develop new tools which would choreograph the movements of the water. In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film \"Poseidon\". Lighting was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a greenscreen stage, and the visual effects company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.\nRhythm & Hues created 300 pairs of animals for use on the ark and fifteen pairs with higher detail for closeup shots. R&H was also assisted by C.I.S. Hollywood, another visual effects company, who provided a large number of composites, involving hundreds of greenscreen animal elements. In scenes where there are multiple species of animals, crew members would film the animals on the greenscreen and R&H and C.I.S would digitally add the animals one at a time, sometimes taking several weeks to a couple of months. Andy Arnett, the animation supervisor, declared that \"The research was extensive. It took six or seven months to perfect the look and feel of the animals before we had the first shot out the door.\"\n\nFor the scene in Congressman Long's office, CGI was used the entire time for the fish that follow Evan around from the fish tank. Cafe FX, the visual effects company hired for the scene, ordered ten different kinds of tropical fish from a local store and studied their movements to imitate them on screen using computer animation. Jeff Goldman, the visual effects supervisor, stated \"Early in the sequence, we mimicked the actual behavior of the fish in our animation, but as the scene plays out, the fish are a counterpoint to Steve Carell's comedic timing.\"\n\nIn late May during production, the media learned that director Tom Shadyac angrily complained to producers, saying \"I'm not seeing any ads, and I don't know why. I'm not getting answers. People are giving me information that isn't true ... I'm only hearing about all the other summer movies, and nothing about mine.\" Shadyac also fired his marketing consultants that he had used for prior films due to his thoughts over the mishandling of the marketing. He later apologized for his outburst with producers, and claimed that it was as a result of his nervousness before the film's release.\n\nGrace Hill Media, a marketing firm that targets religious Americans, held exclusive screenings of the film in mid-June in fifty cities in the United States to reach religious moviegoers. The firm was also used for marketing \"Bruce Almighty\", \"The Da Vinci Code\", and \"The Passion of the Christ\". Grace Hill provided free screenings to blogs in exchange for publicity on the blogs. The film and its subsequent home video release was marketed to Christians and their churches through a \"kindness campaign\" called Ark ALMIGHTY.\n\nThe first trailer of the film premiered on March 29, 2007 for a marathon of \"The Office\", which also stars Steve Carell and Ed Helms. For online advertising, an eight-minute clip of a scene was released on Yahoo! two days before the release of the film. The premiere for the film was held on June 10, 2007 and guests included Adam Sandler, David Hasselhoff, Kate Flannery, Eddie Murphy, Kevin James, and Mindy Kaling, among others.\n\nDirector Tom Shadyac felt the film reflected environmental themes of how humans are stewards of God's creation. In keeping with the themes, \"Evan Almighty\" became NBC Universal's first film to offset the production's carbon emissions. Producer Michael Bostick revealed how the emissions were offset:\n\nWe worked closely with The Conservation Fund to calculate our carbon emissions from what we used on the movie—whether from vehicles used or any of the construction equipment. Once our carbon emissions were calculated, we planted trees that will effectively zero out our climate-changing footprint left behind from the movie.\n\nShadyac accomplished this by requiring crew members to plant 2,050 trees at the Rappahannock River Valley National Wildlife Refuge in Warsaw, Virginia and the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge near Modesto, California. He also bought over 400 bikes for all the cast and crew, to get to work instead of driving. In addition, rather than simply demolishing sets, Shadyac tried to donate houses built for the production and had the Ark set recycled, by donating materials to Habitat for Humanity. During the premiere of the film for cast and crew at Universal Citywalk, the attendees were encouraged to donate to a campaign to plant trees in forests around the world. The after party used recycled cups and plates to offset the use of resources. Shadyac also required that when Industrial Light & Magic developed the climactic scene, that the CGI flood did not appear to harm any of the trees in the scene.\n\nThe film partnered with the website Get On Board Now, which focused on the importance of conservation during production of the film. Donations were taken at the website for The Conservation Fund, which paid for the planting of 15,000 trees.\n\nThe American Humane Association oversaw the 177 species of animals that were used in the film. In scenes including both predators and prey, the animals were digitally added instead to ensure their safety. The American Humane Association gave its permission for the film to display \"No animals were harmed in the making of this movie\" over the closing credits.\n\nAnimal rights organization PETA accused the film's producers of using animals that had previously been abused. Two chimpanzees who appear in the movie, Cody and Sable, were surrendered by their owner to settle a lawsuit that documented allegations of beatings and mistreatment. The film's director, Tom Shadyac, said of PETA's criticisms \"They're not wrong. There's a certain amount of hypocrisy whenever you work with animals, even to show, which we hope we're showing, that respect of all of God's creation ... I don't know. I respect their criticism.\" PETA was also critical of Birds & Animals Unlimited, the primary animal supplier to the film, for alleged serious and continuing violations of the U.S. Animal Welfare Act, including failure to comply with veterinary care requirements and failure to provide shelter from heat and sunlight, which PETA details and claims it can document. A Universal Studios spokesperson declared:\n\nThe live animals used in the filming of Evan Almighty were supplemented by a great number of computer-generated animals, but it would have been impossible to depend on CGI exclusively as some key scenes in the film demonstrate the need for peaceful and productive co-existence between man and animals. One of the most prominent, inescapable messages of the film is the responsibility that humans have to protect and care for animals.\n\nThe film was released on HD DVD and DVD on October 9, 2007 and was the fourth-most rented DVD of the week earning $6.4 million. In the film's first six weeks of release it earned $27,676,676 in domestic DVD sales. The HD-DVD and DVD's special features include deleted scenes, outtakes, cast interviews, and footage of the animals used in the film. The film was released on Blu-ray on August 7, 2012.\n\nMalaysia's Muslim Consumers Association (PPIM) called for a ban on the film, claiming it is offensive to Islam. Secretary-General Maamor Osman claimed that the film was depicting the great flood as comedy and characterized God with the portrayal of a human, both of which are considered blasphemous in Islam. Similarly there was some public protest against \"Bruce Almighty\" being shown in theaters, but that movie was released on DVD and was also shown on television broadcasts. \"Evan Almighty\" was still released in Malaysia on August 23, 2007.\n\n\"Evan Almighty\" received generally negative reviews from critics and viewers. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 23%, based on 192 reviews, with the critical consensus reading, \"Big on special effects but short on laughs, \"Evan Almighty\" underutilizes a star-studded cast that includes Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman.\" At the website Metacritic, which utilizes a normalized rating system, the film earned a score of 37 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nIn his review of the film, Richard Roeper commended Jim Carrey for declining to reprise his role in \"three of the worst sequels of all time\", which included \"\", \"Son of the Mask\" and \"Evan Almighty\". He continued: \"\"Evan Almighty\" is a paper-thin alleged comedy with a laugh drought of biblical proportions, and a condescendingly simplistic spiritual message.\"\n\nSeveral reviewers credit Carell's performance to significantly improving the humor of the film. Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" declared the film the year's Worst Epic on his list of the Worst Movies of 2007. Before \"Evan Almighty\" was released, it was nominated for \"Best Summer Movie You Haven't Seen Yet\" at the 2007 MTV Movie Awards. Competing against seven other nominees, it lost to \"Transformers\". According to box office figures, the film is the second highest-grossing film about \"Supernatural Comedies with Religious Elements\" according to Box Office Mojo, directly behind \"Bruce Almighty\". \"Evan Almighty\" was nominated for one Razzie Award, Worst Prequel or Sequel (lost to \"Daddy Day Camp\").\n\nThough \"Evan Almighty\" was hyped up, especially with churchgoers, and had double the budget of \"Bruce Almighty\", it performed under expectations. On its first weekend, it opened in 5,200 screens in 3,604 theaters and earned $31.1 million (on its first two days the film earned $11.4 million followed by $8.3 million on Sunday). The opening was less than half of the first film's $68 million weekend ($85 million counting Memorial Day). Nikki Rocco, the president of distribution for Universal Pictures declared, \"We never expected it to be much higher ... it is not unusual for family films to open at a level like this and build. This film will have legs.\" The film managed to remain at the third spot at the box office in its second week, before dropping to fifth place in its third week.\n\nInternationally, the film also opened in first place in Russia and Ukraine, earning $1.5 million in Russia with 329 venues and $179,000 in Ukraine at 64 locations. The gross in the opening weekends for the two countries was 10% and 11%, respectively, bigger than the opening for \"Bruce Almighty\". Altogether, the film has earned $173,391,888 worldwide with $100,462,298 in the U.S. and $72,929,590 in the international box office.\n\n\"Evan Almighty: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture\" debuted in 2007. The soundtrack debuted on June 19, 2007. \"Revolution\" was performed by Rascal Flatts in the film. Their version is not on the soundtrack, but it appears as a bonus track on their album \"Still Feels Good\". Also not included on the soundtrack are Elton John's 2006 hit, \"Just Like Noah's Ark\" of which only a little bit is heard during the start of building the ark, and John Mayer's \"Waiting on the World to Change\", used in the main ark-building montage. \"Ready For a Miracle\" was released as a single for the soundtrack by American country pop recording artist, LeAnn Rimes.\n\nRascal Flatts' version of \"Revolution\" peaked at number 57 on the Hot Country Songs charts, and \"The Power of One\" by Bomshel reached number 52 on the same.\n\n\nIn 2008, the soundtrack was nominated for a Dove Award for Special Event Album of the Year at the 39th GMA Dove Awards. The song \"Be the Miracle\" by Room for Two was also nominated for Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year while \"Ready for a Miracle\" by LeAnn Rimes won the Dove Award for Traditional Gospel Recorded Song of the Year.\n\n"}

{"id": "4408111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4408111", "title": "Francophile", "text": "Francophile\n\nA Francophile (Gallophile) is a person who has a strong affinity towards any or all of the French language, French history, French culture or French people. That affinity may include France itself or its history, language, cuisine, literature, etc. The term \"Francophile\" can be contrasted with Francophobe (or Gallophobe), someone who dislikes all that is French.\nFrancophilia often arises in former French colonies, where the elite spoke French and adopted many French habits. In other European countries such as Romania and Russia, French culture has also long been popular among the upper class.\n\nHistorically, Francophilia has been associated with supporters of the philosophy of Enlightenment during and after the French Revolution, where democratic uprisings challenged the autocratic regimes of Europe.\n\nRomania has a long and deeply entrenched tradition of Francophilia beginning after the Enlightenment and Revolutionary periods. No doubt the most famous contemporary Romanian Francophile is Eugen Weber (1925–2007), a prodigious author and lecturer in both English and French on French history. In his book \"My France: politics, culture, myth\", he writes: \"Social relations, manners, attitudes that others had to learn from books, I lived in my early years. Romanian francophilia, Romanian francophony... Many Romanians, in my day, dreamed of France; not many got there\".\n\nWith the efforts to build Romania into a modern nation-state, with a national language and common national heritage, in the 19th century, the Romanian language was deliberately reoriented to its Latin heritage by a steady import of French neologisms suited to contemporary civilization and culture. \"For ordinary Romanians, keen on the idea of the Latin roots of their language, 'Romance' meant 'French.'\" An estimated 39% of Romanian vocabulary consists of borrowings from French, with an estimated 20% of \"everyday\" Romanian vocabulary.\n\nBoia writes: \"Once launched on the road of Westernization, the Romanian elite threw itself into the arms of France, the great Latin sister in the West. When we speak of the Western model, what is to be understood is first and foremost the French model, which comes far ahead of the other Western reference points.\" He quotes no less than the leading Romanian politician Dimitrie Drăghicescu, writing in 1907: \"As the nations of Europe acquire their definitive borders and their social life becomes elaborated and crystallized within the precise limits of these borders, so their spiritual accomplishments will approach those of the French, and the immaterial substance of their souls will take on the luminous clarity, the smoothness and brilliance of the French mentality.\" Bucharest was rebuilt in the style of Paris in the 19th century, giving the city the nickname the \"Paris of the East\".\n\nOther notable Romanian Francophiles include Georges Enesco, Constantin Brâncuși, Emil Cioran, Mircea Eliade, Eugène Ionesco and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel.\n\n18th and 19th century Russian Francophilia is familiar to many from Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\" and \"Anna Karenina\", and his characters from the Russian aristocracy converse in French and give themselves French names. At the time, the language of diplomacy and higher education across much of Europe was French. Russia, recently \"modernized\", or \"Westernized\", by the rule of sovereigns from Peter the Great to Catherine the Great was no exception. The Russian elite, in the early 18th century, were educated in the French tradition and made a conscious effort to imitate the manners of France. Their descendants, a generation or two later, were no longer \"imitating\" French customs but grew up with them, and the strong impact of the French culture on Russian upper and even middle classes was evident, on a smaller scale than in the 18th century, until the Revolution of 1917.\n\n\"Afrancesado\" (lit. \"turned-French\") was the term used for Spanish and Portuguese partisans of Enlightenment ideas, liberalism or the French Revolution. It also denoted supporters of the French occupation of Iberia and of the First French Empire.\n\nIn the 18th century, French was the language of German elites. A notable Francophile was King Frederick the Great of Prussia or Frédéric as he preferred to call himself. Frederick spoke and wrote notably better French than he did German, and all of his books were written in French, a choice of language that was of considerable embarrassment to German nationalists in the 19th and 20th centuries when Frederick became the preeminent German national hero. One source noted: \"Nor did Frederick have any time for German cultural chauvinism. As an ardent Francophile in matters literary and artistic, he took a low view of the German language, spoke it imperfectly himself, and once boasted that he had not read a book in German since his early youth. His preferences in music, art and architecture were overwhelmingly Italian and French\". The French \"philosophe\" Voltaire when he visited Berlin to meet his admirer Frederick noted that everyone at the Prussian Court spoke the most exquisite French and German was only used when addressing servants and soldiers. Another German Francophile was King Ludwig II of Bavaria, a.k.a. \"Mad King Ludwig\". Ludwig felt a great deal of affinity for King Louis XIV of France, the \"Sun King\" and liked to call himself the \"Moon King\" to suggest a parallel between himself and his hero. Ludwig loved to collect memorabilia relating to Louis and his Linderhof Palace was modeled after the Palace of Trianon. An even more strikingly example of Ludwig's architectural Francophila was the Palace of Herrenchiemsee, which was a copy of the Palace of Versailles.\n\nFrancophilia or \"Rattachism\" is a marginal political ideology in some parts of Belgium. Rattachism would mean the incorporation of French speaking Belgium, Wallonia (and sometimes Brussels; more rarely of the entire Belgium) into France. This movement has existed since the Belgian state came into existence in 1830.\n\nThe Manifesto for Walloon culture of 1983 relaunched in 2003, and a series of discussions witnessed a will of emancipation.\n\nThe establishment of the Crusader Kingdom of Cyprus, in 1192, was the beginning of intense French influence on the island for the next three centuries. That influence, which touched almost every aspect of life on the island, would endure even after the end of Lusignan domination. It survives as part of Cypriot culture. The Republic of Cyprus became an associate member of the Francophonie in 2006.\n\nThe Armenians of Cilicia welcomed the Frankish, or French, Crusaders of the Middle Ages as fellow Christians. There was much exchange, and the last dynasty to rule Armenian Cilicia, the Lusignans (who ruled Cyprus), was of French origin.\n\nDuring the reign of Louis XIV, many Armenian manuscripts were taken into the National Library of France. Armenia and Armenian characters are featured in the works of Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau. The first instance of Armenian studies began with the creation of an Armenian department in the School of Oriental languages, at the initiative of Napoleon.\n\nAn important figure of Armenian Francophilia was that of Stepan Vosganian (1825–1901). Arguably the first Armenian \"intellectual\" and literary critic, Vosganian \"represents the prototype of a long line of Armenian intellectuals nurtured in and identified with European, and particularly French, culture\". Educated in Paris, he was a champion of liberalism and the positivist philosophy of Auguste Comte, and he took part in the French Revolution of 1848.\n\nThe French political classes were on the whole supportive of the Armenian national movement. The French–Armenian Agreement (1916) was a political and military accord to create the Armenian Legion in the French Army to fight on the Allied side of World War I, in return for promises of recognition of Armenian independence. The Armenian Legion engaged successfully in Anatolia and Palestine during World War I, particularly at the Battle of Arara and during the Franco-Turkish War.\n\nThe oldest documented possible contact between the two sides was the marriage of Stephen Uroš I of Serbia and Helen of Anjou in the 13th century.\n\nThe first important contacts of French and Serbs came only in the 19th century, when the first French travel writers wrote about their travels to Serbia. At that time Karađorđe Petrović, the leader of the Serbian Revolution, sent a letter to Napoleon expressing his admiration. On the other hand, in the French parliament, Victor Hugo asked France to assist in protecting Serbia and the Serbian population from Ottoman crimes. Diplomatic relations with France were established on 18 January 1879. Rapid development of bilateral relations done that people in Serbia in \"mighty France\" seen great new friend that will protect them from the Ottomans and Habsburgs. Relations between Serbia and France would go upwards until the First World War, when the \"common struggle\" against a common enemy would reach its peak. Before the war, France would win sympathy of local population by building railways by opening of French schools and a consulate and a Bank. Several Serbian kings were at universities in Paris as well as a large part of the future diplomats. Serbs have built a sense of Francophilia because the activities moved them away from the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires. For Serbs until 1914, French have become major allies what were even a threat for traditional inclination towards Russia. The great humanitarian and military assistance that France sent to Serbia during First World War, assistance in the evacuation of children, civilians and military at the end, and the support of French newspaper headlines even today are deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness of large number of Serbs.\n\nNotable Serbian Francophiles include Ilija Garašanin and Sava Šumanović.\n\nThe traditional Anglo-French antagonism has made Francophilia something of a rarity within the United Kingdom, but there have been exceptions.\n\n\n\n\nAs with much of the Western world and the Middle East at the time, Francophilia was quite common in Iran in the 19th century, and even so more in the 20th century. In Iran, many key politicians and diplomats of the 20th century were French-educated or avid Francophiles. Among them Teymur Bakhtiar, the founder of the Iranian intelligence agency, SAVAK; Amir-Abbas Hoveida, Prime Minister of Iran from 1965 to 1977; Hassan Pakravan, a diplomat and intelligence figure; Nader Jahanbani, General under the last Shah; and Abdullah Entezam-Saltaneh, another famous diplomat to the West.\n\nOrientalism first arose in Early Modern France with Guillaume Postel and the French Embassy to the court of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. Later, when Mehmed IV sent the ambassador Müteferrika Süleyman Ağa to the court of Louis XIV in 1669, it caused a sensation that triggered the Turquerie fashion craze in France and then the rest of Western Europe, which lasted until well into the 19th century.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire granted France special privileges on account of the Franco-Ottoman alliance. French mercantilism was protected, French subjects were exempt from the taxes and tributes normally required of Christian residents of the Empire, no French subjects could be taken into Ottoman slavery and French subjects were granted full freedom of worship. Thus, France became the unofficial protector of all Catholics in the East.\n\nIn the late 18th and 19th centuries, French and British colonial influence increased in Anatolia and the Middle East, and the French language and customs penetrated deep into the Ottoman learned classes and aristocracy; French was the preferred second language, rich Ottomans sent their children to school and Universities in France and the Western \"Enlightenment\" was associated with French culture Modern Turkish continues to have many French loanwords that were adopted in this period, and 5,350 Turkish words are of French origin, according to the Turkish Language Society, one eighth of a standard dictionary. List of replaced loanwords in Turkish#Loanwords of French origin Francophilia still exists to a rather limited extent in modern Turkey. Vestiges of the 19th and early 20th century Francophilia include the famous Pera Palace hotel in Istanbul.\n\nThe French Revolution and its ideals of \"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity\" inspired many secular and progressive movements in Ottoman Turkey, including the Young Turk movement that would go on to create the Republic of Turkey. Napoleon's breaking of the age-old Franco-Ottoman alliance by conquering Ottoman-controlled Egypt also had an effect. Muhammad Ali the Great, who became the Ottoman \"vali\" (governor) of Egypt in 1805 and ruled as a \"de facto\" independent ruler until his death in 1848 had been strongly impressed with the Napoleon's \"Armée d'Orient\", and imported French veterans of the Napoleonic wars to train his army. Egypt was very much in the French sphere of influence politically, economically and culturally in the 19th century, and French was the preferred language of Egypt's elites right up to the 1952 revolution. At the court of the Khedive Isma'il Pasha of Egypt, better known as Isma'il the Magnificent the languages used were French and Turkish. Reflecting his Francophilia, the French-educated Isma'il emulated Baron Haussmann by tearing down much of Cairo to rebuild it in the style of Paris. Even today, the architecture of Downtown Cairo closely resembles that of downtown Paris.\n\nIn Lebanon, Franophilia is very common among the Christian Maronites who have seen the 19th century viewed the French as their \"guardian angels\", their special protectors and friends in their struggles against the Muslims. In 1860, the French intervened to put a stop to the massacres of the Maronites by the Muslims and the Druze which were being permitted by the Ottoman authorities, earning them the lasting thanks of the Maronites. Starting in the 19th century, much of the Maronite elite was educated at Jesuit schools in France, making the Maronites one of the most ardently Francophile groups in the Ottoman Empire. The Lebanese writer Charles Corm in a series of poems in French published after World War I portrayed the Lebanese as a \"Phoenician\" people whose Christianity and Francophilia made them part of the West and who had nothing to do either with the Arabs or Islam.\n\nPrince Saionji Kinmochi, a \"genro\" (elder statesmen) was educated in France, where he received a law degree at the Sorbonne. In words of the Canadian historian Margaret Macmillan, Saionji \"...loved the French, their culture and their liberal traditions. He even spoke French in his sleep. To the end of his life, he drank Vichy water and wore Houbigant cologne, which had to be imported specially for him\". Prince Saionji was merely an extreme case of the Francophilia that characterized Meiji Japan. The Justice Minister, Etō Shimpei was an admirer of the French who modeled the legal and administrative systems together with the police force after that of France. A French lawyer Gustave Boissonade was recruited to draft the Japanese legal code, which is why the Japanese legal code today very closely resembles the Code Napoleon. Another French lawyer, Prosper Gambet-Gross served as the special advisor to Kawaji Toshiyoshi who created a French-style police force for Japan. The Japanese educational system from 1872 onward was modeled after the French educational system and in the same year Japan was divided into prefectures as the French administrative system was considered by the Japanese to be the best in Europe. The Japanese received a French military mission in 1870 to train their army as the French Army was considered the best in the world. After France's defeat in the war of 1870-71, the Japanese sent the French military mission home, to be replaced by a German military mission as the German victory led the Japanese to the conclusion that the Germans were better soldiers.\n\nThe Japanese writer Kafū Nagai wrote after visiting France: \"No matter how much I wanted to sing Western songs, they were all very difficult. Had I, born in Japan, no choice but to sing Japanese songs? Was there a Japanese song that expressed my present sentiment -- a traveler who had immersed himself in love and the arts in France but was now going back to the extreme end of the Orient where only death would follow monotonous life? . . . I felt totally forsaken. I belonged to a nation that had no music to express swelling emotions and agonized feelings.\"\n\nColonel Jean-Bédel Bokassa of the Army of the Central African Republic seized power in 1965 and ruled until he was deposed by French troops in 1979. Bokassa was a great Francophile who maintained extremely close relations with France, often going elephant hunting with the French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. In 1977, Bokassa in imitation of his hero Napoleon crowned himself Emperor and renamed his nation the Central African Empire. Bokassa was also notorious as one of Africa's most brutal dictators, engaging in cannibalism, becoming so vicious that even the French could not stand supporting his regime anymore and thus the French Foreign Legion deposed the Emperor in 1979. Bokassa once nonchalantly told a French diplomat after his overthrow about the banquets he used to organize with the French style cooking that: \"You never noticed it, but you ate human flesh.\"\n\nOmar Bongo, the long time dictator of Gabon from 1967 until his death in 2009 was described by \"The Economist\" in 2016 as \"every inch the Francophile\" who was very close to successive governments in Paris from the time he came to power until his death. In 2012, the country declared an intention to add English as a second official language, as Ali Bongo who succeeded his father as president does not share his father's Francophilia. However, it was later clarified that the country intended to introduce English as a first foreign language in schools, while keeping French as the general medium of instruction and the sole official language.\n\nPresident Félix Houphouët-Boigny of the Côte d'Ivoire was described as a \"staunch Francophile\" who maintained very close links with France, and successfully insisted that the French name for his country be used instead of the Ivory Coast. It was Houphouet-Boigny who coined the term \"Françafrique\" to describe the \"special relationship\" between France and its former African colonies, in which Francophone African nations were in the French political, cultural, military and economic sphere of influence, something which Houphouet-Boigny welcomed, though France's influence in Africa has been highly controversial given that most of the African regimes the French supported have been dictatorships.\n\nWith the inception of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the institution of French immersion in many schools following the Official Languages Act of 1969, many Canadians of English heritage have developed a greater appreciation for the French culture that is a part of the Canadian identity. English and French are the two official languages of Canada and two of its founding languages.\n\nIn America, there is great interest in French culture, including French food, art, philosophy, politics, as well as the French lifestyle in general. Historically, French style, particularly that of Paris, has long been considered the height of sophistication by Americans of all social classes.\n\nFrench support of the American Revolution was probably a significant factor in shaping American's feelings towards France. Prior to that, the French had been seen as rivals for control of North America until their decisive defeat in the French and Indian War. With the elimination of France as a major colonial power in North America, the rivalry between American colonists and British interests became primary, and France's role switched to that of a counter to British power.\n\nPro-French sentiment was probably strengthened by the overthrow of the French monarchy and the creation of a \"brother-republic\" in France. Notwithstanding the turmoil of the French Revolution, certain disputes between the two countries, and the renewal of British-American ties, generally good relations continued. During the Napoleonic era, the Louisiana Purchase, and the entry of the United States into another war against Britain, concurrent with Franco-British hostilities, gave a certain sense of common cause.\n\nAmong the most famous early American Francophiles was Thomas Jefferson. Even during the excesses of the Reign of Terror, Jefferson refused to disavow the revolution because he was, as Jean Yarbrough wrote, \"convinced that the fates of the two republics were indissolubly linked. To back away from France would be to undermine the cause of republicanism in America.\" Commenting on the continuing revolutions in the Netherlands and France, Jefferson predicted that \"this ball of liberty, I believe most piously, is now so well in motion that it will roll round the globe, at least the enlightened part of it, for light & liberty go together. it is our glory that we first put it into motion.\" Jefferson would often sign his letters \"Affectionately adieu\" and commented late in life \"France, freed from that monster, Bonaparte, must again become the most agreeable country on earth.\" The 1995 film \"Jefferson in Paris\" by James Ivory, recalls the connection. The \"staunchly Francophile\" Jefferson and, by extension, his adherents or \"Jeffersonians\", were characterized by his political enemies, the Federalists, as \"decadent, ungodly and immoral Francophiles\".\n\nBenjamin Franklin, who spent seven years as the popular United States Ambassador to France was also a Francophile. Massachusetts Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. spent his first three grades in a Parisian school and majored in Romance Languages and Literatures at Harvard. Henry Cabot Lodge Sr., his grandfather, was also a Francophile and befriended Jean Jules Jusserand, the French Ambassador to the US.\n\nMany Americans have studied at art schools in France, including the Beaux Arts academy in Paris, the premier institution of its kind in the country. The students and graduated alumni have been deeply influential on American style, particularly during the 19th and the early 20th centuries.\n\nFrancophile sentiment in America was deeply influential on American public opinion and involvement in both World Wars. The Francophile filmmaker Preston Sturges always considered France his \"second home\" where he spent much of his childhood, was fluent in French and was greatly influenced by the films of his close friend René Clair. On the subject of cuisine, Julia Child is probably the most famous of many Francophile-American chefs and of many American graduates of French cooking-schools.\n\nOther notable francophiles include actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bill Maher, Blake Lively, Natalie Portman, Molly Ringwald, Steven Gabrielle and Robert Crawford. The director and actor Woody Allen is a Francophile whose films often made references to French cinema, philosophy and novels. A recurring theme in Allen's films is the celebration of Paris as the ideal place for romantic love. Allen's 1982 film \"A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy\" frequently pays homage to the work of Jean Renoir while Allen has described François Truffaut as his favorite director. The Francophile hero of Allen's 2011 film \"Midnight in Paris\" Gil Pender bears striking similarities with Allen, leading to reviewers to suggest that the character of Pender is a stand-in for the director-writer.\n\nThe French-American Chamber of Commerce organization has worked to promote business ties between the two countries. A \"Dallas Morning News\" interview has described the Beaujolais Wine Festival, the largest such festival in the US, as a major event for those interested in French culture to mix.\n\nGeneral Antonio López de Santa Anna liked to call himself the \"Napoleon of the West\", and during his rule, the Mexican Army wore uniforms that closely resembled the uniforms of Napoleon's \"Grande Armée\". Since the times of Porfirio Díaz, the Mexican upper class has shown a strong admiration of French culture, language, architecture and customs.\n\nThe Republic of Haiti was once the French colony of Saint-Domingue until a successful slave revolt drove the French out. Despite this history, the Haitian elite was traditionally very Francophile to the point that the Haitian writer Jean Price-Mars published a book in 1928 \"Ainsi Parla l'Oncle\" (So Spoke the Uncle) accusing the elite of \"bovarysme\", of intentionally neglecting and ignoring traditional Haitian folk culture as it had too many West African elements and was not French enough for the elite. About 10% of Haiti's population speak French as their first language while the other 90% speak \"Kréyol\" (a mixture of French and various West African languages) that has often been mocked by the Francophile Haitian elite as a bastardized French. In Haiti, the question of whatever one speaks French or \"Kréyol\" is racially charged as the elite tended to be mulattos while the masses are black.\n\nAustralian people are mostly leaning toward francophilia. Australia is tied to France through history: visit from Lapérouse and assistance during World War I. Australian also appreciate and look up to French culture and cuisine. Shops often try to make their name sound French and a trip to Paris is a common prize in games or often pictured in advertisements.\n\nBastille day is celebrated in Sydney though a 4-days festival, drawing up to 500'000 person.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1071756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1071756", "title": "Gastronomy", "text": "Gastronomy\n\nGastronomy is the study of the relationship between food and culture, the art of preparing and serving rich or delicate and appetizing food, the cooking styles of particular regions, and the science of good eating. One who is well versed in gastronomy is called a gastronome, while a gastronomist is one who unites theory and practice in the study of gastronomy. Practical gastronomy is associated with the practice and study of the preparation, production, and service of the various foods and beverages, from countries around the world. Theoretical gastronomy supports practical gastronomy. It is related with a system and process approach, focused on recipes, techniques and cookery books. Food gastronomy is connected with food and beverages and their genesis. Technical gastronomy underpins practical gastronomy, introducing a rigorous approach to evaluation of gastronomic topics.\n\nEtymologically, the word \"gastronomy\" is derived from Ancient Greek γαστήρ, \"gastḗr\", \"stomach\", and νόμος, \"nómos\", \"laws that govern\", and therefore literally means \"the art or law of regulating the stomach\". The term is purposely all-encompassing: it subsumes all of cooking technique, nutritional facts, food science, and everything that has to do with palatability plus applications of taste and smell as human ingestion of foodstuffs goes.\n\nGastronomy involves discovering, tasting, experiencing, researching, understanding and writing about food preparation and the sensory qualities of human nutrition as a whole. It also studies how nutrition interfaces with the broader culture. Later on, the application of biological and chemical knowledge to cooking has become known as molecular gastronomy, yet gastronomy covers a much broader, interdisciplinary ground.\nThe culinary term appears for the first time in a title in a poem by Joseph Berchoux in 1801 entitled \"Gastronomie.\"\n\nPascal Ory, a French historian, defines gastronomy as the establishment of rules of eating and drinking, an \"art of the table,\" and distinguishes it from good cooking (bonne cuisine) or fine cooking (haute cuisine). Ory traces the origins of gastronomy back to the French reign of Louis XIV when people took interest in developing rules to discriminate between good and bad style and extended their thinking to define good culinary taste. The lavish and sophisticated cuisine and practices of the French court became the culinary model for the French. Alexandre Grimod de La Reyniere wrote the first gastronomic work \"Almanach des gourmands (1803)\" elevating the status of food discourse to a disciplined level based on his views of French tradition and morals. Grimod aimed to reestablish order lost after the revolution and institute gastronomy as a serious subject in France. Grimod expanded gastronomic literature to the three forms of the genre: the guidebook, the gastronomic treatise, and the gourmet periodical. The invention of gastronomic literature coincided with important cultural transformations in France that increased the relevance of the subject. The end of nobility in France changed how people consumed food; fewer wealthy households employed cooks and the new bourgeoisie class wanted to assert their status by consuming elitist food. The emergence of the restaurant satisfied these social needs and provided good food available for popular consumption. The center of culinary excellence in France shifted from Versailles to Paris, a city with a competitive and innovative culinary culture. The culinary commentary of Grimod and other gastronomes influenced the tastes and expectations of consumers in an unprecedented manner as a third party to the consumer-chef interaction.\n\nThe French origins of gastronomy explain the widespread use of French terminology in gastronomic literature. Gastronomic literature, Pascal Ory criticizes, is conceptually vague relying heavily on anecdotal evidence and using confusing, poorly defined terminology. Despite Ory’s criticism, gastronomy has grown from a marginalized subject in France to a serious and popular interest worldwide.\n\nThe derivative \"gourmet\" has come into use since the publication of the book by Brillat-Savarin, \"The Physiology of Taste\". According to Brillat-Savarin, \"Gastronomy is the knowledge and understanding of all that relates to man as he eats. Its purpose is to ensure the conservation of men, using the best food possible.\"\n\nThere have been many writings on gastronomy throughout the world that capture the thoughts and esthetics of a culture's cuisine during a period in their history. Some works continue to define or influence the contemporary gastronomic thought and cuisine of their respective cultures as listed below:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2112007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112007", "title": "Gawai Dayak", "text": "Gawai Dayak\n\nGawai Dayak is an annual festival celebrated by the Dayak people in Sarawak, Malaysia and West Kalimantan, Indonesia on 31 May and 1 June. It is a public holiday in Sarawak and is both a religious and a social occasion recognised since 1957.\n\nGawai Dayak was the concept of the radio producers Tan Kingsley and Owen Liang taken up by the Dayak community. The British colonial government refused to recognise Dayak Day until 1962. They called it \"Sarawak Day\" for the inclusion of all Sarawakians as a national day, regardless of ethnic origin. \n\nOn 1 June 1963, Datuk Michael Buma, a Betong native, hosted the celebrations of the first Gawai Dayak at his home at Siol Kandis, Kuching. On 25 September 1964, \"Sarawak Day\" was gazetted as a public holiday acknowledging the formation of the Federation of Malaysia. The holiday was first celebrated on 1 June 1965 and it became a symbol of unity, aspiration and hope for the Dayak community. It is an integral part of Dayak social life. It is a thanksgiving day marking a bountiful harvest and a time to plan for the new farming season or other endeavours ahead.\n\n\"Gawai Dayak\" comes from \"Gawai\" meaning \"festival\" and \"Dayak\" a collective name for the indigenous peoples of Sarawak, Indonesian Kalimantan and the interior of Borneo. The population estimate is two to four million people. The Dayaks, previously known as the \"Sea Dayak\" are mostly Iban people. Other ethnic groups such as the Bidayuh people (Land Dayak and Orang Ulu) are recognised. The Orang Ulu include the Kayans, Kenyahs and Lun Bawangs. There are over 200 riverine and hill-dwelling ethnic subgroups in the region. Although these peoples have common traits, each have their own dialect, customs, laws, territory and culture. Dayak languages are categorised as part of the Austronesian languages. The Dayaks embraced animism and paganism but in recent times, many have converted to Christianity. \n\nAs the festival day approaches, everyone will be busy with general tidying up, grave visiting, paddy drying and milling, collecting and preparing food and final house decoration, where necessary. The mode of celebrations of Gawai Dayak vary from place to place and preparations begin early. \n\nWhen a longhouse agrees to host Gawai Dayak, they may need to plant extra paddy and organise labour exchange (\"bedurok\"). Rice may be purchased from the towns if the festival is in a place where paddy farming is absent or insufficient. The traditional Dayak liquor is Rice wine called \"tuak\". It is brewed at least one month before the Gawai Dayak. The drink is brewed from the glutinous rice from a recent harvest mixed with home-made yeast called ciping. Traditionally, tuak was made with rice milk only but is now cut with sugar and water in a process called \"mandok\". A stronger alcoholic beverage made by the Ibans is \"langkau\" (called \"arak tonok\" (\"burnt spirit\") by the bidayuhs). This drink is made by distilling tuak over a fire. \n\nTraditional cake delicacies are prepared from glutinous rice flour mixed with sugar. The cakes include \"sarang semut\" (ant nest cake), \"cuwan\" (molded cake) and \"kuih sepit\" (twisted cake). The cakes can last well whilst kept inside a jar because they are deep-fried until hardened. \"Penganan iri\" (a discus-shaped cake) are made just prior to the festival day because they do not keep well. This is because the cake is lifted from the hot frying oil while not fully hardened. The sugar used can be the brown nipah sugar or cane sugar.\n\nBefore the Gawai eve, the longhouse residents may organise a hunting or fishing trip to gather wild meats and fish. Both can be preserved with salt in a jar or smoked over a firewood platform above the hearth. Any wild animal parts like the horns, teeth and claws, and feathers are used to decorate and repair traditional costumes.\n\nThe longhouse is cleaned, repaired and repainted by co-operation amongst its residents, (\"gotong-royong\" in Malay). The longhouse is constructed as a unique place of living and worship. Its main post (\"tiang pemun\") is the designated starting point of all the building materials (\"pun ramu\") and must remain intact. Timber and wooden materials for repairs are obtained from nearby reserve forests (\"pulau galau, pulau ban\") or purchased in towns. A \"pantar\" (long chair) may be built along the upper area of the \"ruai\" (gallery). The seat is raised and the \"tanju\" (verandah wall) is used as the back rest. Some old wooden longhouses (\"rumah kayu\") are renovated with concrete and bricks to make a terraced structure (\"rumah batu\").\n\nThe inside walls of the longhouse are decorated with \"ukir\" murals portraying tree and wild animal motifs. Men with decorating skills make split bamboo designs. Women decorate living room walls by hanging their handwoven ceremonial clothes called pua kumbu and other handycrafts. Orang Ulu are famous for their colourful paintings of the tree of life on their house walls and their house posts are elaborately carved. Highly decorated shields are displayed near the family room door. Heirloom jars, brassware and old human skulls obtained during headhunting raids, if still kept, are cleaned and displayed. Deer horns may be secured on the longhouse posts in order to secure highly decorated swords and other household items.\n\nOn Gawai Eve, people gather sago, aping, sawit or coconut palm shoots which are used for making soup. Vegetables such as wild miding fern, fiddlehead fern, bamboo shoots, tapioca leaves and Dayak round brinjals from nearby jungle, farms or gardens are also gathered. \n\nAfter the gathering of plants and vegetables early in the morning, the poultry is slaughtered. Enough meat is cooked in mid-aged thin-walled bamboo logs to make a traditional dish called \"pansoh\" (or \"lulun\" in the Iban language). The meat is first mixed with traditional herbs like lemon grass, ginger, bungkang leaves and salt. Any remaining meat is preserved in salt and mixed with kepayang leaves and detoxined seeds. Animal heads are roasted over an open fire to be served hot with tuak. Wooden cooking implements are made from small tree logs.\n\nSome glutinous rice is cooked in bamboo logs to soak up the bamboo aroma. Normal rice will be cooked in pots at the kitchen hearth. The addition of pandan leaves gives a special aroma. Smoke from the fire wood also gives a distinctive aroma. Some Dayaks, especially Orang Ulu, will wrap rice in long green leaves before steaming it inside a pot. Rice may also cooked using a gas stove or rice cooker. \n\nHighly decorated mats for guests to sit on are laid out on the longhouse gallery which runs the entire length of the building. The act is called beranyaike which marks the opening of the gawai. The Dayaks make various types of traditional hand-woven mats. There are reed mats woven with colourful designs, \"lampit\" rattan mats, \"bidai\" tree bark mats and \"peradani\" mats. The walls of most family rooms and galleries are decorated with traditional blankets such as the woven \"Pua Kumbu\" and the tied cloth (\"kain kebat\") blankets which are made with unique Dayak designs. During the festival, women are keen to display their skills and hard work at mat-making and hand-weaving. Some traditional baskets are also seen.\n\nMen and women may wear \"nigepan\", the traditional costume, especially when guests are arriving. The traditional dress of men is a loincloth (sirat or cawat), animal skin coat (gagong), peacock and hornbill feathers (lelanjang) headware, chains over the neck (marik), silver armlets and anklelets along with a shield, sword and spear. Men are decorated with tribal tattoos (kalingai or pantang in Iban) which signify their life experience and journey. A frog design on the front of the man's neck and or tegulun designs on the backs of the hand indicate the wearer has chopped off a human head or killed a man in military combat. However, some designs are based on marine life which are meant for protection and rescue of the wearers when on the water. \n\nWomen wear a hand-woven cloth (\"kain betating\") worn around the waist, a rattan and brass ring high corset around the upper body, \"selampai\" (a long piece of scalp) worn over the shoulders, a woven bead chain over the neck and shoulders (\"marik empang\"), a decorated high-comb (\"sugu tinggi\") over the hair lump (\"sanggul\"), a silver belt (\"lampit\"), armlet, anklet and orb fruit purse. In the past, it was customary for Dayak women to have the breasts bare as a sign of beauty. In Bidayuh Dayaks society, Dayung Boris are the maidens of the Gawai Festival.\n\nCelebrations begin on the evening of 31 May with a ceremony to cast away the spirit of greed (\"Muai Antu Rua\"). Two children or men, each dragging a winnowing basket (\"chapan\") will pass each by family's room. Every family will throw some unwanted article into the basket. The unwanted articles will then be tossed to the ground from the end of the longhouse. \n\nAt dusk, a ritual offering ceremony (\"miring\" or \"bedara\") will take place at every family room, one after the other. Before the ceremony, ritual music called \"gendang rayah\" is performed. Old ceramic plates, \"tabak\" (big brass chalices) or containers made of split bamboo skins (\"kelingkang\") are filled with food and drinks to be offered to the deities. \n\nThe Iban Dayaks believe in seven deities (the people of hornbill's nest ie Orang Tansang Kenyalang) whose se names are \"Sengalang Burong\" (the god of war which is represented by the brahminy kite in this world); \"Biku Bunsu Petara\" (the great priest who is second in command), \"Menjaya Manang\" (the first shaman and god of medicine), \"Sempulang Gana with Semerugah\" (the god of agriculture and land), \"Selampadai\" (the god of creation and procreativity), \"Ini Inee/Andan\" (the god of justice) and \"Anda Mara\" (the god of fortune). Iban Dayaks also call upon the legendary and mythical people of Panggau Libau and Gelong, and some good helpful spirits or ghosts to attend the feast. The entire pantheon of gods is cordially invited to the gawai feast.\n\nOfferings to the deities are placed at strategic locations ie the four corners of each family room for protection of souls, in the kitchen, at the rice jar, in the gallery, the tanju and the farm. Other highly prized possessions such as precious old jars and modern items like rice milling engines, boat engines or a car may also be placed with offerings. Any \"pengaroh\" (charm) will be brought out for this ceremony to ensure its continuous effectiveness and to avoid madness afflicting the owner. Wallets are placed among the offerings to increase the \"tuah\" or fortune of the owners.\n\nEach set of offerings usually contains specified odd numbers (ie 1, 3, 5, 7) of traditional items: the cigarette nipah leaves and tobacco, betel nut and sireh leaves, glutinous rice in a hand-woven leave container (\"senupat\"), rice cakes (\"tumpi\"), \"sungki\" (glutinous rice cooked in buwan leaves), glutinuos rice cooked in bamboo logs (\"asi pulut lulun\"), \"penganan iri\" (cakes of glutinous rice flour mixed with \"nipah\" sugar), ant nest cakes and moulded cakes, poprice (made from glutinous paddy grains heated in a wok or pot), hard-boiled chicken eggs and \"tuak\" rice wine poured over or contained in a small bamboo cup.\n\nAfter all the offering sets are completed, the chief of the festival thanks the gods for a good harvest, and asks for guidance, blessings and long life as he waves a cockerel over the offerings (\"bebiau\"). The cockerel is sacrificed by slicing its neck. Its wing feathers are pulled out and brushed onto its bleeding neck after which each feather is placed as a sacrifice (\"genselan\") onto each of the offering sets. The offerings are then placed at the designated locations..\n\nOnce the offering ceremony is completed, the family sits down for dinner, the \"makai di ruai\" (meal at gallery) or makai rami\" (festival meal) in the gallery of the longhouse. Each family member has contributed something. All the best traditional foods, delicacies and drinks that have been prepared are displayed. \n\nJust before midnight, a spirit-welcoming procession (\"Ngalu Petara\") is performed several times up and down the gallery. A beauty pageant to choose the festival's queen and king (Kumang and Keling Gawai) is sometimes conducted. The winners are chosen for completeness of their traditional costumes and beauty. The chief and elders hold a \"begeliga\" to remind everybody to keep order, peace and harmony. Heavy fines (\"ukom\") are imposed on those who break the customary \"adat\" and festive ground rules with fighting, quarrelling, drunkenness or vandalism. \n\nAt midnight, a gong is rung to call the guests to attention. The longhouse chief (\"tuai rumah\") or host will lead a toast to longevity (\"Ai Pengayu\") and the new year with a short prayer (\"sampi\"). The festival greeting, \"Gayu Guru, Gerai Nyamai, Senang Lantang Nguan Menua\" is repeated to each other. Mistakes and quarrels are forgiven. Where a bard is available, he may be asked to recite a short chant called \"timang ai pengayu\" to bless the longevity water before the chief says the short prayer.\n\nAfter dinner, celebrations are less formal. A tree of life (\"ranyai\") is erected in the gallery as a backdrop to performances of the \"ngajat\" dance, sword dance (\"bepencha\") or self-defence martial art (\"bekuntau\"). An important activity after dinner is the \"badigir\", a lining up of guests, perhaps according to their social rank. A woman sings while others in their costumes offer the men a bowl (\"jalong\") of tuak and some \"tabas\" (delicacies). The winner is awarded a coconut symbolizing a trophy head skull. There may be several line-ups for groups of senior men, youth, and women. In another event, the young finish the tuak from a medium-sized jar (\"kebok\") and in return they are requested to donate some money as a token of their appreciation. \n\nAnother important activity is the singing of traditional poems. These include pantun, ramban, jawang, sanggai and pelandai. Honoured guests may be asked to break up a coconut to symbolise the actions of Sengalang Burong (the god of war) during the Iban timang incantation which is called \"ngelanpang\" (chopping off the head skull to present various kinds of beneficial seeds to humankind). Other activities include (blowpipe) sumpit contests, mini sports and traditional games such as tuak drinking, arm-wrestling (bibat lengan), small log pulling (betarit lampong), rope pulling (tarit tali) and foot-banging (bapatis). Some engage in cockfighting. Mini sports include football, \"sepak takraw\" (rattan kickball) and futsal. Other games are egg-rolling, plate passing according to the taboh music, running in gunny sacks and balloon blowing and karaoke and joget dance.\n\nThere are many variations of the traditional ngajat dance. The male and female dances consist of graceful and precise movements of the body, hands and feet with occasional shouts of a battle cry. Examples are the \"ngajat lesong\" (rice mortar dance) and the warrior dance for men. Women perform the \"ngajat pua kumbu\" (ritual cloth dance). The male dance shows strength and bravery and may imitate the movements of a hornbill which is regarded as the king of worldly birds. The ngajat dance is accompanied by a traditional band consisting of an \"engkerumong\" set (percussion), \"tawak\" (big gong), \"bebendai\" (small gong) and \"bedup\" (drum). The Orang Ulu music is played using the \"sape\". Recordings of the tunes may be used instead of a band.\n\nBidayuh Dayak dances include the \"tolak bala\" (danger repealing), a dance performed before the harvest to ask for blessing and protection of the community; the \"totokng\" dance that is performed during the harvest festival to welcome the paddy soul and guests; the \"langi julang\" which is performed at the closing of the harvest festival to thank gods for bestowing good health and a rich harvest; and the eagle-warrior fight dance performed after the harvest season. Hands are held outstretched imitating the movements of the eagles as they flap their wings in flight. The eagle eventually falls unconscious so leaving the warrior as the winner. It is performed by men seeking a female partner.\n\nOn the first day of June, Dayak homes are opened to guests. This practice is called \"ngabang\". Open houses may also be organised by Dayak associations or non-government organisations. This will continue until the end of June where the gawai will be closed in a \"ngiling bidai\" (mat rolling up) ceremony. \n\nWhen guests arrive, tuak is offered and women line up in two rows on each side of the ladder \"nyambut pengabang\". The welcoming drink (\"ai tiki\") is followed by the thirst-quenching drink (\"ai aus\"). Then, when the guests are seated, further rounds of tuak as a washing drink (\"ai basu\"), profit drink (\"ai untong\") and respect drink (\"ai basa\") are given. This activity is called the watering of guests or \"nyibur temuai\". \n\nSpeeches are made such as the \"jaku ansah\" (sharpening speech) which introduces the guest of honor. The guest of honor is received with a \"miring\" offering ceremony outside the longhouse. Upon approaching the longhouse ladder, the guest of honor is asked to \"open a fort\" (\"muka kuta\"). This is represented by the slashing of a bamboo fence with a sword and a poem. Then, at the foot of the longhouse ladder, an animal is speared (\"mankan\"). \n\nIn \"ngalu pengabang\", guests led by \"ngajat\" dancers and followed by the band, process to their seats in the longhouse gallery. After that, a guest prayer (\"biau pengabang\") is recited by a talented speaker like the headman or the \"lemambang\" bard while he sways holding a chicken over the heads of guests. Before the guests are offered foods, a special speech (called \"muka kujuk\" in Iban) to open the traditional cloth covering over food containers is recited. \n\nAfter eating, the families of the longhouse are visited by guests. A short longhouse may have ten to thirty family rooms while moderately long may have thirty to fifty family rooms. A very long longhouse may have fifty to one hundred family rooms. It is common for Dayaks to discuss their genealogy (\"tusut in Iban\"). In the activity called \"bantil\" (persuaded drinking), women offer drinks to men to help them overcome shyness. Men traditionally reject the first offers as a sign of respect to the host. Women sing a traditional poem called \"pantun\" while offering tuak. In the activity called \"uti\", a special guest is asked to open a coconut placed on a ceramic plate using a blunt knife without handling the coconut or breaking the plate. The coconut tells of someone's heart and fate: white flesh is good and black flesh is bad.\n\nIn town areas, pre-gawai are held in May in advance of the gawai proper before the city dwellers return to their respective villages. \n\nGawai ends around the end of June. The closing ceremony is signified by symbolically rolling back a miring ceremony mat called a \"bidai\" by each family within the longhouse. It is known as \"Ngiling Bidai\" among Iban Dayaks.\n\nGawai Dayak celebrations may last for a month. It is during this time of year that many Dayak weddings (\"Melah Pinang\" or \"Gawai Lelabi\") take place. \n\nMost Iban will hold minor rites called \"bedara\" which can be \"bedara mata\" (an unripe offering) inside the family \"bilek\" room or \"bedara mansau\" (a ripe offering) at the family ruai gallery. \"Berunsur\" (cleansing) is performed at the family \"tanju\" (verandah). Rituals called \"gawa\" are the \"Sandau Ari\" (midday festival); \"Tresang Mansau\" (red bamboo pole); and \"Gawai Kalingkang\". \n\nRitual feasts of the Saribas and Skrang region include \"Gawai Bumai\" (agricultural festival); \"Gawai Batu\" (whetstone festival); \"Gawai Benih]]\" (a paddy seed festival); and \"Gawai Burong\" (a bird festival). The bird festival is performed early in the period to avoid spoiling of rice wine by the spirit \"Indai Bilai\" during the festival for the dead. The \"Gawai Antu\" or \"Ngelumbong\" (festival of the dead) follows the Gawai Dayak. \n\nIn the Baleh region, the Iban festivals include the \"Gawai Baintu-intu\" (wellness festival); \"Gawai Bumai\" (farming festival); \"Gawai Amat\" (proper festival to request divine supernatural assistance); \"Gawai Ngelumbung\" (tomb building festival) and \"Gawai Mimpi\" (dream festival based on dream messages from the spirits). \n\nFortune related festivals include \"Gawai Tuah\" (fortune festival); \"Gawai Ngiga Tuah\" (fortune seeking festival); \"Gawai Namaka Tuah\" (fortune welcoming festival); \"Gawai Tajau\" (jar festival); For any newly completed longhouses, a \"Gawai Mangkong Tiang\" (main house post hammering festival) is celebrated. The \"Gawai Sakit\" (healing festival) takes place if the \"belian\" rituals (\"sugi sakit\" and \"renong sakit\") are unsuccessful. \n\nFor most of these traditional festivals, sacred invocation and incantations called \"pengap\" or \"timang\" are performed through the night by a bard and his assistants. \n\nChristian Dayaks replace the traditional offering ceremony with a prayer session within the family room. The associated church service leadet is called \"tuai sembiang\".\n\n\n"}

The story of Sir Guy is considered by scholars to be part of the Matter of England.\n\nThe core of the legend is that Guy falls in love with the lady Felice (\"Happiness\"), who is of much higher social standing. In order to wed Felice he must prove his valour in chivalric adventures and become a knight; in order to do this he travels widely, battling fantastic monsters such as dragons, giants, a Dun Cow and great boars. He returns and weds Felice but soon, full of remorse for his violent past, he leaves on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land; later he returns privately and lives out his long life as a hermit (according to local legend in a cave overlooking the River Avon, situated at Guys Cliffe).\n\nIn one recension, Guy, son of Siward or Seguard of Wallingford, by his prowess in foreign wars wins in marriage Felice (the Phyllis of the well-known ballad), daughter and heiress of Roalt, Earl of Warwick. Soon after his marriage he is seized with remorse for the violence of his past life, and, by way of penance, leaves his wife and fortune to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. After years of absence he returns in time to deliver Winchester for Athelstan of England from the invading northern kings, Anelaph (Anlaf or Olaf) and Gonelaph, by slaying in single combat their champion, the giant Colbrand. Winchester tradition fixes the duel at Hyde Mead, before the Abbey near Winchester. Making his way to Warwick, he becomes one of his wife's beadsmen, and presently retires to a hermitage in Arden, only revealing his identity, like Saint Roch, at the approach of death.\n\nVelma Bourgeois Richmond has traced the career of Guy of Warwick from the legends of soldier saints to metrical romances composed for an aristocratic audience that widened in the sixteenth century to a popular audience that included Guy among the Nine Worthies, passing into children's literature and local guidebooks, before dying out in the twentieth century. The kernel of the tradition evidently lies in the fight with Colbrand, which symbolically represents some kernel of historical fact. The religious side of the legend finds parallels in the stories of St Eustachius and St Alexius, and makes it probable that the Guy-legend, as we have it, has passed through monastic hands. Tradition seems to be at fault in putting Guy's adventures anachronistically in the reign of Athelstan; the Anlaf of the story is probably Olaf Tryggvason, who, with Sweyn I of Denmark, harried the southern counties of England in 993 and pitched his winter quarters in Southampton; this means the King of England at the time was Æthelred \"Unready\" II. Winchester was saved, however, not by the valour of an English champion, but by the payment of money. This Olaf was not unnaturally confused with Anlaf Cuaran or Havelok the Dane.\n\nThe Anglo-Norman warrior hero of \"Gui de Warewic\", marked Guy's first appearance in the early thirteenth century. Topographical allusions show the poem's composer to be more familiar with the area of Wallingford, near Oxford, than with Warwickshire.\n\nGuy was transformed in the fourteenth century with a spate of metrical romances written in Middle English. The versions which we possess are adaptations from the French, and are cast in the form of a \"roman\"; the adventures open with a long recital of Guy's wars in Lombardy, Germany and Constantinople, embellished with fights with dragons and surprising feats of arms. The name \"Guy\" entered the Beauchamp family, earls of Warwick, when William de Beauchamp IV inherited the title in 1269 through his mother's brother, named his heir \"Guy\" in 1298. A tower added to Warwick Castle in 1394 was named \"Guy's Tower\", and Guy of Warwick relics began to accumulate.\n\n\"Filicia\", who belongs to the twelfth century, was perhaps the Norman poet's patroness, occurs in the pedigree of the Ardens, descended from Thurkill of Warwick and his son Siward. Guys Cliffe, near Warwick, where in the fourteenth century Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, erected a chantry, with a statue of the hero, does not correspond with the site of the hermitage as described in the \"Godfreyson\" (see Havelok).\n\nThe narrative detail of the legend is obvious fiction, though it may have become vaguely connected with the family history of the Ardens and the Wallingford family, but it was accepted as authentic fact in the chronicle of Pierre de Langtoft (Peter of Langtoft) written at the end of the thirteenth century.\n\nThe adventures of Reynbrun, son of Guy, and his tutor Heraud of Arden, who had also educated Guy, have much in common with his father's history, and form an interpolation sometimes treated as a separate romance. A connection between Guy and Guido, count of Tours (flourished about 800) was made when Alcuin's advice to the count, \"Liber ad Guidonem\", was transferred to the English hero in the \"Speculum Gy de Warewyke\" (c. 1327), edited for the Early English Text Society by Georgiana Lea Morrill Morrill, 1898.\n\nToday Guy of Warwick's Sword can be seen at Warwick Castle.\n\nThe Anglo-Norman French romance was edited by Alfred Ewert in 1932 and published by Champion, and is described by Emile Littré in \"Histoire littéraire de la France\" (xxii., 841-851, 1852). A French prose version was printed in Paris, 1525, and subsequently (see Gustave Brunet, \"Manuel du libraire\", \"s.v.\" \"Guy de Warvich\"); the English metrical romance exists in four versions dating from the early fourteenth century; the text was edited by J. Zupitza (187.51876) for the Early English Texts Society from Cambridge University Library, Paper MS. Ff. 2, 38, and again (pts. 1883-1891, extra series, Nos. 42, 49, 59), from the Auchinleck manuscript and Caius College MS. A late mediaeval Irish prose version, copied in the 15th century, \"The Irish Lives of Guy of Warwick and Bevis of Hampton\" is in Trinity College Library, Dublin (Ms H.2.7), and is largely based on the English originals (this, and its translation by F.N. Robinson, are available online from the CELT project).\n\nThe popularity of the legend is shown by the numerous versions in English: John Lydgate claimed that \"Guy of Warwick\", his English verse version composed between 1442 and 1468, was translated from the Latin chronicle of Giraldus Cornubiensis (fl. 1350); \"Guy of Warwick, a poem\" (written in 1617 and licensed, but not printed) by John Lane, the manuscript of which (in the British Library) contains a sonnet by John Milton, father of the poet; \"The Famous Historie of Guy, Earl of Warwick\" (c. 1607) by Samuel Rowlands; \"The Booke of the moste Victoryous Prince Guy of Warwicke\" (William Copland, London, n.d.); other editions by J. Cawood and C. Bates; chapbooks and ballads of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; \"The Tragical History, Admirable Achievements and Various Events of Guy Earl of Warwick\" (1661) which may possibly be identical with a play on the subject written by John Day and Thomas Dekker, and entered at Stationers' Hall on 15 January 1618/19; three verse fragments are printed by Hales and F. J. Furnivall in their edition of the Percy Folio MS. vol. ii.; an early French MS. is described by J. A. Herbert (\"An Early MS. of Gui de Warwick\", London, 1905). In the Valencian book \"Tirant lo Blanch\" appears a character based on Guy Whose name is \"Guillem de Varoic\"\n\n"}

He was also one of trustee of gita press by Ghanshyam Jalan and Jay Dayal ji Goeyendka-Sethji . His work in fostering pride among the people regarding India's glorious history and philosophic tradition earned him praise from Mahatma Gandhi. The Government of India issued a postage stamp in his memory in 1992.\n\nHanuman Prasad Poddar was born in Shillong. He spent a considerable time in Ratangarh in the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan into a Marwadi trading family belonging to the mercantile Agarwal caste. Born into a prosperous family of traditional outlook and culture, he received a rich traditional education and imbibed the culture, traditions and outlook of old India. His father was particularly keen that he should learn English, because the family had begun trading in Kolkata and knowledge of English was a necessary skill for making a success there.\n\nWhile he was still a teenager, Poddar was married to a girl from his own community and background, chosen by his parents. Around the same time, he began attending his father's office as an apprentice. He had the opportunity to travel over most of northern India by rail and bullock cart to advance his family's trading business. Once he had gained requisite experience and showed some ability, his father put him in charge of the Kolkata office, as had been the plan for him from an early age. Poddar, who was now in his 20s, made a success of this assignment and the family trading business flourished. Kolkata in those days was still the first city of the British Raj and the place where new ideas and awareness first made their appearance. At this time, four factors came together to produce a major impact on Poddar's mind and personality. These were: his exposure to wider India; exposure to cosmopolitan Kolkata, which in those days drew people from all over India; exposure to the British, whose authority and arrogance was nowhere as evident as in that metropolis; and perhaps most importantly, the pride and knowledge of Indian culture which had come to him from his traditional background. These four factors united to bring about within him an awareness of the pitiful state of India, and the need to instill pride in Indians of their culture and value system, so that they could deal with the world on their own terms.\n\nDuring these years, his wife remained with his parents in Ratangarh, while Poddar lived in Kolkata in a community hostel with other young Marwadi men who were also working in trade. This arrangement was standard and typical of the Kolkata Marwadi ethos of that day. It was in this milieu that Poddar came into contact with some Bengali young men of a revolutionary bent. In those days, Bengal was the cradle of armed struggle against British rule, and Kolkata was still the first city of India. the hostel in which Poddar lived began to be used as a safe house by certain revolutionary youth. Poddar had little knowledge and no involvement in these activities. Nevertheless, when the police finally raided the hostel, he and every other young man living there was tarred with the same brush as the revolutionaries. Although he was not accused in court of having committed any violent act, the British authorities jailed him for several months, pending trial, merely for having been in contact with the nationalist revolutionaries. This term in jail, for no actual offence, proved to be a turning point in Poddar's life. Although his family's business was flourishing, Poddar lost interest in pursuing trade. Instead, his inclination turned towards nationalism.\n\nIn 1918 he shifted to Bombay now Mumbai and over the period of time developed very close relationship with Lokmanya Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi, Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya & other leaders involved in the freedom struggle. https://radhababaofgorakhpur.wordpress.com/bio/shri-bhaiji/\n\nAfter being released from the jail he started publishing and editing ‘Kalyaan’ to reach the spiritual glory and high value oriented heroic deeds of heroes of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata to the each Indian to feel them spiritually free and proud of their achievements in the past as a source of inspiration to fight for the freedom of India.\n\nHe dedicated his life to make available great epics like the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Puranas and the Upanishads translated in Hindi to the common people at affordable prices.\n\nHe started publishing and editing ‘Kalyaan’ monthly Magazine from 1927 in Hindi with a view to ‘the betterment of life and the well- being of all’ This Magazine is basically dedicated to spirituality and gives wider exposure to the various aspects of Hindu religion. ‘Kalyan’ has published special issues on all Puranas, Upanishads and on many more subjects related to Hindu culture and religion. This magazine still continues to be in publication with approximately 2,50,000 subscribers.\n\nHe also published and edited ‘Kalyaan – Kalpataru’ in English from 1934 and the book continues to be in publication\n\nLovingly called as Bhaijee, he was a multifaceted personality. As an editor of the religious magazine 'Kalyan', he is known for his untiring efforts to propagate and disseminate Hindu religion across the world.\n\nHe wrote many books on spiritual and value–oriented subjects in Hindi and English. His translation of some Upanishads and Puranas in Hindi and English show his command over both languages. In these translations, he has taken care of the communicability of the language to the common people without causing any compromise with their poetic and philosophical heights and depths.\n\n\nJai radhe baba ji\njai bhai ji ki"}

She made a notable appearance in \"Incredible Hulk: Hercules Unleashed\" (October 1996). She then appeared in \"Hulk vs. Hercules: When Titans Collide\" #1 (June 2008), and became a recurring character in the second year of \"The Incredible Hercules\" beginning in issue #127.\n\nThe third child of Zeus and Hera (her brothers are Ares and Hephaestus), she is the Goddess of Youth and the cup-bearer of the gods, responsible for brewing ambrosia. She was married to the newly-divine Hercules as a peace offering between Hercules and her mother Hera, and for a time the two of them had a happy relationship. However, Hercules grew dissatisfied with life on Olympus, and returned to the mortal world in search of adventure. He also began having affairs, which left Hebe distraught as Hera told her that the failure of her marriage was her fault.\n\nFollowing the destruction of Olympus at the hands of Amatsu-Mikaboshi, Hebe serves her mother Hera as a secretary at the Olympus Group. She later arranges for Norman Osborn and his Dark Avengers to arrive on the site of a battle between Hera and Hercules' group, believing that her ultimate duty was still to him.

Women in Bengal typically use old saris and cloth and layer them with kantha stitching to make a light blanket, throw, or bedspread, especially for children. Kantha is very popular with tourists visiting the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nKantha is a form of embroidery often practised by rural women. The traditional form of Kantha embroidery was done with soft dhotis and saris, with a simple running stitch along the edges. Depending on the use of the finished product they were known as \"Lepkantha\" or \"Sujni Kantha\".\n\nThe embroidered cloth has many uses including shawls, covers for mirrors, boxes, and pillows. In some cases, the entire cloth is covered with running stitches, employing beautiful motifs of flowers, animals birds and geometrical shapes, as well as themes from everyday activities. The stitching on the cloth gives it a slightly wrinkled, wavy effect. Contemporary Kantha is applied to a wider range of garments such as sarees, dupatta, shirts for men and women, bedding and other furnishing fabrics, mostly using cotton and silk. Modern Kantha-stitch craft industry involves a very complex multi-staged production model.\n\nKantha also means \"throat\". Kantha is also used to describe a style of necklace that lies close to the throat, open at the back.\n\n\n\n"}

This association has spawned several well-known customs and practices on Lag BaOmer, including the lighting of bonfires, pilgrimages to the tomb of Bar Yochai in the northern Israeli town of Meron, and various customs at the tomb itself.\n\nLag BaOmer is Hebrew for \"33rd [day] in the Omer\". (The Hebrew letter ל (lamed) or \"L\" has the numerical value of 30 and ג (gimmel) or \"G\" has the numerical value of 3. A vowel sound is conventionally added for pronunciation purposes.)\n\nSome Jews call this holiday Lag LaOmer, which means \"33rd [day] \"of\" the Omer\", as opposed to Lag BaOmer, \"33rd [day] \"in\" the Omer\". Lag BaOmer is the traditional method of counting by some Ashkenazi and Hasidic Jews; Lag LaOmer is the count used by Sephardi Jews. Lag LaOmer is also the name used by Yosef Karo, who was a Sepharadi, in his \"Shulchan Aruch\" (\"Orach Chaim\" 493:2, and cf. 489:1 where BaOmer is inserted by a glossator). (The form Lag B'Omer [\"33rd day of \"an\" Omer\"] is also sometimes used, though it is not grammatically correct in this setting.) The Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, writes in his \"Likkutei Sichos\" that a deeper reason for the term Lag BaOmer is that the Hebrew words \"Lag BaOmer\" (ל״ג בעמר, spelled without the \"vav\"), have the same \"gematria\" as \"Moshe\" (משה, Moses). He writes that Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, whose yahrzeit is traditionally observed on this day, was mystically a spark of the soul of Moses.\n\nThe origins of Lag BaOmer as a minor festival are unclear. The date is mentioned explicitly for the first time in the 12th century by Avraham ben Nathan in the Sefer Hamanhig (106). The Talmudist Meiri in his gloss to \"Yevamot\" 62b cites the Talmudic passage which states that during the time of Rabbi Akiva, 24,000 of his students died from a divinely-sent plague during the counting of the Omer. The Talmud goes on to say that this was because they did not show proper respect to one another. Meiri named Lag BaOmer as the day when, \"according to a tradition of the geonim\", the \"plague\" ended.\n\nAfter the death of Rabbi Akiva's 24,000 students, he was left with only five students, among them Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The latter went on to become the greatest teacher of Torah in his generation, and is purported to have authored the \"Zohar\", a landmark text of Jewish mysticism. The \"Zohar\" calls the day of Bar Yochai's death a \"hillula\". Rabbi Chaim Vital, the main disciple of Rabbi Isaac Luria and author of \"\", was the first to name Lag BaOmer as the date of Bar Yochai's \"hillula\". According to the \"Zohar\" (III, 287b–296b), on the day of Bar Yochai's death, he revealed the deepest secrets of the Kabbalah. Lag BaOmer therefore became a day of celebration of the great light (i.e., wisdom) that Bar Yochai brought into the world.\n\nNachman Krochmal, a 19th-century Jewish theologian, among others, suggests that the deaths of Rabbi Akiva's students was a veiled reference to the defeat of \"Akiva's soldiers\" by the Romans, and that Lag BaOmer was the day on which Bar Kokhba enjoyed a brief victory.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Lag BaOmer became a special holiday for rabbinical students and was called \"Scholar's Day.\" It was customary to rejoice on this day through outdoor sports.\n\nLag BaOmer has another significance based on the Kabbalistic custom of assigning a Sefirah to each day and week of the Omer count. The first week corresponds to \"Chesed\", the second week to \"Gevurah\", etc., and similarly, the first day of each week corresponds to \"Chesed\", the second day to \"Gevurah\", etc. Thus, the 33rd day, which is the fifth day of the fifth week, corresponds to \"Hod she-be-Hod\" (Splendor within [the week of] Splendor). As such, Lag BaOmer represents the level of spiritual manifestation or Hod that would precede the more physical manifestation of the 49th day (\"Malkhut she-be-Malkhut\", Kingship within [the week of] Kingship), which immediately precedes the holiday of Shavuot.\n\nWhile the Counting of the Omer is a semi-mourning period, all restrictions of mourning are lifted on this 33rd day of the Omer. As a result, weddings, parties, listening to music, and haircuts are commonly scheduled to coincide with this day among Ashkenazi Jews. Families go on picnics and outings. Children go out to the fields with their teachers with bows and rubber-tipped arrows. , the prayer for special Divine mercy on one's behalf is not said, because when God is showing one a \"smiling face,\" so to speak, as He does especially on the holidays, there is no need to ask for special mercy.\n\nThe Sephardi custom is to continue mourning practices through the 33rd day of the Omer and celebrate on the 34th day of the Omer, or \"\" ().\n\nThe most well-known custom of is the lighting of bonfires throughout Israel and worldwide wherever religious Jews can be found. In Meron, the burial place of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son, Rabbi Eleazar, hundreds of thousands of Jews gather throughout the night and day to celebrate with bonfires, torches, song and feasting. This was a specific request by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai of his students. Some say that as bar Yochai gave spiritual light to the world with the revelation of the Zohar, bonfires are lit to symbolize the impact of his teachings. As his passing left such a \"light\" behind, many candles and/or bonfires are lit.\n\nThe \"\" cites another reason for the lighting of bonfires. On the day of his death, Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai said, \"Now it is my desire to reveal secrets... The day will not go to its place like any other, for this entire day stands within my domain...\" Daylight was miraculously extended until Rabbi Shimon had completed his final teaching and died. This symbolized that all light is subservient to spiritual light, and particularly to the primeval light contained within the mystical teachings of the Torah. As such, the custom of lighting fires symbolizes this revelation of powerful light.\n\nAt the tomb of Rabbi Shimon, the honor of lighting the main bonfire traditionally goes to the Rebbes of the Boyaner dynasty. This privilege was purchased by Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman, the first Sadigura Rebbe, from the Sephardi guardians of Meron and Safed. The Sadigura Rebbe bequeathed this honor to his eldest son, Rabbi Yitzchok Friedman, the first Boyaner Rebbe, and his progeny. The first \"\" (lighting) is attended by hundreds of thousands of people annually; in 2001, the crowd was estimated at 300,000.\n\nIn 1983 Rabbi Levi Yitzchak Horowitz, the second Bostoner Rebbe, reinstated a century-old tradition among Bostoner Hasidim to light a bonfire near the grave of Rabbi Akiva in Tiberias on night. The tradition had been abandoned due to murderous attacks on participants in the isolated location. After the bonfire, the Rebbe delivered a , gave blessings, and distributed . Later that same night, the Rebbe cut the hair of three-year-old boys for their Upsherin.\n\nIn Britain bonfires are lit; the London Fire Brigade reported in 2018 that it had responded to several bonfires throughout the night, one of which caused an explosion that injured several people.\n\nFor many years, Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum of the Satmar group, who was based in the US, said to his students that it was not customary outside of Israel to make bonfires, and he discouraged the students in his yeshiva from lighting bonfires on . However, in 2000 his father, Rabbi Moses Teitelbaum, the then-Grand Rabbi of Satmar, instructed his son to make a large bonfire in the Satmar enclave of Kiryas Joel, New York, US on the night of . In 2012 the Lag BaOmer bonfire in Kiryas Joel drew an estimated 50,000 participants.\n\nFor Zionists (see section below), the bonfires are said to represent the signal fires that the Bar Kokhba rebels lit on the mountaintops to relay messages, or are in remembrance of the Bar Kochba revolt against the Romans, who had forbidden the kindling of fires that signalled the start of Jewish holidays.\n\nAnother custom at the tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai is the giving of ' (). The Hebrew word \"chai\" has the (numerical equivalent) of 18. ' is a liquid measure of about 3 liters. Thus, 18 rotels equals 54 liters or about 13 gallons. It is popularly believed that if one donates or offers 18 rotels of liquid refreshment (grape juice, wine, soda or even water) to those attending the celebrations at bar Yochai's tomb on , then the giver will be granted miraculous salvation.\n\nAccording to ', many childless couples found success with this ' (propitious practice). This practice was also endorsed by Rabbi Ovadia miBartenura and The Shelah HaKadosh. The Bobover Rebbe, Rabbi Ben Zion Halberstam, sent a letter from Poland to his Hasidim in Israel asking them to donate ' in Meron on this holy day on behalf of a couple that did not have children. Several local organizations solicit donations of ' and hand out the drinks on the donor's behalf in Meron on . Nine months after , the Ohel Rashbi organization even invites couples who prayed at the tomb and had a child to come back to Meron to celebrate the births.\n\nIt is customary at the Meron celebrations, dating from the time of Rabbi Isaac Luria, that three-year-old boys be given their first haircuts ('), while their parents distribute wine and sweets. Similar ' celebrations are simultaneously held in Jerusalem at the grave of Shimon Hatzaddik for Jerusalemites who cannot travel to Meron.\n\nHistorically, children across Israel used to go out and play with bows and arrows, reflecting the Midrashic statement that the rainbow (the sign of God's promise to never again destroy the earth with a flood; Genesis 9:11–13) was not seen during Bar Yochai's lifetime, as his merit protected the world.\n\nIn Israel, is a holiday for children and the various youth movements. It is also marked in the Israel Defense Forces as a week of the program (youth brigades) which were established on in 1941 and which bear the emblem of a bow and arrow.\n\n is a popular day for weddings among Ashkenazi Jews (Sephardi Jews hold weddings on , the 34th day of the Omer). For those who do not conduct celebrations between and , the date often marks the first opportunity for a wedding in the spring or early summer.\n\nThe Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, encouraged parades to be held in Jewish communities around the world as a demonstration of Jewish unity and pride. Chabad sponsors parades as well as rallies, bonfires and barbecues for thousands of participants around the world each year.\n\nSeveral traditional songs are associated with the holiday; these are sung around bonfires, at weddings, and at ' held by Hasidic Rebbes on . The popular song \"'\" was composed by Rabbi Shimon Labi (–), a 16th-century kabbalist, in honor of Shimon Bar Yochai. Other songs include \"'\", a poem arranged as an alphabetical acrostic, and \"'\".\n\nMost Hasidic Rebbes conduct a ' on Lag BaOmer, in addition to or instead of a bonfire. A full meal is usually served, and candles are lit. It is traditional to sing \"'\", \"'\", and \"'\". In Satmar, \"'\" is sung at the ' in addition to the other songs. Teachings of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, both from the Talmud and the Zohar, are generally expounded upon by Rebbes at their '. In some Hasidic courts, the Rebbe may shoot a toy bow and arrow during the ', and three-year-old boys may be brought to have a lock of hair cut by the Rebbe as part of their first haircut.\n\nIn modern Israel, early Zionists redefined Lag BaOmer from a rabbinic-oriented celebration to a commemoration of the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire (132–136 CE). According to work published by Yael Zerubavel of Rutgers University, a number of Lag BaOmer traditions were reinterpreted by Zionist ideologues to focus on the victory of the Bar Kokhba rebels rather than their ultimate defeat at Betar three years later. The plague that decimated Rabbi Akiva's 24,000 disciples was explained as a veiled reference to the revolt; the 33rd day when the plague ended was explained as the day of Bar Kokhba's victory. By the late 1940s, Israeli textbooks for schoolchildren painted Bar Kokhba as the hero while Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and Rabbi Akiva stood on the sidelines, cheering him on. This interpretation lent itself to singing and dancing around bonfires by night to celebrate Bar Kokhba's victory, and playing with bows and arrows by day to remember the actions of Bar Kokhba's rebel forces.\n\nThis interpretation of the holiday reinforced the Zionist reading of Jewish history and underscored their efforts to establish an independent Jewish state. As Benjamin Lau writes in \"Haaretz\":\nThis is how Lag Ba'omer became a part of the Israeli-Zionist psyche during the first years of Zionism and Israel. A clear distinction became evident between Jews and Israelis \"(sic)\" in the way the day was celebrated: The religious Jews lit torches in Rashbi's [Shimon bar Yochai's] honor and sang songs about him, while young Israelis, sitting around an alternative bonfire, sang about a hero \"whom the entire nation loved\" and focused on the image of a powerful hero who galloped on a lion in his charges against the Romans.\n\nIn modern Israel, Lag BaOmer is \"a symbol for the fighting Jewish spirit\". The Palmach division of the Haganah was established on Lag BaOmer 1941, and the government order creating the Israel Defense Forces was issued on Lag BaOmer 1948. Beginning in 2004, the Israeli government designated Lag BaOmer as the day for saluting the IDF reserves.\n\n\n"}

As theories among pedagogues as to what constitutes proficiency go, there is little consistency as to how different organizations classify it. Additionally, fluency and language competence are generally recognized as being related, but separate controversial subjects. In predominant frameworks in the United States, proficient speakers demonstrate both accuracy and fluency, and use a variety of discourse strategies. Thus, native speakers of a language can be fluent without being considered proficient. Native-level fluency is estimated to be between 20,000 and 40,000 words, but basic conversational fluency might require only as little as 3,000 words.\n\nThe American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) distinguishes between proficiency and performance. In part, ACTFL's definition of proficiency is derived from mandates issued by the U.S. government, declaring that a limited English proficient student is one who comes from a non-English background and \"who has sufficient difficulty speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language and whose difficulties may deny such an individual the opportunity to learn successfully in classrooms where the language of instruction is English or to participate fully in our society\".\n\nACTFL views \"performance\" as being the combined effect of all three modes of communication: interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational.\n\nNote that test scores may not correlate reliably, as different understandings of proficiency lead to different types of assessment:\n\nSee also: \n\n\n"}

The in-game graphics consist entirely of digitized photographs. This caused controversy as it allowed players to shoot photorealistic representations of enemies.\n\nHome versions were released for the Super NES, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and Sega CD during the following year and include a revolver-shaped light gun known as the Konami Justifier.\n\n\"Lethal Enforcers\" was followed by \"\". Both games would later be released in the two-in-one compilation \"Lethal Enforcers I & II\" (\"Lethal Enforcers Deluxe Pack\" in Japan) for the PlayStation.\n\nYears later, Konami released the \"Police 911\" series as a Japan-themed sequel to the original plot. This was also followed by the arcade game \"Seigi No Hero\", which was localized and renamed as \"Lethal Enforcers 3\" for Western audiences.\n\nSet in Chicago, Illinois, United States, the player takes control of a police officer named Don Marshall, who has one day decided to go to the donut shop for a break. While sipping the last drop of coffee, he gets a call from the police department. They said that a major crime organization has invaded town, and they need his help. He is one of the two survivors of the elite group of officers. The rest have ended up in the hospital or killed. Once the call ended, he decided to check out the bank. From that point on, he is going to experience the toughest job that he would have during his years in the police force. He has been assigned and agrees to help stop a growing crime wave that puts the city's security in serious jeopardy, along with a helper (a second player can join in).\n\nInitially armed with a standard-issue service revolver, the player can acquire upgraded weapons during the course of play: a .357 Magnum, a semi-automatic pistol, a combat shotgun, an assault rifle, a submachine gun, or a grenade launcher. The submachine gun and grenade launcher can only be used once while other weapons can be reloaded like the basic service revolver. When the player loses a life, his/her weapon reverts to the basic service revolver. When the player loses all lives, the game will be over unless he/she chooses to continue.\n\n\"Lethal Enforcers\" has six stages (including the Training Stage): \"The Bank Robbery\", \"Chinatown Assault\", \"Hijacking\", \"The Drug Dealers\", and \"Chemical Plant Sabotage\". During each stage, the player must shoot the armed robbers without harming any innocent civilians or fellow policemen. One shot is enough to kill most enemies. At the end of each stage, a boss must be killed in order to complete the stage. A dip switch setting in the arcade version allows operators to let players progress through the stages in a linear fashion (\"arcade mode\") or select individual stages (\"street mode\").\n\nEnemies always wear sunglasses, ski masks or gas masks, while fellow police officers and innocent bystanders are always barefaced. The boss character, however, sometimes will have his face exposed; however, this battle is fought where there are no innocents present.\n\nThere are different ranks that the player can attain based on performance. The ranks are: Patrolman, Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, and Commander. When the game begins, the player's rank is Patrolman, and after each stage the player is promoted, provided they have not killed any innocents.\n\nIf any innocents are killed, the player either maintains his or her rank or gets demoted, although the ranks do not go below Patrolman.\n\nHome versions were released for the Super NES, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and Sega CD. The home versions make use of a revolver-shaped light gun known as the Konami Justifier, which came packaged with the game. A standard controller can be also used in lieu of the light gun in these versions. A second-player Justifier light gun, pink in color, was available only by mail order from Konami. The CD version features higher quality CD-DA music, sampled from the arcade original. The game is also featured alongside \"\" in the two-in-one compilation titled: \"Lethal Enforcers I & II\" (\"Lethal Enforcers Deluxe Pack\" in Japan), developed by Konami Chicago and released for the PlayStation in 1997. A Sega Saturn version of the compilation was also announced but cancelled.\n\nThe Super NES version features traditional Nintendo censorship; no blood is shown when a player or criminal dies. Instead, the screen will flash light green or light blue to indicate that a player lost a life. Also, \"Chinatown Assault\" is renamed \"Downtown Assault.\"\n\nThe Japanese arcade version of Lethal Enforcers contain several differences from the US and European arcade versions. These differences include the \"how to reload\" animation (the US and European versions show a woman shooting outside of the cabinet's screen to reload in-game, while the Japanese version shows the default revolver and how to reload it), and an additional enemy taunt, \"Die, pigs!\", which was removed from the US and European versions.\n\n\"GamePro\" gave rave reviews for the Sega CD, Genesis and SNES versions; for the SNES version, they cited the accuracy of the Konami Justifier, the realistic graphics, and the \"appropriately hyper music\". \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" scored the SNES version 24 out of 40 (6 out of 10 average). Though they noted that the port was technically impressive, they felt the brutal violence was toned down to the point where the spirit of the game was lost.\n\nThe \"Lethal Enforcers I & II\" compilation received mediocre reviews, with critics saying that while the conversion is arcade perfect, the gameplay is simplistic and the graphics are highly static compared to contemporaries like \"Time Crisis\". Dan Hsu of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", which gave the compilation a 4.875 out of 10, commented that while the \"Lethal Enforcers\" games were very good, they were both too aged to stand up against other 1997 releases and not classic enough to make a credible retro compilation.\n\n\"Mega\" placed the game at number 35 in their Top 50 Mega Drive Games of All Time and number 6 in their Top 10 Mega CD Games of All Time.\n\n\"Lethal Enforcers\" was one of the video games involved in the video game violence controversy of the early 1990s and at the time it was not sold in toy stores. Along with \"Night Trap\", the Genesis version was one of the first video games to be rated MA-17 by Sega's Videogame Rating Council.\n\nA level in Konami's shooter \"Jikkyō Oshaberi Parodius\" is modeled after \"Lethal Enforcers\" and has the player character avoiding moving crosshairs.

Principal photography began on June 19, 2017, in Atlanta, Georgia and wrapped on September 27, 2017. The film is scheduled to be released on May 31, 2019, in 2D, 3D, and select IMAX by Warner Bros. Pictures, except in Japan where it will be distributed by Toho.\n\nIn an age when monsters reclaim the planet, humanity's fight for survival triggers the inevitable battle between Godzilla and King Kong, while Monarch unravels the origins of the Titans and a human conspiracy that threatens to destroy all the monsters. \n\nThe project was announced in October 2015 when Legendary announced plans for a shared cinematic universe between Godzilla and King Kong. The film's writers room was assembled in March 2017 and Adam Wingard was announced as the director in May 2017. Principal photography began in November 2018 in Hawaii and Australia and is expected to conclude in February 2019. \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" is scheduled to be released on May 22, 2020 in 2D, 3D, and IMAX by Warner Bros. Pictures, except in Japan where it will be distributed by Toho.\n\n\nLegendary's Godzilla was featured as a playable character in Bandai Namco's 2014 video game \"Godzilla\" as \"Hollywood Godzilla\".\n\n"}

Plants communicate through a host of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be separated into four broad categories, each the product of distinct chemical pathways: fatty acid derivatives, phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, amino acid derivatives, and terpenoids. Due to the physical/chemical constraints most VOCs are of low molecular mass (< 300 Da), are hydrophobic, and have high vapor pressures. The responses of organisms to plant emitted VOCs varies from attracting the predator of a specific herbivore to reduce mechanical damage inflicted on the plant to the induction of chemical defenses of a neighboring plant before it is being attacked. In addition, the host of VOCs emitted varies from plant to plant, where for example, the Venus Fly Trap can emit VOCs to specifically target and attract starved prey. While these VOCs typically lead to an increase in herbivory resistance in neighboring plants, there is no clear benefit to the emitting plant in helping nearby plants. As such, whether neighboring plants have evolved the capability to \"eavesdrop\" or whether there is an unknown tradeoff occurring is subject to much scientific debate.\n\nTerpenoids facilitate communication between plants and insects, mammals, fungi, microorganisms, and other plants. Terpenoids may act as both attractants and repllants for various insects. For example, pine shoot beetles (\"Tomicus piniperda\") are attracted to certain monoterpenes ( (+/-)-a-pinene, (+)-3-carene and terpinolene) produced by Scots pines \"(Pinus sylvestris\"), while being repelled by others (such as verbenone).\n\nTerpenoids are a large family of biological molecules with over 22,000 compounds. Terpenoids are similar to terpenes in their carbon skeleton but unlike terpenes contain functional groups. The structure of terpenoids is described by the biogenetic isoprene rule which states that terpenoids can be thought of being made of isoprenoid subunits, arranged either regularly or irregularly. The biosynthesis of terpenoids occurs via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) and mevalonic acid(MVA) pathways both of which include isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) as key compenents. The MEP pathway produces hemiterpenes, monoterpenes, diterpenes, and volatile carotenoid derivatives while the MVA pathway produces sesquiterpenes.\n"}

These conditions could include, but are not limited to, highway projects, major construction, the flood plain of a proposed dam, or even before the onset of war. Unlike traditional survey and excavation, rescue archaeology must be undertaken at speed. Rescue archaeology is included in the broader categories that are cultural resource management (CRM) and cultural heritage management (CHM).\n\nRescue archaeology occurs on sites about to be destroyed but, on occasion, may include in situ preservation of any finds or protective measures taken to preserve an unexcavated site beneath a building. Urban areas with many overlaid years of habitation are often candidates for rescue archaeology.\nThe focus of early work was to set up organisations to undertake rescue excavations shortly before an area was disturbed by construction equipment. Archaeologists relied on the goodwill of the developer to provide the opportunity to record remains. In more recent use, an archaeological survey may be required by planning process or building law, as with PPG 16 or PPS5 in the United Kingdom and NPPG5 in Scotland. Common conditions required by planning authorities are archaeological field survey, watching briefs, shovel test pits, trial trenching, and excavation. Guidance and standards of practice in the UK are largely monitored through the Institute for Archaeologists.\n\nContract or commercial archaeology services have sprung up to meet the needs of developers and to comply with local laws and planning regulations. In the United Kingdom, over 3000 archaeologists are employed in commercial archaeology. \n\nFor many years, the emphasis was on archaeological evidence in the ground. However, with increased interest in industrial archaeology, rescue archaeology needs to commence by recording extant remains of buildings i.e. prior to demolition.\n\nThe term, and indeed the practice of, rescue archaeology is largely restricted to North America, South America, Western Europe, and East Asia, especially the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Korea, and Japan. Many European countries, such as, e.g., Germany, practice virtually no rescue excavation (though there is extensive research archaeology). The many rescue archaeology projects in the Middle East are generally termed salvage archaeology.\n\nIn North America, commercial archeology sometimes refers to the study of structures and artifacts created in connection with popular commercial activity, such as diners, motels, gasoline stations, and signs. Special focus is given to commerce and transportation, the effects of market economy and the use of space, and the development of roadside businesses.\n\nWhereas the organizations that take on rescue archaeology contracts are stable entities, the archaeologists who perform the actual field work are, in the main, an army of mobile workers. They work in all types of weather and terrain covering tasks such as conservation, excavation, artifact curation, field survey often in difficult conditions (such as dense woodland), and typically working to tight deadlines. Given that the outputs of much of the work that is undertaken in advance of development work is not published in peer reviewed journals, the people that perform the actual research are often anonymous and unrecognized.\n\n\"Shovelbum\" is a play on one of the more polite names which professional archaeologists call each other when they enter the field of rescue archaeology and move from excavation to excavation. As much archaeology is now developer-led, the fieldworkers must move to where the work is when one contract is complete, much like ski-bums following the good snow fall. For professional field archaeologists the Shovelbum phase of a career is now considered a rite of passage. It is during this time that any field archaeologist worth their salt learns the ropes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34327569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34327569", "title": "Social network", "text": "Social network\n\nA social network is a social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of dyadic ties, and other social interactions between actors. The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures. The study of these structures uses social network analysis to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics.\n\nSocial networks and the analysis of them is an inherently interdisciplinary academic field which emerged from social psychology, sociology, statistics, and graph theory. Georg Simmel authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and \"web of group affiliations\". Jacob Moreno is credited with developing the first sociograms in the 1930s to study interpersonal relationships. These approaches were mathematically formalized in the 1950s and theories and methods of social networks became pervasive in the social and behavioral sciences by the 1980s. Social network analysis is now one of the major paradigms in contemporary sociology, and is also employed in a number of other social and formal sciences. Together with other complex networks, it forms part of the nascent field of network science.\n\nThe social network is a theoretical construct useful in the social sciences to study relationships between individuals, groups, organizations, or even entire societies (social units, see differentiation). The term is used to describe a social structure determined by such interactions. The ties through which any given social unit connects represent the convergence of the various social contacts of that unit. This theoretical approach is, necessarily, relational. An axiom of the social network approach to understanding social interaction is that social phenomena should be primarily conceived and investigated through the properties of relations between and within units, instead of the properties of these units themselves. Thus, one common criticism of social network theory is that individual agency is often ignored although this may not be the case in practice (see agent-based modeling). Precisely because many different types of relations, singular or in combination, form these network configurations, network analytics are useful to a broad range of research enterprises. In social science, these fields of study include, but are not limited to anthropology, biology, communication studies, economics, geography, information science, organizational studies, social psychology, sociology, and sociolinguistics.\n\nIn the late 1890s, both Émile Durkheim and Ferdinand Tönnies foreshadowed the idea of social networks in their theories and research of social groups. Tönnies argued that social groups can exist as personal and direct social ties that either link individuals who share values and belief (\"Gemeinschaft\", German, commonly translated as \"community\") or impersonal, formal, and instrumental social links (\"Gesellschaft\", German, commonly translated as \"society\"). Durkheim gave a non-individualistic explanation of social facts, arguing that social phenomena arise when interacting individuals constitute a reality that can no longer be accounted for in terms of the properties of individual actors. Georg Simmel, writing at the turn of the twentieth century, pointed to the nature of networks and the effect of network size on interaction and examined the likelihood of interaction in loosely knit networks rather than groups.\nMajor developments in the field can be seen in the 1930s by several groups in psychology, anthropology, and mathematics working independently. In psychology, in the 1930s, Jacob L. Moreno began systematic recording and analysis of social interaction in small groups, especially classrooms and work groups (see sociometry). In anthropology, the foundation for social network theory is the theoretical and ethnographic work of Bronislaw Malinowski, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, and Claude Lévi-Strauss. A group of social anthropologists associated with Max Gluckman and the Manchester School, including John A. Barnes, J. Clyde Mitchell and Elizabeth Bott Spillius, often are credited with performing some of the first fieldwork from which network analyses were performed, investigating community networks in southern Africa, India and the United Kingdom. Concomitantly, British anthropologist S. F. Nadel codified a theory of social structure that was influential in later network analysis. In sociology, the early (1930s) work of Talcott Parsons set the stage for taking a relational approach to understanding social structure. Later, drawing upon Parsons' theory, the work of sociologist Peter Blau provides a strong impetus for analyzing the relational ties of social units with his work on social exchange theory.\n\nBy the 1970s, a growing number of scholars worked to combine the different tracks and traditions. One group consisted of sociologist Harrison White and his students at the Harvard University Department of Social Relations. Also independently active in the Harvard Social Relations department at the time were Charles Tilly, who focused on networks in political and community sociology and social movements, and Stanley Milgram, who developed the \"six degrees of separation\" thesis. Mark Granovetter and Barry Wellman are among the former students of White who elaborated and championed the analysis of social networks.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, social network analysis experienced work by sociologists, political scientists, and physicists such as Duncan J. Watts, Albert-László Barabási, Peter Bearman, Nicholas A. Christakis, James H. Fowler, and others, developing and applying new models and methods to emerging data available about online social networks, as well as \"digital traces\" regarding face-to-face networks.\n\nIn general, social networks are self-organizing, emergent, and complex, such that a globally coherent pattern appears from the local interaction of the elements that make up the system. These patterns become more apparent as network size increases. However, a global network analysis of, for example, all interpersonal relationships in the world is not feasible and is likely to contain so much information as to be uninformative. Practical limitations of computing power, ethics and participant recruitment and payment also limit the scope of a social network analysis. The nuances of a local system may be lost in a large network analysis, hence the quality of information may be more important than its scale for understanding network properties. Thus, social networks are analyzed at the scale relevant to the researcher's theoretical question. Although levels of analysis are not necessarily mutually exclusive, there are three general levels into which networks may fall: micro-level, meso-level, and macro-level.\n\nAt the micro-level, social network research typically begins with an individual, snowballing as social relationships are traced, or may begin with a small group of individuals in a particular social context.\n\nDyadic level: A dyad is a social relationship between two individuals. Network research on dyads may concentrate on structure of the relationship (e.g. multiplexity, strength), social equality, and tendencies toward reciprocity/mutuality.\n\nTriadic level: Add one individual to a dyad, and you have a triad. Research at this level may concentrate on factors such as balance and transitivity, as well as social equality and tendencies toward reciprocity/mutuality. In the balance theory of Fritz Heider the triad is the key to social dynamics. The discord in a rivalrous love triangle is an example of an unbalanced triad, likely to change to a balanced triad by a change in one of the relations. The dynamics of social friendships in society has been modeled by balancing triads. The study is carried forward with the theory of signed graphs.\n\nActor level: The smallest unit of analysis in a social network is an individual in their social setting, i.e., an \"actor\" or \"ego\". Egonetwork analysis focuses on network characteristics such as size, relationship strength, density, centrality, prestige and roles such as isolates, liaisons, and bridges. Such analyses, are most commonly used in the fields of psychology or social psychology, ethnographic kinship analysis or other genealogical studies of relationships between individuals.\n\nSubset level: Subset levels of network research problems begin at the micro-level, but may cross over into the meso-level of analysis. Subset level research may focus on distance and reachability, cliques, cohesive subgroups, or other group actions or behavior.\n\nIn general, meso-level theories begin with a population size that falls between the micro- and macro-levels. However, meso-level may also refer to analyses that are specifically designed to reveal connections between micro- and macro-levels. Meso-level networks are low density and may exhibit causal processes distinct from interpersonal micro-level networks.\n\nOrganizations: Formal organizations are social groups that distribute tasks for a collective goal. Network research on organizations may focus on either intra-organizational or inter-organizational ties in terms of formal or informal relationships. Intra-organizational networks themselves often contain multiple levels of analysis, especially in larger organizations with multiple branches, franchises or semi-autonomous departments. In these cases, research is often conducted at a workgroup level and organization level, focusing on the interplay between the two structures. Experiments with networked groups online have documented ways to optimize group-level coordination through diverse interventions, including the addition of autonomous agents to the groups.\n\nRandomly distributed networks: Exponential random graph models of social networks became state-of-the-art methods of social network analysis in the 1980s. This framework has the capacity to represent social-structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks, including general degree-based structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks as well as reciprocity and transitivity, and at the node-level, homophily and attribute-based activity and popularity effects, as derived from explicit hypotheses about dependencies among network ties. Parameters are given in terms of the prevalence of small subgraph configurations in the network and can be interpreted as describing the combinations of local social processes from which a given network emerges. These probability models for networks on a given set of actors allow generalization beyond the restrictive dyadic independence assumption of micro-networks, allowing models to be built from theoretical structural foundations of social behavior.\n\nScale-free networks: A scale-free network is a network whose degree distribution follows a power law, at least asymptotically. In network theory a scale-free ideal network is a random network with a degree distribution that unravels the size distribution of social groups. Specific characteristics of scale-free networks vary with the theories and analytical tools used to create them, however, in general, scale-free networks have some common characteristics. One notable characteristic in a scale-free network is the relative commonness of vertices with a degree that greatly exceeds the average. The highest-degree nodes are often called \"hubs\", and may serve specific purposes in their networks, although this depends greatly on the social context. Another general characteristic of scale-free networks is the clustering coefficient distribution, which decreases as the node degree increases. This distribution also follows a power law. The Barabási model of network evolution shown above is an example of a scale-free network.\n\nRather than tracing interpersonal interactions, macro-level analyses generally trace the outcomes of interactions, such as economic or other resource transfer interactions over a large population.\n\nLarge-scale networks: Large-scale network is a term somewhat synonymous with \"macro-level\" as used, primarily, in social and behavioral sciences, in economics. Originally, the term was used extensively in the computer sciences (see large-scale network mapping).\n\nComplex networks: Most larger social networks display features of social complexity, which involves substantial non-trivial features of network topology, with patterns of complex connections between elements that are neither purely regular nor purely random (see, complexity science, dynamical system and chaos theory), as do biological, and technological networks. Such complex network features include a heavy tail in the degree distribution, a high clustering coefficient, assortativity or disassortativity among vertices, community structure (see stochastic block model), and hierarchical structure. In the case of agency-directed networks these features also include reciprocity, triad significance profile (TSP, see network motif), and other features. In contrast, many of the mathematical models of networks that have been studied in the past, such as lattices and random graphs, do not show these features.\n\nVarious theoretical frameworks have been imported for the use of social network analysis. The most prominent of these are Graph theory, Balance theory, Social comparison theory, and more recently, the Social identity approach.\n\nFew complete theories have been produced from social network analysis. Two that have are Structural Role Theory and Heterophily Theory.\n\nThe basis of Heterophily Theory was the finding in one study that more numerous weak ties can be important in seeking information and innovation, as cliques have a tendency to have more homogeneous opinions as well as share many common traits. This homophilic tendency was the reason for the members of the cliques to be attracted together in the first place. However, being similar, each member of the clique would also know more or less what the other members knew. To find new information or insights, members of the clique will have to look beyond the clique to its other friends and acquaintances. This is what Granovetter called \"the strength of weak ties\".\n\nIn the context of networks, social capital exists where people have an advantage because of their location in a network. Contacts in a network provide information, opportunities and perspectives that can be beneficial to the central player in the network. Most social structures tend to be characterized by dense clusters of strong connections. Information within these clusters tends to be rather homogeneous and redundant. Non-redundant information is most often obtained through contacts in different clusters. When two separate clusters possess non-redundant information, there is said to be a structural hole between them. Thus, a network that bridges structural holes will provide network benefits that are in some degree additive, rather than overlapping. An ideal network structure has a vine and cluster structure, providing access to many different clusters and structural holes.\n\nNetworks rich in structural holes are a form of social capital in that they offer information benefits. The main player in a network that bridges structural holes is able to access information from diverse sources and clusters. For example, in business networks, this is beneficial to an individual's career because he is more likely to hear of job openings and opportunities if his network spans a wide range of contacts in different industries/sectors. This concept is similar to Mark Granovetter's theory of weak ties, which rests on the basis that having a broad range of contacts is most effective for job attainment.\n\nCommunication Studies are often considered a part of both the social sciences and the humanities, drawing heavily on fields such as sociology, psychology, anthropology, information science, biology, political science, and economics as well as rhetoric, literary studies, and semiotics. Many communication concepts describe the transfer of information from one source to another, and can thus be conceived of in terms of a network.\n\nIn J.A. Barnes' day, a \"community\" referred to a specific geographic location and studies of community ties had to do with who talked, associated, traded, and attended church with whom. Today, however, there are extended \"online\" communities developed through telecommunications devices and social network services. Such devices and services require extensive and ongoing maintenance and analysis, often using network science methods. Community development studies, today, also make extensive use of such methods.\n\nComplex networks require methods specific to modelling and interpreting social complexity and complex adaptive systems, including techniques of dynamic network analysis.\nMechanisms such as Dual-phase evolution explain how temporal changes in connectivity contribute to the formation of structure in social networks.\n\nIn criminology and urban sociology, much attention has been paid to the social networks among criminal actors. For example, Andrew Papachristos has studied gang murders as a series of exchanges between gangs. Murders can be seen to diffuse outwards from a single source, because weaker gangs cannot afford to kill members of stronger gangs in retaliation, but must commit other violent acts to maintain their reputation for strength.\n\nDiffusion of ideas and innovations studies focus on the spread and use of ideas from one actor to another or one culture and another. This line of research seeks to explain why some become \"early adopters\" of ideas and innovations, and links social network structure with facilitating or impeding the spread of an innovation.\n\nIn demography, the study of social networks has led to new sampling methods for estimating and reaching populations that are hard to enumerate (for example, homeless people or intravenous drug users.) For example, respondent driven sampling is a network-based sampling technique that relies on respondents to a survey recommending further respondents.\n\nThe field of sociology focuses almost entirely on networks of outcomes of social interactions. More narrowly, economic sociology considers behavioral interactions of individuals and groups through social capital and social \"markets\". Sociologists, such as Mark Granovetter, have developed core principles about the interactions of social structure, information, ability to punish or reward, and trust that frequently recur in their analyses of political, economic and other institutions. Granovetter examines how social structures and social networks can affect economic outcomes like hiring, price, productivity and innovation and describes sociologists' contributions to analyzing the impact of social structure and networks on the economy.\n\nAnalysis of social networks is increasingly incorporated into health care analytics, not only in epidemiological studies but also in models of patient communication and education, disease prevention, mental health diagnosis and treatment, and in the study of health care organizations and systems.\n\nHuman ecology is an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary study of the relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments. The scientific philosophy of human ecology has a diffuse history with connections to geography, sociology, psychology, anthropology, zoology, and natural ecology.\n\nStudies of language and linguistics, particularly evolutionary linguistics, focus on the development of linguistic forms and transfer of changes, sounds or words, from one language system to another through networks of social interaction. Social networks are also important in language shift, as groups of people add and/or abandon languages to their repertoire.\n\nIn the study of literary systems, network analysis has been applied by Anheier, Gerhards and Romo, De Nooy, and Senekal, to study various aspects of how literature functions. The basic premise is that polysystem theory, which has been around since the writings of Even-Zohar, can be integrated with network theory and the relationships between different actors in the literary network, e.g. writers, critics, publishers, literary histories, etc., can be mapped using visualization from SNA.\n\nResearch studies of formal or informal organization relationships, organizational communication, economics, economic sociology, and other resource transfers. Social networks have also been used to examine how organizations interact with each other, characterizing the many informal connections that link executives together, as well as associations and connections between individual employees at different organizations. Intra-organizational networks have been found to affect organizational commitment, organizational identification, interpersonal citizenship behaviour.\n\nSocial capital is a form of economic and cultural capital in which social networks are central, transactions are marked by reciprocity, trust, and cooperation, and market agents produce goods and services not mainly for themselves, but for a common good.\n\nSocial capital is a sociological concept about the value of social relations and the role of cooperation and confidence to achieve positive outcomes. The term refers to the value one can get from their social ties. For example, newly arrived immigrants can make use of their social ties to established migrants to acquire jobs they may otherwise have trouble getting (e.g., because of unfamiliarity with the local language). A positive relationship exists between social capital and the intensity of social network use. In a dynamic framework, higher activity in a network feeds into higher social capital which itself encourages more activity.\n\nIn many organizations, members tend to focus their activities inside their own groups, which stifles creativity and restricts opportunities. A player whose network bridges structural holes has an advantage in detecting and developing rewarding opportunities. Such a player can mobilize social capital by acting as a \"broker\" of information between two clusters that otherwise would not have been in contact, thus providing access to new ideas, opinions and opportunities. British philosopher and political economist John Stuart Mill, writes, \"it is hardly possible to overrate the value ... of placing human beings in contact with persons dissimilar to themselves... Such communication [is] one of the primary sources of progress.\" Thus, a player with a network rich in structural holes can add value to an organization through new ideas and opportunities. This in turn, helps an individual's career development and advancement.\n\nA social capital broker also reaps control benefits of being the facilitator of information flow between contacts. In the case of consulting firm Eden McCallum, the founders were able to advance their careers by bridging their connections with former big three consulting firm consultants and mid-size industry firms. By bridging structural holes and mobilizing social capital, players can advance their careers by executing new opportunities between contacts.\n\nThere has been research that both substantiates and refutes the benefits of information brokerage. A study of high tech Chinese firms by Zhixing Xiao found that the control benefits of structural holes are \"dissonant to the dominant firm-wide spirit of cooperation and the information benefits cannot materialize due to the communal sharing values\" of such organizations. However, this study only analyzed Chinese firms, which tend to have strong communal sharing values. Information and control benefits of structural holes are still valuable in firms that are not quite as inclusive and cooperative on the firm-wide level. In 2004, Ronald Burt studied 673 managers who ran the supply chain for one of America's largest electronics companies. He found that managers who often discussed issues with other groups were better paid, received more positive job evaluations and were more likely to be promoted. Thus, bridging structural holes can be beneficial to an organization, and in turn, to an individual's career.\n\nComputer networks combined with social networking software produces a new medium for social interaction. A relationship over a computerized social networking service can be characterized by context, direction, and strength. The content of a relation refers to the resource that is exchanged. In a computer mediated communication context, social pairs exchange different kinds of information, including sending a data file or a computer program as well as providing emotional support or arranging a meeting. With the rise of electronic commerce, information exchanged may also correspond to exchanges of money, goods or services in the \"real\" world. Social network analysis methods have become essential to examining these types of computer mediated communication.\n\nIn addition, the sheer size and the volatile nature of social media has given rise to new network metrics. A key concern with networks extracted from social media is the lack of robustness of network metrics given missing data.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Through approaching mythology as language, Lévi-Strauss suggests that it can be approached the same way as language can be approached by the same structuralist methods used to address language. Thus, Lévi-Strauss offers a structuralist theory of mythology; he clarifies, \"Myth is language, functioning on an especially high level where meaning succeeds practically at 'taking off' from the linguistic ground on which it keeps rolling.\" \n\nLévi-Strauss breaks down his argument into three main parts. Meaning is not isolated within the specific fundamental parts of the myth, but rather within the composition of these parts. Although myth and language are of similar categories, language functions differently in myth. Finally, language in myth exhibits more complex functions than in any other linguistic expression. From these suggestions, he draws the conclusion that myth can be broken down into constituent units, and these units are different from the constituents of language. Finally, unlike the constituents of language, the constituents of a myth, which he labels “mythemes,” function as \"bundles of relations.\" \n\nThis approach is a break from the “symbolists”, such as Carl Jung, who dedicate themselves to find meaning solely within the constituents rather than their relations. For instance, Lévi-Strauss uses the example of the Oedipus myth and breaks it down to its component parts:\n\nReading it in sequence from left to right, top to bottom, the myth is categorized sequentially and by similarities. Through analyzing the commonalities between the “mythemes” of the Oedipus story, understandings can be wrought from its categories. \n\nThus, a structural approach towards myths is to address all of these constituents. Furthermore, a structural approach should account for all versions of a myth, as all versions are relevant to the function of the myth as a whole. This leads to what Lévi-Strauss calls a spiral growth of the myth which is continuous while the structure itself is not. The growth of the myth only ends when the \n“intellectual impulse which has produced it is exhausted.” \n\nMyths are primarily acknowledged as oral traditions, while literature is in the form of written text. Still, anthropologists and literary critics would both acknowledge the links between myths and relatively more contemporary literature. Therefore, many literary critics take the same Lévi-Straussian structuralist, as it is coined, approach to literature. This approach is, again, similar to Symbolist critics’ approach to literature. There is a search for the lowest constituent of the story. But as with the myth, Lévi-Straussian structuralism then analyzes the relations between these constituent parts in order to compare even greater relations between versions of stories as well as among stories themselves. \n\nFurthermore, Lévi-Strauss suggests that the structural approach and mental processes dedicated towards analyzing the myth are similar in nature to those in science. This connection between myth and science is further elaborated in his books, “Myth and Meaning” and \"The Savage Mind\". He suggests that the foundation of structuralism is based upon an innate understanding of the scientific process, which seeks to break down complex phenomena into its component parts and then analyze the relations between them. The structuralist approach to myth is precisely the same method, and as a method this can be readily applied to literature.\n\n"}

Its publishers, the Bible Literacy Project, say the textbook allows schools to study the Bible academically while fully respecting the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. It is designed for teaching either a semester course or a full-year course on the literary and historical influence of the Bible.\n\nThe development took over five years, at a cost of $2 million, with contributions from 40 evangelical, Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Jewish and secular experts and scholars. \n\nAs of September 2010, the Bible Literacy Project reports that the textbook has been adopted by 470 schools in 43 states, with more than 100 schools in Texas teaching Bible literacy courses. On October 11, 2007, \"The Bible and Its Influence\" was designated by the Alabama State Board of Education as an approved textbook statewide. This designation allows schools throughout the state to purchase the curriculum with state funds.\n\n\"The Bible and Its Influence\" has received extensive press coverage. The cover story of \"TIME\" on April 2, 2007, described the rising trend in Bible courses in public schools nationwide. \"TIME\" senior religion editor David Van Biema stated, \"Public school Bible electives should have a strong accompanying textbook on the model of \"The Bible and Its Influence\", but one that is willing to deal a bit more bluntly with the historical warts.\"\n\nIn May 2007, \"The Bible and Its Influence\" was also featured in \"Education Week\" and on NBC's \"Today\" show.

Director Philip Kaufman and screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière portray the effect on Czechoslovak artistic and intellectual life during the 1968 Prague Spring of socialist liberalization preceding the invasion by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact that ushered in a period of communist repression. It portrays the moral, political, and psycho-sexual consequences for three bohemian friends: a surgeon, and two female artists with whom he has a sexual relationship.\n\nTomas, a successful brain surgeon in Communist Czechoslovakia, is pursuing an affair with Sabina, an equally care-free artist in Prague. Dr Tomas takes a trip to a spa town for a specialized surgery. There, he meets dissatisfied waitress Tereza, who desires intellectual stimulation. She tracks him down in Prague and moves in with him, complicating Tomas's affairs.\n\nTomas asks Sabina to help Tereza find work as a photographer. Tereza is fascinated and jealous as she grasps that Sabina and Tomas are lovers, but feels affection for Sabina. Nevertheless, Tomas marries Tereza, in a simple ceremony with both perpetually laughing, followed by her double standard distress about Tomas' promiscuity. Although she considers leaving Tomas, she becomes more attached to Tomas when the Soviet Army invades Czechoslovakia. Amidst the confusion, Tereza photographs demonstrations against the Soviet forces, then hands the rolls of film to foreigners to smuggle to the West. Facing the stultifying reality that replaced the Prague Spring, Tomas, Sabina and Tereza flee Czechoslovakia for Switzerland: first Sabina, then the hesitant Tomas and Tereza.\n\nIn Geneva, Sabina encounters Franz, a married university professor: they begin a love affair. After some time, he decides to abandon his wife and family for her. After hearing the declaration, Sabina abandons Franz, feeling he would emotionally weigh her down. Meanwhile, Tereza and Tomas attempt to adapt to Switzerland, whose people Tereza finds inhospitable. When she discovers that Tomas continues womanizing, she leaves him and returns to Czechoslovakia. Upset by her leaving, Tomas follows Tereza to Czechoslovakia, where his passport is confiscated, trapping him in-country: nevertheless, his return elates Tereza. They are re-united.\n\nIn Prague, Tomas has resumed his brain surgeon position, but his having written a scathing article criticizing the Soviet-backed Czech régime before the invasion, in which he berated them for claiming ignorance of Soviet political purges but seeming unremorseful, and noting that Oedipus Rex plucked out his eyes upon understanding his crime, but the autocratic figures had not, has rendered him a political dissident and has jeopardized his re-employment. The régime demands his signature to a letter repudiating the article, claiming that Tomas' article fueled the anti-communist sentiment. Tomas refuses and is presumably black-listed from practising medicine. Tomas is apparently a window washer, and is recognized by the daughter of a high-ranking official, aware of her family connection, brazenly does his trademark \"take off your clothes\" line that is successful in examining a \"pain in her back\".\n\nAs a waitress, Tereza meets an engineer who propositions her. Aware of Tomas's infidelity, she encounters a one-time and passionless sexual liaison with the engineer. Remorseful, she fears the engineer might have been a secret agent for the régime, who might denounce her and Tomas. She contemplates suicide at a canal bank; by chance, Tomas passes by Tereza and woos her back.\n\nStressed by insubstantial city life, Tereza convinces Tomas to leave Prague for the country: they go to a village where an old patient of Tomas's welcomes them. In the village, they live an idyllic life, far from the political intrigues of Prague. In contrast, Sabina has gone to the US, where she continues her detached bohemian lifestyle. Later, Sabina is shocked by the letter telling of the fate of Tereza and Tomas in a fatal traffic accident while returning after drinking in a tavern.\n\nThe film was an American production with American director, Philip Kaufman, but it features a largely European cast, including Daniel Day-Lewis (British), Juliette Binoche (French), Lena Olin, Erland Josephson and Stellan Skarsgård (Swedish), Pavel Landovský (Czech) and Derek de Lint (Dutch). It was filmed in France as opposed to the plot setting: in the scenes depicting the Soviet invasion, archival footage is combined with new material shot in Lyon. The scene in which Tomas is seduced by a woman while cleaning windows was shot in the then unrestored Hôtel de Beauvais in the 4th arrondissement of Paris (now the Administrative Appeal Court).\n\nKundera served as an active consultant during the making of the film. Kundera wrote the poem that Tomas whispers into Tereza's ear as she is falling asleep specifically for the film.\n\nHowever, in a note to the Czech edition of the book, Kundera remarks that the movie had very little to do with the spirit either of the novel or the characters in it. In the same note Kundera goes on to say that after this experience he no longer allows any adaptations of his work. Many critics have focused on how much of the book was successfully captured, or could be captured, on film: however, some commentators, such as Cattrysse Patrick, have argued that the film must be viewed in a different light, with the book as only one source of inspiration.\n\nThe film garnered high praise from critics. Jean-Claude Carrière and Philip Kaufman were nominated at the Academy Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was listed 87th by the American Film Institute in its 2002 list AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions.\n\nA digitally restored version of the film was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection in November 1999. The release includes audio commentary by director Philip Kaufman, co-writer Jean-Claude Carrière, editor Walter Murch and actress Lena Olin. It was re-released on DVD by Warner Home Video as a 2-disc special edition on February 28, 2006.\n\nThe film makes use of music by Leoš Janáček and also Marta Kubišová singing \"Hey Jude\" in Czech.\n\n"}

{"id": "46309686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46309686", "title": "Titanfall 2", "text": "Titanfall 2\n\nTitanfall 2 is a first-person shooter video game, developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. A sequel to 2014's \"Titanfall\", the game was released worldwide on October 28, 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In \"Titanfall 2\", players control Titans, mecha-style exoskeletons and their pilots, who are agile and equipped with a variety of skills ranging from wall-running to cloaking. Set in a science fiction universe, the single-player campaign follows the story of Jack Cooper, a rifleman from Frontier Militia, who bonds with his Titan BT-7274 after an accident. Together, they embark on a quest to stop the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) from launching a superweapon.\n\nThe game's development began in mid-2014, and the title had a two-year development cycle. The decision to add a single-player campaign to the game came about because the team wanted to expand the game's player base. They came up with different ideas and prototypes, and integrated them to form a single coherent campaign. \"Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet\" and buddy cop films, as well as the video game \"Half-Life\" inspired the game's campaign and narrative. The team also overhauled the progression system and made subtle changes to the multiplayer to make the game fairer to players. Valve Corporation's Source engine powers the game. Stephen Barton returned to compose the game's music.\n\nUpon release, the game received critical acclaim. The single-player campaign was praised for its design and execution, and the multiplayer modes for building on the foundation of the original game. Despite the positive reception, \"Titanfall 2\" underperformed commercially, with most attributing its underwhelming performance to it going on sale in a crowded release window, being placed between the release of \"Battlefield 1\" and \"\". It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades including Game of the Year and Best Shooter awards, by several gaming publications. Respawn continued to support the game after its release, providing several updates and free downloadable content.\n\nSimilar to its predecessor, \"Titanfall 2\" is a first-person shooter game where players can control both a pilot and their Titans—mecha-style exoskeletons. The pilot has an large variety of abilities that enhance their efficiency during combat. These include cloaking, grappling, and parkour—such as double-jumping and wall-running—with the aid of a jump kit. These movements can be chained together to travel between locations quickly. The game introduces several new gameplay mechanics. These include: a movement system that allows players to slide on the ground, the pulse blade (which is a throwing knife that reveals the location of any nearby enemy), the holo-pilot, (a holographic pilot that mimics players' action to confuse enemies), and a grappling hook, which can be used to slingshot players to a building or an enemy it attaches to. The pilots have a large arsenal of gadgets and weapons, such as shotguns, submachine guns, pistols and grenades to fight their enemies. At close range, players can execute their opponents from behind with a melee attack.\n\nTitans are significantly less mobile than the pilots, but they have stronger firearms and armor. Replacing the three classes featured in the first \"Titanfall\", seven Titans are introduced—Ion, Scorch, Northstar, Ronin, Tone, Legion, and Monarch. Ion uses a directed-energy arsenal. Scorch engages in combat using area-denial incendiary weaponry, Northstar excels in long-range precision attacks and setting traps, and is the only Titan with the ability to hover. Ronin specializes in close quarters combat, using a shotgun and a sword. Tone focuses on mid-range combat with its target locking weapons. Legion uses a minigun designed for defense and controlling combat zones. Finally, Monarch—added post-release via downloadable content (DLC)—is a Vanguard-class chassis that can steal power from other Titans to power up its own defensive shield. The Titans have their own move sets which are different from those of the pilots—for instance, they can dodge quickly to evade attacks.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, \"Titanfall 2\" has a single-player story campaign with gameplay split between commanding the Titan and controlling the pilot. It features a linear story, but levels offer players multiple paths to explore. For most parts of the game the Titan BT-7274 accompanies players. It can change its weapon loadouts under players' command to maximize its efficiency when combating different Titan variants. These loadouts are unlocked after players defeat an enemy boss. Players are allowed to use multiple ways to complete objectives and attack enemies, such as utilizing stealth, or using firearms provided in the game. Levels are large, and there are multiple paths for players to choose from to reach their destination. The game also features platform elements, which task players to make use of Cooper's parkour abilities to solve environmental puzzles, and travel to previously inaccessible areas. Some weapons are level-specific and can only be used in certain regions. There are also level-specific gameplay mechanics. For instance, in the \"Effect and Cause\" level, players are required to shift between modern times and the past with a temporal device. Players can also select dialogue options and talk to the Titan at certain points in the campaign. The single-player also features a training gauntlet, which acts as a tutorial for players. The faster they complete the gauntlet, the higher their position will be on a leaderboard.\n\nThe multiplayer mode introduces a Titan meter, which fills slowly when the player is playing the game. It fills faster when the player kills an opponent, inflicts damage on enemies, or completes certain objectives. When a certain percentage of the meter is filled, the player can summon a Titan, which descends from the sky. A Titan can crush opponents if it lands on one when summoned. When the Titan meter is filled completely while in a Titan, the Titan can use their core ability, which inflicts a lot more damage than typical attacks. Pilot players can steal a Titan battery, causing damage to it. The battery can also be taken and implemented on a friendly Titan, recharging its shield and filling the Titan meter. Players can disembark from their Titan at any time. It will continue attacking nearby opponents under \"follow mode\", where the Titan follows the pilot as closely as it can. Players can also set it to \"guard mode\" and it will stay put.\n\nPlayers earn \"merits\" based on their performance in a multiplayer match whether their team wins or loses. Merits are experience points through participating in the match or getting access to unlocks. Players need to accumulate merits to level up, which unlocks additional weapons, abilities and more. There are also other ways to earn merits, like surviving the evacuation phase when the players' team loses a match. Players can also earn Credits, a form of currency used to buy weapons, boosts, Titans, or abilities before they are unlocked. These can be earned by gaining merits and completing challenges. The game's customization options have expanded significantly compared to \"Titanfall\". Players' outfits and weapons, as well as Titans' appearances and combat efficiency, can be extensively customized. Boosts replace burn cards featured in the earlier game. They are tactical abilities that enhance the players' combat efficiency. Each boost has its own specific access requirement. Ticks, which are explosive mines that track enemies, for example, require 65% of the Titan meter filled. Amped Weapons, where players inflict more damage with their firearms, need 80%. Players must decide which boost they are going to use before a match begins; they cannot swap their boost during the game.\n\n\"Titanfall 2\" features several of multiplayer modes at launch. These modes include:\n\nMatchmaking is also enhanced, with the game automatically helping players to find a new match after the end of every match. The game also introduces a new feature called \"Networks\", which allows players to form a group, similar to a guild. The game automatically groups both the player and other members of the network together in a match. Players can join more than one network and can switch between joined networks in-game. Each network has its own \"happy hour\". If the player plays the game during this period, they gain extra merits.\n\nThe game's conflict takes place in \"The Frontier\", a region of star systems far removed from the \"Core Systems\" where Earth is located. The Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) and the Frontier Militia battle for control of the Frontier. The IMC seeks to exploit the Frontier's rich resources regardless of the consequences for planetary environments and civilian populations, while the Militia fight to expel the IMC and gain the Frontier's independence. In the wake of the Battle of Demeter, the Militia is on the offensive, battling for resources and control of the Frontier planets. Though weakened by the lack of reinforcements from the core systems because of the destruction of the refueling facility by James MacAllan, IMC is still a dominant fighting force attempting to drive the Militia out and put down any resistance to their control of the Frontier.\n\nIn the singleplayer campaign the player assumes control of Jack Cooper, a rifleman from the Frontier Militia, sent to the alien planet of Typhon who must join his former squadmate's Titan—named BT-7274—to fight local alien creatures and human enemies from the IMC.\n\nJack Cooper is a rifleman in the Militia. He aspires to become a Titan Pilot for the Militia and is receiving off-the-books training from Captain Tai Lastimosa to prepare for his candidacy. The two are part of a Militia force which attacks the IMC-held planet of Typhon. In the initial battle, the Apex Predators, a group of mercenaries contracted to the IMC and led by Blisk, mortally wound Lastimosa and incapacitate his Vanguard-class Titan, BT-7274. Lastimosa transfers control of BT to Cooper. BT explains that Cooper has also inherited Lastimosa's mission, Special Operation 217: to rendezvous with Major Anderson and assist in the completion of their original assignment. Anderson's last known position is at an IMC laboratory. BT and Cooper are forced to detour through a manufacturing plant where they are ambushed and separated. Cooper fights through the factory alone until he is trapped in a combat simulation being run by the mercenary Ash, who is using captured Militia soldiers as test subjects to test the potency of IMC machine units. Cooper escapes, and after being reunited with BT, defeats Ash.\n\nBT and Cooper continue to the IMC laboratory only to find it destroyed, and corpses artificially aged due to time-travel distortion. Anderson is present, though also deceased from a time-travel mishap. Cooper learns Anderson was gathering intelligence on a new IMC device, the \"Fold Weapon\", which utilizes time-displacement technology to destroy entire planets. The planet Harmony, which is the home planet of Lastimosa and houses the Militia headquarters, will be the first target. Fortunately for the Militia, the Fold Weapon is dependent upon a power source known as the Ark. Cooper and BT hijack an IMC communications array and broadcast a signal to the Militia fleet. The transmission contained sensor data on the Ark's electromagnetic signature so that the Militia could find and seize it.\n\nAfter receiving the transmission, Militia's military unit, the Marauder Corps, leads an assault against the IMC-held installation where the Ark is being kept. Arriving too late to prevent it from being loaded onto an IMC transport, the Militia give chase in hijacked IMC ships. The mercenary Viper nearly kills BT and Cooper by throwing them off their transport, but freelance pilot Barker rescues them by catching them with his dropship. Cooper regroups with a friendly mercenary group called the Six Four, and the Pilots secure the IMC ship nearest to the Draconis, the transport carrying the Ark. Barker drops off BT and Cooper. They face off with Viper who falls out of the sky after a short skirmish. BT and Cooper attempt to board the Draconis but are again interrupted by Viper. BT loses an arm in the battle, but Cooper kills Viper by shooting his exposed body after his Titan's hatch is blown off.\n\nCooper and BT successfully board the Draconis holding the Ark, and they secure it before the ship crashes. BT becomes incapacitated from damage sustained in his fight with Viper, and the duo are captured by Blisk and his second-in-command, Slone. BT surrenders the Ark to save Cooper but is destroyed by Slone for trying to help Cooper escape. However, BT gives Cooper his data core before he dies, and Cooper uses it to revive BT by installing it in a Vanguard chassis provided by Briggs after he escapes captivity. Reunited, Cooper and BT fight their way to the base where the Fold Weapon is being prepared for use against Harmony. They kill Slone, earning Blisk's respect; Blisk spares Cooper because the IMC never included killing him in their contract and he does not work for free. He offers Cooper a place in the Apex Predators before departing. BT and Cooper then launch themselves into the Fold Weapon's superstructure where the Ark has already been installed. BT hurls Cooper free before sacrificing himself by killing himself, destroying the Ark and the Fold Weapon and the planet Complex.\n\nThe game ends with a monologue by Cooper, talking about having his status as a pilot affirmed and being inducted into the Marauder Corps, as well as reminiscing over his experiences with BT. The Titan neural link to Cooper's helmet flashes with the message \"Jack?\" encoded in binary.\n\nRespawn Entertainment, founded by Vince Zampella, and a team of ninety people developed the game. \"Titanfall\"s original director, Steve Fukuda, producer Drew McCoy, and composer Stephen Barton returned for the sequel. Production of the title began in mid-2014 with a two-year development cycle. Publisher Electronic Arts provided funding and marketing support. The game's development was completed on September 29, 2016, with Respawn confirming it had been declared gold, indicating it was being prepared for duplication and release.\n\n\"Titanfall\" had a low engagement with players post-release, despite huge initial sales. Fukuda believed the dwindling size of the community was due mainly to the game's lack of a single-player campaign. Zampella confirmed the introduction of a single-player campaign was intended to expand the player base, and McCoy believed this could make the overall package more complete. The team's vision for the campaign was to make it different from other first-person shooters, especially \"Call of Duty\". This proved to be a challenge since many of them had worked at Infinity Ward, the developer of \"Call of Duty\", before joining Respawn and had become accustomed to making a campaign in that style. According to McCoy, the team initially tried putting all the mechanics from the first \"Titanfall\" into the campaign, but it did not work out. As a result, the team decided to host many game jams in the studio, where team members were free to create new designs and experiment with technology with few constraints other than adhering to \"Titanfall\"s existing mechanics. The team was tasked not to follow traditional shooter campaign's design conventions. Team members were free to build prototypes for it, which would then be integrated to form a coherent campaign. These prototypes were internally referred to as \"action blocks\". They allowed the team to introduce \"ideas after ideas\" in the full game since these blocks were often independent of each other and had unique gameplay features. For instance, players would be time traveling in one level and assaulting Titans in the next. These blocks enabled the team to discover new ideas and work out the structure of the overall campaign. Internally it was called \"211\" as every level consisted of two parts involving pilot combat, one part involving pilot movement and puzzle solving, and one part involving Titan combat.\nThe \"action blocks\" approach meant \"Titanfall 2\"s gameplay was designed before the story. The team intended making the game similar to the \"Half-Life\" series, where a mystery takes center stage in the story, hooking players to continue exploring it and completing the campaign. \"Portal\" also influenced the game's design. One of the major components of the campaign is the interactions between Cooper and his Titan BT-7274. Fukuda described it as a \"buddy\" story, inspired by buddy cop films like \"Lethal Weapon\" or \"Beverly Hills Cop\", as well as anime \"Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet\". \"BT\" stood for \"Buddy Titan\", a name the team hated, but Fukuda insisted on using. To increase the chemistry between the duo, the two characters have opposite personalities: Jack is enthusiastic, while BT is robotic and calm. Cooper was difficult for the team to write since his personality may not align with players' choices or vision for the character. While the team intentionally avoided making BT similar to characters like Optimus Prime or cute robots like Wall-E, they found BT's personality difficult to write, as they had to find a balance between making it \"a lovable partner and a 20-foot-tall war machine\". Early drafts of BT's scripts were deemed too \"bossy\", and five writers took five months to rework them. To make BT more human, the team designed a large emotive eye, so players would know where the titan is looking, and a small pair of robotic arms that allow it to interact with other characters in a more natural way. The front of BT is filled with colored paints which inform players of the Titan's head movement. The team added a design choice that let players communicate with BT enabling players to bond with the Titan without using any cutscene. This also provided players with more insights into the game's world, though some staff questioned the decision since \"Half-Life\"'s protagonist is silenced. To make players feel that Cooper and BT are separate entities even when they are controlling the Titan, the team included several small graphical hints to remind them that BT will still continue to talk to the player character. Akira Kurosawa films and Clint Eastwood and Sam Elliott's cowboy roles inspired animator Shawn Lee Wilson creation of BT's unique physical appearance and expression. The Apache helicopter and other military technologies also inspired BT's design. Wilson provided motion capture for the Titan.\n\nWhile designing the game's single-player, one of the team's goals was to keep the energy present in \"Titanfall\"s multiplayer mode. The team wanted to make the campaign more creative instead of simply having robots in it. Both the unique traits of pilots and Titans had to be used and expanded upon. Therefore, the team decided to create both intricate environments for pilots' transversal and large open space for titan combat, instead of making it a corridor shooter. According to gameplay designer Mohammed Alavi, this gave players greater control and freedom over the character's movement. The team focused a great deal on platforming designed to further expand the use of the pilot movement sets. Many team members created action blocks dedicated to platforming, including ideas such as having players solve puzzles to find a new surface to wall-run on, and Titan being able to throw the pilot, so they could travel over long distances. The concept of Titan throwing pilots was ultimately discarded from the gameplay and became part of a cinematic cutscene because the team had trouble implementing it due to its lack of interactivity. The game also features a variety of puzzles inspired by \"BioShock\" and \"Half-Life\", where players maintain \"a certain level of speed\" while solving puzzles. There are also puzzles which change the game's pace and require players to stop to think of a solution.\n\n\"X2\"s Nightcrawler and the documentary series \"Life After People\" inspired the most acclaimed level, \"Effect and Cause\", initially an action block created by designer Jake Keating involving time travel. He had the idea before the development of \"Titanfall\". He experimented with it with one of \"Titanfall\"s multiplayer maps. The action block was warmly welcomed by the entire development team, with some feeling that it had the potential to be the main feature through the entire game rather than being confined to one level. However, Keating insisted on limiting its use to one level so that the mechanic would not become boring for players. To make the level, the team created two building computer models with one on top of the other. As the player switches timelines, they are teleported from one building to the other. Fukuda added it was the landmark level the team was looking for and it did not need demanding technology. However, the added level created more work for the team since the two buildings, each with different features and characteristics, needed to be built twice.\n\nThe game's single-player starts with simple missions before gradually introducing players to more complicated situations which demand more skills and precision. The game story also supplements this, as Cooper transforms from a normal Frontier grunt to a skillful pilot at the end. The campaign was created as a stepping stone for inexperienced players by providing a more \"relaxing\" environment that teaches players' the basic gameplay mechanics, training them before they join multiplayer matches.\n\nThe team evaluated \"Titanfall\" and listened to both feedback and analytical research from gaming journalists and identified two major concerns: there was not enough content for players, and at times the game became too chaotic. The team slowed down the gameplay pace of \"Titanfall 2\"s multiplayer so that players could actively make decisions relying less on reflex. The team also improved the game's map design by introducing more verticality to each map. Fukuda described it as the 3D swiss cheese effect. The team also employed the strategy of \"window pane\", where each map has three obvious paths: left, middle and right. This helped make each map's environments more predictable to players. \"Titanfall2\" features a brighter color pattern and environment compared to both the first game and other military shooters, as the team aimed for graphical quality that is \"postcard-worthy\". There is also a greater variety of environments featured in the multiplayer maps, ranging from industrial centers to outdoor maps with more foliage.\n\nThere are also various revisions to the game's multiplayer mode. McCoy described these changes as \"subtle\" as the team focused more on adding slight modifications to existing mechanics. The Titans were redesigned so that players can \"tell at a glance everything that [they] need to know\" and stay prepared for each combat encounter. This enabled players to have a clearer picture of the combat situations and facilitated learning from each defeat. The team also introduced cosmetic changes to the pilots and the six Titan class giving them distinct visual characteristics so that players can easily identify an opponent. The team attempted to add more depth to the gameplay by introducing more Titans, gadgets and pilot abilities, allowing players to play in accordance with their own playstyle. These added more variety to the game so there are more things for players to discover and master. The game's extensive customization options, and the class-based progression system, were designed to engage players, so they can \"get the most out of the game\". Unlike its predecessor, Titans need to be earned using certain gameplay actions. The principle behind the design was to make Titan gameplay more satisfying and rewarding.\n\nThe game used a heavily modified version of Valve Corporation's Source as its game engine. Many improvements were made to the engine's aspects such as physically based rendering, a texture streaming system developed in house, high dynamic range and depth of field. The team also made changes to the audio, such as introducing sound occlusion and reverberation. According to John Haggerty, senior software engineer, the team broke part of the engine's code for level progression and saves when they were making the first game. The programming team found it a huge challenge to fix and reinstate these codes to accommodate the sequel's single-player campaign. The team also developed a scripting system from scratch, allowing designers to quickly assemble action blocks. The game's artificial intelligence was significantly enhanced, with new movesets and behaviors for pilots and titans in both single-player and multiplayer modes. As \"Titanfall 2\" was the first game Respawn developed for the PlayStation 4, the engineering team spent a lot of time and effort to get it running on the platform. A virtual reality version of the game was prototyped but never went into full production because, according to Joe Emslie, the player would \"vomit all over their controller.\"\n\nCombat animation can be interrupted by players' movement, which gives them more direct control instead of needing to wait for the animation to end. Most \"Titanfall\"s pilots' movesets returned in \"Titanfall 2\" but with some slight modifications. For instance, players no longer fall off as they are wall running near the tops of walls. Before players begin to wall run, the game's camera also tilts slightly so that players can anticipate the movement.\n\nIn May 2014, two months after the first game's release, publisher Electronic Arts announced they would collaborate with Respawn Entertainment for more experiences set within the \"Titanfall\" universe. A sequel was officially confirmed on March 12, 2015, by Respawn's Vince Zampella at the 12th British Academy Games Awards. He also confirmed the game would come to PlayStation 4, unlike the first one. EA opened their press conference at EA Play 2016 with \"Titanfall 2\", and announced that the game would be released worldwide on October 28, 2016. This meant the title would have to compete with other triple-A first-person shooters including \"Battlefield 1\", made by DICE (one of EA's studios), and Activision's futuristic \"\", developed by Zampella's old studio Infinity Ward. According to McCoy, EA confirmed the release date long before and the team could not change it. The game's Collector's Edition and Vanguard SRS Collector's Edition, which include additional content, were released on the same day as the standard edition. \"Titanfall 2\" was added to EA Access and Origin Access on July 7, 2017. An Ultimate Edition, which bundles the base game and all the updates as well as some bonus content, was released on the same day.\n\nEA partnered with a restaurant and a snack food company to promote the game. Players who purchased food or drink at any Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant received a free customization item and access to a multiplayer mode. Similarly, players who purchased Mountain Dew or Doritos were given a code granting them double XP, early access to a new multiplayer mode, a Titan, and Titan customization items. EA also partnered with toy manufacturer McFarlane Toys to produce a toyline for the game which includes a seven-inch tall Cooper figurine and a ten-inch tall BT-7274 figurine. Respawn prepared two technical tests for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One users in August 2016, allowing players to try some of the game's multiplayer modes and maps. They made several major gameplay adjustments after hearing feedback from players participating in these tests. The official \"Titanfall\" Twitter account, controlled by EA rather than Respawn, also helped promote the game by suggesting it to Twitter users who indicated they were looking for games to play. It was also used to mock its competitors. Players who purchased \"Battlefield 1\" and this game also had exclusive access to a Titan skin inspired by World War One.\n\nAt E3 2016, Respawn announced that all the updates and downloadable content would be free for all players. Inspired by \"Evolve\"s free maps model, the team hoped this approach would make players more satisfied with the full-priced package. Respawn supported the game with multiple pieces of downloadable content in the first year after the game's release, including:\n\nThe game's plot received positive reviews. Nic Rowen of \"Destructoid\" found it had an unsurprising and \"by the number\" sci-fi plot. He was disappointed by the campaign's five-hour length and noted that the emotional core of the story lacked development. \"Game Informer\"'s Javy Gwaltney compared the plot to a \"buddy comedy\" remarking positively that BT is a relatable character. Peter Paras of Game Revolution praised the interesting story, despite feeling the nine-chapter story is basic. He also liked BT's personality, calling it a \"straight-laced 'I take what you say literally' thinking machine\". He noted the interactions with the Titan successfully added more context to the game's world and setting. Jon Denton of Eurogamer praised BT's character, saying its lines were skillfully written. GameSpot's Mike Mahardy felt the story was poorly written and that it ended abruptly. Arthur Gies of \"Polygon\" felt the narrative was subpar, with mediocre voice acting, \"corny names\" for characters, and insufficient context for players to truly remember the story.\n\n\"Titanfall 2\" gameplay received critical acclaim. Rowen described it as \"frantic and exhilarating\", saying the fluidity of gameplay further enhanced the quality of the single-player campaign. Gwaltney shared similar thoughts, saying that no matter how players chose to approach a mission, combat or stealth, it was satisfying. Furthermore, he found controlling the Titan an interesting experience that resembles \"MechWarrior\" and \"Star Fox\". Mahardy also felt that player movement controls remained \"invigorating\". He liked the Titan combat more for often presenting \"David versus Goliath\" scenarios. Mahardy and described the game as a \"thinking man\"s shooter, adding it required players to think tactically instead of simply having good reflexes. David Houghton of GamesRadar praised the game's controls and movement options for turning many seemingly gameplay obstacles and barriers into opportunities for players to manipulate. Chris Thursten of \"PC Gamer\" praised the game's variety of weapons and their sounds and the \"brilliant\" freedom of movement.\n\nRowen praised the level design, which he found one of the game's \"real stars\". He was impressed by the variety of settings and set pieces featured in each level and praised the design for having tricky environments for transversal encouraging free movements. He singled out \"Effect and Cause\" as one of the game's most imaginative levels, comparing it favorably with \"Portal\". Paras remarked that two of the game's chapters were extremely impressive, and that they \"[re-examine] level design in most action games\". Thursten also enjoyed these levels but added that not all of them share this level of creativity. He wished some of the novel concepts introduced \"stuck around longer\" during his playtime. Gwaltney liked the flexibility of the game's campaign, which provides players plenty of freedom to handle combat encounters. He also appreciated the inclusion of the game's puzzles, which requires players to \"think outside the box\". Both Paras and Houghton liked the levels for incorporating elements of Pilot and Titan gameplay. Paras said it added variety to the package, and Houghton felt it improved the game's pacing, making it very \"exhilarating\" to play. Mahardy admired the pacing, attributing its success to the fact that players can switch BT's loadouts to handle various combat situations, presenting a different dynamic from multiplayer. Brandin Tyrrel of IGN admired the game's sense of scale and map design, where each level stage felt large but at the same time linear enough to direct players' progression.\n\nThe game's multiplayer was also acclaimed. Rowen described it as \"more than solid\" and praised the more complex and extended progression system for rectifying \"Titanfall\"s lack of long-term appeal. While Titan's customization became more limited, he felt this was a necessary change to make the Titan combat deeper and more rewarding. He noted there were many \"smart\" gameplay adjustments and design changes that emphasize players' skills, but he was disappointed there were not enough modes featuring AI opponents. Gwaltney, however, felt there were no significant changes to the multiplayer, but there were sufficient subtle design adjustments making it more refined and improved than its predecessor. He still found the progression system lacking in substance. He appreciated the new gadgets, which make the game more tactical. He commented positively on the game modes' structure, which prompts all types of players to engage in teamwork. Paras criticized the multiplayer for being unforgiving, though he enjoyed some of the game modes, like Bounty Hunt. Mahardy praised the six new Titans types for being easy to learn and difficult to master. As the six Titan types have distinct controls and attack schemes, Mahardy noted that combat resembles that of a fighting game and multiplayer online battle arenas games. Tyrrel praised the overhauled rodeo mechanic, which promoted teamwork, and Boosts, which make the game more balanced. Gies described some of the design changes as \"odd\" and \"difficult to understand\", including the rodeo mechanic which he found mostly useless. In addition, he criticized the maps for being too confined, and not fitting with the game's fast gameplay.\n\nCritics generally had a positive reception to the overall package. Rowen admired the game for being an imaginative and creative shooter, one that no other competitor in the market can achieve. Gwaltney described the game as a \"must-play\" that unlike most other shooters offered a complete package with both a fully-fledged single-player campaign and a refined multiplayer. Paras felt that \"Titanfall 2\" successfully delivered on the promises made by the first game. Tyrrel also shared similar opinions, calling the game a rare and exceptional title that improved on every aspect of its predecessor. Houghton called the game the year's surprise, describing it as one of the most \"creative and rewarding FPS in recent memory\". Thursten worried that \"Titanfall 2\" would suffer from a short lifespan like its predecessor due to the same poor release timing. He noted the single-player campaign was the game's true highlight. Denton strongly recommended the game and gave it the highest possible rating, but he shared the same concern as Thursten.\n\nThe game received \"generally positive reviews\" upon release according to review aggregator Metacritic, with the PlayStation 4 version attaining the highest score of 89 out of 100. GamesRadar selected it as their game of the year, while \"PC Gamer\" chose it as their shooter of the year.\n\nElectronic Arts expected the game to sell approximately nine to ten million units in its first year of release. However, financial analysts predicted the game's sales would be substantially disappointing due to EA's decision to release the game in late October, a period between the launch of EA's own \"Battlefield 1\", and Activision's \"\". Despite that, EA expressed no concern about the release window, as they felt that the player base of \"Battlefield 1\" and \"Titanfall 2\" would not overlap.\n\nThe game was the fourth best-selling retail game in the UK in its week of release, behind \"Battlefield 1\", \"\", and \"FIFA 17\". Its first-week sales only reached a quarter of the launch-week sales of \"Titanfall\" despite \"Titanfall 2\" being a multi-platform release. Digital sales of the game were also down, only reaching a quarter of its predecessor's sales. According to the NPD Group, the game was the ninth best-selling game in October 2016 and the fifth best-selling game in November 2016. In their earnings call for the third quarter of the 2017 fiscal year, EA stated that the game's sales fell below expectations. However, EA CEO Blake Jorgensen went on to say the company was pleased with the positive reviews the game received and expected it to have strong sales into the next fiscal year. According to Zampella, \"Titanfall 2\" sold well and was successful, but it could have sold better. In January 2017, financial firm Morgan Stanley estimated that the game had sold 4 million units.\n\nIn October 2016, Zampella said the team would like to deliver more experiences for the player set within the franchise, though a trilogy was not planned. When publisher Electronic Arts acquired Respawn Entertainment, however, it was revealed that a new mainline \"Titanfall\" title was in development.\n"}

Thus, the \"topos\" is a general argument source, from which the individual arguments are instances and is a sort of template from which many individual arguments can be constructed. The word (\"tópos\", literally \"place, location\") is also related to the ancient memory method of \"loci\", by which things to be remembered are recollected by mentally connecting them with successive real or imagined places.\n\nThough the \"Topics\", as a whole, does not deal directly with the \"forms of syllogism\", clearly Aristotle contemplates the use of topics as places from which \"dialectical syllogisms\" (i.e. \"arguments\" from the commonly held , \"éndoxa\") may be derived. This is evidenced by the fact that the introduction to the \"Topics\" contains and relies upon his definition of reasoning (, \"syllogismós\"): \"a verbal expression\" (, \"lógos\") \"in which, certain things having been laid down, other things necessarily follow from these.\". Dialectical reasoning is thereafter divided by Aristotle into inductive and deductive parts. The \"endoxa\" themselves are sometimes, but not always, set out in a propositional form, i.e. an express major or minor proposition, from which the complete syllogism may be constructed. Often, such propositional construction is left as a task to the practitioner of the dialectic art; in these instances Aristotle gives only the general strategy for argument, leaving the \"provision of propositions\" to the ingenuity of the disputant.\n\nBook I of the \"Topics\" is introductory, laying down a number of preliminary principles upon which dialectical argumentation proceeds. After defining \"dialectical\" reasoning (syllogism) and distinguishing it from \"demonstrative\", \"contentious\", and (one might say) \"pseudo-scientific\" syllogism, Aristotle notes the utility of the art of dialectic, then sets out four bases (accident, property, genus, definition) from which invention of such reasoning proceeds. He next elucidates various senses of \"sameness\", as bearing directly upon the usual character of such arguments. \"Dialectical propositions\" and \"dialectical problems\" are characterized. Then, the (\"órgana\") or \"means\" by which arguments may be obtained are described, in a four-fold summary, as:\nMethods and rationale for attaining each of these ends are briefly illustrated and explained.\n\nBook II is devoted to an explication of topics relating to arguments where an \"accident\" (i.e. non-essential attribute, or an attribute that \"may\" or \"may not\" belong) is predicated of a subject.\n\nBook III concerns commonplaces from which things can be discussed with respect to whether they are \"better\" or \"worse\".\n\nBook IV deals with \"genus\"—how it is discovered and what are the sources of argument for and against attribution of a genus.\n\nBook V discusses the base of \"property\"—that which is attributable \"only\" to a particular subject and is not an \"essential\" attribute. Property is subdivided into \"essential\" and \"permanent\", versus \"relative\" and \"temporary\".\n\nBook VI describes \"definition\" and the numerous means that may be used to attack and defend a definition.\n\nBook VII is a short recapitulation of \"definition\" and \"sameness\", and compares the various difficulties involved in forming arguments, both \"pro\" and \"con\", about the other bases of dialectical disputation.\n\nBook VIII (the final book) is a lengthy survey containing suggestions, hints, and some tricks about the technique of organizing and delivering one or the other side of verbal disputation.\n\nThe \"Sophistical Refutations\" is viewed by some as an appendix to the Topics, inasmuch as its final section appears to form an epilogue to both treatises.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4435553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4435553", "title": "Two Years' Vacation", "text": "Two Years' Vacation\n\nTwo Years' Vacation () is an adventure novel by Jules Verne, published in 1888. The story tells of the fortunes of a group of schoolboys stranded on a deserted island in the South Pacific, and of their struggles to overcome adversity. In his preface to the book, Verne explains that his goals were to create a Robinson Crusoe-like environment for children, and to show the world what the intelligence and bravery of a child was capable of when put to the test.\n\nThe story takes place in March, 1860 and opens with a group of schoolboys aged between eight and fourteen on board a 100-ton schooner called the \"Sleuth\" moored at Auckland, New Zealand, and preparing to set off on a six-week vacation. With the exception of the oldest boy Gordon, an American, and Briant and Jack, two French brothers, all the boys are British.\n\nWhile the schooner's crew are ashore, the moorings are cast off under unknown circumstances and the ship drifts to sea, where it is caught by a storm. Twenty-two days later, the boys find themselves cast upon the shore of an uncharted island, which they name \"Chairman Island.\" They go on many adventures and even catch wild animals while trying to survive. They remain there for the next two years until a passing ship sinks in the close vicinity of the island. The ship had been taken over by mutineers, intent on trafficking slaves. With the aid of two of the surviving members of the original crew, the boys are able to defeat the mutineers and make their escape from the island, which they find out is close to the Chilean coast (Hanover-Island located at 50°56’ S, 74°47’ W).\n\nAs with most of Verne's works, it was serialised (in twenty-four parts between January and December 1888) in the \"Extraordinary Journeys\" section of the French \"Magasin d’Éducation et de Récréation\" by Parisian publisher Hetzel. It was also published in book form in two volumes in June and early November of that year. An illustrated double volume with a colour map and a preface by Verne was released in late November.\n\n\n\"Deux ans de vacances\" is the first book Shiori Shiomiya reads from the shelves of the school library during a flashback to her childhood in the anime \"The World God Only Knows\".\n\nThe struggles for survival and dominance amongst the boys were to be echoed in William Golding's \"Lord of the Flies\", written some 66 years later.\n\n"}
